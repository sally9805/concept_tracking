COME winter when Grandpa was 4 boy , he 'd haul out the long johns and woolen shirts , He needed them , for often the only warmth in the house was around the kitchen stove -- and that just made the cold drafts from doors and windows more noticeable . Today we expect even the baby to wear nothing warmer than a diaper while playing in front of the picture window . Your house , whether it 's new or old , can be that cozy . All kinds of materials ? most so easy to apply that your wife can help ? are now available to fill the cracks , stop drafts and keep the furnace heat in ( and summer heat out ) . They cost little , and over the years pay back a big dividend both in comfort and actual fuel dollars saved .  | ALMOST every homeowner faithfully puts up storm windows and doors when the leaves begin to fall . That 's smart business ? keeps heat in the house and cuts the fuel bill . But many homeowners forget to calk around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lose lots of heat through gaps between the wall and the trim . Calking compound is an elastic material of a putty-like consistency . It is used to fill seams , cracks and joints in wood , masonry , metal , glass or any combination of those materials . You can buy it in several colors , the most common being white , gray and black . The white and gray are oil-base compounds , and you should use them where you want to paint over them . The black kind has an asphaltum base . Do n't paint over it , because the asphaltum will often bleed  | through the paint . The oil-base compound wo n't bleed through . Calking compounds usually are sold in two grades ? gun grade and knife grade . The gun grade is most common and is especially made for application with a calking gun . The knife grade is stiffer and is designed for application with a putty knife or small trowel . It is used for many jobs where the softer gun grade would not be suitable . It makes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putty . And if you use it rather than putty to fill cracks or nail holes in siding or trim , it will not crack out as the wood expands and contracts . Since it dries harder than the gun grade it is ideal for filling seams in exposed wooden floors ? such as porch floors . Calking guns vary considerably but work on the same principle . A plunger on the end of a rod rides in the barrel . A ratchet on one side of the rod is engaged by a pawl on the trigger . Pulling the trigger forces the rod and plunger into the barrel , squeezing compound out of the nozzle . Regardless of the type of gun you use , the basic techniques are the same . Pick a warm , dry day . Do n't calk when the tern- perature is lower than 55 ? F. or when the surface is the least bit damp . When the temperature is too low , the compound becomes too stiff to work properly . It wo n't dry and hold as it should . When painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't have to wait for calking compound to dry before painting over it . If you are doing a two-coat job , apply the first coat of paint . Let it dry , calk , and then go ahead with the finish coat . It 's best not to calk over raw wood . Prime it first . How to calk . If you find loading bulk compound is a messy- job , use a calking cartridge . This'is a cellophane tube with compound inside . You drop it in the barrel and snip the end off with scissors . You 'll notice that nozzles of the guns are beveled. fold the gun so the angle of the bevel is parallel with the joint to be calked . Pump the trigger once or twice until compound starts to ooze out of the nozzle . Move the gun slowly and steadily along the joint , squeezing the trigger as you go . As the ratchet clicks , release the trigger and start the slow , steady pressure on the trigger again . Keep the nozzle moving along evenly all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door frames and other openings . Scrape out all calking that is cracked , crumbling or loose . Remove calking that has shrunk so it is pulling away from the wall or frame . If you can slide a knife blade between calking and wall or frame , then the compound has started to pull away . After scraping out old calking , dust out the joint with an old paintbrush . If old calking is sticking firmly at the sides but has started to crack clown the center , then it is generally safe to re-calk over the old compound . Windows and doors . Calk completely around window frames . Also fill any joints in the frames that may have opened . If you have steel casement windows , calk all around them too . Then go inside and seal the joint where the steel frame and the plaster meet . Use the smaller 1/4 " round nozzle or the pinched nozzle for the inside job . Around door frames , carry the calking down to the spot where the frame meets the stoop . Also calk wherever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exterior walls . If these walls are wood siding , fill all cracks and seams , using the  | smaller round tip . If the walls are brick , fieldstone ; stucco or other masonry , use the round tip . Scrape out loose or cracked mortar and replace it with calking compound . Water that seeps into masonry joints may freeze and crack the masonry . Roofing and , lashings . Reload your gun with black , asphaltum-base compound for calking the roof . The black compound is best for roof jobs because it stands up better under exposure to the sun than the white or gray compound . Check around all chimney flashings , calking where necessary between the metal and the brick work and between the metal and the roof . Other spots on the roof that may need calking are around vent pipes and along the flashings in valleys . Also run a bead along the eaves where the shingles overhang . Wherever you have to fill wide joints ? such as on a flat roof covered with roofing felt ? use a putty knife or trowel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run any remaining compound out of the gun . Then disassemble the gun and wash all parts in mineral spirits . Use a piece of wire to clean the tips . Make sure the threads on the barrel and cap are clean . An old paintbrush is handy for washing the threads and the end of the plunger . When the parts are clean , assemble them and wrap the gun in a cloth . While ordinary compound and a calking gun can be used to seal joints in tile and cracks around a bathtub , there is a - plasticbase waterproof compound for this purpose now on the market . It comes in a tube and you apply it by squeezing the tube . It dries in four to six hours . MOST houses built in recent years have I- been at least partly insulated . A lot of older ones have n't been insulated at all . The chances are that , unless you live in a new , lavishly built house , additional insulation will improve your home . What to expect . Good insulation is like money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconsumed fuel . How much it pays is tough to figure in advance , depending as it does on a lot of variables . You should be realistic in estimating the probable savings . Do n't total up five different advertising claims and expect the fuel bill to dwindle to the vanishing point , like the character who bought so many gassaving gadgets he expected to bail out the tank of his car every ten miles . However , here 's what a full insulating job can do : A six-months ' test was recently run in Belleville , N. J. , on two identical two-story homes . One was fully insulated and the other only above the upper ceiling . Over the period of the test , it took 340 more gallons of fuel oil to heat the incompletely insulated one than it did the other . At 12 cents a gallon , that 's a six-months ' saving of $40.80 . Blowing it in . If the walls of your house were n't insulated when the house was built , and if you want to fill them , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His crew will arrive with a truck , big blower , long hoses and bags of insulation . They will remove sections of siding , cut holes in the sheathing , blow in the insulation , and seal up the wall . If you have a lot of time and energy you might do the job yourself , but it is laborious and tricky . One problem is locating the fire stops , the short , transverse two-by-fours between studs . To do it right , you should cut a hole just under each fire stop , and this calls for a lot of sounding and probing . Unless you are very ambitious , better not tackle a blowing-in job for an entire house . It is n't too hard , though , to do a limited area , say , a bathroom with one cold outside wall that makes the room a bit chilly for comfort . Insulation can be fed into wall holes with scoops bent up out of dustpans . Do n't forget that if you can couple the  | wall-insulating job with remodeling work , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an outside plastered wall is to be covered over with paneling or wallboard , it will be easier to forget the outside , siding-and-sheathing approach and just cut into the plaster at the ceiling and at the fire stops . Insulating the attic . Here the job is much simpler , and unless you 're very lazy . there 's no need to call in a pro . About the only tools you need are your hands , and the only cost is that of the insulation itself . Where the attic is not floored but has just walkways on the joists , it 's simply a matter of lugging the insulation upstairs and putting it between the joists . Bags of loose fill are bulky , and you may have some trouble getting them up narrow stairs or through a small hatchway . If there 's a fair-sized attic window , it 's often easier to rig up a pulley from the roof overhang and haul the stuff up . A plastered ceiling between the joists must be treated gently , of course , since it wo n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cleat together a platform of boards to stand on so that you can slide it along the joists as you work . Work with an old hat on because it is often a dusty job and you are also apt to konk yourself on the rafters . And if you put in loose mineral wool , work with gloves ? the material may irritate your hands . If the attic flooring is nailed down , you are n't necessarily prevented from putting  | insulation between the joists . Often the boards are really subflooring , put in carelessly and not thoroughly nailed to the joists . If that 's the case , it is n't much of a job to pry up six or eight boards , put in the insulation , replace the boards , and move on . Installing your insulation . If you use batts or blankets in your attic , lay them between joists and staple them between studs and rafters . Loose fill , of course , is poured . Reflective insulation should always be installed with an air space ? at least 4 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflective insulation is placed where its face touches another surface , it loses efficiency . The metal foil then conducts beat . Foil insulation can be stapled on the edges of framing members , but it 's better to staple it between them . Then if you later decide to finish your attic , you can nail up wallboard and the board wo n't touch the foil . When installing any insulation , remember to follow the maker 's directions closely . His insulation is made to be installed in certain ways . Follow his instructions and you 'll get the best results from your work . Ventilation . This is a must , especially for summer comfort . Keep the air moving out from under the ioof as it heats up and the heat wo n't have a chance to transfer to the rooms below . When you 're insulating between the rafters , start at one side where the rafters meet the joists . Do n't carry the insulation all the way to the roof peak . Run it across between the collar or tie beams and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louvers at each end of the attic . Place them as high up as you can get them . They must be above the collar beams and the insulation . While you 're about it , see to your storm sash and weather stripping . Neglecting these two safeguards is like locking the barn after the horse is gone . A lot of the heat saved by insulation and calking can be lost through loose-fitting windows and doors .  |
