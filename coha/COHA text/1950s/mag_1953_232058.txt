The big , hot , twin-jet Scorpion interceptor-shiningly fresh from Northrop Aircraft Co. ' s assembly line-looked like a purposeful insect as it edged out on to the runway at the Ontario ( Calif . ) International Airport . Few heads turned as it took off at exactly noon one day last week - it was being flown on a routine production test , as a preliminary to being delivered to the Air Force . But two minutes later the airport tower man strained to watch it ; the voice of the Scorpion 's pilot had just spoken eight chilling words from a loudspeaker at the field : " Get out the fire equipment . I 'm coming back . " <P> <P> The pilot-a dark , level-eyed Alabaman named Eugene W. Townsend - was one of the thousands of young men who were swept into the air by World War II . He seemed to have been born to fly ; he was a quiet , controlled fellow who moved with the easy grace of a natural athlete . As a Navy fighter pilot , he fought from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes , won the Navy Cross . But like thousands of other young military airmen , he had got away from airplanes fast after V-J day . <P> The Quiet Life . Gene and his wife , a tiny , dark-haired , brown-eyed girl , opened a little restaurant in Glendale , Calif. , prospered moderately , and settled down to savor the quiet life and raise a family . They had two children , Greg , now 3 , Robin , now 6 . " Townsend , " said his pastor , " was one of those sturdy , quietly happy men whom children instinctively love . When he came into the church with them on Sunday morning , it always made me feel good-any pastor with one family like that in his congregation has every reason to be happy . " <P> In the end , however , Gene decided that he had to fly again . Eighteen months ago he went to work for Northrop as a test pilot . He was a good one . <P> As his Scorpion came howling toward home , he quietly outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2 ) he had the fire under control , 3 ) the burning engine was delivering no thrust . In the next agonizing minute it became evident that he had other troubles . <P> " His flaps were still up , " said a mechanic who waited . " He was coming in awfully hot . He must have been doing at least 180 in the approach . " Though the plane 's hydraulic system seemed to have stopped functioning , Townsend finally got his wheels down , apparently by using compressed air from the emergency container . " But even with that much drag , " the mechanic noted , " she just would n't sit down . " <P> Another Try . The big , shiny interceptor skimmed along at terrific speed just above the east-west runway . At the halfway point , Townsend 's wheels seemed to touch-but only for a second . He said over the radio : " I 'm going to try another circle . " For half a mile the crippled Scorpion labored for altitude . The gamble failed . In one last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was bordered by houses , and for a tense second or so , as the plane settled , observers were certain that it would smash through them . Then Townsend nosed down . He had made his choice . The Scorpion crashed head on into a railroad embankment just short of the houses . Pilot Townsend , airborne for only five minutes , was dead when the fire trucks arrived .
