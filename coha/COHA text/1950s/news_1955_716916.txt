txt If two feuding men living on the same street decide that they had better try to co-exist it is not at - all necessary for them to go visiting one another . Neither is it necessary for one to show the other how he gardens or how his folks live at home . Indeed , there are some people who believe ft best to keep the feuders apart for fear that the quarrelling might start afresh and disturb the entire neighborhood . But there are others who believe that visits back and forth might lead to less misunderstanding and thus to a co-existence based on more than fear and back-fence threats . Now either of these results may occur when the fenders meet . But if word spreads through the neighborhood that Jones asked Smith over and Smith refused , one result will be certain . The neighbors will think Smith in the wrong no matter how right he may really be . For that reason we think the Government is wise in granting visas to eleven editors of Soviet student and youth publications to visit this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wise to accept Moscow 's recent offer for an exchange of farm delegations . That all of the visiting Russians will be carefully screened by Moscow is not to be questioned : they will come here indoctrinated in the blessings of Communism and steeped in scorn for the capitalist system . But they all have eyes , and while the words they utter here and say and write when they return home will be controlled , they still will have discerned ' some differences in the systems . And the very least they can learn is that Americans do n't have two heads and that some of them can milk a cow and plant some corn and perhaps do it as well as the Russians . None of this is to say that we ought to destroy our H-bomb piles , admit Red China to the U.N. , send all our soldiers home and capitulate to the Russians . But it is to say that if there is ever to be more than an uneasy co-existence between us and Russia it must be based on understanding . An exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not alone ease our relations with Russia . But there will be one less avenue to understanding if we insist that Russia keep lowered the Iron Curtain that Moscow is willing to lift a little .
