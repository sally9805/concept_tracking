Britain 's Sir Alan Patrick Herbert , quixotic wit and author , does not believe that all marriages are made in heaven . In his novel Holy Deadlock , he charged full tilt into Britain 's archaic divorce laws ; after he got into Parliament , he pushed through the Matrimonial Causes Act in 1937 , the first piece of divorce-reform legislation in 81 years . In the fight over that bill , some of Herbert 's most strenuous opposition came from a conservative faction in the Church of England . Last week they were at it again , this time on the issue of Anthony Eden 's remarriage . <P> The High Anglican Church Times had criticized " the marriage . . . of the Foreign Secretary , during the lifetime of his divorced wife , " and chided a " pagan generation " for taking it " as a matter of course " ( TIME , Aug. 25 ) . In its next issue , the weekly newspaper noted without surprise that its views had aroused a generally " hostile " reaction . <P> " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gospel is always a stumbling block and an offense . . . Marriage means one thing to those who recognize Our Lord 's authority . It means something quite different to those who do not . " <P> The long-wed " A.P . " snapped back with a peppery article in the Daily Express : " For 38 years I have given practical proof of my respect for ' Christian marriage ' . . . Most of us , I am sure , whether we recognize ' Our Lord 's authority ' or not , have the same ' ideal ' of marriage as the editor ... I hate to use the word ' humbug ' in any controversy ; but let me say that the Voice of the Church has behind it some very loose and inconsistent thinking . . . If a man divorces his first wife after five years ' ' incurable insanity , ' he would risk the displeasure of the Church Times on his second marriage . <P> " But if he ' put her away ' within a year by the way of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawful marriage to be null &; void because she was found to be subject to ' recurrent fits of insanity or epilepsy , ' he would be free to marry again at once , with not a word of reproach from Portugal Street the Church Times 's address . . . But where is ' Our Lord 's authority ' for this ? How dare such loose thinkers lecture decent people . . . on lack of ' principle ' ? <P> " It is one thing to regret divorce-I regret them all . It is quite another to say that good men and women , lawfully married a second time , are ' living in sin ' . . . Next time a respectable statesman who has had an unhappy life seeks comfort in a second marriage , I hope that Portugal Street will keep quiet about ' Our Lord 's authority . ' "
