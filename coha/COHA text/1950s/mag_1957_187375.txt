After a fortnight 's testimony on operations of the Teamsters Union in Tennessee , Arkansas ' seasoned John McClellan was fed up . Snapped the chill-eyed chairman of the Senate Labor Rackets Investigating Committee : * " I do not think even the committee was prepared for the shocking pattern of viciousness , lawlessness and disregard for the laws of the land to which many witnesses have testified here . " Sample testimony : Nashville Teamsters negotiated contracts with pile-driving fists ; Knoxville Teamsters dynamited truckers who refused to bargain without NLRB elections ; Chattanooga Teamsters bombed , burned and escaped the consequences by passing $20.000 in bribes that , by strong inference , influenced the decision of the county judge trying the case . <P> The judge was identified as gaunt , greying Judge Raulston Schoolfield , 51 , unsuccessful 1954 candidate for governor against Frank Clement and currently president of two separate Tennessee segregation societies . Six years ago 13 teamsters , including Chattanooga Local 515 's President Glenn W. Smith and Secretary-Treasurer Hubert L. Boling , were indicted for dynamiting and arson during organizing drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who carefully studied the evidence against them and decided it was " good . " In fact , testified former Court Officer James W. West , Judge Schoolfield " seemed enthused " at the prospect-possibly because earlier the Teamsters Union had opposed Schoolfield 's election as judge . <P> A Bit of Talk . But before the case came to trial , Local 515 cashed checks totaling $18,500 , marked down the money to " attorney fees . " Two days before trial , Tennessee Deputy Fire Marshal Raymond Hixon , who had gathered the arson evidence against the defendants , happened to meet Teamster Secretary-Treasurer Boling . Testified Hixon : " He told me that there was not going to be a trial . I asked him how he knew . He said that there had been $18,500 passed to quash the indictments , and there was not to be a trial . " Hixon remembered that at the time " there was quite a bit of talk around that money had been passed to quash the indictment . " ( Asked Committee Counsel Robert Kennedy : " Passed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The indictment was quashed , the 13 freed . Later , on an appeal by the prosecution , the state supreme court reversed Judge Schoolfield , ordered that the Teamsters be tried . Later also , according to Senate investigators , Local 515 chalked off another $1,500 to legal expenses . The 13 defendants were brought to new trial . This time they were freed for keeps . The legal mechanics : Judge Schoolfield ordered the jury to return a verdict of not guilty because the prosecution had failed to prove that the 13 Teamsters committed the violent acts involved .
