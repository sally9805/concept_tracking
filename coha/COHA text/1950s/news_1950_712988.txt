txt At its recent conference in Montevideo , the United Nations Subcommittee on Freedom of Information and the Press adopted a code of ethics whose first article begins with these two statements : All engaged in the gathering , transmission and dissemination of news and commenting thereon shall make the utmost endeavor to insure that the information the public receives is factually accurate and objective . Every item of information , - whenever open to doubt , shall be checked and no fact distorted or an essential fact suppressed . These are admirable maxims . But the correspondent who attempts conscientiously to live up to them frequently finds himself handicapped by a factor of which there is no mention here . This factor is government censorship . Let us consider , for example , the case of the correspondent whose news beat is Moscow . ( Our own correspondent there , now temporarily in this country on a visit , is one of a small and dwindling number of foreign correspondents in that city . ) The American reporter in Moscow makes , as the new U. N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insure that the information the public receives is factually accurate and objective . " But in a country  --  Russiawhere an autocratic government has an iron-fisted monopoly of all news , where there is no opposition party , no opposition press , no freedom of expression for the average citizen ? it is a task surpassing the ability of any reporter to determine in each instance what news is " factually accurate and objective . " He simply does the best he can . But he can not do what the U. N. code would have him do , and make certain that " every item of information , whenever open to doubt , shall be checked . " How can he " check " every item , and with whom ? Nor can he make sure , as the U. N. code advises , that " no fact " shall be " distorted " in his dispatches , or " an essential fact suppressed . " For when he has written his dispatch , with the best accuracy he can muster , in that blacked-out Russian world , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censor then strikes out arbitrarily half of what was originally a balanced report  --  thereby producing , on his own account , a very definite " distortion " of the news . Equally often , with a stroke of his blue pencil , the censor makes certain that some " essential fact " of Russian news is effectively " suppressed . " Considerations of this kind  --  considerations which frequently result in the presentation to our readers of a distorted or incomplete report from Russia , through no fault of our correspondent , and despite his best efforts to the contrary  --  have led us to weigh the wisdom of placing over the head - of all our dispatches from that country the warning , " Censored in Moscow . " Cur reason for failing to do , so is that this practice , which would be intended to prevent our readers from being misled , would in itself mislead them , in another respect , if we stopped at this point . For the fact is that while censorship is at its devastating worst in Russia , censorship also prevails elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , are subject to censorship . Dispatches from various Central American countries  --  the Dominican Republic , El Salvador , Guatemala . Honduras and Nicaragua  --  are subject to irregular or informal censorship . In still other countries , which are technically without censorship , official obstacles are put in the way of gathering news by foreign correspondents . Finally , there is the " self-censorship " imposed on the correspondent who knows that he is valueless to his newspaper or press association unless what he writes gets through to his home office , and who has been warned by experience to " censor " his own copy . How is news subject to all these varying degrees of censorship to be accurately labeled ? A more drastic alternative to the device of using the phrase " Censored in Moscow " would be to abandon the effort to get straight news from Russia and withdraw our correspondent entirely . This we would be reluctant to do , believing our readers will agree with us that at least some news from Russia , however badly truncated and distorted by censorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
