The Breaking Point ( Warner ) is the latest turn in the cinematic fortunes of Ernest Hemingway 's 1937 novel , To Have and Have Not . The Warners used the title in 1944 for a movie that launched the career of Lauren Bacall and pretty much let the Hemingway story alone . Then , in 1948 , they borrowed one of the novel 's episodes for the climax of Key Largo . At last the studio has made a film of the book itself . The result is an expert piece of hard-boiled cinema . <P> Producer Jerry ( Johnny Belinda ) Wald and Scripter Ranald MacDougall have taken plenty of liberties , but that should not offend Hemingway fans who recognize that To Have and Have Not is one of the master 's lesser works . The script reshuffles characters and incidents , creates new ones , even switches locales ( from the Florida keys and Cuba to the California coast and Mexico ) . In reshaping the novel , it softens some cutting edges . But the story is still tough , violent and essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individualist , desperately down on his luck . <P> Harry Morgan ( John Garfield ) , a rough &; ready veteran of PT boats , scrounges a living for his wife ( Phyllis Thaxter ) and two daughters by chartering his cruiser for fishing trips . Apart from his boat ( which is not paid up ) and a talent for spotting marlin half a mile off , he has nothing " to peddle but guts . " When a client runs out on his bill , leaving Morgan broke in a Mexican port , he starts peddling guts . <P> Through a crooked shyster ( Wallace Ford ) , he makes a deal with a smuggler to carry eight Chinese into the U.S. , runs into a double cross that forces him to kill the smuggler and dump his passengers onto a Mexican beach . Then Morgan 's troubles multiply until they drive him into a much riskier scheme : to pilot a getaway boat for four ruthless holdup men and kill them for the reward money before they can fulfill their plain intention of murdering him . <P> Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic , underplayed sequences of growing tension . Besides stinging melodrama , the film offers some unusual dividends . Its love story involves the hero with-of all people-his wife , and it is played with a passion that U.S. movies never seem to find in married couples who have school-age children . In the other woman ( Patricia Neal ) , who gets nowhere with Morgan , the script fashions an acid , quip-studded portrait of a smart tart on the make . <P> The Breaking Point sheds high credit on both sides of the camera . Much of its quality stems from Cinematographer Ted ( Treasure of Sierra Madre ) McCord 's fine photography of sun-baked waterfront and open sea . All the players are in top form . In his meatiest role in years , Actor Garfield gives one of his best performances , and Actress Thaxter is memorable as a housewife bowed down by drudgery , poverty and fear . <P> <P> Eye Witness ( Eagle Lion Classics ) sends a brassy U.S. defense lawyer to England on a tough murder case , and then watches him stumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plot is predictable , but Producer Joan Harrison and Director-Star Robert Montgomery wring some wry chuckles from their bull-in-the-china-shop situation , and keep the story moving at a lively clip .
