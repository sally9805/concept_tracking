 |p489  Lieutenant Colonel , United States Air Force HIGH over the cold , vast Arctic Ocean , the radar officer in a converted B-29 Superfortress droning toward the girth Pole stared unbelievingly into his scope . There , outlined against the characteristic pattern of the ice pack , was radar 's picture of land ? an island rising from deep sea where no land should be . Quickly the airman called the plane commander on the interphone and verified the position as 300 miles north of Point Barrow , Alaska . He sketched the discovery on his chart and marked the date ? August 14 , 1946 . I think this marked chart and accompanying report , turned in by the 72d Photo Reconnaissance Squadron at Ladd Air Force Base , Fairbanks , Alaska , should rank with the important documents of Arctic exploration . This young American had not discovered new land , as he believed . But he had provided a key which was to unlock one of the Far North 's old mysteries and give his country a valuable base closer to the Pole than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me personally , that key opened the door to a white world of scientific discovery and adventure . I was first commander of America 's northernmost outpost , and for a quarter of a year lived 150 miles and less from the very top of the world . " Land " That Moves with Arctic Winds After the B-29 's return other airmen roared over these northern wastes to confirm the existence of what was now termed " Target X. " They looked down on the robin's-egg blue of lakes , the steely glint of rushing streams , and a coast 20 to 40 feet high rising from the tumbled sea ice of the polar pack . Rocks , they reported , jutted from a windswept plain . Patches of earth showed darkly . In vain did the pack , destroyer of explorers ' ships , attack the island 's shores . Giant fragments piled under coastal cliffs attested the strength of this 200-square-mile mass . But , mysteriously , it was several miles from where it had first been plotted . There could be only one answer . Target X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights ? planes sent regularly over the North Pole by Air Weather Service to observe conditions there ? were alerted to watch for more ice islands . They found two other large ones drifting far from land in the central Arctic basin . Canadian flyers later discovered some 40 smaller fragments in the channels of their country 's Arctic archipelago . Gentle parallel swells , or waves of ice , from a few inches to 15 feet high and from 800 to 1,000 feet apart , crossed the islands ' relatively flat surfaces . Imperviousness to the battering of the pack suggested frozen fresh water , harder and stronger than salt ice . Thicknesses of 200 feet or more , 20 times that of the sea ice , were deduced from their height above sea level . Peary 's Explorations Give a Clue Somewhere along an Arctic shore a giant glacier must be spawning these immensities . But where was such a glacier ? Narratives of early explorers supplied an important clue . Lt. Pelham Aldrich , member of the British Arctic expedition headed by Sir George Nares in 1875-6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had seen a unique ice foot , or shelf , fast to Ellesmere Island 's north shore and extending far seaward . This was apparently a glacial remnant , part of the prehistoric ice that once covered Ellesmere and the surrounding sea as an icecap now covers the interior of Greenland ( page 494 ) . A puzzled Peary wrote a description of the shelf that perfectly fits today 's ice islands . Later we were to land on Ellesmere ourselves , and , by comparing corings , match islands to the glacial shelf still extending 10 miles to sea in places . It is thus still true that there are no icebergs in the Arctic Ocean ; bergs as we know them in the Atlantic break from " live , " moving glaciers when they reach the sea . Arctic ice islands , much older and larger , have split off from the dead Ellesmere shelf . The process must have been rapid since the turn of the century , for Peary described a far more extensive ice foot than now exists ? further evidence of a steady warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , the most interesting result of recent ice island studies is a possible solution to mysteries of " nevi lands " never seen again after " discovery . " Crocker Land , sighted by Peary in 1906 and marked on Arctic maps until Comdr . Donald B. MacMillan in 1914 disproved its existence , may well have been an ice island .  |p490  Fletcher 's Ice Island , a United States Air Force Station , Drifts Near the North Pole Born of an ancient glacier , this 150-foot-thick slab of fresh-water ice gave Americans a floating but stable platform to establish camp and make a leisurely study of the secrets of the inhospitable Arctic Ocean . Air Force planes like this parked C-47 had no great difficulty landing even before a runway was leveled . Tumbled salt-water pack ice , which discourages permanent stops at the top of the world , grinds at Fletcher 's far shore . Distant camp shelters scientists taking records of weather , ocean , and ice . Two tracked weasels dot the trail . So might Keenan Land , President 's Land , and Sannikov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Eskimo , Takpuk , and the crew of his sloop , landed there in 1931 , photographed it , and left still thinking it was land , but their photographs show an ice island . No discredit reflects upon the brave and experienced Arctic explorers of another day . Men of the Air Force , including that radarman , can testify that ice islands closely resemble land , particularly when the viewer is walking around on one on a summer day . Air Age Overcomes Ice Barrier Discovery , history , old mystery are one thing ; our Air Force missions of today and tomorrow another . What use could be made of ice islands in the Arctic , repository of vital secrets of ocean and weather ? For more than 2,000 years the unpredictable pack had denied man more than brief and hazardous visits to its domain . To this day , no ship can smash through it at will . Some have managed to buck and thread a way into the ice in summer . Winter locked them fast ; the fortunate ones came out again , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Long 's Jeannette was crushed in 1881 , a mishap which cost the gallant naval officer his life . In the same year Leigh Smith , an intrepid Arctic explorer , lost Eira , a specially built steam yacht . which sank in two hours . Some seven years earlier Tegetthoff , under Lts . Karl Weyprecht and Julius Payer of the Austrian military forces , was crushed and abandoned . The British have left many ships in the Arctic , among them the ill-fated Sir John Franklin 's Erebus and Terror . Other casualties are Karluk , used by Vilhjalmur Stefansson 's Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913-1918 , and the Russian icebreaker Chelyuskin , smashed in 1933.  |p491  Airmen Bundled Against Minus 20 ? Cold Survey Their Snowbound Domain in the Polar Sea Explorers may well have mistaken ice islands for land ; they inked Arctic charts with " discoveries , " only to have them vanish before the next man appeared . In 1946 the Air Force determined such objects were adrift , and in March , 1952 , a ski-footed C-47 left three Americans on island T-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them was the author , Lt. Col. Joseph O. Fletcher ( left ) , for whom the spot later was named . Lt. Col. Jack W. Streeton ( right ) was able to land this C-54 on wheels because a snow path had been smoothed . Sledges can move perilously across the pack , but they carry little . The men who first came by air had no stable platforms for their camps , supplies , and scientific instruments . But here , at last , in the form of ice islands , were the platforms . In January , 1952 , the Alaskan Air Command organized " Project Icicle . " Its mission was twofold : to establish on an ice island a weather-reporting station for Air Weather Service and a geophysical research base for Air Research and Development Command . I was placed in charge . A first consideration was selection of the island . Of the three in the polar sea , old Target X , now named T-1 , had drifted back home to Ellesmere . T-2 , which squarely crossed the geographical Pole , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , page 493 ) . We took T-3 , about a quarter the size of T-1 and slightly more rugged of surface ( pages 490 , 495 ) . By the time we were ready , it should be 120 miles from the Pole , although this was of no practical importance as long as the island stayed well at sea in an area where no weather data were being obtained . Preparations kept us at Ladd Field during January and February . Then we flew to Thule , in Greenland , an Air Force base so new that we pioneered the supply route from Alaska . Scouting an Icy Future Home On March 14 we judged it time to scout our island , unseen for three months . A flight of 975 miles brought our four-engined transport over it at 88 ? 17 ' N. , 166 ? 13 ' W. As nearly as we could judge , it had not changed a whit since it was photographed a year before . Only at the tips of the irregular ellipse were the island 's ice ridges too high for safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring a ski-equipped C-47 , grand old twinengined work horse of the armed forces , down onto the packed snow surface of T-3.  |p492  Saw and Shovel Build a House of Snow Blocks to Shut Out Icy Winds Copying the Eskimo , Fletcher 's Island settlers worked without lumber or nails . When snow walls melted in summer , the men put up empty fuel drums in their place . Hard blue glacier ice formed floors , and tarpaulins made roofs . When this airman finished the hut , he tunneled a passage to the canvas-covered house in the rear . Snowshoes ( jammed into the snow ) enabled him to cross drifts ( page 499 ) . Our firsthand view of this enormous slab of glacier majestically grinding its way over the roof of the world gave substance to hours of briefing , discussing , and training . An enthusiastic party returned to Thule . Once more we reviewed our plan . Clear weather and good light would be essential for the landing . With Maj. Gordon F. Bradburn , who would command the three aircraft we planned to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 19 we would go , just before the spring solstice when the sun would again return to the Arctic from its long winter sojourn in more southerly latitudes . At 8 o'clock of the appointed morning the heavily laden planes thundered off the runway into the crisp air . We were on our way at last . Only our C-47 was to land . Two of the three men it would leave on the ice were working passengers . To save weight , Capt. , now Maj. , Marion F. Brinegar , known to colleagues in the 10th Air Rescue Squadron as " Ice-pack Mike " because of his prowess as an Arctic camper , doubled as second navigator . I w radio operator . Dr. Kaare Rodahl , physic ' and research physiologist from the Air Force Arctic Aeromedical Laboratory at Ladd , no flying duties . General Flies as Copilot Capt . Lewis Erhart flew the ship . Characteristically , Maj. Gen. William D. Old , head .. f the Alaskan Air Command , had decided that he would allow no one under his orders take risks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copilot . One of our two four-engined planes ( C-54s ) , with Capt . Edmund G. Smith at the controls . was to fly ahead . " Smitty , " as we called this son of the South , would find T-3 , the : :  |p493  Island Lost in Arctic Twilight It surprised no one , but nevertheless added to the mounting tension , when Smith was unable immediately to find T-3 . Then , strikingly incongruous in these parts , came an Arkansas drawl in my earphones . " Over T-3 , " said Smitty . " Good ! " broke in Bradburn from the other C-54 . " How does it look ? " " Cold , " reported Smitty , " and there 's nobody there . " In less than two hours that lack was remedied , and routinely enough . First , smoke bombs out the door to get wind direction . Next , circles at 300 feet while Erhart picked his spot . Then came the sensation of sudden slowing that showed flaps were down , a few tentative touches with the skis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of landing . For a moment after the ship skidded to a stop no one moved , affected by the realization that at last we had reached our objective . Then we piled out in an eager rush . My first impression was of cold striking with chilling force even though the wind was a mere 10 miles an hour . We estimated the temperature to be minus 50 ? F. My next reaction was apprehension : General Old was prepared to order us back into the air if our survival appeared doubtful . He looked around and grimly shook his head . " I do n't see how anybody could live here . Better get out ? if we can , " he said . Following him back along the plane 's tracks , I agreed that landing in the snow with heavy aircraft bringing equipment would be difficult , but pointed out we had made plans for dropping almost everything by parachute . " We 'd feel awfully bad to leave now , " I said to the general . " How do you know the others want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my companions had given me when we walked off over the snow .

T-1 , the initial discovery , swept a 1,600-mile course , then ran aground off Ellesmere . T-2 directly crossed the Pole . Traveling about two miles a day , T-3 ( Fletcher 's Ice Island ) has backed and filled , circled and pushed along a 2,400-mile path . The only island manned , T-3 saw its first airborne pioneers in 1952 . They came from Thule , Air Force base in Greenland .  |p499  " All right , " capitulated the general . " I guess , if we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags were set out in the snow to mark a drop zone ; on it the planes circling above parachuted fuel for the C-47 and supplies for us . Erhart and General Old maneuvered the ship into take-off position . A final good-by and it was off , hurled into the air by four JATO ( jetassisted take-off ) units . The sound of engines died in the distance . We three were alone . Knowing that raging arctic gales could shriek down with scant warning , we set about digging in . Our first shelter was a double-walled mountain tent , regulation government issue , with tarpaulin floor . We banked the outside with snow . Inside , we wriggled into two-piece GI " mummy bags , " over which we drew larger sleeping bags , keeping our arms free . Not until then did we start dinner . Like many Arctic travelers before us , we had trouble lighting the primus stove , partly because of our cold clumsiness and partly because the kerosene fuel showed a tendency to solidify . However , we managed a first meal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already in bed , we drifted after dinner into sleep interrupted by sharp sounds , like the popping of pistol fire , caused by the cracking of ice in the extreme cold . We found that the shooting gallery shut down as soon as the weather became a trifle warmer . Exploration began in earnest the next morning . The first discovery was that the dry snow , of sandlike consistency , was a few inches deep along the ridges , three feet in the wave troughs . Feet shod only in Eskimo mukluks went through the surface crust , leaving us floundering . We put on snowshoes . Carrying rifles and a portable two-way radio , we headed for the sea ice at the island 's edge . It took us two hours to cover two miles , with frequent stops to thaw frostbitten noses and cheeks . This was to be our coldest day , much colder than when we had landed . Vapor trails appeared high in the sky . The walkie-talkie soon put us in prearranged touch with a Ptarmigan flight , and we assured its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep in Touch This and later contacts with Ptarmigan planes brought us more than official messages . Dr. Rodahl received word from the sky that he had become a father . The foresighted scientist rummaged in his luggage and came up with the traditional box of cigars . For me in particular there was reassuring warmth in the sight of sturdy ships overhead and the sound of friendly voices on the radiophone . I had commanded this fine Arctic flying unit , the 58th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron ( Weather ) , for the two years Frozen Breath Whitens Mustache and Beard Maj. Marion F. Brinegar , one of Fletcher 's Island 's first settlers , looks out from a regulation Air Force arctic flying parka trimmed with Alaskan wolf fur . He wears long woolen underwear , sweater , and flying suit beneath the parka . Four pairs of wool socks , felt slippers , and mukluks protect his feet .

Soderberg , had been my operations officer and my next-door neighbor at Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks . Never had I found him wanting ; it was good to know he was still near , ready and able to help if help was needed . As the ship overhead passed on , we continued our first ice island exploration . From the vantage point of a 40-foot ice peak on the shore , we looked out over the pack . It was a wild panorama ? grotesque white ridges as far as the eye could see , one large lead of open water in the distance , immense blocks of ice lying in 30-foot-high masses . " How would you like to drive a dog team over that ? " I asked Kaare and Mike , thinking of the indomitable explorers of yesteryear . " I 'll take the airplane , " said Rodahl . Sight of the frigid chaos , in which anything wearing a white fur coat could easily escape detection , brought up the subject of polar bears . Dr. Fridtjof Nansen had met them above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been deliberately attacked by a hungry bear . Dr. Nansen commanded the specially built Norwegian ship Fram , purposely frozen into the pack toward the end of the last century . She drifted across the Arctic , becoming the outstanding exception to the rule that ships can not survive the grip of the pack . During our stay on the island we never saw a bear , nor a fox , whale , seal , or other living creature larger than a sea bird . But a few days after our first venture afield , we did find large bear tracks and signs of fox close beside our trail . Such evidence is soon drifted over by wind-driven snow . In the warmer months small translucent shrimp were abundant in leads near the island . Those who manned T-3 after my return to the United States in June found the remains of what appeared to be a lemming , and of fish on the glacial surface after the snow and some six inches of island itself had melted off . Arctic " Whiteout " Shrouds Island A pair of caribou horns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caribou was still frozen below them , but excavation was postponed until the summer of 1953 ( page 503 ) . Many explorations followed the first one . Soon we met the Arctic " whiteout . " Wrote Admiral Peary , describing the conquest of the Pole in the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE for October , 1909 : . . . we experienced that condition , frequent over these ice fields , of a hazy atmosphere in which the light is equal everywhere . @# All relief is destroyed , and it is impossible to see for any distance . " It was an apt description . We found that when thick clouds obscured the sun no shadows were cast to reveal hummocks , drifts , and depressions in the snow . Everywhere there was only whiteness . We stumbled into drifts and tumbled into holes . In the whiteout , a man out of sight of camp would be hopelessly lost without a compass . Small , dark objects were visible at a surprising distance and often appeared many times their actual size . Population Jumps Two-thirds April 1 , thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The C-47 returned , carrying geophysicist Albert P. Crary , of the Air Force Cambridge Research Center , and Capt . Paul L. Green , communications officer . They brought our permanent radio station , the first of the weather and geophysical equipment , and replenishments for the larder . Camp by now consisted of two 12-footsquare tarpaulin-roofed huts of snow blocks and two tents . The second tent became our kitchen , complete with oil stove . One hut was a storeroom . The other , connected to the first by a tunnel , was intended for emergency shelter , but we moved into it bag and baggage the day after the first real storm . The island acquired a name . Newcomers carried written orders from Alaskan Air Command sending them to " Fletcher 's Ice Island . ' ' Crary had a neatly lettered sign to go over the door to headquarters . We said a fond good-by to Dr. Rodahl and a few days later , with the arrival of Robert D. Cotell and First Lt. Robert R. Danner , we saw Mike Brinegar off . Officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? Crary , his assistant Cotell , Green , Danner , and me . During the next three months we worked long and hard . Many with whom I have talked since my return to the United States were skeptical when I told them we never found time heavy on our hands , were never bored . There was always plenty of work to do ; and we never had time to become irritated with one another 's constant proximity . Rank disbelief often greets my assertion that after the first few weeks we were very comfortable . Our supplies ? clothing , equipment , food ? were the best . Our permanent station had everything we needed . One of three insulated huts 16 feet square . flown to the island in sections and assembled on hard blue ice scraped clean of snow , became a combined kitchen and assembly room . It had a modern oil range , washing machine with drier , fluorescent lights , electric food  |p501  U.S. Air force , official Americans Stand on the North Pole for the Second Time in History This Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral Peary weeks of weary sledge travel .

Crary ( fourth from left ) and Robert D. Cotell ( standing , right ) . Lt. Col. William P. Benedict ( insignia on cap ) piloted their plane . mixer , phonograph , and comfortable furniture . A second hut was sleeping quarters ; the third , our all-important laboratory . In it were weather station , radio , and geophysical equipment . Captain Green broadcast important weather data every six hours . Between broadcasts he talked to radio hams all over the world . Offhand , I can recall conversations with people in Japan , Scotland , and Nairobi , Kenya . When conditions were good , amateurs in the United States helped complete telephone calls to our families . Scientific instruments were calibrated and repaired at a compact workbench in a corner . Instruments within and without the shack measured atmospheric pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun regularly for observations of terrestrial position so we could determine movement of our island and the pack . Because of the rotation of the earth , our frozen home appeared to drift about 40 ? to the right of wind direction , and at about 1/45 of the wind 's speed . Main cause of the island 's movement is wind ; consequently it was an erratic traveler , but it averaged one-and-ahalf or two miles a day . We found no clear trace of sea currents , except those induced near the surface by the wind . The little known Arctic Ocean on which we floated was the special province of Crary and  |p502  Air Explorers Cross Admiral Peary 's Sledge Trail on Ellesmere Island Admiral Peary fixed the date of his arrival at Cape Columbia as June 8 , 1906 . Other members of a subsequent Peary expedition erected the marker in 1909 . Flying from Fletcher 's Island , the author ( left ) . Colonel Benedict , and First Lt. Herbert C. Thompson ( background ) landed to investigate strange objects on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Danish Adm . Godfred Hansen in 1919 . Cotell , who set up hydrographic equipment on the thin sea ice . They measured temperatures and salinity at various depths . Up to the time we moved onto the island , depths had been measured at only a few places in this vast sea . We took scores of soundings , using seismic equipment . Although the bottom was generally flat and more than 12,000 feet down , here and there mountains rose to within 7,000 feet of the surface . Submarine Grand Canyon Discovered Crary discovered a giant submarine canyon ; altogether T-3 drifted seven times over its sheer precipice , which was more than 4,000 feet high . Samples of the bottom were brought up ; plankton was strained out of sea water from many depths . Fresh water was plentiful . All we needed to do was locate a subsurface lake , a pocket of crystal-clear water trapped in our glacier , and dig down to it . During the cold period , we noticed that we developed a craving for fatty foods . Two of the versatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown in . They were kept in a garage of snow blocks , in which we also set up the electric-generating plant . Heat from the generator kept the weasel engines warm , so they started easily . With them we smoothed a landing strip . One day we had visitors from the Navy . Out of the polar sky dropped two planes of its Ski-Jump II project , which is devoted primarily to oceanographic research . One had engine trouble ; its crew stayed with us three weeks while a new engine was flown in by the 54th Troop Carrier Squadron .  |p503  Summer Thaws Bare a Caribou 's Antlers .

This was an Air Force mission , and several of us from Fletcher 's Ice Island went along . It was entirely successful , thanks primarily to the fact that our drifting base , with all its facilities and comforts , by then lay about 100 miles from the Pole ( page 501 ) . We flew to T-1 , and to Ellesmere and its glacial shelf . Flying over bleak Cape Columbia , we saw a marker of some sort and a crude tripod below ( opposite ) . Landing , we found a signpost left by a Peary party in 1909 and - led runners projecting from a cairn built in 1919 by the Danish explorer Adm . Godfred Hansen . In June the temperature on the ice island climbed to freezing and above . Bright blue lakes formed in hollows . Draining them , small streams rushed pell-mell to the sea , cutting tunnels and miniature canyons ( page 498 ) . Snow-block walls melted but were replaced with empty fuel drums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on the ice sank beneath the surface . Instead of reflecting the sun 's heat back into the atmosphere , as did the ice on which they lay , they absorbed it . Thus warmed , they melted the ice beneath them and dropped into tiny wells of their own making . This familiar phenomenon came in handy for playing jokes on visitors . We told them the holes were ice-worm burrows . To lend credence to the tale , we froze spaghetti into ice cubes served at table and apologized profusely to our aghast visitors for our " careless " kitchen inspection . Late in June came orders for Cotell , Green , 504 The National Gec  |p504  and me to leave . We went reluctantly , replaced by an augmented crew with still more equipment for probing sea , ice , and sky . As this is written , Fletcher 's Ice Island is still inhabited , and valuable work goes on . Ways in which temperatures of ice and atmosphere affect each other are being studied . Gauges set between salt-water ice and island measure the terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and broadcasts continue every six hours . Instruments now go far aloft on balloons . Equipment used to track their course was successfully flown in . Clues to Mysterious Jet Stream In Washington , D. C. , Air Weather Service meteorologists search reports from Fletcher 's Island for clues to the general circulation of the earth 's atmosphere . Such information may help to explain the existence of the jet stream , the mysterious , undulating current of air that travels at high speed far above the earth . Knowledge of jet-stream positions often enables airmen to ride tail winds , cutting hours from long trips . Generally our island home proved itself directionally stable . It had no recognizable bow or stern , of course , but its inhabitants aligned it with true north by means of markers arbitrarily established on the ice . Twice , for unknown reasons , the island made partial rotations in a clockwise direction , turning the first time through 50 ? and the second through 80 ? . These rotations were slow , the 80 ? turn requiring nearly a month . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second of arc , showed that the island tilted a small , varying amount . This was ascribed primarily to wind , but sometimes the levels were thrown into confusion by localized surface upheavals caused apparently by internal pressures . Also products of pressures from within the island mass were strange " ice bumps . " These domelike protuberances occurred on the tops of ridges near the shores and were occasionally three feet high . Coring bits were driven down 52 feet . Within this distance 54 distinct layers of dirt were encountered . Mostly mineral matter , they also contained a few bits of twigs and leaves . The presence of the dirt was accounted for in several ways . Boulders and large earth mounds were terminal moraines left by tongues of glaciers which thrust out on the Ellesmerefast shelf , then retreated . Summer streams coursing down from the land left silt and small pebbles . Some fine layers may have arrived as atmospheric dust . The boulders were conspicuous features of the landscape . Some were big , weighing many tons and measuring as much as 10 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . as if a careless giant had tried to build a stone wall . A few of the smaller ones were shipped to the United States for study . A reliable estimate of the island 's thickness was made . Charges of TNT sent shock waves . which travel at known speeds , through the ice . Measuring the elapsed time , Crary and Cotell reported that our camp rested on a 150-foot-thick block of ice , a cold , inert mass as thick as a 14-story building is tall . The figure indicated that the original 200-foot estimate for T-1 might have been a bit high . To measure movements of the pack with relation to the ice island , our scientists triangulated on several big sea-ice hummocks . One day the most conspicuous of these toppled over with a roar . A persistent " warm " layer of ocean was discovered 400 feet below the sea 's surface . Less than 150 feet thick , it averaged about 2 warmer than the water above and below it . There was no satisfactory explanation for its presence . Survey parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp began taking its fresh water from two lakes found beneath four to eight feet of ice . Freezing on all sides subjected these water pockets to pressure : when first tapped they spouted in gushers . Passing sea birds were identified tentatively as gulls and jaegers . Nobody had time for hunting , nor for hiking two miles over the pack to the nearest open water where it might be possible for large marine animals , such as seals and narwhals , to come up for air . Tinter darkness made it necessary to light the landing field , now provided with two runways . A complete portable lighting system was delivered by parachute . Men Toil Through Long Polar Night An oceanographer , a marine biologist , and two geophysicists are among the nine men who have toiled ceaselessly through the Arctic 's long winter night , adding constantly t.our knowledge of one of the least understood regions on earth .

Latest reports indicate that the ice island is beginning a second polar swing ? good new for the Air Force , since it would mean another five or six years of useful service for T-3 . If it does go around again , many of its former residents would like to go along .
