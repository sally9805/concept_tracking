txt Labor Day has come about because , seventyseven years ago , Peter J. , president of the New York Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners , proposed a day " which shall be labor 's "  --  a day for a parade " to show the strength and esprit de corps of the trade and labor organizations . " The idea caught on and spread fast across the country . Labor Day is now a legal holiday in every state . Today , here in New York City , a hundred thousand labor unionists are expected to march up Fifth Avenue  --  and not just to show their esprit de corps . The placards they carry will tell the world that this is a mobilization against what " labor " believes to be " a cold war deliberately invoked against the whole trade union movement by the big business interests of the nation , " as President Meany of the A. F. L.-C . L 0 . has put it in his Labor Day message . Few people in this country , outside the ranks of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is well for the public to be objectively informed of them , and of the reasons for them , because their results may well be profound . However one-sided the charge may be , labor leaders contend that this " anti-union war " is evidenced by the refusal of the steel companies to consider any increase in wages that will add to the costs of doing business and by their insistence on changes in the established working rules to reduce labor costs . The same position is being taken by an increasing number of firms in collective-bargaining negotiations . Labor leaders also charge that the McClellan committee exposure of corruption in a few unions has been used by " business interests " in an unprecedented lobbying and pressure operation to force through Congress a bill in the guise of " labor reform " which was really designed to cripple " legitimate " union operations . And labor 's anger has been heightened by frustration over the failure of the liberal Democrats in Congress ? whom labor helped elect  --  to defeat the-final version of the labor bill . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the months ahead . The steel strike may prove to be not an isolated battle but one used to rally all the forces of organized labor for this and other battles to come . Today has been proclaimed by the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . as " Support the Steelworkers Day " for its 13.5 million members to demonstrate " their complete solidarity with the embattled steel workers . " And a program will be launched at the federation convention for a strike fund to start with $25 million . Another major conflict is looming in the railroad industry when the present labor agreements contract runs out , Nov. 1 . Management will fight hard to eliminate contract-entrenched and allegedly wasteful work practices . As the authoritative Industrial Relations News points out , " the featherbedding issue is taking on the dimensions of a full-scale labor-management war . Company after company is seeking * * * to gain more freedom in setting performance standards and making job assignments . " The pressure to do this will , of course , be immensely increased by the fast-striding advance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near future be confined to the economic field . Labor 's disappointment over the liberals ' performance in Congress has already led to plans for intensified political pressures , both in elections and in lobbying operations . All in all , the labor forecast for the months to come must be : stormy with temperatures higher . Navigation will call for cool heads and a firm resolution by all concerned to steer a course directed toward the interests of the nation as a whole .
