txt President Eisenhower said today that the bottom of the business slump was close att hand , if it had not already been reached . At his news conference the President referred to many factors indicating the trend of the economy and concluded : " My own feeling is we are going through the worst of it right now . " In Cleveland , the National Machine Tool Builders Association reported that new orders for the metal-cutting tools , considered an important index , amounted to $22,850,000 in February , against $19,300,000 in January and $18,650,000 in December . No Tax Decision Now The President 's replies to a series of questions indicated that there would be no serious ' consideration of tax reduction until mid-April , when all the economic indexes for March would be available . In a letter to House Speaker Sam Rayburn later in the day , President Eisenhower asked for legislation authorizing the immediate use of $840,000,000 to place orders for equipment and material for the nonmilitary Federal establishment . The amount is one-half the total requested for the purpose in the fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000 , - , 000 would be spent in the next three months . Sees Impact on Jobs An additional $500,000,000 ofl the obligational authority requested would be committed by June 30 in procurement contracts . This would enable factories to retain their full labor , force in many instances and to ' recall laid-off workers in others . A White House statement on the President 's request said " these actions should have a widespread and immediate impact upon business activity and employment . " . President Eisenhower did not enumerate all of the " factors " that prompted his conclusion that the bottom of the recession might already have been reached . Neither did he foreclose the possibility of a general tax cut if such action seemed warranted after a review of economic conditions in mid-April . Only the " strength of con-1 // sumer buying power " was mentioned specifically by the President as an indicator of the direction of the economic trend . But on the subject of taxes and the possibility of their reduction , his emphasis was on the folly of precipitate action . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " seriousness of large and continuing deficits , upon our whole fiscal and financial system . " He indicated that there was every reason to expect a deficit for the current fiscal year and the next one beginning July 1 that would be larger than original budget estimates had reflected . Notes Tax Agreement . General Eisenhower reminded the conference that he had tried to be entirely accurate in what he had'said on the subject of a tax reduction , and that he had never excluded it as a possibility should such action " seem desirable . " At the same time , he said , the legislative leaders ? both Republican and Democratic ? had viewed the possibility with such gravity that they had agreed that they would not be " stampeded into doing it . " The President said the seriousness of such a step was reflected by the agreement between the Congressional leaders and Robert B. Anderson , Secretary of the Treasury , to do nothing about a tax cut except after bipartisan consultation or at least notification of intention . Stressing again the need for ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We have got to be very , very careful of what we are doing to this economy over the years as well as just looking at the mediate difficulties in which we find ourselves . " Otherwise , he explained , the nation might easily make a difficult situation even worse . The President for the first time used the term " frantic " to describe the attitudes of those who had embraced the idea of tax reductions as a cure-all for the business slump . He said it was the same frame of mind with which some people approached the subject of earth satellites and that it might easily lead to doing the wrong thing . Having declined an invitation to say whether any cut in present excise taxes should be made retroactive , the President said that he would not discuss any such proposal until he believed there was a necessity for taking action on it in the first place . General Eisenhower then ventured into what was for him an lunexplorat field . It was his belief , he paid , that the American people should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of the product that is offered to ' them " instead of trying to predict the effeet on prices of some possible future action by the Government . The President had been told Iby a questioner that many people were reportedly postponing automobile purchases to see whether there would be a cut in excise taxes . After saying that people should " buy now , " General Eisenhower expressed the view that there was a great field for expansion of business by better salesmanship on the part of business concerns . He said a big backlog of savings might yet be tapped if business concerns would offer their products in better packaging . Better advertising also would help , he declared . On another aspect of the economic slump , price-depressing farm surpluses , the President agreed ' with a questioner 's suggestion that something should be done to prevent hunger in the face of accumulations of staple commodities . However , it was his position that the solution was not to be found in the Brannan plan , which would pay farmers the difference between whatever the products would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing a parity of the purchasing power of agricultural and industrial workers . Cities States Rights Neither did it follow , the President suggested , that because people were going hungry or had improper diets the Federal Government had to provide a remedy " right square here from Washington . " The rights and responsibilities of the states had to be considered , he said . President Eisenhower appeared alert and vigorous as he responded readily to the wide range of questions . With his press secretary , James C. Hagerty , the President walked across the street from his office in a light drizzle . He was hatless and wore no top coat . The $840,000,000 of obligational authority for Federal procurement asked by the President reflected an overnight increase of $240,000,000 over the figure announced by the White House yesterday . While his proposal would not change the total volume of Government purchases of everything from heavy road equipment to typewriters and pencils , it would alter the timing of such purchases . The acceleration of orders contemplated would be in addition to the speed-up of defense contracting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
