txt WASHINGTON , Aug. 10 ? The Atomic Energy Commission and the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council praised today the report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation . The A. E. C. found it a " thoroughgoing scientific study . " It noted particularly that the study had pointed out that there was no certainty that fall-out would produce new cases of leukemia and bone cancer . Likewise , the commission called attention to the report 's estimates that the genetic effects of fall-out would constitute only a small frac= tion of probable effects caused by natural radiation . The commission has consist // ently taken the point of view that radioactive fall-out from the present intensity of nuclear test . explosions did not have the great danger to the present and future health of humanity that some have ' ascribed to it . Notable among the latter has been Dr. Linus Pauling , Nobel prize winning biochemist of the California Institute of Technology . He has contended that fall-out from tests would cause 200.000 children in each of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. E. C. Disputed Senator Clinton P. Anderson , vice chairman of the Joint ConLeressional Committee on Atomic ergy , remarked that the United Nations report destroyed ' some of the " pet theories " held by the Atomic Energy Commission . The New Mexico Democrat said that the report was at variance with the commission 's " stiffnecked attitude " on testing . He said that the commission had always advocated unlimited testing . Mr. Anderson , in remarks filmed for television . ' said he ' had taken a position with those who believed that " what we should try to do is limit the amount of fission products put into the atmosphere each year . " He said , however , that " we do need to test for the present . " The statement for the National Academy of Sciences , an independent Federal agency , was made by Dr. Detlev W. Bronk , the president . He said : " The United Nations has performed a most valuable service by bringing together the scientists of many nations to pool their knowledge in this field and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be undertaken . " Both ? Dr. Bronk and the A. E. C. said they were gratified that the United Nations , report generally had confirmed the independent report of the Academy Research Council of two yeah ago . THE . A. E. C. STATEMENT The text of the A. E. C. statement follows : The report of the United Nations Scientific Committee is a thorough-going scientific study of the whole subject of the effects of atomic radiation . It generally confirms the statement in the June . 1956 , report of the United States National Academy of Sciences with respect to the possible hazards from radiation exposures from both man-made and natural sources of radiation . It reiterates that ail unnecessary exposure to atomic radiation should be avoided . The committee has made estimates of the possible effects of fall-out radiation in causing leukemia , bone cancer and major genetic defects . It is important to note that in so far as leukemia and bone cancer are concerned , the committee has pointed out there is no certainty that fall-out will produce any additional cases of either disease . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to estimate the greatest number of cases which might result from fall-out under the most pessimistic assumptions . The estimates for genetic effects caused by fall-out would constitute a small fraction of probable effects caused by natural radiation . Role of U. S. Noted The Publication of the committee 's report is especially gratifying to the Atomic Energy Commission since this committee of scientists had its genesis in proposals made by the United States . In urging the establishment of the committee , the proposition set forth by the United States Representative in the Tenth General Assembly was that . " by disseminating our present knowledge and by gaining additional knowledge we can free ourselves from fear of the unknown . " To this end , many members of the United Nations have contributed reports on radiation and its biological effects . The United States over the past several years has developed the greatest proportion of the documentation now available on radioactive fallout and has been the largest single contributor of information received by the committee . As is the case with every technological advance , man must learn to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him . The Atomic Energy Commission is pleased to note the committee belief that radiation problems need not bar increasing peaceful use of ntfelear energy . On this matter of such vital significance , the report states that , " In the light of general scientific experience , the committee confidently expects that continuing research on an increasing scale will furnish the knowledge urgently needed to master those risks which we know to be associated with the development and scope of the uses of nuclear energy for the welfare of mankind . " The Atomic Energy Commission appreciates the effort that the committee put into the task of dealing with the many uncertainties in our present knowledge . The report states that . " any present attempt to evaluate the effects of sources of radiation to which the world population is exposed can produce only tentative estimates with wide margins of uncertainty . " The Atomic Energy Commission concurs in the committee 's recommendations for further intensive study in many fields to narrow these uncertainties .               @ @ @ @ @ @
