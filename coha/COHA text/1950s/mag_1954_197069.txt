For years our citizens between the ages of 18 and 21 have , in time of peril , been summoned to fight for America . They should participate in the political process that produces this fateful summons . <P> - Dwight D. Eisenhower 's State of the Union Message , 1954 . <P> The U.S. Senate last week voted 34 to 24 in favor of the amendment that would add to the nation 's electorate 6,200,000 youths between 18 and 21 . But the vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed . The 24 Senators who blocked the amendment were all Democrats , many of them Southerners , who based their opposition mainly on the principle of states ' rights . <P> The Constitution vests in state legislatures the power to set the qualifications of voters in federal as well as in state elections . This power has been curtailed by constitutional amendment : in 1870 the 15th Amendment gave the vote to Negroes and in 1920 the 19th Amendment gave the vote to women . Unlike discrimination against a race or sex , the question of minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to confront the Senators with a compelling issue of democratic justice . <P> Senator Richard Brevard Russell , whose native Georgia is the only state where 18-year-olds already have the vote , led the anti-amendment attack . Said Russell : " I think that permitting all those attaining the age of 18 to vote in my state has worked very well . . . but I do not propose to vote to coerce any other state of the Union to follow the example of my state . Neither do I propose to vote for an amendment which would put my state in a straitjacket . " <P> Although the amendment failed , Dwight Eisenhower could take satisfaction in a rare display of solidarity by his party : not a single Republican vote was cast against him . <P> Also last week in Congress : <P> The Senate Banking and Currency Committee agreed on an intricate housing bill incorporating portions , but not all , of the President 's housing program ( see BUSINESS ) . <P> The Senate passed , 73 to 3 , a bill to ban shipments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The Senate passed a $5.7 billion money bill for independent Government agencies ( e.g. , Veterans Administration , TVA , Atomic Energy Commission ) , $287 million less than the Administration 's request , but $135 million more than the House had voted . <P> The House cleared for the President a money bill giving $3,332,732,700 to the Treasury and Post Office Departments , $6,050,300 less than the Administration 's request . <P> The House Appropriations Committee voted to increase each Congressman 's office expense allowances ( for stationery , postage , clerks ' salaries , etc. ) by $5,551 a year . Total cost : $2.414,710.
