txt WASHINGTON , March 2 ? A merry President Eisenhower scoffed today at suggestions he was " an indispensable man " to a Republican victory in 1956 . Smiling and chuckling , the President had a gond time skillfully evading a series of questions by reporters seeking to draw him out on whether he would be a candidate for reelection . 1 At one point , he agreed at a later date to discuss both sides of the question of whether In should run again  --  but only if the reporters meanwhile would give him a complete moratorium on the subject . He suggested the subject not be raised again until one year from today . The reporters attacked the Presidential secrecy from a variety of angles . In reply , they received meaningful , if contra ( 3.ictory , hints . Some of these suggested he would run again , others indicated he would not . The most direct question recalled the statement of Senator Barry Goldwater , Republican of Arizona who is chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee . The Senator said that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Eisenhower should be the candidate . The President replied quickly with this : " Did you ever think of what a fate civilization would suffer if there was such a thing as an indispensable man ? When he went the way of all flesh , what would happen ? It would be a calamity , would n't it ? I do n't think we need to fear that . " Vice President Richard M. Nixon was quoted . in the next effort to draw out the President . A reporter recalled that the Vice President had said in Puerto Rico yesterday that he hoped the President would seek re-election . President Eisenhower was asked if he wished to send any message 1. o Mr. Nixon . Feigning disbelief , the President leaned forward to ask " did he say that ? " Assured that he had the President said he had great admiration for the Vice President as a splendid type of the younger man desired in Government . " On the comment he made , I will send him no special message . " the President added amid laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him when I see him . " Joshed on San Francisco Reporters thought maybe they had something when the President said that he had favored San Francisco over Chicago for the 1956 Republican National Convention because San Fran-1 cisco had a better climate . Did this reference to climate , he was asked , mean that it could be taken for granted that he would attend the convention ? " No , " the President exploded amid laughter . Then it was recalled that the President some weeks ago put off a question on his 1956 plans by saying that he would discuss the " pros and cons " at some future conference when he had plenty of time . " Could we make a date with you , sir , to get that at the next press conference ? " The President joined in the laughter that followed , then replied : " I would doubt at the next press conference . But I will tell you , if we can have a complete moratorium on it , I might make a date , let 's say , a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a year 's respite from questions about this future political plans . He probably will be asked about them at the next news conference . But from General Eisenhower 's point of view , there is much in political history to sup-loft the contention that a President in office should not indicate too early whether he would run again . Timing Would Be Good Early in March , 1956 , would be a good time for General Eisenhower to make his intentions known . If he wishes to run , he will , of course , have no difficulty obtaining renomination by his own party . If he does not , that will give other nominees time to make their own candidacies known in a series of Presidential preferential primaries , beginning in New Hampshire on March 13 . In. the meantime , politicians argue , the President 's hold on his own party in Congress would be weakened greatly if he were to announce he would not seek re-election . Other candidates would be /n the field for themselves , seeking to make a record without regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
