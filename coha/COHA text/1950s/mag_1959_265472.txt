After his off-the-record chat with State Representative Steve Dolley one day last week , Reporter Paul Crooke of North Carolina 's daily Gastonia Gazette ( circ. 20,491 ) tossed a memo on the crowded desk of Managing Editor Bob Hallman . Gist of the memo : Dolley , a onetime Gazette staffer , was only pleasing officials of nearby Bessemer City when he introduced a bill to reorganize their courts , had " no desire that the bill pass , " was convinced that " it has no chance whatever " - and wanted the Gazette to kill any stories about it . Somehow , in the deadline shuffle , the memo got mixed up with the copy , acquired a straight-faced head ( BILL <P> WOULD EXTEND COURT AT BESSEMER ) , and was printed verbatim on page 2 of the Gazette . " It was a note that came up at press time , when there was no one around . " moaned beet-red Editor Hallman , " and . . . and ... it was just one of those things . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
