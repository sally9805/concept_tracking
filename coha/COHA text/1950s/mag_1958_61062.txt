On a cold , rainy November morning in 1921 a small crowd gathered to watch Gwenda Hawkes , a slight , intense young Englishwoman , confidently straddle a curious two-wheeled American machine called a Ner-a-car , which belied its pretensions to close relationship with the automobile by its appearance . At best it was a mere motorized scooter . It ran on all of one cylinder and its only means of stopping was a single rear-wheel brake . Under official scrutiny in daily runs of 190 miles , Mrs. Hawkes miraculously survived 1,000 grueling miles on the fragile machine over icy roads without a spill or breakdown . And although the failure of the Ner-a-car to attract British customers was no fault of Mrs. Hawkes , there is no doubt that any asset it may have had was overshadowed by this amazing performance . // This was precisely the kind of challenge Mrs. Hawkes ( whose name in those days was Stewart ) liked best . It was unusual , a little mad , and it was equal to anything any man had ever performed on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too , it was an endurance record of its kind ; and a record in Mrs. Hawkes 's lexicon was something that was either to be established or shattered  --  preferably by herself . Her ability to do both is now racing history . // Some of Mrs. Hawkes 's records stand today ; the five-mile and 10-mile ( at 140.17 mph and 138.34 mph ) , set in a Derby-Miller at France 's Montlh ? ry track in 1933 and 1934 . Others were only recently broken . Her 10-and 50-mile records ( at 105 mph and 104.5 mph ) , set in an 1,100 cc . Morgan Three-Wheeler in 1931 , were not topped until 1954 . In the following year her record run on the Morgan for five miles , flying start , at 110.5 mph , finally gave way . And in 1956 her remaining Morgan record , set at Montlh ? ry for 100 miles , standing start , at 102 mph , was broken by the daredevil Murit on a BMW motorcycle and sidecar . Men , in each case , broke her records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawkes preferred , the motorcycle , a machine of great prestige at the time . A year after the Ner-a-car episode , she rode a 2 ? - hp Trump-J.A.P. continuously around England 's two-mile Brooklands track for 24 hours at an average speed of 44.65 mph . The time was clocked in two periods of 12 hours because the Brooklands neighbors complained vigorously about the noise when racing went on through the night . This was the first time a mark of the kind had been set . Considering that Brooklands has always been a rough track and motorcycles of the day were not blessed with hydraulic shock absorbers , the feat is remarkable . At sundown on the second day , a crowd assembled to welcome Mrs. Hawkes as she rode beneath Members ' Bridge . She was lifted off the machine and carried off on the shoulders of a cheering and appreciative mob . // In 1925 she again distinguished herself , this time at the Montlh ? ry track , with the assistance of racing enthusiast Colonel R. N. Stewart , at the time her husband and partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet , she dropped the clutch on a 346 cc . Rudge motorcycle and streaked off down the straightaway averaging one minute 40 seconds to the lap for two exhausting hours . She then turned into the pits , where Stewart refueled and took the handle bars himself for a two-hour spin . They rode two hours on and two hours off until shortly after 10 o'clock the next morning . By this time they had set a new track record at Montlh ? ry , had broken 21 long-distance motorcycle records and all marks in their class . // In search of still more adventure , Mrs. Hawkes turned to automobiles in the beginning of the ' 30s . On a day in December 1930 she brought glory to the Derby-Miller with a record for 10 miles , standing start , at 137 mph . She achieved this startling performance in a relatively tiny car ( 2,000 cc , two-thirds the size of a Chevy 6 ) . The previous record holder had been Leon Duray , an American , behind the wheel of a Packard . Indianapolis drivers today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track are considered far superior . // Five years later at Brooklands Mrs. Hawkes became the first woman to circle the track at more than 130 mph . In 1936 , in one of her rare appearances in a race , she teamed with George Duller in a Duesenberg at Brooklands and took an incredible seventh place in the British Racing Drivers 500 , an event which is in all respects as torturous and demanding as the U.S. 's own Indianapolis " 500. " // Despite these successes , for the most part Mrs. Hawkes shunned public competition . She preferred to race records rather than drivers . Records to her were cold facts , with no regard to sex . They could be challenged alone on the track . // Daughter of Major General Sir Frederic Manley Glubb , who so distinguished himself in World War I that he was promoted in the field , and sister of Glubb Pasha of the Arab Legion , a world-famous adventurer , Mrs. Hawkes was encouraged , and perhaps challenged , by her family background . She herself drove an ambulance during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. George and the Cross of St. Stanislaus . And yet this was little compensation for a girl who desperately wanted to triumph over man-made goals . // Never renowned for her beauty  --  as was her nearest competitor , Kay Petre  --  Gwenda Janson Stewart Hawkes nevertheless married three times , and always to men who shared her love for any machine on wheels . Her first husband , an army colonel named Janson , was with the Spyker auto company . Colonel Stewart was the managing director of Trump Motorcycles ; her present husband , Douglas Hawkes , besides being a designer and engineer of some note , drove in the Indianapolis " 500 " and the tough Tourist Trophy . // RETREAT TO GAUL // The Hawkeses settled for many years in France , a country that takes its motoring seriously and where Mrs. Hawkes 's reputation is well established . Living in a comfortable bungalow so near the Montlh ? ry track that the roar of the motors could always be heard , they set up a small factory to produce the front-wheel-drive Derby sports car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she began a lonely day 's work , gradually gathered speed and then actually beat the lap record at an average of 145.94 mph . A month later she made a sensational run pushing the car up to 147.67 mph for a new Montlh ? ry lap record . When this record was finally broken , it was exceeded by less than one mile per hour in a car half again as large . A man , of course , broke the record . // During World War II the Hawkeses confined themselves to the business of pistons and valves . With the war over , they turned from racing motorcycles and automobiles to yachting . They bought a yawl , Elpis , which they immediately accepted as a challenge . In search of the same kind of perfection with sails as they had achieved with motors , the Hawkeses sail the Mediterranean . But there is a difference these days . A mellowed Gwenda Hawkes is no longer in stern competition with men . And her boat is real  --  not one of your fly-by-night Ner-a-boats.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
