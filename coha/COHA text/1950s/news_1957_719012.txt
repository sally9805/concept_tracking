txt On July 24 a sweeping reorganization of the British Army was announced , reducing the Army by 51 major units and many more smaller ones , and preparing to cut it in half within five years . On the same day the text was released of a letter from Soviet Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin to Prime Minister Harold Macmillan . The letter contained scathing doubts about Britain 's intention . or even its wish , to bring about an agreement on disarmaments . The two events formed a single ironic comment on the unbridged gap of understanding that still yawns between the nations of the West and the Communist East . Last Resort ' Weapon The greatest difference between the great powers is over the question of the control and use of nuclear weapons . The Soviet Union will not agree to international control of production of these unless there is an outright ban upon their use in any circumstances , even in de-lease . Western governments , particularly those of Western Europe , can not yet give up the one unanswerable weapon of last resort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by vastly superior land armies whenever those wanted or were ordered to roll . The tendency of the Western powers meanwhile to disarm themselves of their orthodox arms , out of sheer economic necessity , drives this division between Western and Eastern understanding ever deeper . The more the West disarms the more it needs the security of the nuclear defensive weapon and the less likely does it become that the West can agree to the outright ban so adamantly demanded by the Soviet Union . If there was any doubt , however , about the actual desire and intention of the West to disarm , the government white paper explaining the reorganization of the Army surely ought to remove it . So much is to be cut away . Even tradition . Regiments to Merge Thirty famous regiments are to be merged into 15 . Joined to other regiments that remain intact these new 15 are to be grouped into .14 brigades  --  and it is hoped that the loyalty to " the regiment " on which the pride . morale , and even discipline of the British Army has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformed into a new loyalty to " the brigade . " Old badges famous in a hundred battles , shining with polish and the glow of honors , will simply fade away . A whole lot of new and unfamiliar badges will have to be designed . The famous Buffs ( Royal East Kent Regiment ) are going to merge with the Queen 's Own Royal West Kent and become  --  what ? The Seaforth Highlanders combine with their rivals , the Queen 's Own Cameron High-1 landers ? how will they be known now ? All this so that in a new mod-1 el army the total strength will be 160,000 men , all of them regulars . It is hoped that the striking head " will be kept strong while the " administrative tail " is reduced . Retirement Seale Set . Tax free grants of up to ? 8,760 ( $24,328 ) in compensation plus pensions ranging from ? 500 to ? 920 a year are to be paid to retired officers . Sergeants and petty officers get grants of , 121,500 and pensions of up to C230 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-believe disarmament . And it certainly explains the British attitude that the stopping of nuclear tests must be conditional on the settlement of other disarmament questions . Of this attitude Marshal Bulganin in his letter to Mr. Macmillan writes : " We are forming the impression that the British Government is bringing about a state of affairs in which the accumulation and perfecting of the most lethal and destructive means of warfare continues under cover of endless talks . Except for this rather . harsh remark the tone of Marshal Bulganin 's letter is relatively moderate , even where it reflects the deep mistrust of Western Mien-lions that the Soviets can not seem to dismiss from their thoughts . And it does that all the time . The Marshal again talks of expanding Anglo-Soviet trade and extending cultural exchanges without managing to say anything new . In fact , official British reaction is that both the tone and content of the letter are disappointing . They show no sign that Soviet leaders are beginning to seek a factual rather than a fanciful interpretation of the world around them .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
