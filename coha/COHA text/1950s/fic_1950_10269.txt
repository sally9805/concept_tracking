" But I was really glad to see them ! I liked all your friends , Roger , ever and ever so much . " " Truly ? Not just the ushers and the rest of my old crowd ? Of course , you knew them already . But the juniors in the firm  --  could you get any idea what they were like , seeing them so hurriedly ? " " Of course I could . I 'll describe them to you . Then you 'll know I 'm not pretending . " She locked her fingers a little more firmly in his and went on , " David Salomont was almost the first person who came down the line . He did n't look a bit as I 'd expected . " " What did you expect ? " " Oh  --  spectacles and a pasty complexion and rather oily hair . And I thought he 'd be either undersized or a good deal too fat  --  sort of pudgy . And that his Phi Beta Kappa key would be in great evidence on a flashy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a thoroughly obnoxious-looking crea- ture ! What a relief it must have been to discover how mistaken you were ! " " It was . I thought he was very arresting . And very  --  very virile . There is such a word , is n't there ? " Roger laughed again . " There certainly is  --  also such a quality . Yes , David has it all right . And arresting describes him too . 1 can see how you 'd remember him . He does stand out in a crowd , not just because of his size or his good looks or his wonderful clothes either . " " No . . . . And he 's also got an exceptional voice . I noticed that right away too . I should think he could do almost anything he wanted with it . " " He can and does . He 's a born spellbinder . It does n't matter much what he says , because he says anything and everything so darned well . I 'll never be able to argue cases the way he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his happy voice . Emily tightened the clasp of her fingers again and leaned over to kiss him . " Of course you will . Or if you are n't , you 'll do something else better than he does . He might make the mistake of being a little too forceful and insistent . That does n't appeal to everyone . It does n't especially appeal to me . " " Does n't it really ? " " No . And I thought of it when he came back in the line a second time . He made me feel as if he were determined to talk with me . I was glad to . because I do think he 's very attractive  --  very intriguing . But there were lots of other people I had to talk to and he did n't seem to be taking them into consideration at all . And somehow , I was glad I 'd thanked him for his wedding present right away and that I 'd remembered exactly what it was  --  you know , the punch set in the scroll design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I was pleased with it if I had n't men- tioned it first , but still I had a queer feeling that he might . " " All right , that 'll do for Dave . What about Brian ? " " Well , I did n't like him quite so much . He is n't forceful ; he 's almostimpudent . Of course , he was n't impudent to me . I do n't mean that . But I felt he could be . I thought he was a little crude . He drank a good deal of champagne . Then he went over to the window and shouted to one of the policemen he caught sight of outside  --  evidently a crony of his , and afterwardI overheard him making two or three jokes that were  --  well , they were n't nice at all . I 'm not used to men that make jokes like that . " " But you said you liked all my new friends ! " " I did . I do . But I like them in different ways . I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if it had n't been that I fell in love with you before I ever met him , I 'm sure I 'd have fallen in love with Pellegrino de Lucca at first sight ! " It was her turn to laugh , joyously and spontaneously , as if she knew Roger would understand how silly it was to suppose for one moment that she could possibly have fallen in love with anyone but him . He smiled pleasantly and kissed her again , but he did not laugh with her , and after a little she went on again in the same light and lilting way that she had spoken a moment earlier . " Besides , I had the funniest feeling this was n't the first time I 'd ever seen him . Do you think I could have possibly met him anywhere else ? " " No , I 'm almost certain you could n't have . Pell 's really poor . I 'm sure everything he had on was hired for the occasion and that even renting clothes cost more than he could afford . Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better fixed than he 'd admit . But Pell lives somewhere on the north side of the Hill and never talks about his family or asks anyone to come and see him . He does n't go much of anywhere himself , either . I was surprised that he came today . " And I 'm afraid he was sorry he did , Roger added mentally . Pell ca n't forge ahead for himself the way Dave and Brian can . He was a lot more hurt than they were at being treated like an outsider . " I 'm glad he did come though , are n't you ? " Emily said quickly , again divining his unspoken thought . " Because I think there 's really something very fine about him . How did Mr. Cutter happen to run across him ? " " I have n't the slightest idea . " Emily gathered he had talked as much as he cared to about the juniors and tactfully changed the subject , telling him how remarkably well she thought Caroline had looked in her maid of honor 's dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger answered her gratefully , but guardedly . He had been deeply touched because she asked Caroline to be her maid of honor , instead of some younger and more attractive girl , and he had tried to tell her so several times already , only to feel that he did so inadequately . Unless he frankly admitted his sister 's lack of charm , he could not express his sense of his obligation and hers to his fiancee . Well , Emily was not his fiancee any longer ; they were married at last , and he should be able to speak to her without reservation on the subject of Caroline or on any other . But suddenly he felt very tired and did not wantto talk at all . It had been hard work , keeping up with the endless requirementsof the office during the same period that he was expected to attend the innumerable parties given in Emily 's honor . Very often he had been obliged to sit up all night in order to do both , though he had never told her so . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he had not been able to forget that , in order to give it , he had been obliged to sell certain securities . And he had already sold others in order to buy Emily the right ring . There had been absolutely no way to manage the pearl necklace . She had been sweet about it , saying she would much rather have the pendant that had belonged to his mother , which he gave her instead ; but he knew she should have had the pendant and the pearls too . And he knew that the maid of honor and the bridesmaids should have had much larger bouquets , and that those carried by the flower girls would have had a much quainter touch if he had gone to a better florist . He knew that Emily had told the truth when she said she would really rather carry just a white prayer hook , with flowered streamers attached ; she was not thinking of expense when she told him so . But if she had wanted a great spray of white orchids instead , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was again , this hideous question of money , raising itself to torment him even on his wedding day . his starting salary with Cutter , Mills and Swan had been fixed at fifteen hundred dollars a year and this was more , he learned , than the other juniors , who had been taken on earlier in the Depression , had been given to begin with ; his first raise gave him an extra three hundred and his Christmas bonus had come to one hundred dollars more ; meanwhile , his annual income from his father 's estate was a little less than two thousand . If a well-to-do uncle , who had hitherto shown himself very stingy , had not unexpectedly come forward with the startling suggestion that he wanted to give the young couple their trip abroad for a wedding present , they would have been almost forced to accept Elizabeth Forbes ' offer of her remodeled farmhouse for a honeymoonhome . Roger could have brought himself to accept this hospitality , which would have involved very little outlay on anyone 's part ; but Emily liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger never could have spent large sums in travel for which the money was supplied wholly by his bride . During the final days of their engagement , when he and Emily were taking one of their frequent walks together , he had steered her in the direction of Joy Street and paused before the house which he had already eyed surreptitiously several times since the Christmas Eve when he had first seen it . The " For Sale " sign was still in the window and , as Emily did not immediately notice this , he called it to her attention and , for a few moments , they talked in a desultory way about the potentialities of the house . A week or so later , she telephoned him and asked if he would go with her to see it the following Sunday . Their inspection of it revealed an42interior which fulfilled the promise of his imagination ; but , after the ubiquitous agent , who insisted on accompanying them to every nook and corner of it , casually mentioned its " bargain price , " Roger recoiled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in the first place ; it was doubtful whether his life earnings would equal the cost of purchasing , renovating and maintaining this house . He never spoke of it to Emily again and she did not mention it to him either . Reluctantly , he suggested the Cambridge apartment as a temporary abiding place " while they looked around " ; and Emily had agreed , rather vaguely for her , but still very pleasantly , that this arrangement would be all right " unless they unexpectedly found something better " ; at all events , she did not think they should spoil their wonderful summer abroad by worrying about what they were going to do next . The question had not been reopenedand neither had any definite provision been made for Caroline ; it was understood that she and Marion Swan had " plans " for some joint undertaking which might mean a general readjustment in her design for living . Homer Lathrop had , of course , talked to Roger about Emily 's financial status and Roger still winced at the memory of this conversation . Unsparingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he viewed a matrimonial venture where the wife supplied most of the money ; he said he had tried to make Emily understand the grave disadvantages of such a union . Since she did not seem able to grasp these , he had reluctantly given his consent to an allowance from the trust fund which would prelude her from being noticeably shabby , or going hungry , or working her fingers to the bone . Homer Lathrop did not divulge the sum which he thought would do this , and Roger was too proud and by that time too wretched to ask ; his only thought was to bring the humiliating interview to an end and , when he went to see Emily that night , it was with the purpose of telling her that he thought he should release her from her engagement , though this was already announced , that he could not inflict a life of want upon her or endure one of almstaking for himself . But she had received him so confidently and so lovingly  --  she had shown him with such pride the engagementpresents which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy about the beautiful wedding they were to have  --  that he had not been able to speak the words which would have chilled her happiness and separated him from her , perhaps forever . Well , no one could separate them now , in spite of her family 's oppositionand his own misgivings . ' With the last words of the marriage service , his antagonists had been forced to accept him irrevocably ; they could not contend against him when he had become one of them . And when he had actually made Emily his wife , his own sense of unworthiness and inadequacywould be engulfed in one of triumph . Without realizing it , he was thinking in terms of security and vindication rather than in terms of rapture. 43In the days before their marriage , he and Emily had sometimes sat quietly side by side for long periods , so content in the communion of their minds and spirits that they needed neither words nor caresses to complete their consciousness of harmony . It did not seem strange to him that they should do so now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train sped on its way through the twilight ; after the turmoil of their wedding day , before the ecstasies of their wedding night , this silence , this deepening dusk , were balm to his weariness . Emily , sensitive to his mood , did not break in upon it ; she was not tired herself , but she understoodhis exhaustion . He had benefited as much as she from the hard-won victory on that distant Christmas Eve , but still it had been hers rather than his ; and she knew that the fruits of it , at all times sweet to her , had sometimes been bitter for him to swallow . Frequently she had feared he could not continue to do so . Moreover , he had not been sustained by the exhilaration which had never lessened , for her , since she learned that Old Mrs. Forbes was her ally . She had known from that moment that she and her grandmother were somehow kindred spirits ; but she had also known that the elderly woman and the young man misprized each other and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his feeling in the matter ; but she was so close to him that , without words , she had divined his antipathy . Old Mrs. Forbes had expressed hers with her usual brutal frankness one cool afternoon late in May when she and Emily were sitting by the fire together . " Of course , I 've nothing against that Field boy , " she told Emily . " He 's agreeable , he 's intelligent , he 's well born and well educated , he 's got good principles  --  in short , he 's a gentleman . You 'd think , to hear your father and mother and Homer Lathrop run on , that he 'd broken every one of the Ten Commandments and that the popular Seventh was quite possibly his favorite . I do n't believe he ever broke even a piece of bric-a-brac . That 's the trouble  --  it is n't what he 's done or may do that worries me ; it 's what he has n't done and never will do . " " That does n't worry me at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't . And I 'm not trying to make you worry . You say you want your life to be peaceful and pleasant and safe . Well , I think it will be pleasant and peaceful and safe with Roger and I think you 'll be reasonablyhappy with him too  --  as long as you do n't want the world set on fire and as long as someone does n't set it on fire for you , whether you think you want it aflame or not . Right now , you imagine you 're in love with Roger Field and  --  " " Of course I 'm in love with Roger . " Emily did not hesitate to say it to herself or anyone else now . She said it proudly and confidently . " My dear , if you had been , in the sense I mean it , you never would have voluntarily gone off to Kentucky and postponed your marriage for over a year , to prove your point . You 'd have eloped , in the face of family opposition , within a week after Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison , but falling in love is something like having labor pains . You can have false pains ' and you can imagine you 're in love . But when the real labor pains begin , you know the difference right away ; you do n't see how you ever could have thought you were suffering before . I ought to know  --  I 've had six children . And it 's the same with falling in love . I ought to know about that too . " " You did n't fall in love six times , did you , Grandmamma ? " Emily inquiredwhimsically . " Never you mind . I may tell you about that some other time  --  when I think you 're better qualified to understand what I 'm talking about than you are now . And you need n't joke about it either . It 's no laughing matter . Because , unfortunately , there 's no way of telling which is the real thing and which is n't until you 've had a chance to make the comparison . " " Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why have you made it easier for me to marry him ? " " Because I knew you had to get this pseudo love affair out of your system . If you had n't , there 's no telling what might have happened . You 'd have gone on and on building it up into a shining tower . And when it toppled over with a crash , it would have hurt you terribly . As it is , f think it may be just what you need , in the way of preparation . " " Preparation for what ? " " For life . Real life . Life in a world that is on fire . Your private world . Maybe everyone 's world . You have n't had any preparation so far . If there ever was a girl who needed to learn by experience , it 's you . I think Roger can help you to get it , without hurting you too much in the process . In fact , I 'm afraid he may not hurt you quite enough for your own good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean just one thing by that either . But some other man will come along who has n't the least idea of being considerate , in any way . He 'll want you and sooner or later he 'll try to get you . But not as soon as you 'll want him to . Because , that time , the pain will be real . " Old Mrs. Forbes leaned over from her thronelike chair and patted her granddaughter 's cheek . Then , even more surprisingly , she bent still further and kissed her . " Do n't be angry with me for telling you all this , Emily , " she said with a gentleness that came as another shock . " And do n't take anything I 've said to mean I do n't like that Field boy . I like him very much . In fact , I ca n't think of anyone I 'd rather trust you to . I do n't want you to be hurt . I only think you 'll have to be someday  --  in childbirth and in love too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll feel , in the end , that the agony was worth while in both cases . . . . Now , let 's talk about something else . What about that house on Joy Street you dragged me out to see ? Would you like to have it for a wedding present ? If you would , I 'll buy it for you and have it all ready for you to move into when you get back from Europe . Only , do n't tell Roger . Let 's keep it for our secret andgive him a nice surprise , shall we ? And of course Homer Lathrop 's got to give you more than three thousand a year to run it on . I never heard such nonsense in all my life . That would n't pay for your clothes  --  at least , it should n't . There , there , my dear ! " Unwillingly , Emily 's mind kept reverting to this conversation as she sat silently in the dark beside Roger , while the train sped on toward New York . At last , determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by name and pressed his hand . He did not answer her or return her caress and , after a moment , she realized that he had fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion . Then , afraid that her least movement would disturb him , she sat still more quietly , thinking about the house on Joy Street and wondering where it was that she had seen Pellegrino de Lucca before her wedding day . Part TwoJUNE , 1938 , TO NOVEMBER , 1938ROGER AND DAVIDChapter 5As FAR BACK as she could remember , Emily had gone to Europe every other summer , and she had also spent several winters on the Continent , in schools which encouraged their pupils to take trips during the Christmasand Easter holidays and assisted them in making their excursions illuminating and enjoyable . During the course of their long friendship , Roger had mentioned to her his own lack of opportunities for travel ; but it was naturally not a subject on which he cared to enlarge and his brief , reluctant references to it had slipped Emily 's mind . When he told her about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Europeanhoneymoon possible , the intensity of his pleasure was so evident that she tardily realized how greatly he had missed the advantages which she had taken for granted . " It 's wonderful , darling , wonderful , " she said . " I 'll write your uncle tonight , the minute you 've gone , and tell him how much I appreciate what he 's doing for us  --  if I write immediately , like that , he 'll know I 'm not just being polite , that I 'm really delighted . Let 's see  --  you say you do n't have to go back to work at the office till the Tuesday after Labor Day . That means we can have two whole months abroad , besides the time we 're at sea , if we go on the new Norrnandie . Why , we can do a lot in that length of time ! And Roger , what would you think of taking my new car , so that we can be perfectly independent ? I mean , about traveling wherever we like , whenever we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris from Le Havre on the boat train ; we could work our way slowly down through the Norman towns and along the coast of Brittany to La Vendee and Le Bordelais and then to Auch or Avignon . Afterward , we could go on to either Italy or Spain , whichever we 'd prefer . We could  --  " She stopped , aware that she was saying the wrong thing . Roger had not interrupted her , but she could tell , from his expression , that he did not want to go roaming around the Continent in her car ; he wanted to feel that all the facilities for this trip were furnished , directly or indirectly , by him . Moreover , he did not want to seek out remote exotic places of which he had hardly heard ; he wanted to take the beaten track which had long49since ceased to enthrall her , because it was so familiar to her , but which he had vainly yearned , for years , to follow , so that he might have the same easy acquaintance with good old Anglo-Saxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mistake to her grand- mother . " I smoothed it over right away , " she said . " I do n't think I hurt his feelings  --  not really . I said of course that what I 'd suggested was just one way of spending our time-that there were lots of other ways and that we 'd have fun , planning itineraries and then discarding them for better ones . I got the atlas and asked Roger to map out an entirely different kind of a trip . " " Very sensible of you , Emily . And I suppose his plan was to take a Cunarder , because he 's always heard Cunarders have such a wonderful record of reliability . Then , of course , you 'd go straight to London , and after you 'd been to the Tower and Westminster Abbey and the British Museum , he thought you might do a little touring  --  say to Stratford-on- Avon and Oxford and two or three of the cathedral towns . And that after- ward you 'd go to the Scottish Lakes , via Edinburgh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  such an excellent train , always on time to the minute . " " How did you guess , Grandmamma ? " " If I 'd never had anything harder than that to figure out , I certainly would have had an easy life  --  and a very dull one . Roger was n't thinking in terms of Honfleur and Quimper and Carcassonne and Urbino and Burgos  --  and you were . But you 'll be very wise for more reasons than one to take the route Roger 's mapped out  --  this time . Places do n't really matter very much anyway to a girl when she 's on her honeymoon . It 's the man that counts . " " That 's the way I feel about it , " Emily said contentedly . " So we 're sailing on a Cunarder and we 're going to stay at Brown 's Hotel in Lon- don . And we 're leaving my car behind . " In answering her grandmother , Emily had focused her attention on the old lady 's final remark ; but later , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Her honeymoon was a very happy one ; and it was not until Roger himself confessed , after several exceptionally grim and gloomy days in Glasgow , that he would welcome a change from Brussels sprouts and drizzly weather , that Emily realized ttxese had begun to pall on her too . By then , there was not time enough left to do much on the Continent ; but a rapid change of plan enabled them to have a whirl in Paris and an interlude of sheer enchantment at Ravello before taking the Vulcania home ; and it was while they were stretched out , at ease , in the sunlit privacy of the little verandah leading off their cabin , that Emily told Roger the secret she had kept so well until then . " I 've got a wonderful surprise for you , darling . We do n't have to bother50Caroline or start a more or less hopeless search for an apartment . We 've got a house of our own . " " A house of our own ! What are you talking about ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on Joy Street you liked . Grandmamma 's giving it to us for a wedding present . She 's been having it fixed up for us while we 've been gone  --  that is , she 's been having basic improvements made , like a better heating system and more plumbing . Nothing in the way of interior decorating  --  she 's left that to us , so we could suit our own tastes . But we 're to send all the bills to her . And stay in her house while we supervise the final papering and painting and that sort of thing . She 's going to stay late at Manchester- by-the-Sea this fall , so we 'll be by ourselves on Louisburg Square . " " Emily , you must be joking . It could n't be true . It 's too  --  it 's too  --  " He was unable to go on . Emily moved closer to him and put her arms around him . " It is true . I would n't joke about a thing like that . It 's all right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really mean something to us . Oh , Roger , we 've been awfully happy this summer , have n't we ? It 's been perfect  --  in its way . But after all , it was just a prelude to our real life together . Now we 're going to have that  --  on Joy Street . And it 'll get better and better all the time . " He held her to his heart , believing her . Nothing marred the pleasurable excitement of their return or disturbed the serenity of their stay on Louisburg Square . Roger resumed his work at the office with zeal and enthusiasm and , from the very first , Emily took immense pride and pleasure in her own house and devoted herself , with intelligence and industry , to its organization and embellishment . Every evening , when Roger came home , he found that she had made it a degree more livable and attractive than it had been the day before . Fresh frilled curtains appeared in the bedrooms and richer draperies on the ground floor ; the well-rubbed mahogany in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the library furniture was arranged and rearranged until it was placed in the way most conducive to complete comfort . And one afternoon Emily led her husband to the spacious linen closet and , throwing open its double doors , revealed pile after pile of snowy sheets and pillowcases and towels , gartered with satin-covered elastic to insure perfect regularity , and scented with small bags of lavender nestling between each pile . Roger felt such manifestations of housewifery delightful and found con- vincing ways of showing his appreciation to Emily . But secretly , he was even more pleased with the tact and consideration she showed by con- sulting him about all matters in which he might logically take as much interest as she did . During the years which Old Mrs. Forbes had spent in foreign courts , she had accumulated such " numerous treasure " that even51the immensity of the house on Louisburg Square would not hold it all , especially as it had not been permitted to displace family heirlooms . Roger and Emily would be saving her money , she assured them , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was cluttering up almost an entire floor at the Boston Warehouse . " Consequently , much to the annoyanceof Officer Tupperty of the Joy Street Station , traffic was several times blocked by great vans which disgorged their contents into the Fields ' house , only to return , a few days later , to cart away the rugs , furniture , paintings and objets d'art which , after careful deliberation , Roger and Emily had jointly decided were least suited to their needs and tastes . Meanwhile , the bride and groom had spent exciting and rewarding eveningswhile they chose among the rich varieties of household equipment and adornment so lavishly placed at their disposal . Emily 's obvious eagerness to meet and , if possible , to forestall all his wishes emboldened Roger to speak of his own modest possessions and to say that perhaps a few of these would also fit into the Joy Street house . There were not many  --  his mother 's silver had gone to Caroline , of course , and apparently there had not been much outstanding furniture on either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of them first editions , he thought , and a few really fine etchings , which belonged to him ; also some other odds and ends which Caroline did not care for  --  a china tea service , a spool bed with matching bureau and chairs , a very old pastel of a little girl playing with her puppy . ... Emily answered with enthusiasm . Of course she would love to have his things in their house , she told him ; she did not see why she had not suggested it herself . But somehow she had assumed that if there were anything he wanted to bring there , he would have told her so long before this , of his own accord . Roger brought as many of his possessions as he could in his old ramshackleFord and arranged for the carting of the rest with a drayman who operated one of the few remaining forlorn , horsedrawn vehicles in Cambridge ; and Emily dropped everything else she was doing to devote herself to the disposition of his belongings . When he came home , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a tea table set with his service . Why , it was spode , she told him ; she could not understand how Carolinecould help admiring it . But after all , that was their gain . Of course they must not use it every day ; it was far too valuable . But on special occasions and this one time , just for the two of them . . . . After tea , she led him upstairs to a hall bedroom which they had previously used only for storing suitcases ; these had now been relegated to the attic and the spool furniture was all in place . The pastel hung over the tiny mantel and Emily had somewhere found braided rugs to put on the floor and an oldfashionedporcelain powder box , with twin perfume bottles which went with it , for the bureau . " I 've come back to look at all this at least a dozen times since I got it fixed , " she told her husband . " If you like it as much as I do , I 'm going to52use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't done anything with the books and etchings yet . I thought we 'd hang the pictures together , after dinner , and that maybe you 'd take over the books . " After everything was in order , Roger recognized that , in its realization , the house on Joy Street had far surpassed his vision of its potentialities , when he had first become aware of it , on Christmas Eve . It had dignity and spaciousness and beauty ; but it contained no rigid chairs , no somber hangings and no overpowering family portraits . Through care and taste , Oriental rugs , Italian furniture , Russian ornaments and a heterogeneous collection of books had been assembled to create a surprising degree of harmony ; and if Emily 's decisions in regard to these had now and then been influenced by her frequent conferences with her grandmother , the expert hand of Old Mrs. Forbes had never been obtrusive . Sunlight streamed in on freshly polished floors , pleasant wallpapers and glistening white paint ; and the perfect cleanliness of the house did not detract from its easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn , there were always open fires burning behind shining brasses ; and dinner came hot and hearty and abundant to the polished table in the candlelighted dining room . The gloom of the Gloucester Street house had been perennially deepenedby " servant troubles , " and Emily had not been without secret misgivingslest she should fare no better than her mother when it came to a question of domestic help . Old Mrs. Forbes ' impeccable staff had been assembled during her years of foreign sojourn and every member of it had relatives who would gladly have augmented its numbers . But the immigrationlaws which Homer Lathrop found so deplorably lax were still sufficientlyrestrictive to make such additions complicated . A niece of Pearson , the butler , did succeed in penetrating to New England . But though her cooking had been satisfactory to the scion of a royal family in whose exaltedhousehold she had previously seen service , she had not succeeded in meeting the culinary standards of even the least exacting Bostonian who had employed her ; and Emily , while feeling certain that she was available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lizzie Pearson 's calm assumption that she would have at least two scullery maids at her disposal and a sitting room to which the humbler domestics would have access only through her condescension , put an end to the interview , which had become equally haughty on both sides ; the allowance which Emily had finally wrested from Homer Lathrop , while much ampler than he had originally intended to give her , was not elastic enough to provide for scullery maids ; and , on this occasion , Old Mrs. Forbes merely snorted with indignation when Emily referred the matter to her . " Whoever is fool enough to engage an English cook deserves a lifetime fare of Brussels sprouts and sago pudding , " she said unsympathetically . " Everyone knows that only butlers and parlormaids and children 's nurses come from England . " Her statement was so sweeping that , for the mo-53ment , she seemed to exclude even diplomats , manufacturers and men of letters from the traveling population of Great Britain , though of course this was not actually her meaning . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Continental , without the help of scullery maids ; and she will have too much energy and pride to spend hours sitting around . Private parlor indeed ! Personally , I prefer a Pole or a Dane , but that is a matter of taste and there are exceptions to the general rule . Romans and Russians often make very good servants too . " Unfortunately , there were no Poles or Danes , or even any Romans and Russians visible on the horizon when Roger and Emily prepared to move into their house on Joy Street . Emily , who was facing the prospect of her first interview at an employment agency in much the same spirit of mingledfortitude and fear which would have marked her delayed approach to a dental chair , confessed her apprehension to Roger . " Why , perhaps I could help you find someone , " he said , speaking with the pleased surprise which always marked his train of thought when he discovered that he actually had , or could , contribute something tangible to their design for living . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find out . " " Deirdre ? " " Yes . She was our general maid for years . She left us after Father died , when we sold the Brookline house . Of course Caroline and I could n't really afford to keep a maid , so I suppose it was just as well . But Deirdre 'd been with us ever since I can remember and I took it for granted she always would be . It 's never seemed the same to me without her . She and Caroline kept having arguments , though . I ought to tell you that . " " What kind of arguments ? " " Oh  --  about going to Mass . Deirdre 's very devout . And how many pounds of butter we used per week  --  she 's rather extravagant . And whether she ought to have so much company  --  she 's got an enormous family . So one day she left  --  just like that  --  and Caroline said it was good riddance to bad rubbish . I 'm not so sure . Deirdre 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry work too  --  never acts as if that were n't part of her job . Besides , I think she must feel something the way I do  --  that she really belongs to the Fields . She 's never stayed in any one place long since she left us . I know , because we 've been asked so many times to give her a reference . But I do n't think she 's ever been discharged . I think she 's left all those other families because she 's been restless . " " When can you get in touch with her ? " " Why , right away ! I 've always kept her mother 's address  --  so that I could send her little presents , you know , Christmas and Easter . " " Is she awfully old by now ? " Emily inquired , her heart warming toward Deirdre at the same time it warmed afresh toward Roger at the thought of the " little presents , " knowing he must have gone without something himself in order to buy them . " She ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't nearly as old as she seemed to me these last few years . Let 's see  --  I can remember back to the time I was five and she was young and pretty then . I 'm twenty-five now . Why , she ca n't be a day over fifty , if she 's that much ! And she was always strong as a horse . " Deirdre came to see Emily the following evening and their mutual understanding and admiration were immediate . Deirdre  --  stocky , vigorous and collected  --  was not working ; she had n't liked her last job so well , she said , implying that this would not be the case with the next one . Sure , she could start in right away  --  in the morning if Mrs. Field wanted her to . And sure , she had a niece who could help out too . Maybe the niece , Ellie her name was , could n't come till the next week , but Deirdre could manage all right alone until then . With just two in family and a fine new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's play . She left without mentioning the subject of wages and Emily did not bring it up either ; somehow it seemed out of harmony with the tenor of their talk , and both instinctively felt it could be quietly and satisfactorily settled later . But as Deirdre reached the door she turned and , with one rough , capable hand on the knob , delivered herself of a single pregnant remark . " And can I ever wait to see the look on Miss Caroline 's face when she finds me , that she turned out , in this grand house of yours ! " As it happened , Deirdre was denied this satisfaction , for Caroline learned of the unwelcome presence indirectly . She had already critically inspected the kitchen several times , while the Joy Street house was in the process of reconstruction ; and , since none of her suggestions for its improvement , though courteously received , had subsequently been followed , she decided to indicate her disapproval of her headstrong sister-in-law by refraining  --  temporarily  --  from giving her the benefit of further advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making , through being deprived of such helpful guidance , she would turn contritelyto its source , unless prevented by pride . Meanwhile , it was ridiculous , as well as lamentable , in Caroline 's considered opinion , that a girl like Emily , barely twenty-two years of age , should be allowed to have her own way about practically everything  --  about getting married , about spending large sums of money , about living on an extravagant scale in a pretentious house . Caroline did not see what Homer Lathrop must be thinking of , to permit such a succession of follies ; she quite understood why so many persons felt old Mr. Forbes must have been in his dotage when he was persuaded to select Homer as a trustee . Not that Russell Forbes , who mingled indiscriminately with all kinds of disreputable politicians , would have been any better ; and as for that gambling nonentity , Sumner Thayer . . . I Caroline could not adequately express , even to herself , the degree of contempt which she felt for Emily 's father and thissweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Mrs. Forbes ; even Caroline could not dispose of the formidablematriarch by looking down on her . But unfortunately Roger had been right in his assumption that Caroline would be even less pleased with his engagement to Emily than the Forbes ' and the Thayers . She was averse to wedlock for him on general principles ; but , if marry he must , eventually , she knew the kind of girl he should choose for his own good ; and this mythical maiden  --  preferably a docile orphan  --  bore no resemblance whatsoever to the flesh-and-blood reality with which he had permitted himself to become entangled . However , after the engagement was announced , Caroline nobly sought to be silent on the subject of her brother 's fiancee and she might have tried to be equally charitable about Old Mrs. Forbes , had she not happened to hear that this outrageous woman was highly amused by her own judicial attitude . " No doubt , " Old Mrs. Forbes was quoted as saying , " some desiccated ladies-in-waiting from The Steppes criticized the conduct of Catherine of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their lives  --  to get Catherine 's leavings . " The coarseness of this comparison , as well as its arrogance , made Carolinefeel there was no reason why Old Mrs. Forbes should be spared denunciationin the most emphatic terms of which a well-bred Bostonian was capable . She was always careful to acid , " Of course , Emily is not in the least like her grandmother . " But in what passed for her heart she was not so sure . Every now and then , she had the terrified impression that unless Emily were promptly checked and suppressed , she might develop certain traits which had characterized the fabulous Evclina . Emily was already far too self-assured and self-assertive for a girl of her age and Roger showed no signs of checking and suppressing his wife , or even of wishing to do so . Ile adored her so blindly that , apparently , she seemed to him perfect , just as she was . Caroline told herself that it was her duty to sec that her brother 's life was not completely wrecked , if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made frequent visits to the house on Joy Street during its organization . When the bridal couple was actually installed there , she appeared promptly at teatime , and was chagrined to be admitted by a neat , rosycheekedmaid in a spotless uniform , who beamed upon her with great good will and ushered her competently into the library , announcing that Mrs. Field would be down right away . A shining samovar was already singing beside the pleasant hearth ; and almost immediately Emily appeared on the circular stairway , humming a gay little tune . Caroline , who had always righteously refused to wear anything merely because it was becoming , observed , without admiration , that her sister-in-law had on a long crimson robe which . floated out behind her as she moved quickly along . Vide lace ruffles edged the elbow sleeves and square decolletage of this garment , which Caroline knew would now be classed as a hostess56gown , but to which she herself referred as a wrapper and considered inappropriatefor anything except bedroom wear ; and the entire effect of it was not only costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ! " Emily said pleasantly , as she submitted to Caroline 's solid kiss and returned it lightly . Emily did not care much for stereotyped kisses as a form of greeting between women , but she had quickly discovered that Caroline , though she derived no pleasure from such caresses , considered them an essential part of correct family ritual . " Roger is n't home yet , but I think he will be , any minute . Let 's have some tea right away , shall we ? And then some more , made fresh , when he does come . That 'll give us an excuse for second cups . " She seated herself beside the samovar , lighted a cigarette and leaned back luxuriously in her chair . Caroline did not smoke and had impressed on Emily her opinion of this " filthy habit " so forcefully that the latter did not proffer her the cloisonne box from which she helped herself casually . She crossed her knees and Caroline observed that the hostess gown , though very long , was " suggestively " cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it revealed Emily 's lovely white neck and emphasized the lines of her figure in the artful way which only a skillful dressmaker could effect . Emily , apparently quite unaware that her costume was an affront to her sister-in-law 's sense of decorum , began to chat pleasantly and inconsequentially . Caroline interrupted her . " Where did you get that maid ? " she demanded . " Ellie ? She 's cute , is n't she ? Roger found her for me . " " You do n't mean to tell me that with everything else he has to do , you 're sending Roger out to employment agencies ? " Emily laid aside her cigarette and rearranged the folds of her crimson robe . " I do n't send ' Roger anywhere , Caroline , " she said quietly . " He goes wherever he likes , whenever he likes , as far as I 'm concerned . But he has n't gone to any employment agencies yet  --  at least to my knowledge . He knew Ellie before we were married . Or rather , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a vague way , as one of Deirdre 's nieces . You must have seen her around sometimes too . " " You do n't mean to tell me that the maid who opened the door for me was one of that gang of grimy , runny-nosed children that Deirdre had around all the time ? " " I suppose she must have been . Hush  --  here she is now with the tea . " Beaming more proudly than ever , Ellie entered with the tray and set it down on the small mahogany table beside Emily . Mindful of the injunctionthat the spode was to be saved for special occasions  --  among which Ellie saw no reason to number a visit from Miss Caroline Field  --  the maid had not used this ; instead , she had surprisingly selected a silver-gilt service which harmonized so well with the samovar that she guessed , and rightly , that the two had some previous connection with each other , without having any idea of their value , which Emily had so far neglected to57rose to torment her again . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're paying Deirdre perfectly fantastic wages , " she added accusingly . " No doubt . " " What do you mean , ' no doubt , ' Emily ? " " Why , probably the same thing you did ! I have n't discussed wages with her yet . I have n't had time . " " You have n't had time! You lie in bed half the morning and then you say you have n't had time to settle a vital point like a servant 's wages ! " " I 'm trying to concentrate on essentials . The first essential , in my opinion , was to get the house running , comfortably and pleasantly . I think it is . I 'm very happy here . I believe Roger is too . " She glanced about her with obvious contentment . Caroline followed the glance grudgingly . There was no denying that Emily , in spite of her inexperience , had somehow produced a very pleasing effect . But after all , this was not so strange when one considered that she had all that loot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money like a drunken sailor herself . And she was disturbingly pretty , in that clinging crimson robe , with those ruffles of old lace fluffing out around her arms and shoulders . She had a great deal more color than when she was younger and she seemed to have filled out a little , which was becoming too ; she had been rather too thin before . Caroline could only hope that these beguiling curves which had begun to appear did not presage anything more than a slight increase in weight . It would really be too disgusting , if so soon ... . " Does n't Roger have a key ? " she inquired , cutting short her own train of thought as she heard a step in the hallway and saw Ellie hurrying toward the front door . " Yes , of course . Apparently , I have another visitor . " " But surely you would n't be ' at home ' yet . " " Of course I would be . I have n't had any callers before . But evi-dently  --  " " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm delighted to learn that you are ' at home . ' Your grandmother thought you might be . I 've just been making my party-call on her . I 'm sorry it was so long delayed , because I really appreciated her invitation to your wedding reception . Also her suggestion that I might try my luck at finding you in too . " At the sound of-a strange voice , Emily had instinctively risen . Caroline sat still , watching her , as she moved gracefully across the room and held out her hand to David Salomont. tell her , supposing such an explanation to be superfluous . Having silently checked everything on the tray to make sure there were no omissions , Ellie departed to return with a well-laden muffin stand . Then she stood back and awaited further instructions , respectfully but eagerly . " Thank you very much , Ellie . I 'll ring if I want anything more , " Emily said , nodding in easy dismissal . " How many lumps of sugar , Caroline ? And I forget whether you like a spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good memory . I never touch alcohol in any form . And I 've told you over and over again that I consider it the ruinationof good China tea to put anything in it . " " I 'm sorry . Will you have a scone ? Or did you tell me something about those that I 've forgotten too ? " " I prefer toast , but I do n't suppose it 's convenient  --  " " Of course it 's convenient . That 's here too . " Emily reached to a lower shelf of the muffin stand and uncovered a deep dish . " Thcre 's plum cake too , if you like that . I thought of the scones first because Deirdre makes such good ones . " Caroline set down her cup so quickly that it made a sharp , clicking sound against the saucer . " You do n't mean to tell me --  " she began . But this time Emily interrupted . " Yes I do . Deirdre 's here too . I think she 's wonderful . " " You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast while she goes to Mass and runs up bills whenever you do n't watch her like a hawk and keeps the kitchen cluttered with her shiftless family . " Emily inspected the cigarette she had put aside , chose a fresh one from the cloisonne box , lighted it and began to blow rings . " I never liked hearty , early breakfast myself , " she remarked . " I 'm awfully relieved to find that Roger does n't either . I ca n't imagine anything worse  --  well , anything much worse  --  than being married to a man who expected you to be down in the dining room , all dressed for the day in a tailored suit , at seventhirty ; and then having grapefruit and oatmeal and bacon and eggs and , quite possibly , griddlecakes brought to you in courses . We have a tray in our bedroom , at eight-fifteen , weekdays . That gives Roger just time enough to get to his office at nine without hurrying . IIe 's clocked himself , walking across the Common , and it takes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's dressed before the tray comes up , but I do n't dream of doing so until after he 's gone . Sundays , we just ring , whenever we feel like it  --  tenish . Deirdre has n't even mentioned Mass to inc . I supposeshe goes and gets back before we need her . Anyway , we have n't had to get our own breakfast yet . " " Just wait until the newness wears off , " Caroline said warningly . " After all , you 've only just started . " She had instinctively recoiled at the reference to " our " bedroom and she was horrified to hear that a young , healthy girl like Emily indulged in the slothful habit of breakfasting in bed ; the fear that Roger 's sterling character would be undermined by lax influences58 59it ? Where did you get all these treasures  --  and learn what to do with them ? " " My grandmother helped me , " Emily replied readily . " At least , the etchings came from Roger 's family . But it was Grandmamma who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting it the way I have . And she 's loaned me lots of other things  --  among them the tea service . It was given her when Grandpapa was Ambassador to Russia , about thirty-five years ago . I never knew before it was supposed to be missing . ' " " Oh , yes , it 's had quite an interesting history . I 'll have to tell it to you sometime . " Sometime when he is n't hampered by the presence of a third person , Caroline said to herself bitterly . Not that he seems much inhibited now . In a minute , he 'll ask her how much she thinks it 's worth . But she was mistaken . Instead of asking Emily , he told her . " I believe it 's valued at something like eight thousand gold rubles , " he remarked . " But that 's a conservative estimate . I must tell my stepfather I 've seen it . He 'll be terribly jealous of me . " " Is your stepfather especially interested in such things ? " Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an antique dealer , catering to the luxury trade . So he keeps himself informed . He certainly would give anything to see this room , " David added , helping himself to the scones and looking around again with mounting admiration . " I 'd like to bring him here sometime . " " I 'd be very pleased if you would . If you let me know beforehand when to expect him , I 'll see if Grandmamma would n't join us for tea . She could tell him so much more than I could about the things she 's loaned me . She 's lame , so she does n't go out a great deal any more , but I 'm sure she 'd enjoy talking with your stepfather . " " And of course he 'd give his eyeteeth to meet her , " David said enthusiastically . " He could go to her house if it was n't convenient for her to come here  --  and come here himself , of course , beforehand or afterward . I 'll wire him tonight about your kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York unless he 's tied up with a sale or something . " " Perhaps it would be just as well , Emily , if you would find out when your grandmother is free and whether she feels equal to making new acquaintances at this time . " Caroline spoke freezingly . Only her sense of duty constrained her to stay in the same room with this common , pushing person . But she did not feel she should leave Emily alone with such an obnoxious creature . There was no telling what might happen . " I 'll telephone and ask her . It wo n't take me but a minute . Did you go to the game last Saturday , Mr. Salomont ? Caroline did n't and I 'm sure she 'd love to have you tell her about it . " David had not been to the game , having remained at the office all day 6Chapter 6HE CAME FORWARD with all the assurance of a welcome guest , the freshnessof his face and the breeziness of his bearing in no way suggesting that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrast to the telltale signs of fatigue which Roger failed to conceal when returning from the office . On the other hand , something about the superb cut of David 's clothes and the spotlessness of his starched linen reminded her of the way in which Homer Lathrop always managed to appear , whatever he had been doing and no matter how long . Roger not only looked tired when he came home , he looked rather rumpled . Of course , he could not afford to patronize costly tailors and haberdashers , as Homer did , and as David apparently did too ; but this faculty of looking both vigorous and immaculate was not , Emily realized , merely a matter of physical strength or ample funds . It was a special aptitude which Homer and David had in common and which Roger unfortunately lacked . As Emily greeted David with cordiality , Caroline stiffened in her chair . Matters were at a pretty pass indeed if a presumptuous Jew could come , uninvited , to her brother 's house  --  in her brother 's absence  --  and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the barest possible inclination of the head . But the gesture lost some of its effect , because David forestalled her with the mocking quality of his own greeting . " I 'm sure you would n't remember me , Miss Field , " he said . " I was only one of the wedding guests who belong in the category of those brought in from the highways and byways . ' " Having made this announcement , he appeared to forget her entirely and , after accepting a cup of tea from Emily , looked about him with obvious appreciation . " What a delightful room ! Roger 's been bragging all over the office about his bride 's accomplishmentsas a domestic organizer . But I did n't realize that she 'd have so many museum pieces at her disposal . That 's as fine a Gaugengigl as I ever saw , over there , and I do n't know that I ever saw one more advantageously placed . And this is the missing ' tea service from the Winter Palace , isn't6oworking on a libel case which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , he had been to the recent opening of Porgy and Bess and proceeded to dissect it expertly , unabashed by Caroline 's terse statement that she had previously heard it was disgusting . When Emily returned to the library , he leaped up to greet her with the satisfied air of a man who has just engaged in a singularly stimulating conversation . " Miss Field and I 've been discussing the drama , " he said . " I have found her viewpoint extremely illuminating . . . . I hope you have a good report for me about your talk with your grandmother ? " " She 'd like very much to meet your stepfather . In fact , she thinks she may have met him already . Is his name Morris Brucker ? " " It certainly is ! Did she say when and where  --  " " Budapest first . St. Petersburg afterward . I gathered that was another interesting story , though she was n't too definite as to time . But apparently they did n't lose touch with each other until ' 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met since he settled in New York and married . But anyway , she 'd be glad to have him come in for a cocktail , after he 's been to tea here , any day next week except Friday . " " So that 's still sacred to the Symphony ! Well , more power to her ! I 'll get in touch with the old man and drop by again to give you his answer . ... No thanks ; not that they are n't the very best scones , but scones do n't happen to be among my major enthusiasms . They 're not in the same league with the Schnecken my aunt makes . She wo n't give away the recipe , but probably your cook could figure out how to make them , if she tasted one . I 'll ask Dad to bring some over from New York with him . WellsorryI ca n't wait to see Roger . I 'm having an early dinner with the Stockbridges in Chestnut Hill . Probably Roger 's told you that Ellery Stockbridge 's slated to be president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's one of our most promising clients . But he 's a little on the stiff side . Just the sort of man that outsiders seem to feel is typical of Boston . Good night , Miss Field . I really think you ought to reconsider and go to see that play . " Roger arrived barely five minutes after David had left , so there was not much chance , during the interval , for Caroline to impress Emily with her disapproval  --  especially as Emily seemed willfully bent on being pleasant and was , moreover , preoccupied with the prospect of Roger 's impending arrival . She heard his key turn in the latch before Caroline detected any such sound and ran out into the hall to meet him . The next sounds were easily identified , even by Caroline , and there was a considerable delay before Roger and Emily came into the library . Roger was smoothing his hair and Emily 's pretty color was heightened . " Hello , Caroline , " Roger said and kissed her too . " How are you ? Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But I 'm usually later leaving the office than he is . He has his own secretary who polishes off all6ihis odd jobs and I have to wait for poor old Miss Riley to finish everythingMr . Mills gives her before she does my work . Half the time , when I ring for her , she just appears in the- doorway long enough to say , I ca n't come in now , I have eight more pages to do for Mr. Mills . ' That happens even when Mr. Mills is riding me for a memo . But of course I do n't rate anything better and David does . " " I have n't the slightest doubt that David Salomont would gladly leave some poor , overworked girl to polish off his odd jobs ' while he goes out on the town , " Caroline rejoined . " He seems at liberty to make any numberof engagements . He 's about to get in touch with his stepfather  --  a New York antique dealer  --  about coming over here for tea any day next week except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's going to drop in ' and report to Emily  --  presumably also at teatime . " " Well , that 's fine , " Roger replied . " I hope I wo n't miss him again . I think he 's about the most brilliant man I ever met  --  and one of the most versatile . No matter what subject crops up , it seems to be right down his alley . I do n't see how on earth he ever got hold of so much varied in-formation . " " Perhaps his stepfather 's wealthy customers gave him helpful hints when he was helping behind the counter . Or maybe it was his aunt , in her kitchen . It seems she excels in cookery . I have no doubt she 'll soon be added to this cozy little circle David Salomont 's assembling around your tea table . Speaking of cookery , Emily tells me you 've taken Deirdre back . " " Yes , I was lucky enough to find her free . She 's doing a grand job tooatleast , Emily and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . " Caroline rose , buttoning the jacket of her severe and rather shabby suit . " No thank you , " she said . " I really had quite enough of Deirdre 's rich , indigestible food before I discharged her for wastefulness . Besides , you have dinner so late that I should miss half the Lowell lecture if I stayed . I do n't see how you keep such hours , even if you do have breakfast in your room . I can see that it 's telling on you , Roger . You look very tired to me . And you seem to be coming down with a cold . Do n't forget that your colds always settle in your chest . One of these days you 'll be having pneumonia , if you 're not more careful . Good night , Emily . I suppose it 's useless to tell you that Roger ought to go to bed at once and keep completelyquiet until he 's better . " Unfortunately , Caroline 's predictions about the symptoms of a cold proved to be correct ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper precautions to arrest their development : he was first too warm in the subway and then too chilled in the elevated , while on his way to the Middlesex Clerk 's Office at Lechmere ; he got drenched by a northeastrain while searching Somerville for a witness . By the time he did take to his bed , he was really ill for several days . Therefore , to his great regret , he missed both David 's second call and Morris Brucker 's visit . However , Emily 's detailed accounts of these served to while away some of the63tedium of his illness , though they did not compensate for her temporary absences from his side . " David has only just left , " she told him , returning a little breathlessly to his sickroom an hour or so after Ellie had announced that Mr. Salomont was in the library . " He brought us some of those Schnecken his aunt makes . They really are wonderful and I kept eating more and more of them , so of course I kept drinking more and more tea too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About his stepfather 's visit ? " " Yes , partly . Mr. Brucker 's coming over from New York next Saturday . I called Grandmamma and she said that would be fine . Uncle Russell was on the line when I first tried to get her , fussing about the election , and you know he goes on forever . That was another thing that delayed me . But most of the time David and I were talking about Morris Brucker  --  not just about his visit , but about what he 'd meant to David and David 's mother . One subject seemed to lead to another . . . . Did you know there were different kinds of Jews , Roger ? " " Why , of course there are different kinds of Jews , just as there are different kinds of Gentiles  --  good , bad and indifferent ! " " Yes , of course . But that 's not what I mean . Do you know the difference between a Sephardic Jew and an Ashkenazic Jew ? " " No , I ca n't say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . " " Well , you see ! " Emily exclaimed triumphantly . " The Sephardim are the descendants of the Portuguese and Spanish Jews , who were about the most important people on the Iberian Peninsula at the time the Moors were driven out , and they 've always felt superior to the Ashkenazic Jews , who came from northern Europe . David 's father was a Sephardic Jew . " " Was he ? " Roger inquired , without much interest . " Yes . And his mother was n't . She married above her , as the saying is . She was very proud that such a cultured man as Rafael Salomont wanted her for his wife . And she really cared very greatly for him . But she found it hard to live up to his intellectual standards . He knew seven or eight languages , several of them dead ones  --  read all the Greek plays and poems in the original for pleasure . He had any number of degrees and correspondedwith scholars all over the world . He was always preoccupied with higher things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate nature and would have been happier if her husband had been a little more demonstrative , though David did n't say that in so many words . But he did say that nearly all the money there was , except what got put aside for his education , went for books and worthy causes , never for good times and nice clothes and holiday trips , and that his mother missed such things when she was young and pleasure loving . David respects his father 's memoryvery highly ; but I think , in a way , his stepfather means more to him  --  not just because he 's had a much more comfortable , happy life himself since his mother married again , but because he believes his mother 's been64happier too . Morris Brucker 's given her everything in the world she could possibly want . He thinks the sun rises and sets on her head and he lets her see he feels that way . Besides , he 's more her kind anyhow than her first husband was . " Roger , who failed to find any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not seem to notice the omission ; she was pursuinga train of thought that was new to her . " It 's nice , is n't it , that David should be so fond of his stepfather ? I did n't think people were , usually . And it 's nice , too , that his mother should be so happy in her second marriage . I never supposed , either , that there was much romance in those . But the way David talked , I could see that a woman might sincerely love two men , in entirely different ways , at different periods of her life  --  enough to marry them both , I mean . And that she might find life more exciting all the time , in spite of growing older , if she had the kind of husband who told her how much he loved her and how beautiful she looked to him . David says his mother really is very beautiful still . He made me feel I 'd like to see her . I 'm sorry she is n't coming over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " No , because I did n't know how Grandmamma would feel about it . I thought perhaps she 'd rather see Mr. Brucker without his wife . You see Grandmamma . . . . Emily left her remark unfinished and Roger did not urge her to continue . He had become more interested in her observations as she went along , but they were vaguely disquieting to him , and he did not feel that a discussion of Old Mrs. Forbes ' characteristics would be any less so . If encouraged , Emily would probably next voice the conclusion , which it took no great perception to reach , that her grandmother , in spite of her age , was not averse to proving her undeniable powers of attraction for almost any male who came within her orbit , and that she could do this more conveniently when unhampered by the presence of his wife , if he had one . To be sure , Old Mrs. Forbes had married only once ; there was nothing in her history which would help to develop a train of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one supposed , for a moment , that her husband had been the one love of her life . Indeed , it was common knowledge that she had not lacked opportunities to remarry , even recently , and also that she had fascinated any number of admirers while her husband was still living . Though she had never caused an open scandal , Roger could not help believing that this was due partly to adroit management . Altogether , it was better to let the subject of romance drop .... It was inevitably revived , however , after Morris Brucker 's visit . Accordingto plan , the antique dealer came to Joy Street with his stepson , and snatches of animated conversation and echoes of hearty laughter from the library below reached Roger in his sickroom . The voices became clearer65as Emily and her visitors came out into the front hall . She called up to Roger and he could tell from the way she sounded that she was enjoying herself very much . " We 're off to Grandmamma 's , Roger . . . . Anything I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . Tell Mr. Brucker again how sorry I am to miss him . David too . Have a good time , all of you . " He was very hoarse , it hurt him to raise his voice and a fit of coughing followed the effort . But the others were already outside by that time , so he was not self-conscious about the racket he made , and presently the sound of their footsteps on the brick pavement died away in the distance , as they went on up the Hill . Almost at the same moment , the clock struck five , and he told himself that Emily would surely be back by six , that they would still have an hour together before she went down to dinner and Ellie came up with his tray . He tried to read , but his eyes smarted and watered , so he gave up the attempt and lay in the dark , listening for Emily 's return . This was so long delayed that he began to fear something untoward had happened , and it took real will power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and call Old Mrs. Forbes ' house . Seven o'clock came and with it Deirdre instead of Ellie , bearing a tray designed to be tempting  --  broth in a covered bowl of Chinese porcelain , hot butteredtoast , ice-cold milk , a custard that slipped smoothly down his sore throat . Deirdre snapped the folding legs of the tray into an upright positionand placed it firmly on Roger 's knees . " If you had two good mouthfuls of that fine dinner I sent up to you , Mr. Roger , I would n't know it from the looks of your plate when Ellie brought it down . She do n't dare speak up to you , the poor young girl . But I do . And I 'm staying right here till you lick that platter clean . " " Your food 's wonderful , Deirdre , just as it always was . But I 've got such a splitting headache  --  " " Offer it up , Mr. Roger , offer it up ! That 's what I do when my rheumatismalmost gets me down and I yell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that , I do n't starve myself . " Deirdre had turned on the lights and it was clear that she did not intend to budge until Roger had eaten everything on the tray , under her watchfuleye . He did so haltingly and without tasting any of it , and when he had finished and Deirdre had gone , he unfolded the Evening Transcript , which she had brought at the same time with his supper . Election time was nearing and Russell Forbes , he knew , was worried about his Senate seat . Roger felt he should find out how things were going in the campaign , but he did not really care much , and when he found nothing on the front page , he did not search any further . Then the telephone rang and he snatched it up . But it was not Emily calling ; it was the doctor , inquiring how he was . " Sorry I could n't get in this afternoon , Roger , but I got caught in a 66jam . Couple of real emergencies . I can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 's the temperature ? " " A hundred and one point two at four o'clock . " " Well , that 's not bad . Still coughing a good deal ? " " Just about the same . I do n't get much sleep . I 'm afraid Emily does n't either . " " I 'll send you a stronger sedative . Take a capsule every hour and two if you 're still restless by midnight . See you the first thing in the morning . Or , as I said , I 'll be glad to come tonight if you want me . " " No , tomorrow 'll be fine . But it does bother me to talk much . So long . " He did not want the doctor butting in when Emily finally did get home . And surely she would be there any minute now . But he waited and waited and still she did not come . . . . He had almost dozed off when he was suddenly aware of her presence and sat up with a start , to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepened as they always were when she was especially pleased about something . She put her arms around him and hugged him ecstatically . " I 've had such a good time ! " she exclaimed . " Morris Brucker is the greatest fun ! Not especially good looking , in fact , sort of shriveled , but the best company , amusing and lively and very , very witty . You should have heard him and Grandmamma sparring ! He said that when she was first in St. Petersburg , she used to go to his shop very often and that they had wonderful talks together , while she made selections from his stock ; but then he lost her as a customer , because all the grand dukes gave her so many presents that she did n't need to buy anything more from him . So then , he had to invent ways of getting her back , he said , because he missed her company so much . He kept teasing her while they were talking about old times and she simply loved it . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did anyone tell the story of the missing tea service ? " " No one told the story , but Grandmamma and Mr. Brucker both referred to it in a cryptic way . And finally , he took a little package out of his pocket and told her that , since there were no more grand dukes , he 'd ventured to bring her a present himself . She undid the package and there was a signet ring in it  --  a man 's ring with a great carved emerald ; I think the carving was the Russian double eagle , though I could n't see very clearly . She did n't say a word , just sat and turned the ring over and over , and then she put it on and looked at him  --  and Roger , there were tears in her eyes ! " " But you never heard the history of the ring either ? " " No . There was something mysterious about the whole meeting , somethinga little uncanny , even though everyone joked so much . It did n't seem a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like an encounter that might happen in the Balkans , for instance . " " What do you know about encounters in the Balkans ? " " I do n't know anything . I 'm just imagining . But I loved everything about the evening . I thought it was all terribly exciting . Grandmamma still had that ring on when I left and she told Mr. Brucker she thought he 'd better stay to dinner , it was getting so late . I think she must have meant all along to ask him , because she said they would have borsch , and I have n't known her to do that in a long time . But she did n't ask David and me to stay . " " So David brought you home ? " " Yes . We had a good time walking up the Hill and trying to figure out the story about the ring . Of course , David does know the one about the tea set . He said there was n't time to tell me between Louisburg Square and Joy Street  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we could loiter along . We really did have to hurry , there was such a nip in the air . I thought of asking him to stay to dinner here , so that he could n't use lack of time as an excuse . I think he half expected I would . " " I 'm rather glad you did n't . Not that I want you to be tantalized indefinitelyby curiosity . We 'll ask David some other time . But I 've missed you a lot , darling . " He did not say he hoped she would not leave him again while he was ill or that she would not entertain any more visitors until they could do this together . But she realized this was how he felt and , fearful lest her own excellent health might have made her insensitive , she reproached herself for having been lacking in tenderness and devotion toward him . During the next few days she redoubled her efforts to keep him comfortable and to divert his mind , remaining with him constantly ; and eventually , on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . " What would you think of giving a little dinner , darling ? " he asked . Emily had been reading aloud to him from Drums Along the Mohawk but , with the coming of twilight  --  the hour which they found increasingly companionable  --  she had laid aside the book and was sitting quietly beside his bed with her hand in his . She answered with enthusiasm . " Why , I 'd like to ! As a matter of fact , I 'd been meaning to suggest it myself , as soon as you were well enough . " " I 'm well enough now to plan . . . . David seems to feel welcome here already . I 'd like to have Brian and Pell feel the same way . Incidentally , do you remember asking me , the day we were married , how Mr. Cutter happened to run across Pell ? " " Yes , and you told me you had n't the least idea . " " I did n't have then . But since , I 've found out . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would . " She sounded not only interested , but eager . Roger was delighted that he was now able to answer the question she had asked so long before . It 68had troubled him that all he could say was , " I have n't the least idea , " when she asked him the first time . " Well , when he got through studying law at Northeastern , he opened a little office with his shingle in the window , on the ground floor of the same house where he has a room on the third story .... I 've told you he lives on Joy Street too , have n't I ? " " Why no , you have n't ! How nice that he 's a neighbor ! " " Well , you could n't really call him a neighbor . He lives on the other side of the Hill , opposite the police station . It 's way down near CambridgeStreet . I do n't believe you 've ever been that far . " Emily , who took a walk every day as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go down there tomorrow morning though , " she added . " Good idea  --  you 'll be amazed to see how the street changes once you 're over the crest of the Hill . Of course , Pell is n't in that spare little office I was talking about , any more . I can tell you just about what it was like though . There was a sign in the window with the words , ATTORNEY AT LAW , NOTARY PUBLIC , after his name . And the office had just a few pieces of beat-up , old , secondhand furniture and Pell 's diplomas on the wall  --  the one from the parochial high school and the one from Boston College and the one from Northeastern . I 'm sure he could n't have afforded to keep a secretary all day , but he 'd probably have had one part time  --  mostly the time when he had to be out himself , so someone would be there if a client happened to come in . This secretary might have been one of his relatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in their tenement . " " He has n't moved then ? I mean his living quarters ? " " I do n't think so , but that 's not the point . The big shot who owned this tenement wanted to get Pell 's relatives out for a tenant who would pay higher rent , and since the lease still had some time to run , he needed an excuse for breaking it . Well , on some saint 's day or other , the Italians had a nice , comfortable family party and in the course of it they put away quite a lot of Dago Red along with their pizza and made a lot of halnoise . So the realtor brought eviction proceedings , claiming that the party was a lot wilder than it really had been . He gave the case to Cutter , Mills and Swan . " " Whereupon Pell defended the Italians , I suppose . " " And how ! He won their case for them hands down and Mr. Cutter decided then and there that he was exactly the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to get back to where we started : I thought we might invite Brian and David and Pell here all together , so none of them would think we were singling him out from the others . " " That 's a good idea , said the tiger . ' Did you want to have the dinner stag ? " " And give up having you around ? Never , if I can help it ! " He leaned over to make the statement more emphatic . " No , I thought we 'd better 69ask three girls too  --  Caroline and Marion Swan and anyone else you 'd like . " " Caroline was pretty rude to David Salomont the other day , " Emily said doubtfully . " Do you think we ought to risk having her snub him like that again ? " Roger laughed , and though the laugh ended in a cough it was an untroubledone . " Do n't worry about that . David 's more than a match for Caroline . He can tell her off any time he likes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you believe she 'd consider it a compliment to be asked to dinner with David Salomont ? And rememberwhat she said about Deirdre 's wonderful foodl " " She 'd be very much hurt if we did n't ask her to our first dinner , no matter who the other guests were or who cooked it . Ask her anyway , darling , if you do n't mind . If she says no , you can always ask someone else . " He began to cough again and Emily said they must n't talk any more about the dinner just then , but that she would speak to Deirdre about it the first thing in the morning ; afterward , she would bring him two tentativemenus so that he could choose between them and make other suggestions . She was sure , if Uncle Sherman knew they were going to have their first dinner , he would send them some game from the Cape . And there was Uncle Homer 's famous cellar on which he had told her to draw at any time . He knew all about vintages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she intended to learn . When it came to the way the table ought to look , she was on firmer ground ; she was sure that nothing could be more suitablethan her point de Venise cloth and her Sevres service . Roger so highly approved both the menus which she submitted to him the following day that Emily was obliged to choose between them herself after all ; and he assented to her every suggestion in regard to the dinner . There were several reasons why the choice of her cousin , Priscilla , for the third girl seemed to him wise : it would have indicated a lack of delicacy to ask Uncle Sherman for game if no member of his immediate family were invited to share it ; as it was , Sherman could bring Priscilla and the ducks to Joy Street at the same time and he would , of course , be urged to remain for tea . At the moment , this gesture of hospitality would be adequate  --  no one expected a young couple to make their first formal dinner too much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priscilla , who was now seventeen , were to come out the following year , it was high time for her to have a little preliminary social training ; she and her brothers and sisters had run wild among the cranberry bogs far , far too long . Roger had noticed her trapped look at the wedding and he also recalled that , strangely enough , this had been less marked when David Salomont tried to engage her briefly in conversation . To be sure , as far as Roger could tell from the distance at which he had observed them , shehad responded mostly in monosyllables ; and he would have thought , offhand , that David was the last sort of person who could have helped to put a girl like Priscilla at her ease . Nevertheless , Roger had retained a very definite impression that such had been the case . In response to Emily 's suggestion , he mentioned this , and said he thought it would be a good plan to put David and Priscilla side by side at table . Emily agreed and from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think we ought to put Mrs. Putnam at your right and Mr. Putnam at mine , do n't you , Roger ? After all , they 're older people . We ought to pay them a compliment . " Inwardly , Roger had been less enthusiastic about Emily 's selection of the Putnams than over her choice of Priscilla . Mr. Putnam was a third husband who had appeared tardily on the scene ; Roger had nothing against him , and was indeed rather sorry for him ; but he did not seem likely to provide stimulating conversation at a dinner table . Mrs. Putnam , on the other hand , always talked too much and sometimes drank too much ; her stories frequently verged on the vulgar . But her appearance was undeniably striking and her breezy manner was not without its own boisterous attraction . Moreover , her family background , like her husband 's , was " good " and on this account much had been forgiven her by people who had forgotten the details of her earlier marital adventures or had been too young to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was extremely hospitable , and entertained lavishly in her large house on Louisburg Square had also contributed to the forgetfulness of a considerable group , even though this did not include Homer Lathrop . Roger had been to a few of her prodigal parties , so he was prepared to acknowledge . his social indebtedness to her when Emily mentioned this ; and , little by little , he came to feel that his bride had been right in wishing to include the Putnams on the dinner list . They were not too highbrow to mingle readily with his fellow juniors ; Mrs. Putnam would help to make things go ; and since there was a social debt to be paid , probably the sooner it was out of the way the better ... . " Well , we 've got that far . Mr. Putnam at your right and Mrs. Putnam at mine . Who goes on our left ? " " I thought I 'd put Pell on mine . He 's been with Cutter , Mills and Swan longer than the others , has n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that this seniority entitled Pell to a certain precedence , she went on , a little hurriedly , " And Marion on yours , I should think . After all , if it had n't been for her , you probably would n't be connected with the firm at all . " " No , I suppose I would n't  --  that is , not if Caroline and Marion had n't got so chummy . And of course I ca n't have Caroline beside me . " " I thought I 'd put her between Pell and Brian . It could n't possibly be any worse than putting her beside David and there 's just a chance it might be better . " 71 " I guess you 're right again . Well , let 's have a look at the plan , the way it 's shaped up now . " Emily handed him the sheet of paper on which she had drawn a large oval surrounded by small circles , each with a name scribbled against it . Roger regarded it approvingly . " Hostess , Mr. Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Host , Mrs. Putnam , Mr. Collins , Miss Field , Mr. de Lucca . . . . Yes , that seems to work out very nicely . But since the party 's all planned now , ca n't we take a little time off ? It 's a long while since you 've given me a kiss . " EVERYTHING CONTINUED TO go propitiously with the preparations for the dinner party . All the prospective guests accepted their invitations . Ellie repolished the already shining silver and reverently took down the most precious porcelain from the highest pantry shelf . Deirdre found that another buxom niece , named Dolly , was free to accommodate on the night of the dinner , and busied herself with the concoction of various delicacies . Flowers for the decorations were delivered at just the right moment , not so far ahead of time that they would lose their first freshnessand not so late that Emily would have had to hurry with their arrangement ; and when Sherman Forbes arrived with Priscilla and the ducks , he was in such rare good humor that Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than she had ever experienced in previous contacts with him . " Quite a nice place you 've got here , " Sherman had said , looking about him approvingly . " Sorry Sue did n't come with me . I 'd have liked to have her see it too . But , doing all her own work , it 's hard for her to get away from the Cape . " " I know , " Emily replied , without adding , as Old Mrs. Forbes would have done , that she also knew that there was not the slightest need for Sue 's intensive domesticity . " But I 'd love to have her . Perhaps she 'll come some other time , Uncle Sherman . " " Well , perhaps . . . . Of course , we 've got to do something about Pris , sooner or later . " " Yes , of course . And I 'd be glad to help , Uncle Sherman . I mean , naturally Grandmamma will want to give Pris her coming-out party , but  --  " " To tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased if she did . You know Sue and Mother have never hit it off and Pris shies like a frightened filly every time she sets eyes on Her Imperial Highness . But if the kid could stay with you and Roger  --  " " We 'll have her here a lot this winter , Uncle Sherman , and see how it works . Then , in the spring , we 'll ask her how she feels about her73coming-out party  --  her and Grandmamma both . We would n't want to hurt Grandrnamma 's feelings . " " You would n't want to dent the Rock of Gibraltar , I suppose . But we 'll let that pass . I hope you 'll enjoy the ducks . If you want any more , just tell me . Of course , the season does n't last long , but there are ways and means . With one lawmaker in the family , there ought to be a lawbreakertoo , just to balance things , ought n't there ? . . . Well , I must be pushing along . Compton 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard freeze this evening and I want to make sure he 's overflowed the ditches . I generally stay up all night to look after such things myself . Bring Roger down for a week end sometime soon . Do you both good to see how the other half lives . I 'll tell Sue about your offer . She 'll appreciate it . So do I. " He departed in great good humor , leaving his niece in equally high spirits . She took one last look at the perfectly prepared dinner table , assured herself that the pantry was equally well ordered and started upstairs . Priscilla had gone straight to her room , declining her cousin 's offer of tea and saying she wanted to unpack . Emily had assured her that Ellie would do the unpacking , but Priscilla had looked so frightened at the suggestion that Emily had not insisted ; now she decided to see how the poor girl was getting along before she herself began to dress . As she mounted to the second story , she was already busy with expansive plans for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked at the door of the little guest room where Roger 's spool furniture had been installed . She opened the door part way , to be confronted by the sight of Priscilla , struggling into her bridesmaid 's dress . One of its fastenings had caught on her bra and she stood , half smothered in lace and tulle , frantically trying . to free herself , her back and head bent , her hands wrenching at the refractory hook . Stifling a laugh , Emily released her and pulled the dress down to its proper place , inevitably observing , while she did so , that Priscilla was beautifully built and that her skin , where it had not been ruthlessly exposed to the elements , was unusually soft and white . It was too bad she did not know what to do with her hair or what to put on . Her tight red curls were uncombed and the bridesmaid 's dress , which had been so suitable for an ebalorate June wedding , would have looked entirelyout of place for a small autumn dinner , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now limp and the lace torn in several places . Evidently , the dress had been carelessly put away after the wedding and not even inspected again before it was tossed into a suitcase and brought back to Boston that day . Emily experienced a momentary feeling of irritation because Priscilla had not been provided with something smart and seasonable in satin or velvet . This would not have necessitated so much as a special trip to town , for , with her figure , Priscilla could have stepped straight into any standardsizedmodel ; an earlier start that morning would have been all that was74necessary . And certainly expense was no object ; if Priscilla had bought out a specialty shop , either Sherman or Sue could have paid the bill without wincing . Really , it was time somebody else in the family took hold and Emily was quite prepared to do so . But she knew she must proceed cautiously . She would have liked to offer Priscilla one of her own dresses , then and there , but this would hurt the girl 's feelings and anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily was the taller of the two . She did not even dare offer to mend the torn lace . Priscilla , still a bit breathlessafter her struggle , looked at her cousin with miserable eyes and put a piteous question to her . " Emily , do I have to go down to dinner ? Could n't I have it up here on a tray , the way I had my tea ? " " My dear child , you 've come on purpose for the party ! " " I know . But I did n't want to . I would n't have , if it had n't been for keeping Daddy company when he brought the ducks . I do n't like parties any better than he and Mummy do . " " Is n't it too soon to decide ? You have n't been to many parties yet , have you ? I really believe you 'll like this one . And David Salomont would be terribly disappointed if he did n't see you again . You remember him , do n't you ? You and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Y-e-e-s , I remember him . But I do n't believe he remembers me . And I do n't believe he wants to see me again , even if he does . I could n't think of anything to say to him before . He must have thought I was a Dumb Dora . I am too . I wo n't be able to think of anything to say tonight either . " " Do n't you worry . David will do the talking , just as he did at the wedding . And he does remember you , truly he does . He told Roger he was looking forward to seeing you again . " Instead of appearing pleased at this information , Priscilla 's expression became more terrified than ever . Emily was afraid that if she left her , the girl might actually lock herself in her room and decline to come out . " Listen , Priscilla , it would help me a lot if you 'd go down to the library right now . You 're dressed already and I have n't so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't even in the house yet . If one of the guests happened to come early  --  " " You mean I 'd be all alone down there with some perfect stranger ? Oh , Emily , I could n't ! Please  --  " " It would only be for a few minutes . And one of us has got to be downstairs . You can turn on the radio  --  there 's an awfully good program beginningat seven-fifteen . If a guest comes early , you can pretend you 're so absorbed in it that you do n't want to be interrupted . " " I do n't like the radio . I never listen to it . I do n't even know how to turn those knobs and things . . . . You have n't got a dog , have you , Emily ? A dog would help a lot . " " No , I 'm sorry . I have n't got a dog . Deirdre has a cat though . Would you like me to get Deirdre 's cat ? " 75 " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else I can offer you from the animal kingdom , but I 'll come down to the library with you and turn the radio on for you . You can make believe you like it , ca n't you ? " With less gentleness than she habitually showed , Emily propelled Priscilla , still protesting , down the stairs , installed her in the library and fairly fled to her own room . She was really short of time now , Roger was still absent and she knew the doorbell would be ringing any moment . Presentlyit did ring . If that were only David . . . . But it was not David . It was Caroline , who had come with Marion . Caroline 's harsh voice penetrated to the second story . " We 're not to take our wraps upstairs ? Are you sure ? You look like a new maid . Probably you do n't know . I always go upstairs . " " Please ma'am , I 'm Deirdre 's niece , Dolly , accommodating for the dinner . And Mrs. Field said , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloakroom . " Dolly sounded almost as frightened as Priscilla had , but her highpitched voice also had a penetrating quality and it was clear that she was standing up to Caroline . Marion said something that was evidently conciliatory , though just what it was Emily could not hear , for Marion 's tones were more subdued . Then the two guests were apparently ushered into the library and Emily 's heart smote her , thinking of poor Priscilla . Emily had pulled on her dress hastily and now she was snapping her bracelets . Next would he her earrings , then just a dash of perfume and she could go down . She was screwing on the second earring when the doorbellrang again and Mrs. Putnam 's hearty laugh sounded through the hallway . " Who'da thunk it ? Little Em'ly blossoming out like this , givin ' dinners n'everything . Are you there , Em'ly ? Oh  --  she has n't come down yet . Why hello , Roger  --  are you invited to this party too ? So 's Jasper , so 's Jasper . You remember Jasper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes to my parties , just like you 're coming to Little Em'ly 's . Only I make him come on time ! " If Mrs. Putnam 's greeting to the returning master of the house were a sample of what could be expected of her throughout the evening , it had certainly been a mistake to invite her . But thank heaven , Roger was home at last , and evidently one of his fellow juniors had arrived at the same moment , for Emily could hear another male voice . Then there was a slight delay , suggesting that the host was apologetically introducing guests to each other before he came racing up the stairs . He and Emily met on the threshold of their room . " I 'm terribly sorry , darling . It 's the same old story . Mr. Mills was n't through with Miss Riley and I had to wait for her . There was a draft of a will that simply had to be finished tonight . But I thought of course you 'd be ready . " 76 " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a **27;5250;TOOLONG to get her on the scene at all . Tell you about it later . I must dash now . . . . Who besides the Putnams came in at the same time you did ? " " Pell . " " Oh  --  I hoped it might be David . Well  --  hurry , wo n't you , Roger ? " " Of course . " He had unbuttoned his vest and undone his tie while they were talking and now he went hastily along , pulling off his coat . For the first time since their marriage , they had not even exchanged a kiss after a day 's separation . Emily flew on down the stairs , dropping an earring she had put on with such speed that she had fastened it insecurely . It fell in front of her , exactly where she could not see , and she was obliged to stop and search for it . When she finally found it , she screwed it almost savagely into place and rushed along , reaching the bottom step just as Dolly opened the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to see you ! Now everything will be all right . " " Of course everything will be all right . What do you mean ? " " I ca n't stop to explain now . Come on in with me ! " She had intended to greet her guests , rather formally , in the drawing room , where she had arranged the flowers and studied the lighting with the greatest care . But Priscilla had not stirred from her place by the radio and everyone else had naturally drifted out to the library . As Emily welcomedthem all in turn , she noticed that the ash trays already indicated careless use , and that the company had that expectant and slightly thwarted look , suggesting that drinks have been too long delayed . LeavingDavid , who had competently made the rounds with her , to cope with the situation , she hurried to the pantry . " You may begin serving the cocktails right away , Ellie . You 'll have to manage alone . Dolly ca n't leave the door . Mr. Collins is n't here yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go back for the canapes , ma'am ? " " Yes  --  yes  --  I guess you 'd better . Then , of course after Mr. Collins does come and you have Dolly to help you , you can both circulate , the way we planned . " " Would you just taste the Martinis for me , ma'am ? Mr. Field said he would , to be sure they was all right , but he has n't , and you know he 's always made them himself before . " " Yes , I know . But I 'm sure they 're all right . Anyway , I ca n't stop , Ellie , I simply ca n't . And Mr. Field is n't downstairs yet . You must bring the cocktails right in . " Strange that Ellie , who had been so cheerful and capable up to that night , had apparently sensed that everything was not going as it should and had caught the prevailing malaise . Well , it could not be helped , and when Dolly was released , probably the two cousins would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere of stiffness still prevailed. 77Caroline and Marion were seated side by side on one of the sofas which stood at right angles to the fireplace , Mr. and Mrs. Putnam on the other . Priscilla was still cowering in her corner . David had not rescued her ; apparently he had started to do so when Mrs. Putnam had waylaid him , for she was leaning in his direction , telling one of her shady stories , while Mr. Putnam sat mute and uncomfortable beside her . Pell , graceful and attractivein spite of his ill-fitting clothes , was standing near Marion , talking to her quietly . His slight , but evident shyness was not unbecoming ; it rather added to his appeal and Marion was responding to him more or less adequately . Caroline , like Mr. Putnam , sat in silence , but her silence , instead of being shamed , was grim . Roger and the cocktails arrived almost simultaneously , and when he had taken charge of the mixer , and begun to dispense drinks with a hospitable hand , the strain in the atmosphere slackened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so were the canapes which Ellie brought in their wake  --  the small squares of toast thickly overlaid with caviar , the beaten biscuits stuffed with Virginia ham , the piping hot sausages wrapped in crisp bacon . David had successfully eluded Mrs. Putnam and reached Priscilla in her corner , Mr. Putnam had wandered over toward Caroline and said something about the weather to which she took no exception , and Marion and Pell seemed increasingly at ease with each other . Emily sat down on the sofa beside Mrs. Putnam , allowing the lively lady to rattle on , while she continued to glance from Roger , making his welcome rounds with the mixer , to the clock , whose hands now pointed to eight-fifteen . She had told Deirdre she was sure they could count on getting to the table promptly at eight , with the guests invited for seven-thirty ; and here was Brian Collins three quarters of an hour late already ! What was worse , when he did come , he would want a drink  --  two or three of them , to judge by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducks would be utterly ruined , those beautiful ducks which Sherman had brought to her with such pride and which Deirdre by this time would have cooked to a turn ! As for the souffle , that would have to be omitted altogether . Deirdre had told Emily that she could keep one from falling for fifteen minutes , by putting a little tapioca in the mixture ; but no one could keep a souffle from falling for half an hour . . . . The next time Roger passed near her with his mixer , she whispered to him . " Do n't you think you 'd better telephone the Collins ' house ? There must be some mistake . " He nodded , set down the mixer , which Mrs. Putnam immediately picked up , and went out to the rear hall . Emily , listening now instead of watching , caught only fragments of what he was saying . When he returned to the library , his expression was troubled . He spoke to Emily in a low voice . " I talked with his mother . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , he had to come all the way from South Boston ! " That does n't take an hour , dear . It does n't take half an hour even . I 'm afraid there 's been an accident . " " There 's no way we can find out , is there ? What shall we do ? " " I hate to sit down without him . It would be so awkward if he did turn up , for him to find us halfway through dinner . Could n't we wait fifteen minutes longer ? " " Yes , I suppose so . " The poor ducks ! The ill-fated souffle ! Well , anything was better than hurting Roger 's feelings , when he was upset already . Emily was both watching and listening now  --  watching the clock again , listening for the telephone as well as the doorbell . But , by making a great effort , she managed to keep her mind on her duties as a hostess too . Adroitly , she shifted Pell to a place beside Mrs. Putnam , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in too abruptly on his conversation with Marion . Then she asked Marion to make room for Mr. Putnam between herself and Caroline  --  the sofa was such a large one , it was a pity not to have it used by three persons ! Using this same persuasive argument , she drew David and Priscilla from their corner , saw Priscilla ensconced beside Pell and herself engaged David in small talk . The clock struck the half hour . " I would n't worry about Brian if I were you , " David said reassuringly . " He 'll turn up all right . " " Roger 's worrying about him . I 'm not . I 'm worrying about my dinner . " " Then I would n't worry about that , any longer . " " Evidently I do n't have to . Dolly 's opening the front door right now . " Her voice betrayed her relief ; but this was short-lived . When the portieresparted , Brian Collins was revealed wearing a salt-and-pepper suit and red tie . However , this was not the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his normally keen eyes were glazed . He looked about him and laughed loudly . " Well now , a real party , is it ? I thought it was going to be just us boys . getting together for a fine poker game , or the like of that . I 've got glad rags myself at home , believe it or not , but I never bothered putting them on . " " We were getting worried about you , Brian , " Roger said , still speaking in a troubled voice . " I telephoned your house and your mother told me you left home over an hour ago . Did you have an accident ? " " Accident ? Accident ? Never had an accident in my life . You did say seven-thirty , I remember that now . But then I knew you were always late getting home yourself , so I just stopped in to chew the rag and drink a drop with my cousin , Tim Tupperty , around the corner from the station . You ought to get to know Tim yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he does know you , halfway , seeing as he was one of the traffic cops at your wedding . What 's more , he swears you must be the swell he pried loose from a drunk that latched onto you Christmas Eve . " 78 ' 79 " Unless you 'd like another drink , Mr. Collins , we 'll go out to dinner now . You 're taking my sister-in-law , Miss Field . David , will you take Priscilla ? And Mr. de Lucca , I have to separate you and Miss Swan after we get to the dining room , but you can have the pleasure of each other 's company that far . Mrs. Putnam , you lead off with Roger , of course , and Mr. Putnam , you and I 'll bring up the rear . " It was inexcusable to have said " another , " Emily knew that . But she was angry , so angry that she had been obliged to force herself to give the conventional directions . Only that one word had come out spontaneously . She hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger had not heard it . But anyway , she was not sorry for it . That clumsy clown , spoiling her dinner , not only because the food would be ruined on account of his lateness , but because he had insulted them all by his loud clothes and his tipsy talk ! She understood now why Russell Forbes and Homer Lathrop and other men she knew so despised and hated the Irish . She had been prepared to like Brian for Roger 's sake , she had even told her bridegroom on their wedding day that she did like this " flannelmouthed Mick . " It had been a colossal lie . . . . She did not blame Caroline for sitting so rigidly beside him , turning her head away . Emily would have done the same in her sister-in-law 's place . But Brian Collins appeared quite undisturbed by Caroline 's avoidance ; indeed , he seemed to have found such a kindred spirit in Mrs. Putnam that he had promptly dismissed Caroline from his mind . During the long wait for his arrival , Mrs. Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in top form . Nothing had happened to the soup ; Deirdre had not been defeated there by Brian Collins . The clear green turtle was strong and hot , perfectlyseasoned  --  and perfectly served . Now that Ellie had Dolly with her , she was more like herself again , as Emily had hoped she would be . Emily looked down toward the other end of the table , beyond the flowers and the silver birds and the tall epergne with its overhanging fruit , and saw that Roger and Marion were chatting quietly and contentedly . Priscilla and David were also getting on very well . Conscientiously , Emily applied herself to Mr. Putnam , leaving Pell free for Caroline . But the generous gesture was wasted . Caroline was now so obviously affronted that she would not talk to anyone . When the vol-au-vent of sea food came in , as unspoiled as the soup and complemented by Homer Lathrop 's excellent Chablis , Emily relaxed a little and turned to Pell , giving voice to the bewildermentwhich had plagued her for so long . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know , I have the strangest feeling that I 've seen you before . " " But you did . At your wedding . " " No , I mean before that . It puzzled me when I saw you that day too . I 've kept wondering about it . I 'm annoyed with myself because I ca n't remember when and where it was . " 8o " Then I must put an end to your annoyance . It is not suitable that lovely ladies should be annoyed , especially without reason . You saw me Christmas Eve , on Louisburg Square . I saw you too . " " Christmas Eve  --  " " Yes . You were waiting for someone , I imagine  --  was it perhaps Roger ? I think it must have been , for I saw him later too on Joy Street , near this very house . At all events , you were standing in the bay window of your grandmother 's drawing room , beside a big Christmas tree . You had on a golden-brown velvet dress and you looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look very beautiful . " Pellegrino made the remark about her beauty in the same calm , dispassionateway that he had said everything else as he helped himself to the overdone duck . So spoken , the words did not constitute a compliment , only a statement of fact . Emily realized this ; nevertheless , she colored with pleasure . Of course , Roger had told her many times that she was beautiful , but that was because he was in love with her , which gave the declarationvalue , but no authenticity . If Pellegrino de Lucca thought she was beautiful , she really must be  --  a conclusion far from displeasing . Moreover , Roger expressed such appreciation only in moments of intimacy , when he and she were alone . He never could have made such a statement as Pellegrino 's in the course of dinner party small talk ; it would have caused him to feel shy and self-conscious even to try . " Why , I was standing in Grandmamma 's window waiting for Roger ! " she said , tasting the duck which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pommard could not redeem it . She decided that perhaps it would be better to make no direct rejoinder to Pellegrino 's final remark , much as she wished that she could have spoken in the same natural way that he did about her looks . Besides , her curiosity was still only half satisfied . " But where in the world were you ? " she asked impulsively . " Outside , in the street . With a group of my friends . We stopped beside the steps of your grandmother 's house to sing . I think it was Adeste Fideles we sang there . " " Adeste Fideles ! Of course ! Then you were  --  " She checked herself suddenly . She could not say , " You were the man who made me think of Michelangelo 's David , because you were so strikingly handsome . " Yet the statement would have been no more candid and direct than the one he had just made about her beauty . Neither could she say , " I kept noticing the snowflakes on your hair , " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that the incident was recalled , she rememberedthose glistening crystals and those glossy curls very vividly . Pellegrino'shair was much more closely cut now ; it still turned up crisply at the edges , but the curls were gone . Probably someone at the office had dropped a hint . . . . Yes , and she remembered what Homer Lathrop had said , " Some of those worthless Italians from St. Leonard 's ! " Illogically , Sisince she was now more than prepared to agree with Homer about Brian , she wondered whether her trustee would still think Pellegrino worthless , since the young Italian had been taken into one of the best law firms in Boston after winning an eviction suit brought against the relatives with whom he lived . Then , perhaps the girl who had been with him on ChristmasEve , that lovely , lovely girl whom he had kissed , was just a relative , someone he took for granted , though it certainly had not looked that way . " You were the song leader , " Emily continued , rather lamely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember it all perfectly . " " Well then , you do not need to keep searching your memory or to be perplexed any longer . The puzzle is solved . " He smiled and half turned toward Caroline on his other side . Evidently he considered the reminiscence closed . Emily was not yet ready to do so , however . The salad had come in and there was no souffle with it . Deirdre 's cheese souffles were really something out of this world , and now they must forego one , all on account of that unspeakable Irishman , who was guffawingat that very moment , oblivious of all the damage he had done or unconcernedby it . To be sure , Deirdre had shown great presence of mind . She had substituted pate de foie gras and it was excellent . But that in no way exonerated Brian Collins . " I remember both you and your song very well now , " she said . " It was terribly stupid of me not to place you before . I do n't see why I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no reason why you should have , " he said quietly . " After all , you saw dozens  --  probably hundreds  --  ofstreet singers that night . And you were n't really paying much attention to them anyway . You were watching for Roger and your thoughts were on him . It was different in my case . I did not see dozens of beautiful girls dressed in golden-brown velvet , standing in bay windows beside Christmas trees . The vision of you was unique . " " But you had a very beautiful girl with you ! I remember her perfectly too ! " Even before she finished speaking , Emily realized that Pellegrino 's pleasant expression was becoming vague . He shook his head slightly , as if it were his memory which was now playing tricks . " There were five or six girls in our group that night , as I recall it , and probably they were all pretty . It seems to be quite a habit with young Italian girls . I would n't know which one you mean . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than pretty ! And be-sides  --  " Again Emily checked herself . She could not say , " And besides , you had your arm around her all the time . Besides , she put up her hands to stroke your cheek , and when she dropped her shawl , you picked it up and wrapped it tenderly around her again . Besides , you and she kissed each other . " As a matter of fact , she could not say anything , for the simple reason that Pellegrino had put a conclusive stop to their unfinished con-8versation by turning wholly away from her and beginning one with Caroline , who was no longer able to remain withdrawn in the face of his quiet persistence . But Mr. Putnam was hopeless . Across the void created by his silence , Emily listened to David and Priscilla . " I do n't know the first thing about raising cranberries , Tell me . " " Well , a cranberry bog is n't really wet  --  that is , not most of the time . " " Is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters have been released from the reservoirs to overflow the ditches . After that , of course you ca n't tell a bog from a pond until spring . But the cranberries are there , all safe , under-neath . " " I 'd like very much to come and see your bogs . " " Oh , would you really ? You mean , when we 're harvesting next fall ? It is something of a sight then , with the men moving along among the bright green vines , on their knees , with their scoops in front of them , and the red berries tumbling over each other until the scoops are full . " " Do I really have to wait until next fall for an invitation ? I thought maybe you 'd ask me down for Thanksgiving dinner this year and let me help make the cranberry sauce . " Well , that combination at least was working out better than Emily had even dared to hope . David , who was so brilliant himself , was not talking down to Priscilla ; in the kindest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , was the best possible way of revealing how brilliant he was . The champagne was bubbling up in the glasses now and the " rock rice " with hot raspberry sauce , a super ice cream which was one of Deirdre 's own inventions , was being passed . In another ten minutes , Emily would be able to give the signal to leave the table , and this time she would lead the way straight into the drawing room , shepherding Mrs. Putnam  --  who was now as drunk as Brian  --  Caroline , Marion and Priscilla along with her , and quickly admonishing Roger to keep the men in the library as long as he could . But before Ellie and Dolly were halfway around the table , Mrs. Putnam 's booming tones sounded through the pleasant , expectant hush which had followed the complimentary reception of Deirdre 's piece de resistance . " Who do you suppose I ran into on the Square the other night , Em'ly ? That scoundrelly antique dealer , Morris Brucker ! And what do you think he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been having dinner with your grandmother ! " " But he had . They 're old friends . He came over from New York on purpose to see her . " Emily spoke with a calmness that was no less effective because it was forced . David , who had looked up at the mention of his stepfather 's name , now turned quietly back to Priscilla . But the pleasant hush had suddenly become a strained silence . Then Mrs. Putnam laughed . " Well , do excuse me ! Of course I did n't know . I used to spend a lot of8 ; money with Brucker myself , when he first opened up that fancy shop of his in New York  --  not that I ever knew him socially . I stopped going to him because I found out he was a faker  --  claiming all that loot he had came right out of the Czar 's palace ! Some of it may have , but if it did , I bet he stole it , and there was a lot of junk in with the good stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prices he asked . " " My grandmother has some of the things that came out of the Winter Palace too , Mrs. Putnam , and I can assure you  --  " " Oh , I know she did n't steal ! She had other ways of getting what she wanted  --  and how ! And maybe Brucker did n't exactly steal either . After all , I guess he 's reasonably honest  --  for a Jew . " Emily had precipitately risen and with her everyone else at the table , except Mrs. Putnam and Brian . David was still talking quietly to Priscilla when Caroline , with a frozen expression , accepted Pell 's arm and Roger offered his to Marion . Mr. Putnam , oblivious to his hostess , plunged in the direction of his wife , reaching her side just as Brian seized her by the shoulder . " Shut your trap ! " he shouted . " You think I 'm going to let you sit there and insult my friends ? I can tell you that old Forbes gal may have had her moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something else : David 's dad is as straight as they come and his money 's a lot cleaner than yours . I know , see ? You 'd better take my word for it and say you 're sorry ! " 84Chapter 8 ir . THE HORRIBLE FAILURE of her first party was not only a severe blow to Emily 's pride , it was a source of very genuine distress to her , on Roger 's account . She had never doubted her ability to be helpful to him , and she visualized this helpfulness in terms of tact toward his associates quite as much as in terms of tenderness toward himself . Yet her savoir-faire had not sufficed to save the dinner from disaster . With a dexterity which suggested previous practice , Mr. Putnam had managed to get his wife out of the house before Brian 's outburst could result in a serious altercation ; Pell was similarly successful in dealing with Brian . Immediately after their removal , Caroline remarked cuttingly to Roger that of course it would be unthinkable for her and Marion to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marion tried to soften the statement with gentler excuses , it was obvious that she was also glad to escape . Neither Roger nor Emily made any effort to detain them ; and with the group reduced to David , Priscilla and their hosts , the tension in the atmosphere slackened . David glanced at his watch . " It seems to be a little on the late side for a show , " he said , as casually as if there had been some previous question of going to one . " But what about dancing for a while ? We 'd hit it just about right at the Copley . " The suggestion proved a godsend . The festive atmosphere of the ballroomat the Copley Plaza precluded any sort of serious conversation ; and , by the time they finally started home , they were all much too tired for any . David said good night at the door of the Joy Street house , after suggesting to Priscilla that he might take her to a matinee the following afternoon and drive her back to the Cape afterward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted with mingled shyness and astonishment , not untinged with delight . Then , as if fearful that either Roger or Emily might try to dissuade her from going out unchaperoned with a comparative stranger , she bolted to her room and stubbornly remainedthere . When they reached the threshold of their bedroom , Roger and Emily paused , by mutual impulse , and put their arms around each other , saying almost the same thing at almost the same time. 8 " Let 's not try to talk about it until morning , darling . " Secretly , each thought that morning would not be a good time either , because Roger would have to hurry off to the office and Emily would still be drowsy ; and secretly , each was glad that this was so : the longer the evil moment could be put off , the better . After Roger had left , Emily tried to go back to sleep and had almost succeeded when Deirdre appeared , staggering under the weight of an enormous azalea plant , which she claimed , not without reason , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang around until Emily had read the attached note from Mrs. Putnam , who was just too sorry for words that she had made such an awful break the night before . Of course she never dreamed that Morris Brucker was any relation to David Salomont , who was most attractive . In fact , she never dreamed that David was a Jew . She did n't think anyone would , if it were n't for his name , and she had n't caught that . Even if she had , she might not have recognized it as Jewish , because all the Jews she had ever heard of were named Cohen or Levy or something like that . Jasper said that Salomont was a very fine old Portuguese name , but just the same she thought David ought to change it , the way so many Jews did . Then he 'd be invited everywhere . And anyway , she was going to ask him to dinner at her house and make up for her awful faux pas . Naturally , she would expect the Fields , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . And she was most affectionately . . . . Emily tore the note into small pieces and tossed them into the scrap basket . " There is n't any message , " she said . " You need n't wait , Deirdre . And , if it is n't too heavy for you , take that hideous plant to the kitchen . " " Sure and it 's a fine , handsome plant , Mrs. Field . Why would n't you be wanting it yourself ? " " I do n't , that 's all , " Emily said , speaking a little sharply to Deirdre for the first time . " And by the way , if Mrs. Putnam calls up , say I 'm not at home . Tell Ellie that 's what she 's to do too . And do n't disturb me again . I 'm trying to get some sleep . I do n't feel well . " Deirdre departed , bearing the plant and sniffing slightly . It was clear to her that this was no time to argue with the lady of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " offer up " her alleged indisposition . Emily did not go back to sleep , but she lay still for some time , dwelling resentfully on the showy plant and the tactless note ; simultaneously , with feminine inconsistency , she told herself that if Brian Collins had been possessed of a single saving grace , he would have sent her some token of apology . Eventually , conscious of her lack of logic , and slightly amused at it , she dismissed both offenders from her mind and settled down to hard thinkingalong more objective lines . Obviously , dinner parties were not the best means of bringing alien elements harmoniously together ; it would be folly to attempt anything more along the same line . On the other hand , she could not admit herself beaten after her first attempt to make the house on Joy Street a center of good feeling and a place where better under-86standing could be promoted . She must keep on trying until she had found the right solution for the problem , and she wanted to find it for herself , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took as a matter of course seemed to furnish the best opportunities for reflection . During the beautiful days of Indian summer , she frequently cut across the Common to the Public Garden and , sitting down near the little lake , where she and Roger had ridden on the swan boats together when they were children , deliberated the questions which troubled her . The crowds that thronged the Garden did not distract her ; their character had changed very little through the years and she took their presence for granted . Gradually she realized , however , that there were fewer and fewer people crossing the bridge and wandering along the gravel walks , fewer still reading and resting on the park benches . The men who sold balloons and pinwheels had disappeared , the swan boats had stopped running , the fountains no longer played and the flower beds were covered with burlap . The babies in the perambulators , wheeled by smartly caped nurses , were so bundled up that only the tips of their noses were visible between their woolly bonnets and their knitted blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilled look which their prim headdressesaccentuated . Chilled herself , Emily abandoned the Garden . After that , she most frequently walked along the crest of the Hill to Louisburg Square , going by Mount Vernon or Chestnut Street and returningby Pinckney , for no better reason than the vague feeling that this was the natural way to proceed . Nothing on any of these streets interested her particularly ; their attributes  --  the big gray stone church , the large buildings which served as headquarters for various important organizations , the fine old houses still occupied by private families and those of less prosperous appearance which were divided into apartments or let , room by room , to transient lodgers  --  had the same elements of familiarity as those of the Public Garden , without the latter 's appeal to her . Several of the fine old houses belonged to friends of hers , and she knew they would welcome her at any time she cared to drop in ; but she was not in the mood for general visiting . She did go , occasionally , to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Forbes more easily than in her mother , the fact that such a confidence would have been an admission of failure , instead of a revelation of success , kept her silent on the subject of her problems . She wanted to wait until she could speak not only candidly , but pridefully . More than once when she had started out with Old Mrs. Forbes ' house as her intended destination , she went instead to the chapel in St. Margaret 's Convent ; but somehow Homer Lathrop 's cynical remark to the effect that he hoped she was not " seriously interested in religion , " that such an interest was " just a passing phase , " which almost every girl went through , kept coming , unbidden , to the forefront of her consciousness . If the sensation of peace and the seeming awareness of Divinity which came to her almost instantly after she entered the chapel , 87tranquilizing her and uplifting her as long as she remained there , were only part of a " passing phase " she could not depend on them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanence and reality ; but her faith in them had been undermined and she could not . One morning , when she was leaving the chapel , she did so with the sorrowful knowledge that she was not going back there unless and until her doubts about the validity of her feeling for it had been stilled . Since the one time when her curiosity about Pell had taken her over the crest of the Hill , Emily had never again surveyed the northern slope of Joy Street ; she had felt afterward as if she had been too inquisitive and was slightly ashamed of this . Pell 's noncommittal answers on the night of dinner had increased her conviction that she should not pry into his privatelife , however much this intrigued her . But the day after her decision about the chapel , having hesitated for a moment as to the direction she should take for her constitutional , she started down the unfamiliar thoroughfare . In most ways , it seemed just the same as it had been before : there were still lines of dingy laundry flapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fire escapes were still cluttered with rubbish and the garbage cans still stood , unemptied , on the corners . But the district was now unredeemed even by the evidences of neighborliness which had given it some stray aspects of cheer when she had seen it the first time . There were no more men sitting in their shirt sleeves beside open doorways , passing the time of day with each other , no more women leaning out of upper-story windows and gossiping , in a leisurely manner , with other women , leaning out of other windows . It was too cold for that now . Traffic was heavy and trucks , taxicabs and delivery wagons impeded each other 's progress as they swarmed down the Hill , the drivers honking their horns and shouting and swearing at each other . The battered brick sidewalks were crowded , too , by pedestrians for the most part laden with heavy bundles or miscellaneous small packages , who seemed to have caught the feeling of urgency from the drivers , and who pushed and panted as they went along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the locality ; only the children playing with their rubber balls in the concrete courtyard which separated the Peter Faneuil School from the street seemed to belong there . Emily stopped by the iron railing which served as a fence for the yard and watched these children . Evidently it was recess time , but they did not seem to be taking advantage of this to play any real games ; they simply bounced their rubber balls , caught them , and bounced them again . Sometimesa ball , thrown with unusual force or revealing unexpected resiliency , soared beyond a child 's reach . Then he pursued it . But he entered into no competition with his fellows , he kept no score of his successes ; he merely went on and on , futilely bouncing his ball . While Emily stood wondering what profit or pleasure there could be in such a pastime , a ball skimmed over the iron railing , struck the uneven88pavement and rebounded into the crowded street . Before it had touched the sidewalk , a little boy rushed through the gate after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to prevent the second bound . He leaped from the curb and darted directly in front of a plumber 's truck . Above the wail of locked brakes and screaming tires , there was a loud shout , followed by lesser cries and by the honking of horns . Then the tumult ended abruptly in terrible silence . The child had been struck , but not run over ; he lay on his side and from underneath his head a tiny stream of blood trickled slowly over the pavement . Emily reached the small , limp form at the same moment that the driver jumped down from his seat . The silence had ended as abruptly as the tumult and there was confusion of sound again . Emily , with her horrifiedgaze on the prostrate child , was dimly aware of another girl kneeling beside her and of two tall , blue-clad figures looming directly behind her ; then of a single voice of authority in the midst of the babel . " Do n't touch that kid , any of you . We 'll have First Aid here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Jim , get through a call for an ambulance on the double and put one of the other boys at the corner to untangle this traffic jam . And let 's have less noise around here . Stand back there , every one of you , except the driver and these two . Now let 's see your license , bud . " The driver thrust a shaking hand into his hip pocket and from this extracted a worn wallet which he opened with fumbling fingers . While the policeman inspected the proffered license , the frightened truckman jabbered excitedly . " Jeez , officer , I just turned into Joy from Myrtle , I was still in second . Brakes okay too , or I could n't have stopped like I did . But that kid come out in front of me from nowhere . " " That 's true , officer . The little boy was running after his ball . " Emily had turned from the child to look up at the remaining policeman . He answered her tersely . " You saw it happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was standing by the fence , watching the children play , " she replied quickly , without even noticing that he had called her by name . " This little boy ran right in front of me , so close that I tried to catch hold of him . I could n't , he went so fast . But do you mind if I take a look at him ? I 've had some experience in nursing . " " One of them Gray Ladies ? " The question was contemptuous . " No . Nurse 's Aide and Frontier Service in Kentucky . " " Okay . Go ahead . I guess you ca n't hurt him anyway . " Emily turned back to the child and put her fingers on his thin wrist . Then she gave a little cry of gladness . " I can feel his pulse . It 's slow , but it 's steady . " Another shout went up from the crowd which , though it had retreated had not dispersed and had , indeed , increased in size . The children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of recess , and they were trying to edge forward and get a glimpse of their stricken playmate , Two or three plainly clad , bespectacled teachers , conscientious and troubled , were trying to restrain these unruly youngsters and , at the same time , determine for themselves the gravity of the accident . Both men and women , in various stages of dress and undress , had streamed out of the tenement houses across the way and were gesticulating frantically as they talked rapidly and disjointedly to each other in several strange tongues . The driver of the repair truck , mopping his brow , gave vent to a string of oaths expressive of thanksgiving . The policeman raised his hand . " I said less noise around here . On your way , everyone who does n't live in these parts . I still do n't want the kid moved . He may be alive all right . but that 's not saying no bones are broken . And move along , the rest of you . Except you , Mrs. Field . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " The officer was now addressing the second kneeling girl . With her hand still on the little boy 's wrist , Emily turned again and again she gave a little cry , this time one of surprise . She had been slow to identify Pell , but now recognition was immediate : the girl beside her was the same one who had been with him on Christmas Eve . There was no mistaking that rare , madonnalike type of ; beauty .. . . " No , not everything from close by , like the lady here , " the Italian girl was saying , speaking rather haltingly . She had a sweet voice , but she spoke with a strong accent and it was evident that she had to grope for the right words . " I was standing at the window . I live right there , across the street . " She motioned in the direction of a tenement house and once more Emily was struck with the grace of her movements . " I know the driver is telling the truth . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ball and  --  " " You the kid 's sister ? " " No , he 's not a relation . But  --  " " You went through the crowd like you 'd been shot out of a gun . If I had n't ' a thought you was his sister or something , I would n't ' a let you stay . What 's the rest of his name ? " " Danielli . And please let me stay , even if he is n't a relation . I know him very well . His mother is our neighbor . She goes out to work , so we try to help her take care of him . " " Who 's ' we ' ? " My mother and my brother and myself . Pietro 's mother will think we did not take good care of him this time and . . . . Could n't I please put my shawl over him at least ? It 's so cold and he 's so little . " The girl 's sweet voice ended in a low sob . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea . And look , he ai n't dead . He ai n't even bleedingany more . And kids like him has got nine lives anyway . At that , I guess I 'd better take your name as a witness of the accident . What is it ? I know your address already . " 90 " Simonetta de Lucca . " She was absorbed in arranging her shabby shawl so that it would cover Pietro as completely as possible . She did not even look at the officer as she answered . " Simon  --  you 'd better spell it . " She glanced up and tried , docilely enough , to do as she was told . But the letters of the unfamiliar alphabet came so slowly and indistinctly from her lips that the officer had difficulty in following them . The pencil with which he was writing in a small book moved more and more slowly and then came to a stop . " Perhaps I can help , " suggested Emily . " S-i-m-o-n-e-t-t-a d-e L-u-c-c-a . That 's right , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you very much , lady . " Evidently Simonetta felt no astonishment because her name was known to a passer-by and no curiosity as to how this happened . Her passive acceptance of the fact struck Emily as strange until she realized she had hitherto accepted the officer 's recognition of herself in almost the same matter-of-course way and that she was no longer inclined to do so . " Would you need to use my name too ? " she inquired as casually as possible . " Could be . But of course I knew that already : M. Roger Field , and I know your Joy Street address too . No reason why you should remember me . In case it would be handy for you to get in touch with me later on though , I 'm Tupperty , Tim ' Pupperty . . . . Well , have a look here now , will you ? " Emily and Simonetta both followed the direction of the officer 's pointingfinger . The little boy whom they had , momentarily , ceased to watch with the same closeness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no indication of pain . After first moving his shoulders slightly , he flung out his arms and drew up his legs , turning restlessly from side to side , as if he found the pavement uncomfortable . Then he opened his eyes and looked up into Simonetta 's face , putting his hand to his head as he did so . " What happened ? " he asked in a puzzled whisper . " You ran after your ball , caro , and you forgot to take care . A truck was coming and it hit you . " " But I 'm all right now , except my head hurts a little . " As if to prove that what he said was true , Pietro pushed away the shawl and tried to sit up . Officer Tupperty put a restraining hand on his shoulder . " Not so fast there . It 's a fine scare you 've given us all and I 'm not so sure that we 're out of the woods yet , but there 's the ambulance coming now and we 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his final words and the crowd scattered as the ambulance tore down the Hill and came to an abrupt stop. 91Two policemen leaped from it , nodded to Tim Tupperty and , bending over Pietro , inspected the cut on the child 's head . " Just a surface wound , " one of them said encouragingly . " A touch of Mercurochrome and a bit of Band-aid will fix that up in no time . Do n't worry , sonny . It wo n't hurt you none . But we 're going to take you along with us , see , just to make sure there 's nothing else wrong . " " Where to ? " " Over to M. G. H. , right around the corner . You 'll like it there . " For the first time , Pietro 's under lip quivered and again he looked appealingly at Simonetta . " Ca n't I go home with you , Etta ? You could take care of me . " " I could try , taro . But I think perhaps this time I should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will let me go with Pietro to the hospital , will you not , signori ? " " The kid 's mother works out , " Tim Tupperty said in an undertone . " This girl and her family look after him . " The officer , who had finished putting the Band-aid neatly into place and , with his companion 's help , taken a stretcher from the ambulance , nodded again . " Sure . She can go along . Now , if you 'll just lie still , sonny , me and Ned 'll roll you over on this nice little number and we 'll get going . " " Could n't I go to the hospital too , Mr. Tupperty ? I 'd like to be of some help if I could . " " And say , officer , now that we know the kid ai n't hurt bad , could n't I get going too ? There 's a big leak in the house where I was headed and the whole place 'll be flooded if I do n't fix it pretty damn soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plumber first . " Okay . I can always get hold of you if I want to . Just wait for the ambulanceto clear . . . . You could n't do anything if you did go to the hospital , Mrs. Field . Probably they would n't even let you see the kid . This De Lucca girl , she 's different  --  like his own folks , you might say , even if they are n't really related . " The ambulance shot off , making the same shrill sound with which it had approached , and less noisily , but almost as speedily , the repair truck followed down the Hill . As she walked away in the opposite direction , Emily was conscious of curious glances and whispered comments from the onlookers who still lingered in the street . However , nobody spoke to her and she went home feeling not only shaken , but rebuffed . The incident added to her general state of unrest . The next day she went to the hospital , where the receptionist received her coldly , and told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the patients , except to members of their immediate family . The following week she went to the tenement house where the De Luccas and the Daniellis lived , but there was no answer at the Daniellis ' flat , and the middle-aged woman who answered92her ring at the De Luccas ' either spoke practically no English or pretended that this was the case . Eventually , Simonetta appeared , apologetically . She was sorry she had not been able to come to the door immediately herself , she said , but she had just gone out on the fire escape to bring in the laundry . Yes , Pietro was doing very well  --  in fact , he had already left the hospital and was back in school . The X rays had revealed no broken bones and the cut on his head was healing rapidly . It was very kind of the lady to inquire , but no , he needed nothing . She spoke with the utmost politeness , but she did not ask Emily to come in and there was a certain unmistakable finality in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pietro and to wish she could do something to improve his lot . The fact that he had escaped injury once did not mean he would always do so , unless the conditions under which he lived changed for the better ; and these were no worse than the conditions under which dozens  --  hundreds  --  of other children dwelt , who were her neighbors . If Simonetta would have accepted her as a friend , she might have found a way of reaching out to these children ; but Simonetta , in spite of her grave courtesy , had made it very clear that she did not wish to continue the chance acquaintance . Emily thought of appealing to Pell , but was prevented by pride . After all , there was a limit to the number of rebuffs she could accept . Nevertheless , Simonetta herself had become an increasingly enigmatic figure and as such , an increasingly provocative one . Dc Lucca was not a common name among the Italians of Boston and , in any event , Emily knew that Pell lived with relatives . Simonetta had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been referring to Pell when she did this  --  or at least , so Emily persistently told herself . Conceivably , he and Simonetta might be cousins , brought up like brother and sister , though there had been nothing to suggest such an unromantic relationship in their attitude toward each other . To be sure , marriages between cousins were by no means rare among the old Boston families ; but such marriages did not occur , as far as Emily knew , either between young men and young girls who had lived all their lives under the same parental roof , or between young men and young girls who loved each other so passionately that they embraced , with abandon , on the street  --  and still went unwed , year after year . Yet Pell and Simonetta were doing.both these things . It was puzzling , it was shocking , it was almost abnormal  --  at least , it was certainly puzzling , and it would have seemed both shocking and abnormal were it not for the inescapably spiritual quality in the beauty of the two young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less depravity , with either Pell or Simonetta . . . . There remained Tim Tupperty , whom Emily could have dismissed easily enough from her mind if it had not been for his connection with Brian Collins . In that case , there was no question about the relationship ; the two proudly proclaimed themselves cousins and they were boon corn-93panions to boot . They drank and gambled together ; probably they did worse , to each other 's ribald amusement . Tim Tupperty doubtless owed his position on the police force to some form of political graft , or else profited by this position to practice graft himself . And what was true of ' Tim Tupperty must be correlatively true of Brian Collins . His connection with the firm of Cutter , Mills and Swan must be due to favors received ; and he must be taking advantage of the freedom from suspicion which the firm gave him to line his own pockets and those of his innumerable relatives . Emily despised him and she could not understand why she did not stop thinking about him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned . She did not want Brian for a friend and Pell did not want to be hers . Only David was friendly and he did not need her friendship ; she had never met anyoneso self-assured and so self-satisfied . It was all very puzzling . She was sorry she had decided never to return to St. Margaret 's Chapel . Whatever Homer Lathrop thought , she could not help feeling that if she had gone there long enough , she might have found understanding and wisdom as well as peace . Chapter 9ONLY ONE PERSON gauged the degree of Emily 's distress or guessed some of the reasons for it . Emily 's parents had continued to make their headquarters in Dublin throughout the autumn , so the " horrible little Gloucester Street house " was still unopened and unoccupied ; and , in any case , Emily had never felt sufficiently close to her mother to confide in her easily , nor had Eleanor Thayer ever revealed much initiative in regard to her daughter 's problems . But Old Mrs. Forbes , with a mercy she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the girl 's perturbed state of mind , adroitly sought to divert Emily 's thoughts . " What are you doing about the first Waltz Evening ? " she inquired when the two were lunching together , without guests , according to their not infrequent custom . " I do n't know . I had n't thought much about it . The invitation only came this morning . " " Then you have n't made any plans for dinner beforehand ? " " No . I do n't seem to be in just the right mood for giving dinners . " " No one expects a bride to keep giving dinners all the time , or to devote herself exclusively to philanthropy . People in your set ought to be giving dinners for you . Naturally , your father and mother ca n't do anything , as long as they unreasonably stay on in the country and , even if they were here , they could n't do much in that horrible little Gloucester Street house ; what 's more , I do n't want to foster the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lathrop gives very nice dinners at the Somerset Club , as you must remember . The food 's very creditable there . Of course , those private dining rooms on the second floor are about the last word in gloom , but they do have a certain cachet . I think it would be highly suitable for Homer to give a small party at the Somerset Club before the first Waltz Evening . " " I hope you wo n't suggest it to him if he does n't come across of his own accord . " " Why not ? Will you please tell me , Emily Field , how there could be a9better time to make suggestions to a thoughtless man than when he does n't do anything on his own initiative ? " Emily laughed , and when she did so , some of the strain within her eased . But , as she reached for a cigarette , without making any immediate answer , her grandmother asked her another question , meanwhile twisting around the signet ring which she now wore constantly . " There is n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in dancing ? A reason that you thought you might tell me two or three months from now when there would n't be any need of it ? In other words , to quote Maurice Hewlett , I hope you 'll proclaim your condition before your condition proclaims you . " " I would , if there were anything to proclaim . But there is n't , I 'm sorry to say . " To her intense chagrin , Emily blushed as she spoke . Her grandmother . observing her critically , realized that the girl 's annoyance over the failure of a dinner party did not wholly account for her perturbed state of mind ; she was acutely disappointed because there was , as yet , no prospect of a child . " Well , do n't talk as if you were verging on change of life , " Old Mrs. Forbes said briskly . " After all , you 're only twenty-two and you have n't been married six months yet . Most brides are very thankful when things turn out this way . In fact , nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do . " " I know . But I was n't . I 'm not . Roger and I want children  --  several children . And when husband and wife both feel like that , do n't you think it 's  --  well , reassuring if  --  if  --  " She was not only blushing now , her voice was trembling too . She reached for a glass of water and found that her hand was shaking . " If a girl begins to lose her breakfast before she 's home from her weddingtrip ? " Old Mrs. Forbes inquired tartly , so that Emily would think she had not noticed . " Why yes , I suppose it is reassuring . ' But it certainly does n't add to the glamour of the situation . " " I 'd rather have the reassurance than the glamour . And some girls never lose their breakfast . Somehow , I do n't believe you did , Grandmamma . " She was speaking and acting more naturally again , Old Mrs. Forbes observed with relief . She was distressed herself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to make anyone believe it , and indeed would not have wished anyone to do so . Her relief increased as Emily went on talking more and more normally . " I 'll call up Uncle Homer myself . I was going to anyway . I need some more money . That 's the worst of a spring trousseau  --  it does n't provide for things like fur coats and my old one is a sight . It would n't ever do to wear for a Waltz Evening . Thanks , Grandmamma , for the lunch  --  and the good advice  --  all you gave me and all you did n't . I do n't know which I appreciated more . " 96Homer Lathrop put no obstacles in the way of a new fur coat , even when Emily told him she thought it had better be mink this time  --  mink was so practical , you could wear it for anything and everything . Moreover , he was most receptive to the suggestion of a dinner at the Somerset Club before the first Waltz Evening  --  his only regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as of course he should have done . They discussed a guest list , first over the telephone and then over a cup of tea . Roger , coming in from the office even later than usual , found them deep in a conversation into which he entered himself without much spirit . He too had been troubled by the fiasco of the first little party ; and the fact that he had found it difficult to discuss this with Emily added to his distress . He had supposed that they would always talk everything over freely ; that such discussions would not only result in a solution of problems , but in closer and closer communion . Yet nothing had been solved in regard to his relations with his fellow juniors , and suddenly Emily seemed remote from him , as she sat there talking with Homer Lathrop on a subject , which , because of his lateness , required explanation before he could enter into the conversation at all . He was very tired , he was not in the mood to welcome a guest  --  above all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not want  --  to go to dinner at the Somerset Club and he had always detested the Waltz Evenings . But he could not put these feelings into words . Instead , he had to say it was very kind of Mr. Lathrop , that he was most appreciative and that he thought a Waltz Evening would be just the right occasion for Emily to christen a new mink coat . ( A coat which he was not buying for her , the sort of coat he probably never could buy for her . ) If he had not felt so uneasy about his progress at the office , his mood might well have been different , or he might have been able to throw this off on his return to a comfortable home and a cheerful wife . But , day after day , he was dispatched on errands , charged with delivering or filing papers which he thought could just as well have been mailed , and sent to look up information which , in many instances , he could have obtained more easily and quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some trips were more or less invented to occupy him . Most of his time in the office was spent in looking up doubtful points of law , and when he had finished with these , they appeared no less doubtful than when he had begun . He was allowed to write letters demanding the payment of overdue accounts , to draft simple contracts and to prepare briefs . But none of his drafts was accepted as a finished product and none of his work was creative . His feeling of frustration was intensified by the general atmosphere of the office . Instead of finding this stimulating , he found it disheartening . Everything about it seemed oppressive , from its physical attributes to the rigid protocol by which the three seniors , the two partners whose names did not yet appear in that of the firm and the four juniors were firmly placed above and below the salt . It was logical , of course , that Mr. Cutter97and Mr. Mills should have fine corner offices , with windows on two sides , and that Mr. Swan , who came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though less light and airy , between the two ; also that Elliot Berkeley and Cyrus Fletcher , the two subordinate partners , should have the benefit of daylight , even though the library and the conference room , which were on the same open side of the building , necessarily left them somewhat cramped . But it seemed to Roger that somehow it should have been possible to redeem the cubicles occupied by the juniors and the clerical staff from the same stuffy gloom which pervaded the long central corridor into which all the individual rooms led , beyond the elevators , the switchboard and the small reception hall . A fresh breeze blowing through , a square of sunlight on his desk , would have worked wonders for his morale . So would a word from one of his superiors to the effect that it was a matter of regret that they did not have more to offer their juniors in the way of creature comfort , but that plans for the future included improvementalong those lines , in keeping with their general policy of progressiveness . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no compensations , nor was there anything especially progressiveabout the general policy of the firm , as far as Roger had been able to discover . Neither had he found much evidence of those " idealistic standards " about which he had heard so much beforehand ; and nothing he had heard or seen had helped him to overcome his depression and sense of futility . As a matter of fact , he still felt as if he hardly knew the senior partner , who came in on a late train from Chestnut Hill every morning , and left early , at least three afternoons in the week , to go rowing from the Union Boat Club . Roscoe Cutter was a big man , with abundant iron-gray hair and a ruddy countenance , who spoke in a loud voice and bore himself like a motion picture actor cast as a ship 's captain . Almost everyone in the office was afraid of him and he was not above taking advantage of this fear to achieve desired results from his subordinates . But his blustering manner took on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom he was always hail-fellow-well-met and never the big bully ; while among the boon companions with whom he regularly rowed were the most important of these clients . The only time he had summoned Roger to his office , he had been preoccupied with adding coal to the fire , which he kept burning brightly under a stone mantel decorated with a heraldic design . This fireplace , one of the few still operating in the building , was obviously a source of great pride to Mr. Cutter and it was only belatedly that he remembered he had sent for Roger to file a revised list of the Acme  --  Tool Company 's directors . Occasionally he dispatched a memorandum , which was typed and delivered by his secretary , Miss Elsie Smythe , an angular . elderly spinster . But , after dispatching such a communication , he usually forgot that too . Roger found himself thinking enviously of Bradford Olcott , a classmate who  --  as he tardily discovered  --  had been offered the job which he now QSheld himself . Brad had turned it down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had opened his own office . He had written Roger jokingly about his first case : a farmer 's wife was suing her husband for divorce because he had spanked her . The spanking , so the farmer claimed , had been administered only after his stubborn spouse had declinedto press his pants , and this was freely admitted ; but it next transpiredthat the reason the man wanted his pants pressed was because he was taking the hired girl to a chicken pie supper at Odd Fellow 's Hall ! Roger had smiled rather ruefully when he first read this letter and he had reread it a number of times . Obviously , Brad 's first case had been humorous rather than rewarding ; but it was his own case and he had won it . He had not spent all his time acting as someone 's errand boy or poring over old statutes in books which were , literally , as dry as dust . And it might be twenty below zero in Vergennes , but the air had a sparkle as well as a sting to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger , who was seeking to resolve an intricate point in a minor bankruptcy case for Mr. Mills , found his thoughts straying from the dull subject to dwell with increasing envy on Bradford Olcott 's invigorating freedom . If he had only come to regard Mr. Mills himself with more respect , Roger would have been less prone to such mental insubordination . But he had found absolutely nothing to admire in the evasive character of this plausibleand pretentious attorney . He resented the frequent absences of Mr. Mills on unexplained business trips and the cavalier fashion in which he shunted the detail work of his own cases onto the desks of the hapless juniors , especially as the suits were of petty nature . Most of all , Roger resented the adroit way in which Mr. Mills assumed all the credit for such cases , when these were won by his subordinates , and shifted all the blame on them when the cases were lost . " Old Artful Dodger 's the only one who brings in chicken coop litigation , " David grumbled to Roger one day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell a penny from here to Pawtucket , so he never says no to a case , even if it 's a suit to recover the value of a cut clothesline . Then he slips the work to us . But he takes the cut of the fee for himself , because it 's business ' he brought into the firm . One of these fine days . . . . ' Recalling David 's outburst , Roger smiled faintly . He was still seeking to resolve that intricate point in a minor bankruptcy case for Mr. Mills , and the task was one on which he had already spent more than two hours , apparently without getting one whit closer to the desired goal . Unless he could achieve something definite in the way of progress within the next few minutes , he would have to stay late at the office again ; and this was the night of the first Waltz Evening , when he and Emily were to dine at the Somerset Club with Homer Lathrop ! The shrill summons of his telephonebroke in upon his mood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office , " the switchboard operator informed him. 99Roger knew exactly what would happen next . He would be chided for " devoting so much time to a simple matter of elementary practice " and asked how much longer he would require . He would then be reminded that he was not being asked to prepare a brief for the Supreme Court and told that , in Mr. Mills ' day , it was presumed that a Harvard graduate could at least look up the Index in Corpus Juris . Probably he should have asked advice from David , who was so much more quick witted and more experienced than himself , or even from Mr. Swan , the only one of the three firm members about whom Roger found nothing to resent and who had treated him kindly while regarding him somewhat absent-mindedly . Marion 's father was a scholarly , stoop-shouldered plan , perpetually in need of a haircut , who found his principal diversion in the dinners given by the Club of Odd Volumes . He was generally acknowledged as the office savant in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Amherst instead of Harvard . David called him " The Great Brass Brain " . . . . Well , it was too late to think about help from that quarter now . Roger hastily gathered together such notes as he had assembled in the bankruptcy case and , papers in hand , entered Mr. Mills ' commodious corner office . " I 'm afraid I 'll need a little more time in going over this , sir , " he began . " You see , I 've found what may involve the receipt of technical preference by our client on at least one transaction . " " Eh ? Bankruptcy ? What the devil . . . . Oh , yes , of course , to be sure , " Mills replied . " Forget that for the time being . And do n't labor it to death when you get back to it . Prepare a proof of claim and worry about the law when it comes up . Meantime , first things first . " He pulled a bound folder from the litter of papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of one bestowing largess . His pale lips parted over his yellow teeth in an ingratiating smile . " Got a real job for you , my boy . Want you to take over for me in a jury trial that comes up in Salem this very afternoon . " " But , Mr. Mills  --  " " I know , I know , " Mr. Mills admitted graciously . Having rid himself of the folder , he smoothed back his thinning hair , adjusted his costly tie , and went on with increasing fervor . " Short notice and all that sort of thing . Reason for it , though . Expected to handle the matter myself . It 's my own case , you see . Then , not ten minutes ago , Van Pick called me from Benningtonand says he must see me up there at once . Head of one of the hydroelectric companies that furnishes current to the Boston-Edison . Some sort of hitch in a subcontract that will have to be ironed out right away . Ca n't be in Bennington and Salem at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue a case before a jury this afternoon , when I 've never even heard of it until this minute , Mr. Mills ? Can we get a continuance , under the circumstances ? " " Doubt it . Trouble is , it 's been continued a couple of times already . rooLast time it was to be reached I had to leave for Philadelphia . The way it happens , sometimes . No harm asking for another continuance , of course . But afraid it wo n't be granted . ' S why I 'm counting on you to step in for us . Know you 'll give it all you 've got . . . . File right here . Study it on your way to Salem . Ca n't stop to explain . You 've got one train to catch , I 've got another . Let 's get going ! " Again Roger smiled ruefully as he left Mr. Mills ' office and strode along the corridor to his own last-and-least door . " The Artful Dodger 's a great one to give pep-talks , ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sub , called from the bench when the fullback 's been injured . To save the game and all that . . . . " Then he realized , quite abruptly , that this was it . His first jury case . His real opportunity . Better than Brad 's . The big chance . Nell , he would show them . He would show them all . . " Hello there ! What are you throwing out your chest for ? " David , who had just emerged from the elevator , looking , as usual , fresh , complacent and unhurried , regarded Roger with a tolerant smile not untingedby condescension . He had noticed the same expression on David 's face before and he had never resented it ; David had a right to his feeling of superiority . But though Roger still felt no resentment , he was slightly embarrassed , for the first time , in his friend 's presence ; evidently he gave himself away too easily . " Well , really , Dave , I was n't . . . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm only kidding . You did look rather on the exalted side , though . What 's coming off ? Anything special ? " " My first jury case . . . . This afternoon , too . Got to catch a train for Salem . " " Oh , no , not that ! Anything but that , Rog . Not the Hart thing , is it ? " Defiantly , and already fighting a feeling of deflation , Roger nodded . " So the Artful Dodger 's at it again . He 's been called out of town for some very important consultation , I 'll bet . Wanted to go up to Salem and argue this himself , but simply had to meet this other sudden appointment ? Was n't that it ? " Again Roger nodded , his feeling of deflation growing . " It 's a god-damned crime , what that gold-bricking bastard gets away with . Let me give you a quick run-down on this thing , so you 'll at least know what you 're up against . It was Pell he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a continuance . " " That 's what I thought I 'd try to do . " " I do n't think you 'd have a prayer for it . Not this time . You see this case has n't any business in the docket of a firm like ours . It 's some chap who runs a sea food restaurant , and who has n't paid his bills . He 's being sued for them . The Artful Dodger met him at the time he was putting through a lease for the restaurant . We represent the realty brokers who handle the property . When this Hart was sued , the only lawyer he could think of was our Mills , so he came up here . Instead of sending him off toro. someone who would handle that sort of thing , Mills took the case , dictateda routine answer to the declaration and then promptly forgot it . . . . Pell saved Mills ' hide once by getting a continuance , and apparently he forgot it again till this very afternoon , though it 's dollars to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of time . Now he 's dropping the hot potato in your lap . . . . Well , best of luck . But do n't take it to heart if it goes against you . You 've got three and maybe four strikes on you already . " The " exaltation " was entirely gone long before David finished ; but Roger was still grimly determined to " show ' em " when he reached the North Station , boarded the cinder-grimed local for Salem and found a seat behind a fat woman who was absorbed in a motion-picture magazine and a small boy who was greedily sucking a Hershey bar . Then he buried himself in the file , finding , the further he went into it that he had more and more cause for concern . If Mr. Mills had neglected the case , as it became increasingly clear that he had , then the defendant , Hart  --  Roger 's first client at a jury trial  --  might not even have been notified to appear in court . There would not be time to locate him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still be present when the case was reached . Momentarily , this handicap appeared to him insuperable . But , as he forced himself to study the faltering and inadequate list of payments , Roger caught what he hoped was an inspiration and scrawled a motion . on ruled white paper , hurriedly finishing a duplicate as the train slowed down at his stop . Emerging from the fantastic gray castle with which the Boston and Maine shelters its Salem tracks , Roger waited until his train , blowing steam through the station , had snortingly started up again and disappeared into the tunnel under Salem 's busiest street . Then he approached the guard who had been holding a " Stop " sign to prevent automobiles from passing in front of the engine and asked the way to the courthouse . " Go up the grade beside the tunnel and turn to the left when you come to the church . After that , you 'll see it on your right . " Hastily obeying directions , Roger found his turn , entered the gray stone courthouse and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stairs . As he had feared , he was none too soon ; the place was already sparsely occupied by scattered groups , the men in dungarees and windbreakers , the women in heavy drab coats with straggly fur collars . He had a blurred impression of white walls and a fine portrait ; then of jury seats on either side of the bench , into which , on the left , men were filing from a door beside the bench . The clerk was already at his desk , fiddling with a little barrel-shaped drum . A gray-haired , poker-faced judge in a loose black robe entered briskly and everyone stood . " Court is open . Be seated , " intoned a deputy sheriff. 102Chapter 10As ROGER UNEASILY took a seat within the rail , he looked searchingly in every direction for someone who might answer Mr. Mills ' description of his client . ' There was no such person in sight . His anxious glance next fell on the clock . Its hands pointed to three-twenty and he knew Court would sit only until four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his client , who was the only witness he could summon to testify , did not turn up , he would have to stall until the hour of adjournment came . It came as a shock to him that the outcome of his first case before a jury hinged not upon his knowledge of jurisprudence , but upon his ability to kill time . If the Court recessed before the case went to the jury and the proceedings were therefore continued until the following morning , he might have a chance of finding his client , of effecting a settlement out of court and of winning after all . " Wholesale Sea Foods Corporation against the Beverly Lobster House ! " the court clerk intoned . " Plaintiff , " promptly answered a thin , impatient-looking man in an Oxford gray suit . " Defendant , " added Roger , taking the table in front of the jury box . Plaintiff 's counsel approached Roger and offered his hand . " I 'm Fleeney , " he said . " Field , " responded Roger . " Your first time here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . " Fleeney cleared his throat . " Your Honor , " he proclaimed oratorically , so that all prospective jurymenwould hear . " May I present Mr. Field  --  of Boston . " " You gentlemen ready for trial ? " the judge inquired , after a perfunctory nod at Roger . " Yes , your Honor , " said Fleeney emphatically . " I have a motion , if your Honor please , " said Roger , " to amend the defendant 's answer by setting forth that the last payment on account constitutedan accord and satisfaction . " ro ; " Had you notified Mr. Fleeney ? " asked the judge . " No , your Honor , I must confess I drew this motion on the train , and apologize for its appearance . " " Any objection , Mr , Fleeney ? " " I do n't wish to appear unduly technical , may it please the Court , but I think this comes very late . I am ready to try the case on the present pleadings , and although I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting it or prepared for it . Surely my brother is well aware that a payment on account can not , as a matter of law , operate to extinguish an undisputed claim . " " This claim is disputed , if your Honor please , " urged Roger , " and always was . That is why we are here . If my brother should need time to assemble evidence on this point , he will probably have an opportunity to do so before tomorrow morning . " The judge sighed . " Well , all right . I 'll allow it . Witnesses all here ? " Two men and two women , who had been sitting together , rose in the rear of the room . " My client has been delayed by an important engagement , " Roger explained , the palms of his hands beginning to sweat , " but he should be here any minute . " " He certainly should , " said the judge . " Go ahead , Mr. Clerk . " The clerk handed each lawyer a typed list , whirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open a panel and pulled out a card . Roger scanned the list before him , which set forth the talesmen 's names , addresses and occupations . He realized that he could draw out the proceedings to a considerablelength by challenging some of these prospective jurors for cause . But the names were all unfamiliar to him . He could think of no reason to argue that any of the men who were being called could not render an impartial verdict . Of course , he also had the right to some peremptory challenges ; for the life of him , however , he could not remember how many . " If any of you is related to either party or has any interest in this case , or has expressed or formed an opinion , or is sensible of any bias or prejudicetherein , " the clerk was telling the prospective jurors , " you should say so now and step down . " No one said or did anything . " Plaintiff ? " asked the clerk , in a bored tone . " Content , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at the list . Number Three came from Beverly  --  he might have heard rumors about the Lobster House . " The defense challenges Number Three . " The man stepped down . Another was called and took his place . Eagerly as he desired to prolong the opening gambit , Roger decided not to offer another challenge for fear that only one was allowed . He did not want toro4reveal his ignorance of routine court procedure , even on the chance of securing further delay . If Fleeney would only make a long opening statement , as Roger earnestly hoped he might , the case might yet be put over until morning . But when the clerk handed Fleeney the sheaf of pleadings , the attorney merely rattled through the papers and almost instantly began to speak . " This is a simple case . The plaintiff sold and delivered the lobsters in question , as we will show . The defendant only partly paid for them . . . . Mr. Edgerly ! " Roger cast a dismayed glance at the clock . Fleeney 's opening had consumedno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already making his self-conscious way to the stand . However , the court clerk intervenedat this moment , halting the trial until all witnesses had been put under oath in unison . With satisfaction , Roger watched an entire minute slip by . Now he would have to think of a technical objection which could be argued at length , perhaps in connection with something that might crop up during the ensuing point counterpoint of questions and answers . " Your name ? " began Fleeney . " Stanford Edgerly . " " Your address ? " " Edgerly Building , Main Street , Beverly . " " Your business ? " " President and treasurer of Wholesale Sea Foods Corporation . " " Have you done business with the defendant , Beverly Lobster House ? " " I have . " " I show you a bundle of slips . What are these ? " " These are delivery tickets . When we get an order , it 's put on one of these , and when it 's delivered , the purchaser signs here at the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on his feet with an objection which he did not expect the Court to sustain , but which would give him an opportunity to argue at some length that the documents themselves were the best evidence of what they contained and that it therefore did not matter what this or any other witness might say was in them . He spoke hesitantly at first , but with growing assurance as he went on . It was true that Fleeney did not even accord his argument a reply , but looked inquiringly at the judge , who droned , " Overruled ! " as though bored by something unworthy of serious consideration . But Roger noted with satisfaction that the hands of the clock now stood at ten minutes of four . " Your witness , " Fleeney said casually . Roger 's fleeting moment of triumph was gone He experienced a sensation of emptiness . He would have to cross-examine Edgerly now , and if he made a good job of it , he could keep the man on the stand until well past adjournment time . But what could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost elementary recital of a few facts . Againsto ; what point of that chronicle could any attack be directed ? What was there to break down ? In something like desperation , he began to lead the witnessthrough a review of the testimony he had just given on direct examination . " You said Mr. Hart telephoned his orders for lobsters ? " " That 's right . " You said you knew and recognized his voice on the phone ? " " Yes . " " And that 's how you knew it was Mr. Hart calling ? " " That was n't the only way . He 'd usually say something like : Stan , this is Iry Hart:I 've got a mob coming here Friday night . Send me double the regular order , quick . ' " " And you wrote it down on one of these forms in Exhibit A ? " " Yes . " " And it was you who sent out the order ? " " I gave the orders , yes . " " You did n't drive the truck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the witness , pointing to the man who had been sworn with him . " So you were not present when these lobsters were delivered ? " " No . " " And you yourself did n't see Mr. Hart , or anyone else , sign a single one of those receipts introduced here , did you ? " " No , but I know his signature , like I said . " " Now there were times , were n't there , when Mr. Hart complained about the lobsters you say you sent him ? " " I do n't seem to remember any . " " You mean you are perfectly sure , testifying under oath , that there was no time when Mr. Hart in some way told you that the lobsters you sent him were not satisfactory ? " " I ca n't think of any . " The early dusk of a somber autumn day was closing in . A bailiff rose and turned on the lights . One by one , the attorneys who had been seated within the inclosure rose and tiptoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be asked to start a trial so late in the day . But Roger was aware he could still lose if he did not use every minute until four , and perhaps a little beyond , if it appeared the case could thus be closed . Looking at his file , he persisted in his efforts to break down Edgerly 's testimony . " Is n't it a fact that , on the Monday after the Fourth of July , he called you up and said he 'd been getting complaints from his customers that they 'd been sick ? " " I object ! " exclaimed Fleeney , instantly on his feet . " What 's the matter ? " asked Roger , effectively concealing his gratitude for the interruption. rob " If my brother wants to , he can prove the customers at the Lobster I-louse got sick . But , your Honor , I object to this question directed to the witness , who ca n't possibly know what made them sick , in an effort to hurt my client 's reputation here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge ; and , when they had done so , he admonished them in low tones . " I must remind you gentlemen that this sort of argument is to be addressed to the Court , so the jury can not hear , as you both know perfectly well . See if you ca n't ask your question in some other way , Mr. Field . " " Yes , your Honor . " The lawyers returned to their tables and Roger resumed his crossexamination . " Now , Mr. Edgerly , do n't you remember Mr. Hart talking to you about the quality of your lobsters on the Monday after July Fourth ? " " Yes , I guess I do , now you speak of it . " " Will you tell the jury , as nearly as you can remember , what your conversation was ? " " Well , I called him on the phone at the Lobster House  --  that is , I called their number and asked for him , see , and he comes on and I say , ' Is that you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I say , ' Irv , this is Stan , and Irv , your account is getting too big . You 've got to realize I have my own pay roll to meet and I 'm not running a bank down here , ' I says . ' You ca n't expect me to keep sending you lobsters , Irv , ' I says  --  " " What did he say ? " broke in Roger , hastily . " Well , that was when he said the lobsters were n't so good  --  after I jumped on him to pay me for them . " " And he did send you a payment the next day , did n't he ? " " Yes , he did  --  hut not all he owed me . " " And he did say some of the lobsters were dead , did n't he ? " " Yes . " " Did he say how many , or how many pounds ? " " No , he did n't . Ile just said some of them , like I told you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead  --  that was just a stall . Them lobsters was okay  --  crawling around like nobody 's business . " The judge leaned forward . " We 'll suspend here . " Everyone stood . The sheriff intoned , the judge vanished , the jury dispersed . Roger gave a deep sigh of relief and , gathering up his papers , began stuffing them into his brief case . When he looked up , he saw Fleeney standing beside him . " See here ! Are you really going on tomorrow ? Why do n't you let me have a judgment ? If you 've got a defense , I wish you 'd tell me what it is . " " I 've told you already , " Roger replied doggedly . " Edgerly and Hart agreed that last payment should settle the account , because the lobsters were n't satisfactory . " " Okay , okay . See you in the morning . " 107Roger watched his opponent out of sight with a mounting sensation of triumph . He was far too excited to feel fatigue and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being hungry . Though all the cards had been stacked against him , his first desperate efforts at trying a case had not ended disastrously ; even David Salomont , even Roscoe Cutter himself could not have stalled more successfully than he had . His nervousness , his lack of self-confidence , his sense of inferiority were all gone . Never again would he feel intimidated by a nondescript jury ; never again would some small-town lawyer be able to browbeat him . He had proved that he could hold his own against any and all of them . Of course , he must still find Hart ; but first he would take time out to get to a telephone and tell Emily . . . . Tell Emily ? Tell her what ? If he had suddenly been kicked in the stomach by a mule , the sense of shock would hardly have been greater . He could tell her about the jury trial , of course . But he would also have to tell her that he was delayed in Salem , for how much longer he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening which was to make up for their own disastrous dinner . . . . He located a pay telephone in the basement , secured some nickels from a bored clerk , and called his house . The answer was so immediate as to suggest that Emily was already awaiting a call from him . He swallowed hard . " Hello , darling . I 'm calling to say that I 'm in Salem on a jury trial . " " At last ! That 's what you 've been hoping and hoping for , is n't it ? " " Yes . And things have gone pretty well , so far  --  a lot better than I expected . I 'm feeling awfully good about that . The hitch is , I do n't know just when I can get home . " " You do n't mean you 're afraid you ca n't get here in time for dinner ? Why , Salem is only  --  " " I know . And of course I could easily , if I could start for Boston right now . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even met him yet and I do n't know where to find him . " " Roger , it 's terribly important that you should n't do anything to offend Uncle Homer . " " I realize that . But this case is still more important . The job has to come first . You know that , do n't you , dear ? " There was no immediate answer . " Do n't you ? " he persisted . " Yes , I suppose so , but  --  " " Listen , Emily , every minute we spend talking is going to make me that much later . You know I 'll get there if I possibly can . Wish me luck . Good-by . " He hung up , looked in the telephone book for Hart 's number and dialed again . There was no answer and , after a moment or two , his nickel was returned . His feeling of triumph was gone now . Suddenly he knew that he was inexpressibly empty and tired , that he wanted food and drink androbrest . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither he nor any member of his family was at home , and the Lobster House seemed the only other probable place where the elusive client might be found . This being the case , the next step was to take a taxi and get to Beverly as rapidly as possible . Roger discovered , however , that taxis did not cruise hopefully through the streets of Salem after dark in search of stray fares , and eventually he walked all the way back to the station before finding one . The drive to Beverly also consumed far more time than he had anticipated and , when he reached the Lobster House , he was informed that Mr. Hart , though expected , seldom came in before six . Of course the gentleman could wait if he wanted to . He was welcome to a seat in the restaurant whether he ordered dinner or not . But Mr. Hart kept his private office locked . . . . Roger hesitated . With a good meal inside him , he probably would feel better . On the other hand , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elude him . He decided in favor of a dingy passageway outside the private office , where he reviewed the file in the feeble light that came from a solitary bulb . He had read it through several times when the outer door to the passageway opened , and a heavy man , wearing baggy trousers and a tight-fitting coat , came lumbering in Roger 's direction . He was in need of both a shave and a haircut , but he would not have been bad looking if his expression had been less ill-humored . He glanced at his visitor in a surly way and without speaking . Roger stepped forward . " Mr. Hart ? I 'm Roger Field . I 've been trying that lobster case in Salem . " " Who ? Oh , that one . Well , what about it ? " " We were reached this afternoon and you were n't there . I had to stall  --  drag out my cross-examination to kill time  --  till you could get to court . Did n't you hear from our office ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct answer . Then , as if struck by a sudden thought , he added , " You do n't mean you expect me to go to Salem tomorrow ? " " Why , yes , Mr. Hart . This is your case . I 'm trying to win it for you and you 're my only witness . " I ; ' or the first time , Hart smiled . " Shucks , boy ! You 're okay , but I ca n't spare the time . Lots coming up tomorrow . I 'm about through for today , though . Here , come on into my office . Sit down . Have a cigar . Have a drink . " He unlocked the door and stepped inside , switching on the light to disclose a cluttered , roll-top desk , a swivel chair , and a couch covered with a dingy " throw " which had once been gaudy . Roger followed him , but declined the invitation to be seated . " I 'm sorry , sir , but I 'm in rather a hurry . My wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you will just be kind enough to glance over this testimony with me  --  " ioqWhile Roger was speaking , Hart had leaned forward to push a button and he now interrupted his caller by giving an abrupt order for Scotch and soda to a waiter who appeared in the doorway . Then , tilting his chair back , he smiled more and more expansively . " Do n't worry about your dinner , boy . Never any harm being a little late to shindigs women are mixed up in . Lord knows such things last long enough anyhow . And look , there do n't have to be any testimony . I 've hocked my house , and the bank 's letting me have cash enough to hand those dopes half what I owe them . What 's more , business is holding up so good this fall , I 'll be getting my creditors off my neck by June . Then next summer , I 'll really be making dough . I 'll just call Stan up and get him to drop the whole thing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the ready money . " " But Mr. Hart , I think with the case pending , this sort of thing ought to go through Mr. Fleeney , especially with the trial actually going on . " " Maybe , maybe . Was Edgerly there ? " " Why , yes , of course . He was on the stand most of the afternoon  --  after we were reached , that is . " The waiter reappeared , bearing the Scotch and soda . As he poured out whisky with a lavish hand , Mr. Hart good-naturedly admonished his caller . " Loosen up , boy . I wangled a roll out of the Third National this afternoonand you 've been showing up that fourfiusher , Edgerly . We can both do with a little of this stuff . Here 's mud in your eye ! " Tardily seating himself on the dingy couch , Roger accepted the profferedglass and slowly drank a little from it . Then he set it down on the floor beside him . It was unbelievable to him that his client , his very first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial salvationhad been entrusted to him , Roger Field , when both were endangered , and who had now been at least temporarily rescued , should be shrugging aside everything that seemed of such vital importance . Yet that was what Hart seemed to be doing . He said they did n't need to look over the testimony . He said he was ready to " drop the whole thing . " Roger tried again to make himself clear . " Mr. Hart , " he said earnestly , " I want to be sure you understand exactly what I did do in court . I had an entirely new idea . I got your answer amended to say that your last payment was in accord and satisfaction , so that it would settle the whole thing . It looked to me , from our file , as if that was what you intended , after they shipped you so many bad lobsters . If you could come and testify to that , we might be able to beat them . " With a reproachful look , Mr. Hart poured more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was already empty . " That 's nice of you , boy , and do n't think I ca n't appreciate all you 're trying to do . But I do n't like trials and I do n't want to get up on the stand and give some smart-aleck lawyer , like Fleeney , the chance to make amonkey out of me . You get hold of him right now , on the phone , and tell him he can have half his claim in cash , if that 's your idea . It is n't a bad one either . If you clean this thing up tonight , then you and your little woman can go ahead and have all the fun you want , and I can forget about the whole damn business . " Reluctantly , Roger fumbled through the directory and , reaching for the telephone on his client 's desk , called Mr. Fleeney 's house . A childish voice answered . " Is Mr. Fleeney there ? " asked Roger . " Who ? " said the child . " Mr. Fleeney , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the mouthpiece . " Some little girl , I guess , " he explained to his client . " Ask her if her daddy 's home , " suggested Mr. Hart , sighing audibly at Roger 's inexperience . " Is your daddy home ? " " No ? " " Is her mom home , " prompted Mr. Hart . " Is your mom home ? " repeated Roger . " Yes . " " I want to talk to your mom , " begged Roger , inwardly writhing , but forcing himself to speak patiently . There was a long interval of silence . Then he heard the closing of a door , approaching footsteps and finally , a woman 's voice . " This is Roger Field , Mrs. Fleeney , " he explained . " I 've been trying a case against your husband in Salem and he wanted to discuss settlement with me this afternoon . I could n't do so then , but I can now . Have you any idea when he 'll be home ? " " Might be almost any minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your house , if I may , and wait for him . " " That 's the way to talk , " Mr. Hart said approvingly . He opened the top drawer of the desk , took out a checkbook and , breathing hard , began to write . Then , as he ripped out a check and handed it to Roger , who was already standing , hat in hand , he added , " You just dangle this in front of Fleeney 's nose and I bet he wo n't be able to resist it . But understand , he 's got to take it or leave it , just as it 's written . So long ! " Once in a taxi again , Roger fought against the temptation of going straight to the railroad station . To be sure , the end of the whole wretched business seemed at last to be in sight . But nervousness overwhelmed him again ; fatigue and depression engulfed him . He doubted whether he had the stamina to cope with a shrewd , hard-boiled customer like Fleeney when in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasedwhen he found that Fleeney was still absent from home . Mrs. Fleeney , a somewhat slatternly and vaguely unpleasant woman , received him rather suspiciously , but ushered him into a room furnished with arrrrroparlor suite , upholstered in green brocatelle , and told him to wait . Then she disappeared , saying she must put her little girl to bed , and Roger sat interminably on the stiff sofa trying , without much success , to focus his attention on the tinted enlargements of family photographs which hung on the walls . At last a key turned in the lock and the front door opened . " Hi , Molly ! Any supper left ? " The voice was unquestionably Mr. Fleeney 's . Footsteps above hurried toward the stairway . " Sure I have supper for you , warm on the kitchen stove , " Mrs. Fleeney called down . " But there 's a Mr. Field in the parlor , waiting to see you . " A short silence , plainly indicative of displeasure , followed this announcement . Then Mr. Fleeney strode into the parlor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired abruptly . " I 'm sorry to bother you at home , Mr. Fleeney , " Roger began apologetically , " but I thought you seemed interested in a settlement . So I talked to my client to see if we could avoid going forward tomorrow morning . I 'm pleased to report that I have a check right here for half Mr. Edgerly 's claim . " " On account ? " Fleeney inquired grimly . " Why , no . In full settlement . " As he spoke , Roger held out the check . Fleeney shook his head . " You ca n't get rid of me so easy , " he said . " If you want to hand me that now and get me notes that will come due in the early summer for the rest , I 'm willing to ask Edgerly to take a chance on them . Otherwise , I want a judgment , as I told you this afternoon . As a matter of fact , come to think of it , I 'm scared of notes from Hart , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll give him until after July Fourth to pay the other half . " " I 'm sorry , Mr. Fleeney . This check is all I can offer you . I hope very much you 'll accept it . But Mr. Hart said you could take it or leave it . " " Oh , he did , did he ? Well , you can tell him I leave it . I 'll get my judgment and put his joint into receivership . " " Mr. Fleeney  --  " " Look here , you 're wasting your time and mine . You 'd better get on back to Boston . " There was no mistaking the finality of his words . Roger put the check slowly back into his pocket . " May I use your telephone ? " he asked tonelessly . The dull , depressing feeling that he seemed destined to spend endlessperiods in telephone conversations which , after all , served no useful purpose , rendered the request doubly difficult . But he knew he could not start back to Boston without making an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There it is on the hall table . But , if you do n't mind , I 'm going in to supper . Good night . " " Good night . " 112Roger gave the number of the Lobster House and listened to the repeatedringing of the telephone . Finally , a gruff male voice answered . " May I speak to Mr. Hart please ? " " He 's gone . " " Gone ! Where can I reach him ? " " I du n no . " " Listen , my name is Field , Roger Field . I 'm Mr. Hart 's attorney and it 's important to Mr. Hart that I should get in touch with him tonight . Ca n't you find out where he is ? " " Look , Mr. Field , I 'm just the cashier . I 'd like to help you , but all I can tell you is Mr. Hart left and I 'm sure he 's not coming back tonight . " " Well , would you write down a message and leave it on Mr. Hart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mr. Field called . Be in court at ten . ' " " I got it . " " Thanks . Good night . " He hung up the receiver and sat still for a moment . Savory odors drifted into the chilly hallway from the kitchen beyond and he wondered , vaguely , what sort of people would permit a cold and tired caller to leave their house , while they sat in a warm room , enjoying appetizing food , without asking whether he would care to join them . But he did not dwell on the thought after he had pulled himself together and gone out into the street . A drizzly rain was falling and again there was no taxi in sight . Turning up the collar of his coat and buttoning this more closely around him , he walked to the station , where he found that a train had just left ; so he paced up and down the platform until another came along , nearly an hour later . Then he climbed aboard and sagged into a seat , utterly discouraged . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , but not to antagonize both his opponent and his client . Mr. Fleeney was ready to try the case to the end and seek a receivership ; Mr. Hart would be angry at his failure to persuade Fleeney to settle . And , as for Emily , whom he had not even tried to reach again , knowing she would have long since left the house .... He became aware that the local , which had been lurching toward Boston , was slowing down . Then it stopped altogether . He rubbed the windownear him with his hand , but could see no lights outside , except at a distance . Whistles blew , first from the engine of his train and then from another , farther away . A brakeman , carrying a lantern , hurried through the car , ignoring the efforts made by Roger and the other scattered passengersto question him . Roger sat a few minutes , his concern growing , and finally went out on the platform . At the foot of the steps stood the brakeman . " Better stay up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get off ? " begged Roger. 113 " Not unless you want to get wet . " " I do n't mind getting a little wet , if I can just get home . " " Yeah , but you would n't get home , and your widow might be sorry . " " Why , what 's the trouble ? " " Drawbridge stuck open . We 're on a trestle . Better go back in and keep your shirt on , mister . " The lights grew dim , the car turned cold , then the steam came banging back on ; but the little train stood still over the tidal inlet whose traffic had indirectly balked the railroad . Roger heard occasional shouts and saw an occasional lantern . At last the ancient locomotive sighed , struggled , and started across the draw , which somehow had been wheedled back into place . A few minutes later , iL.lxrstled into Boston . Roger stumbled down the steps , hurried through the station concourse and climbed into a taxi , which wove its way through the maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door . He let himself in quietly , kicked off his rubbers in the vestibule and flung down his hat and coat on the nearest chair . It was Emily 's custom to leave a room pleasantly lighted , even when they went out ; therefore , it came as no surprise to him to see that the library was not in darkness . But he was puzzled by the murmur of voices . He pushed back the portieres and walked in . David and Emily were seated close to the fire , so absorbed in what they were saying to each other that neither was instantly aware of his entrance . Chapter 11FOR A MOMENT , Roger had the strange feeling that he was the interloper , that it was David who really belonged there in the library , beside the fire with Emily . He tried unsuccessfully to suppress it as both preposterous and morbid , and went forward , making an effort to speak cordially and naturally ; but the sickening sense of intrusion became stronger and stronger . Emily had not come quickly into the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way she had always done before ; instead she sat very still , her white dress dazzling against the crimson of her chair , her lovely face almost expressionless . David , on the contrary , leaped up , holdingout his hand and exclaiming , " Hello there ! You have had a day of it ! " before Roger himself could think of anything to say . Yes , it was as if David were the host , as if he were the outsider and as if Emily did not belong wholly to him any more . " You 're right . I have had a day of it , " he answered wearily . Even his voice did not sound like his own , just as this room did not seem like his own and Emily did not seem like his own . He turned away from David and looked at her , hoping for help , and she did not give it to him . He knew this must be because she could not , for some reason that he did not understand , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better if he asked her to tell him what she had done , rather than to go on trying to tell her what he had done . Perhaps he should ask her how she happened to be sitting in their house on Joy Street , his and hers , alone with David Salomont , instead of being at the Copley Plaza with a group of their old friends . After she had told him that , everything would be all right . It was because she sat so still , because she did not smile or speak that everything seemed so strange and sickening . Well , he would ask her . But David spoke again before he could frame his question . " Your loss was certainly my gain , " David said , still with great good cheer . " Emily was kind enough to call me up and ask me to fill in at Mr. Lathrop 's dinner . Naturally , I was delighted to do so . Then , after dinner she decided she 'd like to come back here and wait for you , instead of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss you when you did get114 115home . So we 've been sitting her beside the fire talking  --  why , for almost a couple of hours now ! I do n't know when I 've enjoyed myself so much . I 'll run along now though . By the way , how 'd you make out in Salem ? " " Well , that 's a long story  --  " " Then it 'll keep till morning . " " I have to go back to Salem in the morning . The case is n't closed yet . " That was n't the thing to say . He ought to have thanked David for filling in , he ought to have said he was glad his friend could keep his wife companythrough a long and disappointing evening . But he did n't feel grateful to David , he was n't glad to find him with Emily in the library . He hated him . And that was puesila artd senseless . David had done the right thing at the right time , just as he always did . The right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . " Good night . Emily . Thanks again for everything . " " Good night , David . Thank you for everything . " Well , she had spoken at last , she had smiled at last . Now everything would be better . But everything was not better . David had gone over to the chair where Emily was sitting and put his arm around the back of it . He did not touch her and yet , as he bent over her , the effect was that of a caress offered and accepted . He stayed there for a moment looking down at her , not saying anything more , not needing to . Then he straightened up and shook hands with Roger , still speaking cheerily , and afterward he was gone . The front door closed behind him with a bang . Emily rose and came over to Roger , putting her lovely arms around his neck . " Darling , " she said gently . " Darling , I 'm so sorry you 've had such an awful day . I could n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , we can have a good talk . First though , you 've got to have a drink and something to eat . Ellie 's left everything ready , in the pantry . Please sit down and rest , while I get it for you . " He was too tired to protest , too tired to say she must not wait on him , or that he was n't hungry , or that all right , he would get the whisky and sandwiches himself . Emily brought them in , quietly and expertly , and set them down on the table before him . She filled two tall glasses with ice from a thermos bucket and poured out two drinks , a stiff one for Roger and a light one for herself . Then she uncovered the sandwiches , folding back the damp napkin to disclose a tempting array topped with crisp sprigs of parsley . Roger drank slowly , and as the warmth of the whisky filtered through his veins , he began to take slow bites from a sandwich . But all the time he kept thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child who needed her care , not as if I were a man who could take care of her . If we had a son , this is the way she would act toward him . She would n't act this way toward David , if he were her husband . She would n't need to . He116would n't come home , half dead , hours later than she expected him . He 'd manage to be around whenever she wanted him , he 'd always be a credit to her . . . . " After you telephoned , I called up Uncle Homer and told him I was afraid you could n't make the dinner , that perhaps he 'd better ask one of his old friends to fill in , " Emily was saying soothingly . " But he would n't . He said of course you 'd make it . " ( There it was again . Homer Lathrop had said of course he 'd make it . Men Iike Homer Lathrop and men like David Salomont did n't give out half an hour before a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven , just to assure himself you 'd got home . When I told him you had n't and that I had no idea how to reach you , he said in that case , I 'd have to find , someone to fill in  --  he could n't . " ( Yes , and I know just the way he said it : . You 're trying to spare me as much as you can , Emily , you 're trying to make this easy for me , but I know . I know Homer Lathrop told you again just what he thought of me , he intimated you 'd made your own bed , in spite of all he could do to preventyou and now you 'd have to lie in it . He would n't help you out . Could n't ? Of course he could have ! He could have asked any one of a dozen old fogies , snoozing around in big leather armchairs , right at his elbow in the Somerset Club , but he would n't . He dared you to find someone in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seven-thirty dinner , the night of a Waltz Evening . He never thought you 'd ask a Jew to the Somerset Club . ) " Well , I tried to think and think fast . I thought first of Pell . But I remembered you said he did n't own dress clothes , that he hired them when he needed them . Besides , there 's no telephone listed in his name . " " Oh  --  so you did try to call him after all ? " " No . I  --  I knew that already . You see , after you told me about the way he 'd lived , the way he got his start , all that , I was terribly interested . Do n't you remember , you asked me if I 'd ever walked all the way down Joy Street , on the other side of the Hill , and I told you I had n't ? But I did , the next day . And before I started out , I tried to find Pell 's name in the telephone book , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sort of a place he lived in . And he was n't listed . " " I see . " Vaguely and illogically , Roger felt relieved to learn that Pell and not David had been Emily 's first choice in her dilemma . He took another drink , and though his glass was nowhere nearly empty , Emily poured a little more whisky and put another lump of ice in it . " You did n't think of Brian , I suppose , " he asked , biting into his sandwich again . " Brian ! That uncouth , clowning Mick ! I certainly did n't . " " Do n't talk like Homer Lathrop , Emily . " " I 'm sorry , darling . I did n't mean to . But you have n't forgotten , haveyou ? That ham actor entrance , that awful red tie , those terrible stories --  " " No  --  no . Of course you could n't risk having anything like that happena second time . I 'm afraid we 're not going to make much headway with117the plan we had  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good feeling , a place where better understanding could be promoted . " " Well , we will yet . You 'll see . It 's just because you " re so tired , Roger , that you think we ca n't  --  eventually . But , in the meantime  --  " " In the meantime you could n't ask Pell to fill in because he does n't own dress clothes and you would n't ask Brian because he would n't bother to wear them unless he felt like it . And you faced a major crisis because your trustee was short one man for a dinner party on account of your husband'sunavoidable absence . " For the first time since their marriage , he was speaking to her sarcasticallyand bitterly , as he had on the evening when they became engaged . But if his tone surprised or.ht* ; her , she gave no indication of it . Instead , she went on speaking in the same soothing way as before . " In the meantime I thought perhaps David was my best bet . I had no idea where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of course he is in the telephone book . And he got here in no time at all . I do n't see how he managed , dressing and everything . He lives on Aspinwall Avenue , way out by Coolidge Corner . But he said he was used to doing things on the double . " " There 's no doubt about that . " Again he spoke sarcastically and again she disregarded his sarcasm . " You should have seen Uncle Homer 's face when I walked into the club with David , " she said , almost gleefully . " I had n't called him back myself  --  Ellie did that for me  --  and he understood her to say I was bringing a Mr. Sulloway . Of course he thought it was one of the New Hampshire Sulloways and he was terribly pleased  --  it seems there was a Sulloway in his class who was , quite outstanding and he leaped to the conclusion that this was a son or a nephew of that one , who happened to be in town and whom I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took me aside as soon as he could and asked me if I 'd gone crazy . He said , You ca n't take that fellow with you to the Waltz Evening , Emily . You 'd never be asked again if you did . ' " " I hope you told him , in that case , your own social position must be pretty shaky . " " No-o-o . I did n't think it was the best time and place to start an argument . I 'm planning to have that later . I told him I would n't dream of going to the Waltz Evening without you , that I was coming back here to wait for you , as soon as the dinner was over , but that I 'd taken him up on his dare . " " So you knew it was a dare , when he told you to find an extra man ? " " Of course . And did I turn the tables on him ? David was the great success of the evening . He dominated the dinner . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation or being aggressive or anything like that . But he was so entertaining that everyone wanted to listen to him and so attractive that no one could help looking at him . Before werr8came away , several people had asked him to drop in for cocktails and the Amorys had invited him to Sunday dinner . I could see that Uncle Homer was fairly foaming at the mouth with rage . " " Well , evidently we can drop our philanthropic plans as far as David 's concerned . He 'll be pretty well launched after tonight . " " Why , I had n't thought of it that way ! But I guess he will be . " " You can be damn sure David 's thought of it that way . I only hope he 's properly grateful to you . " Roger set down his glass and laid his half-eaten sandwich beside it . " I seem to be pretty well bushed , " he said . " Let 's get upstairs , shall we ? No do n't bother with the tray . I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Joy Street house permitted the use of a hall bedroom as a dressing room for Roger , and this dressing room included in its equipment an Empire day bed . It was Caroline 's belief  --  or at least her hope  --  that Roger slept there , and not in the enormous sleigh bed , which was the main feature of the large , luxurious chamber that adjoined the dressing room . As a matter of fact , he had never done so , even when he was ill , and he and Emily had often joked about the alleged advantages of separate apartments for married couples , while lying cozily side by side . Now , for some reason that he could not define , Roger felt that he wanted to be alone , that solitude would mean even more to him , in his exhausted state , than the nearness of his beloved . He undressed slowly , wondering just how he could tell Emily this without hurting her feelings , wishing that it were possible simply to close the door between the two rooms and lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burying his head on the soft pillows without a word of explanation or excuse . But he felt sure this would wound Emily deeply and that was the last thing on earth he wanted to do , especially when she had been so understanding and so kind , first in the face of his inadequacy and then in the face of his ungraciousness . He went to the threshold and paused there , hoping that the right words would come . Emily was already in bed , but she had not turned on her side , with one arm under head , as she generally did when she was beginning to grow drowsy . If she had been , he might have gone back into the dressing room and stayed there a few minutes longer , puttering around among his possessions , until she was still sleepier or actually asleep . Then there would have been little or no need for explanations ; she would not even have missed him until later . But she was sitting up , with two pillows behind her , her soft hair hanging in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nightgown , her skin was luminous . He had never seen her when she looked more lovely ; yet at the moment he did not desire her . He wanted only to say good night and leave her . But when she saw him , she smiled ; and her smile , like her eyes , was welcoming . She held out her arms.
