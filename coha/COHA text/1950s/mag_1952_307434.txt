It promised to be the fattest annual exhibition the Southern Vermont Artists , Inc. had ever had . <P> Bargain hunters found plenty to choose from . Artists ranged from such established figures as Ogden Pleissner , Dean Fausett and Luigi Luciono to Housepainter Patsy Santo , local farmers , housewives and schoolchildren . Prices began at $15 and ran up to $3,500 . Many buyers were year-round citizens . There were also some big-name summer people who showed up with their checkbooks ready , among them Merck &; Co.
