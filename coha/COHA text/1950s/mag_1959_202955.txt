MUSCLE BEACH ( 236 pp. ) - Ira Wallach-Little , Brown ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> A boggle is , among other things , the gurgle made by quicksand as it closes over its victim . Such febrile considerations flash through the boggled minds of readers as they sink out of sight in Author Wallach 's pun-swampy prose . The man is popping with word-foolery . He interrupts his narrative-and a more interruptible narrative would be hard to find-to inform the reader that a tirade is " a sneak attack on a haberdashery , " and a syndrome is " a large amphitheater where the ancient Romans used to sin . " He dreams moodily of going to Canada and establishing a police force equal in every respect to the Mounties . " I would call them the Royal Canadian Tanta-mounties , " writes Wallach , adding with crocodile contrition : " Thoughts like this are basically sterile . " <P> They are , and it is just as well , If the little monsters were to breed , perhaps with the four-headed puns of Peter ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might never be the same . Still , considering the general run of summer fiction , Wallach 's fable is funny enough . He tells of a soulful young swimming-pool salesman who leaves Manhattan because " inside stuffy little apartments a million parakeets mess up their cages and refuse to say an intelligent word " -a conception subtle with the flavor of Zen-Zen , the West Coast 's cultural mouthwash . In California , the hero sells pools frantically , working toward that aqueous millennium when " canoe trips from San Francisco to Tia Juana would be feasible , all by swimming pool and with no portage more than thirty yards . " <P> The pool peddler is happy until he chances upon Muscle Beach , a Pacific sand pile on which barbell brontosauri lovingly cultivate their abs ( abdominal beef ) , glutes ( backsides ) and pects ( chest muscles ) . There he spies the girl of his dreams-but alas , she loves a weight lifter . Can the underpected salesman sunder this pair ? Sure he can , if he will only assert his baritoned intelligence against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is-in the definition of Poet-Punster Mark Van Doren-a guy with a false set o ' values .
