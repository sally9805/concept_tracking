Maggie ( book by Hugh Thomas ; music &; lyrics by William Roy ) , trying to halve its cake and eat it too , attempted to reduce What Every Woman Knows to a libretto with musicomedy icing . But though it took pains to preserve the Barrie spirit . Maggie lacked the right winsome plainness and eventually turned downright dull . <P> English Actress Betty Paul caught Maggie to perfection , while Keith Andres ' John Shand was authentically yet attractively dour . But the two of them were sadly outnumbered by flat tunes , insipid ballets and country-cousin stabs at sophistication . Maggie , which closed at week 's end , seemed less a revamping of a favorite play than a revival of a long-buried musical .
