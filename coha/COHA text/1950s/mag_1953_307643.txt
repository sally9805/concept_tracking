On Capitol Hill one morning last week , members of the Senate Armed Services Committee sat sedately along one side of a big conference table , ready to pass judgment on the men whom Dwight Eisenhower had nominated to replace the present Joint Chiefs of Staff . Across the table , nervously awaiting their ordeal by interrogation , sat the four beribboned nominees ( see cut ) - prospective Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Arthur Radford , the Navy 's schoolmasterish-looking Admiral Robert Carney , the Air Force 's handsome , white-maned General Nathan Twining and the Army 's General Matthew Ridgway , stiffly erect in paratroop boots . <P> Spectators and newsmen were counting on fireworks . As the hard-hitting leader of the 1949 " revolt of the admirals , " Arthur Radford had opposed the building of the B-36 ( as " a billion-dollar blunder " ) and had questioned the morality and military wisdom of " the atomic blitz . " Now , across the table from him sat some of the Senate 's strongest air-power advocates , among them Democrat Stuart Symington of Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Air Force . <P> Pointed Question . From the start , Radford made it clear that he had changed his mind about a lot of things since 1949 . New Hampshire 's Senator Styles Bridges wanted to know whether Radford now considered the atom-bomb-carrying Strategic Air Command " a primary safeguard to the U.S. " <P> Radford : I think it is most important . <P> Bridges : Do you believe in development of the hydrogen bomb ? <P> Radford : Yes , sir . <P> Bridges : Do you believe the decision to go forward with the B-52 bomber was a correct one ? <P> Radford : Yes , sir . <P> Finally , Stuart Symington braced Navy Spokesman Radford with a single pointed question . As chairman of the Joint Chiefs , would he work as hard for the Army and Air Force as for the Navy ? Answered Radford : " I will work primarily for the U.S. , and I will do my best not to favor any particular service . " <P> " Mr. Chairman , " said Symington , " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qualified Answers . From the scars left by the revolt of the admirals , the committee turned to the open wounds left by Defense Secretary Wilson 's proposed cuts in Air Force appropriations. * Disturbed by outgoing Air Force Chief Hoyt Vandenberg 's statement that he had not protested the cuts before the National Security Council , Maine 's Margaret Chase Smith asked each of the four nominees whether he would " speak up " if he thought that the defense budget had been cut so much as to endanger the U.S. security . With varying degrees of qualification , each said he would . <P> Democrat Symington sailed in to defend Vandenberg , the man who was n't there . By indirection , Symington accused Charlie Wilson of failure to consult Vandenberg , the Air Force chief of staff , on the Air Force budget cuts . It was his understanding , said Symington , that at the time of the crucial NSC meeting , General Vandenberg had not yet been told that the planned slash in the defense budget would come almost entirely out of Air Force funds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to fulfill his promise to speak up . <P> Symington : Did Secretary Wilson ever discuss the cuts in the Air Force with you ? <P> Twining : No , sir ...
