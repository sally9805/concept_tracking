Two months before he died of Hodgkin 's disease , at 33 , Rumanian-born Pianist Dinu Lipatti played for the last time in public , at the 1950 International Festival in Besangon , France . To keep the date , he overrode his doctor 's and his wife 's pleas not to play , was fortified with drugs . Close to fainting at the keyboard , he had to omit the last brief selection on the program , Chopin 's Waltz No. 2 in A Flat .

Only an occasional slurred passage in the Chopin waltzes hints at the ordeal at the keyboard .
