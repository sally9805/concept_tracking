Northern Democrats called Dwight Eisenhower a doddering old conservative when , during the 1958 campaign , he declared that liberal Democrats were headlong " spenders . " But last week , with the election and Democratic victory well in the bag , Washington was doing a double take at a liberal spending program that proved that Ike had been guilty of understatement . <P> Under examination was a manifesto issued by the liberal-dominated Democratic National Advisory Council ( among the members : Adlai Stevenson , Harry Truman , New York 's Governor Averell Harriman and ex-Senator Herbert Lehman ) . The council urged greatly expanded federal programs in social security , health , education , agriculture , public works and welfare , area redevelopment and urban renewal , did not attempt to put a price tag on the proposals . Virginia 's economy-minded Senator Harry Flood Byrd-no member of the council-did . His estimate : $5 billion or $6 billion a year . <P> The Democratic Advisory Council could not have cared less , because it was operating on a theory-one often espoused by the British Labor Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Truman 's Council of Economic Advisers . Criticizing Republicans for allowing " persistent inflation , " the Democratic Advisory Council manifesto said : <P> " The main key to effective inflation control is sustained full employment and full production , combined with truly competitive pricing . " How should full employment and production be achieved ? " Government expenditures , keyed to our vital needs and resource capabilities , are in themselves a key factor in maximum economic growth . . . It is elementary that a growing nation needs larger public as well as larger private expenditures , just as it costs more to support a family of five than it does a family of three . " <P> In plainer language , the council 's cure for inflation is to create more inflation-through Government spending .
