OIL &; GAS <P> Near Joliet , Ill. one afternoon last week , a group of oilmen and Chicago city officials assembled around a 30-in. pipe . While the state flags of Texas and Illinois fluttered in the breeze , the wheel of a big control valve was turned . There was a rearing whoosh , and gas from Texas began to flow to Chicago through a new 1,417-mile pipeline . <P> The pipeline , which cost a thumping $135 million , was laid by a subsidiary of Peoples Gas Light and Coke Co. , Chicago 's only gas supplier and one of the biggest in the U.S. It marked the latest step in a huge expansion program , which in four years has added 70,000 new customers for Peoples , boosted its sales by 49% to $66.6 million last year . Chairman James F. Gates , 52 , the man responsible for this growth , hopes that the new pipeline will ease Chicago 's gas shortage , but he is n't sure it will . There are still 100,000 gas-less Chicagoans . <P> In the Beginning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago ( pop . 80,000 ) was small . As the city mushroomed and other companies came in , Peoples won a series of rate wars , absorbed twelve competitors , and by 1907 had the market to itself . As demand spared still higher , it bought into a pipeline company with gas reserves in Texas , helped build the first long-distance pipeline , began selling gas to heat homes . <P> By the end of World War II , the company 's biggest problem was a lack of supply . To help solve it , Peoples brought in Illinois-born Jim Dates , a Northwestern-trained lawyer who had bossed purchasing policy for the Ordnance Department for two years during the war , previously made a name as an expert in utility law . <P> Under the Dome . Peoples was part owner of a pipeline from Texas . Oates 's first move was to acquire it outright for more than $42 million , thus got control of a second pipeline under construction . Gates then formed another pipeline subsidiary with $120 million capital , and last year started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast . <P> Jim Oates 's newest pipeline will boost the Chicago area 's natural-gas supply by 374 million cubic feet daily , an increase of 73% . Gates is working on still another method of satisfying his customers . His company has leased 12,000 acres of land outside Joliet , under which is a domelike geological formation . In the next few years , Gates plans to start pumping surplus gas into the ground there each summer , store it for use in the peak winter season . Developing this vast storage space ( 90 billion cubic feet ) will cost $50 million , but spending that kind of money has never yet fazed Jim Gates .
