not everything he said was automatically popular , he was proud of the name Fighting Bob Hooker , and he lived in yearly expectation of favorable comparison with William Allen White and Ed Howe . Actually he had been so compared , but only locally , at luncheons , and he was waiting for similar word from New York . An article he sold to The Saturday Evening Post was a constant reminder to Gibbsville citizens that their man of letters was good enough for national publication ; the inference , which was drawn and encouraged , being that Bob could do it any time he wanted to , but that the Gibbsville Standardand Gibbsville had first call on his talents . A later article , intended for the Post 's Cities of America series , was returned to Bob with such reluctance that readers of the letter could not understand how the Post editors could bear to part with the article . It was not , however , wasted effort . The article was printed up as a leaflet for the Chamber of Commerce , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bob 's professional effort was wasted . His newspaper enjoyed quiet subsidies from the Coal &; Iron Company and the Republican party war chest , which seldom differed on policy , and when they did differ , the differences were not irreconcilable . A citizen who wondered what kind of cars Bob owned would not have had to peer in his garage ; he could make his deduction from the advertisingin the Standard . Bob Hooker had learned his profession in the days when newspapermen were given passes on railroads . As editor and publisher he felt entitled to appropriate courtesies from hotels , steamship lines and any other enterprises that valued the good will of the press . If he wanted to obtain tickets for a heavyweight prize fight in a distant city , he ' sent his request through the United Press or the newspaper feature . syndicates . He rarely sought these favors for his personal use , but a couple of seats for a World Series game went a long way with the right people . He and his wife signed all chits at the John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country Club , which had no free list . But even'at the club Bob Hooker had a minor arrangement with the golf professional , who got his name mentioned in all golf activities as a courtesy in exchange for free balls , tees , club-cleaning and all such goods and services . Nor did he forget that his wife was entitled to consideration by the merchants . He knew something about mark-ups , and when his wife bought a dress or a snit or a furry item , she paid approximately the cost price , not the wholesale price . The small loss to the merchant in the difference betweencost and wholesale was also the difference between favorable mention in the Standard 's society column and no mention at all . Butp101all such courtesy arrangements took place between the publisher and the principal . Any reporter who was caught " on the take " was fired without warning . A bottle of whiskey or a box of candy at Christmas was permissible ; but greater courtesies were restricted to the top level . " I want no grafters , " Bob Hooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In another day Bob Hooker 's office had been as full of photographs and souvenirs as the Mayor 's office in City Hall . Not so in 1945 . On his return a few years earlier from a trip to Daytona Beach he found that in his absence his wife had done over the sanctum sanctorum , layingdown wall-to-wall carpet , installing bookshelves , and furnishing the room with a massive desk and leather club chairs . His old Remington Number 10 looked strangely out of place in the new elegance , but his wife was wise enough to know that the typewriter belonged in the room in the same way that a scale model of a Model T belonged in the office of Henry Ford , a tiny locomotive in the office of Samuel Vauclain , a speedboat in the headquarters of Gar Wood , a chest of machinist 's tools in the office of Walter P. Chrysler . A couple of millionof Bob Hooker 's own words had been tapped out on the Number 10 , the second typewriter he had ever owned and successor to his Smith Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the old office . Signed photographs of Herbert Hoover and Calvin Coolidge , Andrew Mellon and Mike Slattery , Joseph B. Chapin and George Horace Lorimer , E. T. Stotesbury and Gene Tunney and Mrs. Robert Hooker ( Kitty ) were framed in blue pinseal and placed at strategic points in the office , where they would catch the eye of the visitor . The other photographs of political and sporting figures , of Bob Hooker 's high school class and National Guard company , of coal breakers and high-tension towers and the starting of the Standard 's R. Hoe press , as well as caricatures and cartoons and letters from importantpeople  --  they were all removed from the office and stored in the Hookers ' town cellar for future hanging in his little den in the farmhouse down country . The knotty-pine paneling had been built into the den , but the framed souvenirs rested in the cellar . Bob Hooker , as literary man , permitted himself a few mild eccentricities . He was a pipe collector , for one . He shaved himself with a straight razor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried a hunting-case watch that wound with a key " for show , " and wore a time-piece on his wrist . There was nothing dangerously queer about him , but as a man of letters he knew he was not expected to be like everybody else . Another of his gentle aberrations was his insistence onp102an old-style desk instrument for telephoning . It was distinctive , and it cost him nothing . At its ring he picked up the receiver . ( At this hour of the day only important calls were put through to him . ) " It 's the Mayor , " said the switchboard girl . " Okay , " said Bob Hooker . " Hello , Mayor . " " Hello , Bob , " said Conrad Yates . " Bob , I been sitting here in my office thinking about Joe Chapin . " " Yes , yes , " said Hooker . " His memory will live with us a long , long time , Mayor . " ' That 's exactly what I wanted to speak to you . Exactly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . Joe 's memory . Did you ever know Joe Chapin kept me in Gibbsvillc ? " " Wiry , uh , did n't you tell me something to that effect , I believe so .

" ' Thanks , Bob . I appreciate what you say . " " It 's the truth . You 've been good for the town , and I guess the town 's been pretty good to you .

" " Well  --  you want to have the meeting in your office ? " " Or your office . But in your office it kind of gets into politics more or less . " " Well , if you want to keep politics out maybe we better forget about Mike Slattery . " " He 's a state senator , do n't forget that . " Conrad laughed . " I do forget it , most of the time . I 'm so used to him being a politician I forget he 's a senator too . " Bob Hooker did not laugh . " And a mighty influential man , Conrad . I do n't have to tell you that . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand you do n't want to run again , so we better take into consideration you may not be Mayor when the campaign gets under way , the campaign for Joe 's memorial , that is . The next mayor may want to stay out of something that was started when you were Mayor . That 's the only thing I was thinking . And these things take time , you know . We do n't want to get started too soon . " " No , and we do n't want to get started too late . " " I understand that , Conrad . " " I 'm ready to start with a thousand dollars right now . " " Mm-hmm . Naturally I 'll get behind it as soon as we have a few meetings and arrive at some decision . " " Uh-huh .

" " All right , " said Conrad Yates . " You 'll be hearing from me , " said Bob Hooker . " Or you 'll be hearing from me , either one , " said Conrad Yates , hanging up . Conrad Yates kept his hand on his telephone while he thought out his next move . His next move was to flip the intercom . " Is Joe Raskin in the building ? " " I do n't know , but I 'll find out , " said his secretary . " I want to see him . " 104In less than a minute his intercom flashed . " I got Joe Raskin . He 's on his way up . " Raskin entered the office . " Hyuh , Mayor , " he said . " What 's cookin ' ? " " I got a little story for you , " said Conrad Yates . " I can use one , " said Joe Raskin , who covered police headquarters and City Hall for the Gibbsville Morning Sun . " I want it to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy , " said Raskin . " You decided to run again ? " " Nothing like that , Joe . But maybe if I like the way you handle this , maybe when I make the other announcement I 'll let you have it first .

" " I ai n't going to give it to the Standard . They can copy it from you , if they want to . " " All right . What is it ? " " Well , Mayor Conrad L. Yates , Mayor of Gibbsville , announces that he is going to donate a thousand dollars , one thousand dollars , to start a memorial in honor of the late Joseph B. Chapin , the distinguishedlawyer and citizen of Gibbsville because I always admired Joe Chapin for being a great citizen and true friend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking notes . " What kind of a memorial ? A statue , or something of that kind ? " " have n't decided . In a few days the Mayor will gather together a group of representative citizens to form a committee to decide about the memorial . Maybe one of them things , a plaque ? Anyway , somethingnice , and I 'll start the ball rolling with a thousand dollars . " Raskin smiled . " What are you sore at Bob I-looker for ? " " Sore at Bob Hooker ? " " lle 's going to be sore at you if this is in the Sun before he can print it . " " No , I just want to make the announcement as soon as possible , " said Conrad Yates . " Get things started . " " Okay by me , " said Raskin . " Any more ? " " That 's all , Joe . Thanks . " " flank you , Mayor , " said Raskin . Joseph B. Chapin was finally dead . They had started fighting over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite old houses oil Lintel ' . engo Street that Gibbsville did not need to have the still older residences of North Frederick Street and South Main . I , antcnrogo Street had houses that were old enough for all sociological purposes , and in fact the more antiquated places of Frederick and South Main were not much older than the landmarks of Lantenengo . Five or six houses on Lantenengo antedated some of the South Main and Frederickhouses . But even in 1909 there was already one marked differencebetween the people who remained on Frederick and South Main , and the people who lived on Lantenengo : it was the difference that no one coming up in the town 's business and social life was moving to Frederick or South Main , while slowly ( and even in 1909 ) the old Frederick and South Main houses were being given up by the families that owned them . A Christiana Street man began to amount to something in Gibbsville , and he moved to Lantenengo Street , to live with the other people who amounted to something . A move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward . In 1909 to build a house beyond 19th Street was considered foolish because it was too far out , and a house on Lantenengo beyond 19th Street was not considered an important symbol . " Anything to live on Lantenengo , " people would say of their Christiana Street neighbors who built in the 19oo-block or past it . A 1900 or 2000 Lantenengo Street address carried no more social prestige locally than a 1900 Park Avenue address in New York . Still it was Lantenengo Street and things were happening in Lantenengo Street ; things that had to do with progress . In 1890 the social outpost had been 16th Street ; in 1909 it was 19th . But in the Twentieth Century nobody wanted to move to North Frederick Street or South Main , and the people who did live in the two oldest residential parts of town were fond of two statements : " I was born here , and I 'm going to die here , " and " When I get my price , that 's when I 'll sell . " The money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases , there was more of it . But it was not the amount of money that mattered in the social scheme of things : Family X , living on Lantenengo Street , might be an old Gibbsville family with money , or might be a Gibbsville family with new money ; but Family Y , living on North Frederick Street or South Main , belonged to the old and the rich of Gibbsville . The abandonment of North Frederick Street and South Main Street in favor of Lantenengo Street and the " Roads " and " Places "  |p106and  " Drives " that were developed on the West Side of Gibbsville during the Twenties , was almost entirely the doing of the young people , the young men and women who were coming to maturity in the second decade of the century . And their abandonment was , by the end of the third decade , so complete that the families that remained in the old houses were either mildly ( or not so mildly ) eccentric , or so old and conservative that their age and conservatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in those houses , into those fatuities that remained ; the grandchildren were being born , but in the new or remodeled houses on Lantenengo Street and the roads . places and drives . ( Or , worse , in one of the Gibbsville hospitals . ) The desertion was so nearly total that even before Mr. Franklin ) . Roosevelt and his ideas arrived in Washington , the old homes on South Main Street and North Frederick had become monumentsof a passing way of life , reluctantly and fearsomely recognized as such by the sons and daughters who had deserted the monuments , ; 111 ( 1 visited only at Christmas and family holidays . The big westward movement paused briefly , but it paused , on October 14 , 1909 , and the temporary halt was caused by the marriage of two of Gibbsville 's best young people . The marriage of Edith Stokes and Joe Chapin was important enough because of the bride and groom and the family connections involved ; but it was in additiona source of satisfaction to those residents of South Main and Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edith Stokes was South Main ; Joe Chapin was North Frederick , and what was more , he was taking his bride to live at Number ro North Frederick , It was just short of a rebuke to the other young people , those who had decided to build or buy on Lantenengo . If North Frederick was good enough for Benjamin Chapin 's son Joe , it was good enough for anyone else in Gibbsville  --  so said the older ones . Joe 's decision earned him their gratitude and their confidence ; the gratitude and confidence of people who gave neither freely . It was especially gratifying to learn of Joe 's decision because as a rich , handsome and young man , and the prince of an old Gibbsville family , he could have lived anywhere he chose and no one would have criticized him . He could have built a California bungalow in the 2100-block , and some excuses would have been found for him . Joe Chapin , as Joe Chapin , took on a sort of ready made popularity among the friends of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of his money , the fact of his good looks , the fact of his choosing to marry a Gibbsville girl , and the fact of his favoring North Frederick Street over Lantenengo , Joe Chapinp107established himself as a young man who could be relied upon not to confuse change with progress , and a young man who would not reject the good things of the past merely because they were of the past . There were those who believed , without insisting upon it , that Edith Stokes was entitled to some of the credit for Joe Chapin 's good sense . For of the qualities of her elders found in Edith Stokes , none was more frequently cited than her good sense . " Edith is a girl with remarkably good sense , " they would say . Nor was it a remark made exclusivelyby the men ; the women said it too . But among the men and women who were slightly inclined toward Joe as between Joe and Edith ( there was , of course , no real controversy ) , it was always pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who had good sense . " Joe could have had any girl in Gibbsville , not mentioningany names , " they would say . " But he had the good sense to pick Edith . " There was no one in Gibbsville , at least no one who counted , who would have been so discourteous as to suggest that Edith 's enormousgood sense might make up for the absence of mere facial beauty . It was still the custom of the North to say of a girl that she looked very pretty today , with no intentional implication that the prettiness was not the case yesterday or likely to be tomorrow . Few girls seriously questioned the compliment , but Edith Stokes was one who never let it pass . " Oh , but I 'm not pretty and I know it , " she would say , saying it with such conviction and such complete lack of coquettishness that her honesty contributed to the general regard for her good sense . Just as it was somehow known , somehow common knowledge without its being discussed , that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most other girls would at least have gone through the motions of enjoying the society of young ladies and gentlemen , friends her own age . But Edith stayed away from the picnics and the boatingparties at The Run , she found excuses to exclude herself from the sleigh rides and chicken-and-waffle suppers . She rode horseback and played tennis , sometimes with young men friends , but the only young man who had ever taken her to an Assembly was the young man whose name she would bear throughout her lifetime . It was never a question of breaking a date to be with Joe Chapin ; when Joe Chapin was in town she would not make dates , so that when he would write her a note , or encounter her on North Main Street , he could always know that whenever he wanted to see her , she would be ready and free . " I do n't consider it quite fair to pretend that you 're keen on a boy when you 're not , and besides , I would n't know the first thing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sense , of honesty and simplicity , so much so that the young man whose approval of her virtues was sought finally approved . She waited for him all through the last years of prep school , of college and law school , hoping to see him , merely to look at him , when he came home for Christmas ( that awful Christmas when he went visiting a college friend in New Orleans and never came home at all ) . She watched the face become more beautiful , the form more perfect , the manner and the manners so polished and easy through his associations and his travels to distant cities that were to her no more than stars on the map . She had no fully developed idea of what she would do with him if she were alone with him and owned him ; her information on the possession of one human being by another was incomplete , based largely on hearsay and logical comparisons of her own body and functions with those of animals . But no man or boy had touched her skin under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the caresses she shared with a girl in her single year at boarding school were pleasant and even exciting , but had no finality , not , at least , to the degree that she knew would be possible if she could own Joe . She had owned the girl in school , had surprised herself by the ease and rapidity of her possession of her . The girl wrote love letters to her , did favors for her , performed menial tasks , and risked expulsion night after night by visiting her curtained bed in the dormitory , but the experience , aside from the immediate pleasure , only confirmed for Edith what she had always half known : that a girl would respond passionately to certain caresses that a man could give , and the man she wanted them from was Joe Chapin , who could also give more , but whatever more or less he could give , it would be Joe Chapin or nobody . Thus what passed for her shyness was actually restraint . Toward other girls it was restraint and superior knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had taken possession of the girl at school convinced her that it would be no more difficult with girls she had known all her life . With young men other than Joe Chapin the curiosity did not become as strong as the desire to own Joe , and in the years just preceding their marriage she became convinced that when she owned Joe she would be owning someone whom no one else had owned . She had acquired a special wisdom about Joe , and one night in her bed , alone with her thoughts , she realized that he had belonged to no one else . He was intact , virginal , uninformed , and innocent . Her own experience , which had taught her much because she was willing to learn , and the new realization of Joe 's virginity , gave her an advantage that Joe could notp109suspect or overcome . After that she was careful , but there was a change in her , and Joe was proud of the change because , he declared , he felt that in a small way he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , indeed , the truth . Joe , she was sure , would have had a talk with his father sometime before the wedding , and the mechanical techniques she could learn from him and with him , but what he did not yet know was that there were depths to passionate expression and when she owned him she would use him to explore those depths . Such pleasures were worth waiting for , and the very idea of riskingthem for the honors and amusements of social intercourse was foolish and absurd . There were friends of Joe 's and of hers who had had relations with women , but they had nothing to offer her . She was more than content to have them think of her as the virgin which technically she was , and the unsuspecting girl that she was not . Moreover , she was content to appear to be naive because her naivete kept them ignorant of her subtle efforts to make them and their bad habits unattractive to Joe . He had gentlemanly standards , but it would have been easy to compromise his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women were an attractive feature of those of his friends who led that kind of life . She encouraged his friendship with Arthur McHenry , which needed no encouragement , but when she was asked to comment on other friends of Joe 's  --  Alec Weeks , for example  --  she would say : " You must n't ask me about people like Alec Weeks . He is your friend , and I do n't like to say anything in criticism of your friends . Women see things in a man that other men do n't . . . Well , if you insist , I ca n't help feeling that he 's sneaky , and I like honorable men . " The effect was as she wanted it to be . Joe did not give up his friendship with the Alec Weeks type of man , but the Alecs were made to seem unattractive and their conduct unworthy of emulation by honorable men like Joe Chapin and Arthur McHenry . She caused Joe to believe that he had chosen his own way of conducting himself , rather than the Alec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior , more fastidious , and , of course , honorable . They had many discussions about honor , in which she encouraged him to repeat so often the conventional observations on the subject that he came close to sounding like its principal champion , if not the inventor of it . Because of the layman 's association of Honor with The Law , which causes an honorable lawyer to appear to be slightly more honorable than anyone else , she was able to speak with genuine conviction when she uttered her admiration for him as a custodian ofp110the principle . She had no knowledge or understanding of the law , and was quick to say so , but in spite of her remoteness from it she theorizedthat the study and practice of law offered a fortunate young man the opportunity to learn and employ secrets about honor that were not available to the layman . IIonor , indeed , became a secondary career in itself . From discussions of honor , in which they were in total agreement , they sometimes proceeded to discussions of religion , and in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , if possible . And since honor could be illustrated with stories of dishonorablebehavior , honor was discussed more frequently and at greater length than religion . Four years at New Haven and the years in the somewhat more inquisitive atmosphere of the Penn Law School had made no apparent change in Joe 's religious belief , which was Episcopal , and Edith 's acceptance of the same faith enabled her to avoid detailed discussion of a topic that is never settled anyway . Their over-all belief , which was not unique at the time , was that friends who professed the Other Protestant religions were likely to be overconcernedwith matters of theology ; that Catholics ( Roman ) were people who had lost control of the beauties of ritual ; and that Jews were strange Biblical characters in modern dress . ' The church they attended , Trinity , was comfortably Low and not vulnerable to little jokes about the Pope and incense . Attendance at Trinity was good numerically and afforded a by no means unpleasant opportunity for weekly contemplation of the relationship with God , in sanctified but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's choosing . In Trinity you were in another world , where the first rule was silence , but you bowed and smiled to your acquaintances as though in that other world you were seeing friends from home . Religion was a comfort ; Trinity was nice . If they talked oftener than most young couples about religion and honor , it was not altogether an accident . During what might be termed the early days of Joe 's courtship Edith was anxious to have him depend upon her for a companionship that she could offer and that would become a habit with him ; a companionship that was not based on qualities that other girls had more abundantly than she . There was , first , her good sense , which everybody knew about . But what everybody did not know about was Joe 's unsureness of himself , that had nothing to do with his good manners . His manners were exquisite even in a day when good manners were the rule . But she became convinced of his unsureness of himself when she had her instinctiverealization of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her and to reveal himself without quite exposing himself . On matters pertaining to the law and honor and religion they were on safe ground ; in her company he became an authority on everything they discussed , and above all they weir not there to argue . They did not argue . More and more he would permit himself to say what he thought , either as simple statement or hope lessly complicated theory . She listened to everything he said and her questions were slight rephrasings of his statements , which proved t c him how attentively she listened and how respectfully she heard . For a year they had no physical contact beyond the clasp of hands , but what she provided was habit-forming and exhilarating and intoxicating . When he left her of an evening she could hear him whistling a Yale marching song and she knew that he was already looking forward to their next meeting . She would wash her face with Roger &; Gallet soap and brush her hair , and lie in her bed and want to own him . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love-making between a man and a woman , as well as fumblingsand acute dissatisfaction ; consequently in her imagination she gave little thought to his pleasure other than to take for granted that since he was a man , his pleasure would come . Her owning him was for her own pleasure ; he would be hers . She never thought that she would be his . It simply never occurred to her to think of herself as his . Whateverhe would do with her  --  caress her , lie on top of her , insert himself in her  --  was part of her wakeful dream of undefined sensuality , of which he was the essential and enormously desirable instrument . She was convinced that he never had seen a live nude woman close to , and she would lock her door and parade herself about her bed , wearing no clothing , and pretend that he was lying on the bed and looking at her for the first time . She had reason to be proud of her figure . It was a time of the long , tailored line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt , blouse and ankle-length coat , following the natural waistline . The design was to make women look tall , with vertical stitching and piping to further the scheme . Edith was an ideal model for the suits and dresses , and even the hats , which were enormous and elaborate ( and expensive ) , were , if not " becoming , " effective in drawingthe attention away from the face that was less than beautiful . No man ever had seen her unclothed , and that too was going to be part ofthe great sensuality when she owned Joe . She was quite aware thatmen of her class expected the girls of her class to be virgins , and inmost cases the expectation was justified . Not knowing exactly what toexpect , limited only by her unlimited imagination , she conductedp112orgies of the mind with herself after an evening with Joe , while at all other times maintaining a calm that was her public character . It was also the character she presented to Joe Chapin ; calm , attentive , interested , sympathetic , eager to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while he became totally dependent upon her without realizing it . Gradually other girls had become , he told her , so frivolous and empty-headed that he was regretting invitations that would involvehis having to be paired off with them . His own friends , too , his contemporaries , were beginning to appear in a bad light ; they were not taking things seriously enough , not buckling down to work , not thinking things through . It was not exactly their fault , he said . They had no one to help them think things through . With this conversationEdith moved into the first stage of owning him . She began to let him do things for her . She would ask him to stop at a shop to pick up something she had ordered . She had him do little errands for her on his visits to Philadelphia . She asked for and took his advice on investinga small sum of cash . She had him read a letter of sympathy she had composed on the death of a far-off cousin . She sought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth she never intended to take . Then , so fortuitously that she would not have dared plan it , she was stricken with acute appendicitis and had to undergo emergency surgery . At that time the appendectomy was years away from the routine operation it was later to become , and a stay in the hospital was likewisea matter for great concern . The newspapers of the day always spoke of a patient as going under the knife , chloroform was the usual anaesthetic , and the word hospital was considered to be suitable evidence of the extremity of the patient 's condition . The horses drawing the ambulance proceeded at a walk or a slow trot , and the ambulance hell , pressed by a large pedal button , was more of an announcement than a warning signal . The doctor and the nurse rode inside with the patient and because of the comparatively slow pace of the team of bays , the citizens were able to have a good look at the faces of the professionals . The faces told little more than the seriousness of their mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself was likely to dispel fear or create optimism . It was a social convention that visits to hospital patients were restrictedto members of the immediate families . This was no less true for patients in private rooms , and it was especially true where the patient was an unmarried young woman . When Joe Chapin read inp113the paper that Edith had been taken to the hospital lie first paicl a cull on Dr. English at the doctor 's office . The doctor revealed that it had been a nasty operation and that Edith had been on the table almost three hours . In the tradition of his calling the doctor employed words of Greek and Latin origin that Joe Chapin was at a loss to understand , but in reply to the direct question Dr. English cautiously admitted that Edith would live , barring unforeseen complications . " When do you think I can go to see her , Bill ? " said Joe Chapin . " Had you intended to go see her ? " " Well , I would like to , if possible . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dr. English . " And you understand , of course , you 'd have to have permission from her family . " " Oh , of course . " " I do n't as a rule encourage visiting , Joe . Edith has a day nurse and a night nurse . She 's still on the critical list , and I should think it 'd be a week before she 'd be ready to see anybody except her family . " " I 'll abide by your decision , but I 'm really very anxious to see her . " " Yes . Yes . That hardly comes as a surprise ; and very understandable . But for the time being I 'm keeping a close watch on her to guard against any post-operative complications , you understand . " " Of course . " " And as a man of the world , you understand that a young lady does n't always look her best in a hospital gown , so there 's that to consider . " " Bill , I have to tell you this . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'm in love with Edith . " " I 'm glad to hear that , Joe . Not altogether surprised , but I 'm glad to hear it . I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I 'll speak to her family and get their permission , and then I 'll ring you up on the telephone , next four or five days . But you must bear in mind , if I do allow you to see her , it will only be for five minutes , and your conversation must be confined to cheerful topics , nothing to upset her or even  --  well , nothing of a romantic nature , either . " " I promise you , not a hint . " " When we have her all well again , time enough then , do n't you agree ? " " By all means , Bill . By all means . " " When the time comes I 'll tell her ahead of time so she 'll have a chance to have the nurse brush her hair and pretty her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's been through quite a siege . And above all , do n't show that you are miserable or unhappy at the way she looks . " On the appointed day Joe Chapin walked to the hospital and stood in the waiting room until a probationer arrived to conduct him to Edith 's room . The odors and the darkness of the corridor and the coughing and the walking patients and the grubby visitors to miningaccidentcases were all new to Joe Chapin . But Edith 's room was not unpleasant , with the bareness relieved by an abundance of flowers . Edith looked up at him from her pillows and raised her lower arm . " Hello , Joe , " she said . " Edith , how good to see you again . " He took her hand for a moment , then let it fall back to the bedcovers . " This is Miss Mcllhenny , my day nurse , " said Edith . " How do you do , Miss McIlhenny . " " Good afternoon , " said the nurse . " Your flowers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? Recognize them ? " " I 'm glad you like them , " said Joe . " It was nice of you to come . " " Nice of me ? Oh , Edith , I 've been trying to ever since you 've been here . How do you feel ? " " Well , much better , thank you . I 've lost track of the days . " " Bill English told me you 're a very good patient . " " Did he ? I do n't think Miss Mcllhenny will agree on that score . " " Indeed I will , she 's been a darling , and never a whimper , " said the nurse . " I have n't much news for you , I 'm afraid . I 've been in court most of the time . Everybody 's asked for you , but I 've been asking them . Every little scrap of information I could get . " " Everybody 's been so kind , especially here in the hospital . They 've done everything for me , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But naturally I 'll be glad when it comes time to go home . " " Do you know when that will be ? " " In another week , I believe . Is n't that so , Miss Mcllhenny ? " ' That 's what we 're hoping . " " Miss Mcllhenny is going with me . Shall I tell him about the bell ? " " Sure , go right ahead if it wo n't embarrass him . " " Did you know that you have to wear an enormous belt after you 've had an operation for appendicitis ? " said Edith.  | " Yes , I guess I 'd forgotten that . " " It has to be made especially , but even so I wo n't be able to ride or play tennis for at least a year . Is n't that discouraging ? " " Oh , no . A year is n't long , " said Joe Chapin . " Oh , I think it is . And I 'm not even supposed to laugh very heart-ily . " " Very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , Joe . You 're a dear . " " Am I , Edith ? " " Yes , you are . " " Well , " said Miss Mellhenny , taking her watch out of her pocket . " If Mr. Chapin wants to come again , he ca n't stay any longer this time . " " Then I 'll go immediately , because I want to come back soon . May I ? " " Oh , I hope you do , " said Edith . She held up her hand and he took it . " Good-bye , Edith , dear , " he said . " Come back soon , " she said . " Thank you , Miss Mcllhenny , " he said , and went out . The nurse followed him . " You done her a world of good , " she said , in the corridor . " I did ? " " And what 's more , I 'm going to say so to Dr. English . You gave her a lift in the spirit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , thank you very much . She 's so pitiful , so weak . " " We almost lost her , you know , and that 's a fine young lady . If she 's your intended , you 're a fortunate man , because I see all kinds and I know . I 'll drop the hint to Dr. English . Good-bye . " " Good-bye , and thank you , " said Joe Chapin . At the first opportunity he went to Philadelphia , to the establishmentof Bailey , Banks &; Biddle , where he made the purchase of a solitaire . It remained in the drawer of his dresser until he had seen the convalescing Edith half a dozen times after her emergence from the hospital . Her strength returned quickly , in spite of a diet consistingchiefly of junket , and on the evening before his actual proposal she began to feel once again in command . " When I was in the hospital do you know what I missed most of all ? " she said . " What ? " " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that , " he said . " Before you came to see me , about a week before , they sent for my family one night . They were sure I was not going to  --  not last through the night . I do n't know whether I overheard something or what it was , but I knew my condition was serious . And that was the only time I cried . I did n't cry with the pains or anything of that sort , but when I thought you and I would never have these lovely talks togetheragain , I was so unhappy that I shed tears , and that is n't like me . " Oh , Edith . " " And that was when I made up my mind that if I ever got well , I would tell you how much our evenings have meant to me . But then when you came to see me , Miss McIlhcnny was there , and I was shy , and weak . But now I can tell you , Joe . Our evenings mean more to me than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edith . As I told you before , I wandered about in a daze . My life was nothing without you , and I was so angry and at the same time felt so futile , not to he able to do something . I slept badly and I ate hardly anything , and finally Arthur caught on and told me to ask for a postponement of the case I was trying , which I did . The other lawyers agreed , very kindly . Arthur 's really a very understandingfriend , you know . " " I know , " said Edith . " I was sorry I could n't see him when I was in the hospital , but I wanted to save my strength for your visits . " " Oh , he understood , Edith . " " I 'm sure he did , " she said . " But now that I 'm getting well again , slowly but surely , I do n't want you to think that you have to go on seeing me and no one else . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean other girls ? " " Yes . Our friendship  --  " " It 's more than a friendship , Edith . You must know that by this time . " " Must I , Joe ? Remember I 'm not going to be able to ride or play tennis or go bathing at The Run for an awfully long time , and I do n't want you to think that our friendship , or whatever you wish to call it , gives me the right to monopolize you . " " Edith , you do n't think the horseback riding and tennis are all that 's important to me ? It 's being with you that matters , dear . " " It matters to me . Oh , Joe , I should n't say this , but sometimes in the hospital I longed for you . " " Edith , my darling , " he said . He kissed her mouth and her eyes , and again her mouth.  | " We must n't now , " she said . " My dearest . " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Yes , " she said . " And I love you . That 's what I was saying when t said I longed for you . With all of me , Joe . You are the only man t hat could make me happy , just being with you . You must go now . Please , darling . " " Yes , " he said . " I know , my dearest . " " I wo n't see you to the door . Just let me sit here . " He got up . " Tomorrow evening , my dearest ? " " Yes , " she said . The next evening they greeted each other with smiles and when he sat beside her he took the solitaire out of its velvet box . " I want to show you something , " he said . " Oh ...  --  " Oh , it 's a ring , of course . But I want to show you the box . Look at it . " " Bailey , Banks &; Biddle , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to propose , I hope . " " But the name of Bailey 's , does n't that tell you anything else ? " " I guess I 'm not very deep . " " My dearest . You know I have n't been to Philadelphia . Now do you deduce ? " " You 've had the ring ? " " Exactly , dearest . I bought it weeks ago , hoping . " " I 'm waiting , dearest , and I think you know the answer . " " Will you marry me , Edith ? " " Oh , my darling , of course I 'll marry you . " She held back her head and he kissed her . " Try it on , " he said . " It fits perfectly , perfectly , and how lovely , what a beautiful diamond . Exquisite . I have a present for you , too . " " Did you know I was going to propose ? " " Hoped . I 've been hoping . Of course I 've been hoping all these months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . And when we did  --  I went out today , shopping . " She got up and went to the spinet desk . She handed him a small package . " Open it . " He did so , and held up a moonstone stickpin . " Edith , what a beauty ! " " Do you like it ? " " It 's  --  perfect . You 've noticed that I needed one . " " Yes , you lost the one you got at graduation. "  | " Will you put it on for me ? " " Of course , dearest . I 'm so glad you like it . " " Like it ! I 'll treasure it the rest of my life . " " And I my solitaire . Is n't this a happy evening , Joe ? " " It is , dearest , " he said . She put on the stickpin . " What are you frowning for ? " he asked . " Was I frowning ? I did n't mean to show it . I just remembered my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . I do n't like very long engagements , do you ? " " I 've never had one , " he said . " Oh , Joe , seriously . " " I 'm sorry , dearest . " " I never thought of it , but we have to , do n't we ? " " Yes , " he said . " That side of marriage is  --  a complete mystery to me . " " I know , dearest . " " You will have to  --  I must learn everything from you . Men always know , do n't they ? " " Yes , we find out . " " Shall I ask Billy English ? He 's really not so much older than we are . I did n't mind his operating on me , that was different . But this is  --  do you think I could go to that new doctor , that woman ? Dr. Kel-lems ? " " If you prefer , dearest . I could ask Bill English . He knows I 'm in love with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could ask him how soon we can get married and we would n't have to go into details . " " I wish you would . That would make it so much easier for me . See him and ask him before we announce our engagement . " " Bill 's a gentleman , but he 's a doctor too , and he has to meet this situation every day . Look at all our friends that go to him . " " That 's true , " she said . " Oh , dearest , I 'm so pleased . " " And I , " he said . " Mrs. Joseph Benjamin Chapin , " she said . " Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Benjamin Chapin , " he said . " Yes , " she said . In Gibbsville , in 1909 , only a few men could tell with exactnessthe true wealth of the wealthy Gibbsville families . A family that had assets worth $800,000 could , and usually did , live in great comfort without spending much more money than a family worthp119$200,000 . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live comfortably , but without the kind of display that would publicly reveal the extent of their wealth . A few families , whose names were given to large holdings in coal lands and to breweries and meat-packing houses , lived in American luxury . They were the owners of the early motor cars . They employed the larger staffs of servants . They had summer homes at distant resorts and led the lists of contributors to church and charity . Their wealth was a known fact and they were free to enjoy it . But behind them , obscured by the known wealthy , were the well-off , who possessed considerable fortunes and who quietly ran the town . The Benjamin Chapins were one such family . They lived within their income , they bought only the best and they bought to last . They ordered the more expensive cuts of meat , but they watched their butcher bills and they would hold up payment over a single lamb chop . In their home was a kind of restfulness ; all that was needed was there , and nothing would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required for permanent improvement . The lighting fixtures had been installed for gas ; when electricity was decided upon , the fixtures were converted , not taken down . Every room in the Frederick Street house was given a good cleaning once a week , and repairs were made promptly and by men and women with special skills . When something went wrong it was rectified before it got worse , whether it was a broken breeching strap or a brick in the sidewalk . Woodwork , furniture , silverware and brasses were worn smooth in the Chapin household and everything was always in its place because its place had been carefully decided upon at the very beginning . The Benjamin Chapins made no compromise with taste as they felt it or quality as they understood it . With those principles to guide them , they also privately believed , privately but firmly , that the very fact that an object was owned by them made it all right , good enough for anyone and too good for most . For the Benjamin Chapins were convinced of their own superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they always were able to reaffirm their self-appraisal . Benjamin Chapin 's wife was born Charlotte Hofman , a Gibbsville , Pennsylvania , Hofman , and therefore connected with the Muhlenbergs , the Womelsdorfs , the Montgomerys , the Laubachs , the Penns , the Boones , and the Leisenringers , the FitzMaurices , the Blooms , the Dickinsons , and the Pennsylvania Lees . Charlotte Hofman was only twenty when she married Benjamin Chapin , who was thirty-four , butp120she was quite aware that towns and counties had been named after members of her family and that noble German blood flowed in her veins . She was a woman with a live sense of her duty to the past and the future , a conviction that her body was the inheritor of elements that needed only proper fertilization for the breeding of a superior offspring . She was small , dark , and pretty , and rich , and had many suitors . She accepted Ben Chapin because he was old enough in Pennsylvanialineage to have connections almost as imposing as her own , and earlier New England connections that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own qualities , he was healthy and honest and well liked by the major stockholders of the Coal &; Iron Company . She married Ben Chapin in 1881 and their son , whom they called Joseph Benjamin Chapin after Ben 's father , was born in the succeeding year . The first was the only child to live ; he was followed by two stillborn babies , the second of them badly deformed , and after the birth of the sub-normal child Charlotte Chapin withdrewalmost completely from society and devoted herself to the fancyworkat which she was proficient and the raising of her son . Her son grew quickly and tall , and ever closer to his mother . He displayed admiration and respect for his father , but demonstrations of affection were reserved for his mother . As he grew taller she would make him sit on the footstool so that she could rumple his fine brown hair , which was silky and straight and unruly until he went to Yale and slicked it down . Throughout his prep school years in Pottstown , the four years in New Haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe wrote his mother twice weekly without fail . His letters were slangy and largely in a humorous vein , often padded with scores of athletic contests and university notices that were extracted from the college newspaper , but also providing a fair chronological record of his social and scholastic activities , and keeping her informedof his friendships and what he called his hateships . He wrote to his father only when it was necessary , as for accounting purposes and for permission to change college courses and take trips , and to tell him that he was going to join Alpha Delta Phi , his father 's fraternity . He went out for the freshman crew and for the varsity eight in his sophomore year and almost made the tennis team , but among his friends athletic prowess was not regarded as the thing , any more so than conspicuous brilliance as a scholar or success as a heeler of other extra-curricular activities . In his letters from New Haven and from Philadelphia , Joe Chapin mentioned girls ' names only when they were to be , or had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition of his college and his day , Joe referred to girls as women , making generalizations about women that characterized the entire sex as foolish or romantically cruel , and in any case to be avoided . The attitude , of course , pleased his mother . She seldom lost an opportunity to point out that she had married his father when Ben Chapin was thirty-four . Women , she generalized , aged more rapidly than men ; a man ought to marry a much younger woman ; a man of forty was still a young man , a woman of forty was well along in years . She did not touch upon the subject of the menopause as such , but she convinced her son that to marry before thirty was to take on burdensome responsibilities that could easily thwart a young lawyer 's career , and unnecessarily at that , since a man had all his life in which to raise a family . Impersonally , without mentioning any names , Charlotte Chapin would remind her son that the girls he was seeing during his college years were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was , she said , all the time in the world before getting serious . The campaign was enormously successful , not only in the way she had planned , but in a way she could not have thought of . Joe Chapin , fixing on no particular girl , increased his popularity because he was equally attentive to all girls . He was handsome , he had nice manners , he was graceful , lie dressed well , he seemed to have money , he was a member of Wolf 's Head , he was considerate of his elders , and he laughed readily . At the same time he was not a fop or effeminate , nouveau riche , or patronizing with the parents of the girls he saw . A few of the fathers dismissed him as a snob , but there was one New York mother who lightened that characterization : " But what has he got to be snobbish about ? He 's from Pennsylvania . " Joe 's own father had unintentionally prepared the way for his son . There were men in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and remembered him as a worthwhile fellow who had made no enemies , had got into no scandal , and of whom they would say to Joe : " I think I must have known your father . Was he a Yale man , about the Class of ' 68 or ' 69 ? " It was easy , in those days of more difficult transportation , for a New York man to lose touch with fellows he had known in college , and it was especially easy with a fellow like Ben Chapin , who had left a favorable but not an indelible impression . Chapin , moreover , was not an extraordinarily uncommon name . Thus when the personable young man turned out to be the son of Ben Chapin , ' 69 , the boy 's attractiveness was of a safe kind : nothing dangerous could possibly have been sired by oldp122Ben , and if the boy wanted to be a bit of a snob , well , that was a more self-respecting characteristic than if he had chosen to be a rounder and a roue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any old friends of mine ? " Ben once asked his son . " In New York , I mean . " " Yes , Father . Oh , yes . " " Who , for instance ? Frank Garth , for instance ? He lives in New York . And a doctor named Ralph Dole ? " " Dole , let me see . No , I do n't think so , Father . " " What about Frank Garth ? " " Well , I 'm not sure . Frank Garth . Mr. Blaine . I met a Mr. Blaine that asked me if you were my father . " " Oh , really ? L. B. Blaine ? That Blaine ? " " L. B. ? Yes , Mr. Lewis Blaine . " " Is that so ? I never knew him very well . I 'm rather surprised he remembers me . He was in Skull &; Bones . Family had a big place at City Island . Very well-to-do people . I have n't seen Lew Blaine in over twenty years . Guyon Bardwell . Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staten Island , and I imagine still does . " " Bardwell . No , I do n't think so , although I did go to Staten Island this year . It 's a beautiful place . " " Beautiful . I used to visit the Bardwells there . Guyon Bardwell had a sister Amy , married a classmate of ours from Chicago . My , it 's a long time since I 've thought about some of these people . Do you realize it was only a short time after the Civil War ? If the war 'd continued a few years longer , I 'd have been in it . " " Yes , I know . " " Lew Blaine . He had a brother Ivan , and I 've often wondered why they chose a Russian name . We had sonic very interesting fellows in our class . For two years I was the only Gibbsville boy at Yale . I think that 's the only time that ever happened , that only one Gibbsvilleboy was at Yale . Scranton , Reading , Harrisburg . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . Fellows like Lew Blaine had never heard of Gibbsville . " ' They still have n't , " said Joe Chapin . " I 've often found it saves time and useless explanation if you just say you 're from Philadelphia . " " You do ? Why did you do that ? " " To save time and useless explanation . " " But I do n't think it would have been useless explanation . There 's such a thing as polite curiosity , you know , and if someone is curiousp123enough to ask you where you came from , they probably arc polite enough to , and curious enough to , listen while you tell them . Now how much more interesting you 'd have been if instead of aligning yourself with the large crowd of Philadelphia boys , you told them in you were from Gibbsville . All those people know all about Philadelphia , but they do n't know a thing about Gibbsville . " " That 's exactly my point , Father . " " Then you should have told them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small town in the Pennsylvania coal region . Not even as big as Scranton . " " Not even as big as Wilkes-Barre , either . But not the same as Scranton , not the same as Wilkes-Barre . " " If I started to expatiate on the glories of Gibbsville I 'm afraid my audience would turn away . " " Then I 'm afraid I have a low opinion of their manners , a very low opinion indeed . And if all they 're interested in is New York and , Philadelphia and Boston , then I wo n't give them much credit for their intelligence . It is n't where a man comes from that counts . . . " " Yes , but Father , that 's my point . Would you consider it polite if I were to bore my friends with a description of the town I happened to be born in ? " " And your mother and I , both your grandfathers and both of your grandmothers , and their fathers and mothers . " " But some of those New York people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far that I 'd run out of greats . " " Well , in my day they were ladies and gentlemen , and if they asked a man where he came from , they had the good manners to let him answer their question . And they might learn something into the bargain . " " Well , I suppose I 'll have to tutor in Gibbsvilliana . I 'm not even sure of the population . " " No , you wo n't have to tutor , but you might brush up on your own manners , starting with more respect for your father . " " I 'm sorry , Father . " " I trust you are , and I accept your apology . " " Thank you . " " And the population of Gibbsville is 17,000 , mostly English , German , Welsh and Irish stock . " " Thank you . " " And it 's a very good town to live in , as I hope you 'll find out some day . "  |p124The  conversation , which took place in the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn Law School , was typical of the Chapin father-and-son colloquies . They would begin amiably enough , but nervous impatience would set in , followed by sarcasm and apology , and the father 's attempts at humor usually came too late . Ben Chapin away from his legal work was of the loneliest of men . The vigorousness of which his wife spoke to their son as being present in men of middle age was present in Ben Chapin , but after the second stillbirth she never returned to Ben 's bed . There was no dramatic scene , there was no theatrical announcement , and there was only one conversation . " Charlotte , " said Ben one evening , " ca n't we go back to sharing our room together again ? " " I do n't think so , Ben . " " I miss you . " " I know , and I miss you , but you know what 's bound to happen . And if I 'm not there , it wo n't happen . " " But I 'm not an old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not a dead woman . But I would be if I had to go through another confinement and the same thing happened . " " I see . Yes , I see . " For the next ten years Ben paid visits at irregular intervals to a whorehouse on Arch Street , Philadelphia , where he would get slightly drunk before going to bed with one of the women , and wholly drunk afterward . The place was expensive because of the vigilance of the man and woman who owned it . If a girl was known to be diseased , she was fired ; if she spoke to a patron on the street , she was fired . And a new patron had to be introduced in person by an old patron . Young men in their twenties , no matter who they were , were not admitted , but there was no limit above thirty . The girls submitted to or participated in any perversion that did not involve the drawing of their blood or the burning of their flesh . Ben Chapin was a simple man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept o ( I his drunkenness he would return to his hotel for a day or two until he was able to go back to Gibbsville and face his wife without showing ; his hatred of her . Then after ten years of the visits to Arch Street the need became less urgent and was dissipated in his dreams . He had one experience in a Washington hotel that put an end to his overt sexual life . He had gone to the dining room for breakfast and was again in his room , lying on the unmade bed and reading his newspaper . He dozed off ,  |p125and  was awakened by the chambermaid 's key in the door . When the door opened he saw her , a handsome Negress of thirty or more . " Come here , " he said . " I be back , sir . " " Come here . " " I ca n't . I be fired . " " I 'll give you five dollars . " " No , sir . Ten dollars . " " All right , ten dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Wutta you goin ' do to me ? " " You know what I 'm going to do to you . " " You goina hurt me ? " " I 'm not going to hurt you . Take off your clothes , quick . " She obeyed him , and lay on the bed . " You take off your clothes ? " " No , " he said . He managed to get inside her a matter of secondsbefore it was over . " All right , now go . " " That all ? I want my ten dollars . " " I 'll give you your ten dollars , just go . " " Yes , sir . You want me to come back ? " " No , God damn it , just put your clothes on and go . " " Cap'n , I do ' want you angry with me . I ca n't he'p it if you too quick . Quick or slow , I can still get in the family way . " It was the only completely uncontrollable surging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as nothing had ever frightened him . He was not afraid of blackmail ; he knew that a blackmailing chambermaid had no chance . But there was nothing in his past experience that had warned him of himself as a potential rapist . His relations had been entirely with Charlotte , and with the Arch Street whores , and if anything Charlotte was more freely passionate than the paid women . He never had had to consider rape as a kind of trouble he might get into . But he knew in all honesty that if the chambermaid had not submitted for money , he would have taken her violently . It was a real danger now , and the risk governed his thinking in relation to all women . And thus the chambermaidbecame the last woman to receive the seed that reposed in the body of Ben Chapin . It was a secret he was often tempted to tell his wife . But he was not altogether sure that he wanted to take revenge upon her . He knew that Charlotte was making him old and souring his final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason was too subtle for her to discover ; it was not only the fear of givingp126birth to an idiot or dead child ; it was her obsession with her son and his life . Ben was acquainted with the crime of incest , and the absence of incestuous practice did not remove the possibility of an incestuousdesire , no matter how monstrously preposterous the idea might seem to Charlotte ( and , until the years of denial , to Ben ) . As Ben 's hatred became a real and final thing he grew to see that Charlotte was a limited , if not a stupid , woman , and that the boy was a handsome and bright creature , but lacking in warmth . Joe was not cold , for the cold ones can be passionate too . But he was lacking in warmth . Some nights in his bed , trying for sleep , afraid to drink himself drunk because he was afraid to rape his wife  --  Ben would fancy that perhapshis revenge upon Charlotte would come through the boy himself , through his lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see it , but it might come . And when he discovered that ironic possibility , that the loving mother might stiffer through the well-loved son , Ben began to sleep a little better . A married couple always presents an absurdly untruthful picture to the world , but it is a picture that the world finds convenient and a comfort . A couple are a man and a woman , and what goes on between them the world never knows , could not possibly know , does not anxiously want to know , unless the man and the woman are so spectacularly unhappy that the private events become public knowledge . But what is conveniently and comfortably regarded as a happy couple is accepted as such so long as the couple appear as a unit and refrain from revealing the slightest disturbance . The mistake a couple can make is to let the outside world inside for a brief second 's look at a brief second of unhappiness . Then the unity is broken and the world demands to know more , and if there is no more at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who can breathe and love , can breathe and hate as well , and as they do they provide the world with the satisfied curiosity that it demands before passing on to something else . Ben Chapin 's whores and his chambermaid had an outside look at the inside of the Ben Chapin marriage , but the whores and the mercenary chambermaid were a special unhappy world of their own , and so deep and selfish in their unhappiness that they cared nothing about the misery of a stranger . In that respect Ben Chapin and his wife were fortunate ; the uncaring whores and the chambermaidwere the only ones who had been given an inside look . The rest of the world saw a happy couple , a long-established happy couple who might even be asked for recipes and formulas for the creation of a happy marriage . In their own small family , in the person of theirp127only son , there was a candidate for happy marriage who wanted the benefit of their advice and experience . So carefully had the Chapins as a couple maintained the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had not questioned the veracity of the picture . And in that respect the Chapins were entitled to their belief in their superiority ; they kept their secrets from the world ; t hey made the world believe what they wanted the world to believe . In worldly terms they had a highly successful , a model , marriage . Indeed , they appeared to demonstrate successful marriage in a day when publicly unsuccessful marriages were exceptional . Among their close acquaintances there were occasional evidences of infelicitous marital relationships , usually blamed on the husband 's drunkenness ; but divorce had not occurred in the American history of the Chapin and the Hofman families . Under the unwritten rules of the time , Ben could have beaten and raped his wife with impunity ; the screams of violently abused women were heard not only in the poorer districts of the town , where , to be sure , they were heard more frequently . But in accordance with the superiority they felt , Ben and Charlotte Chapin adhered to the ladylike and gentlemanly code which regulatedall social activity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of procreation . A gentleman did not force his attentionson a lady ; the lady protected the gentleman 's pride by pleading a splitting headache or by telling him that it was her time of the month . In the case of Ben and Charlotte Chapin the code actually did regulate their conduct , had regulated it throughout the early years of their marriage , so that when Charlotte made the announcement that began the years of denial , Ben was already accustomed to accedingto her wishes . He conformed because that was what he believed ; he never gave any thought to the fact , and it was a fact , that if he had disregarded her wishes , she would have had no one to turn to . She would not have confided in anyone , she would not have cried for help , she would not have left him . They were living in a time when it was unthinkable for a woman of Charlotte 's background to confide to another woman that her husband had seen her breasts . More explicit confidences were more unthinkable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , to all outward appearances , the successful marriage of the father and mother of Joe Chapin . The demonstrated affection between the son and the mother was considered by their friends and relations to be a most desirable state of affairs . The love of a mother for her son was taken forp128granted ; but while a son was expected to love his mother , only a few sons were so palpably devoted as Joe Chapin was to Charlotte . Other sons might be reasonably polite and respectful ; Joe Chapin was courtly . Other mothers envied Charlotte and made efforts to inspire their own sons to emulation of Joe , but whenever the mothers started , they started too late . Charlotte was fond of saying that all the time she was carrying Joe she had known she would have a son and that he would be beautiful and brilliant ( she did not go so far as to claim that she knew her next two pregnancies would be failures ) . An irreverent member of the household staff said that you would have thought it was Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's foreskin was cut . Throughout Joe 's boyhood Charlotte supervised every detail of his life ; his health , his schooling , his playtime , his friendships . Nor was anyone else allowed to punish him . When he was small she spanked his behind ; when he grew taller she made him hold out his hand for slaps with a footrule . But in spite of the corporal punishment the relationship was not endangered . It would have been a very stupid child who did not notice that corporal punishment was always followed by a gift , or by special privilege . Charlotte 's supervision of Joe 's activities entirely relieved the boy 's father of most paternal responsibilities , and particularly the responsibility of punishment . But as a consequence Ben was hardly more than a nominal , although an actual , father . He and the boy shared a roof and not much else , and after Joe went to boarding school , even the roof was less often shared . Joe 's allowance was determined by Charlotte and sent by her . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowances , and then in June , because he had passed to a higher grade , she would write off the borrowing . " What do you do with your money ? " she asked him in the prep school clays . " Oh  --  spend it . " " But what on ? Do you treat the other boys ? " " I should say not  --  well , when it 's my turn I do , but not like Fothergill . He 's a boy from Chicago that always wants to treat everybody . He thinks he can buy people . " " I 'm glad to hear you do n't do that , my dear . " " I should say not . " " But what do you do with your money ? Do you play cards ? "  | " Oh , sure I play cards , but not for money . They 'd ship Inc home if they found that out . " " And you 're much too young to drink . " " Do n't be too sure about that , Mummy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do ? At The Hill ? " " Oh , but I would n't tell you who they are . " " No , I do n't want you to be a tattletale . " " I want to get the gold watch Father promised me , so you do n't have to worry about me drinking till I 'm twenty-one . " " When you go to Yale you may drink wine . You 'll be invited out to dinner and they 'll serve wine . I have to speak to your father about that . But no spirits . " " Can I drink beer ? " " I do n't know . I 've wondered about that . We 'll see if it 's the custom . I do n't want people to think you 're strange . Let 's get back to the money . What do you spend it on ? Your clothing bills come to us . " " Well , I bought two sweaters . One was two and a half and the other was three dollars . And pennants for my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , things like that , I buy that sort of thing . Let me see , we chipped in to buy a present for the baseball coach . " " That was nice . What else ? " " It 's really very hard to say . But we always have these little expenses . They take up a lot of collections . And when we have a spread . And sweaters and baseball gloves . And just ordinary gloves . I 'm always losing gloves  --  or other boys swipe them . " " Well , I can see that I 'm not going to find out what becomes of our money . Just as long as you do n't spend it on the wrong things . That 's really what I wanted to inquire . And always buy the best . There 's almost no such thing as a bargain . " " Oh , I believe in buying the best . " " Your father and I have always believed in that . " " Father ? I knew you did , but I often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know where you got that idea . Such as ? " " Oh -- I do n't know . We 're richer than the McHenrys , but Arthur 's house is nicer than ours . " " Do n't ever say that again , do you hear me ? "  | " Well , they have newer things . " " I 'm not objecting to what you said about this house . I am objecting to what you said about the McHenrys and us . " " But are n't we richer ? " " I do n't know  --  yes , we arc , but what if we are ? Where did you hear that ? " " Arthur 's father told Inc . That 's what he always says when I have something and Arthur has n't . He says we can afford things because we 're richer . " " I 've never heard of Arthur being deprived of anything . " " I know . It 's just because Mr. McHenry is stingy and you 're not . He 's terribly stingy , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use words like stingy when you 're speaking of your elders , I do n't care who they arc . " " But that 's what he is . " " I said I do n't like you to use that word . " " I did n't . I just said that 's what he is , I did n't use the word . " The , you 're clever , you 're very clever . You are going to be a lawyer . " " When T am I hope I 'll be a better one than some people . " " Now ! Not another word ! " " Why , Mummy ? You do n't know who I was thinking of . " The expression , the wrong side of the tracks , never caught on in Gibbsville . A Gibbsville citizen would know only too well that so long as a single Chapin lived on Frederick Street , " the wrong side " was much righter than the opposite side ; the expression would have no meaning . The numbered and tree-named streets of Gibbsville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known as anything but the addresses of the middle-class and the poor . There were two kinds of people on Frederick Street ; there were the old-rich , whose families had made it an important address  --  and there were the others . The old-rich as well as the others had to pass through the same ugly part of the town on their way to shop , to the bank , to the doctor 's office , to social engagements on the west side of the railroad tracks . It had been that way even before the railroads arrived ; in the days of the Old Canal that part of town had been a section that a lady on foot did not linger in . As in every town , as in nearly every city , the railroad station area became a tough area , infested with thieves and procurers , whores and hoodlums . Gibbsville was like anyp131other American town in that the first impression and the last impressionit created was that the traveler would have been safer at except that in the traveler 's home town conditions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street of the dives ; the intersection of Christiana Street and Railroad Avenue was the local capital of crime and violence . Through this district Charlotte Chapin had to pass on her way to Main Street . Her visits to Main Street were infrequent ; her visits on foot were rare , since she always had a carriage or a cutter at her disposal . And her walks past Christiana and Railroad , unescorted , were rarer still . But they did occur . She never forgot either one of them , and there were only two . She was twenty years of age and a recent bride , in the spring of 1881 , and on a certain warm and bright afternoon she announced to the coachman that she would walk to Mr. Chapin 's office , and that Connelly , the coachman , could meet her there instead of following the original plan , which was for Connelly to drive her to the office , meet Mr. Chapin and from there drive to a wedding at Trinity Church . " Will I folly you with the carriage , ma'am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm not going to faint . " " Christiana and Railroad , ma'am , " said Connelly . " I hardly think I 'm going to be accosted in broad daylight , " said Charlotte Chapin . " I 'm always prepared for the worst contingency , ma'am , " said Connelly . " Thank you for looking out for me , Connelly , but nothing 's going to happen . " She smiled at Connelly , whom she liked . " You 're welcome , ma'am , but you wo n't mind if I do folly you . The Mister 'd skin me alive if I did n't . " " All right , " she said . She set out on her stroll and all went well until she came to the corner of Christiana and Railroad , the northwest corner , which was occupied by Dutch Amringen 's saloon . The swinging doors had been installed for the summer and there was a large picture of a billy goat on a weather-worn sign reading Bock Beer On Sale which was swinging at the entrance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the places of business in that block , and while that was not an unusual condition in Gibbsville , it had the effect in that neighborhood of making the passerby feel he was closer to the inside of Amringen 's and places like it than he ever mightp132venture . The cigar butts and fresh tobacco juice on the brick sidewalkwere a peril to the long-skirted and dainty . It was too early in the day for the songs and loud talk that were to be heard nightly in that block on Christiana Street , but voices from the saloons could be heard , rough laughter and heavily masculine conversations . A few were in front of Dutch Amringen 's , smoking stogies and spitting tobacco juice , while comfortably seated on beer barrels . And as always the foot traffic in that block was made to seem heavier because so many men stood along the curb and the building line , and others chatting in the middle of the sidewalk made passersby walk around them . It was an atmosphere in which every respectable citizen was regarded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half drunk , dressed in his poor best and with newly trimmed red hair and beard , came out of Rinaldo 's barber shop as Charlotte Chapin reached the entrance to Dutch Amringen 's next door . At first he seemed to be trying to make way for Charlotte , but as lie moved to his right , she moved to her left , and when she moved to her right , he moved to his left . " Girlie 's playing , " said the man . " Give us a little kiss . " " Get out of my way , you disgusting man , " said Charlotte . " Get outa my way , you disgusting man . You got a pretty little pussy ? Have you ? " Now he was deliberately blocking her way . " Get  --  out ! " she said . " Me see your little pussy , " said the man . She quickly turned and would have gone back toward home , but the loafing men had almost immediately noticed the scene and were laughing loudly . The red-bearded man was encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that moment Connelly , who had been following Charlotte in the victoria , jumped from the box and brought the loaded end of his whip down on the redhairedman 's skull . The man sank to the sidewalk , bleeding . Charlotteran to the carriage . Connelly , brandishing the whip , backed to the carriage , remounted the box and they drove away . They reached Main Street before the loafing men could organize an attack on Connelly , and no attack was made . For many of the loafing men there was a police deadline halfway between Railroad Avenue and Main Street , and to go beyond the deadline meant automatic arrest , thirty days in the county prison , and dreadful beatings between arrest and sentencing . Consequently the deadline was carefully observed . " I 'll get Constable Morgan , " said . Connelly.  | " You 'll do no such thing , " said Charlotte . " But thank you , Con-nelly . " " We better have him arrested . He wo n't be hard to recognize , with that broken head o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know him ? " " Never laid eyes on him in me life before , " said Connelly . " Do n't go to Mr. Chapin 's office just now . I want to think . " " You 'll excuse me , ma'am , but maybe you 've got too muchspunk . " " I do n't want you to say a word to Mr. Chapin , not a single word . Do you hear ? I 'll be very , very cross , do you hear , Connelly ? " " I hear , ma'am . " " You hear , but I want you to heed as well as hear . Now we can drive to Mr. Chapin 's office . " Connelly did not report the episode until later in the evening , first extracting a near-promise from Ben Chapin that he would say nothing to Charlotte . Neither Ben nor Charlotte ever discussed the incident , but Connelly from that day on was never without a pistol , and the bearded man , a mule-skinner at one of the mines , was arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorderly . His absence cost him his job , although in time he was able to find employment elsewhere in the coal region . Connelly , too , moved away after a few years . He was a sober man , not given to frequenting saloons , but he and his wife found that many of their friends stopped speaking to them , and would not sit in the same pew at Mass if they saw the Connellys first . Connelly became known as a spy , a vague term but the worst thing an Irishman could call another Irishman . Six years passed before Charlotte again walked beneath the wooden awning in front of Dutch Amringen 's . In 1888 she was hoarding the Gibbsville train at Philadelphia , and a car 's length ahead of her on the platform she could see  --  and instantly recognize  --  the red-bearded man , carrying a satchel and apparently about to take the same train . The next day she walked past Amringen 's saloon on her way to Main Street and on her way home from Main Street , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit to herself the real reason for her curiosity about the man . She was , however , able to deny that the real reason was deeper than curiosity . In the long nm the denial amounted to the admission , for Charlotte Chapin was not a stupid woman . She was a far from stupid woman . From among her numerous suitors she had selected the man who , besides all the obvious eligibili/ties of family and money , offered the least likelihood of opposition to what she wanted out of life . Ben Chapin was not likely to make demands on her person ( and her guess proved correct ) , but he was physically fit to reveal to her the mysteries of the bed . She was the purest of virgins , but she could not accept the conventional belief that love-making was enjoyed by the man alone , a distasteful preliminaryto the holy joy of motherhood . She believed in God , and it did not seem to be a part of the divine kindness to give the male sex all of the pleasure and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been stimulated by touches of a young man 's hand on her own hand , and when she relived the experience in her active mind , she conceded that the excitement was not confined to the hand . The desire to be touched again was something she felt in her body , between her shoulders and her knees . She was not given to exchanges of confidences with her contemporaries , and as a consequenceshe took in less misinformation than she might have . The logic of sexual apparatus was apparent to her in her girlhood , and the only major surprise she received from Ben was in the difference between a passionate living man and pictures of soft cherubim . It was Ben 's bad luck to be the father of the stillborn babies , and thus to become associated with the tragedies as wholly or partly to blame . It made little difference to Charlotte whether she blamed Ben or the act of love-making ; the man and the act became the one thing , and it was an abhorrent thing . What was worse for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs were satisfied with another woman , so long as no scandal was involved . In the first years of their marriage she had been possessively jealous when Ben would innocently flirt with another girl . She never quite loved him with the great finality of love , but there was in the beginning enough pleasure in his company and in the state of wifehood to make the relationship live . The mess and the pain of the second stillbirth likewisekilled the relationship for her , and she had sufficient excuse to make her announcement . Things had not turned out quite as she had planned when selectingBen to be her husband , but now , after the second dead baby , she gave up her husband and devoted herself to her son . It was a new start , but she was getting what she wanted . She had her home , her position in relation to her fellow man , and she had her son . She had a husband who would complacently supply an official parenthood , without interfering in the upbringing of the son . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in thisp135houseful of good manners she encountered no resistance to her acts and methods . And just as though she had done it dclibcratcly ( which she had not ) , she destroyed any love between the boy and his father . The father was made to seem just short of a fool ; the son was nude to seem just short of sacred . The years went by . Christmases would come and presents would be exchanged at a most elaborately festooned fireplace , and lien instituted , but after two tries dropped , the custom of reading A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens . On the Fourth of July they would go to Ben 's office to watch the parade of the Grand Army of the Republic , and Joe would be taken to a children 's picnic at The Run . Foley , the coachman who succeeded Connelly , instructed the boy in the arts of riding and driving and introduced him to strong language . The father helped the son with his arithmetic and algebra and first-year Latin , but the mother supervised the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to his reading , making him repeat the readings so that she could correct the Pennsylvania Dutchisms that occurred in his speech . Her own accent was refined and precise as a result of the influence of an English nanny , and she was determined to protect Joe as much as possible from the singsongydelivery that was more or less common to Gibbsville children who were not Irish . Ben 's speech was plain , closer to New EnglandYankeethan any other influence , although he pronounced his r 's . On such matters as the knotting of a cravat and gentlemanly jewelry Ben was allowed authority , but the only thing he ever really taught the boy was how to swim . Ben came home from the office one July day when Joe was six years old . It was noon , time for dinner . " Good morning , Father , " said the boy . " Mother has a headache . " " Oh , " said Ben . Foley 's sister , Martha , entered the sitting room and announced that Mrs. Chapin had a headache and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , " said Ben . " Tell your brother to put Blackie in the cut-under and bring him around to the front door . Right away , please , Martha . " " Will you be having your dinner now , sir ? " " No . Just do as I tell you , please . " " Where are you going , Father ? " " I 'll tell you in a minute . Is your mother asleep ? " " I do n't know . I guess so . " " Well , tiptoe upstairs and see , and come right down and tell me. "  |p136The  boy was unaccustomed to orders , but he did as directed and returned to report that his mother was asleep . " We 're going for a drive , you and I. " " You and I , Father ? " " Yes . " " I did n't ask Mummy . " " I 'll leave word . I 'll write her a note . She wo n't be worried . " " Yes she will , Father . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where are we going ? " " It 's a surprise . " Ben was writing the note to Charlotte . " What kind of a surprise ? " " A nice one , " said Ben . " Now do n't ask me any more questions till I 've finished this note . " " Arc we going away somewhere ? " " Hmm ? " " Where are we going ? " " A place you like to go to , " said Ben . " The carriage is out front , sir , " said Martha . " Give this to Mrs. Chapin when she wakes up . Come on , son . " The father and son drove away in the cut-under and Ben refused to vouchsafe any information until it was unmistakable that theywere driving to The Run . " Are we going to The Run ? " " Yes . " " What for ? " " A surprise . " " A picnic , Father ? " " You 'll see . " The Run was the name for a large reservoir owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boathouses , elaborate and simple . The Chapin boathouse was not one of the simple places . Ben got out and lowered the horse 's checkrein and knotted the tie-strap . " What are we going to do ? " said Joe . " We 're going for a swim . " " I ca n't swim , Father , you know that . " " Now 's the time to learn . " They entered the boathouse and went downstairs to the men 's dressing room . Ben took off his clothes and put on his bathing suit . " Well , get undressed , son . " " I do n't want to . I do n't want to learn to swim . "  | " Now , just take off your clothes and hang them up over there . " " I want to go home ! " " All in good season . Shall I undress you , or can you undress your-self ? " " I do n't want to get undressed . I do n't want to learn to swine ! I want Mummy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now do as I say , or I 'll do it for you . " The boy took off his clothes and laid them in a pile and stood waiting for the next move . " That 's a good boy . Now for a dip . " The water was eight feet deep in front of the Chapin boathouse . Into it Ben suddenly threw his son , then after a few seconds he loweredhimself into the water and took hold of the screaming , thrashing child . " See ? Now you can swim . " In half an hour the boy actually could swim . When Ben said it was time to go home the boy asked to go in once more and Ben granted the permission . They dried themselves and got into their street clothes . " See ? Now you can swim . Is n't that splendid ? Did you like it ? Do you like being able to swim ? " " Yes . Oh , yes . Wait till I tell Mummy I can swim . " " It 's the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry I had to take you by surprise , but that 's the only way . And you 'll never forget it . Once you learn to swim , you never forget . Is n't that splendid ? " They drove to the stable and went through the yard to the house together , the father with his hand on the boy 's shoulder . " I hope Mummy 's awake so I can tell her . " " She is . I see her at the window . " The boy looked up and waved and his mother waved back . " Come up and see me , dear , " she called to him . " I have a surprise for you , " said the boy . He and his father went to Charlotte 's room . " Tell me all about it , " said Charlotte . " I want to know everything you did . " The boy gave an accurate , excited account of the swimming lesson . When he finished his mother said , " Have you had any dinner ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , run downstairs now . Your father will be down in a minute or two . " The boy left the bedroom . When the door was closed they satp138until they heard his rapid footsteps on the stairs , then Charlotte got up and crossed the room and slapped Ben 's face three times , four times . " I could kill you , " she said . " I understand that , Charlotte . " " You are a pig , a coward , a beast . Do you realize what could have happened ? Hit his head on a stone ? Heart attack from that freezing water ? You are the worst son of a bitch that ever lived . Do you hear me ? You are the worst son of a bitch that ever lived . You are a son of a bitch , a son of a bitch . You are a fucking son of a bitch , do you hear me ? You son of a bitch . Oh , I 'd like to kill you . I 'd love to kill you so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " I know that , Charlotte . " " And you did it to torture me . " " No , " said lien . " I wanted to teach your boy to swim , and I did . " " You son of a hitch . " You ca n't swim , " said Ben . " Now you can go to The Run with him and he wo n't drown . Before this you could n't save him . Now he can swim . Now if you 'll excuse me . " He went downstairs and from the dining room the boy called to him . " Is that you , lather ? " " Yes , my dear . I have to go back to the office . Good-bye . " " Good-bye , Father , " said the boy . Charlotte should have been  --  but was not  --  grateful to Ben if for no other reason than that Ben 's drastic introduction to swimming put Joe on equal terms with Arthur McHenry . Arthur had learned to swim the same way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that Arthur could be better at anything than Joe was . She had plans for Arthur even at that age : Arthur was a nice boy , a quiet , steady boy , well born and healthy , and devoted to Joe . The friendshipbetween the boys was a natural and genuine thing and needed no more than propinquity for a start . But Charlotte gave it active and through encouragement . She wanted Joe to have a suitable friend ; a boy with the same background but an ancillary personality . She was not convinced that at the age of six Joe was a brilliant boy in the things of the mind , but she correctly judged her son to have the makingsof a Brilliant personality . He had good looks that were not likely to suffer during the distortions of puberty and adolescence . ( The fine thin nose , the beautifully formed thin lips . ) His way with servants was something yon were born with , almost never acquired , almost never lost . At a children 's party he was the child whom , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was accused of arro/gance and insolence before he was ten years old , and in most instancesthe accusations were unjustified . But the mothers of lumps of children felt keenly the difference between their own scions and the Chapin heir . Joe , the most mannerly child , was subject to the severestscrutiny because his slightest departure from the conventional politenesses was automatically exaggerated by the very fact of his usual good manners . At a party at the Montgomerys ' when Joe was ten an incident occurredthat affected various lives out of proportion to the words and deeds making up the incident . The game was Hide the Thimble . The thimble was hidden , and the children trooped into the parlor to search for it . Blanche Montgomery , the mother of the nominal host Jerry Montgomery , made the customary announcement : " When I say you 're getting warm , that means you 're getting close to it . When I say you 're getting cold , you 're getting farther away . Does everybody understand ? " Yes , they all understood . They milled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warmest ? " " The warmest ? Henry Laubach 's the warmest , " said Blanche . " No he is n't , " said Joe Chapin . " Oh , yes he is , Joe , " said Blanche Montgomery . " Oh , no he is n't , " said Joe . " Please do n't be rude , Joe . That 's naughty , " said Blanche . " But Henry is n't the warmest , " said Joe . " Then suppose you tell us who is , " said Blanche . " Arthur is , " said Joe . " I hardly think so . Arthur 's very cold . " " Ha ha ha . " Joe laughed . " Are you cold , Arthur ? " Arthur laughed . " No , I 'm boiling hot . " " Are you the boiling-hottest one in the room ? " said Joe . " Ooh , I 'm scalding hot , " said Arthur . " Just a moment , please , " said Blanche . She walked to the part of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has played a nasty trick , and I think we all know who it is , " said Blanche . Some of the children provided her answer : " Joe Chapin ! Joe Chapin ! " " Have you got the thimble ? " said Blanche . " No , " said Joe . " Or Arthur McHenry ? " " Yes , I have it , " said Arthur.  | " Then hand it over , please , and we 'll start the game again without you boys . No prize for either one of you . " " But I found it and I gave it to Arthur , " said Joe . " You played a deceitful trick on all the other children . You 're a spoil-sport , " said Blanche . " But I 'm not , Mrs. Montgomery . I saw it first , as soon as we came in the room , said loc.  --  That mist have been before the game started , " said Blanche . " No , it was n't . The game started as soon as we came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , volt thought wrong . " " ' That 's not fair . I found it first and I gave it to Arthur and he was the wannest. "  --  HIM is not the way the game is played , and you know it . And what 's more , I do n't like little boys to be impertinent . " " I was n't impertinent , " said Joe . " Yes you were . You always are . You think you 're a lot , but you 're not . " ' Then I 'm going home , " said Joe . " Me too , " said Arthur McHenry . " You 'll do no such thing . Kindly hand over the thimble and we 'll start the game over again without you two boys . " Al flint handed her the thimble . " Yon boys can sit here , and now , children , all the others go out in the hall and we 'll hide it again . All others go out in the hall , please . No , Joe . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not going out in the hall , we 're going home , " said Joe . " You 'll have to wait for your carriage , " said Blanche . Joe stared at her for a few seconds , then suddenly he ran , followed by Arthur , out of the house , without stopping for cap and coat . The woman hurried to the porch , calling after them , but her voice only made them quicken their speed . The Montgomery house was on Lantenengo Street , on the other side of town from the Chapins ' on Frederick Street . The boys stopped running at Main Street and spent a half hour looking in the shop windows and otherwise disporting themselves , picking up some mud on their shoes and stockings and incidentally catching the beginnings of colds in the late-winter air . When darkness began to come each boy went to his own home . Blanche Montgomery was with Joe 's mother in the sitting room . " Mummy ? " called Joe.  | " In the sitting room , dear . " " Do n't track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Martha . " Let me wipe them off . " " Martha 's taking the mud off my shoes , " called Joe . " Take off your shoes and come in here , " said Charlotte . The boy went to the sitting room . On seeing Blanche Montgomeryhe hesitated . " I want you to apologize to Mrs. Montgomery for leaving her house that way . " " I apologize , " said Joe , and turned to leave . " Is that all , Mrs. Montgomery ? " said Charlotte . " I 'm sorry this had to happen , and  --  " " We 're all sorry it happened . Thank you for coming over . Very considerate of you . Martha , will you see Mrs. Montgomery to the front door ? " Charlotte emphasized front door only slightly . Blanche spoke to Joe : " I 'm sorry this had to happen , Joe . Next year I hope we 'll  --  " " Yes . Thank you very much , " said Charlotte . Blanche Montgomery left the house and Joe gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's all ? You had n't been misbehaving before the game started ? " " No , Mummy . And besides , that was the first game . And we did n't even get any refreshments . " " You can hardly expect to get refreshments if you leave the party before it 's time . I 've told Martha to give you your supper in the kitchen . I 'm very disappointed in you . " " But why , Mummy ? She just as much as told us we were cheating and we were n't . I saw the thimble first . " " That 's not why I 'm disappointed in you . A gentleman does n't make scenes . You were a guest in their house and you 're supposed to abide by the rules of the house you 're visiting . I 've told Martha , no dessert . " " What is dessert ? " " Floating Island . " " But I love Floating Island ! " " I 'm sorry , but that 's your punishment , not only for forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . What if there 'd been a runaway and the horses dashed up on the sidewalk ? " " I would have run inside the stores . " " Never mind the ready answers , please . I 'm very disappointed inp142you , very , very disappointed . Now go have your supper and get ready for bed . " The Montgomerys of that day were on an equal footing , socially , with the Chapins and the Mcl:Ienrys , although Blanche Montgomery was not a Gibbsvillc girl . She was a Reading girl who had come to Gibbsvillc as a bride . She was , in fact , a distant connection of Charlotte 's , but Charlotte had not " done anything about her " when she came to Gibbsvillc , an oversight for which Charlotte was now glad . " ITavc you anything pending with the Montgomery firm ? " she asked Ben that evening . " How do you mean , pending ? " " Well , any business negotiations ? " " No , She gave him her own version of the party incident . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis with the Montgomeryfirm , do n't let that worry you . " " Worry me ? " " Are n't you planning some sort of reprisal , retribution ? " " Not exactly , not exactly . But I wanted to make sure . " " We 're more likely to be in opposition to the Montgomery firm than otherwise . They handle cases that we have to refuse because of Coal &; Iron association . How are you planning to put Blanche in her place ? " " You 're so clever , " said Charlotte . " Well , I have n't had time to consider . " " I would n't like to be Blanche Montgomery , " said Ben . " She deserves whatever she gets . She has it coming to her . Of mime it may take time . " " Whatever time it takes , Charlotte , she 'll know why you 're doing it said Ben . " Yes , but how much  --  simpler  --  if she does n't know I 'm doing it , whatever it is . Bess McHenry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's in our favor . She has n't much character , therefore Blanche wo n't look for trouble from that quarter . Let me see now , is Bess Miller related to the Montgomerys ? I do n't think so . " " No , no relation , " said Ben . " Before you go any further , askyourself if the Montgomerys know any of our weak points . " " I was n't aware that we had any weak points , " said Charlotte . " At least that would be worth anything to the Montgomerys . " " In that case , damn the torpedoes , go ahead ! " " I 'll need your help . You may hear of something they want to dop143and we can prevent their doing . I 'm glad I never called lot when she came to town . " " Yes , it would look hypocritical now , " said Ben , with a cum . pletely straight face . " You had n't thought of giving a large party and not inviting them ? " " Oh , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Blanche were to take a lover . . . " " Blanche ? In Gibbsville ? Nobody has lovers in Gibbsville , " said Charlotte . " Where would she meet him ? " " I 've often wondered . " " You have ? " said Charlotte . " Why , yes , and so have you , my dear , or you would n't have asked the question in the first place . " " Dear , dear , dear me . We 're so deucedly clever . I know where they could meet . In the summer house . There was a famous case and you know it better than I do . " " Yes , and ever since then no respectable woman in Gibbsville ever goes to her summer house without her husband . Summer house became practically a synonym for house of assignation . Well , this kind of talk does me no good . You decide on your own form of revenge , my dear , but do n't start the wheels going without consultingme . We may have skeletons in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simile . " " It 's a metaphor . I did n't think you 'd like it , but do bear in mind that there is one thing about you and me that would make a nice morsel of gossip . The protecting mother that is no wife to her hus-band . " " You may come to my room tonight , Ben . If your desires are that strong , that you 'd risk my life and unquestionably , unquestionably start a baby that is n't even a  --  that there 's no name for . You have a son , healthy and beautiful and to be proud of . But you never saw the others , and I did . However , you have rights to my body , I suppose . " " Oh , do n't talk about it , Charlotte . " " I never would , if I had my way . But I know this much , Ben . If you did come to my room , and I did have another of those  --  things , and that 's what they are  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , anything . " " You 're in no danger , Charlotte . " " I 'm never sure when you talk this way , " said Charlotte . " I think I 'll drop a note to Bess and ask her to have a cup of tea . Now you , Ben dear , why do n't you smoke a cigar ? It always rests you . "  | " Yes , I believe I will , and a glass of brandy . " " Whiskey , Ben . The brandy gives you those heart palpitations . " Bess Miller Mcllenry was a large blonde Pennsylvanian whose fixed attitude was that of a woman who was attentively listening to each word of every speaker , following the conversation from speaker to speaker as though she were a speechless moderator , a powerless but conscientious judge . In so doing she always kept her mouth slightly open as if tentatively half-forming the speaker 's words , but when she was included in the conversation she was invariably taken by surprise , and had nothing to contribute . She had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her vis-a-vis had declared anything . She wanted to give no trouble , to receive no trouble , and her life was dedicated to the comfort of Arthur Davis McI lenry , her husband ; to Arthur Miller McHenry , her son ; to Pansy Nlcl henry , her daughter ; to the house on South Main Street where she made her home ; to Trinity Church ; and to the canary birds which she talked to in terms and volume which she withheld from human beings . She belonged to the sisterhood that are commonly called good women . Bess McHenry knew that the summons to tea at Number ro Frederick Street was related to the incident at the Montgomery party . Her own inclination would have been to forget the whole matter . Her son Arthur had been punished for his participation by being deprivednot only of dessert but of supper , and the reason for his punishmentwas that he had committed a breach of etiquette in leaving the party before it was time , a somewhat different crime from the subtler one of not behaving according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were simpler in the McHenry household . Charlotte had assumed semi-invalid status among her friends and it was generally accepted that " Charlotte does n't go out . " A visit to Charlotte consequently was always opened with some remarks about her condition . It was for the most part an age of reticence and there was no need for specific anatomical report ; Charlotte had some femaletrouble and no matter how curious her friends might be , none of them took the initiative in finding out what the trouble was  --  and Charlotte most certainly never volunteered anything , " You 're looking well , Charlotte . " " Thank you , Bess . And so are you . That 's a perfect color to go with your eyes . " " Oh , this ? I bought the material in Philadelphia last October andp145I had Mrs. Hammer make it into a dress for me . I was going to get rid of Mrs. Hammer , but after she made this I decided to give her anotherchance . " " She needs the work so . " " She needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the work . What do you pay her , Charlotte ? " " Well , I have n't had her doing any sewing for me lately . " " Oh , she has n't done any sewing for you . " " Not lately , but I 've really had so little sewing that I have n't done myself . I like to sew . " " Yes , you 've always liked to sew , have n't you ? I wish I had more time for the nice sewing . I do the children 's mending and some of Arthur 's things , but that does n't give me much time for fancywork . " " Yes , I do some of Ben 's things too , and all of Joe 's . The darning is the only part that I do n't like . " " The darning , I do n't like that either . Is n't darning a nuisance ? I have a basketful at home that every time I look at it , it just seems to say to me , Bess , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Charlotte . " Boys ' stockings are the limit . " " But not really a chore , not for our boys . Arthur is such a delight . Ben and I often congratulate ourselves that Joe has such a fine boy for a friend . Best friend . " " Oh , dear . Joe is  --  I ca n't put it into words how much we love Joe . " " And so nice together . " " Are n't they ? They 're so nice together . " Charlotte sighed . " I wonder why a woman like Blanche Montgomery  --  nowhow can she call herself a lady ? " " Exactly . " " Our boys must have been to dozens of parties , dozens  --  " " At least , " said Bess , and then , as though she had counted : " Dozens . " And behaved like little gentlemen , always . You know , Bess , we 'll never get to the truth of what really happened at Blanche Montgomery 's house . I most assuredly did n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me that very day . " " Did she ? " " Before Joe got home , spattered with mud from the street , andp146the start of a heavy cold . Oh , yes . Blanche was here making accusationsagainst a ten-year-old boy , two ten-year-old boys . Arthur as well as Joe . Did Arthur catch a cold too ? " " A slight one , yes . " " That 's what I thought . Something happened that made those children want to leave that house without waiting to put on their hats and coats . It may have started over the game of Hide the Thimble , Bess , but there must have been more to it than that . There must have been . " " Oh , I think so too , Charlotte . " Charlotte smoothed her skirt and folded her hands . " What can we do about Blanche Montgomery ? " " I do n't know . IIad you thought of anything ? " " We do n't want people to think we 're two mothers resenting the shabby treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and making it impossible for them to stay another minute . Of course we can see to it that our children never set foot in that house again . That we can take for granted , naturally . But that is n't enough . Blanche herself is responsible , and she 's the one that ought to be taught a lesson . " " She might be kept out of the Assembly . " " Something like that , but not that exactly . The Montgomerys have belonged to the Assembly since it started . " " Yes , they have , that 's true . " " She 's in your sewing club , is n't she ? " " Yes . Last year . Too bad it is n't this year . " " And the Altar Guild . " " Oh , yes . Busy as a bee in that . " " I 'm afraid it is n't a question then of keeping her out of things she 'd like to push her way into . It would be more of a reflection on the hlemtgomerys than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's that , Charlotte ? " " Well , the organized things , like the sewing club and the Altar t : uild , we ca n't do anything about them . But there are other things that are n't organizations . There 's that group you 're getting together for next year , the little dinner club . " " Arthur 's chairman . " " So lien told me . Naturally in my condition we had to decline , but so far you have n't even got a name for it , have you ? " " No , we have n't even got a name for it so far . It 's just an informalp147little dinner club . Once a month , November , December , January , February , and March . " " Just the kind of thing Blanche Montgomery 's dying to get in . An upstart from Reading , and some nice people that have lived here I would n't enjoy sitting down to dinner with her . Well , I think that would do for a start . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an invitation . " " You have so much influence , Bess . If she 's quietly left out , wit1 out making any fuss , and if people do n't accept her invitations , then she may come to realize that you simply ca n't humiliate small childrenand get off scot-free . She sat in this very room and I 've never seen a woman with such a guilty conscience . And when I saw my little boy , spattered with mud , and chilled by the cold  --  well , Arthur must have been the same , and you must have felt the same as I did . " " Yes , " said Bess . " I wo n't say anything about the dinner club , not even to Ben . You take care of it in your own way , and perhaps Mistress Montgomerywill learn that she ca n't ride roughshod over the feelings of some mothers . And if you think of anything where I can be of help , you tell me , Bess . It was our boys that were treated so shabbily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . " " I promise you that , Charlotte . " " Ah , dear Bess , old friends are the best , are n't they ? " " Yes . Yes they are . " The exclusion of the Montgomerys from the informal little dinner club was not noticed until the unannounced twenty-couple limit had been reached and nominations closed . It was an informal club in that there was no clubhouse , it had no rooms , no place for a bulletin board , no stationery . Its name was The Second Thursdays , without the word club . When it was seen that the Montgomerys were not included ( and when it became known they had not been asked ) , their social indispensability was at an end . Charlotte 's strategy had included extra , direct snubs for Blanche Montgomery , but she need not have planned so carefully . The absence of the Montgomerys from The Second Thursdays lowered their standing in the eyes of nonmembersand members  --  and no one , or almost no one , ever knew what had happened . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they were just another old family with money . And even Blanche Montgomery did not suspect Charlotte , who was not a mem/ber of The Second Thursdays ; nor did she suspect Bess , a woman incapableof intrigue . In her tears and anger she blamed herself , but she never discovered the real reason for the snub . Perhaps she spent too much money on clothes ? Perhaps she had flirted with someone 's husband ? Possibly they did not like the color she had chosen for the repainting of the old Montgomery mansion ? She was fully aware of the enormity of her failure : not even being married to a Montgomerywas enough to carry her , but being married to her was enough to hurt a Montgomery . In 1930 , when her son was a lawyer for the big bootleggers and organized prostitution , dressed like a bootlegger and one of the prostitutes ' best patrons  --  she still blamed herself , and wished that her boy could have turned out like Joe Chapin . Charlotte observed in passing that Bess McHenry had done her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit the Montgomery affair to become an obsession . There were other things to think about . Charlotte encountered no difficulty in persuadingthe McHenrys that their boy belonged in a boarding school . Arthur Davis McHenry had gone to Gibbsville High School in the Class of 187o and to Dickinson College . A high school education was considered adequate ; college , any college , was a luxury . Charlotte'sway was made easy by young Arthur 's wanting to do the things that Joe did , and Arthur D. and Bess McHenry were as enthusiasticas their son about boarding school . But the McHenrys were a Dickinson family , and to convince them that their boy should go to Yale was not so simple . It was not a question of money . The difference between having a boy at Yale and sending him to Dickinson , Lafayette or Muhlenberg was not important financially . But there existed a strong feeling in Pennsylvania in favor of the good nearby colleges , and a slight prejudice against Yale as a New England institution and Princeton as too strongly Southern . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional institution . But it was in Philadelphia , and many families preferred to have their sons in smaller towns  --  Easton , Allentown , Carlisle . Most of the boys who were sent to Yale had some prePennsylvaniaNew England background , as was the case with the Chapin family . It was always understood that Joe Chapin would go to Yale , but to will young Arthur McHenry 's family over from Dickinsonwas a task that took Charlotte and Ben five years . The winning argument was based not on Yale 's superiority as a college , but on the advantages of friendships that would help the boy if , as they predicted , he should become an outstanding lawyer . They had a point.  |p149The  Coal &; Iron Company was owned in Philadelphia and New York , where Yale men were more numerous than in Gibbsville . Charlotte 's concern for young Arthur 's future was real , but involvedonly his future as a roommate for Joe . Since it was impossible for her to accompany her son to Yale , she could do the next best thing : she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fortunate for all parties that the boys were fond of each other . The senior McIlenrys created no difficulty about law school . They sent their son to the University of Pennsylvania with Joe , ignoring the fact that Dickinson had a first-rate law school . But by that time Arthurand Bess " had a son at Yale " and they were committed to the Big Four . It never occurred to anyone to ask young Arthur his school and college preferences , possibly because it never occurred to him to wonderwhat they were . His companionship with Joe Chapin was so much a part of his life that in making the big decisions he was nearly always guided by Joe 's preferences . It would not have been an Americanway of thinking to say so , but the fact was that Joe occupied a position like that of royalty , with Arthur 's relationship that of noble companion . But never in his own mind did Arthur occupy a servile or humble position . He was often a convenience for Joe , but he never regarded himself as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy when Joe enjoyed the company of Alec Weeks , Dave Harrison , or Paul Donaldson . On his looks , his manners , and the fact that he was financially stable , Joe was invited to parties and into the homes of Yale friends who did not feel compelledalso to invite Arthur McHenry . Joe could easily have become a New Yorker and been lost in the large and increasing body of New York Yale men . Arthur , on the other hand , was truly a Pennsylvanian-at-Yale and never anything else ; never sought jobs or the entree to jobs in New York . To Arthur during his four years at New Haven and later at Penn , the big social event of the year remained the Gibbsville Assembly ; the New York and Philadelphia parties were events at which he always felt like a guest ; in Gibbsvillehe was a member of the Assembly ( or would be when he reached the age of twenty-five ) . In his own way Arthur McHenry came close to matching the Yale career of Ben Chapin , with the notable exceptionthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organizations joined and friendships made . But Ben Chapin and ArthurMcHenry were New Haven-Yale men , not New York-Yale men . Dave Harrison and Alec Weeks , New Yorkers , would have welcomedp150Joe Chapin into their midst and he never had trouble picking up the relationship when he would reunite with them . Out of sincere politenessthey would inquire for " McHenry " because he was known to them to be Joe 's best friend , while Joe was one of their crowd who happened to live in a place called Gibbsville . But Joe Chapin followed Arthur back to Gibbsville . They had one discussion on the subject . " I sometimes think I 'd like to work in New York , " said Joe in their senior year . " You 'd do well there , " said Arthur . " Do you think I would , honestly ? " " I think so . " " Why ? " " Well , you like New York . You have a good time there . You like the people . " " Yes , but I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , I never would , " said Arthur . " I belong in Gibbsville . I do n't really like New York as much as you do . " " No , you never have , have you ? " " Once or twice a year , that 'll be enough New York for me . But I 'd never feel that I was a part of New York . Any more than Alec or Dave would ever feel he was a part of Gibbsville . But you could fit in in New York very easily . " " Maybe . But I guess I have the same feeling about Gibbsville that you have . It 's where I was born , et cetera . " " As I look at it , our families spent a lot of money to educate us , Yale , and The Hill . But they gave us something else besides . " " What 's that ? " " Well , all those years before we went away to school , we were learning all about the people and the geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches . You might say we took a course in Gibbsville . Why throw that out the window ? No , I 'd never work in New York , not permanently . I 'll go to work in Father 's firm , get married , maybe run for judge some day . " " What about our partnership ? " " Ca n't have a partnership if you 're going to be in New York . " " Oh , I was n't very serious about New York . " " Well , I do n't blame you for considering it . " " I ) avc and Alec have been broaching the subject , that 's the only reason I considered it . " " Well , do n't act hastily . We 're not even in law school yet . " " And I 'm not so sure I 'd like New York if I went to live there , "  |p151said  Joe . " I do n't like the idea of having to explain who von arc . I do n't know how many times this has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and they say how strange it is they never niet nse before , and then when I tell them I 'm from Pennsylvania they look at me . Pennsylvania ? As though it were part of the Indian territory . Or else they take for granted I 'm from New York and ca n't under stand  --  well , the same thing over again . Why are they just meet ing me for the first time ? New York 's supposed to be a big place , but among Dave 's and Alec 's friends it 's just a small town like Gibbsvillc . The only difference is , I 'm not part of it in New York , and in Gibbsville I am . " " You could be part of it in New York in no time . " " I 'm not sure I could . When they start talking about things they did when they were children , I have to keep quiet . They all knew each other . I think it would take years before I got to be part of New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York girl . " " Have you got over your case on Marie Harrison ? " " It was never a real case . I kissed her , but I 'm not the only one that kissed Marie . And she 'd have let me do more than kiss her . You may think it 's a rotten way to talk about a friend 's sister , but I found out . I heard a Princeton fellow saying how Marie was looking for a husband and did n't care who it was or how or what she had to do to get him . And when I stayed at the Harrisons ' in February ... " " You do n't have to tell me anything . " " I 've told you that much , I might as well tell you what happened . I was given the guest room , on the same floor as Dave 's mother and father . On the same floor , mind you . And I was asleep the second night I was there and I guess it must have been three o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , or not suddenly . I woke up gradually . I thought I was dreaming this , but she was in bed with me . In her nightgown and in bed with me and rubbing her hand over my stomach and finally when I got altogether awake she put her hand over my mouth and whispered to me . Sh-h-h , darling . ' I thought I was dreaming it , but I knew I could n't be . " " Then what ? " " Frenched me . " " God ! Really ? " " You know I would n't make this up . " " I know . " " The next day I could hardly face her , but it did n't affect her.  |p152You  would have thought nothing happened . That night we all went out together and I did n't know what to say to her , and half the time I still could n't believe it was true , what 'd happened the night before . But it was true , all right . " " Why ? Did she say anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home in the carriage she whispered to me , Do n't go to sleep . ' I guess I could n't have anyway , because by that time I was hoping she 'd come to my room again . And she did . That time she did n't have to wake me up . I was waiting for her , over an hour . Closer to two hours . ' Darling , are you asleep ? ' she said . I said no , and she got into bed , but this time without her nightgown and I admit it , I did n't have anything on either . She stayed till about five o'clock in the morning . " " Good Lord , that 's taking a chance . " " I know , and I wondered how I could face her mother and father , and Dave , one of my best friends . But it did n't worry her . She 's like two people , two different people . You think of her as a pretty girl and good company , but like somebody 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll bet if Dave knew anything about it he 'd kill her , and me too . And in a way I would n't blame him . " " But you did n't make the advances . She did . " " But I should have had more sense . " " But what could you do ? " " Well , whatever I could do , I did n't do it . She 's like two completelydifferent people . But she 's not two different people . I took for granted that she expected me to marry her and before I came back to New Haven I said to her , ' Marie , I have to finish law school before I can get married , ' and do you know what she said ? " " No . " " She said , ' Well , do n't let that stop you from visiting us again . ' Never expected me to marry her . It meant no more to her than holdinghands does to some girls . I was relieved , but then I changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you had . " " I wrote her letter after letter . I wrote her every day for a while , and got no answer . Then she wrote me . Oh , I might as well show it to you . " Joe went to his desk and unlocked a black metal strong box . " I Icrc it is . " " ' Dear Joe , ' she says . ' I am writing to you because if I am to believe your letters I have led you on . Such was not my intention , much as I value you as a friend . Our pleasant moments together were not intended to convey that impression , therefore I can onlyp153say to you that I shall always think of you as a charming friend of Dave 's and I shall always be glad to see you as a welcome visitor to our house . Please forgive me if I have accidently ' ( She spells it a , c , d , e , n , t , 1 , y. ) given you any other impression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who must be nameless for the time being , otherwise I would be glad to tell you his name . I wish you every good fortune and I remain , Your friend , Marie . ' " " What do you know about that ? " said Arthur . " Well , she must have been in love with the other fellow when she came to my room . " " And yet it 's hard to believe , " said Arthur . " The whole thing 's hard to believe , " said Joe . " I 'm glad I do n't know who the other fellow is . " " Would you care to know what I suspect ? " " What ? " " I suspect she 's in love with a married man , " said Arthur . " You do ? So did I. Why else be so secretive ? " " Exactly . " " Well , that 's why I do n't think I want to marry a New York girl . " " Why ? " said Arthur . " They 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , but she 's the only one I had any experience with , that kind of experience , and I would n't want to be disillusioned again . Your father and mother , and my father and mother  --  that 's what I think marriage ought to be . Marie 's only twenty or twentyone , and yet think of her . " " Yes . " " She 's old , Arthur . What 'll she be like when she 's thirty ? Not in looks , but experience . I 'm sure it 's a married man , and most likely there 'll be  --  she 'll be written up in the scandal sheets . And when that does happen I 'll be thankful I escaped when I did . " " Yes . " " The man that marries Marie  --  how would you like to be in his boots ? " " Not me , thank you . " " True . But think of what I just told you . I was almost that man . I thought she expected me to marry her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what it was , sheer luck . But do you know what the experience did to me ? This does n't apply to you , but I look at the fellows we know and I wonder how much they know about women . And I also wonder if it shows on me , my experience . " " Well , I knew there was something going on that you did n't wantp154to tell me about , but I do n't know whether it would have shown itself to the other fellows . " " I hope not . I have no use for a rounder . I could never trust one in business , professionally , any more than I could socially . And I would n't want anyone to consider me a rounder , although of course I 'm not one . But if my experience with Marie showed on my face , it would show a weakness in my character . My mother always said those weaknesses show up sooner or later . " " I believe that . " " Do you know that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ? The Harrisons ' . One of the fine old New York families , according to Mother . " " Well , they are . " " Rut it shows that you ca n't always go by outward appearances or what you think you know about people , " said Joe . " Arthur , do you still believe what we used to believe  --  about the husband ? You remember , the husband should be just as decent as he expects his wife to be ? " " You mean bride and groom ? " " Yes . " " Yes , I believe that . I expect to be when I get married . " It I 'm not any more . Do you think that 's something I ought to tell my wife when I get married ? " " Well  --  I would n't , if I were you . " " I was hoping you 'd say that . I do n't feel that I belong to Marie , and that 's what counts . If you did n't really belong to somebody else before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never belonged to another woman . " " With a mental reservation . " " Yes , a mental reservation . Oh , I 'll tell her a white lie for that matter . " " Unless another girl comes to your room some time . Then it might not be a white lie . " " I never thought of that . It never crossed my mind . I do n't think it 's liable to happen . " " Do you half wish it would , Joe ? " " Well  --  we do n't lie to each other , you and I. So I 'll tell you t h e truth . rut I f ! had the powers of the Almighty , and I could eradicate my experience with Marie  --  I would n't . I think if she came to my room again I could n't resist her . " " Then you did belong to her , did n't you ? " " Yes , I did , Arthur . I admit it . When I get married I am goingp155to have to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lied to myself , but I could n't lie to you . Is n't that odd ? " " You 're truthful . " " It 's best in the long run . " " No doubt about it , " said Arthur . The friends avoided Marie as a topic of conversation for almost two years . They were rooming together in a fraternity house at he University of Pennsylvania . Arthur came home one afternoon in t he late winter and found Joe sitting in the Morris chair , still wearing his ulster and overshoes . " What 's the matter , Joe ? Is there something wrong ? " " Yes . " " Your family ? Your mother and father ? " " No . Marie . Here 's what was waiting for me when I got home . It 's from Dave . " Arthur read the letter : Dear Joe : Knowing your fondness for Marie and hers for you I am faced with the sad duty to tell you that she died last Thursday evening from peritonitis following an abdominal operation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburbs and the funeral services , which were strictly private , took place on Saturday . We had no pallbearers and we did not inviteanyone but family to the funeral . In going through her effects I found a small stack of letters which I recognized to be in your handwriting . I confess that I read one of the letters , although only one after I realized that they were love letters . I am returning them to you since I do not feel that they are for other eyes . It may console you to learn that Marie still had your photograph in a locket which she carried in her purse until the day she went to the hospital . I wish I had known that you and Marie had once been in love with each other . If your romance had been encouraged to completion there might be a different and happier story to tell today . But no more for the present .. . Dave " The poor thing , " said Arthur . " Is she , or am I ? " " I said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Arthur . " It sounds as though she 'd been in love with you all the time . " " It sounds like more than that , too , " said Joe.  | " You 're thinking of the operation ? " " I 'm thinking of the operation in a private hospital in the suburbs , and strictly private funeral , and mystery , covering up . You must know what I 'm thinking . " " That she died of an abortion . " " Yes . That 's what poor Dave is trying to tell me . I 'm going over to New York on the next train . " " Shall I go with you ? " " Thanks , Arthur . But I 'll be back later this evening . I just want to talk to Dave . I 'll send him a telegram and he can meet me at the University Club . I do n't want to see the family if I can help it . Just Dave . " Joe returned from New York after midnight . From his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to talk . " " I do n't know , " said Joe . He was putting his things in the coat closet . " Will you throw me a cigarette ? " said Arthur . Joe did so and sat in the Morris chair . " Dave asked me not to repeat any of this . " " I understand , " said Arthur . " On a slight technicality  --  everything we guessed from the letter was true . " " Everything you guessed , " said Arthur . " And what you guessed , too , " said Joe . " You guessed that she was in love with me , remember ? " " Yes , I remember I did . " " Two nights before she died , or rather the night before she died , she mentioned my name when she was in a sort of delirium . When she came out of it they asked her if she wanted to see me , and she said no , no , she did n't want me to become involved in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Oh , Arthur , why could n't I have known ? Why was I so stupid about her ? She loved me ! She 's the only person who ever did love me ! And what did I think ? What did I say ? " " Whatever you said , you only said it to me . " " Yes . I 'm not so much ashamed of what I said to you as what I thought . I tell you everything , but that was evil of me , thinking she was no more than ... " " Listen , Joe , if we were all hanged for what we thought we 'd all be on the gallows . "  | " I have a very strange feeling . I feel as though I 'd been found guilty of something that happened so long ago that I 've almost forgotten the crime I committed . I feel as though I ought to feel guilty , but I do n't feel guilty . And yet I know that all my life I will feel guilty . The older I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But you 're not guilty of anything . " " I was n't responsible for the abortion , no . And yet I was . If I had been wiser , more knowing  --  what do I mean ?  --  more percept ivc ' What I want to say is , if I 'd seen that she loved me she would n't have had the affair that ended the way it did . " " She sent you on your way , remember that , Joe . " " That 's when I should have been  --  perceptive . I keep using that word . There must be a better one . Understanding . I do n't know . " " How would you like a highball ? " " I tried one . I could n't finish it , " said Joe . " Joe , you 're making yourself feel what you do n't feel , trying to . You 're trying to make yourself feel what you think you ought to feel . " " Do you consider me as insincere as all that ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as though you had a duty to feel badly , " said Arthur . " I do n't think I like that . I do n't think I like that at all , Arthur . " " But am I right ? " " No , I do n't think you 're right for one minute . " " Well  --  you misunderstand me . I 'm trying to prevent you from upsetting yourself needlessly . " " Needlessly ! A girl that loved me lies dead in New York City because I was n't perceptive enough to realize . Needlessly ! " " Well  --  go to bed and try to get some sleep . " " Damn little sleep I 'll get tonight , " said Joe . But he went to bed , and , as Arthur noted , sleep came quite soon . In the succeeding months Arthur also noted that he had been unfair to Joe 's capacity for feeling . On a fine day Joe would bring up Marie 's name apropos of nothing . They would be at a University baseball game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , " I ca n't believe Marie is dead , " or , " Marie would have enjoyed this day . " He displayed no lachrymose grief , but it was not like Joe to bring up sad subjects , and Death was not a subject he brought up at all . Marie was the first of their contemporaries to die and the phenomenon which Death is to the young was brought even closer to them by the lively intimacy Joe had shared with Marie . There was something else about Joe that Arthur noticed , observ/ing it so frequently that he could predict it : at college dances and the larger Philadelphia functions and on visits to the seashore  --  where the two young men might be likely to meet girls they had not met before  --  Joe avoided the girls who were pretty and bright and gay . He would perform the duty dances , and his good manners were maintained , but he managed never to be alone with girls who might bewere  --  romanticallyintentioned . He seemed to prefer the company of spiritless pretty girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie , but even those girls were alone with him for no longer than the measures of a waltz , and it would amuse Arthur to watch Joe , at the conclusion of a dance number , guiding his partner to the safety of a group . For an outsider Joe was well received in Philadelphia . If he had been a Philadelphian he would have been a prospective member of the City Troop and the State-in-Schuylkill , but he approved of his own ineligibility . " I 'd feel the same way about a Philadelphian that came to Gibbsville , " he told Arthur . " You do n't just walk in and join our Assembly or The Second Thursdays . If you could , things like that would n't mean as much as they do to us . " Whatever Joe secretly felt about the organizations , Arthur was sure of one thing : Joe was not going to marry into them . " I 'll probably marry some day , " he said to Arthur . " But it will be a Gibbsville girl , and it wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requesting the honor of approximatelyeight hundred persons ' presence at the Chapin-Stokes marriage ceremony . In several hundred cases the invitations were the next thing to an insult : if out of the stiff envelope did not fall a card for the reception , a Gibbsville citizen and her husband were being reminded that they were not yet of consequence in the town . It was a local custom that silverware and china were not expected of persons who had been invited to the church but not to the reception . Nevertheless the purchasers of silverware and china were more numerousthan the list of persons invited to the reception . A few women bought the items because they would not admit to their jewelers that they had not received the double invitation ; and a smaller number of women bought the items because they were sure there had been a mistake . Edith Stokes made no such mistakes . Her lists had been checked and rechecked long before the engagement announcement , so that when she took the list to Charlotte Chapin , the mother of the groom and the bride-to-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R " for reception remained marked with an " R " ; a few , but a very few , marked with a " C " for church-only , were remarkedwith an " R " because Charlotte felt that this husband or that husband was slightly more important in the business affairs of the town than Edith could be expected to know . " It will mean a lot to Joe later on , Edith dear . I 'd have done just what you did , but if you let down the bars just a little bit , just in one or two instances , f know it will be appreciated . And they 're worthwhile people , and iu one more generation there would n't be the slightest question about their being invited . So do n't you think we ought to be nice to them now ? " " It 's remarkable , Mother Chapin , how you 've kept up your in-terest . " " Well  --  you will , too , dear . Our dear old Gibbsville , we 're very fond of our dear old Gibbsville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " I wonder how Charlotte Chapin is taking the turn of events . " ) The engagementcame as no surprise to her and caused her no displeasure . She confidently believed that there was nothing about Edith Stokes that she did not know , and the very fact that Joe had selected Edith as his bride was reassurance to Charlotte that her son knew nothing about women . He would have some surprises and some excitement from this girl , surprises and excitement that an inexperienced boy would have with any girl . After a time the surprises would end and during some of the excitement they would create a grandchild . But no girl with a face as plain as Edith 's could inspire a love or even a passion that would cause a son to reject his mother . It would be a safe marriage for the son , and it would present no problems to the mother . " You are going to have this house eventually , " said Charlotte , during the engagement period . " So why not from the very beginning ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your childrentoo . " Edith had agreed so quickly that Charlotte was not compelled to make the concessions she was prepared to make if Edith had resisted . Instead of having a whole story to themselves , or a suite , the bride and groom were given a bedroom and their own bath and some extra closet space . It was a six o'clock wedding and the chimes of Trinity and the long striped canopy down the terrace and across the sidewalk had given notice to the uninvited that something was up  --  and there were few who were unaware of what was up . A wedding in Trinity was always a favorite free show for the poor , who arrived early and stoodp160against the inside of the canopy walls , defying the routine efforts of the two constables to chase them away . The carriages of the bride and her bridesmaids began to arrive at ten minutes before the hour and when Edith with her father passed through the double line of the poor and up the carpeted stone steps there were remarks suitable to to the occasion : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Lace . . . Satin .. . Is n't she ? . . . Ah . . . Bouquet . . Her father ... Ai n't she ? .. . Did you ever ? . . . Good luck . . . Lovely . . . Is n't she ? ... " Her father produced a cut-glass , silver-capped vessel shaped like a cornucopiaand offered it to Edith . " It 's smelling salts , dear . " " I know , but I do n't need them , " said Edith . " Well , I do , " he said . " Any of the girls need them ? " " No , of course not , Father , " said Edith . " Well , give me a kiss , Miss . The last one as a miss . " He kissed her and the march to the altar was begun . Joe was as pale as his tie , but his responses were audible in the good acoustics of Trinity , and when the now married pair turned their back to the altar and commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone off well , without the breaking of a bridesmaid 's garter , a fainting , a coughing spell , a flatulent report , an apopleptic stroke , a child 's vomiting , an upset candelabrum , a bass gaffe by the organist , a popping of an usher 's shirtfront , a case of hiccoughs , a dropped walking-stick in the aisle , a weeping spell , a Socialist 's protest . It was as nice a wedding as anyone could hope for , with none of the disturbances that sometimes occur as a result of nervousness , anger , or jubilance . The reception , on which foolish expense had been spared , was in the best of good taste , dispensing with such ostentatious features as out-of-town caterers , florists , and orchestra , and taking on some of the spirit of a large family party . The secret of the principal couple 's destination was well kept and when they departed in a closed carriage there was no vulgar attempt to follow them . They were driven ten miles down-country to the Laubach farm , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hired farmer 's family . In the late morning they were to be driven to the railroad station and the train to Philadelphia and White SulphurSprings ; meanwhile the Laubach country house , warm and comfortable , lit by kerosene lamps and candles , was theirs . It was a house with which the bride and groom were familiar and when the Laubach coachman deposited their overnight luggage in the hall Edith and Joe were completely alone . He kissed her . " My wife , my love , " he said.  | " My dearest one , " she said . " My husband . " " Is n't it nice of the Laubachs ? " " Sweet of them . I do n't know what we would have donc . " " It would have been awful to take the sleeper . " " Oh , I could n't have stood that , " said Edith . " Everything went so beautifully , do n't you think ? " said Joe . " I expect so , dear . " " I know , you must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tizzy . " " I hope I remembered everyone 's name . " " You did . You were positively splendid . Much better than I was . " " Well  --  it 's over , and we 'll have the rest of our lives to think about it . " " The happiest day of my life , " said Joe . " And of mine , " said Edith . " Shall I  --  go upstairs ? " " Do you feel like it ? We can sit and talk awhile , if you like . " " No , my dear . I want to start our life together . " " Yes . " " Shall I call you ? " " Yes . " " ' When I turn out the light , will you come in ? " " My dearest , " he said . " But you  --  I almost forgot . Dearest , what will you do ? " " Let 's go upstairs together and see . " They climbed the stairs and went to the room which they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turned down . " You can change in the next room , " said Edith . " And then when I see the light go out , I 'll come in ? " " Yes . I 'll try not to be long . " She took fifteen minutes while he got into his pajamas and heavy dressing gown . When he saw the light go out he tapped on the door and she said , " Come in . " He walked directly in the dark to the bed and removed his dressing gown and laid it on a chair . She was under the covers and they kissed and embraced . He put his knee between her legs and she made a sound like a moan . " Do you want me to stop ? " he said . " No ! " She said . He felt her breasts and she pulled up her nightgown . " Do it to me , do it to me , " she said . " Hurry . " She made it difficult for him to find her ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . " For God 's sake , " she said . " For God 's sake . " " I 'm trying , dearest . "  | " Do it then , " she said angrily . The moment he entered her she had her climax , with a loud cry . His own climax followed and immediately she wanted him again , but when she realized it was impossible she lay calmer , while he stroked the hair of her head and kissed her cheek . " I 've been waiting all my life , " she said . " Does n't something happen to you ? " " Not what you think . " " I thought it did . " " Not always . Am I the first for you ? " " Yes . " " I hoped so . I knew it . And you 'll never be anyone else 's , will you ? " " No . " " You wo n't have to be . Unless you think I 'm too much this way . Do you think I am ? Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I was cold because I 'm shy ? " " I would n't want you to be cold , heavens , " he said . " Oh , dear . . . " she said . " What ? " " It has happened . What you thought . Oh , dear . ' When it did n't hurt , I thought  --  but it has happened . Now you have to marry me. " 1 le laughed . " Am I altogether different than you thought I 'd be ? " " I do n't know what I thought . Except that I love you . " " I love you too , Joe , " she said . " We must love each other for the rest of our lives , " he said . He put his head between her breasts and before she fully realized it he was asleep . " Arc you asleep , Joe ? " He did not answer , his breathing was an answer . " I own you , " she said . " At last . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubted . He had let himself get completely possessed by her , and as different from the man she had always known as he could be , and expressing himself into her and with her as he surely had with no one else in the world . But what she owned now was not enough . It was incomplete and he was asleep and distant from her , and the fire they had lit had gone out . And then she began to understand that he was going to take a lot of owning and that she had been wrong in thinking that owning him was going to be so quick and simple a matter as she had hoped andp1663believed . She might own him as completely as anyone else had owned him , and more and more as the years would pass , but she was beginning to see that what she had wanted was a bigger possessingthan she knew could exist . She had been naive in her simple want : the ceremony of matrimony , the consummation of it with their bodies . Now , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own him was not to be so easily satisfied , or possibly ever satisfied . It was not Love ; Love might easily have very little to do with it ; but it was as strong a desire as Love or Hate and it was going to be her life , the owning of this man . He was going to have to be more than a part of her , more than a child she was carrying or had given birth to , more than a dear friend or an essential of life . It was going to be as though she had covered him with a sac and as though he depended on her for breath and nourishment . And it was going to take forever and it never , never could be achieved because if it ever ended the ending would mean incompleteness , and the kind of owning she wanted was continuing and permanent and infinite . Now as she lay there , enjoying the experience of her body , she was beginning to see that she could possess him through his body and the sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his skin ( and there would be many such pleasures ) . But time itself was going to be as much a part of what she wanted as the kisses and the touches . Now she was pleased that he had gone to sleep so quickly , although at first she had not been pleased . Sleep would renew his strength for the tactile , neural pleasures which she planned to enjoy . But easy sleep also meant to her that he was a simple man who could be as nearly owned as she wanted him to be . Yes , it was impossible to own him as she wanted to own him , but that was because infinity was impossible , and as long as she had life she would be owning him just short of completeness , and there would be no resistance from this simple , now sleeping man . At first this new discovery of the enormity of owning him had alarmed her ; but as she put her hand on his cheek and let it slide from his cheek to her breast she enjoyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would even teach him to want more than he knew , because all that he could ever want would be so little in comparison with what she would be taking . She thought of her friends and of marriages she had known , and the details of marriage : the giving of shelter and warmth and food and clothing , the creation and bearing and raising of children ; the problems of money and outside relationships ; the compatibility andp164the incompatibility ; the ordering of the meals and the choice of curtains ; the separations and quarrels and reuniting ; the effect of public opinion ; the small business of whom to invite and where to educate the young and the suitability of an Easter bonnet . And she smiled . They were all so easy , such insignificant problems when they were problems , and ambitions and hopes and short-lived desires . Now in herself she felt greatness , not mere superiority but greatness . It took greatness to want to own a human being and to come as close to achieving it as she would with Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one else could ever understand . She owned the idea itself , she accepted the inevitability of its incompleteness , and the knowledge of her greatness and that she had a life with a great plan were already starting her on a new and unique serenity . And suddenly she laughed at infidelity : what a foolish admission of inferiorityto want to squander time with more than one man when the owning of one man was going to be such a fascinating passion ! What did it matter if the owning were inevitably unachievable ? She had a life with a plan . There came a time when at last the Chapin-Stokes wedding was a part of the social history of Gibbsville . The town dearly loved to talk about its weddings and its funerals , its Assemblies , and its rare crimes involving members of the elect . Assemblies occurred twice a year and t hey provided conversational topics throughout the succeeding months ; funerals occurred when necessary , which was oftener than Assemblies ; j crimes involving the citizens of prominence occurred so infrequently t hat they were unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discussion of a Chapin-Stokes wedding ; the invitationlists were dwelt upon ; the conduct of the guests ; the women 's clothes and the men 's when there was some freakish departure from conventional attire ; the wedding presents ; the luck of the weather . The details of a wedding continued to be good conversational material untilit became known that the happy bride was expecting , and at precisclythat point the wedding took its place in the social history . It could always be revived , and would be revived so long as any guest survived to talk about it ; but as a conversational topic of the first rank it ceased to entertain when once the bride 's delicate condition was whispered to her cousins . In its way , a first pregnancy was a social event ; it provided social conversation . There would be speculation as to the sex of the unborn child ; there would be impromptu statistical researches based on the record of the bride 's family for producing sons , the groom 's familyp165record for producing daughters . It was a by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child had been determined early in the pregnancy . As the happy swelling became publicly noticcablc there were guesses as to how high the unborn infant lay , a vital point to those experienced mothers and observant virgins who held that the sex of the child could be predicted by its location in the belly of the mother . When more than two good friends were present there never could be a discussion of the act which caused the pregnancy , but it was the only stage which was not considered fit for conversation , so long as the conversation was conducted in discreetly euphemistic terms . Edith 's hip measurements came in for repeated discussion and the previous regularity and painlessness of her menstrual periods , and the size of her bust . The single , almost boisterously unuttered hope was that the child she carried would be a boy , or , if a girl , would look more like the father . A boy 's looks did n't matter ; but for a girl to look like Edith  --  it was phenomenal how no one seemed to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Frederick Street the possibility of a girl baby was acknowledged , but only because it was a God-fearing household . If God in His infinite wisdom was seeing fit to make this child a female , He must have some reason , and with the Deity one did not argue , one did not question . But the physical and mental preparations were carried on in a frame of mind that admitted the possibility as no more than a possibilityand an extremely unlikely happening . Ben Chapin sounded what he intended to be a humorous warning that girls were , after all , being born every day , but in the sitting room and backstairs his slight hedging was treated as though he had defied an established superstition . The expectant mother and the expectant grandmother were in a state of domestic felicity that was more than anything Edith had dreamed of and which proceeded from the moment Joe was permitted to announce the coming event . All her life Edith had had to make her own bed and tidy up her own room ; her mother had seen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her father had seen to it that she learn to rub down her own horse and hang the tack on the proper pegs . Now in her waiting months she was so much under the benevolence of Charlotte Chapin that Dr. English had to insist on her taking short walks to relieve her constipation . The fact that she had never ceased to hate the chores she had been compelled to do at home made Edith a willing subject of Charlotte 's benevolence . And the arrangement was satisfactory to the two women because they mutually understoodp166that it was impersonal , or at least as impersonal as it could be in view of the circumstance that one of them was actually carrying a child . Edith opposed no suggestion or rule or order that Charlotte set up . The rules were all made with Edith 's comfort a factor , which made them easy to honor ; and because she knew that her mother-in-law was thinking primarily of the grandchild , Edith did not wish for more warmth and less imperiousness in the stating of the rules . Charlotte was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was that she regarded the younger woman as an incubator . Charlotte was as far from being a Roman Catholic as a Christian woman could be , but she devoutly subscribed to the belief that in a choice betweenletting the mother or the infant survive the accouchement , the mother must die , the child must live . The pregnancy affected Charlotte'sattitude toward Joe in gradual and subtle ways that she did not li.erself immediately observe , but since Joe seemed not to notice the changes , Charlotte , when she became aware of them , was not frightenedof their possible effect on his love for her . If she had been caused to believe that there was a danger of diminished love for her , she would have rejected the baby and restored her son to first concern . But Joe too was behaving as though the child were the first ever to be conceived , and his attentiveness to his wife was a mixture of courtlinessand platonic love that all but denied the vigor essential to the creation of Edith 's condition . He came home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to her ( and to Charlotte ) until nine o'clock , and then he would stay one step behind her as they mounted the stairs . A second bed was placed in their room and he occupied it during the entire time of Edith 's known pregnancy becauseneither Joe nor Edith thought to ask the doctor 's advice in the matter . What they both quickly forgot was that neither of them had ordered the second bed ; it had appeared in their room without specific comment by Charlotte , and had been accepted by them as evidence of practical delicacy on her part . Someone in the household was always remembering that a baby was on the way , and the someone was not always Edith . Halfway towardher time the luxurious ease that Charlotte arranged for the young wife became monotonous ; Edith was not tempted to forsake the comfortsor to complain , for each little attention was welcome for the momentarypleasure it gave , but Edith was a strong young woman who was being overprotected from the simplest routines of living as well as from rainy weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ordinary household noises , and even the comparatively smallp167number of Gibbsville women who were her friends . Charlotte encouragedEdith to have visitors in pairs , never singly , on the theory that a single visitor would talk and talk without restraint , while party of three was somewhat less inclined to the intimacy of a panty of two and its long-winded long-lasting visit . Such visits , Charlotte said , were all right when they were not exhausting , although she never had asked Edith to define the limit of her exhaustion . A visit that lasted more than fifteen minutes was likely to be terminated by Charlotte 's entrance with the candid remark that " we " must rest . The visitors would put down Edith 's mild protests to conventional politeness  --  and go . As a consequence Edith saw little of anyone who was not a member of the Chapin family or its servants . The servants were among those who never let Edith forget that she was with child , Chapin child . In point of fact Edith was physically stronger than any of the female servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edith to lift anything or to ascend the stairs without being followed , a safeguardagainst a backward fall . Under this regimen Edith took on weight to such a degree that her figure could fairly be described as voluptuous . Watching her come in from the bathroom one evening Joe smiled and said : " Sweetheart , you are a lot of woman . " " I do n't know that that 's a very pleasing remark , " she said . " I meant it to be , " said Joe . " It does n't make any difference how you meant it . I do n't want to be fat . I hate being fat . " " I did n't say you were fat , dearest . " " You did n't have to say it . I know I am . What else have I got to do but notice how fat I 'm getting ? " " Dearest , I only meant that  --  your figure is very desirable . " She got into her bed and he went over to tuck her in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I ought to ? I do n't think I 'd better , " he said . For a while they limited themselves to gentle caresses , stroking of the hands , kissing of the cheek , but it could not last that way . He got out of the bed but she held his wrist tightly . " You ca n't stop now , " she said . " But we must n't , " he said . " You fool , you ca n't leave me this way . " She had never been so unrestrained , or so noisy in her demands . When they finished she lay there with her eyes closed and a grin of pleasure on her mouth . " Edith , darling , I 'm ashamed of myself , " he said.  |p168She  said nothing , appearing not to have heard him . " I promise never to do that again , " he said . She opened her eyes and smiled . " Stay here , " she said . " I ca n't . You know what 's liable to happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby . I might hurt you . Maybe I have . " " Nothing 's going to happen . I 'm all right , and so is the baby . " " I 'll have to talk to the doctor about it . " " You 'll do no such thing . Other women make love while they 're pregnant . " " Because their husbands are inconsiderate . " " Oh , what if they are ? Do you think the miners and people like that do n't have intercourse when the wife is pregnant ? And they have hundreds of babies . " " But we 're not miners and people like that . I 'm supposed to be a gentleman . I 'm ashamed of myself , and if anything happens it 's my fault . " " Well , nobody will know it 's your fault . " " I 'll know , " he said . " But nobody else will , so stop worrying about it . " " I 'll never stop till the baby is born and you 're all right , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're not so different from other people , and I 've been wanting this for months . And I 'll go on wanting it . Good heavens , nobody ever lets me forget that part of myself . Your mother , the servants , you . I think about myself all the time , and you . Everybody 's trying to make me think pretty and holy things  --  it 's quite the opposite , I assure you . " " It 's a very difficult time . " " You do n't know the first thing about it , so stop saying things you 've heard other people say . " " Good night , dearest , " he said . He kissed her forehead . " Good night , " she said . She heard him getting into bed and rustlingthe bedclothes , finding a comfortable sleeping position . She had no clock to tell her accurately , but she was sure he was sound asleep in less than 36o seconds . She heard the courthouse clock strike for hours . It was so for many nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated not by the Gregorian calendar but by one of her own devising based on lunar months and confusing even to herself . The clock meant no more : there was a grandfather 's clock on the secondfloorlanding , a grandmother 's clock in the sitting room , a banjo clock in Edith 's bedroom , a cuckoo clock in the kitchen , all kept woundp169and all signaling the time on the hour and the half-hour ; but Edith never knew what time it was , and cared not at all . She was drowsy a great deal of the time , at least partly because she had been broken of the habit of doing things . When her time , the infant 's time , was nearing , the months preceding seemed to have flown by , and every hour , then every minute , began to count . The first twinges of pain began in the early evening , but Dr. Englishhad been in to see Edith in the afternoon , and told her no more than she already knew . In an attempt to lighten her mood he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance that you 're going to have a baby . " " When ? " " Well , if you were one of my patients , a woman who lives out near the steel mill , I could tell you almost to the minute , and how long it would take . She 's had nine and another on the way . She does n't really need me . But with a first baby I do n't like to make very positive predictions . You know . I want to be your doctor with all your babies , so I do n't like to make a guess and be wrong on the first one . " " All my babies ? " " Yes . You may not think so now , Edith , but you and I are going to see a lot of each other , professionally . You 're going to want them . Oh , they can be all sorts of trouble , I know . Julian 's too high-spirited , for instance , but he 's not a bad boy and if we had our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't always have what we want in this life . Now I 'll leave you in the capable hands of Miss Mcllhenny and I probably will drop in first thing in the morning . " He was more nearly correct than he knew . He was sound asleep when he received the telephone call , and he was dressed , if unshaven , by the time Harry arrived at his house with the Chapin PierceArrow . " Doctoring must be hard work , sir . Three o'clock in the morning and I wager it happens often . " " It happens very often , Harry . " " Marian put the coffee on for you . " " Good . " There was no one asleep at io North Frederick , and for the first time in thirty years someone other than Charlotte Chapin was in command . She had no more true confidence in William English than she had in any other doctor or any other man , but doctors are accustomed to giving orders and are in the habit of being obeyed , two related facts which produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritarian men . ' I ' lie manner , even when it is only acquired , inspires respect and confidence , and with William English it was not only acquired but inborn . " Now if you do n't mind , I 'd like everybody to stay downstairs exceptMiss McHhenny and Marian , " said he , on the second-floor landing . " Marian ? " said Charlotte . " Yes , Marian . We 're not going to have time for Edith 's mother to see her first , but that 's just as well . Now , if you do n't mind , will everybodyclear out ? Downstairs , please ? " He had some coffee and a cigar in Ben Chapin 's bedroom and from time to time he would look in on Edith . Then Marian came in and said , " Nurse McIlhenny  --  " " Well , sooner than I expected . Thank you , Marian . I 'd like you to remain in the hall where we can call you if we need you . " He had another look at Edith , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of many times Nurse McIlhenny said , " Bear down , " and the birth had begun . After two hours they put the aluminum mask on her face and dropped chloroform on the gauze . With the outrageous final pain she fainted into deep sleep . " Tell Marian to tell them they have a daughter , " said Dr. English . " Granddaughter , I should say . " Marian tiptoed down the stairs to the sitting room . The father and the grandfather were fully dressed ; the grandmother was clad in flannel nightgown and a quilted dressing gown , bed socks and mules . Marian looked quickly at each person , and then from old habit she reported to Charlotte : " A baby girl , ma'am . A beautiful baby girl . " " Have you seen her ? " said Charlotte . " No , ma'am . " " How is my wife ? " said Joe Chapin . " Sleeping peacefully , Mr. Joe , sleeping peacefully . " " Really asleep , not  --  something else , " said Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby weigh ? " said Ben Chapin . " I was n't told , sir , " said Marian . " Exactly what were you told , Marian ? Without any of your own embellishments , please , " said Charlotte . " I was told to tell you that Mrs. Joseph Chapin had a fine baby girl  --  " " Who said that ? Who said fine ? " said Charlotte . " Miss McHhenny , Nurse McHhenny , " said Marian.  | " You have not spoken to Dr. English , " said Charlotte . " No , ma'am , but he was in the room when Nurse Mc Intently came out in the hall . " " And you were told to tell us  --  ? " said Charlotte . " That it was a beautiful , I mean fine baby girl , and Mrs. tahapin was sleeping peacefully , sir . Sleeping peacefully , Mr. Joe . " " Thank you , Marian , " said Joe . " That 's not all , " said Charlotte . " Marian , you march upstairs and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapin . " " Billy English will let us know , I 'm sure , " said Ben . " And again it may slip his mind , " said Charlotte . " Do as I say , Marian . " " Very good , ma'am , " said Marian , marching . " Congratulations , son , " said Ben , shaking Joe 's hand . " Now you belong to the great brotherhood of fathers . Welcome . " " My boy , " said Charlotte , kissing Joe , who bent down for the salute . " I 'm sure everything 's all right and you have nothing to worry about , although I should think William English might at least have told us himself . " " Shall we all have a glass of champagne ? " said Ben . " No , we shall not , " said Charlotte . " Five o'clock in the morning is no time to drink champagne . " " It 's no time to have a baby , either , " said Ben . " But you did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have anything to say about the champagne . " " Let 's not , Father , " said Joe . " Let 's wait . " " I have no misgivings about the baby or about Edith . If there 'd been any complications Billy English would have sent for you , not us , you . He did n't send for you , he sent Marian to tell all of us . I 'm going to have a glass of champagne and toast my granddaughter , and I 'm going to smash the glass in the fireplace . God damn it , I wo n't be around for her wedding , but I 'm here now . " He went out to the butler'spantry where there was a case of champagne in a bin . " Oh , hello , Harry , " said Ben , surprised . I-Iarry was sitting at the kitchen table . " It 's a baby girl . Is that tea , or whiskey you have in that cup ? " " I have to own up , it 's whiskey , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a bottle of champagne , Mrs. Chapin and Mr. Joe and I. Three of Mrs. Chapin 's best glasses and a bowl of ice . Bring them to the sitting room and I 'll open the bottle . "  | " May I offer congratulations , sir ? " " Thanks , Harry , you may , you may indeed . " " It 's too early to tell who she looks like ? " said Harry . " I have n't laid eyes on her . I 'm taking her on faith and I love her sight unseen . " " Yes , sir , " said Harry . He raised his cup . " To the new Miss Chapin . The only Miss Chapin , I guess , sir ? " " You are correct , " said Ben . Ben returned to the sitting room where Joe was sitting on the sofa beside his mother . " Well , any more news ? " said Ben . " Not yet , " said Joe . " Ca n't I persuade you two that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ben . " It 's easy for you to forget , " said Charlotte . " How dare you ! " said Ben . " Father , please , " said Joe . " Go upstairs and see your wife and your child , " said Ben . " Do as I tell you . " " I 'd better wait till  --  " " Did you hear me ? " said Ben . Joe rose and left the room , and when he had gone Ben stood before his wife . " So  --  you 've been filling him up with the horrors of it . " " I refuse to listen to you , " said Charlotte . " I know what you 're doing , and you know I know it , " said Ben . " If you could see yourself , " said Charlotte . " I see you , all right , " said Ben . " Yes , and I see you . You look as though you were having apoplexy . If you are  --  too bad . Too  --  bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , Charlotte . I 'm in the best of health and I 'm going to stay that way , so I can watch my son getting to be a man . " " Your idea of a man , " said Charlotte . " Exactly , " said Ben . " Now he 's a father , and you 're going to have to watch him getting to be a husband . He has n't been , but he will be . ' I'hc human being you ought to hate now is that baby . That baby is your rival now . " " Well , you never were , " said Charlotte . " I never had to worry about you . " " Oh , I admit that . You ran his life , you got the affection and respect . But watching you lose it to a tiny girl , an infant , that 's going to be some satisfaction to me . And there is n't a thing you can do about it , Charlotte my dear . "  | " We 'll see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself said , you wo n't be here for her wedding , and a lot can happen between now and then . " Harry came in with the tray . " Congratulations , ma'am . " " Thank you , Harry . " The man left the room and Ben picked up the champagne bottle , removed the foil and the wire and started to twist the cork . Suddenly he turned and fell onto the sofa , dropping the bottle . Charlotte jumped to her feet , away from him , and looked at him . His eyes had closed and he was breathing heavily , his cheeks puffing and vibrating his lips . " Ben ! " she whispered sharply . " Ben ! " There was no answer . " Ben Chapin , " she whispered again . That he was alive it was plain to see and hear . He was half sitting , half lying on the sofa , asleep as she had often seen him in his chair , but she knew that the suddenness of the overpowering sleep , the quick fall , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry responded . He went to Ben without speaking to Charlotte . " A stroke ? " said Harry . " You 'd better get Dr. English . " Dr. English came down to the sitting room in his shirt-sleeves . He examined Ben , and with Harry 's help stretched him out on the sofa . He turned to Charlotte . " He 's had a stroke . He must n't be moved . And I 'd like an ice pack . " " Some ice in the bowl , sir , " said Harry . " How convenient , " said English . " Did he just keel over ? " " Yes , " said Charlotte . " We were talking , and IIarry had brought in the champagne . And Ben was opening the bottle and suddenly he fell , right about where I was sitting . What can we do ? " " For the time being , let him sleep . I 'll give him some medicine . Harry , go upstairs and bring me my satchel , the small black one with the compartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop to answer any questions . Mrs. Chapin , I think it would be better if you went to your room . " Harry left . " I do n't think so , " said Charlotte . " Well , I do . " " I 'm perfectly all right , " said Charlotte . " Yes , I know you are , " said English . " That is n't what I was thinking about . And if you do n't like being alone , take Marian with you , but not your son . " " What are you implying ? "  | " Now , Mrs. Chapin , please ? " said English . " As soon as the registry'sopen I 'm going to get a trained nurse . You understand that there 'll be two trained nurses staying in the house ? " " Yes , I understand , " said Charlotte . " Then we both understand , " said English . " A mutual understanding , and no more need be said . " She half smiled at him . " I think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy English is , but this is Doctor English , Mrs. Chapin , and I think you 're being impertinent . " " You will excuse me ? " said Charlotte , and withdrew . The presence in io North Frederick of two helpless persons and two persons who were professionally helpful brought about major rearrangements in the housekeeping and in the household . " I always seem to be passing someone on the stairs , " said Joe to his wife . " Well , we have life and death happening right here at home . It 's like a small hospital . " " Does n't seem so small , either , " said Joe . " I went to see Billy Eng-lish . " " What did Billy have to say ? " " I went to have a talk with him about Father . " " Yes , I gathered that , " said Edith . " Billy does n't think that was the first stroke Father had . I do n't suppose Father ever said anything to you ? " " I-Ieavens , no . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father were getting closer , said Joe . " Mostly because I was having Ann . He was being solicitous , that 's ; ill . " " Ile never said anything to me . " " And I should n't think he 'd have said anything to your mother , " said Edith . " No . I have n't asked her , but I should n't think so , " said Joe . " If he had had a stroke before would n't somebody have known ? " " Not necessarily . It might have been a slight one and he didn'teven know it himself . At least not recognized it as a stroke . " " Arc you worried about him ? " " Ani I worried about him ? Perhaps not as much as I should be . " " Should you be ? " " Yes , I think so . " " Why ? " said Edith . " Something Billy English told you ? "  | " What he did n't tell me , as much as what he did . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well  --  he seemed to be implying that Father 'd now had two strokes and the next one would be fatal . " " But he did n't say it in so many words ? " " No , not in so many words . Doctors can be like lawyers when itcomes to making a positive statement . And I guess for the same reason . Self-protection . What you do n't say ca n't be used against you . " " It 's too bad your father is n't going to live a long time . " " It is , but why do you say it that way ? " said Joe . " Because he loves Ann and gets such pleasure out of her . " " So does Mother . " " Your mother is waiting for me to produce a son . Your father is happy that I produced Ann . " " Naturally Mother would like to have a grandson , but I do n't think of her as waiting for you to produce one . She loves you very dearly . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me , quite a few times . But I think your mother and I understand each other . You do n't understand us . You see  --  we do n't have to love each other , your mother and I. " " Not have to , of course . " " Not have to , and do n't . I am your wife , and that was all I was until Ann was born . Now it 's all I am again until I produce a grandson . You must n't insist on your mother and me loving each other . That 's one of your notions . You have so many notions . " " I believe in certain things , yes . " " Notions . I 'm talking about notions . You 've had a notion for years that your mother and father love each other . They do n't . They hate each other . Why ca n't you face the truth and admit that they hate each other ? I had n't lived in this house a week before I knew it . I guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I knew it . " " They often disagree , and  --  " " Please do n't deny it to me . That 's the trouble with your notions . You deceive yourself . " " Sometimes it 's better to deceive yourself . " " Oh , you do admit it . " " No , I do n't admit it . Underneath it all Father and Mother love each other . " " You 'd be happier if you admitted it , " said Edith . " Happier ? To admit that my father and mother hate each other ? " " Yes . "  | " Edith , there are times when I do n't understand you at all . " " I can readily believe that . " " How could I possibly be happier if I knew my father and mother hated each other ? " " I can explain that easily . If you admitted it , then you would n't keep on looking for signs of their loving each other . You never see any signs of it , but you go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth being , that they ca n't stand each other . " " Now how would that make me happier ? " " I 've just told you , " said Edith . " You spend half your life convincingyourself that they love each other and looking for proof , but the only time you get any kind of proof it 's proof that they do n't love each other , not that they do . " " But you have n't explained why I 'd be happier . " " If you thought there was a gold mine in the back yard and dug for it and dug for it , but then some expert told you there was no gold within a thousand miles , would n't you be happier not wasting your time ? " " The expert might be wrong . " " Meaning I might be wrong ? " said Edith . " Yes . You might be . " " When you were a little boy , you believed in Santa Claus . " " Till I was five years old , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " " Because believing in Santa Claus is a childish notion . " " It may be a childish notion , yes . But it 's a good one . " " For children . " " Yes . " " IDid the stork bring Ann ? " " Oh , now , Edith , " said Joe . " Did the stork bring Ann ? " " Answer yes or no ' ? No . " " You and I made love and your seed stayed inside me and grew and finally very painfully I gave birth to a child . Not the stork flying over Cibbsville and bringing a baby to io North Frederick Street . " " Yes . " " When you were born , did the stork bring you ? " " No . " " Your mother and father made love , and so forth . " " Yes . " 176 " Your mother eats three meals a day . " " Yes . " " Your father eats three meals a day . " " Yes . " " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so does my father . " " Do they drink water ? " " Yes . " " Do they breathe air ? " " Yes . " " Does your mother like anybody ? " " Of course . " " Does she dislike anybody ? " " Yes . " " Does she hate anybody ? " " Oh . " " Please just answer me . Does she ? " " I do n't know that she hates anybody . " " Do you believe it possible that she could hate anybody ? " " Could , that 's a big word . Yes , I suppose she could . " " Could she hate your father ? " " She could , but I do n't admit that she does . " " Will you admit that she could hate him and that he could hate her ? You do n't have to go into the reasons why they do , just admit that they could . If you admit that much , for the first time in your life , then that 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know of law cases in which the husband and wife hate each other , even kill each other . Your notion is that it could n't happen to your mother and your father . " " That 's what I prefer to think . " " You 're afraid that if you think something people will know you 're thinking it . Do n't be afraid of that . They wo n't have to know . But if you deceive yourself , you 'll know it . You 'll be more successful and happier if you do n't deceive yourself . I 'm happier than you are because I do n't deceive myself . I know all the good and the bad things about myself . " " I do n't think you 're any happier than I am , and I do n't know any of the bad things about you . " " You might not be so happy if you knew the bad things about me . " What are they ? "  | " They 're my secret , and I hope you never find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Would you like to know some of the bad things about me ? " said Joe . " No , I 'd rather not . " " Ah , then you practice self-deception too . " " Perhaps I do , perhaps not . But it does n't suit my plan to have you tell me the bad things about yourself . " " You 'd rather find them out on your own hook ? " " Oh , perhaps . I 'm only a woman , so do n't expect me to be con-sistent . " The crying of their daughter brought an end to the colloquy . The nursery was on the floor above their room and in the hall they saw Joe 's father standing in the doorway of his own bedroom , clad in nightgown and bathrobe and leaning on a snakewood walking stick . " Time for her little drink , eh ? " said Ben . " Time for her drink , yes , " said Edith . " Time for you to stay in your chair , Father , " said Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother my chair , " said Ben . " Come in , I want to talk with you.  | " I 'll be right down after I 've seen Ann , " said Joe . He followed Edith up the stairs and was allowed to hold the hungry baby while her mother prepared to nurse her . " I hope you do n't mind if I have notions about her , " said Joe . " What kind of notions ? " said Edith . " Childish ones , I guess . I want her to be the happiest girl that ever lived . " " So do I , " said Edith . She held up her hands for the baby . " I did n't finish , " said Joe , placing the baby in her mother 's hands . " I want her to be happy without thinking her mother and father hate each other . " " I do , too . Now would you mind leaving while I feed her ? " " I like to see you feeding her . " " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so go have your ? talk with your father . " Ben was lighting a cigar as Joe opened the door of his bedroom . 4 " lather , " said Joe . " I believe it does me more harm to sit here and wish I could have a cigar than smoking it does . Besides , what difference does it make ? Have one ? "  | " No , thanks , " said Joe . " Where I 'm going , there 'll be too much smoke to enjoy a cigar . " " Oh , now , Father . " " Too early in the day for you to have a drink , I suppose . There 's a bottle of whiskey on that closet shelf . Pour me a half a glass , will you please ? And fill it up with water . Half and half . Always reminds me of an old English story . A fellow 'd been out carousing late at night and he came to his favorite tavern , but it was closed . So he hanged on the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head out the window . I can just see him , with one of those nightcaps , putting his head out the upstairs window and saying , What do you want at this hour ? ' And the drunken gentleman said , ' I want inc half and half . " You 'll get your half and half , ' the innkeeper said , and poured the contents of the chamber pot down on his head . I-Ialf the old woman 's , and half mine , ' said the innkeeper . " " Here you are , " said Joe . " I first heard that story when I was a junior in college . I suppose they still tell it . " " Yes , they do . " " Old stories die hard , " said Ben . " Well , there are several things I want to talk about . First , I want you to find out how much it will cost to buy a full partnership in Arthur McHenry 's firm . I want you to find out right away , tomorrow , if possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check . " " I know the amount . It 's fifteen thousand dollars . " " Is that all ? " " That 's all , but I do n't want you to buy it for me , Father . I want to buy it myself and pay for it year by year . " " I know you do , and that pleases me , and I would have let you do that if I had n't had this stroke . But now I 'd like to see you a full partner before I die . It is n't much money , son . If you were going to open a grocery store on a good corner you 'd have to spend that much before you were through . And you 're not opening a grocery store . You 're becoming a partner in one of the best law firms in the eastern part of the state . With their name and our name , there wo n't be any better . " " Why do you want me to become a partner in another firm instead of continuing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you why . I have friends , but I also have enemies . The McHenrys have friends and enemies too . My enemies , that you may inherit , they may take their business to thep180firm with the understanding that Arthur handle the business . And the same is true the other way around . And two unrelated young fcl lows are stronger than any one fellow , especially carrying on a family business . There 's still another reason . A little healthy competition between you and Arthur will be good for both of you . Keep you on the alert , friendly rivalry , better all around . New blood for the McHenrys , new blood for the Chapins . Now I 'll tell you something else . " " Yes , " said Joe . " In about five years you 're going to be so successful , you and Arthur , that either one or both of you are going to be offered partnershipselsewhere . Philadelphia , and New York . Stay where you are . You will make more money here , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and the Philadelphia people , they 'll have to come to you . You wo n't be working for them as a junior partner , or any kind of partner . You will be able to fix the terms and conditionsyou want . You will be the one firm in this part of the world that the big fellows in New York and Philadelphia will want to do business with . " " Hmm . " " A lot of people are going to ask the same question you did . Why do you and Arthur form a partnership ? Well , it 's obvious that you can get along without Arthur , and Arthur can get along without you . So since that 's the case , people will say , well , those two young fellows must feel that they 're even stronger together than apart . Therefore why not do business with the two strong firms in one ? Later I 'll speak to the McHenrys as a courtesy and then we 'll make out the check . " " Father , I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , Joe . Be the man I wish I 'd been and did n't turn out to be . I do n't have to tell you not to do anything crooked , but I hope you can get through life without doing anything cruel , or dirty , or mean . Now then , I 've made a will . Your mother gets the bulk of what I have . The income while she lives . The bulk . I 've left you a hundred thousand dollars and I suggest you invest it and forget about it . Pretend you have n't got it . Earn your own money and live o  --  what you earn . I 've left twenty-five thousand outright to Edith . " " Excuse me , Father . You 're spilling your glass , " said Joe . As Ben was speaking he tilted the tumbler so that the whiskey and water dripped on the Brussels carpet . " Waste not , want not , " said Ben . " I do n't know why I said that . It does n't apply . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars . I 'd like top181remember Ann too , but of course you 'll have more children and it does n't seem fair to mention Ann and leave out the others that have n't been born . So you take care of them for me . I know you will . " " This talk , Father , this information you 're giving me . " " Yes ? " " I hope it does n't indicate pessimism on your part . You are n't in t hat frame of mind , I hope . A man who 's had a stroke does n't go out and play tennis , but he can live for years . " " He can , but this one is n't going to . Yes , I consider this one of our final talks , Joe , and since we 're about it , I have another request I hat I have n't made a condition in my will , but I can say to you , I hope you hold on to this house . Everything 's following the westward trend , Lantenengo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy propertyas far out Lantenengo as you can , hold on to that too , as long as you live . Do n't sell . But this house , do n't let it fall into other hands . I f you decide to sell , tear it down . I do n't want anyone but our family to live here . I hate to see that happen to a house . Our family built this house , and I would n't want another family to  --  to live in these rooms , go through our front door . I was born here , you were born here , and now my first grandchild . I hope you have grandchildrenborn in this house . I love this house . " " I 'll never sell it , or at least I hope I never have to , " said Joe . " If I had my way I 'd be cremated , so that what 's left of me could stay on in this house , but I guess that 's impossible in Gibbsville . I never heard of anybody being cremated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible . " " But cold-blooded , I think . I 'm not in favor of cremation . " " I do n't know , it seems much more sensible to me , " said Ben . " Joe , this is a very unpleasant ordeal I 'm putting you through , talking so morbidly , but I have a reason . I 'll tell you a secret . I do n't think this was the first stroke I had . I think it 's the second . I think I had one about two years ago . Not as bad as this one , but enough like this to make me feel pretty sure it was a stroke . Of course it may not have been a real stroke , but I was in Philadelphia , forget what the business was . And came back to the hotel late in the afternoon , got to my room , and fainted . Lay there till the chambermaid came to turn down my bed and she had the doctor . The hotel doctor . He asked me if I had a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did n't want to make any fuss , so I came home the next day . I never told your mother or anybody else , but I tell you now . It may have been a slight stroke . "  | " You mean it was a slight stroke . " " Well , it may have been . The hotel doctor did n't use that word . He may have been confused because I 'd had quite a bit to drink . Was n't intoxicated , but quite a few drinks . Well , what difference does it make now ? I 've had the real genuine article , diagnosed and so on . Oh , this is a hell of a life , Joe , and sometimes I sit here and wonder what makes us want to hang on to it . But then I think of little Ann , and I have my answer . I want to give you one last piece of advice about her . " " Please do , Father . " " Spoil her . " " You mean , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil her . Give her everything she ever asks for , everything you can . Edith wo n't let you , of course , but you give her as much as you can . First and foremost  --  love . When she wants a pony give her a pony . Dolls , dresses , toys . It never hurt a little girl to have her father spoil her . It never spoiled her , in fact . I once knew a girl , her father did the opposite of spoil her . And when she grew up she hated men , because her father did n't as-they-say spoil her . " " I do n't know that I can promise you that , Father . " " I did n't ask for your promise . I merely gave you a piece of advice . I 'll give you another piece of advice that you do n't have to pay any attention to . " " All right .

And reflected credit on your mother and me , and now you 're a father . Independent of your parents , and that 's a good thing . I have one regret , one big regret . " " What 's that , Father ? " " Well , it seems a pity that we had to wait all this time to have such a frank talk . But I suppose that 's not very consistent . One minute I tell von a father and son ca n't ever get close , the next minute ... " " I 've always felt very close to you , Father , " said Joe . his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe , I believe you have . "  |p183Joe  was so fully prepared for the death of his father that he was totally unprepared for the death of his mother . Ben Chapin staNcil : mound until the infant Ann was almost a year old . As is so often t he case , he had said his good-byes and had created in the minds of his household an acceptance of what was not yet an accomplished fact , hut a fact that was only awaiting the final , confirming incident . lien sit in his chair , smoked his cigar , drank his little whiskey , read his newspaper , fed himself his thrice-daily morsels , suitably greeted his family and servants , accepted their greetings in kind . Age and death %v ere upon him and his life was over , and it was as though his body knew it and was afraid . His body was not resisting death but giving in to it . The voice that communicated the industry of his mind was still hard and masculine but if the words had been fearful the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a manly voice , speakingno whimpering words , and making liars out of his eyes which only told what was happening to his body . The eyes had become weak , aid unrevealing of the soul of the man . They were sick eyes because they could not help it any more than his skin could help what was happening to it . One night he died . Harry Jackson was the first to notice that Charlotte was beginning to die . He saw her rather less frequently than did the other members of the household . He had a whipcord livery with black leather puttees , which he wore when he was acting as chauffeur , and it was his public dress . He had another uniform , black trousers and waistcoat and black alpaca jacket , which he wore when answering the doorbell . But most of his duties were in the stable-garage and in the yard and in the cellar . Harry was not a butler , or a chauffeur , or a coachman , or a valet . He was The Chapins ' Harry , who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peonies . Sometimes five-day , six-day stretches would pass in which he did n't lay eyes on Charlotte Chapin . In his own words , he stayed out of the way as much as possible , and his love for the big Pierce-Arrow kept him close to the stable , which lie had begun to call the garridge . An hour after the car had been returned to the garage a man could have run a white-gloved finger underthe fenders and found them spotless . All six cylinders were treated as individuals , and his principal reading was the Pierce-Arrow manual furnished by the Foss-Hughes firm in Philadelphia . The radiator petcockwas as ready for inspection as the lap robe , and frequently Harry would sit in the car happily when he could have been sittingp184comfortably in the kitchen with a spiked cup of tea . Sometimes when Charlotte sent for him he would send back word that he was all greasy when such was not the case . But he would wipe off real grease and change his shoes for any summons that gave him a chance to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early and staunch that Marian 's early attempts to explain it were futile . It soon seemed a sufficient explanation to say that Harry wanted a little girl of his own , and indeed it was the only explanation that anyone offered . No explanation ever became as important in the household as the fact itself . He simply loved the child . He had no fondness for her mother , and because they were so close in age , while distant in position , his feeling for Joe was neither deep nor warm . But when he began to realize that Joe 's feeling for the child was strong and true , Harry felt that on that score he could share a warm interest with Joe . If Joe said anything about Ann , Ilarry would smilingly watch the workings of Joe 's face and the pleasure in his eyes , and he would listen without interrupting to everything Joe had to say about his daughter . Harry was never heard to say , to declare , that he loved the child . It was so far from necessary that the declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be said against a child that was not yet a year old . But Harry was present when Charlotte made the mistake of blaming the child for her own weariness . It was shortly after Ben 's funeral . Charlotte 's visitor was Bess McHenry , who in all her niceness and stupidity had been telling Charlotte how well she had stood up through her ordeal . " I must n't let you believe that , Bess , " said Charlotte . " You must n't go on believing that . These past months , if I could have gotten away from an invalid husband and a screaming baby , I 'd have gone . " " Oh , no , Charlotte . Not you , " said Bess . Charlotte ignored her ; now she was talking to herself : " I do n't need much sleep , but I must have what I do need , and I do n't know when I 'll ever get it . I just do n't know . Do girl babies cry more than boys ? It seems that way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , less . You ca n't walk in this rain . How I envy you being able to go for a quiet stroll . I envy you . " 1 larry was one of the McHenrys ' friends ' servants who were always remembered with a $2.5o gold piece at Christmas , and he liked Bess MeHenry , but on the drive to her house he made sure she wasp185set straight on Ann Chapin . " I overheard you talking about the baby , " he said , pretending not to have heard everything . " Ali , that 's the bright spot at that house , that baby . The best in the land , an angel from heaven . A real comfort in every way . " " I imagine she must be , " said Bess McHenry . " A real princess , you might say , " said Harry . " If all babies were as good as her . . . Well , here we are , ma'am . " Ile returned to the house satisfied that he had corrected any wrong impression left by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a new impression of Charlotte herself . At least , he felt , he had planted a doubt in Mrs. McHenry 's mind . But Charlotte was not going to be let off so lightly . She had made her mistake and Harry never gave anyone a second chance . He became aggressively protective of the child against her grandmother . After Ben 's death the nursing staff was cut down to one member , Miss Mcllhenny . She was a trained nurse , not a baby nurse , and she was being paid one hundred dollars a month and room and board , but Joe decided it was worth the expense to keep her on ; she gave Edith a sense of security and Joe himself said he felt better about his mother with Miss Mcllhenny in the house . Her presence meant extra work for Marian ; she ate her dinner and supper off a tray , since her position in the household was , in Marian 's words , " too good to eat in the kitchen and not good enough to eat with The Family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did add slightly to Marian 's chores ; at the same time she took care of the baby work and she became a combination companion and personal maid to Mrs. Ben . And she had sense enough not to try to lord it over Marian and Harry , who could have made her life so miserable that she would not have stayed . She was obviously more at home having a cup of tea in the kitchen than watching Charlotte having her cup of tea in the sewing room . " It looks to me like it 'll only be a question of time before we get another visit from Wagner Brothers , " said Harry , one afternoon after Bess McHenry 's call . " The old lady ? " said Miss Mcllhenny . " There may be nothing the matter with her , nothing for the doctors to find , but if you want to know what I think ... " " What ? " " Well , her and the recently departed , I never heard them say a civil word to one another , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There you 're wrong . " " Am I ? All right , then . They never said anything excepting a civil word to one another . " " Now you 're right , " said Marian . " All politeness and none of the milk of human kindness . " " Exactly , " said Harry . " Exactly , Marian . They hated one another ! By Jesus  --  " " Not the name of the Lord , please , Harry , " said Miss Mcllhenny . " Excuse me . " " I do n't mind a little cursing and swearing , but not J. C. , " said Miss Mcllhenny . " But go on with what you were saying . I find it interesting . " " Well , what kept her alive , the old lady , was she hated him so much that it give her something to occupy her mind . Now she do n't have nobody to hate and I swear to you , I notice it taking effect on her . The daughter-in-law , she never mustered up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too anxious to please , she wants to have everything right . As long as it do n't cost her too much effort . She 's a lazy one , is n't she , Marian ? " " Not lazy , exactly . I never said she was lazy , " said Marian . " She 'll do what she has to do , but she 'll never go out of her way . You know how some of them are ? " " Oh , do I indeed ! " said Miss Mcllhenny . " They 'll make their own bed , but they wo n't put on fresh sheets for fear they 'll have to reach up on the top shelf of the closet . I could give you dozens of examples , but I know what you mean . But Harry , I do n't understand why you think we 'll be getting another visit from Wagner Brothers . She 's only a young woman compared to her husband . Still , I guess that puts her in her late sixties . " " ' The poison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The poison she cooks up inside herself , now she do n't get the opportunity to rid her physique of it , it runs through her system till her whole system is saturated with it like she was a sponge in a bottle of iodine . You two , you sec her more oftener than I do , so you do n't have my advantage of noticing how she 's changed since the old man passed away . I took notice the other day when I was in the sewing room . This old lady , I said to myself , she do n't have long . " " Well , she do n't complain of anything , " said Miss Mcllhenny . " So I ca n't call the doctor . " " I f I was you I 'd tell you one thing I 'd do , " said Harry . " What ? "  | " Do n't let her handle the baby . In her present weakened eondi tion she 's liable to drop little Ann  --  " " Oh , now , " said Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry . " And if that happened  --  " " If that happened , " said Marian . " Harry 'd strangle you with his own two hands . Maybe you would n't have anything to fear from the baby 's father , but Mr. Harry here  --  oh , my . " " You shut up , " said Harry . " I was talking to Miss Mac , not you . " " Be careful who you 're telling to shut up . I 'll have none of your impoliteness to me , " said Marian . " Now , the two of you , " said Miss McIlhenny . Harry 's warning , where it concerned the baby , took effect , although it was no cruel or unusual punishment for Charlotte to be deprived of the hefting of her granddaughter . Insofar as the warning was a prediction of Charlotte 's early end , it had little effect . Miss McIlhenny was not receiving any medical information from **25;8766;TOOLONG , for she was in fact frequently skeptical of the diagnoses of the qualified . Consequently Harry was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-told-you-so when Miss Mac one morning came out of Charlotte 's bedroom with the news that Charlotte was dead . It could have been said of her , in the words of one poet , that she died of nothing but a rage to live ; her passing was otherwise described in the Gibbsville press : she passed away peacefully in her sleep . By the very nature of things the lives of young married couples are likely to become complicated and simplified by the death of a couple 's four parents , as well as by the birth of their own children . In less than two years Joe Chapin 's parents and Edith 's father died , leaving Edith 's mother as the sole grandparent of Ann Chapin . The death of Edith 's father had remarkably little effect on Edith 's life . It made her no richer ; Carter Stokes , Sr. , left all his money to his wife . Emotionally , it caused no void . As to responsibility , Edith turned that over to her brother Carter , who was the kind of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of a widowed mother . Mrs. Stokes was an old bore , a bore before she was old and a worse bore as she aged . It is possible to take a second , more penetrating look at people who have the reputation for villainy and evil , and sometimes the second look makes for a reappraisal of the naughty ones . But the public judgment on bores is seldom to bep188appealed . In the first decade of the Twentieth Century the word " bore " was still a Society word , borrowed from the English and not in general conversational use in the United States of America . For that reason Mrs. Stokes was not often called a bore , but her qualificationsto the dubious distinction were known to her friends and acquaintances . She was never quite well , she was never quite ill . She was without distinction in appearance , without prettiness even in young womanhood , with a bosom that was almost flat but not firmly flat , with ankles that were not noticeably heavy or trim , and no one ever remembered or argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cleanliness but at the Assemblies she exuded the odor of perspiration without having to waltz . This woman had had some participation in the act of copulation and had given birth to two children ; had cooked edible meals , knitted shawls , gone to church , discharged servants , attended the opera , read the newspapers , cashed checks , purchased hats , skinned her kneecap , stayed at the Bellevue-Stratford , written letters , trimmed her toenails and lit a fire . And yet she was a bore . No experience and no total of experiences had excited her or made her the least bit exciting . She was a denial of the meaning to men of the word " woman . " The tone of her voice was ladylike and her enunciation was correct , but in all her life she never had said anything memorable or memorably . When Edith got away from her , she stayed away from her , and Mrs. Stokes even caused a strain on Joe 's unfailing politeness . What her father 's death did do was to fix Edith firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte Chapin dead , and her own mother waiting out her time in the South Main Street house and looked after by Carter , Edith became the lady of the house at ro North Frederick . Now she no longer had any sense of impermanency ; there was no old woman upstairs who could give and rescind the orders ; when Edith gave her address as io North Frederick Street , in the shops of Philadelphia and New York , she gave it with conviction , assurance , where in earlier months she often was afraid that the salesgirl doubted her right to say that that was where she lived . To Edith the house was a symbol of her improved station in life , and for that reason she was more than content to leave it as it had been . It pleased Joe that she did so , but that was no more than a happy accident . It never occurred to her to repaint , to redecorate , to refurnish . The house and its contents intact were the symbol , and any big change would have altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the moment whenp189she could begin to replace the lighting fixtures and the stair runnels and the purely decorative objects . Not so Edith . The only changes the made were in the den , and they were changes to gladden Joe 's heart : his school and college pictures , his diplomas , his fraternity andclnhshields , his other youthful souvenirs were brought down from the bedroom and given space in the little room . The transfer was , of course , a subtle announcement of the new fact that it was Edith 's husband who was now head of the house , but hardly anyone thought of it that way , and even if anyone had , was it not the truth ? Joe , with the death of his parents , was a rich man , much better fixed than many Gibbsville men who had retired , and for a time Edith considered Joe 's retirement as a possibility . The world beyond the borough limits of Gibbsville was not too well known to Joe , and known barely at all to Edith . On Joe 's income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange things , the lands and people that they knew through Stoddard 's Lectures . But who in Shanghai , China , would know that in Gibbsville , Pennsylvania , U. S. A. , Joseph B. Chapin was an aristocrat of unassailable standing ? If a Chinese prince were to come to Gibbsville , he would be entertained by the Chapins , but if the Chapins were visiting in Pekin , would the reverse be true ? Closer to home , to take up residence in Philadelphia or New York was not a prospect that attracted Edith . It would require much , much greater wealth than Joe possessed to get established in the big American cities . Joe could , of course , continue his legal career , but that was not to live as a retired gentleman . He could work anywhere . Thus Edith came around to the basic question of retirement itself . She knew precious little about the law , and not much more than that about Joe 's ability as a lawyer . But she did know that he was a member of a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business that would come its way through connections . From her brother Carter , who was no fool , she learned that a great deal of the work performed by a firm like McHenry &; Chapin was simply a matter of looking it up in a book . Arthur McHenry and Joe Chapin were not likely to save a man from the hangman 's noose through a dramatic courtroom strategy ; that kind of performance was in the Montgomery tradition , which was being maintained by Jerry Montgomery . The very fact that the brilliance , the fireworks were not a McHenry &; Chapin specialty was an invitation to the less spectacular but continuingly profitable kind of law business . Until her conversation with her brother , Edith had had the conventional idea of ap190corporation , the cartoonists ' fat man in the silk hat and with the dollar sign in his ascot necktie . Carter pointed out to her that the small meat-packing firm of Schneider &; Zimmermann , the local planingmills , the brass foundry , and most of the Main Street stores were , technically , corporations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape . McHenry &; Chapin not only attracted that kind of business : they were in a position to accept or reject clients . For the first time Edith understood that law was not all lawsuits , that the Mcl lenry &; Chapin kind of firm preferred to stay out of courtrooms . Moreover , by keeping out of courtrooms , McHenry &; Chapin acquired a kind of prestige that they carried into a courtroom when circumstances forced them into one . They almost never took a criminal case ; if for one reason or another they became counsel for the defense , they automatically conferred on the client a sanitary seal that put the plaintiff at an immediate disadvantage . The law firm , then , gave Joe something to do , and he seemed to like it . If he had had an interest in book collecting , or polo , or even if he had been the kind of young man who could go to his club cvcry day and while away the time in card playing and modulated chinking , Joe would have had Edith 's encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which did not interfere with his functioning as an owner of timber lands and a vestryman in Trinity . But her father was not a handsome man , and Joe was handsome ; her father was not a rich man , and Joe was rich . And her father was not her husband . She did not own her father . She had never been able to direct her father by order or by guidance , subtle or overt . She did not consider herself lucky to have Stokes as a father ; she never had had ambitions for him ; he never had been an instrument of her pleasure . And she was quite sure , without being bitter , that her father had not loved her ; as sure as that she never had loved him . Edith did love Joe , as an adjunct , as a part of herself and a mechanism in her life . That Joe loved her she never for two seconds doubted . In her alone , she was sure , reposed the power to awaken and continually reawaken whatever of lust there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been present with Joe every minute of his life from birth , and when the time came  --  on the night of their wedding  --  he was at last ready , and she was , as always , there to share this new experience . Before their marriage she had so finally convincedherself of Joe 's virginity , and on their wedding night she had been so much more convinced by his awkwardness  --  that she suffered no curiosity about his relations with other girls . Accordingly , shep191never inquired ; consequently , the lie he might have told her did not come up for a test . Her appraisal of his love for her , in those early years of their marriage , was no more complicated than such a simple emotion and such simple circumstances demanded . There was , for instance ( she believed ) , the fact that he told her he loved her . Then if that had not been enough , the fact that he depended on her completely for sexual pleasure . They were living in a time when it was popularly remarked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did look at other women , handsomer women  --  but never strayed from her . There was a point in politeness beyond which Joe did not go , and that was mild flirtatiousness . If , indeed , he ever reached that point . He was a gentleman , and the art of the fan was being practiced by the women they knew , which meant that some of the women appeared to be flirtatious ; but Joe would participate only to the extent that nonparticipationwould have been loutish . Aside from such politenesses , Joe gave Edith not the slightest reason to have the minutest doubt of his love for her . In a town that was populated  --  at least in their set  --  by happy couples and only happy couples , they stood out as a happy couple for other happy couples to use as a model . There was some slight uneasinessamong the other happy couples that was caused by the Chapins ' failure , deliberate or otherwise , to produce a second child . But the worries were set at rest when , along about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edith was going to have another baby . The British and German propaganda machines went quickly to work , although the British efforts were not as a rule characterized or even recognized as propaganda . In Gibbsville , where propaganda was not needed , the old German families responded as any such group might be expected to respond . The nice people , exclusive of the German-descended , and regardless of origin , immediately went to the assistance of the Allies . The German-descended were put on the defensive and some of them said and did foolish things when provoked that provoked reprisals , and in several cases enmities originatedthat not only outlasted the first World War , but were easily recalled upon the outbreak of World War II . Edith 's pregnancy and the European hostilities postponed any further discussion of travel abroad  --  postponed it for more than ten years . The war in Europe did a curious thing : it provided a topic of conversation ( except when the German-descended were present ) which was dotted with Europeanp192place names such as Louvain and Metz and the Argonne woodland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places they never had talked about in their lives ( Metz had occasionally been in their conversationsbecause there was a motorcar by that name ) ; but the conversationswere only " for show " ; the European war was not understood and the reporting of it was meager , so that the question , " Can we stay out of it ? , " was not being asked during the months that saw so much death in Europe while Edith was transfusing life to her child . Two , then three , then more of Joe 's Yale friends or acquaintanceswere reported to have joined the British and the French , but in conversations with Arthur Mct-Icnry the war remained a European affair , not brought any closer to home by the volunteering of their friends . One of the volunteers had earlier gone on big-game-hunting expeditions in Africa , and to Joe and Arthur his signing on with the British was precisely of a piece with his firing rifles at lions . It was a chance for adventure and no more . When another classmate was killed in the first battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big-game hunter or a mere adventurer ; but an explanation for his being with the British was not hard to find ; he was working for the London branch of an American bank and probably had a great many English friends . In every way the war was such a distant thing that Joe and Edith could hope for a son without any thought of his ever becoming cannon fodder . It happened that Ann was sitting on her father 's lap , being read to , when Miss McIlhenny , who had been re-engaged for the occasion , came to the den with the news that Edith had given birth to a son . " Did you hear that , dear ? Mummy  --  you have a brand-new baby brother , " said Joe . " What 's his name ? " said Ann . " Well , I think his name will be Joseph Benjamin Chapin , the same as mine , except that he 'll be Junior . Are n't you happy ? Are n't you pleased ? " " Everything 's fine , Mr. Chapin . Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss McIlhenny , thank you ever so much , " said Joe . " Why did you say everything is fine ? Do you mean there 's something wrong ? " said Ann . " Not a bit of it , " said Joe . " Can I see him ? " said Ann . " In a few minutes , " said Miss McIlhenny . " Why does Mummy have to get sick to have a baby brother ? " " It is n't really a sickness like  --  measles . "  | " She had to go to bed , she had Dr. English . 1 ) r . English is still upstairs , " said the child . " It 's because babies have to stay in bed so much when they 're tiny , and she wanted to be there when Dr. English brought him , " said the nurse . " How did Dr. English bring him ? " " In that little black bag , " said Miss Mcllhenny . " Why did n't he stuffocate , if he was in the little black bag ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , he is , very tiny , " said Joe . " Not so very tiny , at that , " said the nurse . " He 's over seven pounds . " " What if I do n't like him ? " said Ann . " Oh , you 'll love him , " said Joe . " I have n't even seen him , I 'm not sure I 'll love him . " " But you will love him , I 'm sure of that , " said Joe . " Just as we all loved you when you were born . " " Where is he going to sleep ? " " Why , I suppose in Mummy 's room , for the time being . In his crib . " " My crib , " said Ann . " Well , it was your crib when you were a tiny baby , but you do n't mind if he sleeps in it now , do you ? " " Yes I do , " said the child . " Somebody took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . That was n't nice . " " But they did it for a real , live baby , your new baby brother , " said Joe . " I know you 'd rather have your baby brother sleep in the crib than your dolly . " " No I would n't , " said the child . " What if somebody puts him in my bed ? " " Nobody 's going to put him in your bed , " said Joe . " You have your own bed as long as you want it . Then some day you 'll grow so big that we 'll have to buy you a bigger bed . " " What color ? " " Any color you like . " " Without a fence ? I want one without a fence . " " Oh , by that time you surely can have one without a fence . " " But then you 'll give my brother my bed . " " Well , maybe . Maybe not . " " Buy me a new bed and he can have mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , we 'll see . " " Father ? Will you carry me upstairs to see my brother ? " " Carry you ? My big girl ? " " I 'm not a big girl , I 'm a little girl . " " Tell you what I 'll do . I 'll go up first and have a moment or two with Mummy , then I 'll come down and carry my big little girl upstairs to see her brand-new brother . Does that sound like fun ? " " Yes , Father . " " Splendid . Now you go find Margaret and you and she can wait here for me . " " Margaret 's in the kitchen with Marian . " " Very well , you go tell her what I told you . " " Will you please tell her ? She wo n't obey me . " " All right . We 'll both tell her . " " Father ? " " Yes , dear . " " Will you pick me up and give me a hug and a kiss first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Joe . " You bet I will . " " And will you carry me out to the kitchen , please ? " " Sure I will that , " said Joe . " You sound like Marian , " said the child . " Sure and do I sound like Marian ? " " Father , you 're funny . " " Sure and am I funny ? " " Sure and you are , " said the child . " Am I funny ? " " Sure and you are , and the sweetest , loveliest  --  you 're my big little girl . Up we go ! " He picked her up and they started for the kitchen . " Do Marian some more , " she said . " Sure and I better stop if I know what 's good for me , " said Joe . " Do her some more , " said Ann . " Oh , that 's enough for the time being . " " Will you be right down ? " " Two shakes of a ram 's tail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother ? " " Well , I do n't know . It may be your bedtime . But we 'll see . " " When you say we 'll see ' you do it . When Mummy says it , shedoes n't . " " Hmm . We 'll discuss that some other time . All right , my dear , disniollnt . " " Please carry me into the kitchen . " " All right , into the kitchen but then I must go upstairs and see the rest of our family . "  |p195Later  that evening , and after the well-intentioned Mrs. Stokeshad departed for her own home ( after telling Ann that the stork hadbrought her brother and carried him down the chimney ) , Joe had a visit from Arthur McHenry . " I 'm glad you do n't like champagne any more than I do , " said Joe " It all tastes like Rubifoam to me , " said Arthur . " Rubifoam ? " " It 's a liquid I use to brush my teeth , " said Arthur . " Never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I never heard of . " " Well , welcome to the new arrival . " " Welcome to the new arrival , " repeated Joe . They drank their whiskey neat , and without another word or a signal they hurled the glasses into the fireplace . Next they toasted Edith . " I do n't think we have to be so destructivethis time , " said Joe . " It seems to me I remember paying a damn big bill for that dinner I gave my ushers . " " How is Edith ? " " Well , somewhat exhausted , naturally , but Billy English says she 's fine . How is Mildred ? " " I 'm discouraged , " said Arthur . " I 'm going to take her to Philadelphianext week to see a specialist . Do you know what she weighs ? A hundred and five . " " Goodness , Arthur . A hundred and five ? " " A hundred and five pounds , and the worst of it is , they do n't seem to know what 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty when we were married . Or maybe even a pound of two over that . Billy says it is n't cancer , he seems certain it is n't that . But he does n't offer any opinions about what it might be , so I 'm going to have this man in Philadelphia take a look at her and maybe he 'll be able to diagnose it . " " What kind of a specialist is he ? " " It 's something to do with the blood stream . The white corpuscles and the red corpuscles . You know how little I know about medicine . I was thinking of letting Malloy examine her . " " No , he 's a surgeon . " " I know he is , but at least it would be another opinion . " " I do n't think Billy would like to call him in for a consultation . Billy does n't like Malloy . " " Well , what Billy does n't like is too damn bad . If I had n't made the arrangements to take Mildred to Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't come . That 's medical ethics . Not as long as Billy'sp196your doctor . And Billy will do everything for you that Malloy can do . Malloy 'd probably send Mildred to a specialist too . Probably the same specialist . " " Well , probably . I 'm impatient because I do n't see any improvementat all . " " Is she in pain ? " " Well , not acute pain , but she 's so God damn weak , Joe . So God damn weak . You know for Mildred to weigh a hundred and five  --  well , there is n't much left on her bones any more . She does n't complain , but sometimes I think when she looks at me that she was begging me to do something . And what is there I can do ? " " What you 're doing . Take her to a specialist . Cheer up . He may discover what 's wrong with her right off the bat . " " Rose is going along with us , and if the examination takes more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mildred . " " Rose is a fine girl , fine . " " Devoted to Mildred . It 's the way sisters should be but they damn seldom arc , " said Arthur . " Nothing new at the office today , or of much importance . Karl Schneider was in . He wants to find out if we can sue the Pennsy for delaying putting in that spur . You know their new building , where they want sonic new trackage to take the place of the old siding . I told him to make haste slowly . If we went into court every time that wild Dutchman had a grievance . " " I agree with you . Has he paid his bill ? " " He paid it yesterday . I 'd be inclined to tell him to find another law firm , but they 're going to get bigger and bigger , Joe . And I understand the British are buying all the beef they can get their hands on , so let 's humor him for another couple of years . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility , but worth considering . We could be maneuvered into this war . " " If we were , would you go ? " " If we were invaded , of course I 'd go . So would you . " " It may not take an invasion to get us into it . " " What else would get us into it ? " " Well , suppose the Germans invaded Canada , " said Arthur . " Canada ? That would be the same as invading us . " " Or Mexico . " " Why would anybody want to invade Mexico ? I consider theGermans a stupid race of people , but who would be that stupid ? " " It would be a good way to invade us . Mexico first , then us . " " They 'd never get across the Rio Grande . "  | " The Mexican bandits do . " " But not a Mexican army . Not in a real war . And by the time the British and French are through with the Germans they wo n't have enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arthur . " " Well , you said it was a possibility . " " Yes , but highly improbable . About as unlikely as the Chinese invading California . We 're protected by two oceans and by Canada on the north , and to the south  --  well , we have nothing to fear there either . All the same , I wonder what I 'd do if I 'd just got out of college and had no matrimonial plans . What would you do ? " " I think I 'd enlist , in the Canadian Army . " " If you did I 'd go with you . " " I would n't go without you . " They laughed lightly . " It would be ridiculous , would n't it ? " said Joe . " And yet , you ca n't deny what the Germans did in Belgium . Especially to the Belgian women . Putting them in whore houses for the troops . When you hear things like that you wonder if it would be so ridiculous after all . You have to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Belgians the way they did . What must a Belgian father or husband feel when he hears what they did to his wife or daughter ? And they say the British are just as angry at those atrocities as the Belgians . Well , of course , the British sense of fair play . Code of decency and all that sort of thing . Have you thought of joining the National Guard ? Some of the fellows at the club were talking about it . " " I 'd rather wait awhile and see what happens . I do n't want to have to drill , and go to camp at Mount Gretna , and march in parades every time a Civil War veteran dies , " said Arthur . " No , that could be tiresome , " said Joe . " Drudgery , " said Arthur . " Well , we 're worrying about nothing . I 'm convinced that WoodrowWilson will keep us out of it . Not that I like Wilson , but he does n't even look warlike . And of course he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a football coach , " said Arthur , smiling . " He was ? I did n't know that . " " At Wesleyan . " " Wesleyan ? The Wesleyan at Middletown , Connecticut ? ThatWesleyan ? I thought he was Princeton through and through . " " I 'm sure he is , but he taught at Wesleyan , " said Arthur . " Howabout the young man upstairs ? Have you entered him at New Haven ? " " No , I never thought of it . Took it for granted . He 'll be the fifthp198in line to go to Yale , fifth generation , and maybe more . I 'll tell you what I have thought of : I 've thought of entering him in Groton . " " Groton ? Why not The Hill ? " " I have no strong feeling about The Hill . I was sent there because it was close to home , and it may be all right if you 're going to Penn or Princeton , but if my boy goes to Yale or Harvard I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea . " " Well  --  no . " " Why not ? " " Why do n't you send him to Eton ? " " Eton 's in England . " " Well , if you 're going to send your boy to a place that tries to be Eton , why not send him to the real thing instead ? " " Oh , I do n't think Groton tries to be Eton . " " Maybe not , but the fellows we knew that went there ... " " Dave Harrison went there . Alec went to Groton . You liked them . " " Did I ? " " Did n't you ? Now do n't tell me you did n't like Dave and Alec . " " I low often have I looked them up in New York ? " " You were an usher for Alec . " " With sixteen other fellows , or eighteen , or whatever it was . " " He was n't one of your ushers , " said Joe , remembering . " Why was n't he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur . " Alec got married as soon as he got out- of college . You and I waited a couple of years , and by that time Yale did n't mean quite as much to me as it had  --  if it ever did . I 'm not convinced that going to Yale was the best move I ever made . l 'm not sorry I went there , but I think I would have learned just as much at Lafayette . I 'm sure I would have learned more at Harvard . I was so damn busy being careful so I 'd make a senior society , and I did n't really give a damn about it except that I knew you were sure to make one , so I had to too . If I had a son , which I never will , I 'd send him to Gibbsville High and Penn State . " " You 're joking . " " No , I 'm not joking . I do n't recommend that for your son . Yourfather 's people have all gone to Yale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides . You can get just asgood an education at Muhlenberg as you can at Yale , and maybebetter with all those Pennsylvania Dutchmen and fewer distractions . " " Why , you do n't even know anybody that went to Muhlenberg. "  | " Yes I do . Old Judge Flickinger went to Muhlenberg . He studied law at Penn , but he went to Muhlenberg . Dr. Schwenk , the pastor of the Lutheran church . And half a dozen other men that I consider as well educated as any Yale men we have around here . " " You never see them . I 've never seen these educated men at your house . " " More 's the pity , Joe . I wish I knew some of them right now , to get an educated German-American 's views of this war . " " I 'm afraid they 'd be more German than American . " " Well , what if they were ? We 're making them feel like bastards , and some of them go back to pre-Revolutionary days . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Flickinger ? " " Well , I was n't thinking of him . I hardly know Dr. Schwenk . But we know men in this town that are sending money to Germany secretly . " " Well , we know others that are sending money to England openly . I happen to be one . I have cousins in England that I never saw , never expect to see , and if they knew I was talking like this I 'm sure they 'd return my money . But I 'm really tempted to send some money to the Germans too . " " You 're talking through your hat . " " Are n't we neutral ? Are n't we ? " " Officially , because Woodrow Wilson wants us to stay out of it . " " Very well , then if my sympathies cause me to send money to England , my belief in strict neutrality , the policy of our country , ought to cause me to send money to Germany . " " Well , do n't do it , because no matter what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know darn well whose side we 'll be on . " " Yes , and the Germans know it too . " " Well , they started it , and they 're going to be very sorry they did . " " Joe , that 's exactly the attitude that may result in your donning a uniform and fighting for your country . " " All right . If I have to . " Arthur helped himself to more whiskey and whistled an unrecognizabletune . They had the kind of friendship that permits quiet as well as argument , without nervous searching for conversational topics . Always the one who happened to be the visitor knew he could leave when he felt like it , comfortable in the knowledge that visits were only incidental to the whole relationship . " Edith asleep ? "  | " Mm-hmm , I think so . " Joe picked up the afternoon newspaper . " They had quite a big fire in Fort Penn . " " Yes , I saw that , " said Arthur . He sipped his drink . Joe read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanamaker 's ? " said Arthur . " Hmm ? " said Joe . " Arc those the shoes you got at Wanamaker 's ? " " These shoes ? No , I got these at Frank Brothers about two years ago . They were hard to break in , but now I like them . " Joe went hack to his newspaper and Arthur smoked his pipe , sipped his drink , whistled in between . Perhaps five minutes went by . Then Arthur stood up , but Joe did not ask him if he were leaving . He was not leaving . He went to the dictionary , spent a minute with it and sat down again . " What were you looking up ? " said Joe . " Parturition . " Joe laughed . " Oh , " he said . " I looked it up myself about eight months ago . " Ina little while lie finished with the newspaper . " What 's the name of the man Mildred 's going to sec ? " " I do n't remember . " " Not Deaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd never heard the name before . He has an office on ' Walnut Street . " " Well , I hope you remember the number , on Walnut Street . " " I have it all written down , and Billy telephoned him long distancelast week . " " I 'd like to drop in and say hello before she leaves . " " I 'd rather you did n't . She  --  " " You 're right , you 're right . It might alarm her . You 're absolutely right . " Joe nodded . " Make it seem like  --  nothing very serious , nothing to get alarmed over . I 'll send her a book to read on the train . " ' " That would be nice . " " Something light , humorous , " said Joe . " Would she like some candy ? You know Marian 's homemade candy . " " She loves Marian 's candy . " " You know , Arthur , it 's awful how much of our lives we spend just waiting , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I , first waiting to be sure she was going to have the baby , then waiting for her to have it . Now you , waiting to take poor Mildred to Philadelphia , and waiting there for what the doctor has to say . " " I know what he 's going to say , Joe . And that 's when the worst waiting begins . " " Oh , no . You do n't think it 's that bad . Do you really ? " Arthur nodded . " Whatever it is , it 's gone too far . And Mildred knows it too . We pretend , but we know . " " Oh , Jesus , Arthur . Here I am , so God damn happy , with my son . . . Arthur , I feel like a shit . I 've been no help to you at all . " " Oh , yes you have . Yes  --  you  --  have . " " Do n't be ashamed to cry . " " I 'm not ashamed . I was just hoping I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going upstairs . You stay here as long as you like , and do n't bother about the lights . I 'll turn them out when I go to bed . " " Thanks , Joe . " " And I 'm right here every night , you know that . " " I know , " said Arthur . " Congratulations . That 's really why I came . " Joe smiled and left him . Newness lasts longer in a small town than in a big city , whether the newness is on a private residence , a store building , a new baby  --  or , for that matter , a corpse . A new baby remains a fresh conversationaltopic long past his first birthday , just as a house that has sheltered a family for a full generation may continue to be referred to as a new house . And in the same way a man who has lost a loved one in March is still being told , in December , that " I 'm sorry for your trouble , " if the speaker is Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Joe Chapin thus was receiving expressions of sympathy ( and sorrow for his trouble ) while accepting the early congratulations on the birth of his son . As an example there was the case of Mike Slattery , when the two men had a chance meeting on Main Street . " Good morning , Joe , " said Mike . " Good morning , Mike , " said Joe . " The last time I talked to you was right on this very spot , " said Mike . " Only that time it was n't to congratulate you . "  | " I remember , " said Joe . " Very pleasant news . The mother and child both doing well , I trust ? I 've heard nothing to the contrary . " " Yes , they both seem to have benefited by the experience . " " Glad to hear it . I always admired Edith greatly . A fine woman . And little Nancy , is it ? " " Ann , " said Joe . " That 's right , Ann . I fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " " Oh , yes . And your little girls . You have three , have n't you , Mike ? " " Margaret , Monica , and Marie . In that order . All M 's , but no Michael so far . I told Peg , I said the next one is going to be Michael no matter what . " " Michelle 's a pretty name , in case you have another daughter . " " ' Thank you , thank you , " said Mike , with mild sarcasm . " But if you do n't mind , I 'd like a straight , plain Michael . A stem-winder , as the fellows say . Your boy is Joe Junior , I understand . " " Yes , Junior . We 're both named after my grandfather . " " Uh huh . The Joseph B. Chapin they named the school after . " " That 's the one . I guess they 're mostly little pickaninnies going to that school , but my grandfather would have been pleased with that . He was bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , Joe ? Was he in politics ? " " Oh , yes . He served one term as lieutenant governor . " " Lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania . I did n't know that . Your father was never active . " " No , Father never became interested in politics . I do n't know why , but I suppose because Mother was a semi-invalid . " " Of course . Well , Edith 's a fine , healthy woman . " " Yes . " " Edith is n't a semi or any kind of an invalid . " " No . " " Do you get what I 'm driving at ? " Joe smiled . " Possibly . " " It 'd be nice to have another Joseph B. Chapin in public life . " Joe smiled again . " Well , you might talk to my son when he gets old enough . " " I 'll talk to him when the time comes , but I 'd like to put the bee in your bonnet too . " " I 'm afraid not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows anything against you . Seriously , the party'sp203always desperate for the better-type young man . If fellows like von took a more active interest , politics would n't have such a bad reputa-tion . " " Thank you , Mike , but I 'm a lawyer . " " I never heard of that being a hindrance , not in politics . Invite me over to your house some evening when Edith can be present and I 'll tell you a few things about politics that you may not realize . " " You do n't think Edith would want me to go into politics . Why , Edith is one of the shyest girls I 've ever known . " " Well , I did n't say I was going to ask Edith to run for anything . I 'd just like you and Edith to know that politics can be the most respectable thing in the world . Do n't forget , Joe , the men we all look up to the most  --  Washington , Lincoln , Teddy  --  they were politicians , and darn good politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Just promise me you 'll speak to Edith , just tell her what I 've told you . Now I 've got to go and play some politics . Help a man get a pension that he 's entitled to , but on account of some red tape he 's on the verge of starvation . That 's politics , too , Joe . A lot of it is helping people get what they 're entitled to . Billy English can tell you some of the things we politicians do that you never hear about . " " Mike , you 're a scoundrel and I 've listened to too much already . Give my kindest regards to Peg . " " Thank you , Joe , and the same to Edith and Joe Junior and Ann , " said Mike . " I 'll never call her Nancy again . " When Joe came home that same evening Edith was at his desk in the den , writing letters . " I do n't think I 'll ever catch up on my correspondence , and yet before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . By the way , who do you think sent me the biggest bouquet of flowers today ? " " I do n't know , dear . Who ? " " The Slatterys . Mr. and Mrs. Michael J. Slattery . Michael James Slattery . No message , just the card . I looked under the envelope and the card is from Bailey 's . What ever possessed them to send me flowers ? " " Well , they 've always been friendly . I 've known both of them allmy life , and Mike was in my class at law school . We used to see eachother there , and ride home on the train together at Christmas time . " " Oh , I know them , I know them , but they do n't know me wellenough to send me flowers . To tell the truth , I ca n't stand her . Thatround pretty face and those clothes . I 've never seen her in the samep204thing twice  --  not that I ever see her much . But she always looks new and painted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean like a bad woman , but cheap . New . And there must be at least six dollars ' worth of roses . Now I 'll have to write to her , and I do n't want to write to her . I have no idea what to say to her . And what on earth does she want ? Her oldest child is in Miss Holton 's and I think she goes to dancing school . What else does she want ? " " They 're Irish , and the Irish are very kind people . Generous . And you 've just had a baby . " " I hope I do n't have to keep track of all their babies . They have three girls and I think another child on the way . Oh , she wants something , of that you may be sure . " " Well , let 's wait and sec what it is , " said Joe . The invitation Mike Slattery sought was not forthcoming , and he did not press the point , either of the invitation or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not immediately , Peg received a note from Edith Chapin : Dear Peg : I would like to offer belated thanks for the beautiful flowers you send when our son was born . They were exquisite . I hope this finds you and your family well . Sincerely , Edith S. Chapin ( Mrs. Joseph B. Chapin ) Peg Slattery read the note aloud to Mike , a custom they both followed even to household bills . " When did I send exquisite flowers to Madam Chapin ? " " I forgot to tell you . ' When you went to Scranton for Sheila 's First Communion ? " " Yes ? " " I happened to meet Joe Chapin on Main Street and we had a chat and I got an inspiration . It was n't an inspiration , meaning the first time I ever thought of it . I 've been thinking of it for quite a while . But while I was talking to him I planted the bee in his bonnet about him getting into politics . And what a lucky coincidence ! Becauseit came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph B. Chapin , was once the lieutenant governor . did you know that ? " " How would I know that ? " " Well , I did n't know it either , and it makes it so much easier , 1 told him the party needs young men like him , and if ever I spoke a true word in the form of flattery , that was it . A good old name , plenty of money that was n't stolen , at least stolen outright , and a handsome fellow with a good education . Married . Two young children . Protestant , but not an A.P.A . No scandals anywhere in the family . " " Edith 's father liked the bottle . " " But was he ever in trouble ? No . " " Joe 's mother . A long , long time ago she got in some mix-up on Christiana Street when they used to have all those saloons there . Mom told me about it . Charlotte Chapin was  --  oh , dear , now  --  there was something about a man lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he horsewhipped the man that got fresh with Charlotte . " " I never heard any of this , " said Mike . " It sounds crazy . " " It is n't , I can assure you . I have n't got it right because it 's so long since I thought about it . But I 'm pretty sure the coachman beat up the man ... " " Did the man climb in her carriage and get fresh ? " " No . She was walking . " " Oh , come on now , Peg . Charlotte Chapin would never walk through that section . " " Ah , she never did again , but this one time she was walking  --  " " Accompanied by the coachman with a whip , of course , " said Mike . " Never mind the sarcasm , " said Peg Slattery . " It all happened just about the way I 'm telling it . And after that , shortly after that , CharlotteChapin took to her bed and stayed there the rest of her life . Or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It could n't have been much if I never even heard of the incident , " said Mike . " Maybe not , but I 'd find out who the man was that the coachman beat up . " " Yes . This was what , about thirty years ago ? " " I could n't say . But around that , " said Peg . " So you sent some exquisite flowers to Edith Chapin  --  Mrs. Joseph B. , that is , just in case I might get her mixed up with the old lady who 's dead . You 're going to get at Joe through her , is that it ? " " More or less . "  | " It wo n't be hard . " " You think not ? What makes you think so ? According to Joe , she 'd have a horror of public life . " " Proving that Joe knows his wife no better than many husbands know their wives . I do n't say Edith 's a suffragette or one of those kind of women , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison . She has two children , four years apart , so it does n't look to me like she 's out to increase the population . And her house does n't take much to run it  --  time , I mean . Harry and Marian run that house to perfection or Old Lady Chapin would have sacked them long ago . Edith is n't interested in clothes . She dresses like someone that got her clothes at Cohen's-North Main . She does n't do much church work or charity . I 'd say Edith Chapin would relish being the wife of  --  what ? You would n't start him as an assemblyman . " " At first , I would n't run him for anything . Just get him acquainted around among the boys . Then later spring him on the public , and if they took to him , fine . He 's not going to cost anybody anything  --  " " Far from it . " " And you know he 's so gosh-darn respectable . And I like Joe . " " Well , why should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , good or bad , that I can see . Everything he is or has , he inherited . His good looks , his money , his name . The one thing he did n't inherit I consider a handicap , but maybe that 's because I can hardly look at her , she 's that ugly . " " Oh , you and Edith could never be friends in a thousand years , " said Mike , amiably . Peg looked at him straight . " Hmm , " she said . " What do you mean , hmm ? " " Never you mind , Mr. Michael James Slattery . I see through you , " said Peg . " I never said you did n't , " said Mike . He kissed her on the cheek and she pretended to suffer the kiss . " She 'd be no fun that way , " said Peg . He laughed , and she pushed him . " Go ' way from me , " she said . Joe Chapin 's political career could have ended with a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Joe , MikeSlattery would have said no more about Joe to her or anyone else . Ifshe had wanted to punish Joe for Edith 's shortcomings , Mike wouldhave so punished him . Mike in the first instance would have beenrelying , as he usually did , on Peg 's sound reactions to candidates . Inthe second instance he would have been no more than a loyal hus/band . But Peg , an equally loyal wife , was deeply and intensely interested in her husband 's business , which was politics , and she was above personal pettiness when it might affect that business . For her there was only one man in the world , and if other men were hurt or honored in the process of her man 's advancement , she was more than willing to dole out the honors and inflict the injuries . By the way that older men were coming to rely more and more on Mike 's judgment and delegate authority and responsibility , a duller woman than Peg could have told that Mike was already accepted as a senior member of the gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public honors  --  Governor of the Commonwealth , Presidentof the United States  --  but the compensation there was that governors and presidents get defeated and the mark of defeat is upon them , while politicans are often at their most powerful after a defeat . When a candidate has taken a licking the party needs the professionals like Mike , the full-time noncandidates , to reorganize for the next campaign . It is a simple enough rule , and it explains the mystery that sometimes baffles the public ( and defeated candidates ) : why , after a defeat , are the same old politicians still eating the big meals and smoking the expensive cigars ? Peg knew the answer to the mystery ; the best answer was her man , who was a full-time politician who would be eating the big meals and smoking the big cigars ( although he personally did not smoke ) no matter how many times Woodrow Wilson got elected president . Mike had laughingly turned down opportunities to become chief burgess of Gibbsville , county clerk , sheriff , register of wills , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mike , when asked to run for such offices , would always reply that his committee work was more important , which indeed it was . It was more important to the party , and it was much more important to Michael James Slattery , who did not want to be marked with an early defeat for a minor office . In the beginning , as soon as he got out of law school , Mike did work that demanded the qualifications of a moderately industriousoffice boy , not a man with a law degree . But he soon proved his ability and his dependability : a couple of times he was given sums of money to hand over to ward leaders . It was only a venial political sin to pocket some of that money on its way from the committeeto the ward leader : but when Mike was given $400 to deliver to a ward captain , the ward captain received $400 , not $375 . There would have been no comment and no disillusionment if Mike had paid himself a $25 delivery fee , but he early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are indispensable , but they invariably remain $25 men , and it is worth a great deal to a political organizationto find out who among their younger workers are above nervous larceny . The wiser old politicans were also pleased to note that Mike was not in any great hurry to go into the street-paving business or make premature demands for his share of legitimate county legal fees . The paving business and the receiverships came later , along with Mike 's partnership in an insurance firm and directorships on the boards of farseeing corporations . In the beginning Mike was content to wear out a lot of shoe leather and pay for it himself while building up what eventually became a personal organization without its becomingpublicly identified as the Slattery gang . In his entire career Mike was never once indicted . No ambitious district attorney could ever have shown that Mike had handed a man two dollars for his vote . Mike did not even buy the barrel of beer for a volunteer fire company . The beer got there , and it was well understood that Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mask his connection with it . And of course it is not illegal for a citizen to slake the thirst of a group of unpaid smoke eaters ; nor is it illegal for a public-spirited citizen to provide the ice cream and pretzels for a Lutheran Sunday School picnic ; nor is it illegal for the wife of some such citizen to make an appearance at the African M. E. Church for the funeral of a popular waiter , and if she happens to be accompanied by her husband and is the only white woman present , she and her husband may be kindly remembered by the members of the congregation . ( That particular funeral took place in 1915 , and Mike might have attended it without political intent , since he was genuinely fond of Clarence Whitehall . Twenty years later the Slatterys ' attendanceat a 1915 funeral was recalled by several important Negroes who were being invited to forsake the Republican party for the greener pastures of the New Deal . ) There were men and women who availed themselves of Mike 's services while withholding approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what was always called the Lantenengo Street crowd . There were two things the snobs did not know and never could believe : first , that Mike and Peg were reconciled to their social status , and wanted social preferments only for their children ; second , Mike 's activities as donor of ice cream and charitable intermediary were successful for one reason : he liked to do things for people . He was shrewd and perceptive and capable of ruthlessness , but he was also a man who took pleasure in administering kindnesses . He didp209many kindnesses automatically , instinctively , and without time for hope of reciprocal favors . On visits to the big cities he performed acts of generosity and kindness and politeness among strangers Who could not possibly know who he was and whose only way of returning the kindnesses was to acknowledge them with the words , " Thank you . " He was also quite capable of killing anyone who hurt his wife or his daughters . By killing is meant depriving of life . Mike could and did use the telephone , tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and translate Latin , explain the Dartmouth College Case , handle a pair of hackney ponies , understand the principle of the internal combustionengine , keep his temper , eat in moderation , outbox a stronger fellow , and observe all rules of personal cleanliness . He had come all the way with civilized man . But he was also quite capable of killing anyone who hurt his wife or his daughters . In all other matters he was tractable and sometimes eager , sometimes willing , to compromise . Moreover , he knew that about himself ; his ability to size up other men began with a rather thorough understanding of his own personality , an understanding which in part was traceable to frequent examinations of conscience before visiting the confessional . Because of his awareness of his extreme concern for his family , he was carefullyslow in adjudging offenders against their happiness or well-being . But when a man or woman was found guilty , Mike was thorough in his punishment . The negative fact that he did not commit murder was less valuable in an estimate of Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . After Peg had begun to understand Mike 's fierce protectiveness , her discovery taught her to exercise caution in reporting slights and wounds . Mike did not always agree with her estimates of men and women , but he believed everything factual that she told him . Her lesson was learned in the second year of their marriage . They were sitting at home one evening after supper , and Peg , in her recital of the events of her day , mentioned , casually , she thought , a happening that had annoyed her . " . . . I was buying the groceries and I had my arms full , and on my way out the door that Paul Tristram let the door swing on me and I dropped everything . " " He what ? He let the door swing on you ? " " Yes , it made me furious . I had to stop and pick up all my bundles off the floor . " " He did n't even help you pick them up ? " " No , he just looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . "  | " Oh , of course he knew . I said to him , What 's the matter with you , anyway ? ' " " And he could hear you ? " " Sure , he turned around , and then he kept on going . " " He did , eh ? " said Mike . He got up and put on his coat and hat and while walking to the door he said , " I 'll be back . " " ' What are you going to do ? " said Peg . He did not answer her . He first walked to the north side of town , where he knew Paul Tristram lived . He turned the handle of the doorbell , and Tristram 's wife opened the door . " Hello , " she said . " Is your husband in ? " " No , he ai n't . He ai n't in . I think he 's over't the hose company . " Mike nodded and left . The Perseverance Hook &; Ladder Companywas three blocks from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs to the social room , where there were a bar , a pool table , a poker table and chairs . Mike was not a member of the Perseverance , but he was greeted by the half-dozen men present , among them Paul Tristram . He went directly to Tristram and slapped his face . " You got ta learn some manners , Tristram , " said Mike . He then closed his fists and attacked Tristram with punches to the face and body , hammering him until he fell , and when he fell , Mike gave him a kick in the ribs . Mike for the first time addressed the others : " Let him tell you why I did it , " and left . It was not a fight ; it was a beating . Even Tristram 's friends suspected that it was a deserved beating , although they could not be sure what had provoked it . If it had been a fight they might have felt called upon to take Tristram 's side , during the fighting and in the years that followed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track down and punish someone who has insulted his wife , the sober man is given the benefit of the doubt . The incident may have cost Mike six votes , but no more , and it gained him that many among members of the Perseverance Company who until that time had had no feeling about him one way or the other . The story got around Gibbsville in three or four days . It annoyed Mike , and he kept it out of his conversations by refusing to discuss it . But it remained a part of the Mike Slattery legend . It did not reach the ears of the ladies of the Gibbsville upper crust , although there was hardly a man in the Gibbsville Club who did not hear of it . Among them were some men who were just beginning to hear of Mike , and when they were told that it had not been a typical Irishp211brawl , Mike suffered not at all in their estimation . As to Peg , she cared little enough about what other women thought , and the incident embarrassed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice before saying anything that might arouse her man . Opportunities to influence Edith Chapin were not often given Mike Slattery and he decided to create one . He considered the various men friends of the Chapins , immediately ruling out Arthur McHenry as too obvious and too close . Next in the friendly relationship  --  although a distant second  --  was Henry Laubach . Henry Laubach belonged to a family that was accustomed to hearingits name pronounced two ways : among the Lantenengo Street people , Laubach was pronounced Law-back . All other citizens of Gibbsville pronounced it Lab-bock . Henry belonged to the first generation to use the American pronunciation , which was considered less Dutchy . The family dated from pre-Revolutionary times and intermarriagehad bred out most of the obvious German characteristics , so that Henry could easily have called himself Lowell and no New Englanderwould have disbelieved him on account of his cranial or facial details . Born the same year as Joe Chapin , Henry was literally a boy Joe had grown up with . When Joe went to The Hill , Henry 's familysent him to Mercersburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students , and Phi Beta Kappa . He worked for the golden key because his father , who had retained a few of the old German traditions , believed that a boy went to college to learn something . The key was satisfactory evidence of Henry 's obedience , and earned him a present of $2,000 . Laubach &; Company was a family firm , wholly owned by Laubachsand first cousins , which invested Laubach money and made Laubach profits ; collected Laubach rentals , clipped Laubach coupons , and protected the Laubach name . The embossed letterhead contained no more than the name , in script , and the address , in Roman , and revealed nothing of the powers and activities of the firm or of the sub-corporations owned by Laubach &; Company . It was not generally known , for example , that the firm was entitled to function as a private bank and agent for several steamship lines , rather more for the convenience of the firm than for the public . Visitors were not encouraged at the firm 's offices : the window in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private , and the request , Please Knock , to indicate the firm 's attitude toward casual callers . The firm was so set in its ways that when someone did knock , it was extremely likely that Ise had no business there , and was stared at accordingly by the officersp212and staff . Joe Chapin , Arthur McHenry , and a very few other men could drop in for business or non-business chats . But most men , including the Chapins and the McHenrys , were seen by appointment . Henry believed in his father 's motto that an office was not a Kaffeeklatsch . In the office of Laubach &; Company there was not so much as a family portrait on the walls . Henry Laubach answered his own telephone , and when Mike Slatteryasked him for ten minutes of his valuable time , Henry was already deciding how much financial support he would give the party before Mike hung up . Mike , as always , was punctual , arriving in Henry 's office at two minutes before three o'clock . Henry signaled to him to come to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said Henry . " Very well , thank you , Henry . And all goes well with you , I trust ? " " About as usual , " said Henry . He opened a mahogany humidor and held it out to his visitor . " Offer you a cigar ? " " Never use them , Henry , " said Mike . " Never use them . No bad habits except politics . " " Well , I hardly ever indulge , myself , except after a heavy meal . I like a good cigar , but sometimes a week 'll pass without one . " " No doubt you must be thinking I 'm a little early this year , Henry . " " A little early ? " " For a campaign contribution . " " Well , it is a little early , is n't it ? " said Henry . " I 'm squeezing in an extra visit because this time I 'm not here to ask you for money . " " Well , it 's always a pleasure to hear that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ? " " It 's a difficult problem , political problem . I know you 're a busy man , so I wo n't take up too much of your time with a lot of beating about the bush . " " I 'd appreciate that , but not because I do n't enjoy your company . " " ' Thank you , Henry . Well , it boils down to this : I have been weighingall the pros and cons , and I 've come to the conclusion that we ought to try to persuade Joe Chapin to take a more active interest in party matters . " " Joe Chapin , eh ? " said Henry . " Joe Chapin . " " How does that sound to you ? "  | " Well , I know he never has been active in politics . But of course that 's no reason why he should n't start now . His father never rim for office , but his grandfather was lieutenant governor . Long before our time , of course , but that was as close as Gibbsville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering now is why you came to inc . Joe 's one of my best friends , but I do n't think I 'd like to try to influence him in a matter of that kind . Granting I could influence him . " " This is the hard part , Henry , and I do n't want you to refuse me out of hand . " " Oh , I never do that . I always listen to whatever the other fellow has to say . " " Fine . Now do n't be surprised , what I 'm going to say . " " Ca n't promise you that , not knowing what you have up your sleeve , " said Henry . " All right , then . I believe you 're a cousin of Edith Chapin 's , are you not ? " " Not a first cousin , but I 'm related to Edith . You could say I wasrelated to Joe , too , but I 'm a little more closely related to Edith . " " And you and your good wife are friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . Yes indeed . " " Good . Good . Now here is where I need your help . I think  --  and I believe I 'm right  --  that if her friends could convince Edith that it would be a good thing for Joe to take a more active interest in party matters , Edith could do the trick . " " Oh , I 'm afraid  --  Mike , that 's the kind of thing I always stay out of . Family matters . No , that 's none of my affair . " " I 'm not a bit surprised , Henry . I respect you for that , but I have n't asked you to do anything yet , have I ? " " No , but you 're going to , I have a feeling . " " For the time being , if the subject comes up , of Joe going into politics and if you believe it 's a good idea , will you tell Edith you think it 's a good idea ? " " Well , I might do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you 're going to want something else . " " You 're right , I am . If the subject comes up , and you tell Edith you think it 's a good idea , and she asks you any more about it , will You say to her , Why do n't you ask Mike Slattery ? ' " " Why do n't you ask Mike Slattery ? ' I 'd have to think about that , Mike . " " But if she wanted to know , there 'd be no harm in saying that to her . "  | " No , I suppose not . All right , I guess I could say that much withoutincriminating myself . If she asked me , it would n't be sticking my nose in her family affairs . Yes , I guess I can do that much . " " I 'd appreciate it , and I know it would be a good thing for the party . I 'd also appreciate anything else you did that might influence Joe in the right direction . Men like you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't have you mention my name in any political connection whatsoever . I mean that . " " Henry , 1 would n't think of it . I know exactly how you feel . That 's why I did n't ask you in the first place . " " Just as long as you understand that . If you ever get me mixed up in politics , I 'll send my contributions to the Democrats , and I mean that , too . Joe 's a lawyer , and if he wants to go into politics , that 's his business . But not me . We want to stay anonymous . We always have , and we always intend to . " " 1 'll respect your wishes to the letter , and thank you for these few minutes of your valuable time . So long , Henry . " " So long , Mike , " said Henry . Mike had no difficulty in respecting Henry 's wishes . He would have had , as he told Peg , trouble getting Henry elected dog-catcher , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , dog-catcher had been an appointive , not an elective , office . It disappeared from the municipal table because for several terms nobody wanted the job . When the function was restored , in 1920 , it was under the auspices of the Gibbsville chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , with a full-time employee who was sworn as a special constable , but not as a public servant on the public payroll . Interestingly enough , one of the leading supporters of the Society , and thus a contributor to the dog-catcher 's salary , was Josephine Laubach , Henry 's wife . The dog-catcher selected by the Society was a man named Pierson , a distant cousin of the HowardPierson who later married the Slatterys '  --  in 1916  --  unborn daughter . In a small town the most casual remark can have constant repercussions . The threat of Woodrow Wilson made for a revival of interest in politics that was somewhat stronger than the usual reanimation which occurs in a presidential year . Mr. Hughes , with his whiskers , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the appearance of a man who had a schoolteacher 's switch hidden in the folds of his Prince Albert . Mr. Hughes was a Republican ; but Mr. Wilson was a Democrat who had kept us out of war and who was not a horse to swap in midstream . Mr. Hughes was not in the least warlike ; Mr.Wil/on had sent the National Guard and Black Jack Pershing to the Mexican border , ostensibly to punish the bandits , but actually to train an army and to show the Central Powers that we were getting ready and would have no nonsense . But if we were having no nonsense , was it not time that we stopped sending Notes when our ships , flying our flag , were torpedoed on the high seas ? Mr. Wilson was pussyfooting , keeping us out of war and hurrying us into it with his warlike gestures . There was no argument in favor of Wilson that could not be answered with the countercharge of inconsistency , and as the people of Republican Gibbsville turned out their lights they were able to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon take over and Woodrow Wilson would be politely banished to Princeton . Joe Chapin was more bitterly disappointed than Arthur McHenry . " Those people out in California , " said Joe . " They 're so far away from everything they have no idea what 's happening . " " It 's a long distance away , " said Arthur . " As far from us as we are from Europe . " " With one big difference . What 's next to California ? Nevada . There are no German submarines in Nevada , but there are off theJersey coast . That 's how much closer we are than those Californians . " " Well , like it or not , we have four more years of Mr. Wilson . " " Yes , and the prospect  --  it makes me want to do something . " " Well , you did something in this campaign . " " What , Arthur ? I gave some money , and I had my name on some letterheads . " " Do n't underestimate either . Your name is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name plus your money  --  it 's the first time you 've ever let them use your name . Speaking of which , I meant to tell you this before . You 'd better give Bob Hooker a better photograph of yourself . The other day , just for the fun of it , I drew a pair of glasses on your picture  --  Joe , that picture makes you look like Woodrow Wilson . " " You 're not the first one to tell me that . Edith mentioned it . I never take a good picture . " " Well , you 'd better get a different one if you 're going to be in politics . " " I 'm not going to be in politics . I 'm a partner in McHenry &; Chapin , attorneys-at-law . But I 'm interested in good government and the future of the Republican party , and as Edith says , if Vance McCormick can stand up for the Democrats , I can stand up for our side . "  | " We 're soon going to have to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Arthur . " To get bigger or not to get bigger ? " " Exactly , " said Arthur . " I do n't think you had this in mind , but if you should become influential in politics , very influential , we 're going to be attracting a lot more business . Some of it we wo n't want . That 'll be the people who will want us to handle their legal affairs because we may , just may , have political influence . Then of course there 's the other side . There will be some clients who will leave us because we 're mixed up in politics . " " I 've had occasion to think about that lately , " said Joe . " I met a man iii Philadelphia the other day . When he heard my name he asked me if I were the McHenry &; Chapin Chapin , and when I said I was he gave me his card . He has a construction business . I have the card at home . Name I never heard of . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur . " He said if I ever came to Pittsburgh to drop in and see him . I said , well , if lie ever came to Gibbsville to drop in and see us . That was all . " " ' That was all for the present , " said Arthur . " How did you meet this fellow ? " " The clay I had lunch at the Union League . You know , with Kirkpatrick . Kirkpatrick introduced me to him . " " Well , I had a chat with Henry Laubach yesterday , at the GibbsvilleClub . Henry never comes to the point if he can help it , but I can usually tell what he 's thinking . I would say , reading between the lines , that Henry tried to tell me that if we became a political law firm , we 'd have to struggle along without Laubach &; Company . Joe , I think we ought to go easy on this whole thing . I do n't like your friend from Pittsburgh , whose name you do n't remember . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know about him is that he 's in the construction business . But we also know that Council is going to ask for bids on paving South Main . " Joe smiled . " I spied that connection right away , " he said . " I hoped you would , " said Arthur . " Laubach &; Company were almost our first clients , and they were my father 's clients before you and I hung out our shingle . Now we may decide that we want to get bigger , expand . But let 's not take the first business that comes our way . And let 's be very careful about taking on construction companicsfrom Pittsburgh . If they 're any good they have their legal businesstaken care of by a Pittsburgh firm . If they 're not taken care of by a Pittsburgh firm , they 're probably fly-by-night. "  | " I agree , " said Joe . " You may want to run for office , and that might be a good idea . But without talking like Henry Laubach , I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oppose taking new business that looks as though it came our way through politics , or your political connections . You do n't need the money , and while I have n't got as much money as you have , I do n't need the money . We 're doing very well now , and we 'll continue to do very well and better as our firm gets older . " Joe nodded slowly and seriously . " I 'll tell you what my ambition is , as far as money 's concerned . I would like to be able to leave my wife and children each a million dollars . " " You have quite a way to go , " said Arthur . " But we ought to be good for many more and prosperous years . You could do it . But you 're going to have to do it through investments and the stock market . Not through our profits as McHenry &; Chapin . " " Let 's have this talk again a year from now , " said Joe . " Why , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Arthur . " You may want to go out after that big business  --  and maybe I might change my mind . " " I doubt it , " said Joe , smiling . " So do I , " said Arthur . " But if I see you getting rich ... " " I know what you 're thinking , Arthur , " said Joe . " Yes , I imagine you do , " said Arthur . " Am I thinking that I have no children to leave it to ? " " You do n't want to talk about Mildred , " said Joe . " You 're the only one I do talk to . " " But not enough , " said Joe . " Do n't you ever talk to Rose ? " " Rose ? Not about Mildred . Rose misses Mildred as much as I do . We do n't even want to see each other . " " I think you and Rose ought to get married , " said Joe . " You what ? " " Do n't hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's idea ? " " It 's my own idea , and I never thought of it till just this minute . " " Well , get rid of it quick , and do n't ever repeat it . Do n't ever say hat again . " " I 'm sorry , Arthur , but it 's what I think . I think you and Rose would be perfect for each other . " " I thought you knew me . That is the most cold-blooded statement ou 've ever made . " " Why ? " said Joe.  | " Because it is . I should n't have to explain why . " " Even so , why ? " said Joe . " Mildred has n't been dead a year , but you suggest not only that I get married , but that I marry her sister . " Joe looked away from him . " Well , I was in love with a girl , and she died . She died without my marrying her . And she was in love with me . Then I fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can happen twice , and it can happen very quickly . In some ways you 're so much more intelligent than I am , but in other ways  --  Arthur , Rose has been in love with you for years . And I think it 's damned unfair of you to let her become an old maid . She will , too , you know . Has she any beaux ? " " No . Or at least I 'm sure I do n't know . " " Yes you do . You know . Be honest . Rose White made the best of it when you married Mildred , but  --  let me ask you something , and give me a word-of-honor answer . Are you in love with Rose ? " " Yes , " said Arthur . " Now are n't you glad you told me the truth , Arthur ? " " No , I 'm not , not a bit glad . " Joc took the receiver off the hook and spoke into the telephone : " Six-four , please . " " What arc you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , Rose ? This is Joe Chapin . Arthur wants to speak to you . " He got up and transferred the receiver into Arthur 's hand . Frowning and bewildered , Arthur spoke : " Rose , this is Arthur ... No , there 's nothing wrong . He just called your number and handed me the phone . Will you be home this evening ? . . . Could I drop in for a minute ? hat would be fine . . . Good-bye . " " You 're so punctilious , if that 's the word I mean , " said Joe . " So proper . " " Well , you 're not , I must say . I was afraid you were going ... " " I thought of it , and I almost did . But it 'll be more punctilious if you tell her yourself , " said Joe . " This may change your attitude towardmaking money . " " What made you act as Cupid ? " said Arthur . " It 's something nev for you . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts you thinkingalong those lines . You 're too old for Ann , and in fact you 're getting too old for Rose , but you 're marriageable . " " Are you sure Edith had nothing to do with this ? " " Edith not only had nothing to do with it , I do n't want you top219ever say anything to her about this . Edith has altogether different ideas about me . In fact , I do n't think anybody really knows inc . If they did  --  oh , well . " Arthur put his hand on Joe 's shoulder , a display of intimacy he had never made before . " You know , Joe . You 're a very kind man . " Joe looked at his own hand . " That 'll be enough of that , please , " he said . Arthur smiled and left his friend without looking back . On an afternoon in April of 1917 the partners met in Arthur 's office . They talked for an hour and more , then Arthur summed up . " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can decide it is to toss a coin . " " Here 's my cartwheel , " said Joe . " You toss it and I 'll call it . " Arthur flipped the coin and while it was in the air Joe called , " Tails . " It was heads . " I win , " said Arthur . " Wait a minute , " said Joe . " What were we tossing for ? We should have agreed on that first . " " The winner joins the Army , " said Arthur . " That was n't agreed upon . I insist on another call . This time , if it 's heads , you join the Army , and tails , I join the Army . " " Well  --  all right , " said Arthur . He tossed again , and again it came up heads . " I furnished the coin , but I lost anyway , " said Joe . " You lost twice , if you want to be honest about it . " " Oh , well , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the Germans will quit now that we 're in it . " " Sour grapes from a bad loser , " said Arthur . " They do n't really want men of thirty-five . " " I 'm still thirty-four . " " Especially people who are out of shape and never take any exer-cise . " " But I had a complete physical examination a month ago and Billy English says I 'm in excellent condition , excellent . I think you forget , I took out more insurance for Rose . " " That was considerate of you , but I 'm sure she wo n't need it . Take my advice and write a letter to the Judge Advocate General , that 's where you 'll be most useful , out of the way . You a soldier ! Hoch der Kaiser ! "
