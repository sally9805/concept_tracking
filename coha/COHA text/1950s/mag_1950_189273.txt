Among the low , brown hills of eastern Tennessee stands a factory whose total product for 1949 weighed less than 1/10,000th of an ounce . The weight of its average shipment is less than that of the graphite in a penciled signature ; the container usually weighs a billion times more . Yet the products of this factory , the radioisotope plant at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , have already revolutionized many branches of science . <P> Last week the laboratory showed off some new and weird equipment designed to make isotope production both faster and safer . The isotopes are made by a chain-reacting pile in a pale green , blocky building . Some of them are fission products that accumulate in the pile 's uranium fuel . Others are formed in aluminum cans of raw material " cooked " by the pile 's neutrons . <P> Cooling the Cans . When the cans first come out of the pile they are fiercely radioactive . Men with long poles flip them into thick-walled lead tunnels to cool off . After eight hours , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' milder-mannered contents are safe enough to work on . <P> The isotopes are separated and purified in a row of deceptively cheerful-looking small buildings . Through the aluminum sheathing seep floods of deadly rays . The workers inside , protected by thick barriers ' , are safer than an interloper blundering close to the outside walls . <P> Most of the processing work is done by remote control . The quieter isotopes can be watched through glass or plastic . The stronger ones must be watched with mirrors , as Perseus watched Medusa reflected in his polished shield . The gamma rays they send out pass right through a mirror and do not strike the worker who is watching from one side . <P> Safety Showers . The whole plant , even the lavatories , swarms with watchful Geiger counters . They are usually clicking phlegmatically , but they can roar a sudden warning if anything goes wrong . In each building is a place on the floor marked " shower . " A worker who has spilled a dangerous substance on his clothes can dash to the shower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stored for packing in a long brick building . The innocent-looking bottles stand on racks behind a high , thick barrier . Watching their work in mirrors , the shipping clerks select a bottle . With remote-control devices that unscrew the bottle 's cap , they take out a measured amount of liquid , put it into another bottle and seal it in the proper container , which may contain several hundred pounds of lead . <P> No one breathes a sigh of relief when the dangerous stuff goes off the grounds . The work has become routine ; last year the plant made 4,715 shipments , an increase of 56% over 1947 . Each shipment , besides accomplishing important scientific tasks , . trained more people to deal with the perils of the developing Atomic Age .
