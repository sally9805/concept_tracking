txt Defeat of the proposed rapid-transit extension from Boston to Newton came as a surprise to most observers of the transportation scene , but the issue has not been finally killed . Following the Metropolitan Transit . Authority advisory board 's 84.09 per cent vote yesterday in favor of the extension , when 85 per cent approval was needed , Mayor Hynes said that he would call another meeting of the board in two weeks or so if the issue is again presented by the MTA trustees . The trustees would issue no statement today , but it was learned that they feel they have done all they can at the moment and will stand pat , relying on the nine cities and towns which voted for the extension to swing one or two of the remaining five to their viewpoint . The communities that voted against the proposal were Newton , Brookline , Cambridge , and Watertown . Belmont did not send a representative to the meeting . Statements Issued It is not expected that Newton and Brookline , through which the proposed line would run over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will back away from their vociferous opposition . Together , Newton and Brookline possess a 5.5 per cent vote on the advisory board , a figure set by a 1956 passenger count and equal , to the amount of deficit paid by the two communities . Statements obtained today from representatives of the three remaining communities indicated that some hope exists for increasing the favorable vote - by the needed 1 per cent but that more persuasive arguments will have to be mustered by the proponents to show that the rapidly increasing . MTA deficit will be diminished and not increased by the Newton extension . " All my judgments are tentative . If more data come in to cause me to change my mind I would be willing to listen to the data , " Cambridge City Manage ? John J. Curry said . Auto Ties Cited " I did n't believe a case was made out to show that the MTA was going to get the potential passengers it was counting on , " he explained . " Most of the people in that area ( Newton and Brookline ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are bound to their cars . " You could hold down farz 's and provide service and still not get riders . It all comes down to whether or not you can get a man out of his automobile , and the MTA has not demonstrated its ability to do this on its present lines . " Cambridge had an 8.45 per cent vote on the advisory board . Edmund J. O'Connell , chairman of the Watertown selectman , who held a 1.4 per cent vote , explained , " I figured that if I voted no I could always change my vote to yes , whereas if I voted yes I could never change to no . " Mr. O'Connell said that he would consider himself " remiss " in his duty to his town if he did not vote yes upon receiving evidence satisfactory to . him that the Newton extension would reduce the deficit . Watertown did not stand to benefit from the service so it is only a " matter of cold , hard cash " and whether the deficit can be reduced , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Selectmen , said he . purposely stayed away from the meeting because he had " reason to believe " that his vote would not be needed to kill the project . He said he opposes the extension more strongly than does Mayor Howard Whitmore , Jr. , of Newton , who has been its chief detractor . " The whole policy of the MTA is wrong , in that they feel cost is not material because if there is any loss it can be assessed on the cities and towns , " Mr. Flett said . He said he was in favor of forcing the MTA to live within a specified budget and conditioning any further rapid-transit extensions on its ability to carry its own weight . He said he felt the Newton extension would add to the deficit . Belmont has a 0.9 per cent vote on the Advisory Board . Proponents of the MTA extension hold that the line would earn a profit of $368,000 a year , but Newton and Brookline spokesmen have challenged this strongly . The . rapid-transit-extension bill passed the Legislature rather easily this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next-scheduled step , if advisory board approval had been obtained , was submission of engineering plans to the State Public Utilities Commission . It is known that MTA officials feel that any discrepancies which might have existed in their figures could have been ironed out by the PUC . Prospects Dimmed The last major step in the process would be gaining the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission for abandonment of the line by the Boston &; Albany Railroad in favor of the MTA service . Many observers have felt that future extensions of the MTA into the suburbs depended on how well the Newton line performed in bringing in work ers and shoppers from the suburbs . With prospects for final approval now considerably dimmer , they are wondering if the MTA deficit problem ever . will be solved in realistic fashion . Cambridge 's City Manager declined to comment directly on how the rejection of the Newton line would affect his community 's past efforts to extend the Harvard Square rapid transit tunnel to Arlington . He said he would " let the MTA trustees decide " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
