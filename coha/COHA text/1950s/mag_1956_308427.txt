The popeyed , bushy-haired little man had scarcely raised his baton to signal the opening of the piano concerto 's slow movement when he paled and swayed on the podium . Soloist Vera Franceschi swiftly signaled the sound engineers to stop the recording . Then she helped Conductor Franco Ferrara to a chair , plied him with black coffee . Ten minutes later he rapped the Santa Cecilia Orchestra of Rome to silence , led them the rest of the way through a singing recording of Ildebrando Pizzetti 's Canti della Stagione Alta . <P> The performance was an important step toward the recovery of an ailing man whom Arturo Toscanini once called " the greatest musical find of this century . " Sicilian-born Conductor Ferrara , 45 , guest-conducted the major orchestras of Italy in the ' 30s and early ' 40s , became his country 's most famed conductor after Toscanini himself . But one day in 1940 , while conducting Dvorak 's " New World " Symphony , Ferrara suddenly stiffened and crashed backwards off the podium in a dead faint . In the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became known throughout Italy as " The Fainting Maestro . " When he consulted doctors , they could only point out what he already knew : that he lost his genial manner in the presence of music and that his nervous tension built up to a fainting spell , usually as the orchestra approached the slow movement of the symphony or concerto he was conducting . <P> Sorrowfully , Ferrara gave up conducting , retired to a hermit-like existence . When San Francisco-born Pianist Franceschi , an old friend , arrived in Rome this spring on a recital tour , she took to visiting Ferrara to play him his favorite sonatas . Slowly she reawakened his interest , at last persuaded him to conduct an orchestra with herself as soloist for a series of recordings . Under Soloist Franceschi 's watchful eye , the recordings were completed . It seemed this week that Conductor Ferrara may at last be licking his old weakness . Vera Franceschi is sure of it . She plans to bring him to the U.S. this fall , put him in the hands of competent doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I can help it , " says she , " he 'll never faint again . "
