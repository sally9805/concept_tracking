For the troubled U.S. farmer , the Agriculture Department reported happy news . Farm prices in mid-May climbed 3% , the fourth straight monthly rise and one of the biggest jumps in years . Potatoes , fruit , hogs , lamb and cattle all rose ; in some areas prices for meat on the hoof were up as much as 6% . As a result the overall farm index jumped to 242% of the 1910-14 average , only two points below last year 's level .
