From Houston and Albuquerque , El Paso and Denver , tough-trading oilmen from every major company have been converging on the Four Corners area of Utah , Arizona , Colorado and New Mexico to get in on one of the biggest oil rushes in U.S. history . The sellers : the Navajo Indians , who are fast learning to play what oilmen call " grunt and groan . " As the bids for oil lands are announced , the tribesmen merely grunt , and as the prices soar higher , the oilmen groan . <P> Last week the groans were rising to a new crescendo . In the first 230,000-acre sale four weeks ago , 23 oil companies paid $27.5 million for leases , plus a 12% royalty on every barrel of oil produced . A fortnight ago the Navajos got $3.2 million for a second 82,200-acre block of land . Last week a third and final 158,505 acres went on sale , brought $2.9 million and pushed the total Navajo take to $33.6 million . <P> What sent the bids soaring was the promise of the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttes and mesas . Texas Co. , which had started exploring the area about three years ago , recently drilled its exploratory Navajo C-4 well on tribal land located between the big Aneth oilfield in San Juan County , Utah and another series of proven wells farther south . Texas Co. wanted to find out how far the Aneth field went and whether the two pools might be connected . Though Texas Co. tried to keep the well secret , every oilman suspected that something big was happening . At the first sale a combine of Pure Oil Co. , Ohio Oil Co. and Sun Oil Co. bid $7,941,000 for a nearby 2,500-acre lease , nearly $3,200 an acre and $2,500 more than Navajo land had ever brought before . <P> After the sale Texas Co. announced that its Navajo C-4 was indeed a producing well , pumping an average 642 bbls. of high-grade oil daily , and oilmen felt much of the nearby leasehold could be considered proven oil land . Then two more wells came in on Navajo land . Superior Oil brought in its Navajo B-1 well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Desert Creek No. 1 well . <P> For the 78,000 Navajos , one of the poorest Indian tribes ( per capita income in 1955 : $420 ) , the cash from the auctions added up to $423 per capita , will double the tribal income this year , provide money for new reservation roads , schools and irrigation projects . Said a Navajo brave : " Let the white man have the oil . My people want irrigated lands . We now know how we can get them . " <P> <P> The Navajos are not the only lucky Indians ; lease payments to other tribes are also skyrocketing . In 1951 Indians got $13 million from oil and gas leases . Last year their income soared to $41 million and is still climbing fast . Oklahoma 's Osage tribe alone took in some $11 million last year , split it into $7,000 packets for the holders of " head rights , " i.e. , ownership shares of reservation land . Other tribes , such as Montana 's Crow and Blackfeet , Colorado 's Utes and Utah 's Uintah-Ourays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year Colorado 's Southern Ute tribe signed a contract with Blue Cross and Blue Shield for group medical insurance , while New Mexico 's Jicarilla Apaches have been able to set up a $1,000,000 scholarship fund to give their youngsters a college education .
