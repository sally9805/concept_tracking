SCHOOL INTEGRATION IN THE SOUTH <P> AT THE time the Supreme Court struck down the old separate-but-equal doctrine , on May 17 , 1954 , public school segregation was maintained by law in 17 states and in the District of Columbia . Last week , with a new school semester under way , a few headline-making blots of disorder in the South obscured the fact that approximately 122,000 Negro children are actually sitting in Southern classrooms with white children in formerly segregated schools . And this figure does not take in the federally operated schools ( e.g. , on military posts ) that have integrated since May 1954 , or Roman Catholic parochial schools , which in several Southern states are well ahead of state schools in integration . <P> Integration 's most striking success story unfolded right in the nation 's capital . Prodded by President Eisenhower 's appeal for trailblazing , the District of Columbia 's board of education was ready with an integration plan one week after the Supreme Court handed down its decision . At first white high-school students boycotted classes and booed Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sternly threatened to ban troublemakers from athletic teams and other extracurricular activities . Washington , D.C. schools are now fully integrated ( but 20% of the Negro schoolchildren , living in Negro neighborhoods , go to all-Negro schools ) , and 58,500 Negroes attend classes along with white children in what one school official called a " miracle of social adjustment . " The rapid march to total integration is all the more noteworthy because Negroes make up a 68% majority among District of Columbia public school children . <P> <P> Border States <P> None of the states have carried integration quite so far as the District of Columbia , but the six Border States , on the whole , have made heartening progress . Three-fourths of their 800 school districts with both white and Negro pupils have at least started along the path , and some 60,000 Negro children are attending integrated schools . Every one of the tax-supported colleges and universities in the six states is open to Negroes . <P> Delaware . Out of 61 school districts with both white and Negro children , 18 have wholly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern half of the state still segregated . But the U.S. District Court has ordered the easygoing state board of education , which had left integration up to local choice , to draw up a statewide integration program . <P> Kentucky . About 80% of the state 's Negro children live in school districts that have made at least a start toward integration . The semester just begun has seen no serious disorder even in the coal town of Sturgis , where only a year ago a white mob turned back Negro pupils trying to enter the white high school . <P> Maryland . Baltimore undertook integration promptly after the Supreme Court 's decision , and counties soon began following along . After the southernmost county on the Western Shore admitted Negroes to white schools last fortnight , only two counties out of 23 remained 100% segregated .
