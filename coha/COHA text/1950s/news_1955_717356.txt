I. 0. , reached agreement on a new two-and-a-half year contract , granting wage increases of 17 cents an hour over that period to 37,000 employes . Present wages range from 4.561 , an hour for fully qualified watchmen to $2.27 for assistant structural foremen . Ex. perienced motormen earn $2.15 an hour . Joseph E. O'Grady , authority member in charge of labor relations , said the package would cost more than $30,000,000 . But he and Charles L. Patterson , chairman , emphasized that it could be paid for out of revenues without increasing the 15-cent fare . This point of view was shared by Michael J. Quill , union president . He said he was confident no fare rise would be necessary . Moreover , he declared that the agreement ushered in " a new era of peaceful labor relations for those who ride the subways . " After weeks of negotiations , both sides were plainly elated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the main consideration for the authority was extension of the present contract beyond its termination date of June 30 , 1956 . To Press Drive for Revenue " We now have two years to turn our attention to the main job of winning back the revenue the transit system has lost in recent years , " he said . " I am sure that revenue is there . Where , I 'm not certain , but we ' are going to find it . " For his part , Mr. Quill was delighted ? and relieved ? to have won his demand for a 17-cent in. crease . Of course , when he originally made it , his objective was to gain it without extending the contract . The agreement was reached after a full day of negotiations at the authority 's offices , 370 Jay Street , Brooklyn . Mr. Quill and Matthew Guinan , president of Local 100 , brought along with them a full complement of union officials and the entire fortyman executive board of the local . Mr. Quill announced that the board had accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also greeted the details of the agreement enthusiastically last night at St. Nicho. las Arena , 69 West Sixty-sixth Street . At the membership meeting , Mr. Quill ran into only frag. mentary opposition . The assemblage voted without dissent to submit the agreement to a se ? cret ballot vote next week . Stoppage Called Off Immediately after announcing the settlement , Mr. Quill called off a half-day work stoppage by 11,000 nonoperating personnel set for tomorrow . The demonstration ? a pressure device  --  was to have begun at noon opposite City Hall on Murray Street . These are the details of the agreement : There will be an increase of 7 cents an hour retroactive to last March 15 , when the existing contract was reopened for wage talks . Another 7 cents an hour will find its way into pay envelopes on July 1 , 1956 . The final 3 cents an hour will be granted on July 1 , 1957 . The contract will run through Dec. 31 , 1957 . Other contract provisions , as well as secondary costs resulting from the new wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package up a few more millions . However , nobody seemed to be worrying yesterday about costs . Mr. Quill went so rar as to sat . that the negotiations leading to the settlement " represented the first time in twenty years that the union has enjoyed genuine collective bargaining " with the agency operating the city 's transit system . Actually . observers were not sure just how much bargaining there had been . From ' the day the new authority took office on July 1 , replacing the old fiveman unpaid board , there appeared to be an air of certainty that a satisfactory deal could be worked out . In fact , those close to the matter were convinced that the main outlines of a settlement were worked out quickly . The only job left to be done was to get the union to agree to a considerable extension of the contract . The authority was hopino ? to have it run through June 30 , 1958 , but was willing to set tle for a pact that expired six months sooner . As usual Mr. Quill surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one such trapping , and the work stoppage scheduled for tomorrow  --  and now called off ? was another such device . Very few persons close to transit matters expected the stoppage to take place , The agreement represented for the union a major tactical victory . The T. W. U. had been vigorous in its efforts to get rid of the old authority , and yesterday it found that it paid to have a new one . When the union began last February to talk to the old authority about a wage rise under its contract reopener , it found itself backed into a corner with the agency refusing to budge beyond a 5.3-cent hourly increase . The old transit body insisted that it was bound to that figure by the decision of a fact-finding board . the previous spring . The union bided its time and waited for the new group to take over . The new agency indicated very early ' in its term that it would be willing to trade dollars for time , a technique that was skillfully worked out by Mr. Grady , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same offer yesterday to Division 1056 of the Amalgamated Street , Electric ' Railway and Motor Coach Employes , A. F , L. That union represented 1.500 workers in the Queens bus division , Union officials said they did not regard the agreement as entirely satisfactory , but they said they would present it to the membership next week .
