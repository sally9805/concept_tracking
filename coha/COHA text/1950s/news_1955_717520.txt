txt WASHINGTON , Dec. ** Defense Department 's new budget will exceed Secretary Charles E. Wilson 's economy goal by about $500,000,000 . This is the conclusion reached by high Pentagon officials who ' are in the final stages of preparing the Army , Navy and Air Force budgets for the 1957 fiscal year , which starts next July 1 . Moreover , if the economy drive fails in the remaining months of the present fiscal year , the extra costs may run close to $1,000 , - 000,000 . This would threaten the Administration 's effort to balance the national budget next year . Presumably , Mr. Wilson discussed the rising cost of national security in his conference with President Eisenhower at Gettysburg , Pa. , today . At a news conference on Oct. 18 , the Secretary announced a budget goal of $34,500,000,000 not only for the 1957 fiscal year but also for the present fiscal period , which ends next June 30 . The major factor hindering the economy drive . was said to be the industrial wage increases granted last summer , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials . A secondary factor is the higher cost of complex new weapons and equipment  --  the fruits of intensive research and development in the last five years . Officials Are Not Hopeful The Pentagon will strive to shave the new budget below $35,000,000,000 , but officials are not hopeful it can be done . They are sure they can not get down to $34,500,000,000 because each service has just about completed and justified its budget requests . One threat to the economy drive has materialized . Donald A. Quarles , Secretary of the Air Force , has convincgd Mr. Wilson that the Air Force can not reduce its civilian personnel by 6 per cent and continue its expansion to 137 wings . Consequently the Air Force has been exempted by Mr. Wilson from the civilian manpower cuts . But the Army and Navy Will be expected to make them . The manpower reduction also was anonunced on Oct. 18 , when Mr. Wilson said that he hoped to save about $500,000,000 chiefly by eliminating about 68,000 employee from the department 's payroll . The Air Force has 312,164 civilian employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . The increase has been denied , but it will not have to reduce its present force . Mr. Wilson scheduled the civilian manpower cuts as ' follows : 2 per cent by Dec. 31 , another 2 per cent by March 31 , and at least 2 per cent more by June 30 , 1956 . Although officials are disappointed with the higher estimates , they are heartened by the shape of things to come in 1957 . Some of those familiar with the budget say that it marks a historic departure from dependence on " conventional weapons . " Instead , the emphasis in all three services will be on new weapons and equipment , all along the line . Each of the services will put a lot of money into guided missiles . The Navy also will stress the most advanced ships and aircraft , including submarines and destroyers . The number of new // ships is said to be small , but they will have high capabilities . The Air Force , of course , will go ahead with its scheduled expansion from 121 to 131 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings . A wing varies in size from thirty to seventyfive planes , depending on the type and mission . ' What the country will get in the 1957 fiscal year budget , one , official said , is a big pay-off on ' ten years of post-war research . especially the intensive research and development since the Korean war . The actual appropriations for research and development , he added , do not tell the full story . Since 1950 , the specific appropriations have been at the rate of $1,210,000,000 to $1,500,000 , - 000 a year . He declared , however , that if one counted the money poured into experimental production of advanced weapons of all kinds , including guided missiles with and without atomic warheads , the figure probably would be $3,000,000,000 annually . So many advanced weapons , systems have been brought to the production stage , the official said , that in the next fiscal year the Defense Department will ite able to order more of them than in any previous year . A slash in procurement of conventional artillery ammunition was not confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as much ammunition stored underground as was consumed in winning World War II in Europe . Hence a general cutback was ordered . The Army is still unhappy at being forced to cut its military manpower to 1,027,000 men by next June 30 , a reduction from twenty divisions to eighteen or nineteen . However , Administration officials say the military establishment is in excellent shape to deal with a thirty-day atomic war or to build up conventional forces rapidly if a nonatomic conflict developed .
