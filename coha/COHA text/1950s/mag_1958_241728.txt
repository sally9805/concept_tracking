A flight of light planes hovered like hummingbirds over the green eastern jungle of Peru last week , dipping into tiny airstrips and steaming rivers to pick up waiting passengers , then heading back to a tin-roofed hangar by remote Lake Yarinacocha . They discharged their passengers , U.S. Protestant missionaries and their Indian assistants , darted back for more . One of the world 's most gallant little airlines thus brought together the 300 missionaries and workers of the Summer Institute of Linguistics to S.I.L . ' s yearly refresher course . <P> Flying missionaries is only one of the chores of the twelve U.S. pilots and six U.S. mechanics who operate the institute 's airline . Between missionary jobs , the line operates for a profit . It takes oilmen into the interior on charter , serves as a jungle feeder line for the Peruvian army 's air transport . Rates are moderate , but in a year the S.I.L . can gross some $35,000 from charters . It needs the money , for this airline consists mostly of planes it did not pay for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Andes . A dozen years ago the Summer Institute of Linguistics got the idea of flying its missionaries into Peru 's roadless interior , used a wartime Grumman Duck piloted by U.S. Missionary Pilot Betty Green . The case for taking to the air was overwhelmingly proved ; five hours of flying covered as much space as eight weeks of canoeing in crocodile-infested rivers past hostile Indians . Now S.I.L . operates twelve planes , well worn but carefully maintained , ranging from a Piper Super Cub ( one passenger ) to a Catalina ( 19 ) . Almost all were donated by individuals or religious groups . <P> The Lord 's Business . The pilots and mechanics also came as gifts . S.I.L . had no money to pay them ; so before joining the airline , each man had to get some church or individual to guarantee his salary ( $100 monthly at the most ) . Pilot George Insley , 35 , veteran of World War II bombing missions and five years in the Strategic Air Command ( he left as a major ) , is supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . pilots are not tempted by the fat rewards of business . " This is business , too , " says California-born Chief Pilot Omer Bondurant. 35 , a wartime night-fighter pilot , " the Lord 's business . The Lord wants us to do this work for him . " <P> Assisting the Lord is a thoroughly professional organization , superbly run on a shoestring by Bondurant and Maintenance Chief Lester Bancroft , 31 , a veteran of Continental Airlines . Planes are constantly monitored over war-surplus radio equipment , must report every 15 minutes , are required to stay down after dark . Each man packs a mosquito net , air mattress and survival rations , is reminded in case he runs out of food to " eat what monkeys eat . " " Fact is. " says Maintenance Boss Bancroft , " we never had a serious accident . We feel the Lord is with us. "
