When the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine was opened in 1893 , a high-school graduate could get right into medical college and expect to hang out his shingle in about four years . " The Hopkins , " as Baltimoreans call it , changed all that . It demanded a college degree , then four years of medical study . This basic plan , with some variations , has been adopted by virtually all U.S. medical schools . With at least a year 's internship added , it has come to mean at least nine , perhaps eleven years , between high school and the practice of medicine . <P> After vague rumblings of possible changes at Johns Hopkins , details of a radical new plan were reported last week . As soon as it can raise enough funds for additional faculty and necessary new buildings , the university proposes to : Admit students to the school of medicine after only two years of undergraduate work , during which time they need take no premedical courses except elementary biology and chemistry . In the first year of medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the humanities ) , the latter to be taken at the Johns Hopkins liberal arts campus . 1ntroduce anatomy ( now almost universally taught in first-year med courses ) in the second year , along with biochemistry , physiology and medical psychology . Required concurrently : anthropology and social psychology . The third year would be similar but more advanced ; at its end , students would get a B.A. Limit the fourth year to medicine , then add a fifth year , in which the student would simultaneously serve a rotating internship ( i.e. , switching from one type of hospital service to another ) . <P> After these seven crowded years - there would be 40 weeks in each academic year instead of the present 32 - additional internships or residencies , though desirable , would be optional . Upshot of the plan : after graduation from high school at the U.S. average age of 18 , the aspiring M.D. would be ready for practice at 25 , cutting two years from medical education .
