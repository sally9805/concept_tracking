It is late afternoon . The sun is sinking behind the trees of Rock Creek Park , and the audience is assembling in the amphitheater . There is a busy tittle-tattle and hum of people talking and moving about , and some vending of peanuts , popcorn and cold drinks . The big stage is bare , save for two permanent tree structures at the back and an arrangement of low platforms . Across the rear runs a long ground row of shrubbery which hides the horizontal line of the protective pipe railing . Beyond this ground row is the deep rich forest of the park , with the heavy limbs of white oaks and post oaks interlaced in luxuriant foliage , a mass of greenery , reared up between the audience and the western sky . The orchestra files into a pit , and a tuning and testing of strings , woodwinds and brasses begin . Then the conductor appears . The orchestra strikes up a short and powerfully chorded overture which builds into a zestful determination . The overture ends and there is an instant pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington 's Health " . Our chorus as citizens begins entering from the two side stages and going down toward the center stage . There are soon other citizens accompanying them . They are all singing with the orchestra . While they converge toward the center , other people are coming in from the right and left in holiday mood . Amos Sullivan , a stringy and energetic man of some thirty years , is acting as master of ceremonies .

( The crowd parts now , and Washington and Martha move up the platform to stage right . The men bow , and the women curtsey . Washington is a tall young man of twenty-seven , muscular and of frank open bearing , though somewhat stiff and even embarrassed in his manner and speech . His face is broad and honest and florid from the burning of the sun and exposure to wind and weather . And his big hands , which seem fitted for swinging a mattock or an axe , for lifting boulders and rolling logs , rather than swinging a gentleman 's cane , hang somewhat awkwardly at his side . He is dressed in the height of fashion . Martha is a small demure woman , dark-eyed and attractive . Her manner is gracious , kindly and smiling , and she gives one the impression of cultured aplomb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but unlike him , there is no hint of embarrassment or awkwardness in her manner .

WASHINGTON ( Chuckling . ) ( The people laugh . ) Welcome Chief Running Deer ! ( He strides over , and he and the chief greet each other warmly . They place their hands on each other 's shoulders and go through the Indian howdy formula . Then they embrace each other . The medicine man runs about the scene shaking his gourd rattle at the people in mimic ceremony . Washington calls over to Martha . ) Our friend and ally from the Ohio country , Martha .

Lover in the ring ! ( Washington and Martha look about them . A young serving girl takes Martha 's bonnet and wrap and Billy Lee steps forward to take Washington 's hat and great coat . They bear them off . The dark-eyed girl leads the singing game , Martha and Cynthy Ann and the older people join in until they are all marching about the two men . The Indians stand in their places but lift their feet an inch or two up and down and sway their shoulders in rhythm to the old song .

The singing goes on , and the slaves at the back begin moving rhythmically about . ) Go choose your east , go choose your west , Choose the one that you love best .

The medicine man looks about him and then darts out at the rear . The remainder of the young people go dancing and twirling away . The violins in the orchestra repeat the dance tune in fortissimo gaiety as they go out . And then as the scene is deserted , save for Washington and Martha , the music changes into an appealing old love air  --  " Come , Phyllis , Come Into These Bowers " by Thomas Ford  --  and continues softly . The two stand looking after the people off at the right , where the sounds of merriment are dying away . Washington 's arm goes out and around Martha as they stand side by side .

( Lucy , Westmoreland , and the servants wave goodby as the scene fades out. ) p. 62 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE VI Washington 's camp at Valley Forge . Upstage near the center there 's a soldiers hut , and at the right rear , two or three trees marking the beginning of a forrest . Over to the left rear we glimpse a hill . It is bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little shack . Snow is on the roof , icicles hanging down , and the snow among the trees , glistening cold in the light . Several ragged , half-frozen soldiers are moving restlessly back and forth in the scene , their feet tied up in pieces of toe acking and quilting . Seated on a bench and leaning against the wall of the little hut are two other soldiers , bowed under a ragged blanket . They are propped against each other for whatever warmth they can get . A single sentry stands at the right with his gun . The wind whistles , the decrepit figures continue to move . At the left rear a woman is heard sobbing now and then , and off at the left front the sound of knocking . FIRST SOLDIER One , two , three , four . ( He counts in time to the music of the unseen chorus , which has begun humming . ) Hup , hup hup hup . ( In a sudden loud yell . Calling piteously . ) Hey ! Hey ! ( He stands as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Hey ! Hey ! p. 63 FIRST SOLDIER ( Screaming . ) We 're dying here ! ( The chorus dies out period . ) GUARD Quiet ! FIRST SOLDIER ( Calling out . ) Quiet yourself , you Pennsylvania beef . GUARD Complain , complain , that't all you New Yorkers do . You think nobody else fights this war but you . SECOND SOLDIER Shut up . Connecticut does all the bleeding for liberty . THIRD SOLDIER I 'm from Carolina . And I never expect to live to get back there . FOURTH SOLDIER Oh ! How have ye lived so long . Certain it seemed you 'd be shot at the battle of Princeton  --  in the back . THIRD SOLDIER By heaven ! ( He turns , as if to attack the fourth soldier .

( He laughs queerly , shakes his shoulders and goes on walking his post . The wind whistles , the men shiver and pull their thin coats tighter about their shoulders . ) ( Sound effect . ) SECOND SOLDIER ( Young Lawrence Sullivan enters from the right accompanied by a small detail of soldiers . He is now an Ensign . This detail is in pitiful condition also , but tries to perform its duties . ) LAWRENCE ( To the weaving , freezing soldiers . ) You men must keep in your huts .

Two or three men come over and lift the half-frozen , half , conscious forms and help them off toward the right rear . The sound of the sobbing woman is heard again . Lawrence is standing straight and still in the scene , his back towards the hut . He is trying to master his emotions . ) GUARD It 's your brother George that 's dead in there , ai n't it ? LAWRENCE Yes . ( He stands still a moment . The wind whistles . Lawrence lifts his head . ) All right , men  --  inside . SECOND SOLDIER And why ? LAWRENCE You need your  --  rest  --  sleep . FIRST SOLDIER ( Bitterly ) How can they rest . SECOND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost this war . We have . LAWRENCE ( Vehemently . ) No ! When spring comes , things will be better . THIRD SOLDIER ( Satirically . ) Ho , ho . We never expect to see the spring . p. 66 FOURTH SOLDIER It 's hopeless . Where we 've got one man , the British have ten . FIRST SOLDIER ( Angrily . ) It 's that almighty General of ours that 's took away our belief , our hope . He has brought us here to starve , to die . ( Gesturing off with his shaking hand . ) ( Sinks to floor . ) ( Washington enters from left , slowly , and stops . His head is bent down in deep thought , his hands clasped behind him . His form is encased in a huge great coat , the collar of which comes up high behind his neck . For a moment he is unobserved . ) LAWRENCE ( Angrily . ) Your name is Whitaker . I shall have to report you for disobedience . Stand up . ( Whitaker does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . ( Shaking his head . ) Benedict Arnold was the man we should have followed .

( Lawrence looks up and sees Washington. ) p. 67 LAWRENCE ( Calling out . ) Attention ! ( The guard looks out and presents arms . Washington comes on into the scene . The men straighten up as best they can . The First Soldier gazes at Washington in fear . ) WASHINGTON ( Kindly . ) Nevermind , my lad . ( He touches his forehead . ) You 're ill . He has a fever . ( He gestures to the guard who comes over . ) Take him to his bed . ( The guard salutes and helps the soldier away toward the left front . At a gesture from Lawrence one of the detail mounts guard by the hut . The others help the men on out at the left front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LAWRENCE ( Contritely . ) I 'm sorry you heard what they said , sir . WASHINGTON If only Congress could see this . And by heaven they shall . I 'll bring them here to look with their own eyes at what these men endure . ( Amos Sullivan comes out from behind the shack . He is walking with the aid of a crutch , and is pretty badly grizzled and woebegone . ) AMOS SULLIVAN ( Saluting . ) They 're about ready to start , sir . And I come to tell you for the last time that I 'm staying here with you . p. 68 WASHINGTON ( Firmly . ) No , Amos . You 've done your part . AMOS SULLIVAN But what about you ? You 've more than done your part and you ai n't quitting . WASHINGTON But you 've been wounded . AMOS SULLIVAN I 'm still worth any two of them Lobsterbacks .

( CHUCKLING . ) Take care or the men will start eating that mule out there  --  bones and all . ( Amos looks at him , his lips quivering with emotion , the tears running down his bearded face . He stands there before Washington crying . Washington puts his arms around him , and Amos hugs him . ) AMOS SULLIVAN Twenty-five years we 've been pulling together through thick and thin . Now it 's ended . ( Brokenly . ) I 'll be praying for you at Mt . Vernon  --  every night . And God wo n't let you fail , God wo n't let it happen , sir . ( He turns and goes back the way he came . Washington looks at Lawrence . Lawrence salutes , Washington returns the salute and moves slowly back upstage to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left after his detail . A lone male voice in the chorus begins singing " The Lord is My Light and My Salvation . " He is soon joined by the other members . Washington stretches his hands in anguish . He twists his head , stares out in front of him . The chorus come out a little more strongly . He lifts his head to heaven , as if pleading for Divine guidance in this dark hour . He then moves upon the platform at the upper right and sinks down on his knees , his face lifted , the tears staining his cheeks . From the darkness now the chorus chants more vibrantly the rest of the words . Billy Lee comes in at left carrying a heavy blanket over his arm . He is evidently in search of his master . He sees Washington . He takes off his hat and kneels down . The chorus concludes with it sonorous " Amen . " From up left , four soldiers bring in the coffin of George Sullivan followed by Cynthy Ann , Amos , Martha , Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstage from the hill . The little funeral procession comes up to Washington and stops. ) p. 69 CYNTHY ANN We made it soft and easy for him , sir , as we can . We put a lot of straw under him and around him so he wo n't bump about . And he looks so sweet and peaceful-like there . he is our firstborn , sir , and we named him after you , and he 's died for his country and I  --  he 's died for his country . ( She stuffs her handkerchief against her mouth , her other hand holding a little prayer book . Washington has taken off his hat . ) AMOS SULLIVAN Please , sir , she wants you to read a few words over him . ( Cynthy Ann hands him the little book opened . Washington takes it and begins to read  --  leading the procession on . ) WASHINGTON Thou knowest , Lord , the secrets of our hearts .

( The procession passes out at the right front . The music continues for awhile , and then , far off at the left , the sound of cheering is heard . It grows louder . A young American officer comes walking rapidly in from the right rear . This is Alexander Hamilton . He is a Lieutenant-Colonel , a dashing young fellow about twenty-three years old . The sentinel rushes over to the left and looks out. ) p. 70 HAMILTON ( To the sentinel . ) What is that ? GUARD Shall we sound an alarm , Colonel Hamilton ? ( Hamilton strides over to the left and stands by him . The cheering comes on in closer , and now entering at the left front comes young General Lafayette . He is accompanied by his aide carrying the French flag and is surrounded by a group of ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , salutes and shakes his hand . ) HAMILTON General La Fayette !

( Hamilton runs over to the right to go after Washington , when he re-enters hurriedly . He stops and then hurries forward . Lafayette flies into his arms and gives him a smacking kiss on each cheek . Washington embraces him . ) WASHINGTON By heavens , sir ! Welcome  --  welcome back to service ! LAFAYETTE Certainement  --  Welcome home ! And here I bring you great news ! ( He pulls a document from his coat and hands it to Washington . Washington opens it with trembling hands and looks at it . His face works with emotion. ) p. 71 WASHINGTON ( With a great happy cry . ) Thank God !

After the overture the orchestra breaks into Yankee Doodle and at the proper time , the lights come up in a broad flare on the center stage . Here the Yankee Doodle dance has formed . For an eye-blink there is a tableau of waitingness and then the dance comes to immediate and flamboyant life . Lafayette is in the center of things . Westmoreland is dancing with Lucy . Lawrence Sullivan cuts in on him , gets Lucy to himself . Amos and Cynthy Ann are present . Amos leaning on his stick , much aged . He is upset at Lawrence 's boldness . A number of colored field hands also are present . We see Billy Lee and his coquettish Hannah . BILLY ( Letting out a loud call . ) " Enjoy yourself folks , the war 's over .

( A reverberating thunder of ominous guns sounds in the drums of the orchestra , and the light fades out. ) p. 118 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE 5 ( The thunder continues an instant and then dies . From the darkness comes a great raucous cry of many voices in distinct and angry unison . ) VOICES Down with Washington ! ( Other voices repeat the cry from different directions .

There another group of insurgents are dancing out their fierce antagonism against the power of the law . The words are huskily repeated . The light dies . Once more the voices speak high and clear from the darkness ) . Down with the dictator ! Down with Tyranny ! Dictator ! Tyranny ! Tyranny ! Dictator !

The dancers form into a spearhead of attack and rush to the right to meet the enemy sound which is now filling the night with its implacable and advancing strength . The insurgents are hurled back . They form and advance again , but are struck by an avalanche of strength in the demonic sound that is reaching a fortissimo . At its peak , upon the scrim up center stage is flashed an angry red light which casts shadows of marching soldiers as they advance on the rebels . The shadows increase to tremendous size on the scrim as the soldiers pause at the edge of the platform above the rebels . The rebels go down in serried falling rows before them .

The figure of Washington emerges aloof and lonely on the left platform where he is picked up by a spotlight . He is muffled in a great cloak and carries a gleaming sword upraised in his right hand . He comes down along the platform and stands before the soldiers . From the shadows the voices speak again , chastened , abject , obedient. ) p. 119 VOICES ( From many directions  --  a cappella ) VOICES ( Cont . ) We yield up our arms in obedience to the supreme law of the land .

Immediately upon the exit of the parade , the lights come up full on the center stage . Washington as the Grand Master leads in several other gentlemen dressed in Masonic regalia and they take positions for the Laying of the Corner Stone . Then from right , left , and up center come lines of marching people , all carrying flags .

( The scene blacks out . The Capitol dome is projected on the scrim . The orchestra builds up to a terrific finale of brass and drums . While this is happening the actors have formed themselves on the stage for curtain call . A platform is run on center stage behind the ramp .
