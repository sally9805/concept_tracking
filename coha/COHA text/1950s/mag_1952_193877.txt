One cloudy morning in August 1945 , the B-29 Great Artiste , commanded by Major Charles W. Sweeney of North Quincy , Mass. , was flying over Japan . After 50 minutes ' unsuccessful search for his target , Major Sweeney asked a naval ordnance observer , Commander Frederick L. Ashworth of Wenham , Mass. , what he should do . Try Nagasaki , said Commander Ashworth . With just enough fuel left for a single bomb run , the navigator , Captain James F. Van Pelt Jr . of Oak Hill , W. Va. , hit Nagasaki exactly " on the nose . " The bombardier , Captain Kermit K. Beaham of Houston , saw a hole in the clouds , let fly . <P> The atom bomb which fell from the Great Artiste at exactly 11:03 a.m. was far more powerful than that which had fallen on Hiroshima three days previously . Looking down on Nagasaki , Sergeant Raymond C. Gallagher of Chicago , wearing welder 's goggles to protect his eyes , saw three " shock circles " rising through the boiling-up column of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , including the Mitsubishi steel plant , had been destroyed . Engulfed in the explosion were 252,000 people , 36,000 of whom died , and 40,000 of whom were seriously injured . <P> At 11 a.m. last Saturday , Aug. 9 , the air-raid sirens wailed again in Nagasaki . In memory of the atom-bomb dead , Nagasaki citizens bowed their heads , closed their eyes , prayed . Temple bells rang , civic leaders spoke . That night thousands of small lanterns , each with a candle burning in it , floated down the river which runs through the center of Nagasaki . In Buddhist faith , each candle consoled a soul lost in the atom blast .
