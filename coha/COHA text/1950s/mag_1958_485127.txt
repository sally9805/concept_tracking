THEY WERE years of suffering : he who had been free and footloose was confined " in a small cell which has free space eight feet long and one foot ten inches wide . " A bell rang for morning waking , breakfast and room cleaning . A whistle piped work : first Vanzetti worked in the prison shop , painting auto licenses , and then ? when the paint fumes made him ill  --  as a tailor . A whistle piped lunch and the noon counting by the guards . Then back to his cell . A bell rang for afternoon work , a late afternoon whistle for " talking , playing , and joking " in the prison yard . A bell for supper , then hack to the cell , and a final ring for lights out . Vanzetti wrote of feeling " buried " and " squashed " and " crushed " and December 27 , 195S " tired , tired , tired , " and becoming a " shadow " of a man . He longingly " looked at the sky and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . Halfway through his imprisonment , he let himself go in a prose poem on nature : 0 the blessing green of the wilderness and of the open land ? 0 the blue vastness of the oceans ? the fragrances of the flowers and the sweetness of the fruits ? the sky reflecting lakes ? the singing torrents ? the telling brooks ? 0 the valleys , the hills ? the awful Alps ! O the mistic dawn ? the roses of the aurora , the glory of the moon ? O the sunset ? the twilight ? 0 the supreme extasies and mystery of the starry night , heavenly creature of the eternity . Yes , Yes , all this is real actuallity but not to us he and Sacco , not to us chained ? and just and simply because we , being chained , have not the freedom to use our natural faculty of locomotion to carry us from our cells to the open horizon ? under the sun at daytime ? under the risible stirs at night . Paying this price , in these six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirties  --  when he was thirty-three , he noted that it was the age of Christ ? he changed from an uncreative person to a creative one . Several things contributed to this . First were changes in Vanzetti 's unconscious . The creative process is little understood , but an unconscious guilt is known to relate actively to it ; in some conditions it acts as a stimulus ; in others , as an inhibitor . If Vanzetti had been inhibited because of an unconscious guilt feeling that he had killed his mother , and if he were now suffering for a crime he had not committed , then his prison ordeal would assuage his guilt and liberate creative mental energy . Parenthetically , one might add that his entire behavior in prison was more that of an innocent than guilty person , although the evidence is not conclusive . Another factor in his burgeoning : Vanzetti found he had a public . In capturing and holding spontaneous , unorganized public interest in Europe and America , the Sacco and Vanzetti case was without precedent . As early as 1921 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us by the people of the world , the laborers ( I mean the workers ) and the greatest minds and hearts proves beyond any possible doubt that a new conception of Justice is planning its way in the soul of mankind : a justice centered on man as man . For as I have already said , you , they are doing for us what once could only have been done for saints and kings . This is real progress . Having " the people of the world " as an audience was a stimulus possessed by few . Through the prison years there were friendly visitors and correspondents : Aldino Felicani and Italian comrades aided him in the Plymouth defense ; afterward , during the Dedham trial , came Americans  --  the first Vanzetti had really gotten to know in his thirteen American years . Among them were Communists , anarchists , Socialists and liberals of variegated hue . A group of women came to occupy a prominent place among his visitors , the most important being Mrs. Elizabeth Glendower Evans , Mrs. Jessica Henderson , Mrs. Gertrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Cerise Jack and Miss Alice Blackwell . These women had certain attributes in common : They were in their sixties and seventies , mostly married and the mothers of families , wealthy , cultured , socially prominent , liberal ; many had worked in reform movements , acquiring hard , practical experience . Between Vanzetti and these American mothers there developed over the years feelings of trust , affection  --  and love . To Vanzetti they were maternal surrogates  --  replacing nature  --  people who really cared for him and with whom he could do what he had never really done in his life : share his feelings . To the American mothers , Vanzetti was an exciting cause ce1H , re and an attractive personality with a potential for growth which they were helping to realize . THE final factor in Vanzetti 's burgeoning : Charlestown 's confinement gave him the board , room and leisure which he had previously failed to achieve He put on twenty pounds ; the prison regimen left him Sundays and evening rest periods free ; Warden Hendry and the prison staff treat-492 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors and his sending of mail . Vanzetti 's burgeoning began formally with a letter he wrote to Mrs. Elizabeth Evans in July , 1921 . " I was just thinking what I would do for pass the long days jail ; I was saying to myself ; do some work . But what ? Write . A gentle motherly figure came to my mind and I rehear the voice . " Mrs. Evans ' voice , Vanzetti tells us , said two things . First , " Now you advise me to study . Yes , it would be a good thing . But I do not know enough this language to be able to make any study through it . I will like to read Longfellow 's , Paine 's , Franklin 's , and Jefferson 's works , but I can not . I would like to study mathematics , physics , history , and science , but I have not a sufficient elementary school to begin such studies . . . . " IN THE ensuing years , feeling the " fever of knowledge , " Vanzetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations of his elementary-school education ; English hooks , with the added handicap of learning a new language . His friends encouraged him , sent him books . Over several years , Mrs. Virginia MacMechan , a young school teacher , gave him English lessons in the Charlestown visitors ' room , and corrected his English compositions . To her he described how he read a book : " From the beginning to the end , first to acquire a general criterion ... the best and the worse remain fixed in my mind . After I repass and study the more important of these two things  --  minutely dissecting and analyzing them . The same I do in respect of their ethic and technical points , drinking merely from the first , squeezing all the good from the second . I am ferocious , implacable , and good-hearted even with hooks . " Sometimes  --  he humorously told Mrs. Evans  --  he read standing on his feet and leaning " like an elephant " against his cell wall . He progressed and by 1923 was reading Robinson 's Mind in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American writings came to include the Survey Graphic , the New Republic , The Nation , and books by Jack London , Sinclair Lewis and Upton Sinclair . The second thing the voice of Mrs. Evans told him was , " Why do n't you write something now ? It will be useful to you when you will be free . " Early in prison , Vanzetti began a bilingual , variegated literary production . In Italian , he wrote articles for anarchist newspapers and a novelette , Events and Victims , recounting his experiences in a munitions factory before America entered the war . Written in Italian and then translated into English were articles for the Defense Committee Bulletin ; his pamphlet-autobiography , The Story of a Proletarian Life ; and a pamphlet , Background of the Plymouth Trial . The English writings were a translation of Pierre J. Proudhon 's War and Peace , a book which had become his political Bible ; and , creating the deepest , most rounded picture of him , his letters to American friends . There are probably no other letters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vanzetti 's English vocabulary grows richer , but the misspelling of both common and esoteric words does not seem to improve much , and the grammar remains awkward . The ideas proliferate and in December , 1926 , Vanzetti wrote that while his understanding was increasing , his powers of expression seemed to be diminishing . THE letters are political , polemical . To a woman correspondent , he writes : " I am a bitter polemist , a merciless theorist , and I know to cause others much anguish . . . . The words that I am writing will disturb you , will cause your heart to ache , but would you prefer my insincerity to my sincerity ? " In another letter , he notes that only now , in prison , has he reached " sureness of thought . " He is the anarchist  --  equally against all state institutions , Russian Communists , Italian Fascists and American democratic capitalists , and oblivious to American democratic processes and Constitutional reforms . He is also the political student , shunning humbug and the unexamined , marshaling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his small The NATION and crowded cell he has fastened a map of the world ; and from this barred hole , he limns the socio-political profiles of different countries . In 1926 , when most people were either for or against , he tries to understand Russia : In Russia , this happened ? the Czarism was destroyed by a revolution ; part of the owners were expropriated ; a party took the power , stopped the continuation of expropriation and appropriated to itself that part of the social wealth which had already been expropriated by the people From that moment the revolution began its regression and few leaders of a small party became the only and real rulers of Russia They were immediately compelled to form a national army , and build a policy worse than the Czars ' one , to uphold a new church , not better than the old one ; and , given the conditions , to be more reactionary and tyrannic than the dethroned autocracy itself . A penetrating social satire on an American institution of the 1920s is a letter in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International and comments on its tawdry " art , " photos of nudes ; its inane ads which promise knowledge on purchase of a Nelson 's Encyclopedia , wisdom on sending a donation to Lionel Pelman , and strength on sending another donation to a naked " fortism " strong man . An article in the issue ascribes the death of American Presidents to overwork and the pressure of office-seekers , but omits what to Vanzetti is the main reason ? the Presidents ' " vain efforts to save an unjust social order in decomposition . " To Vanzetti , the title of another article , " Nationwide Conspiracy of the Ku Klux Klan , " " sounds like a sneeze . " His insight is charged with a mounting , rhapsodical sort of sad-ness as , over these six years , he writes of Italy . The triumph of fascism " has revealed . . . the moral loneness in which we have fallen after the war and the revolutionary over-excitation of the last few years . " In 1924 , on reading of the killing of Matteoti , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . the began again great and noisy choreography  --  sing Red Flag  --  made big talk  --  and be beaten again . " One December 27 , 1958 hundred thousand workers " ran away like rabbits " before one thousand Fascists whom they could have eliminated in a few hours . " They the workers sing Red Flag and fail daily under the Fascists ' dagger . Then the murderers get the prize  --  the victims the grave  --  their relatives in prison . And again : great funerals , great talks , great runaway  --  and great noise of red flags falling in the mud of blood and shame . " It is this awful unconsciousness of the people and the work of their leaders . . . who only look for power ? that have permitted-caused the fascism and all its horrors . " Fascist rule is " blood , crimes , degeneration , " but in the future Vanzetti sees a possible " liberation , reached through a terrific lavacrus of blood , through aspiration , heroic sacrifice and fire " ? almost a prophecy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of mankind runs through the letters . In 1923 , he writes : " The dearest manifestation of the universe for me is mankind , with its miseries and proudness , its glories and its shames , its smallness and its grandeur . " And in 1924 : Oh , how right we anarchists are in our postulates , criterions , critics , and fights Mankind want not , can not understand us . It is too villain , too tartufe , too traviated , too coward . We climb our Calvary under our cross  --  but indeed , the madness , the ignominious tragedy of our crucifiers , peoples and tyrants , made us laugh at our worst moment but it 's terrible and stupid immensity We go to hell , but with many in company . We witnessing the end of a world , but with Christ and Socrates for teachers . And this in 1927 : Very often I turn around my eyes to see , contemplate and study the world even and mankind . The spectacle is extremely repugnant and heart-tearing . At it , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if to sympathize , or if to despise humanity . . . . Things are going from bad to worse . War in China , Nicaragua , revolution in Java , Mexico , Brazil ; the Baltics on foot of war ; France and Italy mobilizing , one against the other ; England , U S , France , and Japan in a crazy rivalry of armament ; South America and U.S. in danger of war ; Italy under the Fascist dictatorship , Russia under the Bolshevik one , scandals , corruption , crimes , diseases , degeneration , greed , hatred , unconsciousness , prejudices and insanity sweeping the earth . I wonder how it will end . In learning English , Vanzetti was not only learning to think , but ? in the manner of a patient talking to a psychiatrist ? learning to put his feelings into words ; making unconscious and repressed feelings conscious . His earliest Villafalletto memories were of a passive , maternal nature and an active , masculine nature . Gradually , writing of the passive-active dichotomy in nature and politics , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole life had been a passive bowing to events ; as he came to recognize this passivity , he disliked it , yet was unable to change it . The only thing he could do was to write grandiose , flamboyant , violent fantasies . But the more he wrote such fantasies , the less he could actually commit violent acts , and the more he disliked his passive role . He describes this passive-violent conflict , and the supremacy of the first , in a letter written in July , 1923 , on the day following the electrocution of a fellow prisoner named Pappas : I was tired , disgusted , and furibond . Many time , during the last three hours , I was tempted to smash my door , to began a revolt . But I am almost civilized  --  quasi coward  --  and still stay serene as our ancient wisdom , Christianism , and modern sciences command . Then next morning I knocked at the souls of my comrades in chains , " Well , " said I , and look in their eyes ? " what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hate my tongue With one alone I said- " We can do all that is humanly possible Just to know and to will and we would have been able to save Pappas , were not us cowards " This feeling of " furibond " then became one of the lineaments of a psychosis . IN OCTOBER , 1924 , Vanzetti complained of symptoms characteristic of the onset of many psychoses . He felt a sensation of electricity in the air and an unexplainable feeling of 493 " something funny " in his head and chest which he felt presaged an earthquake . The following month he wrote : My native me is dreary for what it is becoming I have cut down trees with a sense of sympathy for them , and almost a sense of remorse ; while now thinking of my axe a lust seizes me to get a mad delight and exaltation by using them on the necks and trunks of the men eaters ; on the necks of those who seem to have evil in their head , and on the trunks of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Dr. Joseph McLoughlin , Charlestown 's physician , and Dr. Charles Sullivan , Massachusetts state expert for insane criminals , relates what happened in December . Vanzetti became disturbed in his cell and on December 8 , was transferred to another cell , where every night he barricaded the door with a table , saying men might overpower his guards and kill him . On the morning of December 24 , in the prison workshop , he became abusive and threatening to another prisoner whom he claimed was laughing at him . On the night of December 30 , in " some sort of frenzied attack , " he smashed a chair to pieces in his cell room . Before and after this he was seen by Dr. McLoughlin and Dr. Sullivan . He told them that he had been forsaken by everyone ; that " perjurers " at his trial , " fascists " and " others " were " out to get him , " and for " self-protection " he needed to carry a gun . When the doctors asked why he broke the chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan diagnosed him an " insane " and " dangerous person " in a " hallucinatory and delusional state of mind " and recommended his committal to Bridgewater Hospital for the Criminally Insane . On January 2 , 1925 , manacled and guarded by police officers , he arrived at Bridgewater . When the admitting doctor asked him what brought him to a mental hospital , he replied , " I do n't know , I am not crazy . Perhaps they think I need a rest . " For the next two months he was controlled , polite , a " model prisoner . " In February , during three interviews with Bridgewater doctors , 494 he elaborated his fear of an Italian Fascist plot against him . Vanzetti pointed out that in the past two or three years the Fascists in Italy had killed 10,000 political opponents . " I have never read of any political party that is as violent as this one . They are criminals in every branch of criminality . " Although the Italian Fascist press was supporting Sacco and Vanzetti as Italians , Vanzetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanzetti , was " a brick on the chest of Mussolini , and the best way that he can do now is to send the people to the cemetery . I would be among them . " Since 1921 , the number of Fascists among Charlestown 's Italian inmates had grown ; among them were men whom Vanzetti was " positive " could kill him " any time any day that they want to . " In Bridgewater , too , there were Fascists : " I feel it . No , I more than feel it . " Somewhere in Bridgewater was an Italian , presumably a Fascist , who had killed three men outside prison , then stabbed to death with a shoemaker 's knife another prisoner ; but Vanzetti refused to reveal his name , saying that even when it came to Fascists he was no stool pigeon . Today we do not know whether there was a Fascist plot or not . Neither did the Bridgewater doctors ; they could only evaluate Vanzetti 's story as possessing " a somewhat paranoid coloring . " On February 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in a chair pretending to have his eyes closed , but watching the other prisoners . At dinner that night , he looked at his food suspiciously , then took potatoes from another prisoner 's plate and ate them , saying nothing . HERE the Bridgewater records stop ; the remaining Bridgewater story , gleaned only from Vanzetti 's letters , is confusing and incomplete . On April 6 , Vanzetti writes : " Something is gradually dying in me , and what remains is just all right . I 'm beginning to believe the Bible . ' The tyrants should be stabbed . ' " And he noted a return of his original body sensations . " As for me , I have suffered the last few days a terrible heartburn , and I have said , and maybe I may have , or I may not have , ulcers in my stomach . If I have ulcers , it is all right , though I will fight against . If I have no ulcers , it is still better . " On April 10 , " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each second , and he whom the Gods have not yet wholly deprived of understanding , far from being surprised , should indeed wonder if it were not so , for man is today his own greater enemy , and the slaves are , more than the powerful , the slave-keepers of themselves . " He quotes Anatole France 's Penguin Island , which he has just been reading : " After having destroyed the present curse called civilization , the people returned to a certain primitiveness through which they gradually build and return to the present state . " WHEN A new Italian patient was brought to Bridgewater , the authorities , evidently fearing a disturbance , moved Vanzetti to a new ward and restricted his movements . Vanzetti was bitter : in a letter to Miss Blackwell , written in pencil on a torn scrap of brown , grocery-bag paper , he says : " I have already experienced that in the name of psychopathy ' may be committed the same , if not more cruelty , injustice , and partiality , as in the name of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . " Then , on April 17 , Vanzetti reports that the bodily sensations which had begun his illness were abating . After this , he proceeded to get well and on May 11 writes : " Yes , my heartburn is gone , and I am quite well , so well that I feel to write a treatise on sociology , which I have not yet begun , because I wish to hear some friends in its regard . " Glancing back at his illness , he describes his penchant for violence : " Death for death , I think that the times require to bring with us some enemies , some blackguards ? I should say the more that is possible . It is my reason , not my heart , that is speaking so I think I do not feel so now , but sometimes . I still abhor the blood now , as always before . " The NATION Despite his violent words , his most violent deed was to break a chair in his cell at Charlestown . Vanzetti 's earlier feeling of being " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in people . On June 20 , he wrote to Irene Benton , one of his elderly American " mothers " : " To have your friendship , to know to be a friend of you ? is dear , very dear to me . The spirit of your words reach and thrills the innermost sources of my life . You are great in goodness , comrade Irene , generous as the vital elements . . . . " One may speculate on the psychiatric dynamics of Vanzetti 's madness . His main symptom was a fear of being attacked by men and a wish to attack men . Such a symptom is frequently due to an insufficiently repressed erotic desire for another man . Of Vanzetti 's erotic life we know only that before prison he mentions no woman , and while in prison his relations with them could only be platonic . Before prison his relations with men were transitory , suggesting that he avoided prolonged contact . In prison , for the first time , he had to live for years with the same men . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow convicts and no Charlestown inmate has written of Vanzetti . But the experience may have caused previously repressed erotic desires toward men to break into consciousness ? so unbearably as to throw Vanzetti into a psychosis . This speculation does not explain why it took Vanzetti three years to become psychotic , why his psychosis lasted only six months , and why and how he then came out of it . On May 28 , 1925 , with the Bridgewater doctors certifying him not insane , Vanzetti was returned to Charlestown . Confined in a more capacious cell , he found that the authorities in Bridgewater had lost many of his books . Most missed was a copy of the Divine Comedy given him by a " far away comrade and friend , " which he had had expensively hound and which he had carried with him during his free toiling years . Dante , too , had experienced the " dark wood " of his own madness , and come out of it . Since the fall of 1924 , William G. Thompson had become chief lawyer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New England scion who , the year Vanzetti was born , had graduated with honors from Harvard and had then become a very busy and distinguished Boston lawyer ; he was a conservative , a believer in the capitalistic system and in the church as an institution . He also believed in fair play and noblesse oblige , and it was this last which brought him into the Sacco and Vanzetti case . After two and a half years ' association with Vanzetti , he said : If Vanzetti had an education he would have been a professor in Harvard College . He is one of the most gifted men that I know of . I have heard him give a most enlightening talk on Ralph Waldo Emerson , he has discussed Shelley 's poems with me , and I have heard him use words that I have had to go home to look for in the Century Dictionary to find the meaning of . He is a dreamer , and an idealist . . . ? The Harvard graduate , the man of old American traditions , the established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his soul is there to be found the faith , the splendid gentility , which make the man , Bartolomeo Vanzetti . On the side of Vanzetti there was admiration for Thompson 's skillful defense and an intimate thanks : " Of what you are doing for us , Mr. Thompson , I am not only grateful and thankful for myself alone , but for my old father , for my brother , my sisters , for all those who I love and am loved . " And : " I hope to understand a little the brave , learned , beautiful fight that you are fighting in our behalf , paying of it in peace , rest , interest , and other universally desired things . " Vanzetti did come to understand much of Thompson 's " fight , " so different from his own fight of the classes . Of all the Americans , it was probably Thompson who most enriched Vanzetti 's mind ? and trammeled his violent part . Through 1926 , Thompson argued two motions for a new trial before the Massachusetts Supreme Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public in Europe and America . Vanzetti felt new hope : " .. . Denial of a new trial , after the work of Mr. Thompson , would be . . . a dangerous answer to the conscience of the world . It could change the proletarian Jobs into a Sampson , the proletarian rabbit into a lion . There would be flames . . . Nor I believe the five men the State Supreme Court Justices capable of such monstrosity . " Previously , Vanzetti had written on matters not directly connected with the trial ; now , describing his mind as a " hurricane of thoughts , feelings , and sentiments , " he concentrated on conferring with members of the defense , translating Thompson 's briefs into Italian for distribution in Europe , and putting " blood " into his own appeal for a new trial . He saw himself in the perspective of the lugubrious past of mankind : Were not the first Christians believed to be blood drinkers ? Yes , they were believed so , and were insulted , tortured , martyrized by the ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair deal and acquittal those not only innocent first Christians could have had , in being tried by pagans to whom the fact of one being Christian was all the crimes and all the guilts at once and in one ? From those times , I could come down through the centuries showing you that the same dealings has been imposed by the golden and the ragged mobs to all those who have discovered , wished , and labored for a little more of truth , justice , freedom , triumph and sublimination of the men , women , and of the life  --  down , down to this very date . . Reading of the persecutions of w itches in the sixteenth century , he came across the name of a French attorney , Bartholomeo ( " I am proud of it " ) who had defended rodents and insects accused of being witches . " It seems that these insects and rats have been more lucky than me .... " E Nlassachusetts Supreme Court denied both motions for a new trial ; the world was quiet . Vanzetti wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Dos Passos , who visited him in Charlestown December , 1926 , after the last denial , wrote : " Van- tti sits on the bench , thick-chested and calm . . . . He has a look of broad-browed calm about him . His lips do n't tremble when he smiles under his thick mustache . But it is the calm of a man with his back to the wall . He too glances from time to time over his shoulders , as if to make sure that there is nobody creeping up behind him . " Vanzetti described his prison life at this time ( he was working in the shop , making auto licenses ) : " Before , I could work nine hours , eleven hours a day , and then sit down and write . It poured out straight from the heart . Often I would not have a single correction in an article . But now , word by word , it is so difficult
