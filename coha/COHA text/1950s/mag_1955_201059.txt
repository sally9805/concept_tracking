" It 's kind of like leaning over the back fence chatting , " explains Earl Selby , a top reporter and columnist on the Philadelphia Bulletin . " The problems may not be earthshakers , but they hit the neighbor where he lives . " Selby 's chats take place Mondays through Fridays at 6:25 p.m. on Mr. Fixit , a local show telecast by Station WCAU-TV . Sometimes blond , crew-cut Earl Selby , 37 , uses his five minutes to point up some civic horror , as when he appeared unshaven and in tattered clothes to talk about Skid Row and what it costs the city-$650,000 in relief and a high incidence of tuberculosis . Another time , discussing trees , he wore a lumberjack 's hat and carried an ax . More often , he simply helps people get what they want . Some of Selby 's fixes : <P> Found a shoe shop for a young teacher who displayed her 5AAAA foot and complained that she could not find any places that sold her size in fashionable styles . <P> Found an Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple who had been searching everywhere . <P> Got expert advice for a man plagued by bats in his window shutters ( a bat expert advised that he use a broom and let more light in between the shutter leaves ) . <P> Searched out a prom dress for a girl who could not afford one . Selby found a thrift shop that sold formals for as little as $3-in the next few days he got 600 letters asking for a list of the city 's thrift shops . <P> Selby has wangled gloves for a kids ' baseball team , taught a Scottish bride-to-be how to season steak before broiling ( rub on hot mustard , top with hickory salt ) , found aquariums for some boys who had brought a batch of snakes back from camp . He has had some failures , too . He had no solution for the woman who wrote : " Sheriff coming to foreclose tomorrow . Please send $4,000 in cash , " and he was unable to finance a trip to the Canadian wilds for a would-be Davy Crockett who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsor ( Philadelphia Gas Works Co. ) and an audience estimated to include 43% of the adults viewing at that hour . It started last March after an adman named Franklin Roberts saw Reporter Selby on a straight newscast . Roberts told Selby he was a poor commentator because he was not reporting what he knows best : Philadelphia , its people and its problems . He suggested a show growing out of the " In Our Town " column that Selby writes six days a week for the Bulletin , and they finally settled on the column 's " Mr. Fixit " service idea .
