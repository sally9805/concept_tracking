No man in Canadian politics ever looked the part of a Prime Minister more completely-or wanted the job more earnestly-than handsome , patrician George Alexander Drew , 62 . After resigning as Premier of Ontario in 1948 to take over as national leader of the Progressive Conservative Party , Drew fought hard through two national election campaigns . But the Liberals , who combined a New Dealish program of social reform with a hard-headed regard for balanced budgets , rolled over the Tories for their fourth and fifth straight national victories , relegating Drew to the gadfly role of Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons . Last week , as both major parties tooled up for a new national election that now seems likely for next summer , Drew summoned his two top assistants to Toronto , handed them his resignation as leader of the party . <P> Drew suffered an attack of meningitis two years ago , made a good recovery , and returned to lead his party in the House of Commons this year with vigor and effectiveness . But the grinding routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their toll . Near exhaustion , Drew left the House in the closing days of this summer 's session for an extended rest ; twice he entered hospitals to try to regain his strength . Last week Drew 's physician bluntly warned him that he could no longer carry his old responsibilities without serious danger to his health . Drew drafted a letter of resignation , delayed signing it until he had had another talk with his wife and his doctor , then summoned his aides , asked them to announce that he was quitting as party leader . <P> Drew 's departure leaves the Tories with no obvious successor , but a handful of likely candidates among their senior M.P.s . The party high command expects to call a convention for November or December to pick a new leader , then start the national buildup that they hope will give him a fighting chance for victory next year .
