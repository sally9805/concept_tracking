txt President Eisenhower is showing increasing ' concern over the certain deficit of at least 3 billion dollars in the current fiscal year , and the prospect of an 8 to 15 billion dollar deficit next year . Mr. Eisenhower 's hopes for a balance of receipts and expenditures during his White House occupancy have been shattered by the steadily mounting federal spending against the recession and to meet the Russian challeuge in the space age . May Reach 15 Billions In his first two fiscal years , Mr. Eisenhower went in the red by 4.74 billion dollars . In the next two years he had surpluses of 3.27 to give him a net deficit of 1.47 b ill io n dollars . In the current fiscal year , which ends June 30 , Secretary of the Treasury Robert B. Anderson estimated that the deficit will be at least 3 billion dollars . For the fiscal year beginning next July 1 , the deficit may be anywhere from 8 to 15 billion dollars , which will kill all hope of placing the government in the black over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry F. Byrd D. , Va. , long time federal economy advocate and chairman of the Senate finance committee , said the government appears to be headed toward an 8 billion dollar deficit in the next fiscal year even without a tax cut . A tax cut would increase the deficit by 5 to 7 billions , depending on how deep and how extensive the cut will be on personal income , corporations , and excises . Anderson has estimated that the deficit for the next fiscal year will be about 4 billion dollars . Mr. Etisenhower last January ? estimated that the deficit would be 400 million dollars for the current fiscal year , and that a 500 million dollar surplus would be achieved next year . Resists Tax Cut Now ? The President has resisted pressure for an immediate tax cut , by putting off any decision in the expectation of a shift upward in the national economy . He has vetoed the farm price freeze bill and the 1.6 billion dollar rivers and Ira r b o r s bill  --  the so-called pork barrel bill . wtoutei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to veto the action in an attempt to hold down the deficit . However , the decision would be one of the most difficult he has had to make , because many believe that a tax cut is the surest way to improving the economy . The administration is not set against lowering some excise taxes , such as that on automobiles , or cutting luxury taxes . If these cuts were coupled by Congress to reductions in personal and corporate income taxes . Mr. Eisenhower 's decision would be made more difficult . t Byrd bases his estimate of an 8 billion dollar deficit in the coming fiscal year on a sharper drop in revenues than Anderson anticipates . I think the deficit is likely to run 8 billion dollars or Oven more , " Byrd said in an interview . " The treasury estimated a 2 billion dollar increase in revenues for fiscal 1959 . But the indications are now that there will be a 2 billion drop instead of an inc. ease . -1 ' When the effects of the acceleration in spending begin to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think : Me increase in spending will Xpn to at least 4 billion dollars , with the drop in reveAin , will make the total deficit at  --  least 8 billion dollars . " Reventie Estimate Difficult Anderson estimated that expenditures in the current fiscal year will be " well over " 73 billion dollars , while revenue receipts will be around 70 billion dollars . Anderson acknowledged receipts are difficult to estimate because of the " irregular pattern of pay ments . " Anderson estimated t it a t spending in the fiscal year from July 1 , 1958 , to June 30 , 1959 , will be " in the order of magnitude of 78 billion dolgars . " Withput a tax cut , but with no appreciable increase in revenue this could point to an 8 billion dollar deficit , as Byrd views the situation . Anderson said the administration is giving daily consideration to the advisability of a tax cut . He , like the President , is opposed to any abrupt reduction . Byrd said he believes that sentiment against a tax reduction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress . More members are coming to favor expenditures on public works as an anti-recession measure , he said .
