txt The Supreme Court agreed to listen to publishers ' complaints that the International Typographical Union violated the Taft-Hartley Act by ' featherbedding " The tribunal said it would review a case brought against a National Labor Relations Board ruling by the American Newspaper Publishers Association . A Circuit Court of Appeals backed the N.L R B. The ruling the publftlfhers did n't like said it was all right for the I.T.U. to require its members to set type for an advertisement and then throw away the type without using it . This practice is called setting " bogus . " ' What happens is that an advertiser sends to a newspaper an ad in What to caned " matrix " form . This means the ad has already been put in type and an impression made from it . All the newspaper has to do is pour hot metal against the matrix and it , has a plate from which it can print the ad on its presses . But the union requires that such an ad must be set by hand in the newspaper 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it is thrown away and the matrix sent in by the advertiser is used anyway . Extra labor for " bogus " costs thousands of dollars annually , the publishers say . They are paying for " services which aie not performed or not to be performed , " they claim . That 's " featherbedding " and is illegal . The N L R.B . though , saw nothing wrong with the process because the printers were regularly employed and spent only about 57 , - of their time setting " bogus . " Also during yesterday 's opening session of the 1952 court term , the tribunal refused to take up other A N.P.A. complaints that the union forced its members to ' comply with an " illegal " bargaining policy . This pressure included threatening the I.T.U. members with expulsion and loss of pension and mortuary benefits , said the publishers . According to the . N.L.R.B , this pressure did n't make any difference because the TaftHartley Act gave unions full power to regulate their own memberships . A third phase of the case also failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union wanted a reversal of an N.L.R.B. ruling that it had run afoul of the Taft-Hartley Act by forcing a closed shop on the newspapers . In all three complaints , the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled for the NLRB.
