For 22 months , the United Nations has been pursuing peace at the truce table in Korea , while the fighting has gone on . With the Communist generals calling the combat turns , the U.N . was only fending off the enemy . Time after time , the prospect of a truce seemed bright , then faded as the casualty lists inexorably grew . This week there were signs once more that a Korean truce might be a reality in a matter of days . <P> But as the truce prospect brightened once again , the U.S. grew more conscious of a basic question about the Korean situation : Under present conditions , is truce on the same side as right ? It is a question which a peace-minded nation faces reluctantly . Yet it was an inevitable question once the U.S. entered a war for a moral principle and then permitted its will-to-win to be hobbled by hesitation on the battlefield and by the pressures of domestic and international politics . <P> Last week the question of right prompted widespread misgivings , based largely on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has yet offered-might turn out in fact to be victory for the Communists . Fearful of impending advantages for the Communists in Asia , the Senate Appropriations Committee , by a vote of 20 to 3 , attached a rider to an appropriations bill providing that the U.S. will cut off funds for the United Nations if Communist China is admitted to the U.N . In Cincinnati , Senate Majority Leader Robert A. Taft proposed that the U.S. " forget the United Nations " in Korea and work out its own solution if the new truce drive fails . Bob Taft touched a sensitive nerve : many U.S. citizens believe that perhaps the U.S. is yielding up its leadership in an effort to find a settlement formula agreeable to its allies , without safeguarding the oft-repeated promise of a unified Korea . <P> The question of right took on new and more dangerous proportions when Syngman Rhee 's South Korean government voiced its violent opposition to the new United Nations truce plan ( see WAR IN ASIA ) . Furious because the current plan does not point toward a unified Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the U.N . and fight on alone . <P> Perhaps the clearest answer to the question of truce v. right came from South Korea 's Ambassador to the U.S. , Dr. You Chan Yang . Facing reporters on NBC 's Meet the Press television show this week , Dr. Yang expressed a truth that the U.N . has not yet accepted . Said he : " If the Communists are talking about peace it is not as you and I are talking about peace . When we talk about peace we 're talking about real peace . When the Communists are talking about peace they 're talking about something else ; they 're talking about conquest . "
