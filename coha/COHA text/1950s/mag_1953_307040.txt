One day last summer , TIME 'S Seattle bureau chief . Dean Brelis , was aboard a small launch in the middle of Lake Washington , watching a trial run of the Slo-Mo-Shun IV , 1952 Gold Cup winner . Suddenly a sailboat slid effortlessly up to the launch . As the sailboat started to turn , a young lady standing in the bow tossed a stone into the launch . Brelis picked up the stone , found a piece of paper wrapped around it with thick rubber bands . On the paper was a message for him to get in touch with Western Union 's Operator 25 immediately , for a wire from TIME . <P> Operator 25 is many people with many functions-and , obviously , many facets of ingenuity . Basically , Western Union uses Operator 25 as a commercial service . If , for instance , you want to find out the name of the local distributor of the Cant-Chu-U dog muzzle , Operator 25 can tell you . In many cities , Operator 25 is also the person to call back when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that capacity , Operator 25-or her counterpart-has become a familiar voice to many TIME correspondents . <P> Says Brelis : " Operator 25 is uncanny . I have never met her , but she is like a shadow . She has contacted me at home or at the Washington Athletic Club . Once she paged me in a movie , told the manager that it was an important wire from New York and that TIME was holding the presses-a fabrication on the grandest level . " <P> Across the continent , in Providence , R.I. , Ben Bagdikian calls Operator 25 his " favorite Western Union employee . " She seems to know what time he arrives home , once told his wife : " When he gets home at 5:30 , will you have him call Operator 25 ? I 've got a long one from TIME . " She knows wires are to be sent to his office after they are read to him . Says Bagdikian : " She is a sympathetic audience and often giggles appreciatively at a query , but is also capable of indignation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When TIME asks for a cross section of opinion on a subject in the news , she can sometimes give a general idea about the ratio of pro to anti telegrams and their intensity . " <P> What Bagdikian remembers most vividly about Operator 25 concerns a wire he once sent about a proposal by Rhode Island Governor Dennis . Roberts that the state build industrial plants for leasing to private firms . Roberts called the plan " a lively experiment . " Bagdikian explained thai the expression came from the inscription on the State House , which he quoted from memory : " To hold forth a lively experiment that a most flourishing state may stand and best be maintained with full liberty in religious concernments . " A little later he got a message to call Operator 25 . Should n't the quotation read , she asked politely , " that a most flourishing civil state may stand ? " He found a state manual , looked it up , and called back to tell Operator 25 she was right . He asked how she had known . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it almost daily .
