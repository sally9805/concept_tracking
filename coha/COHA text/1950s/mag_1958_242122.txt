The outside world knows little about the man who is generally ranked No. 2 to Mao Tse-tung . Greater headlines have gone to Chou En-lai and to Marshal Chu Teh , but the man next in line is presumed to be Liu Shao-chi , Moscow-trained party theoretician . Last week Red China published his 16,000-word keynote speech to the 19-day closed session of the eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party . His confident theme : " In the past the party concentrated its efforts mainly on socialist revolution . . . Now we can and must concentrate on socialist construction . " <P> Declaring that " crisis , unemployment and disunity " are " discrediting " the " imperialist world , " Liu described with confidence and sober optimism the prospects for Communist China and the Soviet bloc . With repeated quotations from Marx , Lenin and Mao Tse-tung ( who was among the 1,000-odd delegates present ) , Liu urged increased production to surpass Britain in 15 years . His new slogan : " Hard work for a few years ; happiness for a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production this year , against 2,200,000 tons only four years ago . But in the fine print , not all was so rosy . He was significantly silent on last year 's harvest and this year 's crop prospects . He regretted " excessive wage increases " in 1956 but denied that that year had been one of " reckless advance . " He admitted that a retrenchment had followed , but for those who weary of such economic jargon as saucering out of recession , Liu had a classic new Communist equivalent to offer : there had been , he said , a " U-shaped advance " in China 's economy during the past two years . The first four months of 1958 had registered a significant " leap forward " in industrial and agricultural production , he added . Western specialists believe there is opposition inside the top leadership over the relentless " leap forward " policy , and noted how much space Liu devoted to justifying the speedup . Connoisseurs of Communist politics also noted that Liu gave " credit " for the policy no less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .
