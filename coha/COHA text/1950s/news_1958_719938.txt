txt LONDON , Sept. ** can never say again that despite what is happening in the States or South Africa it ca n't happen here , " a Briton said this week . " It is happening here , and how it stinks . " The shame and amazement expressed by one man is almost universal . Even those who in the past have strongly opposed unrestricted immigration of Commonwealth and colonial Negroes into Britain are too shocked to say , " I told you so , " as they contemplate the ugly , naked violence in northwest London 's race riots . Hatred of white for Negro and Negro for white is the principal but not the only reason for the stabbings , clubbings and beatings that have shocked this customarily placid society . Another reason is that the riots have symbolized the breakdown of tolerance , respect for law and order and the essential homogeneity that have enabled this comparatively small nation on the lip of Europe to perform prodigies of national effort . Racial hatred in its most violent form is so shocking when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to unusual exaggeration . Nevertheless there are some who see in the riots the accelerated dissolution of a responsible democratic society . British Background But it may also be argued that what has happened in northwest London and Nottingham is basically a reflection of the turbulent aggressiveness that lies beneath the outward stolidity of the British character . British respect for law and order , after all , came to flower only in the long quiet week-end of Victoria 's reign . Before that the British people were known as the most rowdy , disrespectful and brawling of European peoples . The conditions that fostered the riots are clear . Take a down-at-the-heels section of a great metropolis with a reputation for violence and crime stretching back nearly a century . Then add to it large numbers of young white men , many of them rootless immigrants from Ireland , who are in London to make money and who want room and bed rather than home and family . Add again , since 1952 or 1953 , large numbers of West Indian Negroes who are clannish , sexually ostentatious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressively determined to establish their rights in alien sand . Let the Negroes move into the brokendown houses of the area , buying some and ejecting through threats or actions , such as locking the toilets against them , the previous residents . By the standards of the United States or South Africa there are not many Negroes , involved . The Negro population of all Britain is less than.200,000 out of 50,000,000 . There are probably from 5,000 to 7,000 Negroes in the Notting Hill and Paddington areas . Because they fight shy of official forms , no one knows exactly how ninny there are . Sexual and economic competition brought the racial animosity to head . White girls cohabited with Negroes . Negroes lived on the earnings of white prostitutes . West . Indian families moved into two rooms in a house and others followed . When a white man lost his job he blamed it on " the blacks .

The disruption of the last war and the subsequent shifts in the population lessened paternal authority and weakened the importance of the home . Youngsters of 16 and 17 are making more money than I their fathers did a quarter of a century ago as grown men . The cult of violence preached by the movies , comic books and cheap fiction has impressed them and moved them to imitation . Finally , this seething mass of jealousy , combativeness and animosity has been inflamed by cheap whisky and gin and by the work of Sir Oswald Mosley 's British Union Movement , a Fascist organization demanding a " white Britain . " In view of all this it is surprising that the outbreaks took so long to develop . For the Negroes have been pouring into the area for nearly five years . Throughout the past century the British have prided themselves on the fact of their tolerance . The Englishman can talk tough about the " Yanks " or ' " frogs " or " niggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Beliefs Shaken That race prejudice nonetheless exists in a particularly violent and degrading form has shaken the Britons ' belief in their superiority in such matters . This can only be good . For one thing it will force the Government to consider settlement of the Negro immigrants in areas where they and the whites have a better chance to come to terms with each other . There are also strong indications that unrestricted immigration from Commonwealth and colonial nations may end . The only encouraging aspect of the disturbances is that they may lead the British to take a more tolerant and intelligent attitude toward racial problems elsewhere . Henceforth Little Rock should not be considered as evidence of original sin among white Americans . United States officials may no longer be pilloried because they are unable to introduce an earthly paradise of racial tolerance . The British have been forced to come to grips with the problem . It has happened here .
