txt The scientists of the world too ' the first step today toward making the harnessing of the hydrogen bomb an international project . For the first time , Communist and Western scientists openly discussed the previously secret work they have been doing to achieve a controlled thermoRuclear reaction . In this new air of international and academic freedom , Communist and Western scientists expressed the hope that through cooperation they could hasten the achievement of thermonuclear power to solve the energy needs of the , world . They cautioned , however , that science was just starting down the path toward thermonuclear energy and that the path was long and strewn with problems . This dramatic tearing down of the walls of secrecy on the topic took place before the scientists from sixty-seven nations gathered for the Second International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy . In the crowded assembly room of the old League of Nations building , scientists of the United States , Britain and the Soviet Union discussed the possibility of controlled fusion , or thermonuclear power , and described the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The papers disclosed that despite the past secrecy , the Communist and Western nations had been independently pursuing remarkably similar lines of research in their attempts to produce a controlled thermonuclear reaction . Significantly none of the nations was yet ready to say with certainly it had reached the milestone of producing a controlled thermonuclear reaction on a laboratory scale . All indicated they thought they were on the threshold of this achievement , if in fact it had not already been attained but not proved . The similarity of approaches and findings arrived at in inde. pendent secrecy , said Dr. H. J. Bhabha , chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India , was " an indication of what secrecy has cost the world for no useful purpose . " Dr. Bhabha was chairman of today 's session on the possibility of controlled fusion . It was Dr. Bhabha who at the first atoms-for-peace conference in 1955 first publicly discussed the possibility of controlling the fusion process of the hydrogen bomb , thus providing the opening chink in the walls of nationalistic secrecy . Cooperation Offered East-West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. A. Artsimovich of the Soviet Union and Dr. Edward Teller of the United States . In a paper read for him by a colleague , Dr. Artsimovich noted that for the first time results of past research " will be discussed on an international scale . " " This is probably the most important step which has been made toward the solution of this problem , " Dr. Artsimovich said . " The importance of this fact is greater than that of the separate investigations , which as yet have not brought us very much nearer to our ultimate goal . " Dr. Teller , the physicist customarily called " the father of the hydrogen bomb , " said he wished to express the same sentiments . Dr. Teller commented that " it is wonderful that in this very important area of research we can all talk together and work together freely . " He expressed hope that such international scientific cooperation could be extended to other fields of research . Few Startling Disclosures The review papers of past research produced few . artling disclosures  --  except for the similarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to having achieved a controlled thermonuclear reaction was made by Dr. Artsimovich , who said that one of the Soviet machines , a " pinch " device , had achieved temperatures exceeding 3,000 , - 000 degrees and produced neutrons that might have been of thermonuclear origin . He did not , however , lay much stress on this point . The formal papers of the British and United States scientists , who have burned their fingers in the past with premature claims of having created thermonuclear fire , were pointedly conservative in describing their research . They reported temperatures exceeding 1,000,000 degree ? . At a news conference afterward , however , Dr. P. C. Thonemann of the British Atomic Energy Authority , said it had been " confirmed " that the British Zeta device had attained tempereatures of 5,000,000 degrees and higher . U. S. May Be Close Dr. Teller reported that the Scylla device developed at the Las Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico " seems to be getting close to the point " of producing thermonuclear neutrons " but we are not willing to make any claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scylla may be reaching temperatures of 10,000,000 degrees . In the devices developed by the Communist and Western nations , the object is to heat an ionized gas of a heavy form of hydrogen , such as deuterium , to temperatures of tens of millions of degrees until the nuclei of the gas atoms collide and fuse . In this fusion reaction  --  the basis of the energy of the sun and the hydrogen bomb  --  energy and neutrons are given off . Independently , the Soviet Union and British and American scientists since 1956 have developed various forms of magnetic devices to contain and heat the ionized gas to the thermonuclear ignition point ? such as " pinch " machines in straight and doughnut shapes with an internal magnetic field , stellarators with an exterior magnetic-confining field , and magnetic mirror machines . A Novel Soviet Approach One novel approach was reported by the Soviet Union , which said that in 1952 it tried triggering a controlled thermonuclear reaction by setting off several tons of TNT around a container of deuterium , thus providing pressure and heat for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high temperatures " and neutrons were achieved , but the approach " proved to be rather difficult in practice " and has been dropped . A key problem reported encountered by all the scientists was the difficulty of keeping the ionized gas or plasma stable under magnetic constriction so it did not touch the walls of the " magnetic bottles " thereby cooling off the plasma . Dr. Thonemann said this problem of containment and instabilities in the plasma " is the principal stumbling block at the present time . " All the scientists made clear that it probably would be decades before they could solve all the problems involved in achieving economic thermonuclear power . Dr. Thonemann estimated that it would take a decade to answer the question of whether electricity could be generated from the fusion reaction and ten years more to answer the question of whether such power would be economically valuable . Dr. Teller predicted that " economic exploitation of controlled thermonuclear reactions may not turn out to be possible before the end of the twentieth century . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
