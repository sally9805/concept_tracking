The decision as to whether the U.S. should make a hydrogen bomb , said Harry Truman , is mine and nobody else 's . But there were a lot of people looking over his shoulder , and they seemed remarkably in agreement on how he should play his hand : they wanted the H-bomb-built . <P> " I am very unhappy , " said Dr. Harold Clayton Urey , the Nobel Prizewinning atomic chemist , " to conclude that the hydrogen bomb should be developed and built . I do not think we should intentionally lose the armaments race ; to do this will be to lose our liberties , and with Patrick Henry , I value my liberties more than I do my life . " <P> Should the Russians win the race and build the first H-bomb , he added , they might decide that they did not even have to use it . They might say : " ' We will build these bombs and issue ultimata to the western countries , and the millenium of Communism will be with us immediately ... ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Americans for Democratic Action in New York 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , had a right to be heard . His Nobel Prize had been won in 1934 for the discovery of heavy hydrogen , a basic step toward the development both of the first atomic bomb and any hydrogen bomb that may come . He had predicted the date of the Russian atomic bomb explosion far more accurately than had U.S. military or political leaders . <P> " I personally hope very much , " he said , " that the hydrogen bombs will not explode . . . However , nature does not behave in the way I should like at times , and so there is no use in engaging in wishful thinking . I think we should assume that the bomb can be built . " His estimate of the cost of development : $100 million . <P> Others joined in , urging the building of the H-bomb : Elder Statesman Bernard Baruch , Republican Senator John Bricker , Eleanor Roosevelt , Senator Tom Connally . <P> What , then-or who-was holding up the President 's decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the H-bomb , they did not make their arguments public . Many a Washington correspondent pointed the finger at retiring Atom Boss David Lilienthal , who last week characterized all such stories about him as " inaccurate , " but was careful-on security grounds-not to say just where he did stand . <P> This week the President made his decision . He ordered work on the H-bomb to go ahead . Harry Truman 's announcement had in it no sabre-rattling swagger , only the reluctant awareness of a duty that had to be done . He knew that he was authorizing construction of the deadliest weapon ever known to man . <P> White House aides on Tuesday afternoon summoned a dozen reporters , handed them this statement from the President : <P> " It is part of my responsibility as commander-in-chief of the armed forces to see to it that our country is able to defend itself against any possible aggressor . <P> " Accordingly , I have directed the Atomic Energy Commission to continue its work on all forms of atomic weapons , including the so-called hydrogen or superbomb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is being and will be carried forward on a basis consistent with the over-all objectives of our program for peace and security .
