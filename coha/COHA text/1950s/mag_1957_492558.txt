" We got it , " someone responded , " but we 're gon na shoot it up right here . " The man pointed to a table in a corner , On it lay a teaspoon , blackened from having had its contents heated with lighted matches . Beside it were homemade hypodermics consisting of regular hypo needles mounted on eye droppers . And a small waxed-paper packet of floury white " stuff " ? about fifty dollars ' worth of heroin . The man gestured toward the table . " Not me , " Dorothy said hastily . " You do n't go sticking it into my arm tonight . I got ta go see the probation officer tomorrow . Any fresh needle marks in my arm , and you know what happens to me . " At her refusal , another man and his girl edged forward and eyed her suspiciously . " She look wrong to you ?

" Just lock the door , " one of the men said . They did . There was no window . Through the door , Dorothy heard them arguing over what to do with her . There were ugly suggestions . She heard the phrase " looks wrong " again and again . " Wrong " is the dope trade 's term for a police informer or spy . Finally the door opened . Only men confronted Dorothy this time . One fired a question , " If you are all right , woman , who do you know ? " Dorothy named a notorious drug peddler as someone from whom she had bought " the stuff " before . The tension cased . " Fine ! " someone said . " He 's corning here later tonight . Then we 'll know if you are right or wrong . " The big-shot peddler was due to arrive about midnight . He did not get there until the following morning at nine . During those long night hours , Dorothy did not suffer alone . Fifty police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her and for her . The ( Continued on Page 101 ) drug addicts , as it happened , had guessed correctly . From their viewpoint , Dorothy was very wrong indeed . She was an undercover policewoman who had gathered evidence for many dope arrests . When she ventured out on the assignment which got her trapped , there were already rumors and questions about her in the half dream , half sharply real world of the dope trade . Many users and peddlers knew of her buying drugs , but all agreed that no one had seen her actually use the stuff . Another circumstance made her plight precarious . Usually , two armed policemen followed her at a distance as protectors . That night they lost her . The drug user who was her contact had , deliberately or otherwise , intercepted her on the wrong corner on spotting her car . Her guardians , going to the right corner , drew a blank . After hours of cruising around and hunting , they telephoned headquarters at two A.M. , " We ca n't find Dorothy anywhere. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't shown up there . Her husband , upset and fearful , joined in the search . Police checked the hospitals , and finally the morgue . No Dorothy . They broadcast the license number and description of her car , without other identification . Nat even the car , obscurely parked . could be located . The quickest way to rescue Dorothy , the police concluded , would be to broadcast a complete description identifying her as a policewoman . That would put pressure on anyone forcibly holding her , and might save her from danger . " But if we did that , " a police official explained later , " it would have revealed that we were using women undercover investigators and have wrecked our whole highly successful system of arresting dope pushers through them . We faced a tough choice : Save Dorothy or smash the dope rackets . We set one P.M. as the deadline . At one , we would broadcast for Dorothy . At about twelve twenty-five the phone rang . A feeble voice , barely recognizable as Dorothy 's , said , Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her story : Fortunately for her , the big drug peddler she named was one from whom she actually had bought drugs , but who had not yet been arrested on her evidence . When he finally arrived , he said , " Sure , she 's all right . Sell her a couple of bags of the stuff . " Anyone of lesser courage might have paid up and hurried away , but not Dorothy . By then , the room held almost a small convention of dope peddlers . Calmly she explained , " This is Saturday morning and I 'm going away for the weekend with some other junkies . Any of you other folks want to sell me some stuff . so 's we 'll have enough for a long week-end ? " When she finally walked out into the fresh air , her purse held eight packages of illegal drugs . Women such as Dorothy Garvin are one of the reasons that Philadelphia now claims the happy distinction of being the most-dope-free big city . Attractive young policewomen , mostly rookies direct from the Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great risk , they ventured into the haunts of the half-crazed dope world . There they collected evidence at first hand . City officials say the campaign made it very nearly impossible to buy heroin , the powdered opium derivative which is the enslaving best-seller of the underworld drug trade . The Philadelphia cleanup so impressed Price Daniel , then chairman of the Senate judiciary subcommittee on narcotics , and now governor of Texas , that he termed it " the most effective program for stamping out the illicit drug traffic of any city in the United States . " After direct police testimony to legislators , both Federal and state governments enacted stiffer penalties for inveterate dope peddlers . The state law authorizes life for third offenders . The Federal statute , signed last July by President Eisenhower , permits juries to impose the death penalty for the sale of heroin to youngsters under eighteen . The devastation done by the drug habit among juveniles and females led some of the policewomen to volunteer for undercover duty , One mother of several small daughters explained , " We felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides being torture in itself , is the straightest downhill road to prostitution . A woman caught by the drug habit wilt do anything to get the stuff . So they become double victims . Nearly all of the women addicts we encountered were prostitutes or on their way to becoming such . " As city officials point out , the " Police Academy Debutantes " did not wage or win the battle against narcotics alone . Hundreds of plainclothesmen and uniformed police , Federal narcotics agents , Pennsylvania and Federal judges , and three consecutive Philadelphia district attorneys contributed mightily . The story begins , in fact , not with a woman but with a man . Thomas F. McDermott , square-cut and fifty-one , with wavy gray hair and direct blue eyes , is a career detective . He holds a rare professional distinction : Plainclothes investigator for twenty-eight of his twenty-nine years as a police officer . His role in the dope drive helped to win him promotion to chief county detective . In 1954 , Tom McDermott was a detective lieutenant in search of a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to work with the veteran Joseph M. Bransky , regional director of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics . Enforcement was then undermanned and anemic . Bransky had only seven investigators to handle three states , including the Philadelphia area . " At that time , " McDermott says , " nobody had the men or money for real undercover work . Junkies  --  drug addicts  --  spend as much as fifty dollars a day for the stuff . When an undercover investigator must buy evidence at five to twenty-five dollars a bag , it takes a lot of money . " At Bransky 's suggestion , relayed by McDermott , Commissioner Gibbons assigned some city policemen to co-operate with the Federal agents in undercover work . To finance them , Richardson Dilworth , then district attorney and now mayor of Philadelphia , persuaded City Council later on to earmark a sum for the weird purpose of having the city buy illegal drugs . There began a fantastic make believe . The headquarters of the narcotics drive operated like a theatrical casting office , though the process was reversed . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh faces 01. the Police Academy rookies , unknown to the underworld . Then they cast each for a plain-clothes role which would fit him snugly into dope circles . Because drug addiction flourishes among some jazz musicians , rookie Patrolman Joseph Addairio posed as a clarinetist . A police photographer provided him with a sheaf of photos of himself in soulful attitudes , eyes half closed , fingering his clarinet . Lugging photos and instrument wherever he went , he made fifty-five purchases of heroin . Actually , he was constantly on the spot . If a suspicious dope peddler had commanded " Play ! " he could n't have toothed a note . He did n't know how . Gilbert Henegan , another rookie , who preferred police work to civilian jobs after three years in the Army , had spent two years on a GI scholarship , studying business psychology . Gleefully , McDermott and company decided that Henegan , with that background , should " go into business for himself " as a dope peddler . This gave him a ready approach . He went comparison shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " In five months he bought illicit drugs 137 times from sixty-two peddlers , Patrolman Burden Beaman , a Korean combat veteran scarcely larger than a schoolboy , adopted an extreme disguise . He dressed in woman 's clothing . As his deep , resonant male voice would have been a giveaway , he pretended to be a deaf mutt . It quickly developed that dope peddlers were not immune to anything which might pass for feminine charm . Beaman 's success was so noteworthy that it prompted the use of undercover policewomen . Never uttering a word , the policeman , with a little girlish hip swinging , managed to buy sixty-three packages of heroin . " The success of these and other policemen assigned as undercover agents astounded the Federal Bureau of Narcotics , " McDermott says . " Nobody ever had hit the jack pot like this anywhere before . " In three typical years , 1952-53-54 , the handful of enforcement officers arrested a total of seventy alleged narcotics sellers in Philadelphia on Federal charges . More than a third were later freed . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDermott says , in little more than a year . " They went in and out so fast that they enjoyed what has been termed ' revolving-door justice . ' " The first blow of the new city-Federal enforcement campaign fell early in 1955 . On the strength of undercover evidence , police raiding parties rounded up eighty-two dope sellers in a single night . By the end of the fourth big raid , less than a year and a half later , the score stood at 408 arrests of alleged heroin peddlers . Confronted by grocery cartons full of evidence , 391 went to jail . Nearly all are still there , serving some of the stiffest sentences possible under laws in effect at the time . A combination of state and Federal court action whipsawed the dope racketeers into prison . After the first raid , the sellers posted 51000 in Federal bail as usual . Then a nightmarish thing , from their viewpoint , befell them . City police herded them in vans to City Hall , where they were held in 510,000 to 550A000 slate bail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big sums . The legal strategy which kept the dope dealers in jail is credited to Dilworth , the district attorney who is now mayor . The sale of narcotics in Pennsylvania is both a Federal and a state offense . Previously , Philadelphia had left the prosecution to the Federal Government , although it could have tried dope dealers in the local courts for the identical offenses . Now Dilworth urged , " Let 's go after them ourselves . " The Federal prosecutors also wanted them . So , for the first time , the dope racketeers got both barrels . A competition in speedy justice began . Fully half of the first raid defendants were indicted and headed for trial by the state before any Federal action was taken . Judge Vincent Carroll , of Philadelphia , cut short a vacation to conduct a special state narcotics court . Most defendants " copped the plea . " Confronted by testimony involving repeated sales directly to law officers , instead of a transaction or two with addicts , nearly all hopefully pleaded guilty . Carroll dropped the ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal court sentence had been about two years , Carroll imposed sentences averaging five years and running as high as twenty-five years in one notorious case . The Federal district court , always relatively fast-moving , meanwhile hurried up its narcotics trials . In instances where it dealt out routine short-term sentences to defendants not yet tried by the state , Judge Carroll haled the defendants before him and imposed two years on behalf of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania . With a nice reciprocity which the dazed dope peddlers failed to appreciate , the Federal judges tried Carroll 's original defendants and gave them terms to run concurrently with their state sentences . Although this did not extend their time , it made parole almost impossible . Anyone getting out of T H E SATURDAY EVZNINO POST state prison could be sure of getting right into a Federal penitentiary . During the trials , the police handed the narcotics trade another awful shock . Traditionally , law enforcement relaxes during court sessions . Many enforcers must attend court to testify . The underworld assumes that the others rest on their laurels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peddlers who escaped the first raids began doing a brisk business with clients of their jailed competitors  --  or so they thought . Much of the business , they later learned to their sorrow , was with a fresh platoon of undercover police . What jarred the drug peddlers to the bottoms of their cynical souls was a painful discovery ; Many of the new evidence gatherers were girls barely out of their teens . Never before had they encountered the like . The drug trade 's slang for a law enforcer was , indicatively , " The Man . " Now , incredibly , Young women sprang the trap . Many pushers quit trusting the entire opposite sex . The foray of the female undercover agents was thoroughly planned . If anything , they were more carefully selected and coached than the men . McDermott and two other raid leaders , Lt. Glasgow Driscoll and Caps , Clarence J. Ferguson , stood in the back of rookie classes at the Police Academy and studied each new policewoman . Could she pass as a dope addict ? Occasionally a new girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . It was , one said later , a little like being pledged to a sorority , but a strange , dedicated group to be associated with the lowest , not the highest , in society . " We told each girl , " McDermott says , " that the work was sordid , dirty , thankless , risky  --  and that they did n't have to do it . Very few backed down . " To minimize the risk of being found out and possibly knifed or strangled , the volunteers went through special schooling in underworld craft . Then each girl was teamed up with a pair of patrolmen . The men followed her in a car with a miniature chemical laboratory . At the first opportunity , they tested whatever she bought . If it was heroin , it purpled . To detect phonies , some pushers peddled powdered sugar , talcum , even scrapings of wall plaster . If the powder failed to purple , the girl had to rush back to the pusher and complain that it did n't give her " a lift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was an addict ; it gave her an opportunity to buy unquestionably genuine heroin which could be preserved as evidence . The patrolmen operated under orders to protect their girls from violence . It was a tough assignment . At least one girl made it more so . She felt it cramped her style . " No man will do as a woman asks , " she confided . " Tell a man how you want him to cover you , and he 'll do it his way . Then everything goes wrong . I finally dumped my ' protectors ' altogether . " " Those girls , " one police official says with tribute in his voice , " broke the back of the illegal narcotics trade here . They made the cleanup just about as complete as possible . Take Margaret Logan ? " Margaret Logan is a little redhead in her twenties , with freckles and a smile , After six years as a hospital nurse , she ? took a civil-service examination for policewoman . The work , she assumed , would be in the Juvenile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People of all ages confide in me. " she remarks , " so I thought I could put that to some Me ' Tapped while at the Police Academy , she found herself playing it grim confidence game , It was shortly before Christmas , 1955 , In an atmosphere of tinseled gaiety , Margaret went Christmas shopping for narcotics . Ironically , her first three purchases of heroin were neatly done up in holiday wrappings held together by " Merry Christmas " stickers . " The pusher in this case used a drugstore as his place of business , " Margaret says . " There were three pay phone booths . Once you became acquainted with him , you could call him over any of the three phones . He would put the stuff , wrapped , in the booth you called . Then he would sit at a counter stool just across the store and watch . You would come in , pretend to phone . pick up the stuff and put it five-or ten-dollar bill for it in the coin-return slot . The packages I bought from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool anyone who saw them and partly because . in his way , this dope pusher liked to feel that he was a nice , jolly fellow , " Of all the undercover agents , Margaret struck up perhaps thecoziest acquaintance with the dope trade . It was entirely unintentional . A pusher casually left her for thirteen hours in a small room with eight real addicts . " This pusher was one I had bought from before , " she relates . " When I phoned him for more at nine-thirty one morning , he told me to meet him at a small home in South Philadelphia . There were seven people waiting there , and another arrived later , All gave the pusher ten or twenty dollars , He added my money to a roll of bills and said , ' Now HI go buy some for you . ' That was about ten Add . He did n't return until eleven that night . He went to New York for it . " Her biggest trouble came when the pusher finally arrived with the stuff , Margaret said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then and there . Everyone but me , that is . I pleaded that I had to share mine with a boy friend who had been waiting for me all day . They said O.K. , and I scooted with the evidence . " Often . friendly drug addicts helpfully directed Margaret to private homes to buy narcotics . She went to fancy midcity apartments and also to humble dwellings . Sometimes the sociability between undercover policewomen and their male quarries became too close for ladylike comfort . Several girls , acting their underworld roles realistically . were mistaken for prostitutes . An amorous dope addict with long sideburns cornered one of them in a second-story ' rear bedroom . The girl argued , fought  --  and finally jumped out of the back window , She landed on concrete twelve feet below . Picking herself up , she lied . The bewildered dope addict stared out of the window after her , but did not feel ardent enough to jump . Policewoman Geraldine Galcik , on the other hand , sometimes felt " over-protected . ' ' Gerry , self-reliant daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart Manhattan fashion salon , Slim and blond , she measures 32-2030 . Her blue eyes are merry , her smile quick , her mental reactions smooth as oiled steel . A former telephone operator and department-store detective , she now holds an odd record . She is the " most-arrested " policewoman on the force . She cart , of course , explain . " For my first ten months on duty , I served in uniform with the Juvenile Division . I worked in nearly every police district , and knew hundreds of patrolmen . That handicapped me later . In narcotics investigation , I posed as a poor little rich girl who had all that money could buy and was out for thrills . I dressed well and drove a brand-new sports couN . Naturally , I had to go into the worst neighborhoods to contact drug sellers . " Frequently I 'd be parked in some dim slum with just a pusher while I tried to persuade him to sell me the stuff . A patrolman , seeing what looked like a decent girl in a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers of Philadelphia to know this , but it was no help to me . " Often the patrolman would recognize Gerry from her Juvenile Division work . She would whisper , " Arrest me , quick , " Time and again , she and her companions were hauled into district stations and booked for investigation . The ease with which she talked herself free impressed the dope trade . On her first assignment , however , Gerry ' had a nerve-racking time . She was given only the approximate address and nickname of a big pusher in South Philadelphia and was sent out " cold " to locate him . " In my rich-girl role , I put on one of my best dresses and hoped nothing would happen to it . I had only a general idea of where I was going , but I knew it was n't a nice neighborhood . The man I was to find was both a junkie and a pusher , a nasty combination . He was a barber by trade , nicknamed Reds . I pulled up my car to a ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 102 ) barbershop in the vicinity , tooted the horn and called out for Reds . About five men came streaming out . Eventually I found out which one was Reds . I told him I wanted to buy some stuff . Beforehand , I had gone through the police files and memorized a few names of users in that neighborhood . When he asked s. ? , hat people I knew , I rattled off the names , meanwhile hoping and praying that none of them was standing around . Luck was with me . " What impressed Reds most , though , was my hairdo . He took a professional interest in the way it was cut short in front and waved in back . Then the subject of the conversation changed . I guess he liked a lot more about me than my hairdo . He insisted on getting into the car with me . What was Ito do ? ' Sure , get in , ' 1 said . We drove to six or seven addresses without getting the stuff . He was stalling me deliberately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , over and over , who I was , how 1 got my money , who 1 knew . The whole time I was petrified . " Finally Reds took her ten dollars and went into a house . Twenty-five long minutes later , he came out and handed her a bag of heroin . " I had made my first buy . Looking back , I guess the hardest part was waiting those twenty-five minutes to find out whether 1 had succeeded . " At times during investigations , Gerry 's parents never saw her for three days at a stretch . Occasionally whichever one sat up later would leave a little note stuck in the television screen : " Gerry got home last night . She 's O.K. " They worried , she says , but they never urged her to quit . Boy friends , however , created a real problem . " My best boy friend got so tired of my canceling dates that he broke off entirely , " she recalls . " He just got fed up with hearing me say : ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trust me . ' After the news of the raids revealed what I was doing , though , he sent me a big bunch of red roses and a note . Everything 's happy now . " An even crueler test of a woman 's ability to keep silent was endured by Gerry 's partner , Dorothy Garvin , not long after Dorothy was imprisoned overnight by the dope racketeers . Her ordeal required her to remain absolutely still while a heavy man stepped on her head . At the time , Dorothy was too widely known as a police agent to dare to show her face . But she sat in the back of Gerry 's sports coupe , with a bulky quilt handy for concealment , pointing out suspected pushers for Gerry to contact , Abruptly , Gerry heard herself hailed . Dorothy instantly recognized the man as a pusher and ducked under the quilt . Gerry parked . The man came over . So , suddenly , did two other men , his pals . Gerry , who has a flair for elementary mathematics , says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front seat of a coupe . Before I could say or do anything , a huge man with an enormous foot yanked open the back door and stepped right down on poor Dorothy 's head under the quilt . I began yelling and carrying on to get him away from the car before he put his other foot on what was left of her head . I pretended I 'd dropped some dope in the street . We hunted that . When we came back to the car , I told them I had chinaware wrapped in the quilt and that the ' big old clumsy ' had almost broken it . I talked enough to drive him away . The other two men got in front with inc . We drove and talked for an hour before I finally made a purchase and got rid of them . Then  --  and only then  --  was I able to see whether poor Dottie was still alive . She was . Through it all , she never even let out a sound . Later she joked , Mymother used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I know better . ' " Altogether , the undercover policewomen and men purchased illegal heroin more than 2000 times in a year and a half . Under the law , any trace of heroin hydrochloride in such a purchase constitutes acceptable evidence . With the evidence in hand , the district attorney 's office , headed consecutively by Dilworth , Samuel Dash and Victor H. Blanc , was enabled to draw up indictments even before the arrests . The culprits were rounded up in five sweeping raids in 1955 and 1956 . In mobilizing for one foray , the 160 patrolmen under Deputy Police Commissioner Albert N. Brown made their field headquarters in Convention Hall , the mammoth auditorium where Democratic and Republican national conventions have been held . As usual , the raiders surprised the sleeping dope pushers between three and four A.M. By dawn , the big hall held the most ill-tempered convention it ever had seen .

" Even some on whom we had nothing took fright and ran out , " Chief Detective McDermott reports . " Most , we believe , went to New York City , Chicago or Detroit . " Philadelphia 's general crime rate fell off 42 per cent in the half year of the first big raids . " While there will always be some dope sales and crime , " McDermott concludes , " our experience shows that if you control illegal narcotics , you can reduce the entire crime rate . " Narcotics and other forms of major crime proved to be thoroughly interlocked in an unholy alliance . The insistent urge to use drugs spurred junkies into other crimes to get the money . " One undercover man telephoned me one day in great concern , " McDermott says . " ' These junkies want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reported , ' They even offered to steal a car for me .

" An undercover policewoman , meeting an addict who explained he was " sick " ? the jargon for needing dope  --  walked with hint in West Philadelphia in search of a dope peddler . During the stroll , the addict took a small object from his pocket and methodically opened parking meters along four blocks of a main thoroughfare . Totting up his take , 56.80 , he crooned , " More than enough to buy a five-dollar bag . " Then he waved the small object . " Nice little key , " he crowed . The policewoman took a second look .
