The chemicals of discontent which are present throughout the whole Arab world exploded in a foreboding chain reaction last week in Jordan . The trigger was Britain 's attempt to bring Jordan into the anti-Communist Baghdad pact too fast ; the effect was a setback for the West . <P> Britain 's General Sir Gerald Templer , an able but not always tactful man , offered to increase Britain 's economic and military aid if only Jordan would sign . When he tried to bulldoze Jordan 's Premier , the Premier resigned ( TIME , Dec. 26 ) . Jordan 's young , Harrow-educated King Hussein quickly appointed a new government to accept Templer 's proposals , but already agitators were stirring . Ambitious King Saud of Saudi Arabia maintains scores of agents provacateurs to promote his influence in Jordan ; Communists , though small in number , know how to guide mobs . <P> Stoned to Death . In Jericho , 20,000 Arab refugees from Israel poured out of their dismally squalid camps and rampaged through a model-farm school , established for their benefit by U.S. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and killing or stealing 10,000 chickens and 3,000 turkeys . Next the mob burned down a warehouse containing $60,000 worth of clothing which an American Mennonite mission had planned to distribute to the refugees as gifts . In the little town of Bethlehem , usually host to thousands of Christian pilgrims at this season , another mob stormed a police station ; police and Arab legionnaires opened fire , killing six rioters . One legionnaire was stoned to death . <P> In alarm , King Hussein fired his new government just 72 hours after it had taken office , and dissolved Parliament . But instead of mollifying the rioters , his action seemed to embolden them . The U.S. consulate in the Jordanian half of Jerusalem was attacked for a second time in a week . The American flag was hauled down from a 30-ft. pole and trampled in the streets . Then the mob swarmed on the French consulate ; the consul held off the crowd with a submachine gun . At the Turkish consulate , a 14-year-old boy was killed in the garden , and a 16-year-old girl rioter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legion inside the building itself . <P> Hope Springs Eternal . Next day the King desperately recalled one of the nation 's elder statesmen , ex-Premier Ibrahim Hashim , 67 , to head a " caretaker " government , and promised an election within four months to decide whether to join the Baghdad pact . Then the King boarded his personal plane , circled over his capital city of Amman to watch the effect . Mobs continued marching through the streets , and by now professional porters were distributing stones from baskets on their backs . But by week 's end , the furor had abated , especially after the King freed 1,000 arrested rioters . The toll : at least 16 dead , more than 100 injured . <P> In London , a Foreign Office Under Secretary of State , Lord John Hope , told Parliament that " what is happening in Jordan will pass over , ' ' a remark that deserved the week 's prize for complacency in the face of peril . Pravda added its ruble 's worth : " The people of this small country have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperialistic colonizers . "
