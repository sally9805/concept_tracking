Death of a Patriot <P> SIr : <P> " He that findeth his life shall lose it , but he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it . " Robert Taft may have lost all his greatest battles , but in the losing he proved himself a man for the ages . . . <P> He was more than a great politician . He was a very great statesman and patriot . Your picture of him in the Aug. 10 issue on crutches is the saddest picture I have ever seen . . . <P> <P> JESSIE SPROAT CHAPMAN <P> Bethel , Me . <P> <P> Over the Wonderful Wahless <P> Sir : <P> Mr. Malcolm Muggeridge 's attack on so-called monopoly broadcasting in the Aug. 3 issue includes an attack on my work for the BBC which could be extremely misleading to your readers , since it is based on a grossly willful avoidance of the facts . . . " On the air , " he moans , " there are not other voices ... <P> I want others to be heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> full-time American correspondents , one at the <P> UN and two from Washington . . . The <P> BBC also airs a weekly 15-minute political <P> commentary ( called American Commentary ) ... <P> also a regular feature called Recorded in <P> ' New York , which gives absolutely free rein <P> to a wide variety of distinguished Americans . <P> Altogether , this service provides a far more <P> varied , responsible and serious coverage of <P> the U.S. than our combined networks do <P> about Britain for America . I come in once a <P> week with a 15-minute nonpolitical talk . . . <P> I confidently trust ... the Americans who <P> hear them rebroadcast over ABC to judge <P> far better than Mr. M. whether they make <P> up an " essentially misleading " picture of <P> American life . <P> To this self-denying John the Baptist , standing in the middle of Times Square and begging to be rescued from his wilderness , the only sensible answer seems to be : " Turn on your wahless , you damn fool . " <P> <P> ALISTAIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was rather disagreeably surprised that there was no reproduction of a Kokoschka ... in your Aug. 3 issue . Certainly it would have made the article still more interesting . <P> <P> Louis TAS Amsterdam , Holland <P> Herewith Expressionist Kokoschka 's 1937 self- " Portrait of a Degenerate Artist . " - ED . <P> <P> Morning into Day <P> Sir : <P> May I call your attention to an error in translation of Malay ... in which you state that Mata Hari means " eye of the morning . " Mata means " eye " and Hari is " day . " The two together , Mata-hari , are translated as " the sun , " or the " eye of day . " In similar fashion , Mata-sapi , literally a " cow 's eye , " means a fried egg . Incidentally , the Malay for morning is Pagi . . - <P> S.

Unshaken , the French marksmen never wavered-which may be attributed either to their splendid discipline or many evenings at the Folies . . . <P>
