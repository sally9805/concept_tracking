Esperanza enters with the coffee pot , pours his coffee . Estella follows her , climbing onto her father 's lap . &nbsp; LUISPapa . . . is there gon na be a strike ?

LONG ESTABLISHING SHOT This panorama should be as inclusive as the location site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt road . Beyond this elliptical picket line on either side of the road are two signs : DELAWARE ZINC CO. , INC . KEEP OUT MINERS ON STRIKE WE WANT EQUALITY Though the area is unfenced , these signs mark an imaginary boundary . But access to the mine is difficult except by way of the road . To the right of the road is a steep wooded hillside . The road skirts this hill till it reaches the mountain of waste in deep b.g. , then winds uphill to the knoll on which the mine stands . To the left of the road is a railroad spur and a gully . The gully is bridged by trestles , beyond which a fork of the road leads to Zinc Town . Two sheriff 's cars are parked on the road near the picket post . No women are visible in this scene . &nbsp; ESPERANZA 'S VOICEAnd so it began  --  much like any other strike .

Two open touring cars loaded with strike-breakers slowly approach the picket line . The lead car stops before this human wall .

We see the lead car make a U-turn and withdraw the way it came . It is followed by the second car . &nbsp; ESPERANZA 'S VOICEBut they usually lost their nerve when they saw the size of the picket line . ANOTHER ANGLE , FEATURING SHERIFF 'S CARS parked near the picket line . A half-dozen deputies stand around idly . They are khaki-clad , booted , wearing their Stetsons with the brims rolled up . They display their side-arms ostentatiously , their holsters hanging low in the fashion of storybook gunmen . &nbsp; ESPERANZA 'S VOICEThe Sheriff 's men were always there .

But the men only marched , day after day , week after week . . .  --  28  --  WIPE TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHOT , DAY Charley Vidal and another miner stand in the back of a pick-up , distributing rations to Esperanza and Luz Morales .

The union gave us rations and we had to figure out how to feed our families on them . . . EXT. , PICKET LINE . MEDIUM SHOT , DAY There are fewer pickets now , and the miners , weary of the monotony , march in a more leisurely fashion . We see Mrs. Salazar ( the old lady introduced at the maanita ) standing close by the picket line . She is crocheting . Ramn , the picket captain , and other miners glance uncomfortably at her . &nbsp; ESPERANZA 'S VOICEBut then one morning Mrs. Salazar went to the picket line .

He tastes it , makes a wry face . &nbsp; ESPERANZA 'S VOICEI did n't come to the lines at first . My time was near  --  and besides , Ramn did n't approve . But Ramn is a man who loves good coffee . And he swore the other ladies made it taste like zinc sludge . . . WIPE TO : MATCHING SHOT : THE COFFEE SHACK , FEATURING ESPERANZA .

Just negotiate . &nbsp; HARTWELL ( coolly , to Alexander ) Are we talking to a union spokesman ? &nbsp; ALEXANDERNot exactly . But I wish he were one . He knows more about mining than those pie-cards we 've had to deal with . Hartwell is unprepared for Alexander 's gambit  --  but a mask falls suddenly over Ramn 's face .

Ramn stands watching him . The deputies are almost on him before he turns . One of them seizes him by the arm . He appears to be protesting , but the men are out of ear-shot .

The Sheriff grins triumphantly and leaves , followed by his entourage . &nbsp; ESPERANZA 'S VOICEThe company had got a court injunction ordering the strikers to stop picketing . A Taft-Hartley injunction , they called it . It meant heavy fines and jail sentences for the strikers if they disobeyed . Sal rises slowly , re-reading the court order as Frank and Charley join him , reading over his shoulder .

Fight them all ! &nbsp; OTHER MINERSHow ? They 'll arrest us ! We gain nothing . Their voices fade . Ramn , still on his feet , turns on his critics , lashing them . Another miner rises , extending his arms in a gesture of helplessness . Over this we hear : &nbsp; ESPERANZA 'S VOICEThe men quarreled . They made brave speeches .

Brother Quintero was right when he said we 'll lose fifty years of gains if we lose this strike . Your wives and children too . But this we promise  --  if the women take your places on the picket line , the strike will not be broken , and no scabs will take your jobs .  --  53  --  There is silence in the hall now .

But you men are voting on something the women are to do , or not to do . So I think it 's only fair the women be allowed to vote  --  especially if they have to do the job .

LONG PANORAMIC SHOT , MORNING This panorama should be as sweeping a vista as the first scene of the picket line . We get the sense of women streaming toward the picket post from four points of the compass . Some arrive in ancient cars , others walk by way of the road or foot paths or the railroad tracks .

They are as bold and self-assured as two drill sergeants . Most of the women are dressed for the occasion  --  wearing shirts , jeans and sneakers or saddle shoes . &nbsp; ESPERANZA 'S VOICEBy sun-up there were a hundred on the line . And they kept coming -- women we had never seen before , women who had nothing to do with the strike . Somehow they heard about a women 's picket line  --  and they came .
