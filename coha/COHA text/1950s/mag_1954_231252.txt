Should stringent restrictions be placed on newspaper coverage of court trials ? Many a lawyer thinks so and strict codes for covering trials have even been proposed ( TIME , July 12 ) . But last week in Washington , before the Federal Bar Association , Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr . vigorously denied that newspapers should be hamstrung in their trial coverage . Said Brownell : " Our free press brings to light corruption , injustice , dishonesty , wrongs of every kind . . . The free press may also be helpful to an accused in dispelling false , distorted or wild charges that would otherwise provoke hasty and irresponsible vigilante action . " Brownell pointed out that the press has been guilty at times of standing in the way of justice by subverting " the process of impartial and orderly decision " or by influencing a judge or jury " before they have reached their own independent judgment . " As a result , he approves of voluntary agreements between lawyers , court officials and newspapers that would help raise the level of court reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , " concluded Brownell , " the chief responsibility for securing fair and impartial trials can not be shifted to the press . It must of necessity rest upon the members of the bar and other officers of the court . More than 20 years ago a writer on the subject said : ' Except for the slush and gush of the sob artists , there is very little offense chargeable against the press in which it is not led or abetted by lawyers , judges and other public officers .
