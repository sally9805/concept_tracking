In the radio-TV room of the White House last August , a group of photographers hurriedly shot pictures of the President as he prepared to broadcast a report to the nation . Among them was George Tames , 35 , New York Times Magazine photographer . Only one of his three dozen shots of Ike was printed , the rest went into the paper 's picture morgue . Recently , Photographer Tames entered his best picture in the White House News Photographers ' Association annual contest , in which he has already won close to a dozen prizes . But Ike saw a print first , commented : " That 's me . " This week the Times Magazine ran the picture on its front cover ( see cut ) , announced that the White House had asked permission to use it as the " official Eisenhower portrait , " which the President autographs and gives to visitors , friends and others who ask for a picture . At Ike 's request , the portrait was not retouched.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
