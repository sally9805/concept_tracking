PRESIDENT EISENHOWER spoke to the United Nations Assembly in the spirit of a man searching for peace . His manner was mod ? erate , his approach was charitable , his conclusion was hopeful . The world is in need of these qualities after years of tension and . violence . So the response of most non-Communist nations was kindly . Even the Kremlin , while it treated the President 's review of atomic weapons as a threat rather than as a plea , promised to study the new plan . But what is it that the Kremlin is asked to study ? The President presented to the United Nations a " new con ? ception " for the control and development of atomic energy . This " new conception " in contrast to the Presi ? dent 's general manner must be considered in the specific and ambitious terms in which ' it is presented . It is the first major proposal in world affairs originating with the Eisenhower Administration . It is a declaration of policy by the leader of the non-Communist nations on the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alter ? native to the atomic arms race . And already this nation has greeted it as a plan for peace . If the Kremlin turns it down , then that will be further proof of its wickedness . ? Does the President 's plan bear analysis in these terms ? If it is analyzed as policy rather than propaganda , if it is reviewed in the concrete terms as they are presented to the Kremlin , it seems probable that the " new concep ? tion " may do more harm than good , in ignoring harsh realities , raising false hopes and introducing new risks . Why A " New Conception " ? It is entirely unclear whether the President 's new conception is offered as an addition to the old conception , or in its place . While the President does not repudiate previous plans , he ignores them and implies that they are obsolete . The term " new conception " suggests that we are starting over . But the " old conception " is not ours to discard . It is the Majority Plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central stand of the Western World on the great issue of peace . ? The great assumption of the United States and the UN majority has been their understanding that war has be ? come too costly to be entrusted to the whims , errors and ambitions of ' sovereign states . Our great stand has been the commitment to prohibit war by enforceable disarma ? ment in weapons of mass destruction . When the most terrible of these weapons was devel aped by the US , we held to our commitment , offering to surrender sovereignty over atomic energy to a wcfria au ? thority . In this , all technicalities apart , we cut through to the essential truth that , at a time when warfare can destroy mankind , no nation can long be permitted the power to wage atomic war . Seven years have eaten away at the political basis of the Majority Plan , but they have not diminished the brilliance of vision and the soundness of fundamental approach of the authors of the Majority Plan . They understood that atomic energy represented a twin challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of safeguards built around . . . hopeful prospects . " They realized that the US monopoly of atomic weapons was a wasting asset and that time was of the utmost urgency in seeking an enforceable agreement . They were fully aware of the promise of atomic power , ( in fact they may be criticized for over-emphasizing its promise ) . They affirmed correctly that because the threat outweighed the promise in today 's world , ' the develop ? ment of atomic power must be a part of a larger plan . They concluded that a fool-proof control system was vital . In explaining why enforceable inspection in itself was inadequate , the authors of the Acheson-Lilien ? thal Report stated for all time why anything less than enforceable inspection may be fatal : National rivalries in the development of atomic energy readily convertible to destructive purposes are the heart of the difficulty . So long as intrinsically dangerous activities may be carried on by nations , rivalries are inevitable and fears are engendered that place so great a pressure upon a system of international enforcement by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical competence could possibly hope to cope with them . These were the goals set forth by the Majority Plan , and as goals they surely stand . The means chosen to reach these goals proved faulty , particularly when they were rough-hewed by Mr. Baruch . Ttie substantial in centives that were offered to the Kremlin proved insuf ? ficient even when the regime was *eakest , perhaps because the Kremlin understood that time was on its side . In four years of negotiations , concessions were made by both sides , new problems were brought into focus , progress was made until , at the end , the margin of dif ? ference at the technical level was narrow . The negotia ? tions collapsed because while technical disagreements were narrowing political disagreements were growing wider . As they widened it became increasingly unreal istic to suppose that either side would relinquish to the other its most valued secrets or its most cherished wea ? pons . The incentives offered to the Kremlin to accept the Majority Plan diminished as it developed its own store of secrets and bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1948 : There appears to be little doubt that at the present time our unique possession of the facilities and weapons of atomic energy constitutes military advantages which we only reluctantly would lay down . There was a chance that had the Russians accepted the Majority Plan in 1946 our Congress would have fol ? lowed suit . By 1951 the Plan was as unacceptable to the Congress and the Pentagon as it was to the Russians . In this sense our adherence to the Plan became hypocrisy , and the Plan itself became a fiction with all the encum ? brances that fictions carry in international relations . The remedy surely was not to turn from the Plan 's central truths for political considerations , but to create the polit ? ical climate in which the validity of these truths could be reaffirmed . President Truman rightly reopened the issue of methods of progress while adhering to the basic prin ? ciple that peace demanded universal and enforceable dis ? armament . This stand was reasserted by President Eisen ? hower in his April 16 speech . What remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we repeat , has not openly repudiated the past . But the principal contribution of the " new conception " in the minds of experts is that it has finally buried the Majority Plan . If this is true , is the President right ? No one will propose that we should drown , clutching to a life raft that has become waterlogged . Should we then abandon the one life raft we possess to strike out alone , into a darkness where no other life raft can be seen ? The principal author of the Majority Plan , Dr. Oppen ? heimer , has stated of a world control system : " It is not beyond human ingenuity to invent new proposals . " If this is true , if it is even arguable , then this is the prob ? lem which the United States must face ! The way to face it is the way taken by President Truman in 1946 . First he called together this country 's allies to formulate a common approach in terms of basic principles . Then he assigned a commission of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these principles into a plan . President Eisenhower , in contrast , acted alone , presenting his plan to the Premier of France and the Prime Minister of Great Britain in the form of a speech to be delivered two days later . The plan itself was the product , not of scientists , diplomats , military experts and industrialists ( as in the case . of the Acheson-Lilienthal Report ) , but of speech writers and experts in psychologi ? cal warfare . ( Its principal author was Mr. C. D. Jackson . ) The Pooling of Fissionable Material In his speech to the UN the President began with a review of the " dark chamber of horrors . " He said : " atomic bombs today are more than 25 times as powerful as the weapons with which the atomic age dawned . " These bombs , in turn , he might have , added , are triggers for the far more destructive hydrogen bombs . The pres ? ent US stockpile , the President asserted , is many times " the explosive equivalent of the total of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every gun in every theatre of war all through the years of World War II . " The President went on to emphasize two facts , terrible for the United States : First , the knowledge now possessed by four nations will be eventually shared by others , perhaps all others . Second , even a vast superiority in numbers of wea ? pons and a consequent capability of devastating retalia ? tion is no preventive , of itself , , against the fearful material damage and toll of human lives that would be inflicted by surprise aggression . With these essential points , the President set the stage for the most drastic proposals . But what followed ? The President proposed that the United Nations create an agency to impound , store and protect fissionable mate ? rial transferred to it by member nations . He proposed further that this agency provide this fis ? sionable material as fuel for atomic power plants in areas now starved of power . Since control is incomparably the more important , it should be considered first . The " great virtue " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President declares , is that it does not propose to create " a system of inspection and con ? trol . " This amounts to asserting that the plan solves the control problem by wholly ignoring it . As the Russian experts pore over this point , they may discern three hints of advance of the problem of control . First , the interchange of nuclear scientists and engi ? neers for peacetime pursuits will reveal intelligence about each other 's weapons . Second , the UN pool of fissionable material for atomic power plants will exert a " pull " on the national stock ? piles of fissionable material set aside for weapons . Third , if we can co-operate with the Russians on simple tasks , perhaps we can move on , through force of habit , to more difficult problems . The paranoical Russians are not , of course , unaware of the fitst point . The second point seems equally illusory . If the US should provide enough fuel for four power plants of 100,000 kilowatts apiece , this would divert 300 pounds of fissionable material which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The production of nuclear energy , after all , is the largest industry in the United States , soon to consume 10 percent of all the electricity we produce . Before long we will have a surplus of fis ? sionable material as military needs reach saturation point . To suppose that the diversion of fissionable material to build power plants overseas will ? seriously eat into our output , let alone our stockpile , is fanciful . No greater " pull " will be exerted on the Kremlin since the ratio of the production schedules of each nation to its contribu ? tions are presumably to be the same . The third argument , that co-operation may be habit-forming , lacks supporting evidence in the post-war years . Behind it lies the notion that if an American can just talk man-to-man with a Russian , eventually he will see it our way . This assumes that the Russians do not com ? prehend their own self-interest , that the course taken by the Soviet state is susceptible of alteration through cama ? raderie among a few men and that Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of backward peoples . All three assumptions strike us as highly senti ? mental . If the Kremlin decides for its own reasons to provide atomic fuel for Pakistan , the fuel will be marked Courtesy of the Kremlin and not Property of the UN . If the control problem is to be approached in the spirit of a modest beginning ? why not accept the Soviet pro ? posals on control ? They are inadequate and illusory , but they offer much more security than is offered by a con ? centration of fissionable material in a vault marked UN . The Provision of Atomic Power The President himself attaches greater importance to the development aspect of his " new conception . " By providing nuclear fuel to power-starved areas , " the con ? tributing powers would be dedicating some of their strength to serve the needs rather than the fears of man ? kind . " This proposal does attempt to meet some present prob ? lems ? the determination of European nations to build atomic plants ; the desire of backward areas , rich in ura ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking from them ; the impending surplus of fissionable material in the United States , and the desire of the US to remain pre ? eminent in the field of nuclear energy . Granted all this , does the plan offer a basis for meeting the world 's needs and allaying its fears ? The President proposes to provide fuel for atomic power plants to power-hungry areas ? fuel they could not otherwise obtain . But fuel is only one element in the cost of atomic power . Equally important is the capital cost . A conventional steam plant costs about $150 to $200 per kilowatt to build ; an atomic plant about $300 . Larger plants of course are more efficient . But large markets are not characteristic of power-starved areas . For the nations of Western Europe , atomic power is not economical today . These nations want atomic power because they lack the foreign exchange to import coal and oil . They are already preparing to build atomic plants and to produce atomic fuel , and they will not wel ? come the suggestion that both fuel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency which includes Soviet accountants and engineers . In contrast , the impoverished areas , such as Pakistan and Brazil , where the cost of coal and fuel is so high as to make atomic power worthwhile , lack the capital to build atomic power plants . Nor can we provide these plants in any numbers for the next 10 years . We are just'beginning to build our first pilot plant for power . The time required , according to one expert , to build plants overseas is two years of talk and three years of hard work . The end result will be a plant that is nowhere much cheaper than a conventional steam plant . No one in the Eisenhower Administration is talking of building steam plants and providing coal for the power-starved areas of the world . Is it wiser to talk then of providing them today with plants that can maintain or breed the raw material of atomic devastation ? Should we for the sake of minor savings in electricity give to Argentina , Spain or Formosa the material that can touch off a third world war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wage atomic war is one in which the benefits of atomic power can be realized . But the world envisioned by the President is one in which significant amounts of fission ? able material are held by any number of nations includ ? ing a revivified Germany and Japan , although these na ? tions retain the power to wage atomic war . The capacity of this world for self destruction is so great as to be almost beyond hope . For these reasons the President 's plan seems to us to be potentially very dangerous . To assert this is not to include that it not accomplish the President 's highest hopes . Its future rests entirely on what the Kremlin chooses to make of it . If for its own reasons unrelated to the plan , the Kremlin decides that it is in its benefit to seek a basis for peace , then the plan may lead to con ? structive developments . In that case , it will be less a basis than an excuse for serious negotiations . If , as seems more probable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of peace , to create the il ? lusion of peace , then it may greet the President 's " new conception " with enthusiasm . In this case , the Kremlin will retain intact its power to devastate the free nations while they , supposing that the Eisenhower plan offers some magic , hoped-for security , will falter in the pre ? paredness which peace demands in a world without control . The enormity of existing stockpiles of atomic weapons , the determination of many nations to produce fissionable material , the growing impetus given day by day to sur ? prise attacks give rise to new tensions which minor offsets , and good works will not overcome . They demand bold ? ness and courage , as well as charity and restraint . The President 's intentions are splendid . He has , in his con ? cept of a UN authority that would license and fuel the world 's atomic power plants , the germ of an idea which though not new could be fruitful as part of a larger plan .. The absence of a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. Nor is this the President 's fault . His confusion is the product of the intellectual poverty created by eight years of secrecy in a nation whose way is found in freedom of debate . The President 's " new conception " is neither new nor a conception ; but until the President provides the American people with the facts , they will find it hard to prepare a better plan ..
