For more than 13 years , the New York Police Department and the Communist Party have been secretly and successfully planting spies in the innermost echelons of each other 's organizations . They have engaged not only in mutual theft of all kinds of information , but also in a never-ending game of blindman 's buff calculated to ferret out the opposition 's operatives . The details of this undercover competition became public for the first time last week , as the department prosecuted one of the Communists ' most successful plants -a 42-year-old lieutenant named Arthur Miller , who has spent 16 years on the force and , before being unmasked , stood 16th among 633 officers in line for promotion to captain . <P> The tale of the department 's Special Squad No. 1 , a group which was ordered to infiltrate the party back during World War II , came to light when a secret report to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was made public during Miller 's trial . The report , dated April 4 , 1944 , noted that 28 detectives and policewomen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports on its inner workings . " So deeply did some of our investigators bore into the party , " it stated , " that one of them acted as a courier between the American Communist Party and an agent in Portugal ... " <P> The Communists ' parallel activities were disclosed when one John Lautner , former security chief for the New York State Communist Party , took the stand for the prosecution . The police had wondered for years how twelve of their 28 World War II spies were discovered and thrown out of the party . The Communist informant , said Lautner , was Lieut . Miller , who joined the force in May 1937 , and faithfully sent the party inside information . After he reported that the anti-Communist squad was being formed , the Communists managed to get four police-department members assigned to it . <P> In 1949 , however , Miller asked Lautner to let him resign from the force : he had been suspected of Communist activity , had been shunted to a harmless police post near Prospect Park . Brooklyn , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to let him quit : if New York 's Communist-dominated American Labor Party gained more political power . Miller might well have become police commissioner . The Communist lieutenant accepted the verdict , stayed faithfully on duty until the department finally gathered enough solid evidence to cite him for trial . But Miller disappeared in a flash after that , and last week 's proceedings ( which resulted in his dismissal from the force ) were conducted with the defendant 's chair empty . <P> As the case against Miller drew to its close , the department announced that it was investigating 15 more officers , one of them an old-hand woman detective , who were also suspected of being Communists . The cops and the comrades , it seemed obvious , were still spying on each other as busily as ever .
