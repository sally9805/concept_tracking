Life 's biggest moment came for Ed McCarthy last year before the television cameras at the Republican National Convention in San Francisco . As a longtime Republican , a hard-working precinct worker , an alternate delegate to the convention-and a member in good standing of the United Steelworkers-Ed was picked out of the crowd to second the nomination of Dwight Eisenhower for President . <P> McCarthy was a hero of sorts when he got back home to Providence . At the station was a happy welcoming crowd of Republicans . Then he looked again . There was also a second welcoming committee made up of steelworkers carrying Democratic placards condemning Unionman McCarthy for his Republican stand . Ikeman McCarthy followed through , stumped for Ike for five weeks . After the election he settled down once again to his job as an electric-furnace-control man in the Dart Union Co. pipefitting factory , cherished a personal note of thanks from the President of the U.S. , laughed off continued razzing from fellow union members . <P> Last spring McCarthy heard that there was an opening in Providence for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application and shipped it out . Sure enough , party men at the state level as well as those in Washington , D.C. remembered Steelworker McCarthy . This week , upon appointment by the President , Ed McCarthy , 47 , quit his $5,000-a-year job at the plant and was sworn in as the $7,500-a-year Marshal of the Federal District Court , Rhode Island .
