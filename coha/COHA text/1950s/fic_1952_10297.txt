soon as they passed the entrance the midshipmen dispersed , laughing and shouting , to the staircases . Willie remained in the lobby , staring uneasily at faded Columbia athletic trophies in glass cases . He allowed fifteen minutes to pass , wandering here and there , keeping out of sight of the officer and midshipmen guarding the quarterdeck . The excitement of the review dissipated . The lobby became quiet . He screwed up his courage , and walked briskly toward the one guarded door . All the other exits were locked and bolted . " Halt ! Sound off . " Willie drew up at the summons of the officer of the day , a burly midshipman wearing a yellow armband . A few feet away an ensign sat at a desk marking examination papers . " Midshipman Willis Seward Keith , Furnald , on official business . " " State business . " " Checking on a lost custody card of a rifle . " The OOD picked up a clipboard with a mimeographed form sheet on it . " You 're not logged in , Keith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the review . Sorry . " " Show your business pass . " This was the spring of the trap . Willie cursed Navy thoroughness . He pulled out his wallet and showed the OOD a picture of May Wynn waving and smiling on a merry-go-round horse . " Take it from here , friend , " he whispered . " If you want , I bilge . " The OOD 's eyes widened in amazement . He looked sidelong at the ensign , then straightened and saluted . " Pass , Keith . " " Aye aye , sir . " Willie saluted and emerged into the sunlight , through the one loophole that military wisdom can never quite button up  --  the sympathy of the downtrodden for each other . There were three ways back to Furnald : across the field , which was too exposed ; a sneak trip around through the streets , which were out of bounds ; and the gravel path along the field in front of the library . Willie took the gravel path , and soon came upon a working party of Furnald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the admiral 's party on the library steps . He briefly consideredmingling with them , but they wore khaki , and they gave him queer scared looks . He hurried by them . The path lay clear ahead to Furnald --  " Midshipman Keith , I believe ? " Willie spun around in unbelieving horror at the tones . Ensign Brain , concealed by a granite post at the library entrance , was seated on a yellow chair , smoking . He dropped the cigarette , ground it out daintily with his toe , and rose . " Any explanation , Midshipman Keith , for being 40outside your room and wandering around out of uniform during a study hour ? " All Willie 's resolve and intention caved in . " No , sir . " " No , sir . An excellent answer , Midshipman Keith , making up in clarity for what it lacks in official acceptability . " Ensign Brain smiled like a hungry man at the sight of a chicken leg . " Midshipman Auerbach , you will take charge of the working party . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , Midshipman Keith . " " Aye aye , sir . " Willie got back into Furnald Hall with no trouble , under the escort of Ensign Brain . He was marched to the desk of the duty officer , Ensign Acres . The midshipmen on the quarterdeck regarded him with pale dismay . Word of his pile of demerits had spread through the school . This new disaster horrified them . Willie Keith was all their nightmares come to life . " Holy cow , " exclaimed Ensign Acres , standing , " not Keith again . " " The same , " said Ensign Brain . " The same paragon of military virtue , Midshipman Keith . Out of uniform , absent without leave , and violating a study period . No explanation . ' " This is the end of him , " said Acres . " No doubt . I 'm sorry for him , but obviously I had to pick him up . " " Of course . " Acres regarded Willie curiously , and with some pity . " Do n't you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . I 've had a bad run of luck , sir . " Acres lifted his hat , scratched his head with the same hand , and looked doubtfully at Brain . " Maybe we ought to just kick his behind up nine flights of stairs . " " You 're the duty officer , " said Brain virtuously A couple of dozen midshipmen know of this already For all I know the exec saw the whole business through his window ' Acres nodded , and squared his hat as Brain walked off . " Well , this does it , Keith . Come along . " They paused outside the exec 's door . Acres said in a low voice , " Betweenyou and me , Keith , what the hell happened ? " The uniforms of both young men seemed to fade away for the moment , in the friendliness of Acres ' tone Willie had a sudden flooding sense that this was all just a dream in Looking-glass Land , that he still had his health , that the sun still shone , and that outside Furnald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his predicament would seem a joke There was just this one difficulty : he was inside Furnald Hall . Enmeshedin comic-opera laws , he had comically broken a few , and was41going to a comic-opera doom . But this dance of nonsense impinged very strongly on the real world . It meant that in time his living body , instead of being carted across the Pacific , clad in blue , would be carted across the Atlantic , clad in brown . This fact bothered him violently . " What 's the difference ? " he said . " It was nice knowing you , Acres . " Ensign Acres let the familiarity pass . He understood it . " Merton has a heart . Tell him the truth . You have a chance , " he said as he knocked . Commander Merton , a little round-headed man with bristling brown hair and a red face , sat at his desk facing the door . He was partly hidden by a bubbling Silex . " Yes , Acres ? " " Sir  --  Midshipman Keith again . " Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good God . What now ? " Acres recited the indictment . Merton nodded , dismissed him , locked the door , and flipped a key on his interoffice talkbox . " I do n't want any calls or other interruptions until further notice . " " Aye aye , sir , " rattled the box . The commander filled a cup . " Coffee , Keith ? " " No , thank you , sir . " Willie 's knees were unsteady . " I think you 'd better have some . Cream or sugar ? " " Neither , sir . " " Sit down . " " Thank you , sir . " Willie was more scared by the courtesy than he would have been by rage . There was an air about the coffee of a condemnedman 's last meal . Commander Merton sipped in silence for endless minutes . He was a reserve officer , in peacetime an insurance sales manager with a fondness for boating and for the weekly reserve drills . His wife had complained often of the time he wasted on the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone into active service at once and his family was proud now of his three stripes . " Keith , " he said at last , " you put me into the peculiar position of wanting to apologize to you for the Navy 's laws . The sum of demerits for your three new offenses , together with the twenty-five you have , puts you out of school . " " I know , sir . " " Those demerits make sense . The values were carefully weighed . Any man who ca n't stay within the bounds of those penalties should n't be in the Navy . " " I know , sir . " " Unless , " said the commander , and sipped for a while , " unless extraordinary , once-in-a-million circumstances are involved . Keith , what 's been happening to you ? " There was nothing to lose . Willie poured out the tale of his troubles with May Wynn , including her appearance outside the fence . The exec listened unsmilingly . When the story was done , he pressed his fingertips together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of temporary derangement due to a girl . " " Yes , sir . But my fault , not hers . " " Are n't you the boy , " said Commander Merton , " who wrote the brilliantessay on the Frictionless Bearing ? " " Well  --  yes , sir . " " That was a brutal essay question , designed to knock out all but the best . The Navy ca n't afford , Keith , to lose a man with such a mind . You 've done us a bad turn . " Willie 's hopes , which had risen slightly , fell again . " Supposing , " said Commander Merton , " that I were to give you a total of forty-eight demerits and confine you to the school until graduation . Could you make the grade ? " " I 'd like to try , sir ! " " Any offense would put you out- shoeshine , haircut , mussed bed . You 'd live with your head on a chopping block . Any bad luck would sink you  --  even the day before graduation I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would n't have an evening with this girl , Miss Wynn , for three months . Are you sure you want to tackle such an ordeal ? " " Yes , sir . " " Why ? " Willie thought a moment Why , really ? Even transfer to the Army seemed a relief in comparison , after all . " I 've never failed anything I 've tried yet , sir , " he said . " I 've never tried to do much , that 's true . If I 'm no good I might as well find it out now . ' " Very well , get on your feet . " Willie jumped to stiff attention The movement brought him back into the Navy . " Twenty-three demerits and confined till graduation , " snapped CommanderMerton , in dry , bitter tones . " Thank you , sir ! " Dismissed . " Willie came out of the office full of resolution . He felt in debt to Commander Merton . His roommates respected his silence when he returned to the tenth floor . He flung himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote a long letter to May . He promised that at the end of his imprisonment his first act would be to seek her , if she still wanted to see him . He said nothing about marriage . Next morning hegot up with Keggs two hours before reveille and ground fanatically at ordnance , tactics , gunnery , navigation , and communications . There was a visiting time each day between five and five-thirty , when midshipmen could talk with parents or sweethearts in the lobby or on the walk in front of the hall . Willie intended to study through it , but came downstairs to buy cigarettes at the vending machine . He was surprised to see his father seated in a corner of a leather-covered sofa , the cane resting across his knees , his head leaning wearily on an arm , his eyes closed . " Hello , Dad ! " Dr. Keith opened his eyes and greeted Willie cheerfully , dispelling the picture of fatigue . " Where 's Mom ? " " She had a patrons ' meeting at the museum . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , Willie , but here I am . " " Thanks for coming , Dad . How 's your toe ? " " The same --  So , this is the good ship Furnald --  " " Let 's walk around . I 'll show you the place . " ' No . Just sit and talk . Tell me about it . ' Willie explained the use of the alphabet flags hanging from the ceiling , rattled off his store of nautical language to describe the massive anchoring tackle laid out in a corner , and explained the workings of the five-inch gun decorating the middle of the lobby Dr. Keith smiled and nodded . " You 're learning fast . " " It 's just a lot of talk , really , Dad . I 'll be lost on a ship . " " Not as much as you think . How are things going ? " Willie hesitated . He felt glad of the chance to break the bad news to his father , rather than to his mother . He could not guess how she would receive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He sketched his situation , keeping May 's part in it brief . Dr. Keith lit a cigar , and watched Willie as though his son 's face told him more than the words . " Pretty bad spot . " " Bad enough . " " Do you think you 'll make it ? " " If it 's in me , I will . I used to think I was pretty sharp . Now I 'm not sure what stuff I 've got . I 'm more curious than worried . " " Do you care about becoming a naval officer ? " " I guess so . I ca n't see myself as a new John Paul Jones , but I 'd hate to be licked in this silly way . " " Did your mother tell you about Uncle Lloyd ? " " What about him ? " " His partner has gone into the Army as a colonel . Public Relations . Lloyd is almost sure they can pull you out of the Navy and get you an Army commission . Your mother has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy . " " I did n't know . " " It came up over the week end . You know your mother . She 'll want to work it all out and hand it to you on a plate . " Willie glanced out through the window . Midshipmen were lounging in front of the building in the sunshine . " Could I still get an Army commission if I bilged ? " " I gather that it would n't make much difference . It might even expedite matters . " " Will you do me a favor , Dad ? " " Of course . " " Tell Mom , as nicely as you can , to call off Uncle Lloyd . " " Do n't be hasty . " " That 's what I want , Dad . " ' We can always keep it in reserve , you know . " " No , thanks . " " I doubt very much you 'd go overseas in that billet . " " I wish to hell I 'd known about it sooner . " " Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Willie . " " If I bilge , " said Willie , " I 'll enlist as a sailor . " He had formed no such resolve . The words came to his tongue . The gong clanged . Dr. Keith looked around and saw other visitors moving to the door . He rose awkwardly , leaning on the cane . His movements gave Willie a twinge of anxiety " You 're not in good shape , are you ? " " I 'll live , " laughed the doctor . He took Willie 's arm , but did n't lean on it , merely holding it as they walked to the entrance . " Well , farewell to the prisoner of Furnald . I 'll break it to your mother as gently as possible . " " She can still visit me here . I hope you will , too . " " I ca n't help saying , " Dr. Keith remarked , stopping at the door , " that your devotion to the Navy surprises me . " " I 'm not devoted to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me a lot of rubbish . The rules , the lingo , strike me as comical . The idea of men spending their lives in this make-believe appalls me . I used to think it was preferable to the Army , but I 'm sure now that they 're both the same kind of foolishness . I do n't care . I picked the Navy . I 'll see this stupid war through in the Navy . " " Do you need any money ? " Willie smiled ruefully . " Cigarettes are cheap here . No tax . " The doctor put out his hand . " Good-by , Willie . " He held his son 's gripa little longer than necessary . " Much of what you say about the Navy is probably true . But I wish I were one of your roommates . " His son grinned , surprised . " Be nice to have you here . But you 're doing more for the war in Manhasset . " " I 'm compelled to try to think so . Good-by . " Willie looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have talked more with his father before the war . In the weeks that followed May came often to visit him . She was contrite and cheerful . With simple tact she found out when his mother was likely to come , and stayed away on those days . Twice Willie saw her come to the entrance of Furnald , observe him talking to his mother , and depart with a discreet wave . In February her visits became less frequent ; she enrolled in Hunter College , and had several late classes . But sometimes she cut these to come to him . Willie was uneasy about her return to school , but she laughed at him . " Do n't worry , dear , all that is finished . I 'm not doing this for you , but for me . You 've had one good effect on me . I 've decided I 'd rather not be an ignorant canary all my life . " Willie stuck to his resolve to improve his shaky position with high marks , and he rose gradually to a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of fiery determination he had set his goal at Number One , but he soon saw that that would be denied him . A mandarin-like midshipman named Tobit , with a domed forehead , measured quiet speech , and a mind like a sponge , was ahead of the field by a spacious percentage . Bunched behind him were three other masterminds . Willie could n't compete with their weird photographic registry of print ; he soon realized this , and stopped despairing at marks which fell short of perfect . He drudged away in the niche that he found , varying between eighteenth and twenty-third in Furnald . His struggle against odds was notorious . The midshipmen and even the ensigns were fond of telling their girls about the unhappy devil carrying forty-eight demerits . This celebrity was useful to Willie . No ensign , not even the punctilious Brain , wanted to be the one to drop the guillotine on him . Once Acres came into the room during a study period and found Willie collapsed in sleep over the desk , a plain case costing eight demerits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never reported . Mrs. Keith was outraged at Willie 's position and violently sympathetic . She spent several visiting periods urging Willie to accept Uncle Lloyd 's Army commission , but she gave up at last when she saw that Willie was evidently winning his battle and taking deep satisfaction in it . In the last weeks , Willie faltered , partly from numb fatigue , partlyfrom a sense that the danger was passing . When the final standings were posted , four days before graduation , he had dropped to the thirty-first place . That same day a sensational document appeared on the bulletin board : a list of the types of duty open to graduates of Furnald . When the midshipmen returned to their rooms after morning classes they found mimeographed forms on their cots . Each midshipman was asked to list the three types of duty he most desired , and to state the reasons for his first choice . Nobody could find out how heavily these sheets would count in deciding orders . There were rumors that everyone would get his first choice if the reasons were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more meaningless Navy paper ; still other darker rumors , the more believed for their pessimism , that the purpose was simply to trap those who wanted to avoid dangerous duty , in order to make sure they got it . Some advised asking for the riskiest duty ; others were for putting down frankly the desires of the heart . Men like Willie , known for a gift of words , were pressed into service to write convincing reasons wholesale . An enterprising ex-newspaperman named McCutcheon on the eighth floor enjoyed a burst of prosperity by charging five dollars per reason . Keefer instantly chose Staff Duty , Pacific , saying , " That 's for me . Laying around on your duff in Hawaii , with all them nurses around , maybe running to get the admiral a despatch once in a while . That 's my kind of war . " He daringly left blank the other choices . Keggs agonized over the blank sheet for an hour and at last filled it in with a shaking hand . His first choice was Mine Disposal Training , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his sheet at all . Next he chose Submarines , Pacific  --  and third , in small letters , he wrote his true choice , Local Defense , Atlantic . Willie 's one aim in filling out the form was to remain near May . First he placed Staff , Atlantic , calculating that this must land him on the East Coast , possibly even in New York . Next he put Large Ships , Atlantic ( large ships spent a lot of time in port ) . Last he wrote Submarines , Pacific , to show that he was really a daredevil at heart . This last touch was admired on the tenth floor and much imitated . Willie himself thought that his list showed an incisive knowledge of Navy mentality . For a while he was tempted to apply for communications school , a five-month course at Annapolis . Keefer had a brother , Tom , who had attended the school and enjoyed a wild time with the Baltimoregirls . But it seemed to Willie that asking outright for half a year more of shore duty would show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after requesting an aircraft carrier . When Willie found that out , it decided him against listing the school. 46 47the Navy had to offer . He pitied Keggs . All up and down the floor shouts were being exchanged . Most of the men had received their first preferences . Those who had been honest rejoiced ; the others sulked or shivered . Willie was annoyed to learn that everyone who had asked for communications school , even as third choice , had been sent there . He had missed a chance . But Staff , Atlantic , was fair enough . The mate of the deck appeared in the doorway . " Here 's yours , Keith . Just came up . " Willie opened the envelope with a thrust of his forefinger and yanked out the sheaf of papers . His eye darted to the third paragraph . The words seemed to rise up at him with a sound of trumpets : Report to Receiving Station , San Francisco , for transportation toDMS 22  --  U.S.S. CAINE . Graduation was one day off , and during a study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying out to the last the pretense of work though the marks were all totaled and nothing counted any more . A word crackled down the corridor like a spark . " Orders ! " The midshipmen crowded to their doors . Down the hall came the mate of the deck with a bundle of envelopes . He came to 1013 and thrust two envelopes into Keefer 's hand . " Good luck , mates . " " Hey , " said Keefer , " there 's three guys in here . " The messenger riffled through his bundle . " Sorry . Guess Keith 's orders are held up . There 's another batch coming . " Keefer ripped open his envelope , burst into a cheer , and danced . " Made it ! Made it ! Staff , Pacific , by Christ ! " Willie pounded his back in congratulation . All at once Keefer sobered , and pulled himself out of the hug . " Hey , Ed  --  what the Shinola 's eating you ? " The horse face was leaning against the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His envelope lay on the desk . " What did you draw , Eddy ? " said Willie anxiously . " Dunn . I  --  I ca n't open it , fellows . " He was staring at the envelope as though it were a live mine . Keefer snorted . " Want me to ? " " Please . " The Southerner rasped it open and read the orders . " Jesus , " he murmured . Keggs fell on his cot with his face to the wall , groaning . " For God 's sake , " said Willie , " what is it ? " " Report to San Francisco for transportation to DMS 21  --  U.S.S. Moulton . ' " Keggs sat up . " A ship ? A ship ? Not Mine Disposal  --  a ship ? " " A ship , " said Keefer . " Now what is a DMS ? " " Who cares ? A ship ! " Keggs fell back on his cot , threw his legs and arms in the air , and neighed , wept , and giggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ships of the Navy , 1942 , from a shelf . " DMS  --  DMS  --  I swear to God there ai n't no such ship  --  no , wait . Here it is  --  DMS  --  page 63 . " The others crowded around him as he flipped the stiff pages to a picture of a queer narrow three-stack vessel . He read aloud : " DMSDestroyerMinesweeper . World War I destroyer converted for highspeedsweeping . ' " " Oh , God ! " breathed Keggs . " Mines . Mines . " He dropped into the chair and writhed . " Hell , boy , that 's a sight better than Mine Disposal . Sweeping is nothing . " Willie could n't muster up any such false cheer . The three had often talked about minesweeping and agreed it was the worst seagoing horror48 496DR . KEITH 'S LETTER When Ensign Keith followed the bellboy into his room in the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco , he was struck at once by the view of the city in the sunset . The hills were twinkling under a sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rose and violet in the east . The evening star shone clear , hanging low over the Golden Gate Bridge . Eastward the lamps were burning along the gray arches of the Oakland Bridge , a string of amber gems . The bellboy turned on lights , opened closets , and left Willie alone with the sunset and his bags . The new ensign stood by the window for a moment , stroking his gold stripe , and wondering at so much beauty and splendor so far from New York . " Might as well unpack , " he said to the evening star , and opened his pigskin valise . Most of his belongings were in a wooden crate in the hotel 's check room . In the valise he carried only a few changes of clothes . On top of a layer of white shirts lay two mementos of his last hours in New York  --  a phonograph record and a letter . Willie rolled the record between his fingers and wished he had brought his portable phonograph . How perfect a setting the evening was for May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had recorded it for him in a Broadway shop one night when they were both giddy with champagne . Willie smiled as he thought of the delicious April evenings with May during his ten days ' leave . He reached for the telephone , then pulled back his hand , realizing that it was near midnight in the Bronx , when all candy stores were shut and dark . Besides , he reminded himself , he was giving May up , because he could n't marry her , and she was too good a girl to be kept dangling . His plan had been to enjoy an ecstatic farewell , then depart and never write or answer letters , allowing the relationship to die peacefully of malnutrition . May had n't been informed 52 of the plan . He had fulfilled the first part , now he must remember the second . He laid aside the record and picked up his father 's mysterious letter . No use holding it to the light , it was bulky and utterly opaque . He shook it , and sniffed it , and wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When do you think you 'll get to the Caine ? " the father had asked , the afternoon before Willie 's departure . " I do n't know , Dad  --  in three or four weeks . " " No more ? " " Maybe six weeks , tops . They move us out pretty fast , I hear . " Thereupon his father had limped to the desk and drawn the sealedenvelope out of a leather portfolio . " When you report aboard the Caine  --  the day you get there , not before or after , open this and read it . " " What 's in it ? " " Why , if I wanted you to know now I would n't have gotten myself a writer 's cramp scrawling it , would I ? " " It is n't money ? I wo n't need money . " " No , not money . " " Sealed orders , eh ? " " Something like that . You 'll do as I say ? " " Of course , Dad . " " Fine --  Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to your mother . " Three thousand miles from his father and the scene of the promise , Willie was tempted to peek at the contents ; merely to glance at the first page , no more . He tugged at the flap . It was dry , and came loose easily without tearing . The letter was open for Willie 's inspection . But the thin strand of honor held , after all , across the continent . Willie licked the crumbled paste on the open flap , sealed the letter tight , and tucked it out of sight at the bottom of the valise . Knowing his own character , he thought it well to minimize the strain on it . Well , he thought , he would write a letter to May after all  --  just one . She would expect it . Once he went to sea , silence would be understandable ; now it would be cruel , and Willie did n't want to treat May cruelly . He seated himself at the desk and composed a long warm letter . May would have needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was writing the last tender paragraph when the phone rang . " Willie ? Doggone you , boy , how are you ? " It was Keefer . " I got your wire , boy . I been phoning all day . Where you been , boy ? " " Plane got hung up in Chicago , Rollo  --  " " Well , come on out , boy , time 's a-wasting . We just getting a party organized  --  " 53r " Where are you  --  Fairmont ? " " Junior Officers ' Club  --  Powell Street . Hurry up . There 's a tall blonde on the loose here that is a dish --  " " Where 's Keggs ? " " He 's gone already , Willie , gone to sea . Three weeks ' delay getting transportation for everybody in Frisco except old horseface  --  " " How come ? " " Why , the poor boy was down in transportation office , see , he just come off the train , he was getting his orders endorsed . Would n't you know , the phone rings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Pearl , and he 's got room for three more officers . Keggs gets endorsed right over to him . He never even changed his socks in Frisco . Left Tuesday . Missed everything . This is the town , Willie . Liquor and gals till you ca n't stand up . Get on your bicycle  --  " " Be right over , Rollo . " He felt slightly hypocritical , finishing up the letter to May . But he asserted to himself that he was entitled to any fun he could grasp before he went out to sea . Willie considered himself a mistreated hero ; he still smarted under the insult of his orders to the Caine . After triumphing over the handicapof forty-eight demerits and rising to the top five per cent of the school , he had been sent to sweep mines on an obsolete World War I ship ! It was mortifying  --  twice so , because Keggs , nearest him on the alphabetical list but almost two hundred numbers below him in standing , had drawn identical duty . Obviously the Navy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they deserved , one after another , like hogs being slaughtered . So Willie believed . He was drawn into a round of drinking and partying that lasted twenty days . He rolled with Keefer from clubs to bars to girls ' apartments . He quickly became popular because of his piano entertaining . Officers and girls alike were rapturous over If You Knew What the Gnu Knew : he had to sing it several times every night . He resurrected a knack developed in college days of making up rhymes on people 's names as he sang : " Hirohito trembles when he hears of Keefer , To calm his nerves he has to light a reefer  --  " Willie could go nimbly from name to name in the room , improvising such couplets to a jazzy refrain . This astounded his audiences , especially the girls , who thought his talents bordered on witchcraft . He and Keefer roared up and down the hair-raising hills in an old rented Ford , and dined mightily on Chinese food , abalones and crabs , and did very54little sleeping . They were invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great war . Keefer became friendly with an officer in the transportation department . The result was that the roommates were assigned to a hospital ship for their voyage westward . " Nurses and fresh strawberries  --  that 's the ticket , Willie my boy , " Keefer said , proudly announcing this news . They rolled aboard the Mercy at dawn after a roistering farewell party , and they continued the same pace of pleasure all the while the ship was steaming toward Hawaii . Nurses clustered around Willie at the piano in the lounge every evening . There were sharp restrictions aboard the Mercy on place and time of meetings between the sexes , but Keefer quickly learned his way about the ship and arranged for the pursuit of happiness at all hours . They saw very little of the Pacific Ocean . They debarked in Honolulu arm in arm with two freethinking nurses , Lieutenants Jones and Carter ; exchanged brief kisses under the huge Dole 's pineapple electric sign , and agreed to meet for dinner . The two ensigns piled their luggage into the taxicab of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Base , Pearl , please . " " Yes , gentlemans . " Keefer got off at the bachelor officers ' quarters , a structure of unpaintedwood . Willie went to the personnel officer in the cement office building of the Hawaiian Sea Frontier , and was told that the Caine was at the Navy Yard in repair berth C-4 . He threw his baggage into anothercab and raced out to the repair basin . Berth C-4 contained only a slosh of empty filthy water . He wandered around the yard amid deafeningsounds of ship repair , asking questions of workmen , sailors , and officers . None of them had heard of the ship . Battleships , carriers , cruisers , destroyers , in drydock or alongside docks , were everywhere : gray monsters in dozens , swarming with riveters and sailors . But no Caine . So Willie returned to the personnel officer . " Do n't tell me , " said the fat lieutenant , " they fouled up this berthing chart again --  " He searched through a heap of despatches in a box on his desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . Shoved off this morning . " " Where to ? " " Sorry . Classified . " " Well , what do I do now ? " " I do n't know . You should have caught her . " " My ship just got in an hour ago . " " That 's not my fault . " " Look , " said Willie , " all I want to know is , how do I get transportationfrom this point to catch up with the Caine ? " " Oh . You want Transportation . Well , I 'm Personnel . You 'll have to55see Transportation . " The lieutenant got up , put a nickel in a Coca-Cola machine , drew out a frosty bottle , and drank noisily . Willie waited till he had seated himself again . " Who and where is Transportation ? " " Jesus , I do n't know . " Willie walked out of the office . Blinking in the glare of the sun , he noticed a sign on the next door : Transportation . " He does n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dried-up woman of thirty-seven or so sat at the desk . " Sorry , " she said , as Willie entered , " no more scooters . " " All I want , " said Willie , " is transportation to the U.S.S. Caine . " " Caine ? Where is it at ? " " I do n't know . " " Then how on earth do you expect to get to it ? " She pulled a CocaColabottle out of a desk drawer , flipped off the cap against the edge of her desk , and drank . " Nobody will tell me where the ship is bound for . It left this morning . " " Oh . It 's not in the yard ? " " No , no . It 's at sea . " " Well , then , how do you expect to get to it on a scooter ? " " I do n't want a scooter , " exclaimed Willie . " Did you hear me ask for a scooter ? " " You came in here , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scooter pool . " " It says Transportation ' outside . " " Well , a scooter is transportation --  " " Okay , okay , " said Willie , " I 'm new here , and very stupid . Please tell me how to get a start toward my ship . " The woman pondered , clicking the green bottle against her teeth . " Well , I guess you want Fleet Transportation . This is Yard Trans-portation . " " Thank you . Where is Fleet Transportation ? " " Jesus , I do n't know . Why do n't you ask Personnel next door ? " Willie gave up for the day . If the Navy was in no hurry to send him after the Caine , he was in no hurry to go . He went back to the bachelorofficers ' quarters , thoroughly tired of piling a crate and two bags in and out of taxis . " Just in time , boy . " Keefer was fresh and cool in newly pressed khaki shirt and trousers . Willie still wore his hot , heavy blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurses tonight . Jonesy and Carter got permission to bring us along . " " Which admiral ? " " Who knows ? They thick as fleas on a dog 's back around here . You find your ship ? " " Shoved off today . Nobody will say where . " " Fine , fine . Nice delay , probably . Shower up . " The admiral 's party , at his handsome home inside the base , started as a quiet affair . Most of the guests were within earshot of an admiral for the first time and they minded their manners . The admiral , a big bald man with startling black hollows under his eyes , received everyone with genial majesty in his straw-matted , flower-filled living room . After drinks had flowed for a while the atmosphere warmed . Willie , urged on by Keefer , timidly sat at the piano and played . The admiral brightenedat the first notes , and moved to a seat near the piano . He waved his glass to the rhythm of the music . " The boy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow . " By George , these reserves bring some life into things . " " They certainly do , sir . " Keefer heard this exchange . " Hey , Willie , give us the Gnu Knew . " Willie shook his head , but the admiral said , " What ? What 's that ? Let 's have it , whatever it is . " The song caused a sensation . The admiral put down his glass and applauded , whereupon everyone else did the same . He was in chuckling high spirits . " What 's your name , Ensign ? By George , you 're a find . " " Keith , sir . " " Keith . Good name . Not a Keith from Indiana ? " " No , sir . Long Island . " " Good name anyway . Now , let 's have some more music . Let 's see . Do you know Who Hit Annie in the Fanny with a Flounder ? " " No , sir . " " Hell , I thought everyone knew that . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly , " Willie can pick it up in a second . " " By God I will , " said the admiral , glancing around at the captain beside him , " if Matson here will pitch in . " " Certainly , Admiral . " Willie easily picked up the refrain of Who Hit Annie in the Fanny with a Flounder , and the house rocked with the chorus sung twice by all hands , male and female . The nurses giggled , cooed , and twittered . " This is the best damn party , " cried the admiral , " we 've ever had . Somebodygive me a cigarette . Where are you stationed , boy ? I want you to come again , often . " " I 'm trying to catch up with the U.S.S. Caine , sir . " " Caine ? Caine ? Christ , is she still in commission ? " Captain Matson leaned over and said , " Converted DMS , sir . " " Oh , one of those . Where is she ? " " Just left today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " " Hm . " The admiral regarded Willie keenly . " Matson , can you take care of this lad ? " " I think so , Admiral . " " Well , more music , Keith ! " When the party broke up at midnight , the captain slipped Willie his card . " Come and see me at 0900 , Keith . " " Aye aye , sir . " Next morning Willie presented himself at the captain 's office in the CincPac Building . The captain rose and shook hands pleasantly . " Sure enjoyed your music , Keith . Never saw the admiral have a better time . By God , he needs it  --  does him good . " " Thank you , sir . " " Well , " said the captain , " if you want I can put you on a plane for Australia . Maybe you 'll catch the Caine down there , maybe you wo n't . She 's running convoy . Those escorts get shoved here and there by every port director who gets his hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or , " said the captain , " we can put you on temporary duty here in the officer pool till she gets back to Pearl . Might be a few weeks , might be a few months . Depends on whether you 're in a hurry for combat duty or --  They can use you out there , sure enough . The admiral would n't interfere with your going out , in any way . " Captain Matson grinned . Willie glanced through the broad picture window which faced the sea and the hills . A rainbow was drifting down a palm-covered misty mountainside far away . Outside on the lawn crimson hibiscus blossoms stirred in the warm breeze , and a sprinkler twirled a sparkling spiral of water over the close-clipped grass . " Officer pool sounds swell to me , sir . " " Fine . The admiral will be pleased . Bring your orders around to my yeoman any time today . " Willie was officially transferred to the officer pool , and took up quarterswith Keefer in the BOQ . The Southerner , who had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpacked his bags . " Boy , you catching on to the military life . " " I do n't know . Maybe they needed me on the Caine --  " " Shinola on that . You gon na get all the war you want , boy . You keep little old Keefer and the admiral happy a few weeks , that 's all . " He rose and swiftly knotted a black tie . " Got the duty . See you tonight . " Unpacking , Willie came upon his father 's letter . He took it up uncertainly . Months might pass now , before he reached his ship . Dr. Keith had told him to open it upon reporting for duty . He was on duty  --  temporary duty , to be sure , but it might last a long time . He lit a cigarette , tore open the letter , and sat down to read it . At the first words he started up . He read on , sitting on the edge of the chair , the letter trembling in his hands , the cigarette burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DEAR WILLIE : By the time you read this letter , I think I will be dead . I 'm sorry to startle you but I suppose there 's no pleasant way to break such news . The trouble I 've been having with my toe is due to a rather vicious disorder , malignant melanoma . The prognosis is one hundredper cent bad . I 've known about my condition for a long time , and figured that I would probably die this summer . But the toe began to go a bit sooner . I suppose I should be in a hospital at this moment ( two nights before you leave ) but I hate to spoil your departure , and since there 's no hope anyway , I 've postponed it . I 'm going to try to stall until I know you 've left San Francisco . Your mother does n't know anything yet . My guess is that I wo n't last more than three or four weeks , now . I 'm a little young to go , according to the insurance tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I daresay that 's because I 've accomplishedso little . I look back on my life , Willie , and there 's not much there . Your mother has been a fine wife , and I have no regrets on that score . But I seem to have led such a thoroughly second-rate life  --  not only compared to my father , but in view of my own capabilities . I had quite a feeling for research . When I fell in love with your mother I thought I could n't marry her withoutundertaking , general practice in a high-income community . It was my plan to make a pile in ten or fifteen years of such work , and then return to research . I really think I might have done something in cancer . I had a theory  --  a notion , you might say  --  nothing I could have put on paper . It needed three years of systematic investigation . Nobody has touched it to this day . I 've kept up with the literature . My name might have meant as much as my father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procedure . The worst of it is , I now feel your mother would have stood by me and lived modestly if I 'd really insisted . But I 've had a pleasant time , I can truly say that . I 've loved reading and golf , and I 've had all of that I wanted . The days have gone by all too fast . I wish I might have met this girl of yours . It seems to me that58 59she , or the Navy , or both , are having quite a good effect on you . And believe me , Willie , that is by far the brightest thought I take with me into the hospital . I 've let slide my relationship with you as I have so many other things , through plain sloth ; particularly since your mother seemed anxious to take charge of you . It 's too bad we had no more children . Just bad luck . Your mother had three miscarriages , which you may not know . I 'll tell you a curious thing . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than your mother has . She regards you as a hopeless baby who will have to be coddled through life . But I am coming to believe that though you are pretty spoiled and soft at the surface , you are tough enough at the core . After all , I see , you have always done pretty much as you pleased with your mother , while giving her the sense of ruling you . I 'm sure this was no plan on your part , but you 've done it anyway . You 've never had a serious problem in your life , up to this Navy experience . I watched you in the forty-eight demerits business very closely . It had its comical side , but really it was a challenge . You rose to it in an encouraging way . Perhaps because I know I 'll never see you again I find myself sentimentalizing over you , Willie . It seems to me that you 're very much like our whole country  --  young , naive , spoiled and softened by abundance and good luck , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This country of ours consists of pioneers , after all , these new Poles and Italians and Jews as well as the older stock , people who had the gumption to get up and go and make themselves better lives in a new world . You 're going to run into a lot of strange young men in the Navy , most of them pretty low by your standards , I daresay , but I 'll bet  --  though I wo n't live to see it  --  that they are going to make the greatest Navy the world has ever seen . And I think you 're going to make a good naval officer  --  after a while . After a great while , perhaps . This is not criticism , Willie , God knows I am pretty soft myself . Perhaps I 'm wrong . You may never make a naval officer at all . Perhaps we 're going to lose the war . I just do n't believe it . I think we 're going to win , and I think you 're going to come back with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed at having been sent to a ship like the Caine . Now , having seen it , you 're probably disgusted . Well , rememberthis , you 've had things your own way too long , and all your immaturity is due to that . You need some stone walls to batter yourself against . I strongly suspect you 'll find plenty of them there on the Caine . I do n't envy you the experience itself , but I do envyyou the strengthening you 're going to derive from it . Had I had one such experience in my younger years , I might not be dying a failure . Those are strong words , but I wo n't cross them out . They do n't hurt too much and , furthermore , my hand is n't the one to cross them out any more . I 'm finished now , but the last word on my life rests with you . If you turn out well , I can still claim some kind of success in the afterworld , if there is one . About your singing versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war is over . Do n't waste brain power over the far future . Concentrate on doing well now . Whatever assignment they give you on the Caine , remember that it 's worthy of your best efforts . It 's your way of fighting the war . It 's surprising , how little I have to say to you in these last words . I ought to fill up a dozen more sheets , and yet I feel you are pretty good at getting your way  --  and in other matters any words I might write would make little sense , without your own experience to fill the words with meaning . Remember this , if you can  --  there is nothing , nothing more precious than time . You probably feel you have a measureless supply of it , but you have n't . Wasted hours destroy your life just as surely at the beginning as at the end  --  only at the end it becomes more obvious . Use your time while you have it , Willie , in making something of yourself . Religion . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having had much ourselves . But I think , after all , I will mail you a Bible before I go into the hospital . There is a lot of dry stuff in the Bible about Jewish wars and rituals that may put you off  --  but do n't make the mistake of skipping the Old Testament . It 's the core of all religion , I think , and there is a lot of everyday wisdom in it . You have to be able to recognize it . That takes time . Meantime get familiar with the words . You 'll never regret it . I came to the Bible as I did to everything in life , too late . About money matters . I 'm leaving all my property to your mother . Uncle Lloyd is the executor . There is a ten-thousanddollarpolicy of which you 're the beneficiary . If you want to get married , or go back to school , that should be enough to enable you to carry out your plans . Money is a very pleasant thing , Willie , and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work you really want to do . If you sell out your time for a comfortablelife , and give up your natural work , I think you lose the exchange . There remains an inner uneasiness that spoils the comforts . Well , Willie , it 's 3 A.M. by my old leather-covered desk clock . A waning moon is shining through the library window , and my fingers are stiff from writing . My toe is giving me the devil , too . Sleeping pills and bed for me . Thank God for barbiturate . Take care of your mother if she lives to be very old , and be kind to her if you come back from the war with enough strength to break away from her . She has many faults , but she 's good , and she has loved you and me very truly . Willie began to sob . He read the last paragraphs through a blur of tears . Think of me and of what I might have been , Willie , at the times in your life when you come to crossroads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who took the wrong turns , take the right ones , and carry my blessing and my justification with you . I stretch out my hand to you . We have n't kissed in many , many years . I liked to kiss you when you were a baby . You were a very sweet and good-natured child , with wonderful large eyes . God ! Long ago . Good-by , my son . Be a man . DADThe ensign rose , wiping his eyes , and hurried downstairs to the telephone booth . He dropped a coin into the box . " I want to call the United States -- - " " Sorry . Private calls only at Central Building with censor 's permission . One week delay on them , " said the operator with a Hawaiian accent . Willie ran out into the naval base and went from building to buildinguntil he found the telegraph office . How is Dad ? he cabled , and paid the urgent rate , giving the office as his return address . Next morning at eight when the office opened Willie was waiting outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer was brought to him . Dad died three days ago . Sent you his love in last words . Please write . Mother . Willie went straight to the office of Captain Matson , who greeted him cordially . " Have they put you to work yet , Keith ? " " Sir , on reconsidering , I 'd like to fly out to look for the Caine , if I may . " The captain 's face fell . " Oh ? What 's the matter ? They give you some rugged coding detail ? " " No , sir . " I 've already told the admiral you 're set here . He was extremely pleased . " 6z " Sir , if I may say so , it just does n't seem like fighting the war  --  playing piano for the admiral . " A hard distant look came over the captain 's features . " There 's plenty of work to do in this establishment . You 'll find that a shore billet is as honorable as any other . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the officer pool at your own request . " " Yes , sir , I know , but --  " " Your orders have been put through and sent to the Bureau . I see no reason to countermand them . Your request is denied . " The captain picked up a paper before him and put on his glasses . " Thank you , sir , " said Willie , and left . And so Willie stayed at Pearl Harbor , decoding messages which told of great actions around Rendova and Munda , of the victorious night battle at Vella Lavella , and of huge preparations for further invasions . Often he came upon the name of the Caine in despatches showing her in the thick of the operations . And across the world the Allies smashed into Sicily and Italy , and Mussolini fell . Meantime Willie played piano for the admiral. 1 THE CAINEBut the soreness over his father 's death lessened gradually , and Willie began to enjoy Pearl Harbor . His coding duties involved eight hours a day of drudgery in a cement vault underground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and the liquor for a couple of weeks , but then the admiral had another party , and Willie got drunk , and soon he was back at the old round . Honolulu was full of easy pleasures . The climate was soft , the sun brilliant , the moon beautiful , the air perfumed by ever-blooming flowers . Except for the curfew and the black-out and some barbed wire along the beaches the war caused little inconvenience . Willie went on many picnics with the nurses . He acquired a rosy tan and became plumper . He continued writing tremendously affectionate letters to May . The plan for dropping her was discarded . Willie had decided that May was not too old to waste a year or two . He might marry her , he might not . But their relationship was too valuable an " experience " to be cut short . May 's letters were all that could be desired : long , loving , cheery , and usually containing good news . She was enjoying college , though she63felt like a grandmother , she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language in her letters improved each month . The roommates lay on their cots , reading newly arrived mail one sultry July afternoon . Flies buzzed at the screens , though there was no attraction inside the room but the smell of hot dry wood . Keefer lolled on his side , naked except for white shorts , his hairy stomach bulging over the waistband . " Christ on a bicycle ! " he exclaimed , rising on one elbow . " What 's the name of your ship again  --  Caine , ai n't it ? " " Yes , " said Willie , absorbed in a letter from May . " Well listen , boy , I think my brother Tom is on that ship ! " Willie glanced up in surprise . " I think it 's the Caine , " said Keefer . " Never can make out my pap 's doggone handwriting . Here , how do you read this ? " Willie peered at the word indicated by Keefer 's thumb . " Caine all right . " " Sure enough . They sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fine . It 's a lucky break . It 'll be like having a relative on board . Does he like the ship ? " " Hell , no . He wrote Pap it 's the foulest bucket in the Navy  --  But that do n't mean nothing , " he added quickly , seeing Willie wince . " Hell , do n't take anything that Tom says too serious . Tom 's queer as a threedollarbill . The Caine 's probably a great ship if he do n't like it . " " What kind of guy is he , Rollo ? " ' Well , you try to figure how different from me a guy can get  --  and that 's Tom . See , he 's only my half brother . I 've seen very little of him . His mother was my dad 's first wife  --  Catholic . They got married Protestant , and it did n't last long , and she hauled off home to Boston where she come from , with Tom . " Keefer put aside the letter , lit a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tom 's a high-brow , pretty much , writes short stories , plays  --  had some stuff in magazines . Gets real dough for them . I got to know him a little bit at William and Mary . He was a senior when I was a freshman . But he ran around with that literary crowd , you know , reading poetry by candlelight , with a few dames around for when the candles went out  --  that kind of Shinola . I guess he figures me for a moron , he 's never bothered with me a damn . He 's not a bad guy . Pretty witty and all that . You and him will probably get along good , with you reading all that Dickens and all . " It was the first of September when Willie and Keefer staggered into the BOQ at four in the morning , full of hog meat and whisky which 64they had consumed at a hilarious luau arranged by the nurses . They fell on their beds still giggling and singing ribald parodies of Hawaiian songs . Soon they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was being shaken , and a strange voice was whispering loudly , " Keith ? Keith ? Are you Keith ? " He opened his eyes . Day was just dawning . In the dim light he saw a short , swarthy ensign in shapeless frayed khakis standing over him . " Yes , I 'm Keith . " " Better come along . I 'm Paynter , from the Caine . " " The Caine ? " Willie sat up . " She 's here ? " " Yep . We 're shoving off at o800 to do some target towing . Get your gear together . " Willie sleepily reached out for his trousers . " Look , I 'll be glad to report aboard , Paynter , but I 'm still attached to the officer pool here . " " No , you 're not . That 's all fixed . We 've got a visual despatch detachingyou . We 've been waiting for you a long time , Keith . " He said it pleasantly , but Willie felt obliged to defend himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours back in May when you shoved off . They stuck me into the officer pool --  " " Hell , I would n't blame you if you never showed up , " said Paynter . " I hate to be the guy who does this to you . Can I help you with your gear ? " All this talking was in low tones . Keefer snored obliviously . As Willie emptied drawers of the bureau into his wooden foot locker , he said , " Do you have an officer aboard named Keefer ? Tom Keefer ? " " My department head , " said Paynter . " That 's his brother . " Willie pointed to the sleeper . Paynter looked at Keefer dully . Willie , more wide awake , noticed that the Caine officer was slumping with fatigue . " How screwy is he ? " said Paynter . " Why ? Is your department head screwy ? " " I did n't say that . Better bear a hand , Keith . The boat 's waiting on us . " " Are we leaving Pearl for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are I 'll wake up Roland and say good-by . " " No . We 're not leaving for good . At least not according to orders . " " Fine . " Willie finished packing and dressed in silence . He shouldered his foot locker and stumbled out through the door . Paynter followed with his two bags , saying , " But do n't be surprised if we take off west and never see civilization for a year . It 's happened before . " Outside the BOQ in the chill misty morning stood a small gray Navy65dump truck . " Not very classy , " said Paynter , " but that 's all I could get at five in the morning . Pile in . " They rattled down the road toward the fleet landing . Willie 's luggage jumped and lunged around in the back as though trying to escape . " Where 's the ship ? " said Willie , wondering at the dour silence of Ensign Paynter . " Moored to a buoy in the stream . " " Are you regular Navy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard ? " " Three . " " Are you V-7 ? " " Yes . " " Deck ? " " No , engineering . " " What are your duties on the Caine ? " " Communications . " Willie was startled . " Is n't that a queer assignment for an engineer ? " " Not on the Caine . " " I take it you do n't like the Caine . " " I did n't say that . " " What 's the ship like ? " " You 'll see for yourself . " " Seen a lot of action ? " " Yes and no . " " You been aboard her long ? " " Depends . " " On what ? " " On what you call long . " " I call a year long . " " I call a week long sometimes . " The truck pulled up at the head of steps leading down to the fleet landing . Paynter honked . Three sailors lying in a half-canopied greasy gray boat alongside the dock rose wearily and mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shirttails hung outside the trousers . They loaded Willie 's gear into the boat while Paynter turned the truck in to a car pool a few yards down the road . The two officers stepped into the boat and sat on cracked black leather seats inside the canopy . " All right , Meatball , shove off , " said Paynter to the coxswain , a fat sailor dressed in amazingly dirty rags , with a pure-white new hat tilted forward almost to his nose . A bell clanged in Willie 's ear and he jumped . His head was no more than an inch from the bell . He shifted to another cushion . The boat 66engineer started up he motor , after several failures which he commented on with filthy epithets delivered in an indifferent monotone . He was perhaps nineteen , small and gaunt , with a face blackened half by stubble and half by grease , and covered with pimples . Long , coarse black hair fell over his tiny squinting eyes . He wore no hat . He was addressed by the other sailors as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the landing he took off his shirt , exposing a monkey-like growth of hair . Willie looked around at the boat . The gray paint was blistering off the wood , and ragged patches showed where new paint had been daubed over old without scraping . Two of the three portholes of the canopy had cardboard in them instead of glass . " Mr. Paynter , " shouted the engineer over the racket of the motor ,  --  can we stop off and pick up a movie ?  --  " No . " " Christ , we ai n't seen no movie forever , " whined Horrible . " No stopping . " Horrible thereupon blasphemed and cursed for a couple of minutes . Willie , appalled at his freedom of language in the officer 's presence , expected Paynter to bring him up short . But the stream of gutter talk appeared to trouble Paynter no more than the lapping of the water . He sat immobile , his fingers folded in his lap , his eyes closed , chewing a rubber band that protruded from his lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what duties do you suppose I 'll get aboard ship ? " Paynter opened his eyes . " Mine , " he said , with a brief happy smile , and closed them again . The gig rounded a point of Ford Island and headed into the western channel . " Hey , Mister Paynter , " called Meatball , standing tiptoe on the stern thwart , leaning on the tiller , " the ship 's gone . " " You 're crazy , Meatball , " said Paynter . " Look again . She 's in R-6 , forward of the Belleau Wood . " " I 'm telling you , sir , the buoys are empty . For Christ 's sake , take a look . " He clanged the bell with a pull cord . The boat slowed , and wallowed in the waves . Paynter climbed out on the gunwale . " I 'll be damned . She is gone . Now what the hell ? " " Maybe she sank , " said the sailor crouched on the bow , a small babyfacedyoungster with a highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Meatball . " Could be , " said Horrible . " Chief Budge had ' em scraping bilges in number-two engine room . I told him there was n't nothin ' keepin ' the water out but that rust . " 67 " What do we do now , Mister Paynter ? " said Meatball . " Well , let 's see . They would n't put out to sea without the gig , " said Paynter slowly . " Probably they 've just shifted berths . Look around . " Horrible killed the motor . The boat drifted gently in dead quiet past a bobbing red channel buoy . From the water rose an effluvium of fuel oil and rotten vegetables . " There she is , " said Meatball , and clanged the bell . " Where ? " said Paynter . " Repair basin . Right there starboard of the St. Louis  --  " The coxswain thrust the tiller over . The boat swung about . " Yeah . " Paynter nodded . " Guess we get our alongside period after all . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction Meatball had been looking , could see nothing that resembled the Caine . The repair basin was crammed with ships of every shape except the DMS silhouette which Willie had memorized from pictures . " Pardon me , " he shouted to Meatball , " can you point the ship out to me ? " " Sure . There . " The coxswain jerked his head meaninglessly . " Do you see her ? " Willie said to Horrible . " Sure . She 's in that nest of cans in C-4 . " Willie wondered whether his vision had gone bad . Paynter said , " You ca n't see nothing but the trucklight from here . You 'll see her soon enough . " It humiliated Willie not to be able to recognize his ship by the trucklight . He punished himself by standing up and taking spray in his face for the rest of the ride . The gig came alongside a limp chain ladder hanging over the side of a new destroyer , the outer ship of four in the repair berth . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the one inboard of this . The men will bring your gear . " Willie went up the jingling ladder , saluted the smart OOD of the destroyer , and crossed the deck . A tarry plank laid between the ships over four feet of open water led to the Caine . Willie got no distinct impression of his ship at first glance . He was too concerned about the plank . He hung back . Paynter mounted the board , saying , " This way . " As he crossed , the Caine rolled and the plank wobbled violently . Paynter jumped off it to the Caine deck . It occurred to Willie that if Paynter had fallen from the plank he would have been crushed between the two ships . With this picture bright in his mind Willie set foot on the plank and pranced across like a circus acrobat . Halfway , hanging over the open water , he felt the plank heave upward . He leaped for life , and landed on the Caine in the arms of the OOD , staggering him. 68 " Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OOD . " You do n't know what you 're jumping into . " " Rabbitt , this is the long-lost Ensign Keith , " said Paynter . " So I gathered . " Lieutenant ( jg ) Rabbitt shook Willie 's hand . He was of middle size , with a narrow face and an air of rustic good humor . " Welcome aboard , Keith . Say , Paynter , this Ensign Harding showed up too , half an hour ago . " " All kinds of new blood , " said Paynter . The focus of Willie 's mind widened beyond the plank now and took in the quarterdeck of the Caine . It was a place of noise , dirt , bad smells , and thuglike strangers . Half a dozen sailors were clanking at the rusty deck with metal scrapers . Other sailors were walking past , cursing under crates of cabbages on their backs . One man in a welding mask was burning a bulkhead with a crackling sour-smelling blue flame . All around were patches of new gray paint , patches of old gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rust . A tangle of snaky hoses , red , black , green , yellow , brown lay all over the deck . The deck was covered with orange peel , fragments of magazines and old rags . Most of the sailors were half naked and wore fantastic beards and haircuts . Oaths , blasphemies , and one recurring four-letter word filled the air like fog . " God knows where you go , " said Rabbitt . " There are no more bunks in the wardroom . " " The exec will think of something , " said Paynter . " Okay , Keith , you 're logged aboard , " said Rabbitt . " Paynt , will you take him down to the exec ? " " Sure . Follow me , Keith . " Paynter led Willie down a ladder and through a dark stifling passageway . " This is the half deck . " He opened a door . " This is the ward-room . " They passed through an untidy rectangular room as wide as the ship , mostly filled by a long table set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereal , . and pitchers of milk . Magazines and books were scatteredon the lounging chairs and black leather couch . Willie noted with horror several secret publications among comic-strip books , leg-art magazines , and frayed Esquires . Leading forward from the middle of the wardroom was a passageway of staterooms . Paynter entered the first room on the right . " Here 's Keith , sir , " he said , pushing aside the curtain in the doorway . " Keith , this is the executive officer , Lieutenant Gorton . " An enormously fat , husky young man , nude except for tiny drawers , sat up on a raised bunk , scratching his ribs and yawning . The green bulkheads of the room were decorated with colored cutout pictures69of girls in flimsy underwear . " Greetings , Keith . Where the hell you been ? " said Lieutenant Gorton in a high voice , and swung mammoth thighs out of the bed . He shook Willie 's hand . Paynter said , " Where do we put him ? " " Jesus , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs off the beach ? Those eggs we got in New Zealand will dissolve your fillings by now . " " Oh , here 's the captain , maybe he has an idea , " said Paynter , looking off into the passageway . " Sir , Ensign Keith has reported aboard . " " Collared him , did you ? Nice work , " said a voice full of irony and authority , and the captain of the Caine came to the doorway . Willie was even more startled by him . The captain was absolutely naked . In one hand he carried a cake of Lifebuoy soap , in the other a lighted cigarette . He had a creased old-young face , blond hair , and a flabby white body . " Welcome aboard , Keith ! " " Thank you , sir . " Willie felt an urge to salute , to bow , in some way to express reverence for supreme authority . But he remembered a regulationabout not saluting a superior when he was uncovered . And he had never seen a more uncovered superior than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's discomfiture , and scratched his behind with the soap cake . " I hope you know something about communications , Keith . " " Yes , sir . That 's what I 've been doing for CincPac while  --  while waiting for the ship , sir . " " Good . Paynter , you 're an assistant engineering officer again as of now . " " Thanks , sir . " Paynter 's gloomy face was suffused with fleeting happiness . He sighed like a horse having a saddle taken off . " Got any idea , Captain , where we stash the new communicator ? " " Did Maryk put a bunk in the clipping shack ? " " Yes , sir . That 's where we 've stuck this other new one , Harding . " " Well , tell Maryk to hang another bunk in there . " " Pretty damn crowded in that clip shack even for one , Captain , " said the exec . " War is a terrible thing . I 've got to shower , before I curdle . " Captain de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashtray on the desk made of a three-inch shell , and walked off . The fat lieutenant shrugged , and drew on a pair of tentlike trousers . " That 's it , " he said . " Take him to the clip shack , Paynt . " " Sir , " said Willie , " I 'm ready to get to work any time . " Gorton yawned , and regarded Willie with amused eyes . " Do n't burn out any bearings . Just mosey around the ship for a couple of days . Get used to it . It 's going to be your home for a long , long time . " " Suits me , sir , " said Willie . " I 'm due for some sea duty . " He had resigned himself to a stay of six months to a year . It was his year in the wilderness , the ordeal of which his father had written , and he was ready to face it . " Glad you feel that way , " said the exec . " Who knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months on this bucket , myself . " Willie divided by twelve and quailed . Lieutenant Gorton had been on the Caine for five years . " There 's something about the DMS outfit , " went on Gorton cheerfully , " that makes the Bureau reluctant to shift personnel . Maybe the file is lost back in Washington . We got two chiefs aboard with more than a hundred months . Captain de Vriess has seventy-one . So you 'll get your sea duty  --  Well  --  glad to have you aboard . Take it easy . " Willie stumbled after Paynter to the clipping shack , a metal box on the main deck about seven feet high , six long , and three wide . A doorwaywas the only opening . A shelf ran along one side , waist-high , piled with empty clipping belts for machine-gun bullets and cases of ammunition . Ensign Harding was sleeping on a bunk which had been recentlywelded into the wall close to the deck ; the weld was still bright and angry-looking . Sweat was pouring off Harding 's face , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shack was about 105 degrees . " Home sweet home , " said Willie . " This Harding has Caine blood in him , " Paynter said . " He 's starting off right --  Well , there 'll be some transfers any day . You guys 'll be down in the wardroom right soon . " He started to go . " Where can I find Mr. Keefer ? " said Willie . " In his sack , " said Paynter . " I mean later in the day . " " So do I , " said Paynter , and departed . Willie wandered around the Caine for a couple of hours , poking his nose down ladders and hatchways and into doorways . He was ignored by the sailors as though he were invisible , except when he faced one in a passageway . Then the sailor would flatten automatically against the bulkhead , as though to allow a big animal to pass . Willie 's sight-seeing tour confirmed his first impression . The Caine was a pile of junk in the last hours of decay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Overhead the metal scrapers pounded loudly . The long table was covered with green baize now , and the magazines and books had been shelved . The room was empty except for a very tall skinny colored boy in sweaty white undershirt and trousers , who was listlessly dabbing at the deck with a mop . " I'm70 7 1the new officer , Ensign Keith , " said Willie . " Might I have a cup of coffee ? " " Yassuh . " The steward 's mate put down the mop , and sauntered to a Silex on a metal bureau in the corner . " What 's your name ? " said Willie . " Whittaker , suh , steward 's mate second . Cream and sugar , suh ? " " Please . " Willie glanced around . A tarnished brass plaque on the bulkhead informed him that the ship had been named for one Arthur Wingate Caine , commander of a destroyer in World War I who had died of wounds received in a gun battle with a German submarine . Above the plaque on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume , Ship 's Organization , U.S.S. Caine , DMS 22 . Willie took it down . The steward 's mate set the coffee before him . " How long have you been on the Caine , Whittaker ? " " Fo ' months , suh . " " How do you like it ? " The Negro backed away , his eyes bulging as though Willie had whipped out a knife . " Bes ' ship in de whole Navy , suh . " He grabbed the mop and ran out the door . The coffee was lukewarm and muddy but Willie drank it . He needed stimulation badly . One hour of sleep had allowed him little recovery from the luau . He read the statistics of the Caine blearily . It had been built in 1918 in Rhode Island ( " Before I was born , " he muttered ) . It was 317 feet long and 31 feet wide and could make a flank speed of 30 knots . Upon conversion for minesweeping one of its four stacks and a boiler had been removed to make room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Overhead the clanking became louder ; another work party was startingto chip paint . The air in the wardroom was growing hot and foul as the sun rose higher . The mission of the high-speed minesweeper , Willie read , is primarily to sweep in enemy waters ahead of invasion or bombardment forces . He dropped the book on the table , laid his head on it , and groaned . " Hullo , " said a voice , " are you Keith or Harding ? " The speaker stumbled sleepily past him toward the Silex , dressed in nothing but an athletic supporter . It occurred to Willie that the conventions of modesty aboard the Caine were simpler than those among the Iroquois Indians . " Keith , " he answered . " Fine . You work for me . " " You 're Mr. Keefer ? " " Yes . " The communications officer leaned his back against the bureau and gulped coffee . There was little resemblance to his brother in the long72lean face . Tom Keefer was over six feet tall , small-boned and stringy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense , wild look . His mouth like Roland 's was wide , but the lips , far from being fleshy , were narrow and pale . Willie said , " Sir , I know your brother Roland . We were roommates in midshipmen 's school . He 's here in Pearl now at the BOQ . " " Really ? We 'll have to get him down here . " Keefer coolly put down the coffee cup . " Come into my room and tell me about yourself . " Keefer lived in an iron cubicle crisscrossed with pipes at the head of the passageway . There were two bunks installed against the curving hull , and a desk piled three feet high with books , pamphlets , wire baskets full of papers , and registered publications in a scrambled heap , on top of which was a stack of freshly laundered khakis , socks , and underwear . There was a prone naked figure in the upper bunk . While the communications officer shaved and dressed , Willie describedhis days at Furnald Hall with Roland . His eye rambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and along Keefer 's bunk were crammed volumes of poetry , fiction , and philosophy . The collection was impressive ; it was like a college list of the Hundred Best Books , somewhat heavy on the modern side with the works of Joyce , T. S. Eliot , Proust , Kafka , Dos Passos , and Freud , with several books on psychoanalysis and a few that bore Catholic publishing house imprints . " You 've really got the books , " said Willie . " This life is slow suicide , unless you read . " " Roland told me you 're a writer . " " I was trying to be one before the war , " said Keefer , wiping lather off his face with a wet ragged towel . " Get to do any writing now ? " " Some . Now , about your duties  --  we 'll make you custodian of registeredpubs , and of course there 'll be coding --  " The steward 's mate Whittaker inserted his face through the dusty green curtain . " Chadan , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper bunk ; it rose , thrashed feebly , jumped to the deck , and commenced dressing itself . " Chadan ? " said Willie . " Chow down , in steward patois  --  lunch , " said Keefer . " The name of this vegetable with a face is Carmody . Carmody , this is the elusive Mr. Keith . " " Hello , " said Willie . " Urn , " said the figure , groping for shoes in the bottom of a black closet . " Come along , " said Keefer , " and break bread with the officers of the Caine . There is no escape , Keith . And the bread itself is n't too terrible . " 738 CAPTAIN DE VRIESSWillie planned to sleep after lunch . He was longing for sleep with every cell of his body . But it was not to be . He and Harding were collared after coffee by the " vegetable with a face , " Ensign Carmody . " Captain de Vriess says for me to take you two on a tour of the ship . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down ladders , and across teetering catwalks , and through narrow scuttles . They went from broilingengine spaces to icy clammy bilges . They splashed in water and slipped on grease and scratched themselves on metal projections . Willie saw everything through a reddish haze of fatigue . He retained only a confused memory of innumerable dark holes cluttered with junk or machines or beds , each hole with a novel odor imposed on the pervadingsmells of mildew , oil , paint , and hot metal . Carmody 's thoroughnesswas explained when he mentioned that he was an Annapolis man , class of ' 43 , the only regular officer aboard beside the captain and exec . He had narrow shoulders , pinched cheeks , small foxy eyes , and a tiny mustache . His conversation was spectacularly skimpy . " This is numberonefireroom , " he would say . " Any questions ? " Harding seemed as tired as Willie . Neither of them offered to prolong the tour with a single question . They stumbled after Carmody , exchanging haggard looks . At last , when Willie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmody said , ' Well , I guess that does it . " He led them forward to the well deck . " Just one more thing now . You climb that mast . " It was a wooden pole topped by a radar , and it looked about five hundred feet high . " What the hell for ? " whined Willie . " A mast is a mast . I see it , that 's enough . " " You 're supposed to explore the ship , " said Carmody , " from the bilges to the crow's-nest . There 's the crow's-nest . " He pointed to a tiny square iron grille at the very top of the mast . " Ca n't we do that tomorrow ? I 'm a tired old man , " said Harding , with a wistful smile . His face was youthful and kindly ; his hair recededdeeply at the crown , leaving only a narrow blond peak in the middle . He was slight and had pallid blue eyes . Carmody said , " I 'm supposed to report compliance prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't report compliance . " in " I have three kids , " said Harding , shrugging and setting his foot on the lowest of the metal brackets that studded the mast to the top . " Hope I see ' em again . " Slowly , painfully , he began to go up . Willie followed , clutching each bracket convulsively . He kept his eyes on the seat of Harding 's trousers , ignoring the dizzying view around him . The wind flapped his sweat-soaked shirt . They reached the crow's-nest in a couple of minutes . As Harding scrambled up on the platform Willie heard the ugly thump of a skull striking metal . " Ouch ! Christ , Keith , watch out for this radar , " moaned Harding . Willie crawled onto the crow's-nest on his stomach . There was barely room on the rickety grille for the two men side by side . They sat with feet dangling into empty blue space . " Well done ! " came Carmody 's voice thinly from below . " Good-by now . I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Willie stared down at the farawaydeck , then quickly pulled his eyes away and took in the surroundingview . It was a fine one . The harbor sparkled beneath them , plain as a map in all its contours . But Willie took no pleasure in it . The height made him shudder . He felt he could never climb down again . " I regret to tell you , " said Harding in a small voice , his hand to his forehead , " that I am going to have to vomit . " " Oh , Christ , no , " said Willie . " Sorry . Height bothers me . I 'll try to keep from getting any on you . Jesus , though , all those guys down below . It 's awful . " " Ca n't you hold off ? " begged Willie . " Not a chance , " said Harding , his face a poisonous green . " Tell you what , though . I can do it in my hat . " He pulled off his officer 's cap , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only hat --  " " Here , " said Willie swiftly , " I have two others . " He offered Harding his new officer 's cap , upside down . " This is damned cordial of you , " gasped Harding . " You 're perfectly welcome , " said Willie . " Help yourself . " Harding threw up neatly into the extended hat . Willie felt a terrible urge to do likewise , but he fought it down . Harding 's color improved somewhat . " God , thanks , Keith . Now what do we do with it ? " " Good question , " said Willie , staring at the mournful object in his hands . " A hatful of  --  that  --  is an unhandy thing . " " Scale it out over the side . " Willie shook his head . " It might turn over . Wind might catch it . " " It 's a cinch , " said Harding , " you ca n't put it back on . " Willie unfastened the chin strap and looped the hat carefully to a75corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here forever , " said Willie , " as your salute to the Caine . " " I can never get down from here , " Harding said feebly . " You go ahead . I 'll die and rot here . Nobody will miss me except my family . " " Nonsense . Do you really have three kids ? " " Sure . My wife 's on the way to a fourth . " " What the hell are you doing in the Navy ? " " I 'm one of those silly jerks who thought he had to fight the war . " " Feeling better ? " " A little , thanks . " " Come on , " said Willie . " I 'll go first . You wo n't fall . If we stay up here much longer we 'll get so sick we 'll both fall off . " The descent was an endless slippery horror . Willie 's sweating hands slid on the shallow brackets , and at one ghastly point his foot slipped . But they both reached the deck . Harding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to lie down and kiss the deck , " he muttered . " There are sailors around , " whispered Willie . " It 's all in the day 's work . Come on , let 's hit the clip shack . " There were two bunks in the little tomb now . Harding dived into the bottom one , and Willie fell on the top bunk . For a while they lay silently , panting . " Well , " spoke Harding wearily at last , " I 've heard of friendships sealed in blood , but never in puke . All the same , Keith , I 'm obliged to you . You did a noble deed with your hat . " " I 'm just lucky , " said Willie , " that you did n't have to do the samefor me . No doubt you 'll have plenty of chance on this happy cruise . " " Any time , " said Harding , his , voice trailing off . " Any time , Keith . Thanks again . " He rolled over and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozed off when a hand reached into his bunk and shook him . " Chadan , suh , " said the voice of Whittaker , and his steps receded on the deck outside . " Harding , " groaned Willie , " do you want dinner ? " " Huh ? Dinner already ? No . Sleep is what I want --  " " We 'd better go . It 'll look bad if we do n't . " There were three officers at the wardroom table including the captain . The rest were off on shore leave . Willie and Harding took chairs at the lower end of the long white cloth and began eating in silence . The others ignored them and made incomprehensible jokes among themselves about things that had happened at Guadalcanal and New Zealand and Australia . Lieutenant Maryk was the first to glance their way . He was burly , round-faced , and pugnacious-looking , about twentyfive , with a prison haircut . " You guys look kind of red-eyed , " he said . Willie said , " We were caulking off for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like caulking off to start your career right , " the captain said to a pork chop , out of which he took a large bite . " Kind of hot in there , is n't it ? " said Adams , the gunnery officer . Lieutenant Adams wore fresh prim khakis . He had the long aristocraticface and negligent superior look which Willie had seen often at Princeton . It meant good family and money . " Kind of , " Harding said meekly . Maryk turned to the captain . " Sir , that doggone clip shack is over the engine room . These guys 'll fry in there  --  " " Ensigns are expendable , " the captain said . " What I mean , sir , I think I could hang a couple of bunks just as easy in Adams ' and Gorton 's room , or even in here over the couch --  " " The hell with that , " Adams said . " Is n't that a hull modification , Steve ? " the captain said , chewing pork . " You 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , sir , but I do n't think it is . " " Well , when you get around to it . The shipfitters are way behind as it is . " Captain de Vriess glanced at the ensigns . " Do you gentlemen think you can survive a week or two in the clip shack ? " Willie was tired , and the sarcasm irritated him . " Nobody 's complaining , " he said . De Vriess raised his eyebrows and grinned . " That 's the spirit , Mr. Keith . " He turned to Adams . " Have these gentlemen started on their officers ' qualification courses yet ? " " No , sir  --  Carmody had them all afternoon , sir --  ' Well , Mr. Senior Watch Officer , time 's a-wasting . Get them started after dinner . " " Aye aye , Captain . " The officers ' qualification courses were bulky mimeographed sheafs of coarse paper turning brown around the edges . They were dated 1935 . Adams brought them out of his room while the ensigns were still drinking coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are twelve assignments , " he said . " Complete the first by 0900 tomorrow and leave it on my desk . Thereafter complete one a day while in port and one every three days while at sea . " Willie glanced at the first assignment : Make two sketches of the Caine , port and starboard , showing every compartment and stating the use of each . " Where do we get this information , sir ? " " Did n't Carmody take you around the ship ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , just write down what he told you , in diagram form . " " Thank you , sir , " said Willie. 77Adams left the two ensigns to themselves . Harding murmured wearily , " What say ? Want to start on it ? " " Do you remember anything Carmody said ? " " Just one thing . Climb that mast ' " " Well , it 's due first thing in the morning , " Willie said . " Let 's have a go at it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fre- quent arguments about details . At the end of an hour their work looked like this : Willie sat back and examined it critically . " I think that does it --  " " Are you crazy , Keith ? There are about forty compartments we have to stick in a label  --  " " I do n't remember any of those bloody compartments --  " " Neither do I. Guess we 'll just have to go around the ship again --  " " What , for another three hours ? Man , I 'll get a heart attack . I'mfailing fast . Look , my hands are shaking --  " " Anyway , Keith , the whole thing 's out of proportion . It looks like some misbegotten tugboat --  " " It is . " " Look , I have an idea . There must be blueprints of this ship some- where . Why do n't we just get hold of them and --  It 's not cricket maybe but --  " " Say no more ! You 're a genius , Harding ! That 's it . We 'll do exactly that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hole . " " Right with you . " Outside the clip shack , under a brilliant yellow floodlight , some civilian yard workers were burning with blowtorches and sawing and banging at the deck , installing a new life-raft rack . Harding said , " How the devil can we sleep with that going on ? " " I could sleep , " said Willie , " if they were doing all that to me instead of to the deck . Let 's go . " He stepped into the shack and backed out , coughing like a consumptive . " Ye gods ! " " What 's the matter ? " " Go in there and take a breath  --  a shallow one . " The shack was full of stack gas . A shift in the wind was wafting the fumes from number-three stack directly into the little hut , where , having no place to go , they stayed and fermented . Harding took a sniff at the doorway and said , " Keith , it 's suicide to sleep in there --  " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , " I 'd just as lief die , all things considered . " He crept into his bunk , holding his nose , and Harding followed . For a couple of hours he tossed and thrashed in an eerie doze full of nightmares , wakened every few minutes by a burst of clattering from the workmen . Harding passed into a dead stupor . At midnight the workmen quit , but the sudden quiet and gloom brought no relief ; it merely made Willie more conscious of the heat , and of the stinking miasma of the stack gas . He staggered out on deck in his drawers , stumbled down to the wardroom , and passed out on the couch . His body was covered with soot . And again  --  and this was to be his most characteristic experience aboard the Caine , and his longest memory of it  --  he was being shaken out of his sleep . Lieutenant Adams was standing over him , dressed for a watch with gun belt and pistol , sipping coffee . Willie sat up . Through the porthole he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've got the four-to-eight . " Willie went back to the clipping shack , got into his clothes , and dragged himself to the quarterdeck . Adams gave him a gun belt , showed him the leather-bound logs and battered Watch Officers ' Guide which were kept in a rickety tin desk by the gangway , and introducedhim to the quartermaster and messenger of the watch , two sleepy sailors in dungarees . The clock on the desk under the shaded yellow electric bulb read five past four . All the ships in the nest were dark and still . " The four-to-eight is a pretty routine watch , " said Adams . " That 's good . " Willie yawned . " I do n't know , " said the gunnery officer , " but what I 'll lay below till reveille . Think you can handle it ? " " LTh-huh . " " Fine . There 's nothing to it , really , except making damn sure none of your watch-standers sit down or fall asleep standing up . There are guards on the fo'c'sle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Willie , saluting . Adams returned the salute and left . The messenger , a small seaman first class named Mackenzie , promptly sat down on a crate of cabbages , with a happy sigh . Willie was stupefied by this defiance . " Get up , Mackenzie , " he said uncertainly . " Aw , why ? I 'm here if you need me for a messenger . Hell , sir , " said Mackenzie , with an ingratiating smile , leaning back comfortably , " you78 79do n't have to pay no attention to Lieutenant Adams . He 's the only officer that makes us stand up . Captain de Vriess do n't care . " Willie suspected that this was a lie . He glanced at the gangway petty officer , Engstrand , a tall broad-shouldered first-class signalman , who was leaning against the desk , enjoying the byplay with a toothy grin . " If you 're not on your feet in two seconds , " said Willie , " you 're on report . " Mackenzie got up at once , muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Willie was too embarrassed to object further . " I 'm going to inspect the guards , " he said . " Aye aye , sir , " said Engstrand . On the forecastle , where a pleasant breeze blew and the night was blazing with stars , Willie found the guard curled up against the anchor windlass , his gun across his knees , fast asleep . This really shocked him . He had learned at Fumald Hall that the penalty for sleeping on watch in wartime was the firing squad . " Hey you , " he yelled , " wake up . " The guard was oblivious . Willie poked him with a toe , then shook him fiercely . The guard yawned and stood , shouldering his rifle . " Do you know , " barked Willie , " what the penalty is for sleeping on watch ? " " Who was sleeping ? " said the guard , with sincere outrage . " I was sending Morse code mentally . " Willie wanted to put this felon on report , but he hated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing , stay on your feet and do n't do it again . " " I was on my feet , " said the guard angrily . " Just crouching to keep warm . " Willie left in disgust to inspect the guard at the stern . He passed the quarterdeck and found Mackenzie supine on a pile of life jackets . " Hell 's fire , " he shouted . " Get up , Mackenzie ! Engstrand , ca n't you keep this man standing up ? " " Sir , I 'm sick , " moaned Mackenzie , sitting up . " I had a rough liberty . " " He is in bad shape , sir , " said Engstrand , with a slight smile . " Well , get someone else to stand the watch , then . " " Hell , sir , the whole crew is in terrible shape , " replied Engstrand . " Get up , Mackenzie ! " roared Willie . Mackenzie pulled himself up on his feet , with ghastly moans . " Okay , stay that way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep on the deck , curled in a ball like a dog . " Jesus , what a ship , " Willie muttered , and gave the guard a tremendous kick in the ribs . The guard jumped up , seized his rifle , and came to attention . Then he peered at Willie incredulously. 8o " Holy cats , " he muttered , " I thought sure you was Mr. Maryk . " " I 'm Mr. Keith , " said Willie , " and what 's your name ? " " Fuller . " " Well , Fuller , if I ever find you off your feet again on watch you get a general court-martial , do you hear ? " " Sure , " said Fuller affably . " Say , are you from the Academy like Mr. Carmody ? " " No . " Willie returned to the quarterdeck . Mackenzie was asleep on the life jackets again , and Engstrand was sitting on a hatch , smoking a cigar . He rose hastily when he saw Willie . " Sorry , sir . Just taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie . He was exhausted , enraged , and sick at the stomach . " And you a first-class petty officer . Three cheers for the good ship Caine . Look , Engstrand , you can sit , lie , or drop dead , for all I care , but keep this horizontal bastard on his feet for the rest of the watch , or I swear I 'll put you on report . " " Get up , Mackenzie , " said Engstrand , in a dry crisp tone . The sailor sprang off the life jackets , walked to the rail , and leaned against it , staring sullenly . Willie went to the desk and opened the Watch Officers ' Guide with trembling hands , waiting for Mackenzie 's next move . But the sailor stood in the same place for ten minutes , and seemed to find no difficulty at all in standing . At last he spoke up . " All right with you , Mr. Keith , " he said , with no rancor , " if I smoke ? " Willie nodded . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em yourself ? " " Thanks . " Mackenzie lit Willie 's cigarette , and then , to seal the good-fellowship thus established , he began to tell the new ensign about his sex career in New Zealand . Willie had heard some pretty frank talk late at night in college bedrooms , but Mackenzie 's explicitness was something new . Willie was first amused , then disgusted , then fiercely bored , but there seemed no way to turn off the sailor 's cloacal drone . The sky paled , and a dull streak of red appeared on the horizon . Willie was profoundly grateful when Lieutenant Adams came out of the wardroom hatchway , rubbing his eyes . " How 's it going , Keith ? Any strain ? " " No , sir . " " Let 's inspect the lines . " He walked around the ship with Willie , kicking the manila ropes that tied the Caine to the next destroyers . " This number-three line needs chafing gear , the chock is rubbing . Tell Engstrand . " " Yes , sir --  Mr. Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guards and the messenger from flaking out . " 8iAdams grinned wryly , then his face became long and stern . " That 's damned serious . " " They did n't seem to think so . " Adams pursed his lips , and stopped to light a cigarette , leaning against the life lines . " Tell you what , Keith . You 've got something to contend with . This ship has been in the forward area since March ' 42 . It 's been through a lot of action . The men are all Asiatic . They probablythink a fantail watch in Pearl Harbor is foolishness . The trouble is , the skipper thinks so , too . It 's the port director 's orders , so we post the guards . You 've just got to bear down . " " What actions were you in , sir ? " " Hell , about everything . Marshalls raid , Coral Sea  --  first Savo , second Savo  --  Rendova , Munda --  " " What were you doing  --  minesweeping ? " " Who ever heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine fliers at Henderson Field . Ran torpedoes up from New Zealand . That was a happy deal , live torpedoes lashed all over the deck and getting strafed . Ran dogfaces up to relieve the marines on Guadal . Ran convoys all over the ocean . Supply scow , troop transport , screen , mail carrier , or what dirty job have you ? That 's the Caine . So if she 's a little run down , you know why . " " A little run down is putting it politely , " said Willie . Adams straightened up , glared at him , threw his cigarette into the water , and walked aft . Over the loudspeaker came the chirp of the boatswain 's pipe , then the words , " Reveille for all hands . Reveille . " Adams snapped over his shoulder , " Check reveille in the after crew 's quarter , Keith . Make sure they 're all out of their sacks . " " Aye aye , sir . " Willie decided that he had better guard his mouth . Adams and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must be blind to the fact that it was a filthy wreck . They might even be proud of the ship . He swore to himself that he would be different . He would keep perspective , and he would never rest until , one way or another , he had gotten himself off the Caine . He set six months as his limit . After all , there was an admiral who was fond of him . A narrow round hatchway and a steep ladder led to the after crew 's quarters . Willie put his face to the opening and peered down . It was dark as a cave inside , and the smell was like a very hot and dirty gymnasium . Willie lowered himself through the hatchway and shouted , trying to use a fierce tone , " All right ! What the hell about reveille , here ? " A light snapped on in a far corner , revealing tiers of shadowy bunks full of sleepers . " Aye aye , sir , " spoke a lone voice , " I 'm the master-at-82arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear reveille called away , sir . Come on , you guys  --  up ! There 's an officer here . " A few naked sailors rolled out of the bunks , but the response was sluggish and small . The master-at-arms turned on a brilliant central light , and went from one tier of bunks to another , shaking , poking , pleading . The sailors were stacked like corpses in a mausoleum . Willie was ashamed of intruding on their wretchedness . The deck was as nasty as a chicken yard with butts , papers , clothing , and moldering scraps of food . The fetid air sickened him . " Hurry it , " he said . He fled up the ladder . " How 's it going back there ? " said Adams when he returned to the quarterdeck . The sun was shining , and boatswain 's pipes and loudspeaker'scalls were filling the air in the repair basin . Barefoot sailors were hosing down the deck . " They 're getting up , " said Willie . Adams nodded satirically . " Excellent . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coffee . " " Aye aye , sir . " Willie took off the gun belt , and his haunches felt pleasantly light . In the wardroom the officers were already at breakfast . Willie fell into his chair and ate what was placed before him , not knowing or caring what it was . He wanted to fill his gnawing stomach and return to the clip shack and stay there for the day , stack gas or no stack gas . " Say , Keith , " said the communications officer , buttering a roll , " I saw Roland last night . Says he 's coming out here later today to pay us a visit . " " Swell , " said Willie . " We 've gotten kind of stacked up on messages , by the way , " added Keefer . " How 's about decoding for a couple of hours after breakfast ? " " Love it , " said Willie , a little desperately . Captain de Vriess looked up at him from under thick blond eyebrows . " What 's the trouble , Keith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " exclaimed Willie . " I 'm glad to have something to do . " " Fine . Ambition becomes an ensign . " An hour later , as Willie toiled over a decoding device spread out on the wardroom table , the letters suddenly became a blur . The wardroomjerked back and forth , and began to rotate gently . His head fell on his hands . The fact that Lieutenant Maryk was reading official mail at the table beside him made no difference . He was done in . He heard the opening of a door , and then the captain 's voice : " Well , well . Siesta time for Ensign Keith . " He did not dare raise his head. 83 " Sir , " he heard Maryk say , " that clip shack is no place to sleep . The kid is shot . " " Kind of ripe in port , but it 'll be fine under way . Hell , Maryk , this boy 's had four months ' temporary in Pearl . Like to know how the hell he arranged it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go without for a month . " The captain 's voice was mocking and cruel . It filled Willie with rage . What right had De Vriess to be so damned red hot ? De Vriess was the man who permitted all the filth and sloth of the Caine , for which he deserved a court-martial . He seemed to reserve all his energies for baiting ensigns . Willie 's accumulated resentment , weariness , and dis- gust coagulated at that moment into hatred of Captain de Vriess . The ship was the measure of the commanding officer . He had fallen into the hands of a bullying stupid sloven . He gritted his teeth , and as soon as De Vriess was gone he pulled himself erect and resumed decoding with new energy released by hate . There was an enormous pile-up of coding traffic . He had to keep working until lunch time , and then for an hour after that . At last it was done . He dropped the decodes on Keefer 's cluttered desk , went aft to the clipping shack , and fell asleep instantaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keith , you have visitors in the wardroom --  " " Huh  --  visitors ? " " Keefer 's brother , and two of the prettiest nurses I 've ever seen . Lucky boy --  " Willie sat up , suddenly refreshed . " Thank you , sir . Sir , what 's the procedure for getting off the ship ? " " You check out with the senior watch officer  --  me . " " Thank you , sir . I 'd like to check out . " Willie reached for his clothes . " Sure . Just let me have the assignment . " Willie had to search his memory . Through the cloud of recent hap- penings came a dim recollection of the officers ' qualification course . " I have n't had time to touch it , sir . " " Sorry , Keith . Better clear with the skipper , then . Orders are that assignments must be up to date prior to any shore leave . " Willie dressed and went down to the wardroom . He found the cap- tain , in smart tropical khakis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Keefer brothers . He disliked begging permission like a schoolboy in the presence of the girls , but there was no help for it . " Pardon me , Captain . " " Yes , Keith ? " " I request permission to go ashore . " 84 " Of course . I would n't think of depriving you of such charming company , " said the captain with elephantine gallantry . The nurses giggled . Miss Jones said , " Hi , Keither . " " Thank you , sir . " " I presume you 've checked out with Adams ? " " Well , that 's it , sir . That 's why I 'm checking with you . " The captain gave him a quizzical look . " See , there 's an assignment in my qualificationcourse I have n't completed . It was handed to me yesterday and I 've been on the go every second since and  --  " " Every second ? Seems to me I 've seen you at rest once or twice . What were you doing just now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of sleep in the past fortyeight , sir --  " " Well , why do n't you sit down and bat that assignment out now ? It wo n't take long . The girls will wait . I 'll do my best to amuse them . " " The sadist , " said Willie to himself . Aloud , " Thank you , Captain , but  --  " " I 'll give you a ti-ip , " said De Vriess , in a teasing singsong . " The sketches you need are right up there in the ship 's organization book . All you have to do is trace them . That 's all I did in my day . " He resumedhis chitchat with the girls , who seemed fascinated by him . Willie took down the book and found the sketches . He calculated that it would require three quarters of an hour to trace the diagrams and copy the names of the spaces . " Pardon me , Captain . " " Yes ? " said De Vriess pleasantly . " This being a purely mechanical chore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I promise to turn it in prior to o800 tomorrow ? I can do it tonight . " " No telling what shape you 'll be in tonight , Keith . Better do it now . " The nurses laughed , and Miss Jones said , " Poor Keither . " " Use my room , Keith , " said the communicator . " There 's a ruler andtracing paper in my upper right-hand drawer . " Blushing , seething , Willie bolted from the wardroom . " War is hell , " he heard the captain say , and the girls gurgled . Willie made the sketches in twenty minutes , grinding his teeth each time he heard feminine laughter from the wardroom . With the papers in his hand he climbed up on deck through a scuttle to avoid the captain and the girls , and went looking for Adams . But the senior watch officer had left the ship . There was no help for it ; Willie had to go below and , his cheeks flaming , hand the sketches to the captain . De Vriess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very nice , " he said 85after a long , humiliating pause . " A little hasty , but under the circumstances , very nice . " Brief giggle by Nurse Carter . " May I go now , sir ? " " Why not ? " said the captain magnanimously . He rose . " May I give you people a lift ? I have a station wagon . " " No , thank you , sir , " Willie growled . The captain raised his eyebrows . " No ? Too bad . Good-by , Miss Carter  --  Miss Jones . Very pleasant having you aboard . " He walked out , putting on his hat with a self-satisfied tilt . The party that followed was a dampened one . Willie covered his fury with a dull silence . The girls found little to say . In Honolulu they picked up a third nurse earmarked for Tom Keefer , an extravagantly stupid , beautiful blonde . She displayed a marked and instant liking for Roland . Tom retreated into long drunken quotations from Paradise Lost and the poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blonde carried on a boisterous flirtation . This was duringdinner at a Chinese restaurant . Willie drank more than he ever had in his life . They went on to a Danny Kaye movie at CincPac , which he saw blurrily , as through a rainy window . He fell sound asleep in the middle of it ; and never really woke , though he walked obediently wherever he was led , until he found himself riding in a taxi with Tom Keefer . " Where are we ? What time is it ? Where are the others ? " hegrumbled . His mouth tasted sickeningly of rum and Chinese food . " We 're on the way home , Willie . Home to the Caine . Party 's over . " " The Caine . The Caine and De Vriess  --  " " Afraid so . " " Mr. Keefer , am I wrong , or is De Vriess a complete lout and moron ? " " Your estimate is a little generous , otherwise correct . " " How does such a man get command of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's commanding the Caine . " " He 's made the Caine what it is . " " Very likely . " " Say , where 's Roland ? " " Out getting married to the blonde . I hope so , anyway . He ought to make an honest woman of her after what they were doing at that movie . " " He sure cut in on you . " " Roland is n't responsible , " said Keefer , " for the deeds that his thyroidputs him up to . It 's a classic instance of what Kant calls arbitrium brutum . You recall the passage , no doubt . " 86 " Of course , " said Willie , and fell asleep again . Keefer led him aboard the Caine and dumped him into the clipping shack . Willie was only half aware of what was happening . An hour later he was being shaken out of his sleep . He opened his eyes and looked into the face of Paynter . " Whassamatter now ? " he mumbled . " Message to be broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Quarter past three . " " Jesus , ca n't it wait till morning ? " " Nope . Caine is information addressee . Any message where we 're an addressee is busted at once . Captain de Vriess 's orders . " " De Vriess , " snarled Willie . " De Vriess . Why does n't the Navy send him back to high school to mature ? " " Come on , Keith . " " Pal , let someone else break it . I 'm too tired to see . " " Assistant communicator always handles these night breaks , " said Paynter , " as I know only too goddam well . Come on , Keith , I 've got to get back to the gangway . ' Willie slid out of the bunk and descended to the wardroom , leaning heavily on bulkheads and railings . He propped his spinning head on one arm and set about decoding . The message was addressed to the aircraft carrier Brandywine Creek for action . Halfway through the message Willie jumped up and uttered a cry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drained it , and raced through the rest of the decoding . With the penciled message he ran up to the quarterdeck , threw his arms around Paynter , and kissed him . The dour engineer pushed him away in distaste . " What the hell ? " " Look , friend , look . Tidings of comfort and joy . " Paynter took the slip of paper to the light over the desk . Shielding it from the side glances of the watch , he read : Lieutenant Commander Philip F. Queeg USN detached . Proceed to Anti-submarine Warfare School San Francisco for training . Upon completion proceed to relieve Commanding Officer Caine DMS 22 . Paynter looked mildly pleased . " Well , " said Willie in a low tone , standing beside him , " are n't you going to kiss me back ? " " I 'll wait , " said Paynter , " until I see this Queeg . " " When you 're at the bottom , there 's no place to go but up , " said Willie . " Can you imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's conceivable . I 'll take this in to the skipper -- - " " No , no , allow me that luxury . " Willie ran down the ladder to the wardroom and rapped at the captain 's door. 87 " Come in --  " " Good news , Captain , " cried Willie , as he opened the door . The captain snapped on his bed light and squinted at the message , leaning on an elbow , his face streaked with red marks from the creases of his pillow . " Well , well , " he said , with a small wry smile . " Call that good news , do you , Keith ? " " I guess it is for you , sir , after six years . You 'll probably get a new destroyer . Maybe shore duty . " " You 're all for shore duty , eh , Keith ? That 's a thoroughly salty viewpoint . You 've picked it up real quickly . " " Why , I sort of think you rate it , sir , that 's all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks , Keith . Good night . " Willie left with a feeling that his sarcasm had somehow bounced off the captain 's hide . But he did n't care . He could suffer through the next weeks on the Caine gladly now . Deliverance was on the way , in the person of Lieutenant Commander Philip F. Queeg. 9 FIRST DAY AT SEAAfter four days of repairs , the Caine was ordered to sea for minesweepingexercises in waters near Oahu . " Well , well , " said Captain de Vriess , when Willie brought him the decoded message , " minesweeping , eh ? Looks like our friend Queeg will be relieving me just in time . " " Does that mean we 're going to minesweep for real in  --  in the near future , sir ? " " Could be . " " Has the Caine ever done any sweeping , sir ? " " Sure , dummy mines by the hundreds . Never in any operation , thank God . " De Vriess climbed out of his bunk and reached for his trousers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out one simple problem . " " What 's that , sir ? " " Who sweeps ahead of the minesweepers  --  Well , tell Steve Maryk to come in here , will you ? And tell Whittaker I 'd like some coffee . " " Yes , sir . " 88 " Not the black tar that 's been cooking down since this morning . Fresh . " " Yes , sir . " Roland Keefer came aboard that evening for dinner , bringing a batch of mail for Willie from the BOQ . As usual , Willie ripped open May 's letter first . She had returned to college for the autumn session . It was a sacrifice , for during the summer Marty Rubin had obtained a midday radio booking for her , and she might have continued on it . The pay was a hundred dollars a week . But I do n't care , dear . The more I read and study , the less ambitiousI become . Last year I was sure I wanted nothing in life but a top salary as a top singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first because they could n't earn a nickel . But I 'm beginning to wonder whether it 's sensible to give up all my days and nights for a salary . I love to sing , I guess I always will . As long as I have to earn money I 'm glad I can do it at a fair rate in work I enjoy rather than as a typist in some stale office . But I know I 'll never be a first-rate singer  --  have n't the voice , have n't the style , have n't the looks ( no , I have n't , dear ) . What I want now , I think , is to trap some kindhearted sugar daddy who will help me have a couple of babies and otherwise let me read in peace . Score one for you , my love . Dickens is terri f . Sat up all night reading Dombey and Son  --  for a book report , mind you , that is n't due till next week  --  and now have huge black bags under my eyes . Glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last sentence is . Are you ever coming home ? When is this war going to end ? I thought after Italy surrendered that I 'd be seeing you any day . But it seems to be bogging down for another long stretch . The European news is usually good but I 'm afraid I care mostly about the Pacific . And it may be unpatriotic , but I 'm awfully glad you have n't caught the Caine yet . I love you . MAY " Well , " said Roland as they sat down to dinner , " looks like I 'll be saying good-by to you all for a while . Staff 's piling aboard the Yorktowntomorrow . Guess the admiral wants some sea pay . " Tom Keefer 's face darkened . He threw down his knife and fork . " Would n't you know . A new flattop . " " That hurts , does n't it , Tom ? " said DeVriess , grinning . " What 's the matter , Tom ? " said Maryk . " Do n't you like minesweeping ? " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89 " Hell , I just want to see some war , as long as my sands are running out uselessly  --  " " You came aboard too late , " said Adams . " We saw plenty of war before --  " " You saw some errand-boy duty , " said Keefer . " I 'm interested in essences , not accidents . The nub of this Pacific war is the duel of flying machines . Everything else is as routine as the work of milkmen and filing clerks . All uncertainty and all decision rides with the carriers . " " I 've got some friends on the Saratoga , " said the captain . " Pretty routine life aboard her , too , Tom . " " War is ninety-nine per cent routine  --  routine that trained monkeys could perform , " said Keefer . " But the one per cent of chance and creative action on which the history of the world is hanging right now you 'll find on carriers . That 's what I want to be part of . So my dear brother , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawaii for the rest of the war  --  " " Tom , you are but so right , " threw in Roland cheerfully. "  --  gets carted aboard a carrier on a silver charger , and I ride the Caine . " " Have some more liver , Tom , " said Maryk . The first lieutenant , who resembled a prize fighter or drill sergeant with his bullet head , short wide nose , and close-clipped hair , had a surprisingly innocent , affectionatesmile which changed his whole appearance . " Why do n't you send in another transfer request , Tom ? " said the captain . " I 'll approve it again . " " I 've given up . This ship is an outcast , manned by outcasts , and named for the great outcast of mankind . My destiny is the Caine . It 's the purgatory for my sins . " " Any interesting sins , Tom ? Tell us about ' em , " said Gorton , leering over a heavy forkful of liver . " Sins that would make even the naked whores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raising a hoot of laughter at the exec . The captain regarded Keefer admiringly . " That 's the literary mind for you . I never thought of Caine being a symbolic name --  " " The extra e threw you off , Captain . God always likes to veil his symbolsa bit , being , among His other attributes , the perfect literary artist . " " Well , I 'm glad I stayed aboard for dinner , " said Maryk . " You have n't opened up for a long while , Tom . Been off your form . " " He just got tired of casting his pearls befor swine , " said the captain . " Let 's have the ice cream , Whittaker . " Willie had noticed a curious mixture of respect and satire in the captain 's attitude toward Tom Keefer . He was beginning to realize that the wardroom was a tangle of subtle , complex evaluations by the90officers of each other , knotting centrally , as it were , in the person and attitudes of the captain . It seemed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subordinate so much more cultured and gifted than himself . Yet somehow De Vriess struck a note with Keefer that enabled him to use an amiable condescension , where he had no right to condescend . Harding broke his accustomed silence to remark , " Friend of mine was sent to a destroyer called the Abel . Wonder what you 'd say if you were aboard her , Mr. Keefer ? " " I 'd probably say that I was sacrificing my first fruits aboard her , as God knows I am here , and had some hope they 'd be acceptable , " rejoinedKeefer . ' What first fruits , Tom ? ' said Gorton . " My young years , my early vigor , the time in which Sheridan producedThe Rivals , and Dickens , Pickwick , and Meredith , Richard Feverel . What am I producing ? A lot of decodes and registered pub inventories . My freshness is spending its wavering shower in the dust . At least if I were on a carrier  --  " " You stole that line , " said Willie proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exploded the captain , " this ship is becoming a damned literary society . I 'm glad I 'm getting off . " " Well , it seems to me , Mr. Keefer , " said Harding , " that you can twist any ship 's name into a symbolical meaning . Caine , Abel --  " " The world is an endless treasury of symbols , " said Keefer . " That 's grade-school theology . " I think Harding means that you 're an endless treasury of plays on words , " said Willie . " Salvo for the junior ensign , " cried Gorton , signaling with a fat forefingerfor a third helping of ice cream . " All intelligent conversation is playing on words , " said Keefer . " The rest is definitions and instructions . " " What I mean , " persisted Harding , " you can go on spinning those symbols forever , and one 's as good as another --  " " Not quite , " said Keefer , with a brief nod of appreciation at the point , " because the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it 's rooted in reality . What I said about the Abel was a specious verbalism to answer you . But you see I am aboard the Caine . " " Then we 're all outcasts for our sins , " said Willie . " Hell , what sins ? Keith looks as though butter would n't melt in his mouth , " said Maryk . " Look at that sweet face . " " Who knows ? Maybe he robbed his mother 's purse once , " said Keefer . " Sin is relative to character . " " Wonder what I ever did , " said Gorton. 91 " It 's hard to know what would be sin in a born degenerate , " said Keefer . " You probably worship Satan in that private stateroom . " " I , " said the captain , rising , " am going to see that Hopalong Cassidy movie on the Johnson . Tom gives me mental indigestion . " The Caine left Pearl Harbor at dawn in a rain squall . The light was still dim on the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ready in all respects to get under way , Captain ! " Willie , stationed on the bridge as junior OOD , was utterly bewildered by the rapid reports and orders which went before this word . He stood out in the warm rain in his khakis , shielding his binocularsunder his arm , denying himself the protection of the pilothouse in the vague intention of demonstrating that he was a real seaman . Captain de Vriess came up the ladder . He paced the bridge slowly , leaning over the bulwarks to look at the lines , estimating the wind , peering astern at the channel , issuing brief orders in a dry pleasant tone . His bearing was very impressive , Willie admitted to himself , because it was natural , perhaps unconscious . It was not a matter of a stiff spine , squared shoulders , and a sucked-in stomach . Knowledge was in his eye , authority in his manner , decision in the sharp lines of his mouth . " Well , hell , " Willie thought , " if a destroyer captain ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for ? " He had already adopted the Caine mode of shading the truth toward the glamorous side by regarding the ship as an honest-to-goodness destroyer . His meditations were interrupted by a shocking blast on the ship 's steam whistle . The stern of the destroyer next to the Caine swung away sluggishly , pulled by a small tug , leaving a narrow triangle of open water bubbling under the rain . " Take in all lines to port , " said the captain . A goateed sailor named Grubnecker , who wore headphones , reported in a moment , " All lines taken in fore and aft , sir . " " Port back one third , " said the captain . The fat ship 's yeoman at the engine telegraph , Jellybelly , repeated the order and rang it up . The engine-room pointer answered . The ship began to vibrate , and slowly to move backward . Willie had an intuitive flash that this was a historic moment , his first time under way aboard the Caine . But he pushed it from his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life  --  he was determined to see to that . " Stand clear of the bulkhead , Mr. Keith , " said De Vriess sharply , leaning over the side . " Beg pardon , sir , " said Willie , leaping aside . He mopped the streamingrain from his face . " All engines stop , " ordered De Vriess . He walked past Willie , remarking , " Do n't you know enough to get in out of the rain ? Go in the pilothouse . " " Thank you , sir . " He took shelter gladly . A stiff wind was slanting the rain across the channel . Drops drummed on the windows of the wheelhouse . " Fantail reports channel buoy a hundred yards dead astern , " called Grubnecker . " I see it , " said the captain . Maryk , in a dripping mackintosh , peered down the channel through binoculars . " Submarine coming down the channel , Captain . Making ten knots . Distance one thousand . " " Very well . " " Fantail reports battle wagon and two tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the telephone talker . " Forty-second Street and Broadway out here today , " said De Vriess . Willie looked out at the choppy channel , thinking that the Caine was in difficulties already . The wind was moving her swiftly down on the channel buoy . There was little space to maneuver between the bobbing buoy and the ships in the docks . The battleship and the submarine were rapidly closing from both sides , De Vriess , unperturbed , issued a swift series of engine and rudder orders , the purpose of which escaped Willie . But the effect was to swing the minesweeper around in a backing arc , heading down-channel , well clear of the buoy , falling in line behind the departing submarine . Meantime the battleship and its escorts passed down the port side with plenty of room . Willie observed that none of the sailors commentedor seemed impressed , so he assumed that what had appeared knotty to him was a matter of course to an experienced seaman . Maryk stepped into the pilothouse and swabbed his face with a towel hung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather . " He noticedWillie standing around , looking uncommonly useless . " What the devil are you doing in here ? You 're supposed to stand lookout on the starboard side --  " " Captain told me to get in out of the rain . " " " Hell , you probably were under his feet . Come on out . You wo n't melt . " " Gladly , sir . " Willie followed him out into the weather , irritated at being in the wrong whatever he did . " Learn anything , " asked Maryk , peering down-channel , " from that backing maneuver ? " " Seemed pretty routine , " said Willie . Maryk dipped his binoculars and looked at Willie , showing all his92 93teeth in a mystified grin . " You ever been on a bridge before , Keith ? " " No , sir . " Maryk nodded , and resumed his search of the channel through the glasses . " Why , " said Willie , wiping rain from his eyes , " was there anything remarkable about it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Any ensign could have handled the ship the way the old man did . I thought maybe you were impressed for no good reason . " He grinned again and walked to the other side of the bridge . The squall passed and the sun came out brilliantly as the Caine cleared the channel entrance . When Willie came off watch he went to the forecastle to enjoy the view of Diamond Head and Oahu 's green hills . The ship knifed through calm blue water at twenty knots . He was agreeably surprised at the old minesweeper 's brisk speed . There were traces of destroyer grandeur yet in the rusty ruin . The deck rolled steeply , and sparkling spray flew up from the bow wave , and Willie was proud of not being in the least seasick . For the first time since his arrival on the Caine he felt moderately happy . But he made the mistake of going below for a cup of coffee . Keefer captured him and set him to work correcting publications . This was the dreariest of all communication chores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paste , and the interminable niggling corrections : " Page 9 para . 0862 line 3 : change All prescribed gunnery exercises to read All gunnery exercises prescribed by USNF 7A . " He had visions of thousands of ensigns all over the globe straining their eyes and crooking their backs over these preposterous trifles . The motion of the ship , heaving the green table up and down as he bent over it , began to trouble him . He noticed with annoyance that some of the corrections which Keefer had dumped on him in a heap were very old . Several of them he had himself entered in CincPac 's books , months ago . At one point he threw down the pen with an exclamationof disgust . He had spent an hour minutely entering a set of ink corrections which were obsolete ; further down in the pile there were new printed pages to replace them . " Damn , " he said to Carmody , who was decoding messages beside him , " does n't Keefer ever enter corrections ? These things are piled up since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his novel , " burst out Carmody bitterly , stroking his faint mustache . " What novel ? " " He 's writing some kind of novel . Half the time at night when I 'm trying to sleep he 's pacing around talking to himself . Then in the daytimehe flakes out . Why , he can work these damn decoding gismosten times faster than anybody in the wardroom . He spent six months on the beach studying them . He could clear up the whole traffic in a couple of hours a day . But we 're always behind , and you , Rabbitt and I are clearing about ninety per cent of it . I think he 's a foul ball . " " Have you read any of the novel ? " " Hell , I have no time to read novels by good authors . Why should I bother with his tripe ? " Carmody twisted his blue-and-gold Annapolis ring nervously with his thumb . He rose and poured himself coffee . " Want some Joe ? " " Thanks  --  Well , look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of thing must be horribly dull to a man of his talents . " " What talents ? " Carmody dropped into a chair . " He 's a professional author , Carmody . Did n't you know that ? He 's had stories in magazines . The Theatre Guild had an option on one of his plays --  " " So what ? He 's on the Caine now , just like you and me . " " If he brings a great novel off the Caine , " said Willie , " it 'll be a far greater contribution to America than a lot of decodes . " " His assignment is communications , not contributions to Amer-ica  --  - Keefer entered the wardroom in underwear and went to the coffee corner . " How are you doing , lads ? " " All right , sir , " said Carmody with sudden subservience , pushing away his coffee cup and taking up a coded message . " Except we think you ought to do some decoding for a change , " said Willie . He had no fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicator laughed at such gradings . His respect for Keefer , already high , had risen sharply on learning that he was composinga novel . Keefer smiled and came to the table . " What 's the matter , class of ' 43 , " he said , slouching in a chair , " want to go talk to the chaplain ? " Carmody kept his eyes down . " The coding watch is part of an ensign'swork on a small ship , " he said . " I do n't mind . Every line officer should learn the essentials of communications , and --  " " Here , " said Keefer , draining his coffee , " give me that gismo . I 've been doping off . Go study Navy Regulations . " He pried the device out of Carmody 's hands . " No , I can do it , sir . Happy to --  " " Run along . " " Why , thank you , sir . " Carmody rose , bestowed a brief arid smile on Keith , and went out . " There goes a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine through its motions . It was as Carmody had said . He was incredibly fast . " He tells me you 're working on a novel . " Keefer nodded . " Got much of it done ? " " About forty thousand words out of four hundred thousand . " " Gosh . Long . " " Longer than Ulysses . Shorter than War and Peace . " " Is it a war novel ? " Keefer smiled ironically . " It takes place on a carrier . " " Got a title ? " " Well , a working title . " " What is it ? " said Willie very curiously . " Does n't mean much , by itself . " " Well , I 'd like to hear it . " Keefer hesitated , and spoke the words slowly . " Multitudes , Multi-tudes . " " I like it . " " Recognize it ? " " Bible , I imagine . " " Book of Joel . Multitudes , multiudes in the valley of decision . ' " " Well , I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Keefer gave him the whole-souled smile of a flattered author . " I'ma little way from that , yet . " " You 'll make it . May I read some of it ? " " Perhaps . When it 's in better shape . " Keefer had never stopped decoding . He finished his third message and began a fourth . " You really whiz through those , " marveled Willie . " Perhaps that 's why I let ' em pile up . It 's like telling a child Red Riding Hood for the thousandth time . The thing is infantile and dull to start with , and becomes maddening with repetition . " " Most of the Navy is repetition . " " I do n't mind it , when there 's only fifty per cent waste motion . Communicationis ninety-eight per cent waste motion . We carry a hundred and twelve registered publications . We use about six . But all the rest have to be corrected , one set of corrections superseding another every month . Take decoding . Actually about four messages a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , for instance . The minesweeping-exercise despatch . All the rest of this garbage we rake over because the captain , bless his intellectual curiosity , wants to snoop on the fleet 's activities . For only one reason . So that at the officers ' club he can say to some classmate of his , very casually , do n't you know , Well , I hope you like screening that southern attack group in the nextpush . ' Makes him sound like a friend of the admirals . I 've seen him do it a dozen times . " He kept racing through the decoding steps as he talked . Willie was fascinated by his negligent speed . Already he had done more work than Willie could perform in an hour ; and Willie was the speediest of the ensigns . " I ca n't get over the way you polish those off . " " Willie , are n't you wise to the Navy yet ? It 's all child 's play . The work has been fragmentized by a few excellent brains at the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment . The assumption is sound enough for peacetime . There 's a handful of brilliant boys who come into the Navy with the long purpose of becomingthe nation 's admirals , and they succeed invariably because there 's no competition . For the rest the Navy is a third-rate career for third-rate people , offering a sort of skimpy security in return for twenty or thirty years of a polite penal servitude . What self-respecting Americanof even average gifts , let alone superior ones , will enter such a life ? Well , now , comes a war , and the gifted civilians swarm into the service . Is it any wonder that they master in a matter of weeks what the nearmoronspainfully acquire in years ? Take code devices . Navy plodders grind out maybe five , six messages an hour with them . Any half-baked reserve communicator can learn to whip out twenty an hour . No wonderthe poor peons resent us  --  " " Hersey , heresy , " Willie said , rather startled and embarrassed . " Not at all . Plain fact . Whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fragment of gunnery  --  you 'll find them all predigested and regulated to a point where you 'd have to search the insane asylums to find people who could muff the jobs . Remember that one point . It explains , and reconciles you to , all the Navy Regulations , and all the required reports , and all the emphasis on memory and obedience , and all the standardized ways of doing things . The Navy is a master plan designed by geniuses for execution by idiots . If you 're not an idiot , but find yourself in the Navy , you can only operate well by pretending to be one . All the shortcuts and economies and commonsensechanges that your native intelligence suggests to you are mistakes . Learn to quash them . Constantly ask yourself , How would I do this if I were a fool ? ' Throttle down your mind to a crawl . Then you 'll never go wrong --  Well , that cleans up brother Carmody 's traffic , " he added , pushing aside the heap of despatches . " Want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir  --  You 're pretty bitter about the Navy --  " " No , no , Willie , " said Keefer earnestly . " I approve of the whole design . We need a navy , and there 's no other way to run one in a free society . It simply takes a little time to see the true picture , and I'm96 97passing on to you the fruits of my analysis . You have wit and background . You 'd come to the same conclusion in a few months . RememberSocrates ' slave who worked out the pons asinorum with a stick in the sand ? A fact of nature emerges by itself after a while . It would come pretty quickly to you . " " So that 's your pons asinorum of shipboard life ? The Navy is a master plan designed by geniuses for execution by idiots : " " An excellent demonstration , " Keefer smiled , nodding , " of obedient memory , Willie . You 'll be a naval officer yet . " A few hours later Willie was on the bridge again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozed in his narrow chair on the starboard side of the pilothouse . The remains of his lunch in a tin tray rested on the deck under the chair : a broken corn muffin , fragmentsof Swiss steak , and an empty coffee mug . The weather was clear and hot , the sea choppy with whitecaps . The Caine rolled and creaked , cutting across the troughs of the waves at fifteen knots . A telephone buzzed . Willie answered it . " Forward fireroom requests permission to blow tubes , " croaked the phone . Willie repeated the request to Maryk . " Granted , " said the OOD , after a glance at the fluttering flag on the mast . There was a rumble from the stacks and inky smoke billowed out and floated away perpendicularly to leeward . " Good time to blow tubes , " said Maryk . " Wind on the beam . Carries the soot well clear . Sometimes you have to change course to get the wind right . Then you ask the skipper 's permission . " The ship took a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid in a heap to one side . Willie clung to a window handle as the quartermaster rescued the mats . " Sure rolls with the wind on the beam , " he observed . " These buckets roll in drydock , " said Maryk . " Lot of freeboard forward and too much weight aft . All that sweep gear . Pretty poor stability . Wind on the beam really pushes her over . " He strolled out on the starboard wing , and Willie followed him , glad of the chance to let some fresh air blow in his face . The rolling bothered him in the narrow stuffy pilothouse . He decided he would do most of his watch-standing on these open wings . It would give him a nice sunburn . The first lieutenant peered constantly seaward , sometimes making a slow sweep of the horizon with his binoculars . Willie imitated him , but the sea was empty , and he soon became bored . " Mr. Maryk , " he said , " what do you think of Mr. Keefer ? " The first lieutenant gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " " Do you think he 's a good officer ? " Willie knew he was trampling 98on etiquette , but curiosity was too strong . The first lieutenant put his binoculars to his eyes . " Gets by , " he said , " like the rest of us . " " He does n't seem to think much of the Navy . " Maryk grunted . " Tom do n't think much of a lot of things . Get him started on the West Coast sometime . " " Are you from the West Coast ? " Maryk nodded . " Tom says it 's the last primitive area left for the anthropologists to study . He says we 're a lot of white tennis-playing Bushmen . " " What did you do before the war , sir ? " Maryk glanced uneasily at the dozing captain . " Fisherman . " " Commercial fishing ? " " Look , Keith , we 're not supposed to shoot the breeze on watch . If you have questions about the ship or the watch that 's a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Skipper 's easygoing about it . But it 's a good idea to keep your mind on the watch . " " Certainly , sir . There just was n't much happening , so --  " " When anything happens it generally happens fast . " " Aye aye , sir . " After a while Maryk said , " There they are . " " Where , sir ? " " One point to starboard . " Willie trained his glasses in that direction . Behind the iridescent edges of the empty waves there was nothing  --  except  --  he thought there might be two , no , three , faint black points like bristles on an unshaven chin . Maryk woke the captain . " Three cans hull down , sir , about three miles west of rendezvous . " The captain mumbled , " Okay , go to twenty knots and close ' em . " The three hairlines became masts , then the hulls appeared , and soon the ships were plain to see . Willie knew the silhouettes well : three stacks with an untidy gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; slanting flush deck ; two cranes crooked queerly over the stem . They were sister bastards to the Caine , destroyer-minesweepers . The captain stretched , and came out to the wing . " Well , which ones are they ? " The signalman Engstrand seized a long telescope and squinted atthe bow numbers . " Frobisher  --  " he said . " Jones  --  Moulton . " " Moulton ! " exclaimed the captain . " Look again . She 's in SoPac . " " DMS 21 , sir , " said Engstrand. 99 " What do you know . Duke Sammis with us again , hey ? Send ' em Greetings to the Iron Duke from De Vriess . " The signalman began blinking the shutter of a large searchlight mounted on the flagbag . Willie picked up the telescope and trained it on the Moulton . The three DMS 's were coming closer every minute . Willie thought he saw the long sad face of Keggs hanging over the rail on the bridge . " I know someone on the Moultonl " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation more cozy --  Keep the conn , Steve , and fall in a thousand yards aft of the Moulton , col- umn open order . " " Aye aye , sir . " Willie had been one of Furnald Hall 's champions of the blinker light . He was proud of his ability to send Morse at eight words a minute . Nothing seemed more natural than for him to take the shut ter handle , when Engstrand relinquished it , and start blinking at the Moulton . He wanted to greet Keggs , and he also thought that his prowess at Morse might cause the captain to think a little more highly of him . The signalmen  --  Engstrand and two assistants  --  stared at him , appalled . " Do n't worry , my lads , " he said . " I can send . " How like sail- ors it was , he thought , to hug their little accomplishments , and resent an officer who could match them. em . The Moulton returned his call . He began spelling out " H-E-L-L-O K-E-G-GS  --  W-H-A-T A --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his ear , " what are you doing ? " Willie stopped blinking , resting his hand on the shutter lever . " Just saying hello to my friend , sir , " he replied blandly . " I see . Get your hand off that light , please . " " Yes , sir . " He complied with a yank . The captain took a long breath , expelled it slowly , then spoke in patient tones . " I should make some- thing clear to you , Mister Keith . The communication facilities of a ship have nothing in common with a public pay telephone . Only one person aboard this ship has the authority to originate messages , and that is myself , so hereafter  --  " " This was in no sense an official message , sir . Just hello --  " " Confound it , Keith , you wait till I 'm through talking ! Whenever this ship breaks radio or visual silence for any reason whatever , with any manner of signal whatever , that is an official communication for which I and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm sorry , sir . I just did n't know , but  --  " De Vriess turned and snarled at the signalman , " Damn it to hell , Engstrand , are you asleep on watch ? This light is your responsibility . " " I know , sir . " Engstrand hung his head . " The fact that some officer happens to be uninformed on communica- tion procedure is no excuse for you . Even if the exec puts a hand on that light you 're supposed to kick him the hell across the bridge away from it . That happens again , you 're out ten liberties . Get on the ball ! " He stalked off into the wheelhouse . Engstrand glanced reproachfully at Willie and walked to the other side of the bridge . Willie stared out to sea , his face burning . " The boor , the big stupid egotistic boor , " he thought . " Looking for any excuse to throw his weight around . Picking on the signalman to humiliate me more . The sadist , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock the minesweepers formed a slanting line , a thousand yards apart , and began to launch their sweep gear . Willie went to the fantail to watch . He could make no sense of the activity . The equipment was a foul tangle of greasy cables , shackles , floats , lines , and chains . Half a dozen deck hands stripped to the waist swarmed about under the eye of Maryk , uttering hoarse cries and warnings larded with horrible obscenitiesas they wrestled the junk here and there on the heaving fantail . Waves broke over their ankles when the ship rolled , and water sloshed around the gear . To Willie 's eye it was a scene of confusion and panic . He surmised that the Caine crew were unfitted for their jobs , and were fulfilling the ancient adage : When in danger or in doubt , Run in circles , scream and shout . After twenty minutes of this bawling and brawling , the boatswain 's mate in charge of the war dance , a chunky , frog-voiced , frantic chief named Bellison , shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie , perched clear of the water on an immense steam windlass , expressed to himself a strong doubt that anything was really " set " in that heap of scrap metal . " Keith , " yelled Maryk , " get clear of that windlass . " Willie jumped into an arriving wave , soaking his trousers halfway to the knees ; waded to the after-deckhouse ladder , and climbed up to see what would happen . The sailors cranked an egg-shaped paravane up on a crane . At a word from Maryk , they dumped all the gear over the side . Came clanks , rattles , splashes , yells , puffing of steam , creakingI00 IOIturns of the windlass , and a frenzy of running around , and a great cadenza of obscenity . Then sudden quiet ensued . The paravane was streaming neatly outward to starboard in a fanning arc , sinking slowly beneath the surface with a red float above it to mark the place . The serried cutting cable payed out from the windlass evenly . All was correctand orderly as a diagram in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear of the port paravane . Willie was no longer sure whether the faultless first launching had been a matter of luck or skill . When the turmoil and blasphemy reached their height as before he was inclined to attribute it to luck . But splash , grind , yowls , curses , silence  --  and the second paravane was streaming as neatly as the first . " I 'll be damned , " he said aloud . " Why ? " Willie jumped a little at the voice . Captain de Vriess was leaning over the bulwark beside him , watching the operation . " Well , sir , it looked pretty sharp to me , that 's all . " " That was the lousiest launching I 've ever seen , " said De Vriess . " Hey , Steve , what in the Christ took you forty-five minutes ? " Maryk smiled up at him . " Hello , Captain . Why , I did n't think the boys did too bad , for a four-month layoff . Look , sir , none of the other ships have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those snafu buckets ? We streamed at Noumea in thirty-eight . " " Sir , that was after four days ' practice --  " " Well , I want it done in thirty tomorrow . " " Yes , sir . " The dirty , sweating , ragged sailors stood around , hands resting on their belts , looking singularly self-satisfied under the captain 's criticism . " Sir , it was my fault , " spoke up the boatswain 's mate . He began an alibi which sounded to Willie like this : " The port bandersnatch got fouled in the starboard rath when we tried to galumph the cutting cable so as not to trip the snozzle again . I had to unshackle the doppelgangerand bend on two snarks instead so we could launch in a hurry . " " Well , " said De Vriess , " could n't you have vorpaled the sillabub or taken a turn on the chortlewort ? That way the jaxo would be clear of the varse and you could forget about the dudelsak . It would have done the same thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That might work okay . I 'll try it tomorrow . " Willie 's heart sank . He was certain that if he sailed a hundred years on the Caine he would understand such abracadabra no better than he did at that moment . " Sir , " he said to the captain , " is there a standard time for launching the gear ? " " Book calls for one hour , " said De Vriess . " The standard on this shipis thirty minutes . I 've never been able to make these stumblebums do it . Maybe your friend Queeg will have better luck . " " That 's a curious use of the word standard , ' sir , " ventured Willie . De Vriess gave him a satiric look . " Well , that 's Navy jargon for you  --  All right , " he called down , " you of the minesweep detail . All things considered it was n't too terrible a job . " " Thank you , sir , " said the sailors , grinning at each other . The other minesweepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began . Willie was dizzied by the turns and twists and changing formations . He tried hard to follow what was happening . Once he went to the bridge and asked Carmody , the junior officer of the deck , to explain the proceedings . Carmody answered with extendedgibberish about Baker Runs , George Runs , and Zebra Runs . Willie gathered at last by using his eyes that the ships were pretending to be in a mine field and simulating various emergencies and disasters . A lugubrious business , he thought . The sun was low and the clouds were reddening when word came over the p.a. , " Cease present exercises . Recover sweep gear . " Willie at once returned to the after deckhouse , partly to learn what he could about hauling in paravanes , but mainly to enjoy the cursing of the sailors . He had never heard anything like it . There was a fine dithyrambic sweep to Caine obscenity in hot moments . He was n't disappointed . The minesweep detail worked in a fever , racing against time to get the two paravanes aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging on the yardarms of the other ships ; the drop of a ball would mean that a paravane had been recovered . In fifteen minutes the Caine dropped its ball on the port yardarm ; and they had the starboard paravane in sight before the Moulton hauled down a ball . Lieutenant Maryk worked with the sailors , stripped to the waist , pouring sweat . " Come on , " he shouted , " twenty-eight minutes so far ! Best yet ! Let 's get that damned egg aboard . " But at the last moment there was a calamity . The sailor Fuller , who was pulling the little red float out of the water , juggled it and dropped it . The float bobbed away in the ship 's wake , free . The other sailors gathered around Fuller and discharged such a flood of inspired cursing that Willie wanted to applaud . Maryk sent word to the bridge . The Caine stopped and then backed slowly . Maryk tore off all his clothes and wrapped a line around his waist . " No sense foolingaround with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell the captain to stop the screws , " he said to the chief , and dived over the side . The sun had set . The float was a red dot on the purple waves , about two hundred yards off the port quarter . The sailors lined the rail , watching the first lieutenant 's head slowly approach the float , andIO2 103Willie heard them muttering about sharks . " I saw a goddamn hammerheadfive minutes ago , " Bellison said . " I 'm damned if I 'd swim for it . Save five minutes for the old man and get my behind snatched off --  " Somebody was tapping Willie on the shoulder . He turned impatiently . " Yes , yes , what is it ? " A radioman stood behind him with a flapping despatch in his hand . " This just came over Fox , sir . We 're the action addressee . Mr. Keefer says you got the coding duty  --  " Willie took the message and glanced at it . " Okay , okay . I 'll break it in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked to sea . Maryk 's head was barely visible now on the dark water . He had reached the float . He thrashed around in it for a minute or so , kicking up white foam , then leaped half out of the water and waved his arms . His shout came feebly on the wind , " Okay , haul in ! " The sailors began to pull the wet line back aboard frantically . The float came cutting through the water with Maryk clinging to it . Willie , tingling with excitement , scampered down the ladder to the fantail . He lost his footing on the slippery deck and fell . A wave of warm salty water broke over him , drenching him . He got himself up , spitting water , and grabbed a life line . The dripping float clanked on the deck . " Haul down the ball to starboard ! " Bellison yelled . A dozen arms reached for Maryk as his head bobbed up near the propeller guard . He clambered aboard . " Christ , sir , you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped . " What was the time of recovery ? " The telephone talker said , " Forty-one , sir , when the float got aboard . " " Beat ' em all , sir , " said a sailor , pointing seaward . Black balls still hung at the yardarms of the other ships . " That 's fine , " grinned Maryk . " Never have heard the end of it if one of those buckets beat us . " His eye fell on the bedraggled figure of Willie . " What the hell happened to you , Keith ? Did you dive in , too ? " The sailors noticed Willie now and snickered . " Got too interested watching you , " said Willie . " That was great work . " Maryk swept water from his broad brown chest and shoulders with his palms . " Hell , I 've been looking for an excuse to take a dip . " " Were n't you worried about sharks ? " " Sharks do n't bother you if you keep moving . Hell , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day rather than the old man if Iron Duke Sammis beat him recovering sweep gear  --  Come on , Keith , you and me need new clothes . " Willie dumped his sodden khakis in a heap in a corner of the clippingshack . He had completely forgotten the despatch in his pocket . There it lay , dissolving to a pulp inside the crumpled khakis , while the ship steamed through maneuvers for the next two days . The weather was good , and with the novelty of the different minesweepinggadgets , electric , moored , and acoustic , for entertainment , Willie found himself enjoying the trip as an amused spectator . In his watches on the bridge he got on a little better with Captain de Vriess by making a mighty effort to please . Taking as his rule Tom Keefer 's dictum , " How would I do this if I were a fool ? " he play-acted a **27;6671;TOOLONG ensign . He stood erect for the whole four hours , peering to sea . He never spoke , except when spoken to , or to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed absurd to mention it  --  a floating log , a tin can , a spread of garbage dumped from a ship  --  he gravely announced it ; and the captain invariably thanked him in pleased tones . The more he slipped into character as a plodding dolt , the better De Vriess seemed to like him . On the third day the formation moved in to shallow waters near a beach and swept some dummy mines . Not till Willie saw the yellowpaintedhorned iron balls bobbing on the foamy blue waves did he truly realize that the fantastic rig of cables and paravanes was good for anything but races against time between the captains of minesweepers . He took a strong interest in this part of the show . Once the Caine narrowly missed a mine cut by the Moulton . Willie pictured what might have happened had the mine been a live one , and began to wonder whether he ought to wait six months before applying to the admiral for rescue . The last sweep was completed two hours before sunset . There remained a chance that the ships could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night , by running for home at twenty knots . Unluckily the Moulton , which had the squadron commanderaboard , lost a paravane in the last moments of recovery , and fished for it for an hour while the other vessels waited and the crews fretted . When the Moulton grappled its paravane at last the sun was setting . The four old sweepers had to steam all night outside the channel entrance in futile circles . When they went in next morning , the Caine and Moulton were paired in one buoy berth . As soon as the gangplank was laid between the ships Willie got Gorton 's permission to cross over and visit Keggs . He was startled by the difference between the two ships the moment he set foot on the other quarterdeck . In structure they were identical . It was hardly conceivable that they could look so unlike . There was no rust here , no splashes of green prime coats . The bulwarks and decks were a clean uniform gray . The cording on ladder railings was newwhite . The leather wrappings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich brown , where those of the Caine were frayed , hung loose , and were covered with cracked gray paint . The dungarees of the sailors were clean , and the shirts tucked inside the trousers , whereas a flapping shirttail would have been a proper heraldic device for the Caine . Willie saw that it was not necessary for a DMS to look like his ship ; it was only necessary for the outcast Caine to look like what it was . " Keggs ? Sure , he 's in the wardroom , " said the OOD , neat as an admiral 's aide . Willie found Keggs at the green-covered table , drinking coffee with one hand and working a coding device with the other . " Hello , Keggsy boy ! Knock off for a minute , for Pete 's sake  --  " " Willie ! " The cup clattered to the saucer . Keggs jumped up and grabbed Willie 's outstretched hand with both his own . Willie thought the other 's hands were trembling . He was disturbed by his friend 's appearance . Thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bones protruded from his cheeks and the pallid skin seemed to stretch with difficulty the long distance to his jaw . There were a few strands of gray in his hair which Willie had never noticed before . His eyes were ringed in blue shadow . " Well , Ed , stuck you in communications , too , did they ? " " I relieved the communication officer last week , Willie . I 've been his assistant for five months --  " " Department head already , eh ? Nice going . " " Do n't make jokes , " said Keggs haggardly . Willie accepted coffee and sat . After they chatted awhile he said , " Have you got the duty tonight ? " Keggs pondered foggily . " No  --  not tonight --  " " Great . Maybe Roland has n't shoved off yet . We 'll hit the beach and hunt him up  --  " " Sorry , Willie . I 'd love to , but I ca n't . " " Why not ? " Keggs looked over his shoulder . There were no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The paravane . " " The one you lost ? What about it ? You recovered it . " " The whole ship is restricted for a week . " " The whole ship ? Officers , too ? " Keggs nodded . " Everybody . " " Why , in God 's name ? Who was responsible for losing it ? " " Everybody is responsible for everything on this ship , Willie  --  it 's the way --  " Keggs suddenly stiffened , sprang to his feet , and swept the coding device off the table . " Oh , God , " he said . Willie saw or heard no reason for the act except a muffled door slam overhead . " Excuse me , Willie --  " Keggs frantically stowed the code machine Io6in a safe , locked it , and seized a clipboard of decoded despatches hanging on a hook in the bulkhead . He stared at the wardroom door , gulping . Willie rose and stared , too , an uneasy fear possessing him despite himself . The door opened and a straight thin man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth like a puckered scar , stepped in . " Captain Sammis , this  --  this  --  is an acquaintance of mine , sir , from the Caine , sir , Ensign Keith . " " Keith , " said Sammis tonelessly , extending his hand . " My name is Sammis . " Willie touched the cold hand , and it withdrew . Captain Sammis sat in the chair Keggs had been using . " Coffee , sir ? " quavered Keggs . " Thank you , Keggs . " " This morning 's traffic is ready , sir , if you wish to look at it . " The captain nodded . Keggs scrambled to pour the coffee , then he drew despatches from the board and presented them for the Iron Duke 's view one by one , bowing slightly each time , and murmuring a comment . Sammis inspected each despatch and handed it back to Keggs without speaking . It was a picture of flunky and master such as Willie had never seen outside of costume movies . " I do n't see number 367 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that down when my friend came . It 's three quarters finished . I can complete it in two minutes , sir  --  right now if you desire --  " " What precedence is it ? " " Deferred , sir . " Sammis cast a bleak look at Willie , showing awareness of his presence for the first and last time after the handshake . " You may wait , " he said , " until your visitor has gone . " " Thank you very much , sir . " Iron Duke Sammis sipped the rest of his coffee at leisure , looking neither left nor right , while Keggs stood at his elbow in respectful silence , clutching the despatch board . Willie leaned against the bulkhead , marveling . The captain patted his mouth with a handkerchief , lit a cigarette with a flick of a gold-plated lighter , rose , and walked out . " Banzai , " murmured Willie , as the door closed . " Sh ! " Keggs shot him an imploring look and fell into a chair . After a few moments he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Willie put his arm compassionately around Keggs 's bowed shoulders . " Ye gods , man , how did you ever let him get you so buffaloed ? " Keggs looked at him in mournful surprise . " Is n't your skipper like that ? " I 07 " Hell , no . I mean , he 's a low brute in his own way , but  --  good God , this one is comical  --  " " Take it easy , Willie , " Keggs begged , glancing over his shoulder again . " Why , I imagined all captains were pretty much the same --  " " You 're crazy , boy . Have n't you been on any other ship ? " Keggs shook his head . " I picked up the Moulton at Guadalcanal and we 've been operating ever since . I have n't even been ashore in Pearl yet " " The captain does n't live , " said Willie through his teeth , " who can make me do monkey tricks like that . " " He 's a pretty good skipper , Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to understand Hitler , for that matter , " said Willie . " I 'll come over to your ship , Willie , as soon as I can . Maybe later today . " Keggs took the coding device out of the safe with unconcealed anxiety to get to work . Willie left him . On the rusty littered quarterdeck of the Caine , by the OOD 's desk , stood a strange figure : a marine corporal in faultless dress uniform , straight as a tin soldier , his buttons glittering in the sun . " Here 's Ensign Keith now , " said the OOD , Carmody , to the marine . The stiff figure strode up to Willie and saluted . " With the compliments of Rear AdmiralReynolds , sir , " he said , presenting Willie with a sealed envelope . Willie opened it and read a typewritten note : Ensign Willis Keith is cordially invited to a reception for Rear Admiral Clough at the home of Rear Admiral Reynolds tonight at 2000 . Transportation will be furnished by ComCarDiv Twenty barge which will arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by direction . " Thank you , " said Willie . The marine saluted rigidly again , went through all the forms of leaving the quarterdeck with the jerkiness of an animated doll , and climbed down the chain ladder outboard to a sleek admiral 's barge with a white-fringed canopy . Carmody dismissed the boatswain , and the barge purred away . " My God , " said the little Annapolis man , pulling at his mustache and regarding Willie with awe , " what kind of drag do you have ? " " Keep it quiet , " said Willie jauntily . " I am Franklin D. Roosevelt , Jr. , traveling incognito . " He strolled off to the forecastle , the mystified stare of Carmody warming him like champagne . Willie walked to the stem , where a cool breeze fluttered the blue starry jack . He sat on the deck , leaning against the jackstaff , and gave himself up to thorny analysis of recent scenes . What he had observed Io8aboard the Moulton confused all his ideas about his own ship . In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but compared to Iron Duke Sammis his captain was lazily benevolent . Then , the Moulton was a model of naval order and efficiency , the Caine a wretched Chinese junk by comparison . Yet the smart ship had dropped a paravane ; the rusty tramp had led all the ships in minesweeping performance . How did these facts fit together ? Was the loss of the paravane a meaningless accident ? Was the Caine 's working skill another accident , owing to the presence of the fisherman Maryk ? In the hybrid world of destroyerminesweepersall rules seemed to be confounded . The words of Tom Keefer came back to him : " The Navy is a master plan designed by geniuses for execution by idiots , " and " Ask yourself , How would I do this if I were a fool ? ' " He respected the communicator 's mind ; he had heard Maryk acknowledge its keenness . These maxims must guide him , he decided , until he could piece together his own views and make --  " Ensign Keith , report to the captain 's cabin on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing him to his feet . As he ran to the wardroom he rapidly reviewed possible reasons for the summons , and guessed that perhaps Carmody had told the captain about the admiral 's barge . He knocked gaily at the captain 's door . " Come in , Keith . " De Vriess , in trousers and undershirt , sat at his desk , glowering at a long list of despatch headings , one of which was circled in heavy red crayon . Beside him stood Tom Keefer and the radioman who had brought Willie the forgotten message three days ago . The radioman twisted his white cap in his hands and gave the ensign a frightened look . Keefer shook his head at Willie . The sight told Willie all . He experienced a longing to vanish or die . " Willie , " said the captain in a level , not unkind tone , " three days ago this ship received a despatch addressed to us for action . I learned this interesting fact for the first time five minutes ago while making a routine check of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I always do that when we come into port . These dull habits sometimes pay off . Now , the radio shack has orders to shoot action despatchesto the coding officer the instant they come in . Snuffy Smith here claims he gave the message to you three days ago . Is he lying ? " The radioman blurted , " Sir , I gave it to you on the after deckhouse while they were recovering paravanes . You remember ! " " You did , Smith , " said Willie . " I 'm sorry , Captain . It 's my fault . " " I see . Have you decoded the message ? " " No , sir . I 'm sorry , but it --  " " Very well . Smith , lay up to the radio shack and bring Lieutenant Keefer the Fox sked on the double . " I09 " Aye aye , sir . " The sailor darted out of the cabin . The " Fox skeds " were the log sheets on which all despatches sent to Navy ships at sea were copied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then destroyed . Despatches concerning the ship were recopied on separate forms . It was such a retyped form that lay moldering in Willie 's khakis in the clip shack . " The next thing , Tom , " said the captain calmly , " is to break that message faster than you 've ever done anything in your life . " " I will , sir . I really think there 's no great cause for concern . It 's routine precedence . Maybe a BuShips modification or  --  " " Well , let 's see , shall we ? " " Yes , sir . " As the communicator walked out he said in low tones of reproach , " Good God , Willie . " Captain de Vriess paced the narrow cabin , taking no notice of Willie . Except that he puffed his cigarette faster than usual , he gave no sign of being disturbed . In a few moments the coding machine began clicking in the wardroom . The captain went out , leaving the door open , and peered over Keefer 's shoulder as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . De Vriess took the completed decode from Keefer 's hands and scanned it . " Thank you , Tom . " He came into his cabin , closing the door . " Too bad you did n't break it when it came , Mister Keith . It might have interestedyou . Read it . " He handed the breakdown to Willie . Lieutenant Commander WilliamH. de Vriess USN detached when relieved . Report to BuPers by air transportation for further assignment . Class two priority authorized . Training duty of Lieutenant Commander Philip F. Queeg has been canceled and he is proceeding to relieve at once . Willie returned the despatch to the captain . " I 'm sorry , sir . It 's incrediblestupidity and carelessness on my part , " he said , choking over the words . " I do n't know what else to say , sir , except  --  " " What happened to the despatch Smith gave you ? " " It 's still in the pocket of some dirty khakis . Smith handed me the despatch while Mr. Maryk was swimming for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I guess I became interested in the float recovery and forgot all about it . . . . " The words sounded so lame to his own ears that he blushed . De Vriess leaned his head on his hand for a moment . " Have you any idea , Keith , how serious the mislaying of an action despatch can be ? " " Yes , sir . " " I 'm not sure you have , " The captain ran his hands through his hanging blond hair . " Conceivably this ship might have failed to carry out a combat assignment  --  with all that that entails . I hope you realizethat for such failure I would have borne sole responsibility at the court-martial . " " I know , sir . " " Well , how does that fact register on you ? " " With a determination never to let it happen again . " " I wonder . " The captain picked up a stack of long yellow forms on his desk . " By a coincidence which is perhaps unlucky , I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , together with those of the other officers . I have to submit them to the Bureau when I 'm detached . " A tremor and tingle of alarm passed through the e.nsign . " How do you suppose this incident ought to affect your fitness report ? " " It 's not for me to say , sir . Anybody can make one mistake --  " " There are mistakes and mistakes . The margin for error is narrow in the Navy , Willie . There 's too much life and property and danger involved in every act . You 're in the Navy now . " " I realize that , sir . " " Frankly , I do n't think you do . What just happened calls for me to give you an unsatisfactory fitness report . It 's an unpleasant , dirty thing to do . These sheets lie in the Bureau forever . Everything written on them becomes part of your name . I do n't like to wreck a man 's naval career , even when he regards it lightly . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad mistake and I 'm desperatelysorry . I 've made that as clear as words can make it . " " Maybe now is the time to clean up your report , " said the captain . He pulled out one of the forms from the batch , picked up a pencil , and started to write . " May I say one thing more , sir ? " Willie put in quickly . " Certainly . " The captain looked up , pencil poised . " You 're writing that report with this incident pretty fresh in your mind . It 's bad enough , I know . But I wonder whether twenty-four hours from now your phrasing might not be a little fairer  --  " De Vriess smiled in the familiar sarcastic way . " A good point . But I 'll look over all the sheets tomorrow anyway before giving them to the yeoman . Perhaps I 'll be feeling more charitable then , in which case 1 ' 11 make the necessary changes . " " I 'm not asking for charity , sir . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unexpectedly neat small hand . He gave the report to Willie . Underneath General Remarks he had written this : Ensign Keith seems a bright and apt young man . He has been aboard less than two weeks . He shows promise of becoming a coin-IIO IIIpetent officer . But he must first overcome a somewhat light and careless approach to his duties . Above this there was a space in which was printed , I consider this officer : Outstanding  --  Excellent  --  Above Average  --  Average  --  Unsatisf actory . De Vriess had erased a check beside Excellent and moved it to Above Average . This was , in Navy usage , a blackball . The fitness report was so dread an instrument that few commanding officers had the bowels to be coldly honest . As a result the average officer was judged " Excellent " on these forms . To call a man " Above Average " was to inform the Bureau that he was a nonentity . Willie knew all this . He had typed dozens of the reports at CincPac . He read the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint praise , skillful and malicious , beyond hope of repair . He returned the sheet to the captain , trying to keep his face blank of emotion . " Is that all , sir ? " " Do you consider that summary unfair ? " " I 'd rather not comment , sir . The fitness report is your province  --  " " My duty to the Bureau requires as honest an opinion as I can give . That report is by no means unsatisfactory , you know . You can erase it with one good one . " " Thank you very much , sir . " Willie was trembling with suppressed irritation . He wanted nothing but to leave the cabin at once . He felt De Vriess was detaining him merely to gloat over him . " May I go , sir ? " De Vriess looked at him , his expression mingling wry sadness with his habitual mockery . " It 's my duty to inform you that if you feel the report is unjust you have the right to attach a letter challenging it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " " All right , Willie . Do n't mislay any more action despatches . " " Aye aye , sir . " Willie turned and put his hand on the doorknob . " One moment , please . " " Yes , sir ? " The captain tossed the fitness report on his desk and swiveled his chair back and forth slowly . " I think there 's a matter of disciplinary action to be considered . " Willie threw a bitter look from the captain to the yellow form . " The report , at least to my limited mind , does n't come under that heading , " observed De Vriess . " The punitive use of the fitness report negates the value of the system and is strictly forbidden by a SecNav directive . " " That 's good to know , sir . " Willie considered that a bold ironic thrust , but it made no dent on De Vriess. 1 I2 " I 'm putting you in hack for three days , Willie  --  the same length of time you held up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head . " " I 'm sorry to be ignorant , sir . Exactly what does that involve for me ? " " Confinement to your room except for meals and calls of nature  --  On second thought , " added the captain , " confinement to the clip shack would be cruel and unusual punishment , no doubt of that . Let 's say you 're confined to the limits of the ship for three days . " " Aye aye , sir . " " Well , I guess that 's all . " As Willie turned to go , a thought penetrated his red haze of anger . He pulled the admiral 's invitation from his pocket and silently handed it to De Vriess . The captain pursed his lips . " Well , well . Admiral Reynolds , hey ? Pretty good company . How do you know the admiral ? " " I happened to meet him socially , sir . " " Why does he want you at this particular shindig ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I play the piano a bit . The admiral seems to enjoy it . " " You do ? I did n't know that . I play a sax myself , a little bit , when I 'm home . You must be pretty good to get requisitioned by the admiral . Like to hear you play sometime . " " Delighted to oblige , sir , any time at your convenience . " De Vriess regarded the invitation , smiling . " Tonight , hey ? Well , far be it from me to dampen the admiral 's party . Let 's say your confinement begins at o800 tomorrow . How 's that ? " " Whatever you say , sir . I do n't want any special treatment . " " Well , we 'll leave it at that . Have a good time tonight . Do n't drown your sorrows too heavily . " " Thank you , Captain . Is that all ? " " That 's all , Willie . " He returned the invitation to the ensign , who turned and walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladder and ran to the clipping shack . His course was clear to him now . His position on the Caine was hopeless . The new captain would read the fitness report and mark him once for all as an unreliable fool  --  not a fool in Keefer 's sense , but in the Navy sense . There was only one thing to do : get off this cursed ship and make a fresh start . The penalty for his mistake was paid in the damning fitness report . " I can , and I will , erase that description from my record , so help me God , " he swore to himself . " But not on the Caine . Not on the Caine ! " He was sure that the admiral would get him transferred . Several times the great man had embraced him after a chorus of Who Hit Annie in the Fanny with a Flounder , and had declared that he would do almost anything to get Willie on his staff permanently . " JustI13say the word , Willie ! " He had been joking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , Willie knew . He dragged the qualification course from a grimy drawer in the clippingshack . He calculated the number of lessons due by this date . He spent the rest of the morning and the whole afternoon grimly filling out those assignments . After dinner he presented himself in Lieutenant Adams ' room , shaved , glossy , and dressed in his last precious set of shorelaunderedkhakis . " Request permission to leave the ship , sir . " Adams glanced at him sympathetically . His eye moved to the four assignments in Willie 's hand , and he smiled . " Granted . Give my love to the admiral . " He took the assignments and laid them in his workbasket . As Willie mounted the ladder to the main deck he met Paynter coming down with both fists full of wrinkled , moldy letters . He said , " Anything for me ? " " I dropped yours in the clip shack . This is all old stuff that chased us around SoPac for a couple of months . Just caught up with us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly on the quarterdeck in the twilight as he shouted names and passed out letters and packages . Four dirty weather-stained canvas sacks of mail were heaped on the deck at his feet . Harding was lying on his bunk in the gloomy clipping shack . " Nothing for me , " he said sleepily . " I was n't on the Caine mailing list way back then . You sure were . " " Yes , my folks thought I was going straight to the Caine  --  " Willie snapped on the dim light . There were several old crumpled letters from May and his mother , and a few others ; also a battered oblong package that looked like a book . His nerves were shocked when he saw his father 's handwriting on the package . He tore it open , and found a blackboundBible with a wrinkled note protruding from it . Here 's the Bible I promised you , Willie . Luckily I found one right here in the hospital bookstore , otherwise I 'd have had to send out for it . I guess Bibles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cramped it 's because I 'm sitting up in bed to write this . Everything 's proceeding on schedule , I 'm afraid . They 're operatingtomorrow . The surgeon is old Dr. Nostrand , who should know better than to try to kid me . But I appreciate his optimism only too eagerly , all the same . Well , my son , take a look at Ecclesiastes 9:1o , will you ? I 'll let that stand as my last word to you . Nothing more now , but good-by , and God bless you . DADWillie turned to the Bible passage with shaking hands . Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do , do it with thy might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in the grave , whither thou goest . The words were underlined with wavering ink lines . Beside them Dr. Keith had written in the broad margin : " He 's talking about your job on the Caine , Willie . Good luck . " Willie turned out the light , threw himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow . He lay so , motionless , for a long while , heedless of the creasing of his last shore-laundered khakis . Someone reached in and touched his arm . " Ensign Keith ? " He looked up . The admiral 's marine orderly stood just outside the shack . " Pardon me , sir . The barge is at the gangway for you . " " Thank you , " said Willie . He raised up on an elbow , covering his eyes with his hand . " Look , will you please tell the admiral I 'm terribly sorry , but I ca n't come tonight ? It seems I have the duty . " " Yes , sir , " said the marine in a wondering tone , and departed . Willie dropped his face into the pillow again . The next morning , Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg reported aboard the Caine. 114 115III . CAPTAIN QUEEG11 CAPTAIN QUEEG RELIEVES CAPTAIN DE VRIESSLanguishing in hack , Willie missed the important moment when CaptainQueeg first set foot on the deck of the Caine . Willie was taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vriess had given him the run of the ship , but he was determined not to stir from the clipping shack except for bodily needs . When Queeg arrived Willie was hunched on his bunk over the remains of a frigid , dirty breakfast , mopping up the last yellow traces of egg with a piece of stale bread . He was proud of his penance . The meal , brought by the leisurely Whittaker through passageways , up ladders , and along the main deck , had lost all heat and acquired a heavy dressing of soot on the way . It seemed to Willie that adversity was toughening him rapidly ; he felt virile and mature . This was a great deal of spiritual uplift to derive from a couple of cold black eggs , but Willie 's young spirit had a lot of rebound to it , like fresh rubber . Also , Whittaker had picked up coffee for the prisoner from the crew 's galley near the clip shack , strong and steaming . Willie was partly mistaking the glow of morning coffee for the maturing process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a routine morning trip to the fleet landing for mail and a movie . The ragged boatswain and his two filthy assistants were appalled when Queeg accosted them and courteously ordered them to load his foot locker and bags into the boat . They had no way of warning the officer of the deck about their passenger , and so the new captain caught his first impression of the ship in its natural unpolished state . The officer of the deck was Ensign Harding , entrusted with the gangway watch from four to eight only because Lieutenant Adams was reasonably certain that nothing complicated was going to happen inI18those early hours . He was dressed in wrinkled , sweaty khakis , and it was his misfortune to have no hips at all , so that his frayed gun belt sagged slantwise , precariously supported by his rump . His cap was pushed back to allow the breeze to fan his pale bald brow . He was leaningagainst the gangway desk , happily eating an apple , when blue sleeves with two and a half gold stripes rose along the ladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander Queeg . Harding was not alarmed . Officers of such rank often came aboard ; usually they were engineering specialists coming to the rescue of some vital machinery on the decaying Caine . He put down the apple , spitting out a seed , and walked to the ladder . Commander Queeg saluted the colors , and then saluted Harding . " Request permission to come aboard , sir , " he said politely . " Permission granted . " Harding gave a bare flip of a salute , Cainestyle . The new captain smiled slightly and said , " My name is Queeg . " He held out his hand . Harding stiffened , gulped , pulled up his belt , saluted again , and tried to return the handshake , but Queeg had put his hand up to return the salute , so that Harding grasped empty air . Then the handclasp was fumblingly accomplished , and Harding babbled , " I 'm sorry , Captain  --  I did n't recognize you -- - " " No reason you should . You 've never seen me before . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't expecting you , Captain  --  would you like me to show you to the captain 's cabin ? I 'm not sure the captain is up yet --  " He whirled on the gangway petty officer , who was staring at Queeg as though trying to see into his soul . " Go tell the captain the new captain is here --  " " Yes , sir . " The petty officer , Winston , a stout ambitious boatswain 's mate second class , saluted Harding , then turned to the lieutenant commanderand gave him a dazzling training-camp salute . " Welcome aboard , Captain . " He dashed up the starboard passageway . Harding cast a despairing look around the quarterdeck , and decided that it was hopeless to try to change the new captain 's first impression of the Caine . Supposing , thought the OOD , he did chase away the two half-naked sailors who squatted at a tin tub , peeling potatoes ; and called a halt to the din of the metal scrapers ; and ordered the gangway messenger to pick up the tattered comic books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two deck hands who were supposed to be repairing a life raft , but were actually about to come to blows over some moldy chocolate they had found on the raft ; what then ? There remained the stinking cabbage crates , and the pile of officers ' laundry , I19and the helmets with new names painted on them in red , drying in the sun , and the dirty nest of life jackets on which some sailor had slept , and the oozing black puddle of galley fuel oil which a cook had slopped on the deck . The Caine had been caught in its soiled underwear , and that was that . The world would have to wag on , somehow . " Did you have a good trip , sir ? " " Middling good , thank you . Flew down from San Francisco . A little bumpy . " Queeg 's voice and manner were pleasant . He gave no sign of being disturbed at the dishevelment of the Caine , or even of being aware of it . " My name is Harding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Assistant first lieutenant . " " Been aboard long , Harding ? " " Just about three weeks , sir . " " I see . " The new captain turned and watched the gig crew struggling up the ladder with his gear . " What 's the name of that coxswain ? " Harding knew him only as Meatball . " One moment , sir . " He dashed to the desk , peered at the watch list , and returned , feeling extremely foolish . " Dlugatch , sir . " " New man ? " " No , sir . I  --  that is , in general they refer to him as Meatball . " " I see . " Queeg leaned over the railing . " Dlugatch , go easy with that pigskin bag . " " Aye aye , sir , " came the grunt of the coxswain . " I think , " said the new captain to Harding , " that you may as well stack my gear here until I talk to Captain de Vriess . " " Aye aye , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil slick , " said Queeg with a smile . " Yes , sir , " said Harding , quailing a little . Winston reappeared . He had managed during his errand to brighten his shoes and snatch a clean white cap from somebody . The cap was squared on his head with just the right forward tilt . He saluted the officer of the deck smartly . " Captain de Vriess coming now , sir . " " Very well . " Harding returned the unexpected salute , feeling like a hypocrite . De Vriess emerged from the passageway , greeted the new commanding officer , and shook hands affably . They made a neat picture of the old and the new : De Vriess tieless and comfortable in faded khakis , Queeg correct in stiff white collar and fresh campaign ribbons . " Had your breakfast ? " said De Vriess . " Yes , thank you . " " Would you like to come to my cabin ? " I20 " Fine . " " Let me lead the way  --  or do you know these Izoo-tonners ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bristol class . " They exchanged pleasant smiles , and De Vriess led his successor forward . When they were out of earshot Winston said to the officer of the deck . " Looks like a good Joe . " " For Christ 's sake , " said Harding , tightening his gun belt two notches , " let 's see what we can do about this quarterdeck . " The two commanding officers sat in De Vriess 's cabin , drinking coffee . Queeg leaned back comfortably in the low black leather armchair . De Vriess was in the swivel chair at his desk . " Kind of sudden , this whole deal , " said De Vriess . " Well , I did n't much like being yanked out of anti-submarine school , " said Queeg . " I 'd moved my wife and family down to San Diego and we were all set for six good weeks , anyway . First shore billet I 'd had in four years . " " I 'm sorry for your wife . " " Well , she 's a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After a moment of silent sipping De Vriess said , " You 're class of ' 34 ? " " Thirty-six , " said Queeg . De Vriess knew this . He also knew Queeg 's precedence number , his class standing , and several other facts about him . But it was a nice point of etiquette to simulate ignorance . It was a courtesy , too , to place Queeg by mistake in an earlier class ; it implied that Queeg was obtaining a command for which he was rather young . " They 're moving you fellows up now pretty fast . " " I guess they want you somewhere in pretty much of a hurry , too . New construction , I suppose ? " " I do n't know . I hope they give me a supply depot in the middle of Utah . Some place with no water . " " Not much chance of that . " " Guess not . " De Vriess gave a false sigh of despair . Both men were stepping gingerly around the point uppermost in both their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Queeg getting on , an obsoleteship . De Vriess said , " Had much to do with minesweeping ? " " Not a hell of a lot . Seems to me they might have sent me to Mine Warfare School . But I guess somebody in the Bureau had his pants on fire for some reason . " " Well , hell , you know as much as I did when I came aboard . Not a whole lot to it  --  More coffee ? " " No , thanks . " I2IDe Vriess took Queeg 's cup and set it on the desk . Queeg reached into his pocket . De Vriess , expecting him to pull out cigarettes , picked up a packet of matches . But Queeg brought out a couple of bright steel ball bearings the size of marbles , and began rolling them absently between the thumb and fingers of his left hand . " I imagine , " said Queeg casually , " that it 's mainly a matter of towing rigs of one sort and another . " " That 's about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more casually . His question about minesweeping had not been random . In the back of his mind was the conjecture that Queeg was being groomed to commandthe squadron . But that possibility he now ruled out . He indicated a large battered blue book in the rack above his desk . " All the dope is in BuShips 270 , the Minesweeping Manual . You might take a look at it one of these days . " " I 've read it . Seems simple enough . " " Oh , it is . Pure routine . The boys back aft are pretty fair hands at it . And your first lieutenant , Maryk , is a crackerjack . You wo n't have any trouble . We just ran off a very satisfactory exercise last week . Sorry you were n't aboard . " " Maryk , " said Queeg . " Regular ? " " No . There are only two regulars beside yourself . The way they 're hauling those boys off to radar schools and what not , you 'll probably have a solid reserve wardroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many  --  twelve ? " " Ten  --  theoretically . The complement is eleven . We 've been down to seven and up again . There 'll be eleven now , counting yourself . " Queeg stopped rolling the steel halls , and began rattling them slowly in his fist . " Good bunch ? " " Not bad . Some good , some so-so . " " Made out their fitness reports ? " " Yes . " " Might I have a look-see ? " De Vriess hesitated . He would have preferred simply to talk about the officers , touching briefly on their defects and high-lighting their good points . He cast about for a diplomatic way to refuse the request , but none occurred to him . He pulled open his desk drawer . " If you want to , " he said , and passed the bundle of long white sheets to his successor . Queeg glanced at the first three in silence , rolling the balls ceaselessly between his fingers . " Pretty nice . This about Maryk , especially . For a reserve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a fisherman . He knows more about seamanship than some chief boatswain 's mates . " I22 " Fine . " Queeg read on . He flipped quickly through the sheets , ignoringthe elaborate mathematical scores , glancing at De Vriess 's generalsummary of each officer 's character . De Vriess felt more and more strongly that he was abetting a kind of peeking . He was relieved when Queeg handed the reports back to him , saying , " Seems like a good wardroom , all in all . " " As good as you 'll find , I think . " " What 's the matter with this Keith ? " " Nothing . He 's going to be a good officer . Needed a kick in the pants , and I gave it to him . I do n't know but what I 'll rewrite that before I shoot it in . He 's willing and has a good head . " " Why did he need a kick in the pants ? " " Well , he mislaid a despatch . Not an important one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting started , you know  --  I thought he ought to be brought up short . " Queeg pursed his lips , then smiled agreeably . " I suppose no despatch is unimportant , really . " " Well , you 're right , there . " " Did your communications officer catch the mistake  --  this Keefer ? " " Keefer does very well . Of course no system is foolproof . He 's a strange duck , by the way . Brilliant mind . A writer . Read about all the books in the world . Son of a gun 's been working on a novel in off hours --  " " Did you discipline Keith ? " " Put him in hack for three days . " " How about Keefer ? " " I ought to make one thing as clear as I can , " said De Vriess in a firm , pleasant tone . " I regard both those men as excellent officer material . Keith may turn into an outstanding officer after some seasoning . As for Keefer , he has brains enough to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests are somewhat divided . You engage his loyalty and he 'll deliver the goods . Stands a fine OOD watch under way . " " Nice to know . How are we on watch-standers ? " The far-off thumping of metal scrapers was augmented by a new sound directly overhead , a terrific clatter and clanking of another party of paint chippers . Queeg winced . De Vriess leaped up , pressed a buzzer , and roared into a brass speaking tube at the head of his bed , " Engstrand ! Tell the damn deck force to stop trying to split my skull ! " The two men looked at each other in wry amusement for a few deafening seconds , and the noise suddenly subsided . " Lot of that going on , " observed Queeg. 123 " Every time we 're in port the deck boys turn to . Only way to stay ahead of the rust . " " I wonder why ? Scrape her down to fiat bright metal and give her a good double coat , and that ought to be the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any flat bright metal , " said De Vriess . " These decks have taken too much salt water . They 're pitted . The rust starts up from a pit and just spreads under the new paint like a skin disease . It 's not a bad thing . Chipping paint is good exercise . We 've killed a hell of a lot of dead time for the crew chipping paint . " " How does the ship handle ? " " Like any destroyer . All the power you need . She wo n't turn on a dime like these new destroyer-escorts . But you can maneuver her . " ' Wind take her much , coming alongside ? " " Well , you have to watch the wind . " " Good line-handling parties ? " " No kick there . Maryk has them trained up pretty fair . " " I like fast line handling . " " So do I. You 've handled destroyers ? " " Well , " said Queeg , " I guess I 've had a few million hours as OOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth ? " " Well , I 've seen it done often enough . Given the orders and so forth . " De Vriess regarded his successor narrowly . ' Were you exec on this Bristol-class destroyer ? " " Well , just a month or so . Had almost every other department  --  it was the Falk  --  guns , hull , black gang , communications  --  I was just breaking in as exec when they yanked me over to a carrier --  --  " " Skipper give you the conn much ? " ' Well , there was n't much chance . A few times . " De Vriess offered Queeg a cigarette and lit one himself . " If you like , " he said carelessly , waving out the match , " we can take her out for a couple of runs before you take over . I can stand by while you shoot a few approaches , and getting away from alongside , and maybe some power turns and so forth --  " " Thanks , that wo n't be necessary . " De Vriess puffed twice on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm at your service . How do you want to go about this ? " " Well , I 'll have to sight the registered publications and execute a transfer report , " said Queeg . " Guess maybe we can do that pretty soon , like today . And I 'd appreciate having a look around --  " " Let 's do that this morning . " " I suppose all the reports are up to date ? Let 's see  --  logs , war diary , hull , burn reports , personnel roster , and so forth ? " 124 " If they are n't they will be when you 're ready to relieve . " " How about the Title B inventory ? " De Vriess compressed his lips . " Well , I 'm sorry to say that 's pretty fouled up . I 'd be kidding you if I told you anything else . " " What 's the trouble ? " " The trouble is simply that this ship has steamed about a hundredthousand miles since the war started , " said De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip-ships and night actions and storms and what not that half our Title B gear is gone and we do n't know where the hell it 's gone to . When you lose a snatch block over the side in the middle of towing some silly bastard off a reef under air attack you just do n't make the entry on the Title B card . You ought to , but you do n't . " " Well , running off a fresh inventory and sending in a survey report on the lost gear would take care of that . " " Sure it would . A Title B inventory takes two weeks . If you want to wait around till we push one through , I 'll be happy to get it rolling --  " " Hell , no , I can attend to it as well as you , " said Queeg . " I thought maybe I 'd relieve tomorrow  --  if I could see the registered pubs and the reports today . " De Vriess was pleased and startled . He had relieved his own commanding officer on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had been fully as familiar with the ship as the captain . Queeg was stepping into a vessel of a new type , about which he knew almost nothing . He would have been justified in requesting several days at sea , in order to observe all the ship 's equipment in action . De Vriess had figured that the transfer of command might take a week . But it was absolutely outside naval manners to make any comment . He rose . " Good enough , " he said . " Pretty nice to think of seeing my wife in three days . How about a quick Cook 's tour of the ship ? " " Okay . " Queeg dropped the steel balls into his pocket . " If I 'd known you were coming , " said De Vriess , " I 'd have run off a captain 's inspection and shined her up for you a bit . The boys can do a good job , though you may not think so to look at her now . " " Pretty cool for Hawaii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keith lay on his bunk in the clipping shack that afternoon , trying without success to read Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason , which he had borrowed from Keefer . Curiosity gnawed at him ; he could hardly resist leaving his self-imposed jail to have a look at the man who had come to free him from the tyranny of De Vriess . He read the same page over four times , while his mind kept wandering to the task ofI25constructing Queeg from Harding 's description , as scientists construct cave men from a piece of a jawbone . " Mistuh Keith , suh ? " Willie looked up into the sad loose-lipped face of Whittaker , a couple of inches from his own . " Yes , Whittaker ? " " Cap'n want you in de wardroom . " Willie jumped to the deck and put on his cleanest khakis , stabbing the ball of his thumb in his hurry to change the collar pins . When he walked into the wardroom , therefore , he was sucking his thumb ; a perhaps unfortunate touch of immaturity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ensign Keith , " said De Vriess with sardonic formality , " Lieutenant Commander Queeg . " The new captain rose and greeted Willie with a firm handshake and a friendly smile . In one anxious glance Willie took in these details : a small man , slightly shorter than himself ; natty blues with two campaignribbons and one battle star ; an oval , somewhat plump fair face with small narrowed eyes ; and some strands of sandy hair across an almost bald head , with thicker fringes at the sides . " Hello , Mr. Keith , " said Queeg with cordial good humor , and a gay lift in the tones . Willie liked him at once . " How do you do , sir . " " Willie , " said De Vriess , " are you all set to run off a registered pubs inventory and a transfer report ? Commander Queeg wants ' em this afternoon . " " Certainly , sir . " " Not missing anything , are we ? " " No , sir . " Willie allowed himself a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be draining out of De Vriess . " Good . " The captain turned to his successor . " He 's all yours . If I can be of any further assistance , let me know . " De Vriess stepped into his cabin and closed the door . Willie turned to his new commanding officer . He could not repress a mischievous grin . " Nice to have you aboard , sir . " " Why , thank you , Willie , " said Queeg , with a lift of the eyebrows , and a warm smile . " Let 's get started , shall we ? " Next morning at eleven the crew lined up at quarters on the forecastle , and the ceremony of transferring command was enacted in a perfunctory way . The officers had tried very hard to make the crew look respectable for the occasion ; but despite the shoeshines and new dungarees and shaved faces the general effect was that of a group of tramps freshly deloused by the Salvation Army . After the ceremony the two commanding officers went below to-I26gether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both officers . De Vriess picked his way to the desk . He opened the small safe , took out several tagged keys and some sealed envelopes , and handed them to Queeg . " Envelopes are various safe combinations you 'll want to have . . . . Well , I think that 's it . " He glanced around the room . " I left you a stack of mysteries . I do n't know if you like ' em , but that 's all I can read . Distract me from whatever 's bothering me . Never remember what I 'm reading from one page to the next , any-way . " " Thanks . I guess I 'll have all I can do to keep up with official reading for a while . " " Sure enough . Well  --  I 'm off . " De Vriess cocked his head and looked his successor in the eye . Queeg met the glance for a moment , then offered his hand to De Vriess . " Best of luck with your new construction . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Queeg , and a good crew . " " I hope I 'm up to handling it . " De Vriess grinned , and said hesitantly , " I 'm wondering if you do n't think it 's a pretty sloppy lash-up . " " Oh , I quite understand , " said Queeg . " You 've been in a forward area a hell of a long time  --  " " It is n't that . You can do things with some ships that you ca n't do with others , " said De Vriess . " Between you and me , these damn buckets ought to be melted down to razor blades . They roll and pitch too damn much , the power plant is shot , all the machinery is obsolete , and the men are crowded like animals . These are the only firerooms left in the Navy where the black gang has to work under air pressure . If anything goes wrong a blowback can kill them all . The men know the kind of deal they 've got . The strange thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of them put in for transfers . But they have to do things their own way . It 's the hooligan navy , to look at them . But give them a chance , and they deliver . They 've backed me up in some bad spots  --  " " Well , thanks for the dope , " said Queeg . " Is the gig standing by for you ? " " I think so . " De Vriess ground out his cigar , and opened the door . " Whittaker ! How about bearing a hand with my gear ? " Willie was at the gangway , buckling on his gun belt , when two steward 's mates came up with the bags , followed by De Vriess . " Where 's the gig , Willie ? " " Oh . I did n't think you were shoving off till four , sir . I just sent it over to the Frobisher to trade movies . It 'll be back in ten minutes . Sorry , sir . " I27 " No harm done . Drop the bags here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steward 's mates . " Good-by , Captain . " " Do n't bring the new skipper any of that cold coffee up to the bridge . " " Nosuh . " The colored boys grinned . De Vriess put his foot up on a life line and stared out over the harbor . He looked strangely impressive in dress blues . Sailors chipping paint on the quarterdeck threw curious glances at him and exchanged low remarks . Willie , oppressed by a heavy gap of embarrassment between himself and his ex-captain , felt obliged to make conversation . " How does it feel , sir ? " " How does what feel ? " said De Vriess , not looking at him . " Well , leaving the ship after  --  how long  --  over five years , is n't it ? " De Vriess bent his head sidewise and inspected Willie coldly . " Happiestdamn moment of my life , " he growled . " I hope you get a good ship , sir . " " It 's about time I had one . " De Vriess walked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his shoes . A knot of chiefs and petty officers appeared in the port passageway by the galley . They watched the ex-captain as he came forward again . The oldest chief , a fat , hamfacedwater tender named Budge , whose belly bulged over his underslungbelt , stepped up to him . " Pardon me , Captain . " " What now ? " Budge took off his greasy khaki cap , revealing a bald head , fumbled with the cap and put it on again . " Well , nothing , sir . Except a few of the guys chipped in and got this . " He hauled a long flat box out of his pocket , and opened it , displaying a silver wrist watch . De Vriess stared at the watch , and then looked around at the fidgeting sailors . " Whose idea was this ? " " Well , everybody 's , sir . " " Well , everybody 's a damn fool . I ca n't accept it . It 's against Navy Regulations . " Budge glanced helplessly at the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought --  " A tall , tousle-headed shipfitter , De Lauche , spoke up , " You do n't always go by regs , sir --  " " That 's my goddamn trouble , " said De Vriess . " I 've been in the hooligan navy too long . " Budge scanned the captain 's unfriendly face , awkwardly juggled the open box , and set it on the dirty screen cover of a ventilator . " We meant it for the best , sir  --  " The dinging of a bell and the asthmatic cough of a motor announced that the gig was coming alongside . " You guys take an even128strain with the new skipper , " said De Vriess . " You chiefs and first-class P.O. 's run the ship , as you know damn well . Keep the men in line and give things a chance to break in  --  " He turned to Willie . " I am leaving the ship , sir . " " Aye aye , Captain . " They exchanged salutes . De Vriess put his hand on the ladder . His eye fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whaddya know , " he said . " Some silly bastard left a watch lying around . " He picked it out of the box and strapped it on . " Might as well steal myself a souvenir of this old bucket . Not a bad watch , at that , " he said , glancing at it critically . " What time is it , Mister Keith ? " " Four o'clock , sir , " said Willie . " Three-thirty , " grunted De Vriess , adjusting the hands . " I 'll always keep it half an hour slow , " he said to the sailors , " to remind me of the fouled-up crew of the Caine . Somebody toss down my gear . " He began to descend the ladder , and went out of sight . Then his head and arms reappeared . He looked up at the sailors and threw them a salute . " Thanks , " he said , and dropped down into the gig . The bags were lowered ; the boat pulled away . Willie watched it go , expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his ship . But he did no such thing . The last Willie saw of the ex-captain , he was slouched on the cushions under the canopy , reading a paper-bound mystery . " Attention on deck ! " called the gangway petty officer . Willie turned , stiffening . Captain Queeg , dressed in khaki shirt and trousers , was coming out of the starboard passageway . He looked differentwithout the double-breasted blues . He had surprisingly narrow , sloping shoulders , and was hollow-chested and potbellied . His forehead was furrowed , and there were three deep vertical wrinkles in the center ; his eyes squinted as though he were trying to see a long distance . Willie saluted . Queeg , peering around at the quarterdeck , ignoredthe gesture . " Gig gone ? " " Yes , sir . " " Willie , you 're out of hack as of now . Amnesty , you might say . " " Thank you , Captain , " Willie said warmly . Queeg stopped at the gangway desk and cast his eye here and there , rolling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked busily and without talking , heads bent . Queeg glanced down at the quartermaster 's log . " Captain de Vriess has n't been logged out . " " I was about to do that , sir , " spoke up Engstrand , the gangway petty officer . " Very well . Note the exact time of departure . " " Aye aye , sir . " 129Queeg watched Engstrand write the notation . The back of the signalman'sblue dungaree shirt was stenciled in red , Killer Engstrand . Hands off . The captain said , " Mr. Keith . " " Yes , sir . " " Pass the word to your relief that while we 're in Pearl the gangway watch will be stood in undress whites . " This was the uniform of the watch on the Moulton , and on most of the destroyers Willie had seen . The order pleased him . The Caine wasbeing restored to the Navy , with no time lost . " Aye aye , sir , " he snapped . Queeg resumed his scrutiny of the ship , ceaselessly rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and fro . " Okay , " he said . " Pass the word . Meeting of all officers in the wardroom at 1630 . " " Aye aye , sir . Shall I get a chief to stand by for me ? I 'll still have the watch then --  " " Have chiefs been standing OOD watches in port ? " " Well , yes , sir  --  " " Never mind getting a chief . You 're excused from the meeting . " The new commanding officer of the Caine walked off toward the port passageway . " Get a couple of your prisoners-at-large with some turpentine , " he said over his shoulder to Willie , " and have this mess cleaned up . " He pointed to the remains of the morning 's oil stain . ' We have no prisoners-at-large , sir . " " Oh ? . . . Well , then , the deck force . Get it cleaned up . " Captain Queeg went forward . THE NEW ORDERAt four-thirty the officers of the Caine were all seated around the wardroomtable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keefer and Maryk were drinking coffee . The others smoked or drummed their fingers on the green baize . Nobody spoke . The room was unnaturally tidy for that time of day . The magazines and paper-bound novels wereracked , and the coding devices usually scattered on the table were absent . " This is known in literature , " Keefer remarked in a low tone , stirringhis coffee , " as a pregnant pause . " " Go easy on the smart talk for a while , Tom , " murmured Adams. 130 " I 'm simply observing , " said Keefer , " that our new captain has a sense of drama . I thoroughly approve . " " Knock it off , " whispered Maryk , as the knob of the captain 's door turned . Gorton came out and looked around the table . " All present , Captain , " he called through the open door . Queeg entered the wardroom . With a scrape of chair legs the officers stood . The Caine officers had not performed this courtesy in a year ; several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively . " Sit down , sit down , gentlemen , " said Queeg in a light , joking tone . He sat in his chair , laid a fresh pack of cigarettes and a packet of matches in front of him , and looked around with a smile as his officers took their seats . He tore open the pack deliberately , lit a cigarette , and took the two steel balls out of his pocket . Rubbing them softly back and forth in his fingers , he began to speak . Occasionally he glanced up at their faces ; otherwise he kept his eyes on the cigarette or the steel balls . " Well , gentlemen , I just thought we ought to get acquainted . We 're going to be shipmates for a long time . You 're probably wondering about me , and I confess I 'm a little curious about you , though I 've formed some pretty good first impressions . I think this is a fine ship with a splendid wardroom of officers . I think we 're going to have a good cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it , some good hunting . I intend to give you every co-operation , and I expect the same in return . There is such a thing as loyalty upward , and such a thing as loyalty downward . I desire and expect to get absolute loyalty upward . If I do , you 'll get loyalty downward . If I do n't  --  well , I 'll find out why , and I 'll see to it that I do . " He laughed , indicating that this was a joke , and the officers nearest him smiled . " Now , there are four ways of doing a thing aboard ship  --  the right way , the wrong way , the Navy way , and my way . I want things on this ship done my way . Do n't worry about the other ways . Do things my way , and we 'll get along  --  Okay . Now , are there any questions ? " He looked around . There were no questions . He nodded with smilingsatisfaction . " Now , I 'm a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe the book is there for a purpose , and everything in it has been put in it for a purpose . When in doubt , remember we do things on this ship by the book . You go by the book and you 'll get no argument from me . You deviate from the book and you better have a half dozen damn good reasons  --  and you 'll still get a hell of an argumentfrom me . And I do n't lose arguments on board this ship . That 's one of the nice things about being captain . " He laughed again , and received the same smiles . Keefer was slowly shredding a cigarette as he listened. 131 " I want you to remember one thing , " Queeg went on . " Aboard my ship , excellent performance is standard . Standard performance is substandard . Sub-standard performance is not permitted to exist . Now , Rome was n't built in a day , and this ship has been sailing a hell of a long time without me , and as I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's anything that I want changed in anybody 's department you 'll find out about it fast enough . Meantime you will go on with your duties as before , remembering , as I say , that on my ship excellent performance is standard . " Keefer dropped the shred of the cigarette slowly into his coffee cup . " Well , now that I 've shot my face off , " said Queeg , " I 'll give anyone else who wants to the chance to do the same . . . . Nobody ? Okay . Then let 's have taut watches beginning as of now , if you feel that in any way you have n't been standing taut watches . And let 's have a taut ship . And , as I say , remember about loyalty upward and loyalty downward , and about excellent performance being standard . And , as I say , I regard you as a fine set of officers , and it 's a privilege to be in a wardroomwith you , and  --  and let 's keep it that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I thank you , and "  --  he laughed once more , an informal laugh that dismissed any tinge of martial austerity in what he had said  --  " all ashore that 's going ashore . " He rose , picking up his cigarettes . The officers stood . " Do n't get up , do n't get up , " he said . " Thank you all . " He went into his cabin . The officers looked around at each other . After a moment 's stillness Gorton inquired , " Anybody got anything on his mind ? " " When is the gig shoving off for the beach ? " said Keefer . " At 1800 , " said Gorton . " I 'm glad you asked , because you 'll have the gangway then . " " In a pig 's eye , " said Keefer genially . " I 'll be in the gig . I 've got me a date with a college graduate from the OWI office . She knows words of two syllables . It promises to be a highly intellectual evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in words of one syllable , you 're a dead duck , " said Gorton . " New watch-standing orders . Four officers aboard at all times in port . Me or the captain , and all three  --  repeat , all three  --  officers of the duty section . I believe your section has the duty ? " Keefer looked around and said , " Okay . Who 's standing by for good old Tommy ? " " I 'll take it , Tom , " said Maryk . " Thanks , Steve . I 'll do the same  --  " " Sorry , boys , " put in Gorton . " No stand-bys . " Keefer gnawed at his lips , scowling . Barrow rose , polishing his fingernails on his gabardine lapel . " I can take a dictionary along in the 132gig , Tommy , " he said daintily , " and bone up on two-syllable words . Does she know how to say Gladly ' ? " There was a bark of male laughterfrom all the officers . " Oh , look , Burt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're standing a cold-iron watch . There 's nothing to do but log vegetables aboard . Hell 's bells , in Tulagi we did n't keep four aboard , with the Tokyo Express running every night . " " Tom , I have never heard anything more persuasive , " said Gorton . " Your arguments move me to tears . Now will you go in and straighten out the captain ? " Carmody yawned and put his head on his hands . He said sleepily , " I see where the great American novel gets another chapter written tonight . " Keefer rose , uttered a short , blistering obscenity , and went to his room . He picked up the volume of Aurelius from his cluttered desk , and flung himself on his bunk . For ten minutes he read the soothing stoicisms of the Roman emperor . Then Gorton poked his head into the room . " Skipper wants to see you . Put on your saddle and report to the sawdust ring . " " With pleasure , " growled Keefer , leaping out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room , shaving . " Hello , hello , Tom , " he said . " Be with you in a minute . " He did not invite Keefer to sit . De Vriess had also ignored that formality with his department heads . They had been in the habit of dropping into the armchair without being asked . Keefer was not sure of his ground with Queeg . He leaned against the captain 's bunk , and lit a cigarette to show that he was not overawed . Queeg scraped away at his lathered face , humming . He wore only short drawers , and Keefer inspected with secret amusement the unprepossessing figure : flat hairless white chest , bulging little round stomach , and pallid skinny legs . " Lousy light , " remarked Queeg , squinting at his image in the mirror . " A wonder De Vriess did n't cut his throat . " " We can get you a brighter bulb , sir . " " Well , I do n't think that will be necessary --  Tell me , Tom , what do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a good kid . " " I mean , as an officer ? " " Well , he has a lot to learn , like any ensign . He 'll be fine . " " I 'm not interested in what he 'll be . As of now , I agree with you that he 's a nice kid  --  and also extremely immature . Particularly for a custodianof registered publications . " 133Keefer said hastily , " Sir , I 'm certain Keith can handle that assignmentto perfection  --  " " What training has he had for it ? " " Training ? " " I understand you had five months in communication school . " " Yes , sir . But you do n't need that to  --  " " Has he studied the registered publications manual ? " " I assume that in V-7 school they gave them the basic --  " " You ca n't assume a damn thing in the Navy , Tom , " said Queeg sharply , shifting his eyes to Keefer 's face and away again . " Could he pass a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without warning  --  " " Could you ? " " I certainly could , " snapped Keefer , offended . Rinsing his razor , Queeg said pleasantly , " I 'm sure of it . That 's why I think you should resume the duties of custodian . " " But , sir  --  " " The boy obviously knows nothing about classified stowage , Tom . Why , secret pubs are jammed and flopped around in that safe like garbage . And he has pubs in the radio shack , pubs on the bridge  --  not a single custody receipt to Keefer 's idea , as a matter of fact . Willie had inherited an appalling mess , but the novelist had airily laughed , saying , " This is n't a battleship , Willie . Forget about that custody-receipt malarkey . We 're all pals together on the Caine . " The ensign had innocently believedhim . Keefer said , " Well of course , sir , things could be a bit more shipshape  --  I'llget on his tail  --  " " Nothing doing . You relieve him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a ship in this squadron with a full lieutenantas custodian  --  it 's an ensign 's collateral duty  --  always is --  " " Well , I do n't want to be unreasonable about it , " said Queeg . " How long do you think it would take you to train up Keith as a custodian ? " " A few days , a week at most , and Willie can know that manual by heart . " " Fine . We 'll let it go at that . " " Aye aye , sir . Thank you . " " Do n't get me wrong , " said Queeg . " Meantime I want you to relieve him . This evening . " " What ! And go through an inventory and a transfer report ? And then , again , in reverse , three days from now ? " " We have lots of time and transfer forms . " " Sir , a department head who 's a top watch-stander does n't have an infinite amount of time . If you expect efficient performance of my main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your duties . This business may cut into your novel-writing a little . But of course , none of us is aboard to write novels . " In the poisoned silence that followed , Queeg opened his drawers . They slid to the deck , and he kicked them into a corner . " Well , " he said cheerfully , picking up a towel , " I hope the shower has hot water . " Keefer said in a slow , strangled tone , " Sir , do you object to my working on a novel ? " " Not at all , Tom , " said Queeg , taking a faded blue bathrobe out of his narrow closet . " An outside interest of an intellectual kind is recommendedfor all officers , as a stimulant to clear thinking and alertness . " " Fine , " said Keefer . " So long as your department is in every respect up to the mark , of course , " said Queeg . " I mean all reports up to date , all changes entered , all correspondence cleared , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in general , everything so perfectlyin hand that nothing remains to be done in your spare hours . Until such time , I think the Navy has first call on you . " " I do n't suppose there are many officers in the Navy who can say their departments are in such shape  --  " " Not one in a hundred , maybe . The average officer nowadays is lucky if he can keep abreast of his work and get six hours ' sleep a night . I guess that 's why we do n't have many novelists in the Navy , " said Queeg with a giggle . " But Captain de Vriess described you as a man of exceptional ability and I have every reason to hope that his judgment was sound . " Keefer put his hand on the doorknob . " Do n't rush off , " said the captain , unwrapping a soap cake . " Like to talk a bit more . " " I thought you were going to take a shower , sir . " " Well , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom , what kind of radio guard are we standing at the moment ? " he shouted over the drumming of the water on the metal deck of the shower room . A conference during a shower was new to Keefer . He pretended not to hear Queeg . After a moment the captain turned around , glowering from under his eyebrows as he soaped his groin . " Well ? " " I ca n't hear you very well over that water , Captain . " " I said what kind of radio guard are we standing ? " Two hours earlier , Keefer 's chief radioman had reported to the communicationsofficer that Queeg had been in the shack , minutely cross-134 135examining him about the radio guard . The new captain had been violentlydispleased to learn that they were merely copying local harbor broadcasts . So Keefer phrased his answer carefully . " Well , sir , we 're following standard Pearl Harbor procedure . We copy the harbor circuit . " " What ! " Captain Queeg looked amazed . " How about the Fox schedule ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soaped underneathit . " We pick up the skeds from the Betelgeuse . They guard for all destroyers in port . It 's standard procedure , " shouted Keefer . " You need n't scream . I hear you . Standard procedure for whom ? For destroyers in the same nest as the Betelgeuse ? We 're an hour away by motor whaleboat . What happens if an urgent despatch comes through for us ? " " They 're supposed to give it to us at once over the harbor circuit . " " Supposed to . And suppose they do n't ? " " Look , Captain , suppose the Betelgeuse blows up ? Suppose we do ? You have to assume certain normal conditions  --  " " You ca n't assume a goddamned thing in this Navy , " said Queeg . " Get that idea out of your head . Nothing will be assumed on this ship from now on , not a goddamned thing . " He rinsed the soap from his body and shut off the water . " Hand me that towel , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the captain , in pleasanter tones , rubbing himself with the towel , " in this Navy a commanding officer gets a chance to make one mistake  --  just one mistake , that 's all . They 're just waiting for me to make that one mistake . I 'm not going to make that mistake , and nobody on this ship is going to make it for me . I can keep my own radio gang from doping off , if it takes six months ' restrictionapiece , and breaking them all to seaman second class , to wake them up . But I ca n't do anything about some silly ape who dopes off on the Betelgeuse . Therefore I wo n't have the Betelgeuse standing guard for me . We 'll stand our own guard , and we 'll stand it around the clock , and we 'll stand it beginning as of now . Is that clear ? " " That 's clear , sir . " Queeg looked at him amiably . " Say , how about coming to the club with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the new watch orders I have to stay aboard . " " Oh , damn , " said the captain regretfully , as though he and Keefer were both victims of a silly rule . " Well , another time . Say , I 'd like to read your novel one of these days . Has it got plenty of sex in it ? " He giggled hopefully . Keefer said , " Will that be all now , sir ? " " That 's all , Tom , " said Queeg , shuffling down the passageway . 136The communications officer went into his room . He lay back on his bunk and picked up Aurelius . He lit a cigarette and took quick , deep puffs . Soon he lay in a cloud of gray curling smoke , reading . Willie Keith came to the quarterdeck at eleven o'clock that night , looking for Keefer . The gangway petty officer , spruce and surly in white uniform , told him that the OOD was inspecting the forward lines . Willie walked out on the breezy forecastle and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor , his feet dangling over the side , his gun belt lying on the deck . He was smoking , and staring up at the black starry night . " Hi , " said Willie . " Hi . " " Busy ? " " Not very . Composing a sonnet . " " Sorry to disturb you . " " Not at all . It 's a stinking sonnet . What can I do for you ? " " I 've been hitting that registered pubs manual for three hours . I think I 've got the first part memorized . " " Well done . " " Mind if I go over and visit my friend on the Moulton ? " " Go ahead . " " I looked in on Mr. Gorton to ask him . But he was asleep . " " Hell , you do n't need the exec 's permission to visit in the nest . Shove off . " " Thanks . Lots of luck with the sonnet . " In the immaculate wardroom of the Moulton several officers were sittingaround in dejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not among them . Willie went up the passageway to Keggs 's room , and pulled aside the green curtain . His friend was slumped at the desk , snoring , his long face resting on a pile of unfolded blueprints . The desk lamp was shining directly upon his closed eyes . His hands dangled awkwardly , the knuckles brushing the deck . Willie hesitated , then touched Keggs 's shoulder . The ensign started up wildly , with a gasp . He glared at Willie in horror for a moment , then recognition dawned and he greeted his friend with a sweet , sad smile . " Hello , Willie . " " What the hell are you studying blueprints for ? " said Willie . " I 'm taking an engineering course . " " Engineering ? You 're a deck man . " " Skipper 's got all the engineering men studying deck and all the deck men studying engineering . Makes us rounded officers , he says . " " That 's great , " said Willie , " providing you do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought we could play a game of chess , maybe . " 137 " Jesus , I 'd love it , Willie , " said Keggs cautiously . He peeked out into the passageway . " Looks like the coast is clear . I 'm game . Come on . " They went into the wardroom . Keggs took down a board and a box of red and black plastic chessmen , saying to a pudgy lieutenant , " When will he be back ? " " Not before midnight , I guess , " mumbled the lieutenant , who was slouched almost horizontal in an armchair , gazing dully at a ragged Life . " This is great , Willie . Glad you came over . Say , the hell with it . Let 's have a couple of cokes . " " Sure . " Keggs disappeared into the pantry and emerged in a moment with two frosty bottles . " Anybody else ? " he queried , looking around . Most of the officers ignored him . Two of them turned lackluster eyes on him and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the sloucher in the armchair , " I 'll go into shock . " Willie said , " You fellows still restricted ? " " Till Sunday , " said Keggs . " When we 'll probably get a despatch , " said the sloucher , " to proceed to Truk and sweep mines . " As Willie set up the chessmen , Keggs took a long pull at the coke bottle . " Ah , this is a great coke . I feel good . You guys mind if I turn on the radio ? " Nobody answered . He switched on a blast of jazz . " Hot dog . For a change , no Hawaiian music . Get those men ready , Willie . I 'm going to take your pants . Breep-de-broop , breep-de-broop  --  " He danced as he sang , a queer angular jig , his elbows stuck out , his arms dangling . The lieutenant in the armchair regarded him with a mixture of disgust and pity . " It 's amazing , " he said , " what a cat nap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Keggs dropped into the chair opposite Willie and moved the red king 's pawn . " Look , Willie , just remember this . When you hear a buzzer ring twice , that 's it . Game 's over . That 's the signal from the gangway that he 's come back on board . Just disappear , like the rest of us . Use the starboard passageway and you probably wo n't run into him --  " " Suppose I do run into him ? " " Be nonchalant , " spoke up the lieutenant in the armchair . " Kiss his behind and stroll off whistling Anchors Aweigh . " " How 's your new skipper ? " said Keggs . " A human being , for a change . " A couple of the officers yawned , stretched , and went to their rooms . " This is wonderful , " said Keggs , draining his coke . " We should do this more often , Willie . " The wardroom door opened , and Iron Duke Sammis entered , followed by Queeg . Keggs was unperturbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he saw the other officers getting to their feet , their faces dead blank . He uttered a strangled , sorrowful neigh and leaped up , overturning the chessboard . The chessmen bounced and clattered all over the deck . " Gentlemen , " said Iron Duke Sammis , " this is Commander Queeg , the new commanding officer of the Caine . Good evening , Mr. Keith . " " Good evening , sir . Good evening , Captain , " said Willie . " Well , I 'm glad to see I own a chess player , " said Queeg . " I 've always wanted to pick up the game . " " Wonderful relaxation , " said the Iron Duke . " Too bad it eats up so much time . I have n't shot a game since the war started . But since my communicator seems to have the leisure , I may go in for it again  --  " " Sir , all tonight 's decodes are on your desk , " said Keggs tremulously , " and I did two and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game long enough to let Captain Queeg and myself have a little fresh coffee ? " " Yes , sir . Certainly , sir . " The two captains went into Sammis ' cabin . Keggs ran to the pantry and came out with Silexes full of clear water . " What the hell , " said Willie , " are you a steward 's mate , too ? Where 's your burnt cork ? " " Easy , Willie . I 'm wardroom mess treasurer . It 's quicker to make it myself than to go roust out a mess boy , that 's all . " He began to pick up the chess pieces . " Game 's over , I take it . " " Oh , hell , yes . " " Well , I 'll stick around for some of that coffee  --  if I 'm allowed to drink from the same bowl as the gods . " Keggs looked over his shoulder at the captain 's cabin . " Sure , stick around . But please , Willie , do n't say those things  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecastle to go to the Moulton , the communications officer stared skyward for a while , then took a pad , pencil , and flashlight from his pocket and began to scribble verses . In a few minutes the dim figure of Maryk came up the forecastle . Greeting Keefer morosely , the first lieutenant pulled open a narrow hatch forwardof the anchor engine , reached his hand inside , and turned a switch . A shaft of yellow light rose from the hatch . Keefer said , " What goes on in the paint locker , this time of night ? " " Title B inventory . "
