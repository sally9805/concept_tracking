Cigarettes drooping mournfully from the corners of their mouths , the French farmers clustered in the cornfield , waiting for the show to begin . A bottle of wine protruded from the hip pocket of one , a long loaf of bread from another . Professor Jay C. Hackleman , a University of Illinois agronomist on loan to the Mutual Security Agency , mounted the corn wagon . " Where 's Elmer ? " somebody whispered . In a moment Elmer Carlson , 43 , a bronzed , strapping Iowa farmer and onetime U.S. national cornhusking champion , was found-on hands &; knees inspecting a newfangled carbide scarecrow . Looking like a miniature 75-mm. cannon and operating on the same principle as a flash buoy , it was like nothing Elmer had ever seen in Iowa . He left it reluctantly , to join the professor in the corn wagon . <P> " We 're very pleased to see you here , " the professor began , through an interpreter . " It shows your interest in hybrid corn . . . " BOOM ! went the crow-chaser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Frenchmen shuffled their feet and watched Elmer , who was nonchalantly strapping an evil-looking husking hook to his right wrist . At last the speech was over , and Elmer strode into the cornfield . He seized an ear or two , ripped the husks open with his hook and tossed them into the wagon . One of the Frenchmen spat . Then Elmer took off his shirt . " Okay , Thorson , " he called to his companion , a onetime Iowa farmboy now clerking at the U.S. Embassy in Paris . " Let 's go ! " <P> Corn on the Bang-Board . Down they went like angry threshing machines through the rows of hybrid corn , grabbing an ear of corn in the left hand , ripping open the husk with the hook , seizing the ear with the right hand , tearing the husk open with the left , snapping the stripped ear off with the right and flipping it against the bang-board of the wagon , all in a single uninterrupted operation . The pair tossed corn with machine-gun precision , hitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oiyoiyoi , oiyoiyoi ! " shrilled one of the astounded French farmers , seizing his spinning head in both hands . When all the corn was husked , everybody gathered around to try out the hooks . Even the local priest joined in the trials , while Elmer passed out pencils stamped with his picture . <P> Since mid-September , Elmer has done his act over &; over for the benefit of farmers in Italy , France and Holland , all of which are increasing their corn crop , to save import dollars . MSA figured that the farmers could raise even more if they learned to harvest in the traditional U.S. style instead of lugging each ear home to be stripped at a husking bee around the family hearth . <P> Donkey in the Lobby . The French took to the idea from the very beginning . Last week , when Elmer left to go on to Holland , the French farmers insisted he come back once more and teach them to teach still others before he left for good . Elmer promptly accepted the invitation . For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those cannon scarecrows . An uninhibited man who startled the Democratic conventioneers in Chicago last July by leading a live donkey into the lobby of the Palmer House , Elmer badly wants a cannon scarecrow to take home to Iowa ; he thinks he might even set it up on the rail of his ship and " let go a real Iowa salute " at the Statue of Liberty on the way home .
