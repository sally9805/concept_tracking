txt Fire Chief Peter Loftus , whose career as head of the city 's uniformed fire fighters has at times been a stormy one , has applied for retirement . A. Fire Department spokesman said last night that Chief Loftus had applied for a pension of three-quarters of his present $15,000-a-yeah salary . The Chief is 61 years old and lives at 33-11 149th Street , Flushing , Queens . He has served in the department for thirty-five years , the last eight in his present post . The request for three-quarters pay was based on a claim by Chief Loftus that he had suffered a permanent injury to his back three years ago in an automobile accident in the line of duty . This , he said , disabled him for active fire fighting . Unless injured on duty , a fireman 's retirement pay is one-half of his salary . On July 1 , when an increase in his salary from $12,500 to $15,000 a year became effective , Chief Loftus went on vacation , spokesman said . He is reported to be in the Adirondack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to Fire Commissioner Edward F. Cavanagh Jr . requesting retirement . This letter , in an unstamped envelope , was delivered by hand last Friday to the Commissioner 's office .

Commissioner Cavanagh was quoted by the spokesman as saying that he had no comment on the letter because it was-. " a matter that must . be decided by the Pension Board. ?

If Loftus is retired , his sue- , cessor will be a ranking chief who will hold the title of acting chief of department pending the promulgation of a new civil service list for the post . ) A claim of disability also played a part in Mr. Loftus ' original promotion to his present job . A veteran of World War I , he placed fourth on a list of eligible men for the post in a Civil Service examination . Because of the disability claim , based on arthritis of the back contracted in war service , he was automatically placed at the head of the list . Mr. Loftus was appointed Chief of Department in July , 1948 , over the opposition of Frank J. Quayle , who then was Mayor O'Dwyer 's Fire Commissioner , and Deputy Fire Commissioner James J. Moran .

In 1949 , Mr. Loftus was found guilty of violating department regulations by attending a Christmas party in a fire house . His punishment was a reprimand . Chief Loftus was a supporter of Vincent R.
