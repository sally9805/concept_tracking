The umbilical cord connecting these two airplanes is a refueling device recently developed by Boeing Airplane Co . Most refueling of airplanes from flying " tankers " has been done by a flexible hose which the airplane must catch and attach . Because the old system has many disadvantages , Boeing switched to this rigid , tubular " boom " that swings below the tail of the tanker . The position in which it hangs can be controlled by small movable vanes near the boom 's tip . A man in the tail-gunner 's turret of the tanker plane watches the receiving plane approach , and " flies " the boom into a socket on top of the nose . Then the fuel is forced through the tube under pressure .
