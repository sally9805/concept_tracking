For years Hollywood 's movie companies have presented a united front against television by refusing to sell their backlog of old films for re-release on TV . Last week came the first big break . The man who made it was Thomas F. O'Neil , 40 , son of Akron 's General Tire &; Rubber Co . President William O'Neil and boss of the company 's General Teleradio subsidiary . <P> In eight years as head of the entertainment end of his father 's business , young Tom O'Neil had put together a $35 million chain of five wholly owned TV stations , and a 569-radio-station network , stretching from New England to the West Coast . Now , for $25 million more , borrowed from the Chase Manhattan Bank , he bought Howard Hughes 's RKO Radio Pictures Inc. , * its moviemaking facilities , distribution system , and a library of some 700 films , including such popular favorites as Gunga Din , Citizen Kane , Stage Door , Little Women , Lost Patrol , The Informer . In addition , RKO has two new films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both starring No. 1 box-office attraction John Wayne . <P> Radio-TVman O'Neil also got what was once one of Hollywood 's busiest studios and is now one of its sickest . Millionaire Hughes had chopped the studio 's 2,000-man payroll to 300 , lost his distribution contracts for Walt Disney and Sam Goldwyn films , made fewer pictures ( not a foot of RKO film has been shot this year ) . He haggled steadily for six days and nights with O'Neil over the sale . <P> At one point , the two men piled into Hughes 's Convair and took off for Las Vegas . As the plane droned over the desert , Hughes and O'Neil dickered in the cockpit , while two lawyers dozed in the seats behind them . At one point Hughes casually turned the piloting over to O'Neil ( although he had never flown a plane ) , came back after a while and said , " Well , Tom , you 're a great pilot . " <P> Later when the deal was finally sewn up , O'Neil was flown back to General Tire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled into bed , groaning : " I have n't had any sleep for 36 hours . He 's a very clever man , a very clever man . " Hughes 's estimated profit : about $6,500,000 . <P> " He Makes Money . " But the profit to Hughes may be small compared to what O'Neil hopes to make on the deal . On past performance , he may be just what RKO needs . A burly ( 6 ft. 4 in. , 215 Ibs. ) ex-Holy Cross ( ' 37 ) football end , O'Neil first learned his way around his father 's tire company after college , did a four-year stint in the Navy , part of it skippering an LST in the Pacific . When he got back in 1945 , he went to work for General Tire in earnest . Three years before , his father had bought New England 's 25-radio station Yankee Network for $1,340,000 to broaden General Tire 's tax base and to advertise General Tire 's products . In 1946 , young Tom took over the network and quickly expanded . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Boston 's WNAC-TV ) in 1948 , from there started building up General Tire 's other big radio-TV interest : the Mutual Network , of which General Tire owned 20% . <P> Mutual 's other owners ( each with 20% ) were the West Coast Don Lee network , the Chicago Tribune , Macy 's department store , and a group of smaller investors .
