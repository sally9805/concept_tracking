If painting is deaf poetry , as Simonedes suggested , then poetry is blind painting . William Blake 's art was complete , neither deaf nor blind . One of the great lyric poets in the language , he was almost as outstanding an artist . And his pictures , like his poems , partake of music . Blake 's figures are all dancing in compositions as supple and clear as Mozart . If they do not seem particularly real , it is because Blake saw through the real world into a clearer place . " Imagination is my world , " he said , adding that " he who does not imagine in stronger and better lineaments than his perishing and mortal eye can see , does not imagine at all . " <P> It took the world a long time to see through to William Blake . In his own time he was an obscure figure ; for decades after his death , he was considered no more than an interesting eccentric . Now , 200 years after his birth , Poet-Painter Blake is receiving homage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around the turn of the 19th century Blake walked the streets of London as if invisible . The city was the portrait center of the world . Sir Joshua Reynolds was discoursing at the Royal Academy . Two expatriate Americans , Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley , plied an elegant trade . Blake meanwhile engraved and illustrated his own poems , and did illustrations for Milton , Dante and the Bible , working prodigiously to create some of the most magnificent and moving volumes ever made , which he sold , when he could sell them at all , for little more than a dinner . <P> Until recently , Blake was popularly known as the man who had somehow managed to lodge a handful of poems , such as " Tyger ! Tyger ! burning bright , " in children 's consciousness . The fact that his Tyger symbolizes , among many other things , the French Revolution , seemed typically odd , as did his hatred of churches and of the Industrial Revolution . But Blake 's angers and oddities gradually cease to annoy as his radiance grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's many Blake exhibitions in British museums had their climax in last week 's display at London 's Tate Gallery . Washington 's National Gallery of Art this fall hung a vast Blake exhibition drawn from both England and America . Articles , lectures and broadcasts on Blake are being read and heard in many tongues , including Hindi and Japanese . A color film of his graphic works is in production in England . A memorial bust of Blake , by Sir Jacob Epstein , was placed this year in the Poets ' Corner of Westminster Abbey . <P> New books about Blake appear each season . Critically , none has bettered Albert Roe 's profound study of the artist 's illustrations for Dante , published in 1953 ( Princeton University ; $20 ) . But the new Complete Writings of William Blake ( Nonesuch Press-Random House ; $12.50 ) fills a basic need . Most spectacular is a 2-ft. - high volume of Blake 's illustrations for the Bible , sponsored by the Blake Trust and distributed in the U.S. ( by Philip Duschnes ) at a stiff $95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
