With a fanfare that was all but lost on the audience that he most sought to impress , British Colonial Secretary Alan Lennox-Boyd last week offered rebellious Cyprus a constitution and a parliament . <P> Drawn up by Lord Radcliffe , the eminent British jurist who arbitrated the border between India and Pakistan in 1947 , the long-heralded " liberal constitution " proposed to give control of domestic affairs to a 36-man legislature in which Greek Cypriots , who make up four-fifths of the island 's 500,000 inhabitants , would hold a comfortable majority of 24 seats . Of the remaining twelve members , six would be appointed by the British Governor and six elected by the Turkish minority . In fact , however , the constitution would leave ultimate power in Cyprus in the hands of the British Governor , who , besides retaining overt control of defense , foreign affairs and internal security , would possess " reserve powers " which , in effect , give him an irrevocable veto over legislation . <P> Freedom Must Wait . Far more serious an objection to the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the British proposals made no real concession to the basic Greek Cypriot demand for self-determination , i.e. , union with Greece . To have made any such substantial concession at this moment might have so enraged the flag-waving , Suez-group backbenchers as to threaten Sir Anthony Eden 's stay in office . But there was more than one lesson to be drawn from Britain 's failure in Egypt . Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck , veteran African desert fighter of World War II , wrote to London 's Sunday Times : " Unless I , as a soldier , am grossly at fault in my estimate of Cyprus ... it has none or practically none of the requisites of an efficient military base . " Unshaken by this argument , Lennox-Boyd last week clung stubbornly to the line that Cyprus is strategically vital and that self-determination must wait . If Greek Cypriots continued to insist on union with Greece , he said , the " inevitable " result would be partition of Cyprus ' 3,572 square miles into Greek and Turkish zones . <P> " Illiberal &; Undemocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek control of Cyprus would pose an intolerable threat to Turkey 's security , found the Radcliffe constitution " logical material for negotiation " and Lennox-Boyd 's partition talk " an interesting , attractive idea . " Yet one high British official who should know insists that " partition could never work because . . . you would have to shift whole villages . There is no one area where Turks predominate . " Greek Foreign Minister Evangelos Averoff denounced the British plan as " illiberal and undemocratic " and angrily pressed Greece 's demand for a U.N . debate on self-determination for Cyprus . In Cyprus itself , the port of Famagusta was closed down by a protest strike . <P> Spruced-Up Faade . What Lord Radcliffe 's constitution offered Cyprus was , in fact a faade of self-government carefully designed to preserve what the British in India used to call their paramountcy . The British government declared its readiness to transport a " reasonable " number of Cypriots to the lonely Seychelles Islands to discuss the Radcliffe constitution with Archbishop Makarios , exiled leader of the enosis ( union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
