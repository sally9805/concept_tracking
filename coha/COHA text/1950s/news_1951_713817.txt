WAKEFIELD.JOSE VAZQUEZ-AMARAL.DOROTHY NORMANRICH ... pg . 24 Letters to The Times Music Auditorium Favored Need Seen for a Publicly Owned Opera House and Concert Hall To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Two articles appearing in THE NEW YORK TIMES of May . 4 would seem to indicate a contrasting approach to the problem of support for musical organizations . One of them concerns the opening in London on May 3 by the Archbishop of Canterbury , the King and Queen and the ' Royal Princesses , of a new concert hall seating 3,000 people and costing $6,000,000 . This hall was built by the London County Council and belongs to the people of London . In another column attention is called to contributions netting $650,000 having been raised by our Metropolitan Opera Fund in its effort to complete its drive for $750,000 . Mr. Sloan , president of the Metropolitan Opera Association , in commenting on the need for the remaining $100,000 , rejects the suggestion of " Government subsidy " as not being , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He appeals to the " mercantile establishments , " in recognition of the Metropolitan 's opening night being " synonymous with the opening of the fall fashion season " to contribute to his campaign . Funds From Individuals Is it really necessary to comment on the different approach indicated by these two news items ? We all know what the " American way " has been in the past : the ability of a few private citizens to pay subsidies and deficits to defray the expenses of all our musical organizations throughout the country . We all know now that in our city the Metropolitan Opera and the Philharmonic-Symphony are in desperate need of funds if they are to continue to exist at all , and that today no private citizens or even " mercantile establishments " can in the long run afford the luxury of such private organizations . Is there not an " American way " to solve this problem ? It has been the contention of this writer for many years that only by the support of the New York City public through taxation can musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept afloat . Twenty-five cents a year , the amount needed to cross a bridge or go through a tunnel once , will bring $1,750,000 on a per capita tax from the citizens of Greater New York to provide funds for the Metropolitan Opera , the Philharmonic-Symphony , and for its own baby , the New York City Center , or for a dime a year $700,000 can be raised if a quarter is too much . It will take mountains of legislation to bring this about , but our all-time champion of municipal culture , the late lamented Mayor La Guardia , had it in mind in connection with the setting up of the New York City Center . Property of Citizens All we need is another Robert Moses to allocate and administer the funds , for in truth do not the arts and the treasures of the cultural world belong to the citizens of New York as much as do their bridges , parks , parkways , beaches , zoos , libraries and museums ? Is not this also " the American way " ? The average citizen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest proportion toward the Metropolitan Opera Fund drive , listened to the opera for nothing on a commercially sponsored radio broadcast . The listeners would be surprised to find that if they came to New York even the amount of their generous contributions might not guarantee them a good seat at the Met , or they might find themselves in one . of hundreds of seats in that venerable auditorium where they could not even see the stage . This means that we , too , need a publicly owned opera house and concert hall combined . Many years ago members of the Metropolitan Opera Association realized ' this need and today this is almost a necessity if we are to have opera and concerts for a large public at the price the public can pay . The experiment at the New York City Center has shown that the public exists and that even now for short seasons opera , ballet and drama can be given without appreciable deficit . There is an " American way . " GERALD F. WARBURG . New York , May 9 , 1951 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW YORK , TIMES : The letter in THE TIMES of April 30 from Angela Diller states : " They the founding fathers saw to it that every coin  --  every cent and nickel and dime and quarter  --  that has jingled in our pockets these many years should bear the inscription In God We Trust ' . " Where did Miss Diller obtain her misinformation I " In God We Trust " has ' been on our coins only since 1864 , when the inscription was placed on a twocent coin by order of Salmon P. Chase , Secretary of the Treasury . The inscriptions placed upon our coins by the founding fathers were secular injunctions , such as " Mind Your Business " on the Fugio cent , the first coin issued under the authority of the United States . SHERMAN D. WAKEFIELD . New York , May 2 , 1951 . Reporting Latin America To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wish to express my genuine delight in reading Herbert L. Matthews ' article in THE TIMES of-May 7 entitled " Prosperity Spurs Mexican Progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arrival in this country as exchange professor at Tulane University , Swarthmore College and now as specialist on Latin America at the State University of New Jersey , I can say that I do not recall having read a more objective , impartial and informed article on my native land than the one Mr. Matthews has given us . It is this type of reporting , and not the sensationalist kind that too often gains the pages of many newspapers in this country , which will do a great deal in furthering Bolivar 's dream of an American amphictyony . Democracy is also something you believe in , like religion , despite its obvious failings ? and we should have more of it more frequently . I was also pleased and a little amazed at Mr. Matthews ' unusual " perspective " in things Latin-American ; he must have seen a lot and read a lot , with an excellent digestion for Latin-American fare . JOSE VAZQUEZ-AMARAL . New Brunswick , N. J. , May 7 , 1951 . Mandate to Aid India Swift Action Urged in View of Popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YORK TIMES : According to a very recent Gallup Poll , 59 per cent of Americans questioned clearly " approve the idea of a gift of grain to India . " Mr. Gallup reports also that there is " virtually no difference * * * between the views of Democrats and Republicans " on this crucial subject . Despite this forthright mandate to send food to India , Congress itself has failed to act , even while millions continue to be threatened with wholly avoidable starvation . Both the Senate and the House should be urged to act without delay on the legislation before them . And every effort must be made to block any such amendment as that reported as favored by Senators McCarran , Ferguson and Bridges , according to which political strings would be tied to aid given . No one can question either the availability of American food grains at this moment or the will of the American people to aid those who are attempting , against the greatest of odds , to maintain one of the strongest bulwarks of democracy in the East . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drafted by the Bishops of the Methodist Church , signed by Bishop Arthur J. Moore of Atlanta and Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam of New York , who speak well for the conscience of America in warning that the United States must " avoid any semblance of dictating terms that will injure self-respect , that will drive a hard bargain or that will make capital out of another 's dire need . " They wisely point out , too , that " help given soon and sympathetically will be convincing proof of our brotherly concern and a more effective answer to the sneers and pseudo promises of communism than any other thing we can do or say . " The way in which to gain and maintain the trust and cooperation of India is to act in good faith , generously and promptly . We have not a moment to lose . DOROTHY NORMAN . Chairman , American Emergency Food Committee for India . New York , May 10 , 1951 . Court Practice in Loyalty Cases To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Recent discussion of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , by the special correspondent of THE NEW YORK TIMES and by Arthur Krock has referred to the opinion of Mr. Justice Burton as " controlling . " In fact , that opinion is not " controlling . " It secured the concurrence of only one other justice , and practice accordingly dictated that it be labeled not the " opinion of the court " but the announcement of the judgment of the court . This difference in terminology is not based on mere technical considerations . An " opinion of the court " ? that is , an opinion which has secured the assent of a majority of the justices ? is a precedent both as to the result reached and as to the reasoning which led to that result . An opinion which announces the judgment of the court is no precedent with respect to its reasoning , either as a matter of constitutional law or otherwise . It is only the considered expression of minority views . The opinion of Mr. Justice Burton is no more authoritative than the opinions of other justices who reached the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bipoklyn , N. Y. , May 5 , 1951 . Costs of Government To THE EDITOR OF THR NEW YORK TIMES : It is estimated it would take 35 cents out of every dollar of income received by the American people to pay for national , state and local government spending proposed for 1952 . If taxpayers do not want this to happen they should speak up , HOWARD W. TONER . Brooklyn , May 3 , 1951.
