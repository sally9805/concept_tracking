txt Political analysts of the Yugoslav Communist party put forward today the theory that the Chinese Communists had sent their armies into Korea to challenge the Soviet Government 's pretension to be the dominant power in Asia . The analysts ' reasoning runs thus : The Soviet Government started the Korean war to demonstrate its leadership in Asia . The plan collapsed as a result of the defeat of the North Korean armies . The Chinese Communist Government then moved its troops into Korea . The Yugoslav analysts assert that the Chinese Communists have now superseded the Russians in Korea and that the Soviet Government will not succeed in getting them out . Previous Analysis Recalled In examining the Yugoslav theory it should be recalled that it was the Yugoslav Communist leaders who were the first to warn the Western world that it was the Soviet Government 's strategy to prevent the seating of the Chinese Communists in the United Nations Security Council and so embroil the Peiping regime with Washington as to prevent any possible contact . The Yugoslav interpretation coincides in the main with an apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokyo on Dec. 24 , that the Russians and Chinese Communists were contesting for control of Korea . The Chinese were said to have moved into North Korea after Communists educated in China had been pushed out of important posts in the North Korean Communist hierarchy and replaced by Soviettrained officials . Since the Chinese intervention , it was added , the Soviet-oriented Communists seem to have been thrust into . the background . The new Yugoslav theory was contained in a two-page unsigned editorial in the current issue of The Review of International Affairs . It can be summarized as follows : The Soviet Government , which had pretentions to play a role as the dominant power in Asia saw the emergence of a Communist China with considerable uneasiness . This uneasiness was accentuated during the prolonged negotiations in Moscow between Mao Tse-tung and the Soviet Government . The treaty that was negotiated finally gave China no particular economic benefits and on the contrary pledged Peiping to continue ' many important privileges granted to the Soviet Government . Impelled by the desire to demonstrate that it intended to play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to activate its policy on that continent . North Korea , which was a Soviet sphere of influence , had a common frontier with the new Chinese Communist state , and the Soviet Government therefore decided to select Korea as the scene of its first demonstration of power for Mr , Mao 's benefit to prove that Moscow was to remain the seat of the Communist world . A successful military operation in South Korea would enhance the Soviet Government 's prestige in Asia . The Soviet Government 's plan fell to the ground , however , as a result of the military defeat inflicted upon its North Korean puppet armies , and the boycott of the United Nations Security Council was ended so that the Soviet Government could send its delegation back to Lake Success in an effort to salvage its position in Korea through diplomatic maneuvers . The second blow to the Soviet Government 's abortive plan was tha intervention of the Chinese Communists in North Korea . The anonymous editorial writer said : " China , which had thus far been in the background , leaped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not saving the reputation of Moscow but were again serving the assertion of China as a new factor in Asia . The former Soviet sphere of influence is under the occupation of Chinese troops . " The writer went on say that the Western Governments had pinned their hopes for a peaceful solution of the Korean problem on negotiations with Moscow but that attention now had been shifted to Communist China . " The action , which was supposed to strengthen the position of the U. S. S. R. in relation to the U.S. A and confirm the IL S. S. R. as a leading Asiatic power , ended with an unexpected ( and undoubtedly unwanted ) result  --  the assertion of China as the new Asiatic power , " the editorial said . " * * * The Government of the U. S. S. R. will doubtless be forced perceive that the attempt to impose its tutelage on Peiping was just as unrealistic as the American de jure ignoring of the People 's Republic of China .
