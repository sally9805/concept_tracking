With its orchestra , singers and dancers , straight man and comedian , Garroway at Large ( Sun . 10 p.m. , NBCTV ) might be just another TV variety show . But on the TV screen , something surprising happens . Last week , back on the air after a summer vacation , Garroway again demonstrated an out-of-the-ordinary pace , outlook and quality that TV men have come to consider characteristic of the whole " Chicago school " of television . <P> Partly the difference lies in a freshness and informality . Partly it lies in a brash approach that encourages visual puns ( e.g. , after a harmonica quartet , Garroway is shown eating his way through an ear of corn ) . <P> With Imagination . Big , 37-year-old Dave Garroway , an amateur mechanic , gem cutter , tile-setter , photographer , bird fancier , cabinetmaker and bibliophile , says his scriptless show is planned by " four guys sitting around a table . " The other three , all under 35 , are Writer Charlie Andrews , an ex-hobo ; Producer Ted Mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ex-drummer . The Garroway show 's top council , with Burr Tillstrom ( Kukla , Fran &; Ollie ) and Documentary Expert Ben Park , make up the brain trust of the close-knit , argumentative group that has developed the Chicago school . Explains NBC 's Chicago Station Manager Jules Herbuveaux : " New York thinks there 's nothing wrong with TV that the stage ca n't cure , and Hollywood thinks there 's nothing wrong with TV that movies ca n't cure . Chicago goes its own way . " <P> The Chicago group 's imaginative approach has been born of necessity . Lacking big budgets , elaborate equipment and big-name talent , they are forced to shortcut the elaborate . They specialize in what they call " simplified realism " and " ad-lib drama . " By banning studio audiences they can use the four walls of every set ; short on cameras , booms and overhead trolleys , they never switch from one camera to another without a good reason . <P> Long &; Short . Out of these techniques have come such shows as Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on nearby Woodstock , Ill. ; Ted Mills 's Portrait of America and Crisis ; Charlie Andrews ' Studs ' Place , which drew 4,000 letters of protest ( mostly from New York and Philadelphia ) when it was dropped last month , and the Ransom Sherman Show , dedicated to the incurable inefficiency of the American male . <P> Of such shows , thus far only Garroway at Large , sponsored by Congoleum-Nairn Corp. , has been a conspicuous commercial success , but their total impact on TV has been enormous . Fred Allen , due to make his own TV bow this month , says : " The Chicago shows are making an effort to do something . They 're short on money , short on talent , but long on inventiveness . " And NBC 's Herbuveaux , who believes in a change of pace , adds : " After half an hour of being beat over the head by New York , people enjoy a half-hour of leaning back with Chicago .
