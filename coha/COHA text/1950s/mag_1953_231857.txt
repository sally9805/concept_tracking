During the summer doldrums , newspapers give away free dishes , free trips to Miami , free encyclopedias , free almost anything-just to keep circulation going . This summer , Hearst 's tabloid New York Mirror is simply giving away money . By last week , after one month of its " Lucky Bucks Treasure Hunt , " the Mirror had tossed out some $10,000 . <P> The rules of the treasure hunt are simple . Each day the Mirror prints the serial numbers of 14 to 19 " Lucky Bucks " : dollar bills put into circulation via gas stations , food counters , newsstands , department stores , taxicabs , etc . Anyone who spots a Lucky Buck can claim his treasure - ranging from $25 for an ordinary Lucky Buck to $1,000 for the " giant " variety . <P> To keep the contest from being an illegal lottery , the Mirror was careful to specify : " It is not necessary to buy copies of the Mirror to win an award . You may inspect a copy of the paper free . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away as Miami , Fla. ( where a treasure hunter spotted a Lucky Buck originally spent in a White Plains store ) , people were buying the tabloid to compare its numbers with their dollars . Lucky Bucks not redeemed in seven days lost their magic ; after that , they were worth 100 cents . <P> Winners ranged from filling station attendants to doormen , from airplane riveters to landladies . Most of the " Lucky Buckaroos " came in happily to have their pictures taken , bills streaming from their ears or swirling around their heads . Mirror Publisher Charles McCabe was just as happy ; July circulation was above normal .
