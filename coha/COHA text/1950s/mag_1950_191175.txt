Readers of the Dallas News ( circ. 163,212 ) sometimes wonder whether they have a symphony orchestra , civic theater and a dozen other cultural organizations for them to enjoy , or just to give the News 's Amusements Editor John Rosenfield something to write about . The fact is that culture in Dallas has blossomed like a rose on the dry plains of the Southwest , thanks largely to Rosenfield . A secondary result is that his column and reviews are among the best-read of News features . <P> Since he became amusements editor 25 years ago , " Rosy " Rosenfield has continuously beaten the drums for talent and money to back new cultural enterprises . Among the enterprises he has promoted : the Dallas Little Theater ( where he doubled as actor ) , the Dallas Symphony Orchestra , Margo Jones 's repertory theater , and the Civic Playhouse . As the arbiter of art in Dallas , Rosy has been behind almost as many feuds as first nights . <P> Last week he let his readers in on another feud at the opening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conductor , Walter Hendl , " whose continuance on our podium was in doubt as late as September . " Even to readers unaware that Rosenfield himself had spread the rumor of Hendl 's departure , the review was a tipoff . If Rosy has his way-and he usually does-Hendl 's " continuance on the podium " was indeed in doubt . <P> Still fresh in the city 's memory was Rosy 's feud with Jacques Singer , whom he had enthusiastically welcomed as the first professional conductor of the symphony . Before long , Rosy turned against him . Singer became so enraged by Rosenfield 's criticisms that he took to publishing handbills and making speeches in his own defense during concert intermissions . <P> Rosenfield 's reviews , written with the raciness of a sportwriter 's or pressagent 's copy ( both of which he once turned out ) , are backed by generally good judgment , but there are exceptions . After a local performance of George Sessions Perry 's play , My Granny Van , Rosenfield told a friend of Perry 's : " Remind George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in a book Perry wrote on Texas . The next day Rosy wrote a stinging review of the play . <P> Born in Dallas , the son of a well-to-do real-estate man , Rosenfield broke into the arts doing second-string reviews for the late Burns Mantle on the old New York Evening Mail , later worked as a press-agent ( he once drove a covered wagon down Broadway to exploit a movie ) . <P> When he got back to Dallas , he was offered a job by a News editor who said : " You can cover City Hall . It 's a Ku Klux Klan administration and we are an anti-Klan paper . Now do you want it ? " Rosenfield said yes , made good at the job and later got the chance to be amusements editor . When one of his first reviews praised a local production of Eugene O'Neill 's Anna Christie , Publisher George Bannerman Dealey called him on the carpet for saying nice things of a play about a prostitute . Rosenfield convinced Dealey that he had a right to express his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he also covers radio , TV , records and nightclubs .
