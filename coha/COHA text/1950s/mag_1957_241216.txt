Among dentists whose patients had trouble enunciating " s , " or " t , " or " th , " there used to be a standard joke : " What we need is English-speaking dentures . " In the March Journal of the American Dental Association . Dentist Howard E. Kessler of Cleveland reports that the jokesters were right . It is much harder to make dentures for English-speaking patients than for those with another mother tongue . <P> Cleveland , with a big foreign-born population , has given Dr. Kessler ample opportunity to see the differences . The vast majority of patients whose native language is not English , he finds , form the sounds of n , l , t , d , s and z with the tip of the tongue placed near to or against the back of the upper front teeth . No matter what a dentist does in fitting new plates , he is unlikely to interfere with this process . But patients with English as their native language hold the tongue higher - against the alveolar ridge just behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sounds . And that is precisely where the average dentist making an upper plate puts part of the denture base . Result : the English-language patient 's tongue hits a foreign object right behind the alveolar ridge and does n't know what to make of it . This causes especially severe trouble when the base is too thick . <P> Dr. Kessler 's prescription : dentists fitting upper plates should make tape recordings of their patients ' speech before , during and after fitting . And they should be sure to leave plenty of room for the English-speaking tongue to move .
