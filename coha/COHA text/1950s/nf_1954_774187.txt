txt  | We do not know what languages the hunters of the Late Pleistocene spoke , but we may be sure they were numerous . Simple hunters living today have almost as many languages as there are groups of bands which come together for ceremonies in the fat seasons . We may be equally sure that they were adequate , in that every kind of animal hunted had a whole roster of names to indicate its sex , age , and condition ; that if snow was important , a dozen or more words would designate snow , while the list of numbers may have gone from three or six to " many , " i.e. , infinity . Other symbols expressed the relationship of man to nature . Each category of useful beast or herb had its soul , which presented itself from time to time to people , giving men important messages . Game laws and laws of conservation were rigidly enforced by a system of tabus which automatically protected important species at certain seasons , through the fear of vengeance from the spirits concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the hunters acting out an event in the mythological creation of a certain kind of animal . Above all , the equilibrium of nature in which man participates must not be disturbed ; ceremonies symbolically maintain it , making it clear that for a man to kill a deer is a part of the normal course of natural events in the environment in which he lives . The world of the hunter can not be limited to the part of the farstretching landscape on which he pursues his game , to the members of his own group and those of his friends and enemies over the hills , the animals and plants that sustain his life , and the spirits of these animals and plants . It must also include the spirits of his own ancestors , who , though they are dead , are still in a sense alive . The length of time that the soul of a dead man survives depends on his importance to those who are still alive . If he was a fine hunter in his prime , the leader of the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quarrels , the teacher of boys , and a good husband , his death will cause a disturbance in the life of the band which will bring his image often to mind among most of its members . Tle is certainly finite and close at hand : he can be prayed to , invoked , asked for decisions in matters like those which he was accustomed to settle .  | The Social and Intellectual Life of Late Ice Age Hunters ioi If he was an indifferent hunter , a poor husband , and a quarrelsome person , his soul will be dim , and before many years have passed people will forget about him . His soul will have disappeared . After many years have passed and no one still lives who has actually seen the great man whose soul was large after death , his exploits gradually become merged with those of still greater heroes of the past , whose name his own may supplant . Gradually the invisible world becomes peopled with a stable cast . These are the men and women who made the landscape , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; some of them symbolize areas of disturbance between men and women , young and old , people and nature . Of the last , of course , the chief ones are the weather ; storms may be caused by the anger of some great spirit unwittingly annoyed by human beings who have done something that disturbs the relationships within the group . One great solace in the face of disturbance is art . Luckily the great art of Upper Paleolithic men has been preserved in the caves of France , Spain , and Italy by a constant temperature and humidity . The cave paintings made with mineral pigments and the outlines engraved with burins stand out among the finest works of art of all time . The perfect treatment of animal bodies indicates that  | HUMAN FIGURE FROM A CAVE ON MONTE PELLEGRINO , SICILY . the painters , who were consummate draftsmen , knew intimately the anatomy of the animals they depicted . They must have dissected dozens of such animals in detail before they began to paint them , just as Leonardo dissected human bodies for his artistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure are inaccurate and sketchy , showing a lack of interest in human anatomy ; but a complicated scene recently recovered in a Sicilian cave * contains many beautifully drawn human figures . footnote 6 Alberto C. Blanc , " Finest Paleolithic Drawing of the Human FIgure , etc. , " Migrated London News , Vol. 223 , No. 5963 , London , August 1 , 1953 , pp. 187-9.  | A well-drawn French cave painting shows a hunter dressed in an antler disguise . Psychologists and critics have read into this work of art all sorts of sinister meanings . To an anthropologist familiar with primitive hunting techniques this is just a man ready to hunt deer . Perhaps he is practicing . Perhaps he is trying to induce the spirit of the forest that controls the deer to make a fat buck walk his way , but to my way of thinking there is nothing more sinister in it than a picture of an American jet pilot putting on his electrically heated stratosphere suit before taking off . Whatever the artist 's overt motive in painting it , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express himself , as every artist does , whether he is painting a bison on the wall of a cave or a mural in the main hall of a bank . Ice Age Institutions I N place of the word group , which has a general meaning , sociologists use the more technical term institution in a special sense . The institutions to which a person in any culture may belong are the family , the economic institution , the political institution , the religious institution , the educational institution , and associations . Because the narrative thread of this book is an account of the way in which human beings have unwittingly increased the size and complexity of their institutions through their increasing control of the forces of nature and their growing technical skill , we must make sure that the meaning of the term is understood . If you go to church once in a while and are not a member , you do not belong to a religious institution . That particular religious institution is composed of a number of members who attend regularly and respond in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , the men who work in a factory regularly and obey the orders of their employer belong to an economic institution . If they are union men , they also belong to an association . Unless you are both a bachelor and an orphan , you belong to a family . Unlike hunting techniques , institutions leave no easily detected archeological remains , but only a few hints here and there . Much  | deduction , combined with the evidence of the social systems of living hunters , helps us trace them . According to our reconstruction , the Late Ice Age family was a closely knit body , as is nearly always the case . It covered two , and sometimes three , generations , but rarely more . It was in itself an economic institution in that it produced its own food , clothing , implements , and shelter . The band was a sovereign state , informally led by an outstanding hunter , who may also have been a man of good judgment , though the older men as a group probably steered decisions . They themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created so much disturbance that he interfered with the normal functioning of social processes , the old men would get together one night to do away with him . The state also took over economic functions : the best hunter or the older men distributed the meat among families and saw that no one starved . The educational institution was pooled between the family and the band . A baby 's earliest teaching came from its mother , older sisters , and other girls of the older sister 's age group ; as the child grew older , it played with others of its age , and then the boy began going hunting with his father , the girl continuing to gather with her mother . At puberty the band took over education completely . Boys were isolated in a group , where the older men put them through a series of impressive ordeals , including in many cases mutilation . We know this because silhouettes of hands from which certain fingers had been amputated have been left on the walls of French caves , and in Algeria and Germany skulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper median incisor teeth knocked out . Finger-chopping and tooth-knocking are common puberty-school mutilations among living primitive peoples . By such jolts to the nervous system and by fasting and keeping vigils , it was not hard for a boy to reach a physiological state where visions are easily seen , particularly if the boy is told to look for them . The appearance of masked men acting out the roles of ancestors or other spirits impressed him deeply . This heavy hazing was accompanied by a series of dramatic lectures on the proper behavior expected of adult men toward women , toward children ,  | toward their elders , and toward the world of animals , plants , and spirits . The curriculum included every contingency likely to occur in the lifetime of the boys going through it . As this school could be held only in times of relative abundance and inactivity , several bands would participate in it at their annual meetings , and the boys who had been through it together would consider themselves classmates in the future . Thus the educational institution sometimes exceeded the bounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where students from a dozen countries may attend an American university . For reasons stated in the last chapter , I believe that these bush schools go back to Lower Paleolithic cultures . The Late Ice Age religious institution likewise exceeded political boundaries , as it should in any healthy society . Ancestral heroes who hovered over the band were shared by other bands that met at ceremonial times . Cult heroes responsible for the landscape and its animal life were likewise shared , as were the combined capacities of the old men teaching the young . Religion is the sum total of behavior concerned with restoring equilibrium to the individual or the group after disturbance . Every person is disturbed at one time or another , either by his own illness or by that of a spouse or child , and this disturbance must be reduced to its lowest possible level for the well-being of the group . Reducing or allaying disturbance requires the utmost human skill . A person possessing such skill is of the greatest value to the group . It can only be acquired by concentration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start . Healing ? the Oldest Profession THE RELIGIOUS practitioner , the shaman , was the first specialist . His profession , not prostitution , is the oldest . There can be little doubt that shamans existed in Late Pleistocene times , for they have been found among all living hunting peoples , even including the recently extinct Tasmanians . A shaman is usually a man , though sometimes women who have passed the age of childbearing take over these functions . As a  | boy he is different from his companions . Dreamy , crotchety , illadjusted , he may fall ill about the time when he is supposed to show his prowess as a hunter ; during these illnesses he has attracted the attention of shamans , who recognize a recruit in him . Instead of , or in addition to , the regular course of higher education which the other boys go through , the novice receives special treatment from the specialists , who hide him out in some retreat of their own . Here he does much dreaming , and dreams are taken as seriously by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among the Ona , who are about as legitimate representatives of Upper Paleolithic man as can be found , we are told that the shamans magically eviscerated the novice and replaced his innards with some fluffy soul-stuff like goose down . This formed a comfortable lodging place for spirits when the shaman was possessed . What actually happened will probably never be known . Of one thing , however , we may be sure . The shaman learned a physiological control of some of his body functions normally considered automatic . Like a youthful Yogi , he was shown ways to produce states of inspiration through controlled-breathing exercises . Whirling dances and repetition of phrases combined to  | change temperature levels and to produce trance . Professors who lecture for an hour at a time to audiences of three hundred or more students in warm rooms , shouting to make themselves heard , sometimes hyperventilate themselves and say things that they had no intention of revealing . In our eagerness to know everything about the physical world from apes to atoms , we have neglected one aspect of science which requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Primitive men , lacking laboratories and instruments , studied it exhaustively . Sober eyewitnesses have given us factual accounts of some of the startling performances of shamans . In his inimitable account of his early life with the Ona , Lucas Bridges 5 describes the actions of a shaman named Houshken . Bridges asked Houshken to demonstrate his powers . " Houshken did not refuse my request , but answered modestly that he was disinclined , the Ona way of saying that he might do it by and by . " After allowing a quarter of an hour to elapse , Houshken said he was thirsty and went down to the nearby stream for a drink . It was a bright moonlight night and the snow on the ground helped to make the scene of the exhibition we were about to witness as light as day . On his return , Houshken sat down and broke into a monotonous chant , which went on until suddenly he put his hands to his mouth . When he brought them away , they were palms downward and some inches apart . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thickness of a leather bootlace , was now held loosely in his hands . It passed over his thumbs , under the palms of his half closed hands , and was looped over his little fingers so that about three inches of end hung down from each hand . The strip appeared to be not more than eighteen inches long . " Without pulling the strip tight , Houshken now began to shake his hands violently , gradually bringing them farther apart , until the strip , with the two ends still showing , was about four feet long . He then called his brother , Chashkil , who took the end from his footnote 6 Lucas Bridges , Uttermost Part of the Earth , E. P. Dutton &; Co. , New York , and Hodder &; Stoughton , London , 1949 . Quotations from pp. 263-4 , 284-8 , with permission from both publishers .  | right hand and stepped back with it . From four feet , the strip now grew out of Houshken 's left hand to double that length . Then as Chashkil stepped forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to take the other end from his brother . With the continued agitation of his hands , the strip got shorter and shorter . Suddenly , when his hands were almost together , he clapped them to his mouth , uttered a prolonged shriek , then held out his hands to us , palms upward and empty . " Even an ostrich could not have swallowed those eight feet of hide at one gulp without visible effort . Where else the coil could have gone to I do not profess to know . It could not have gone up Houshken 's sleeve , for he had dropped his robe when the performance began . There were between twenty and thirty men present , but only eight or nine were Houshken 's people . The rest were far from being friends of the performer and all had been watching intently . Had they detected some simple trick the great medicine man would have lost his influence ; they would no longer have believed in any of his magic . " The demonstration was not yet over . Houshken stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chant and seemed to go into a trance , possessed by some spirit not his own . Drawing himself up to his full height , he took a step toward me and let his robe , his only garment , fall to the ground . He put his hands to his mouth with a most impressive gesture and brought them away again with fists clenched and thumbs close together . He held them up to the height of my eyes , and when they were less than two feet from my face , slowly drew them apart . I saw that there was now a small , almost opaque object between them . It was about an inch in diameter in the middle and tapered away into his hands . It might have been a piece of semi-transparent dough or elastic , but whatever it was it seemed to be alive , revolving at great speed , while Houshken , apparently from muscular tension , was trembling violently . " The moonlight was bright enough to read by as I gazed at this strange object . Houshken brought his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until , when some three inches separated his hands , I realized that it was not there  | any more . It did not break or burst like a bubble ; it simply disappeared , having been visible to me for less than five seconds . Houshken made no sudden movement , but slowly opened his hands and turned them over for my inspection . They looked clean and dry . He was stark naked and there was no confederate beside him . I glanced down at the snow , and , in spite of his stoicism , Houshken could not resist a chuckle , for nothing was to be seen there . " The others had crowded round us and , as the object disappeared , there was a frightened gasp from some of them . Houshken reassured them with the remark : " Do not let it trouble you . I shall call it back to myself again . ' " The natives believed this to be an incredibly malignant spirit belonging to , or possibly part of , the shaman from whom it emanated . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or be totally invisible . It had the power to introduce insects , tiny mice , mud , sharp flints , or even a jelly fish or baby octopus , into the anatomy of those who had incurred its master 's displeasure . I have seen a strong man shudder involuntarily at the thought of this horror and its evil potentialities . " Lucas Bridges was a man of extraordinary detachment , and a splendid reporter . What he saw he could not explain . It is clear that Houshken had to work himself up into some kind of ecstasy to perform these tricks . How he did them is not clear , nor is it important for the purposes of this book . The fact remains that he was able to make the Ona among his audience believe in his supernatural powers . By means of them , in their opinion , he could cause disease among his enemies and cure it among his friends . This reputation made his life both easier and harder . He had to exert himself less in the food quest , for others fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention . At the same time his life was in constant danger . Illness and ill-fortune might be attributed to him , and he could easily be killed . As Bridges specifically states : " Frequently the chief object of a raiding party , in the perpetual clan warfare of the Ona , was to kill the medicine man of an opposing group . " At one time Bridges let two shamans and the wife of one of  | them try to prepare him for initiation into their profession . " My inception took place by a small fire , with the usual shelter of guanaco skins spread on the windward side . After giving me a harangue on the serious nature of my undertaking , Tininisk suggested that I should strip . I did as instructed , and remained half reclining on my clothing and some guanaco skins while he went over my chest with his hands and mouth as intently as any doctor with his stethoscope ; moving in the prescribed manner from place to place , pausing to listen here and there . He also gazed intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an X-ray manipulator . " Then , the two men dropping their robes and Leluwhachin her cape though retaining her female inner garment , they literally put their heads ? and hands ? together and produced something that I could see . It might have been the lightest grey down teased out into the shape of a woolly dog about four inches long , with a stout body and prick ears . With the trembling of their hands and possibly their breathing , they gave its movements a semblance of life . I noticed a peculiar scent that seemed to accompany this object as , with three pairs of hands held together , they brought it to my chest with many guttural sounds . I did not feel the pressure of the thing against my body , but without any sudden movement it was no longer in their hands . " This performance was repeated three times and , though each time a new puppy was supposed to be put in my body , I felt only the touch of the magicians ' hands . " Now came a solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if I felt anything moving in my heart ; or if I could see something strange in my mind , something like a dream ; or if I felt any inclination to chant . The truthful answer was an unequivocal No , ' but I put my denial as mildly as possible ... . No , I would not become a shaman , to be blamed , maybe , for a fatal heart attack a hundred miles away . " Had Mr. Bridges been an Ona , he might well have believed that these fluffy objects had entered his body . He might have felt something stir within him , and he might have been inclined to chant . He would then have been able to practice as a healer , in the following manner : " Standing or kneeling beside the patient ,  | gazing intently at the spot where the pain was situated , the doctor would allow a look of horror to come over his face . Evidently he could see something invisible to the rest of us . His approach might be slow or he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caused the trouble would escape . With his hands he would try to gather the malign presence into one part of the patient 's body ? generally the chest ? where he would then apply his mouth and suck violently . Sometimes this struggle went on for an hour , to be repeated later . At other times the shaman would draw away from his patient with the pretense of holding something in his mouth with his hands . Then , always facing away from the encampment , he would take his hands from his mouth gripping them tightly together , and , with a guttural shout difficult to describe and impossible to spell , fling this invisible object to the ground and stamp fiercely upon it . Occasionally a little mud , some flint or even a tiny , very young mouse might be produced as the cause of the patient 's indisposition . " Lucas Bridges was the son of Thomas Bridges , missionary to the Indians of Tierra del Fuego . Lucas spent most of his life on the island . While his father had concentrated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the south of the island , Lucas moved north into Ona territory , where he established a sheep ranch and employed many of the hunters . Had it not been for an epidemic of measles which nearly wiped them out in 1924 , he probably would have succeeded in leading several thousands of Upper Paleolithic hunters over a fifteenthousand-year cultural transition into the Industrial Age . Today a few dozen of them live in shacks near Lake Navarin , and Lucas Bridges has died . In all of the literature of anthropology I have failed to find a clearer , more circumstantial account of the activities of a Stone Age shaman than his . The shaman , being the first specialist to arise , was an all-purpose expert in human relations . He cured the sick as much as it is possible for human beings to be cured by suggestion , massage , sucking , and phlebotomy . He raised the morale of his own group by his invisible warfare with the enemy . In case of calamity he provided a convenient scapegoat , and above  | all he furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as a Christian priest believes in the wine and wafers that he uses in Communion . From the shaman is descended a long line of specialists , including priests , diagnosticians , surgeons , teachers , and scholars . A good priest , a good doctor , a good teacher , or a good scholar has to be a bit of a showman to do his work properly . At the same time he has to believe in the sanctity of his mission . Those readers who , like myself , are somewhat on the shaman side will understand this . The Hunter Needs No Hobby O N E fact about the life of a hunter which all who have lived among such people have noticed is that hunting is fun . Hunters take pleasure in their work . Human beings have been hunters for a long time , and our physiology is adjusted to this kind of life . As E. J. Faris 6 has shown , a man is at his best from the standpoint of fertility if he is away from home a night or two at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulate . Hunting gives him just these little absences . Hunting exercises the whole body , as few other occupations do . It places a premium on keen eyesight . Farsightedness is an asset . As we grow older , we tend to grow fartherrather than nearer-sighted . Hunting develops the muscles and tissue of his hands properly , instead of deforming and thickening them as farming and unskilled labor may do . It also places a premium on the capacity to make quick decisions , to act quickly , and to work in teams . Obedience and leadership can be developed in no better school . Courage is also a necessary component , and that peculiarly human thing , the willingness of a man to die in order to save the other members of his group . Man is a creature fashioned around and selected for hunting . Wealthy men who can pick and choose their ways of spending their days like to hunt . The Persians gave us the word paradise , which originally meant simply a hunting preserve . A good hunter footnote 6 E. J. Faris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Press , White Plains , N.Y. , 1950.  | is always on the alert , always ready to take advantage of unexpected circumstances . He is constantly seeking for new things . In our society , the men who find fun in their work and need no hobbies or vacations are the scientists and research men , including the archaeologists and anthropologists , who have carried the hunting spirit into new fields .  | pair of white dots on the map of Europe and had disappeared . Farther south and east , in the lands bordering the southern end of the Caspian Sea and probably elsewhere , the third phase of history had begun as Neolithic men had started to till fields , herd domestic animals , and live in villages . During the Neolithic ( New Stone ) and the following ages of phase three of history , man invented many new occupations for which the body of a hunter is not primarily suited . His hands became calloused and gnarled with plowing and with handling tools at the craftsman 's bench , or soft and stained with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent his days working on a stool , and his eyes strained as he focused his vision on small objects of wood , clay , or metal which he fashioned with his hands . Culture now took precedence over biology as the chief guide to man 's activities . The chain of discoveries and inventions which he then made was to increase many times over the population of the earth , his speed of travel , and his range of communication until technology had reached its present global limits . Because his specialized technical work involves the synchronized co-operation and the management of vast numbers of persons , man incidentally and unwittingly converts thermal , mechanical , and electronic energy into social structure . The institutions that he created grew in numbers , size , and complexity of detail , until the world came to be enmeshed in a living framework of interlocking organizations of prodigious complexity . It became an intiieate , pulsating pattern The Third Phase of History BY 6000 B.C. the Scandinavian ice sheet had melted to a  | held together by modern techniques of communication . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be reached by a single voice , so modern institutions can include the people who can see and hear world personalities by radio , television , and the press . Here too man 's expenditure of energy in building and operating communication machinery has been converted into social structure . Although it lasted only eight thousand years , the third phase of history included eight distinct ages comparable to the Paleolithic and Mesolithic . These were the Neolithic , Bronze , Iron , Gunpowder , Coke , Oil , Hydroelectric , and First Atomic ages . So much more intricate was the third phase than the first two that many times more space is needed to describe it , even in outline . That will take the rest of this book . The Nature of the Neolithic SHORTLY before 6000 B.C. the world 's climate had reached what is called a post-glacial optimum , a little warmer than at present . In certain parts of the world favored with abundant rainfall and rich animal and vegetable life , men had begun to settle down . Those who lived on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish and fowl to eat in season as well as the flesh of animals . By paddling and poling bark or log canoes they could transport heavy loads of foodstuffs , skins , and processed materials . Village life , for at least part of the year , became possible . So did wealth . In the old days when a man could own only what he could carry on his body as he followed his hunting path from camp to camp , strength , skill , and wisdom had been all that he needed for a successful existence . Some men were leaders , others followers , but the range of variation ! : n material possessions was small . Only qualities of personality and character gave men distinction . Once wealth could be stored from season to season , human life entered a new dimension . Another basis for distinction had arisen . The capitalist will say that this gave the gifted man his chance for  | progress that could benefit all men in the end ; the socialist that it led to exploitation of the masses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in turn widened the opportunities of people from different villages and regions to get together . When all men were Mesolithic hunters , as most of them still were when the Neolithic was young , human beings differed from the rest of the animal community in which they lived in no conspicuous way that an objective visitor from another planet could have detected at once . They had altered the landscape on which they hunted no more than most other animals had ? and far less than beavers , bees , and earthworms . The coincidence of campfires with the presence of man might have given the visitor a clue , and the yapping of dogs at his approach could have caused him to remark that here was an example of parasitism , or symbiosis , like that between ants and aphids , and this would have obscured his judgment , for the partnership of man and dog was less material than spiritual . Still , the spears , bows , and knives that men had learned to fashion were really nothing more than demountable substitutes for the fangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to all practical purposes , from a cosmic viewpoint , nature was still in balance . That terrestrial skin-cancer , man , had not yet passed from the latent to the virulent stage . He had not yet felled the earth 's forests , caused its soils to wash away , fouled the mouths of its rivers with his cities , or threatened the planet 's death with his atomic devices . Man first began to disturb the earth 's surface when he made his third conquest of natural forces , by learning to cultivate plants and to breed animals in captivity . It is reasonable to suppose that for a long time before this Mesolithic hunters , fishermen , and fowlers who lived seasonally in villages had made pets of baby animals and nursed them to maturity , only to eat them or to turn them loose when it came time to move . These same food-gatherers must have observed that food plants grow luxuriantly in refuse heaps where the seeds and pits and tops are thrown , and these unwittingly sown crops must have been eaten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and observations until man had devised  | some means to clear the forest and to build pens and folds . He needed to clear the forest to plant crops in the rich , loose loam between the stumps , and he needed pens to keep his animals from being eaten by wolves and from running away . Both forest-clearing and pen-building require a good woodworking tool . Such a tool was the polished-stone ax . When he got it , he began the life of a tiller and herdsman , a way of life which the majority of mankind still follows , and which forms the basis of our own existence . Wheat , beef , pork , milk , beans , pottery , weaving , wool , beer , and wine came to man as part of this cultural pattern , which is known as the Neolithic stage of human culture . Just as the burin had been man 's first passport to America , so the polished-stone ax was his key to the life of a farmer . Between the two devices , burin and ax , a logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Upper Paleolithic man roughed out weapons of antler by gouging and scraping . Then he finished their surfaces by grinding and polishing . Mesolithic man , who was more concerned with woodworking , used the same technique to produce staghorn chisels and wedges . Once he had transferred this method to hard , tough stone , he made an ax , and the Neolithic could , under the right circumstances in a few favored parts of the world , begin . The best of these early axes , which are made of jade , will cut like steel . Pecking , grinding , and polishing them was tedious work . Although it may have taken a month to make one , it would last a long time if carefully handled . At first man did not need to cut down all of the trees in his plantation , for if he ringed the bark they would die , and he could fell and burn them later . The rich soil , deposited between the trunks by the decay of vegetation , would give him a fine crop , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another patch . When all of the land within easy walking distance of his village had come into use , the community could divide , and some of its members found a new village elsewhere . The houses of these villages were built , not of logs and planks , but of pole frames with the walls filled in with wattle and daub . Wattling is simply a basketry technique transferred to housebuilding . You set up a series of poles , an inch or two in thickness ,  | along the line of the wall , planting their butts in the ground and lashing their tops to the framework . Then you use finer rods of some flexible wood like willow cut green in the spring , weaving them in and out horizontally between the uprights to make a basketry surface . When all of these surfaces have been finished , you smear wet clay on the walls , inside and out , and your house is enclosed . The roof frame you make of poles and withes also , and then you thatch it with bundles of straw from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as you can find in use in many countries today . The inner shrine of Glastonbury Cathedral , preserved for centuries because according to local tradition Christ once lived in it , was such a house . When the thatch catches fire and the house burns down , the heat will bake some of the clay , turning it hard , leaving it like soft stone . Farmers who have learned the properties of clay from house-building and have seen the baked lumps that are left after a fire , and who need good waterproof and fireproof containers , can go on to the next logical invention : pottery . The heat of an ordinary cooking fire will bake clay hard enough for simple domestic procedures , including the boiling of food . Now his wife could make porridge and soup , economical foods which made it easy to wean children , and which old people with toothless gums could swallow . As long as old women 's fingers remained nimble and their eyes unfogged , they could sit in the sun outside the house in fine  | weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaving it on simple upright looms . Thus the wool of the farmer 's sheep , sheared with a flint blade , could be turned into cloth . Squares of cloth were useful not only for garments , but as standard articles of exchange , and hence of wealth . While the man was outside with his ax and his animals , his womenfolk could make pottery and weave between the times of planting and harvesting , when all hands were needed in the fields . Thus Neolithic man extended the hunter 's division of labor between the sexes . To the duties of bringing in animal food and of tool-making , the men had added the crafts of hewing wood and carpentry . In place of her daily walkabout , the woman substituted both work in the fields and the skills of the potter and weaver . The carpenter 's task included setting up wattled fences to protect his fields from the inroads of wild animals , and others to keep his animals from straying . As a flock of goats can ruin a crop in a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the hunting days , when hunters would hesitate to chase a wounded animal across a tribal boundary for fear of a retaliatory arrow . In Neolithic times boundaries needed more than marking . They had to be fenced , and fencing requires hard work with ax and stakes and hammer-stones and withes . Robert Frost 's immortal line , " Good fences make good neighbors , " was just as true in Neolithic times as it has been ever since . This Neolithic pattern , out of which modern civilization arose , was dependent on the simultaneous exploitation of both animal and vegetable species , each being dependent on the other . Animals provide protein foods , skins , hair or wool for textiles , and milk . They likewise can be loaded with burdens , and their dung fertilizes fields . Vegetable products provide starches , sugars , oils , and some proteins as well , along with fibers and fodder for the animals in the seasons when grazing is poor or impeded by snow . The herding and care of domestic animals and their protection against predatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter to herder is a natural transition . The cultivation of gardens is an equally direct sequel to the woman 's search for wild vegetable foods . Thus in this new pattern each sex  | was able to make a parallel and separate transition from an old job to a new one , and the relations between men and women remained substantially unchanged . A little later , when men learned to plow with oxen , they took over the heavier work of agriculture , leaving women more time for such home industries as potterymaking and weaving . During the critical stations of the agricultural calendar , such as harvest time , men , women , and children would work in the fields together . Meanwhile , as men took over agricultural tasks , the care of flocks was given to boys or to professional shepherds . This mixed animal and vegetable economy was not , however , the only agricultural system invented in the world . In some centers , women began to cultivate gardens , while no animals , aside from the dog , were tamed . In North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf of Mexico to the St. Lawrence grew a variety of vegetables , including maize , beans , and squash , which gave them a balanced vegetable diet . Most of the work was done by women . The men for the most part carried on their ancient profession of hunting , going off on long seasonal trips after game ; but to them the meat was less important than the need for a well-organized , athletic , and masculine activity . With their particular kind of land-utilization , concentrated on the banks of streams and lakes , overpopulation was a problem , and so was the question of giving the men something to do outside the hunting season . In these societies there arose an elaborate system of games which kept the peace between neighboring villages , and an equally elaborate system of seasonal warfare based on the lifting of scalps ; and both games and warfare were highly ceremonial , furnishing a framework for the preservation of order in masculine society . In Melanesia , another Neolithic culture that has persisted until modern times , the same development occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate on herding without horticulture . The Middle East and central Asia are full of various kinds of nomads who pasture their animals on deserts , mountain valleys , and steppes , but all of these live by trade with farmers , and thus are part of a complex utiliza-  | tion of a varied landscape , one of which we have no record before the ages of metal . All of these adjustments are interesting to the student of history because they show how versatile human beings can be in adapting themselves economically to different environments . While each has contributed something to our modem world civilization , particularly in the form of special species of plants and animals , like the citrus fruits , maize , tobacco , the turkey , and the camel , it was not through them that the main line of history passed . In the countries in which the Neolithic of the Old World began , progress was rapid . Before the dawn of the earliest age of metal , Neolithic craftsmen equipped with polished-stone tools had learned to adze out large dugout canoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had probably also invented the plow and the ox-drawn sled . Masons with stone hammers had learned to quarry and move huge stones and to set them up in walls and monuments that remain as engineering marvels to this day . The size of building stones follows the law of least effort : with the inefficient tools available to Neolithic stonecutters , it was easier to move a stone of ten tons ' weight than to cut it into ten pieces of one ton each , and to smooth more than twice as much surface area . From Neolithic times until the present moment , most of the food that men have eaten was the product of fields and flocks ; most of his clothing was made of wool , the fibers of domestic plants , and leather tanned from the skins of herd animals . Most houses are still of wood , clay , and stone ; most kitchenware is of pottery . Despite the growth of cities and the rise of kingdoms and empires and leagues of nations , most of the people of the world still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These tasks are essentially the preparation of fields , planting and harvesting of crops , daily care of animals , and household duties concerned with the preservation and processing of foodstuffs and of animal and vegetable by-products such as wool and flax . In countries where seasons are marked , activities are seasonal . In some of the daily tasks the people of the village work separately  | as families , but in those which occur seasonally and concern all , the entire community works together , as , for example , in housebuilding bees , held in slack seasons of field work . Because the farmer is much concerned about the weather ? a storm may ruin a crop ? rain priests and wind priests arose beside the healers . Each village was likely to acquire a local spirit or god , which looked after the special interests of its inhabitants in times of crisis . Local , autonomous priests were absorbed into greater hierarchies . A priest provided comfort and strength to the villagers at such critical moments as marriages and deaths , and helped in quarrels between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum because of the unequal distribution of natural resources over the landscape . One village might have a good supply of ax stone , another of clay , and another of iron oxide needed for red pigment . The easiest way to distribute these materials was through trade . Trade could go on only when there was peace . Hence villages within an economically unified area would form some kind of alliance , held together by periodic markets , ceremonies , and games , directly derived from the seasonal meetings of hunters . Such , in brief , is the Neolithic way of life . It has survived not only in the upper reaches of the Amazon basin and the interior mountains of New Guinea , where garden-cultivators still fell trees with stone axes , but over a great part of the so-called civilized world . An airplane passenger flying over the cultivated regions of most of Europe , Asia , and Africa will see the landscape divided up into groups of fields within walking distance of the nucleus of each cluster . This nucleus is a village in which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very place and brought up together pass their lives in a common effort to make their crops grow and their animals prosper and multiply . The pattern of human relations which arose from these efforts may still be seen in many countries , including France , Italy , Iran , India , Ethiopia , and Mexico , where the rise of cities merely created a division of labor between rural and urban communities . Only two large nations have seriously upset it . In America , Yankee inventors of the last two centuries manufactured agricul-  | tural machinery to use on new land unencumbered by villages . Thus the airplane traveler flying across the continent will see a landscape laid out in a grid of squares so accurately marked that the pilot can set his course by it , and in these squares are individual farms as mechanized as factories . The farmers , by using laborsaving machinery , are able to send their children to high school and college . Because farming requires as much education as business or a profession , and because the modern farmer can commute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , the old distinctions between village rustic and urban sophisticate have been obliterated . Twentieth-century America has lost the Neolithic culture pattern because it never carried it beyond the eastern seaboard , which has become industrial . In Canada , New Zealand , Australia , and Argentina , European peoples have also taken over land not already devoted to mixed village farming . They have followed the American pattern , with improvements of their own . The other large nation that has tried mechanization is Russia . There , however , the land was already occupied by Neolithic-style villagers , who could not be forced out of their ancient way of life without a severe jolt . Their leaders used the supreme power of the state to uproot them and to cram them into collective farms , on which they are supposed to imitate the American techniques of mass agriculture with machinery . As they own neither their land nor their machinery , and have no choice in the education of their offspring , these peasants lack even the limited incentives of individual enterprise which they had before . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet been crowned with success . One wonders how the transition will be made in Europe , India , and China . Although the Neolithic began three thousand years before writing , and five and a half thousand before the birth of Herodotus , the " father of history , " Neolithic culture is much more than a subject of inquiry by prehistorians . Moving out of it may be the world 's most difficult problem .  | ONE clue to the origin of Neolithic culture , in which farming was so important , is the discovery of the origin of various cultivated plants , particularly through an identification of their wild prototypes . Botanists have gone on many expeditions to central Asia , Ethiopia , and other supposed focal points to look for wild wheats , ryes , beans , and fruit trees , and to see what relationship these have to our common varieties . The object of these searches is not only scientific knowledge , but also plant-improvement through hybridization and selection . Plant-improvement involves not only the size and taste of a fruit or seed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of soil and climate , ease of sowing , weeding , harvesting , immunity from insect pests , and suitability for processing and storage . These very qualities without doubt influenced the choice of the first farmers as to which plants to cultivate and which ones to continue picking wild . All the basic plant species of Neolithic agriculture , such as wheat , barley , flax , and beans , grow best in midlatitude regions where seasonal change is marked and where everything ripens in a period of a few months . This made storage necessary , and hence the plants chosen for cultivation were those which would keep best when stored . The first farmers were probably people who had begun to collect and store their staples long before they thought of growing them ? for instance , the Indians whom the white settlers found living in central California villages . The Indians gathered acorns , pinon nuts , and wild grass seeds in season and put them away in basketry containers to eat through the winter . When the Forty-niners cut down a huge oak tree in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the oak was a sacred symbol of food and prosperity , just as it had been two thousand years earlier in Greece . Central California has what the geographers call a Mediterranean climate : its pattern of annual temperature and rainfall is similar to that of the lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea . Its wild products are similar to those of ancient , pre-agricultural  | Greece , Lebanon , and Palestine , and parts of Iraq , Iran , and Turkestan , lands in which the Neolithic civilization reached far back into antiquity . The Mesolithic inhabitants of these lands must have stored acorns , nuts , and seeds in the same fashion as the Californians , to last them through the winter . Some of them still eat acorns . In the springtime the womenfolk of these ancient gatherers must have waded along the stream banks gathering watercress and have walked bent-backed through the meadows searching for edible greens , just as Italian women used to comb the suburban lawns of America for dandelions . Through the summer and into the fall they could make excursions to dig up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good not only for flavoring but also against worms . These leaf crops , root crops , and bulb crops could also be cultivated , and many of them were . But they did not , in the times of which we have record , assume the same importance as the crops that could be easily stored and thus preserved in bulk through the hungry winter . The plants that formed the backbone of agriculture in the parts of the Old World from which our own civilization is derived were all of a kind in size , shape , condition , and ways of handling . Wheat and barley , the small grains , furnished predominantly starches . Broad beans , peas , and lentils furnished proteins . Sesame , flax , and hemp furnished oil . Most of them had additional uses : flax and hemp as fibers , wheat and barley as straw for thatching houses and bedding down cattle , and the legumes for adding nitrogen to the soil . All of them come in the form of grains or seeds that can be dried and stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last several years if enough is planted at once , but they can also be used as seed after a number of years , should the crops fail in the meantime . Therefore they are eminently suited for cultivation in regions of fickle rainfall , on the southeastern edge of the westerly storm belt , where rain falls only in the winter months . Being annuals , they all can be sown broadcast , a time- and labor-saving technique . All can be reaped in bulk rather than as individual plants , and the seeds can be removed from the stalks by threshing  | or flailing . All of them can be made into food either by boiling into porridges or by grinding and baking . Suitability for reaping is not a feature of wild plants . When a head of wild grain ripens , it opens and the seeds cast themselves on the ground . When a wild pea plant matures , its pods burst open and its seeds scatter . Were this not true , the plants would commit suicide . Human beings gathering such seeds have to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the right time to make the seeds fall into baskets . The amount of seed that an individual can gather in a season , before it becomes trampled , rots , or has been collected by birds and squirrels , is small . Now and then a wild plant puts forth a suicidal mutation in which its head or pod lacks the ability to open . Ordinarily such a plant eventually falls and its seed rots . However , if a human being gathers it and opens its head or pod artificially , he can sow the seed next season , and the mutation survives . Its survival permits him to take his time gathering the crop . The grainfield will stand until he has reaped the heads , handful by handful , even if it takes him more than a month . Then he can spend several months more separating the grain from the straw and chaff , and the loses very little .  | It is hard to imagine that hunters and gatherers accidentally stumbled at a single time upon both grain and pod plants , each having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and providing among them a balanced vegetable diet as well as materials for housing and clothing . The ancestors of our early farmers must have passed through a long period of trial and error during which agriculture was only a part-time occupation , and during which many other botanical species were grown and discarded . Among the discards were probably certain plants that have followed the cultivated species around the world as weeds . Others that started as weeds became cultivated plants . Of these last the best-known example is rye . Rye began as a weed growing amid soft wheat , and the mutation of non-shattering heads appeared in it as it had in wheat . Owing to the similarity in size and shape of the two grains , farmers had trouble separating them , if indeed they tried . Probably they did not : today conservative farmers in Pakistan and elsewhere habitually sow several kinds of grain together . In regions of mild winters , wheat formed the bulk of the crop . However , during a particularly cold winter the rye would survive while most of the wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . The next spring 's crop would be predominantly rye . When people carried the mixed seed northward and up the slopes of mountains , rye pushed out wheat . That is why you see a line crossing the map of Russia marking off the wheatlands to the south from the ryelands to the north , and why the Rifpians of northern Morocco grow rye in the high mountain valleys and wheat on the rolling plains . In the same way , oats started as a weed in emmer , another kind of wheat , and eventually reached the windy headlands of the Scottish Highlands as a separate crop . For a long time the existence of the rye-wheat boundary dividing his realm bothered Stalin , who liked to homogenize his territory . He ordered Professor Vavilov , then the president of the Russian Academy of Sciences , and the very man who had discovered the origin of rye , to produce a hardy variety of wheat which would grow on the ryelands . Vavilov , the world 's most eminent plant geneticist , explained that this would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it could be done at all , would take many years . Stalin ordered it done in two years . Vavilov , of course , failed and disappeared . As far as his fellow botanists know , he is dead . His place was taken by Lysenko , who has repudiated the gene theory of heredity as a capitalist concoction , and has produced a theory of his own to explain inheritance and evolution , one which satisfies his bosses but no one else . Were this book being written in Russia , it would be easy ? in fact , necessary ? to state definitely exactly where agriculture began . As it is being written in America , we can afford to have differences of opinion , and to be vague where exact knowledge is lacking . At the moment we can be reasonably sure that the small grain-legume-oil seed plants were first used in combination somewhere in a broad band of terrain reaching eastward from Anatolia to Pakistan , and southward from the deserts of Turkestan to those of Arabia . We can be reasonably sure because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within this general zone , human beings also began to cultivate , as part of the same agricultural complex , a number of fruit trees and vines that are still to be seen in our orchards and vineyards . One of these , the rose tribe , has produced rose hips , hawthorne haws , apples , pears , and quinces , all of which are eaten in various places , though hips and haws are seldom seen on Western menus . Wild pears and wild apples still grow as forest trees on the western slopes of the Zagros Mountains in Iran . Another succulent tribe , which reached China before it did Europe , began in Turkestan : that of the almonds , peaches , plums , and apricots . From the same northern portion of the ancient agricultural belt came the walnut and the vine . The latter has been more specifically pinpointed to Transcaucasia , meaning Georgia and Armenia . Olives and figs , native to the Mediterranean countries , were first cultivated in Palestine or Lebanon , and dates are first known from the swampy lands bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been mentioned fit into the pattern of early western Neolithic agriculture in the sense that all of them can lw processed and preserved . This is the essential difference between the kind of agriculture that  | gave rise to our own Western civilization and the old tropical gardening of southeastern Asia and Oceania , in which most foods had to be eaten when ready . In the Middle East and in Europe , sliced apples can be strung and dried ; grapes , split apricots , figs , dates , almonds , and walnuts are dried and kept for winter rations . Olives are pressed , and the oil will keep in jugs . Grapes and apples are pressed , and the fermented products ? wine and cider ? will keep in skins or pottery containers , to gladden many a dreary winter evening . Pears can also be converted into a beverage , perry . Many fruit trees have hard wood , and all but the fibrous palm are fine-grained . The reason for this is simple . Each year each tree , if its owner is lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its superstructure as the fruit swells and ripens . Sometimes the branches break , but the trunk holds . Wood that can bear such a load has to be strong and flexible . It is far better than most forest woods for the fashioning of plows , wagon wheels , rakes , spade handles , and all other agricultural implements , and that is what Neolithic man probably used it for . In a primitive agricultural community , as among mountain Riffians today , every olive tree and every walnut tree is watched carefully ; when its production has fallen off to a certain level , it is turned into plow handles , just as old pear trunks , in America , find their way into woodcarvers ' studios . The Animals Enter the Barnyard NEOLITHIC agriculture , with its balance of starch grains , oil seeds , protein-providing legumes , and oil- and sugar-producing fruits , would never have carried us farther along the path of civilization than the point reached by the Pueblo Indians , had it not been for the other half of the complex , the domestication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goat , the sheep , the ox , and the pig . Concerning the origins of these animals , experts are as much at odds as they are in the case of cultivated plants . All four are members of the so-called Palearctie or northern fauna , which  | stretches across the northern temperate zone of the Old World from Britain to China . Within this range , goats , sheep , oxen , and pigs are or have been present in a number of wild forms , and the question arises : which wild form gave rise to which domesticated species ? We archeologists are interested in this question because we know that if we can identify the wild ancestor of each of the domestic animals , we can tell not only where each domestication began , but also whether it started in several places independently , or in one alone . Once we have this information , we can tie it to the evidence for the origins of cultivated plants , and then we can see if the Neolithic economic system started as a whole or resulted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them arose out of the other . The origin of our own civilization is what we are therefore seeking . The likeliest candidate for the title of grandfather of the goats is the so-called bezoar-goat of Turkestan and Afghanistan . The winner of the sheep contest seems to be the argal , a wild sheep of the Elburz Mountains in northern Iran . However , more than one species of wild sheep and more than a single kind of wild goat may have been involved . Sheep and goat coincide geographically with wheat , which is a help in our search , but matters become more complicated when we study the history of the ox . All humpless breeds are thought to be descended from Bos primigenius , the huge , fiery-tempered longhorn depicted alike on Spanish cave walls and in Minoan murals , the animal whose ceremonial death in Spanish bull rings perpetuates an ancient sacrifice . Bos primigenius was a native of the plains from southern Russia to the Altai Mountains , including the Caspian shores and Turkestan . It is a far cry from this majestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones in archeological sites and by survivors in the Orkneys and Shetlands . The early domestic type , Bos brachyceros , was a dwarf . If it was descended from Bos primigenius , as we believe , then the question arises : did early farmers catch and tame the huge and powerful full-sized animal and select dwarfs from its descendants , or did they find some dwarfs in the forest and tame them ? Berthold  | Klatt , who is professor of zoology at Hamburg , and the world 's greatest authority on the origins of domestic animals , says that they found dwarfs already formed in the wild state . His reason is convincing . In all domestic animals dwarfed by man , the teeth remain large , as in a bulldog or Pekinese . Wild dwarfs have small teeth to fit their bones . Without reasonable doubt , two wild species sired the domestic pig . One is Sus scrofa , the common wild boar that ranges all the way from western Europe and North Africa to central Asia and Siberia ; the other is Sus vittatus , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet known in the world are those which my expedition recovered from the Neolithic levels of Belt and Hotu caves on the Caspian shore of Iran . They are stored on shelves in my office in Philadelphia . They belonged , quite clearly , to the species Sus scrofa . So did the pig bones removed from the mud under Swiss lake dwellings excavated over one hundred years ago.l These are also Neolithic , but a good two thousand years later footnote On page 37 of his Agricultural Origins and Dispersals , American Geographical Series No. 2 , New York , 1952 , Carl O. Sauer states that the Swiss Neolithic pigs were vittatus , on the basis of a statement on page 85 of B. Klatt 's Entstehung der llaustiere , Berlin , 1927 . The original reads : " Die alters europaischen , jetzt dutch Einkrc uzung nicht mehr reinen Lanclschweinrassen stammen von Sus SCROFA , die cingeborcnen asiatischen Ilausschwelne , die seit viele Jahrzehnten zu dieser Einkrcuzung herangezogen sind , stammen von Sus vrrrATrus . " My translation is :  | in date . However , the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of pork and lard , bear little resemblance to wild boars . With their short snouts and rotund bodies they are clearly related to the ancient pigs of southeastern Asia and China . What has happened is that pig-breeders of the western world have substituted the far-eastern species for their own . If we did not know this by other means , we could find it out by a study of pig lice . The lice which infest modern European and American swine are the same as those which live on the hides of both domestic and wild specimens in Siam . The wild-boar lice are different . This business of tracing relationships between animal species by louse-detection is a new and interesting field of science , based on the discovery that lice are as conservative as they are obnoxious . The environment of a louse consists of a curved patch of skin , in which he crawls about in the shelter of hairs or feathers , at a more or less constant temperature and humidity . During his wanderings he encounters other lice of the opposite sex , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When his host dies , he scrambles out into the cold world to seek a precisely similar environment on the cuticle of another individual . When a mammalian host gives birth to offspring , he finds it possible , in the excitement of parturition , to infest the hapless suckling . In the case of birds , he leaps from the mother 's sheltering wing onto the fledgling 's plumage . When his host too enjoys the pleasures of mating , the louse can skip from one lover to another , and if the hosts are hybridizing , he can hybridize as well . During all of this activity , over thousands and even millions of years , the environment of a louse may not change at all , though that of his host may be greatly altered . His host may develop long legs , short jaws , and fewer or lesser teeth , while , owing to the constancy of his environment , the louse remains the same . In this way entomologists not long ago solved an ornithological mystery , the origin of the flamingo . Flamingos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not a crane at all . footnote " The old European domestic pig races , no longer pure because of mixture , are descended from Sus scrota ; the native Asiatic domestic pigs , which many decades ago were drawn into this hybridization , are descended from Sus vtttatus. "  | Crane lice are quite different . It is on this basis that the modern breeds of swine have been traced to the pig of southeastern Asia . No one knows how the first herdsmen caught their first animals , but this has not prevented a host of authors from speculating . Two facts are available which may offer some clues . One is that among living primitive peoples it is a common habit to keep the young of animals after the mother has been killed , to nurse it like a baby , and to fondle and pet it . Another is that some men and women , even today , have the power to make animals come to them . A thorough knowledge of animal habits and animal communication is one of the qualifications of a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully grown , had been caught and kept in captivity long before people had the facilities to feed them around the seasons and to protect them when kept in flocks and herds . If , as Klatt has stated , and as my own study of the oldest Neolithic bones tends to confirm , the first domestic animals were dwarfs , then the problem of how the animals were handled becomes simpler . Wherever they came from , and however they were caught , the goat , the sheep , the pig , and the ox form a working combination as well suited to one another as are grains , legumes , and oil seeds , which they in turn complement . A goat is a hardy animal which can browse off land that will support no other beast besides the camel . It provides meat , milk , and a good strong skin suitable for use as a container for liquids . Its hair is glossy and waterproof , making a good fabric for tents and all-weather capes . The goat , furthermore , serves as a guide and protector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dog . The sheep itself yields wool , ' prime material for clothing , as well as milk . Certain varieties of sheep have been perfected for meat , others for their fat tails , still others for the delicate wool of their newborn lambs . The sheep can be fed nearly anywhere , as long as there is grass , either green or dry . As long as there is no serious danger from wolves , lions , and tigers , one man and a dog can take care of a mixed herd of one hundred sheep and goats . The pig is hard to skin , can not be milked , and yields nothing but bristles . Yet its tusks can be used for knives as well as for orna-  | ments . Its principal virtues are its habit of producing large litters of offspring at frequent intervals and its capacity for rapid growth . Thus it is a meat-producer par excellence . Furthermore , it can be fed on acorns and beech mast in forested glades where it roots for truffles , leaving the parkland and meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to drive pigs easily or how to make them respond to calls or other signals ; one swineherd can handle but a few animals . Unlike his three companions , the domestic ox is large enough to carry burdens , including tents and household furniture , men , women , children , puppies , lambs , and kids , on its back . It can also be hitched to summer sleds like those still in use on the Caspian shore of Iran , in the Caucasus , and in the Basque country , and to plows , harrows , and wheeled vehicles . It can be milked , and its milk will separate naturally into cream and skimmed milk . Cream can be churned , or shaken in a bag , into butter . Cowhide is strong , and useful for implement straps , thongs , and even shields and armor . Cowhorn may be carved into spoons , and made into drinking cups . Furthermore , the food products obtained from the ox can be easily processed for storage , along with the grain , beans , and oils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk can be converted into cheese by the addition of rennet , a substance taken from the stomach of a suckling calf , and cheese can be hung from the rafters along with flitches of bacon and belly meat , hams and sausages . Smoking and drying will convert most parts of the slaughtered animals into food that can be kept through the winter . The advantage of preserving meat over slaughtering when needed is clear ; the butchering season is the fall , after the animals have been suitably fattened and before the ordeal of the winter , when fodder is scarce and when the flocks must be kept as small as possible . Hence it is the young males that are killed off , and the pregnant ewes and nannies that are kept , along with a few particularly potent rams and billy goats . Following the same principle , datefarmers in Iraq , Egypt , and Morocco cut down all but a few of the male trees , which produce no fruit , and fertilize the female trees by hand with pollen carefully removed from the studs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug up in caves in France and elsewhere , bones representing the meals of ancient hunters , have observed that nearly all animals killed were full-grown . Where a Neolithic deposit overlies such a layer , an immediate change is seen . At least half the bones are those of lambs , kids , and other immature animals . Wherever we find such a transition , we know that domestication , from that point on , in that particular place , has begun . To locate this turning point as well as simply to tell what kinds of animals surrounded the bones , we pack the specimens carefully at the site , and after we are home we clean them , harden them in a plastic solution , and number them so that we can shuffle them without fear of losing track of the level in which each specimen was found . Then we sort them by parts of the body , from horn to hoof , and after that by species . In the case of sheep and goats , many bones have to be left in the double category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horns and jaws , are distinguishable . By examining the jaws and teeth we can soon discover how many of each species were killed while still carrying their milk teeth , and how many were spared until after the eruption of their permanent dentition . In the case of sheep , goats , and pigs , at least fifty per cent were killed before dental maturity in every domestic series studied . In the case of the ox this is not true because the young animals were preserved into maturity as beasts of burden or traction . In the cases of wild animals such as gazelles and deer , almost all specimens were adult when killed . Man Toys with the Forces of Nature W H o L L Y aside from getting new sources of food and more of it , and from building up village life as the characteristic pattern of human society , man started , in the Neolithic , his practice of toying with the forces of nature . First of all , he cut and burned down forests that had been standing for thousands of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in places where the rainfall was marginal or fickle , starting the whole process of soil  | erosion which has wasted vast areas of the earth 's surface , causing them to resemble scar tissue on the skin of a living body . Playing favorites with some plant and animal species over others , he made them dependent on him for their very survival , for he destroyed their power of procreation or successful living if left on their own . Thus he upset the whole balance of nature by thwarting the forces of natural selection . We have been doing this ever since . Such fruits as apples , pomegranates , pears , and figs are twenty times as big as their wild prototypes . Grains and legumes have lost their capacity to shatter on ripening and have been made completely dependent on man for survival , like many of the domestic animals . The conversion of the sheep into a walking and bleating woolfactory is one of our ancestors ' most dramatic perversions of nature , and so is the selection of cattle for huge udders and great quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which includes the horns and skin as well as the hair and milk glands . If an animal has been selected for wool , milk , or both , it can not be expected to have the long , sweeping horns of its wild ancestors , for all of this body tissue is fed from a single source . Long horns were no longer needed once the animal came to live in the protection of men and dogs . For the same reason , the domestic pig fails to grow the dangerous tusks of his forest-rooting kin . Changes in the size and form of horns and teeth had already begun in the bones found in archeological remains , though the horns and teeth of these earliest domestic animals were as yet nearer to the wild type than to the modern forms . Several domestic animals have developed stunted forms , with short , twisted legs and low-slung bodies , like the bulldog , dachshund , the Peruvian ( Indian ) pug , the short-legged sheep , and many others . In many breeds the tail has grown short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all domestic animals are small and spongy , with a high fat content , and we can tell simply by the feel of a bone whether it belonged to a domestic or a wild animal . Domestic animals also have short , thin extremities and abundant body fat . This , of course , is the result of selection for meat , made possible by the fact that under human care rapid motion is no  | longer necessary for survival . Some human beings also have small hands and feet , and tend to obesity . According to the insurance companies , this is the type of person that dies young . Longevity is of no consequence in herd animals : they are ordinarily slaughtered in a youthful state . In nearly all species of animals and birds that have been domesticated , both the muzzle and the skull have grown shorter than those of the wild forms . The muzzle is short because man prepares the animal 's food for him , reducing the work of teeth and jaws , which then grow small . In this change , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by protecting the animals from natural enemies and bad weather , man has made unnecessary the full development of the animal 's senses , and those parts of the brain in which the messages from eyes , ears , and nostrils are received lie fore and aft in the brain . Lack of use prevents the full development of these portions of the gray matter , and thus the brain and the skull that encloses it are both shortened . These changes can take place in a single generation , as experiments performed in Germany have shown . There a zoologist caught a pair of wild foxes and placed them in a zoo . After the vixen had littered and the young had begun to grow up , he released some of them , and they in turn produced young . Having caught and killed members of all three generations , he weighed their brains . The members of the original wild generation had fifty-gram brains , the generation born and reared in captivity thirty-five , and the second wild generation fifty . This is believed to prove that changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensory areas are not inherited , at least over a single generation . In the case of animals that have been sheltered and led to pasture and back by man for eight thousand years , one wonders . Reversions have taken place , as with the razorback hogs of the Appalachians and the wild goats of Catalina Island . But how closely do these resemble their distant wild ancestors , and how many of the liberated animals died without offspring in the process ? One of the most conspicuous changes that come over animals once they have been tamed is that their coat-color pattern grows gayer . In the wild form this is rigidly uniform for each species , as  | a result of natural selection . An albino deer has little chance of living to the age of reproduction in a forest environment in which every move is conspicuous . Yet albino sheep and piebald cattle and goats can live to ripe old ages if their herdsmen so choose . A good instance of deliberate color selection is familiar to all Bible readers , in Genesis 30 : 31-43 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel , Jacob agreed to tend the flocks of his father-inlaw , Laban , for a number of years . However , Laban agreed to give Jacob , at the end of his service , all of the black and brown sheep and the striped and spotted goats . The reason for this selection was probably to make it easier for each man to tell his own animals from the other 's . Today in Middle Eastern villages where all of the animals are herded together , one man will try to own only brown sheep , others only white ones , and so on , to make separation easier and reduce disputes . Jacob , however , had another motive . He cut a number of sticks from the side of the stream and peeled them in rings and dots . Having placed these sticks in the water , he brought the goats to that place to drink , in the hope that the quality of being striped and spotted would be transferred from the sticks to the offspring of the goats through the agency of the water . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic , like the belief that eating fish will make one brainy because fish and brain tissue look somewhat alike . Jacob was not trying to improve the breed of goats by this ruse , and it is unlikely that Neolithic man , who lived several thousand years before Jacob , knew about selective breeding either . It is quite possible , however , that features in animals , such as stripes , spots , and white fleeces , for which Neolithic man may have selected his animals on magical grounds or for purposes of identification , were linked hereditarily to others which did actually produce improvements in an economic sense , as , for example , heavier fleeces , more milk , or fatter tails . In the vegetable kingdom , it is quite possible that melons and squashes were first grown as rattles or containers , and then for edible seeds ; many wild forms have bitter fruit to keep animals from eating them . Only when sweet-fruited mutations arose did they become edible . Like non-shattering plants and those that have lost their ability  | to produce seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sensory perception can be compared to the loss of locomotion among certain insects . In the shelter of its host 's fires , folds , spears , and bows , they have lost their fear of predators . Lacking man 's intelligence , they do not know that inevitable slaughter awaits them . Hence the sheep bleats hopefully , the cow lows at the pressure of full udders , and the goat maas . Begging for food , water , milking , and a return to the fold is more profitable than silence . Yet this alteration of nature did not all come at once , and the Neolithic must have begun without the barnyard noises that had become familiar by the time of the first poets of whom we have record . The Earliest Farmers ? the Archxological Evidence THESE generalizations about the origins of the Neolithic , in reference to both plant and animal forms , are not being made on the basis of modern distributions or deductions from later sources such as the Bible . They are based on the discovery of actual plant and animal remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , as far as we know today , was the original home of Neolithic agriculture and animal husbandry . They are the product of the excavation of about twenty sites , including both caves and mounds , in Turkey , Lebanon , Palestine , Iraq , Iran , Russian Turkestan , Afghanistan , and Pakistan . From this material we derive our only factual knowledge of the first great step , after the mastery of fire , in our story of man . Some of these sites , like Byblos in Lebanon , are really city sites in which only the persistence of the excavators led them to reach the Neolithic foundations . Others , like Tepe Hissar in Iran , are primarily Neolithic settlement mounds with Bronze Age and later materials on top . A few , like Jarmo in northern Iraq , excavated by Robert Braidwood , and my Belt Cave , show a continuity from Mesolithic deposits right up into the earliest Neolithic , and on into later sequences . One of them , the upper levels of the same Mount Carmel caves that yielded advanced forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an otherwise pure Mesolithic culture with flint sickle blades . These flint sickle blades are shiny . All grasses contain silica in their stems . That is why the teeth of grass-eating animals are long , and grow out continuously during the animal 's adult life ; silica wears teeth down . It also polishes the surfaces of flint sickle blades used to cut it . Shiny sickle blades mean only one thing ? the cultivation of non-shattering cereals . Most archeologists , unaware of the botanical fact that wild cereals are never reaped , but are harvested with stick and basket , have taken the combination of Mesolithic implements , wild-animal bones , and shiny sickle blades to mean the reaping of wild cereal . It is highly unlikely that we will find evidence of the first cultivation of shattering cereals , for obvious reasons . We may be sure that wherever we find polished sickle blades , either grain had been grown for some time , or its cultivation had been recently imported from some earlier scene of development . Why should we have so few Neolithic sites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug by archeologists , is where the Neolithic began ? The answer is simple , if disturbing . The Middle East is the place of origin , not only of the Neolithic , but also of the great literate civilizations of the Bronze Age ? those of Egypt , Sumeria , Babylonia , and the Indus Valley . These great literate civilizations produced not only the earliest writing that has survived , but also recognizable works of art , like statues and basreliefs and much gold jewelry . Tablets , statues , and gold jewelry are expensive objects for which both private collectors and public museums will pay high prices . They command a thriving black market . Hence the archmologists who have excavated the sites from which such treasures are obtained are art experts rather than anthropologists . Their profession stemmed directly out of the classical archaeology of the nineteenth century , which in turn came from the study of classical literature . The attitude that only the best is worth bothering about has been carried over from the classical tradition . The Egyptologists and Mesopotamian excavators who have dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared  | and equipped to spend large sums , running into hundreds of thousands of dollars , on their excavations . Their job is to bring back what their trustees want . Neolithic objects are unimpressive . Stone axes , flint sickle blades , crumbly potsherds , and broken animal bones do not draw crowds to museums . When an old-fashioned Bronze Age archaeologist who works for an art museum gets , down to a Neolithic level , he stops . Even if he is personally interested in the origins of the civilizations which he has uncovered , he can not justify further work to his principals . Archeologists interested in the more ancient periods , who dig up things less valuable from the art point of view , are rarely supported by art museums . These men represent universities , which have less money to spend on digging , since they are working not for wealthy opera and art-museum patrons , but for the trustees of universities . Such archaeologists are more likely to be seen in a cave in New Mexico than in one in Iran or Afghanistan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now our trustees are beginning to be just as interested in the Neolithic , and in the Paleolithic as well , as in the Bronze Age , and support from the art type of institution is forthcoming for these activities . This is a splendid thing in another sense , as post-war restrictions on the export of ancient art objects from Middle Eastern countries have grown so great that the investment of large sums of money on the excavation of city mounds is no longer justified . If war leaves the Middle East alone for another decade , we may expect to know much more about Neolithic origins than we do at present . Most of the Neolithic sites that have been excavated consist of mounds . The traveler who has ridden over the road from Baghdad to Tehran has seen thousands of them . Some are still covered by buildings , while others , having grown too tall or too steep , shelter villages in their lee flanks . The presence of a village over thousands of years made such a mound . As adobe walls crumbled , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of it . The bottom level of such mounds usually contains pottery and flint sickle blades , as well as the bones of domestic animals . The village was founded by people who were already farmers . One such site , however , was occupied before its inhabitants  | knew the use of either flint sickles or pottery ; that is Jarmo , a mound near Kirkuk in northern Iraq , on the edge of the plain flanking the Zagros Mountains . The brilliant work of Robert Braidwood , of Chicago , who excavated it , shows a transition from Mesolithic to Neolithic habits of life . The earliest material in it , represented by a sample of snail shells , was given a carbon-14 date of 4758 B.C. , : 1- 320 years . This date is pre-ceramic . Although the people who lived there at that time had no pottery , they had begun to cultivate cereals and to breed sheep , goats , pigs , and cattle . Braidwood 's good fortune or good judgment can not often be repeated . In my opinion the best place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of mounds , but in caves . The earliest agriculturalists , particularly before they had begun to raise cereals , probably practiced slash-and-burn agriculture . After ringing the trees of a few acres of forest and allowing the wood to dry out , they would burn them and plant in the soil around the stumps . After a few years the underbrush would have become so dense that it would be easier to move on to a new spot . Even if the underbrush was kept under control with stone tools , at the cost of immense labor , the soil would soon be impoverished . Early farmers moved about from place to place , rarely remaining long enough at one site to produce a mound . The earliest agriculturalists were , after all , basically Mesolithic people , and Mesolithic people were cave-users where caves were available . Caves are fine places to shelter sheep during the winter , and the dung creates warmth . They are also good places in which to bury the dead . Once a fairly sedentary life has been adopted , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more persons , the number of deaths increases and the disposal of bodies becomes a problem . In some Neolithic sites in Europe they were buried under the floor . In France , Malta , and the Canary Islands they were stacked in caves . Because Neolithic peoples usually place objects with the dead to aid them in the afterworld , one finds in caves some splendid stone axes , flint tools , digging stick weights , and ornaments , still associated with the bodies with which they were placed . One also may find actual seeds and grains . Furthermore , potsherds and the bones of do-  | mestic animals pack the soil . Everything that one needs to study Neolithic life is here , except for the houses in which the people themselves lived . In 1949 and 1951 our expedition dug a site in northern Iran called Belt Cave , which contained a sequence of cultures ; at the bottom , dated at 9530 - ! - 550 B.C. , was a Mesolithic level with many seal bones and every evidence of a wet climate . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! - 380 B.C. , in which the gazelle was the dominant animal . After this came the beginning of the Neolithic , with domestic goats and sheep , but no pottery ; date , 5840 ? 330 B.C. Whether the people who inhabited the cave at that time cultivated wheat or barley , I do not know . At any rate , they kept sheep and goats , and killed off some of the lambs and kids every year ; for twenty-five per cent of the bones of the animals are those of babies . Somewhat later , at a date established at 5330 B.c. - ! - 260 years ( between 5070 B.C. and 5590 B.C. ) by carbon-14 analysis , they had begun to make pottery and to reap grain as well as to keep pigs and , a little later , cows . Not only because of these discoveries , but also because of its natural gifts and central location , the most likely place , at the moment , in which to look for the beginnings of tillage and animal husbandry is the narrow belt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Caspian Sea . There the soil is black and rich , the rainfall heavy , and the climate mild . Rarely does frost form or snow fall in winter . Wild fruits , including pomegranates , are abundant . The sea is full of fish , and eight thousand years ago many seals basked on its shore . Sturgeon annually swim up its streams to spawn their eggs , which are sold to the world as caviar . The brush is alive with pheasants and grouse ; the swampy lagoons along the shore contain many ducks and geese . Up on the forested mountainside are many red deer , boar , wild sheep , and mountain goats . In ancient times wild cattle grazed there as well . No other single place in the Middle East contains so many natural advantages for early tillers and herdsmen . Tillage and herding , however , may not have begun in one place . The Caspian shore lands may have served as a focus of assembly rather than a point of origin .  | Carbon ? l4 Dating 2 THE EXACT dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Libby , with the assistance of E. C. Anderson and J. R. Arnold , set up their laboratory in the University of Chicago as a part-time avocation . Specimens from Belt Cave , consisting of charred bone , were among the first that Dr. Libby studied . Since then he has dated hundreds of specimens sent him from all parts of the world , and other laboratories have been set up in Philadelphia , New York , New Haven , Ann Arbor , Copenhagen , and possibly elsewhere . In our own University Museum in Philadelphia one of Dr. Libby 's students , Elisabeth Ralph , is currently working on our Iranian cave samples . Carbon-14 dating is one of the benefits derived from research on atomic energy . It is based on the knowledge that " carbon dioxide is rendered radioactive by cosmic radiation . Since plants live off the carbon dioxide , all plants will be radioactive . Thus we conclude that all living things will be rendered radioactive by the cosmic radiation . " As long as an organism lives , its carbon retains the same amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has died , only distintegration takes place . The disintegration of the carbon-14 atoms in the dead organism proceeds at a fixed rate , which is " independent of the nature of the chemical compound in which the radioactive body resides and of the temperature , pressure and other physical characteristics of its environment . " To make a long story short , atomic physicists can date a piece of organic or organically formed material by measuring with Geiger counters the state of disintegration of its carbon-14 atoms . Up until 1952 they could go back to twenty thousand years before the present ; with improved apparatus they can now reach forty thousand years . The best material for dating is charcoal ; wood , basketry , ancient bread , seeds , and peat are equally good , but are less frequently preserved . The same is true of skin , horn , and other forms of animal epidermis . Bone can be used if it has been charred , footnote 2 W. F. Libby , Radiocarbon Dating , University of Chicago Press , Chicago , 1952 . Quotations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone and horn cores are useless so far . Since archaeologists began collecting bottles full of these datable materials for Dr. Libby , his laboratory has been so swamped with orders that he has been obliged to set up an archaeological priorities committee . Now that more laboratories are opening , he can spread the work , but the demands will likewise increase . Operating difficulties have grown also , slowing the process down . The medical use of carbon-14 makes the neighborhood of hospitals unsuitable for dating tests , for every time the wind blows from a hospital 's smokestack toward the laboratory , it throws the Geiger count off . Several times during the summer and fall of 1952 our laboratory had to stop operating , wait a week or two , and begin over again . The cause was free C-14 in the atmosphere , blown over from Nevada . If many more atomic bombs are set off , this method of dating may itself become outdated . Most of the samples on which , beset with these hazards , Miss Ralph is working come from a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred yards from the mouth of Belt Cave . After having received the Belt Cave dates from Dr. Libby , we went back to Iran , got check samples of charcoal from Belt , and excavated Hotu , a neighboring cave . Over the underlying gravels lay a thick Neolithic deposit that began with software pottery similar to that of Belt Cave , and with the bones of all four of the standard domestic animals , though the bones of pigs and cows were not common in the lowest half-meter , being greatly outnumbered by those of sheep and goats . As one goes upward in the Hotu deposit from the base of the Neolithic , one comes to a transition in the type of pottery . Some of the coarse vessels lower down were painted red with ochre and striped with black pigment in simple geometric designs . Then a new type of pottery appears , red with black designs , but thin-walled and hard-fired . People had apparently learned that if one uses fine clay and finely ground temper , it is possible to make a thin-walled vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary fire .  | Neolithic Migrations in the Old World I N the mounds of Iran , Iraq , Afghanistan , and Turkestan in which Neolithic settlements have been uncovered ( except for Jarmo ) , the earliest pottery found is this painted material , divided into two wares , red on buff and black on red . Much work has been done to trace the spread of these two styles . In general , the buff ware is centered in Iraq , and the red in Turkestan and the Iranian plateau , while the Pakistan sites have both . Of little importance in themselves , these types of pottery , decorated in some cases with attractive representations of the ibex , serve as tracers of early agricultural movements . But the results are not yet fully worked out to the satisfaction of everyone , it being a habit of archeologists for each to think that his site is the earliest . In any event , these painted pottery wares had developed and spread throughout the Middle East before the beginning of the age of metal ? that is , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffusion of Neolithic culture . Farmers who grew the conventional grains and bred the conventional animals crossed the Egyptian Delta to settle the fertile plains and valleys of North Africa , where an expedition of which I was a member dug their remains from caves in 1947 . These caves are located in the territory of Tangier , near the Strait of Gibraltar , directly under a Spanish bar , and overlooking one of the finest bathing beaches in the world . Seldom has an expedition worked under such conditions . The Neolithic people of North Africa concentrated on pigbreeding , which is not surprising in view of the heavy forests of oak which once covered the landscape . Their pottery was of the familiar soft type ; their flints were the conventional blades , their axes made of basalt . Their arrival at the Strait of Gibraltar is generally dated at about 3000 B.C. , on what evidence I am not certain . Personally I would favor a date at least six hundred years earlier . Some of them crossed the strait to Spain and eventually settled France and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the opposite Mediterranean shore , settled in Greece , Crete , and Italy . In the meanwhile other pioneers had moved  | around the Caspian Sea and along the northern shore of the Black Sea to the mouth of the Danube . Following the banks of this river and its tributaries , they eventually reached Germany , where they met the vanguard of the North African migration . The Danubians , as the northern branch is called , also made soft pottery and blackstone axes and adzes . Some of the Neolithic villages of Europe have been carefully excavated . As a rule they are located on low hills and surrounded by walls of logs set vertically in the ground . The houses were small and single-storied , made of wattled sticks smeared with clay , and the floors were of beaten clay . Apparently the people went out to their fields in the morning and returned at night within the protection of their ramparts , just as their descendants have been doing ever since . Probably a thousand years elapsed before painted pottery was carried into Europe over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 5400 B.C. in the Caspian lands , and painted wares to between 5000 and 4000 , then the rate of movement into western Europe was exceedingly slow . Compared with the Middle East , the Western world presented many barriers and challenges , of cold and snow , of wide rivers , and chilly mountains . It was a world of incomparably greater natural resources than the Middle East , harder to tame , but bearing greater promise for the future , a promise not evident even as late as the times of the Greeks and Romans . The eastern route out of the Caspian basin was even harder . Neolithic farmers , with the usual plants and animals , are believed to have entered China at a date slightly later than that of their arrival in Europe , for they had to cultivate , on the way , not river valleys filled with loess ( a fine , wind-deposited , easily worked soil ) , but desert oases , and a lofty continental divide had to be crossed . As the road to China was harder , fewer people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of the mountains they found a different climate . Early Neolithic agricultural plants are those which thrive on a cycle of winter rain and summer drought . In Europe , these conditions obtain along the Mediterranean , while elsewhere the even distribution of the rainfall throughout the year offered no barrier . But in northern China the winter is dry and  | winds off the Pacific bring summer rains . The imported plants could be grown only with difficulty . The answer was , of course , the domestication of local plants suited to local climatic conditions . Actually China is the world 's greatest center of plant domestication . Two of its economically most important species are rice and the soybean . Rice , which produces twenty times as much grain per acre as wheat , requires more hand labor , but less use of animals . However , it will feed large agricultural populations , so that in rice country , village follows village almost without interruption . There is no room between villages for shepherds to pasture their flocks . So many economic uses are there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for mats , and for fuel , that where rice is the staple there is hardly enough fodder for draft oxen , let alone for animals kept for milk or meat . An excellent vegetable substitute for milk and meat is provided by the soybean , rich in both fats and proteins . In the form of curd cakes , this is extensively eaten with rice . The Chinese long ago gave up milking animals , if they ever began , which is highly doubtful . The only animal that they breed especially for eating is the pig , a scavenger . Not only does it clean the village walks , but it also converts human excrement into meat . Pottery models from the Han dynasty , 100 B.C. to A.D. 100 , show privies built over pigpens . Water , which is good for rice , is also good for travel and transport . The Chinese long ago learned to carry their goods and their persons along rivers and to build canals ; the abundance of these natural waterways and their artificial supplements has made the use of domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water transport for animal transport had begun in the Neolithic is hard to discover , for the Neolithic sites in China which have been scientifically excavated number less than the fingers of a human hand . As in the Middle East , the abundance of art objects from later periods has obscured scientific inquiry . It would be extremely interesting to know just how the shift-over from a Caspian type of Neolithic to the Chinese type of agricultural life took place . Perhaps someday our children will be able to find this out . It will be particularly interesting to know whether the cultiva-  | tion of plants in central and southern China and in Indo-China really was introduced by Neolithic travelers arriving over the oases and mountains of central Asia , or began independently in local domestications , as some eminent botanists believe . Unfortunately almost all the early archeological sites of China are located in the north . It is possible that a local Neolithic , with polished-stone axes , black and mat-marked pottery , and with local food plants , as well as with the vittatus species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern China before the date of 2400 B.C. , the conventional starting point of the North Chinese Neolithic . Unfortunately there is no way of proving or disproving this theory . The best argument for it , aside from botanical reconstruction , is the carbon-14 date of 1530 ? 200 B.C. recently obtained from an early site on the island of Saipan in Micronesia . If agricultural people had reached the Marianas by that time , they must have left the Philippines somewhat earlier ; and if they had come to the Philippines from South China , as we presume , the nine hundred years that intervened between 2400 and 1500 B.C. is hardly enough time to account for all of the activities and events of their journey . Neolithic techniques of making polished-stone axes had to be diffused to South China , along with the domestic pig . Taro , yams , citrus fruits , and the mulberry had to be domesticated , along with the pandanus , a close relative of the litchi nut . Breadfruit , the banana , and the coconut had to be domesticated either on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fowl had to be tamed . People had to migrate in two main jumps : to Indonesia and thence to Micronesia . The evidence for a separate and indigenous South Chinese Neolithic is purely circumstantial , but it can not be dismissed with a wave of the hand . The question of Neolithic continuity will eventually be clarified when we have found enough Neolithic skeletons to trace the physical movements of this period . The oldest yet known may be the remains of half a dozen persons buried in the Belt Cave , a few scraps from Hotu , and a fragmentary skull that Robert Braidwood excavated at Jarmo . While no analysis of this material has been published , it is all in Philadelphia . The early Neolithic men that it represents were European in type . A group of skulls recently found  | in the pre-pottery layer of Jericho , in Palestine , confirms this . Faces had been modeled on these skulls in plaster , and the features painted on . These and other Neolithic skulls from central Europe , western Europe , and the Mediterrnaean countries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today among Nordics and Mediterraneans carried the earliest Neolithic culture westward from central Asia over various routes . But in the East ? What we still need to know about the Neolithic , physically and culturally , vastly exceeds our present knowledge . Neolithic sites , or Neolithic levels in composite sites , are not as exciting as the remains of Pleistocene man , or as rewarding to the treasure-hunter as those of the Bronze and Iron ages . But from the standpoint of the history of civilization , the Neolithic is very important . During the first phase of human history man became a hunter , and during the second he carried this skill to perfection , acquiring surpluses of food , a rudimentary division of labor , and some degree of settled life . Hundreds of generations of hunting selected him biologically into a special physiological pattern reflected in his behavior toward other persons . However much cultural needs may have modified human behavior , it is still an extension of physiology . When , some eight thousand years ago , the first farmers and herdsmen abandoned hunting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit them into the new requirements of village life , and that is a problem that most of the world still faces today .  | Neolithic habits of living have survived in modern Europe , India , China , South America , and other regions of high civilization . This does not mean that their inhabitants still cut wood with polished-stone tools , but that their village life retains a Neolithic pattern in its frame of mind . To find whole Neolithic cultures surviving into recent times we must trace the early migrations of food-producers to their final goals and see how Neolithic man filled in the gaps on the map unoccupied by earlier hunters . So efficient was Neolithic technology that by its means men conquered the treeless cold and sailed to new islands across distant seas . At the ends of the ancient earth we find them living in communities and kingdoms ranging in social complexity from that of the simplest band of hunters to that of the English of King Alfred 's day . From the start the third phase of human history gave man the means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the first three thousand years of Neolithic history , Neolithic culture-bearers finally reached the borders of cultivable land . In the northern forests of Europe and Asia they taught their techniques of tool-making to hunters , who could now build cabins , sleds , and elaborate traps . In place of cattle the forest people domesticated the reindeer for meat , skins , milk , and traction . Reindeer-breeding spread all the way from Lapland to Bering Strait , where the earliest Russian explorers found villages of people who lived by hunting sea mammals and by trading blubber , ivory , and seal and walrus skins to the reindeer-breeders in return for reindeer skins . The people in the interior needed sea-mammal hides for thongs and boots , and ivory for tools . The people who caught  | the sea mammals needed reindeer skins for clothing . Of the seashore villages , some seven were occupied by Eskimos , a people who had arisen on both sides of the Bering Sea , and who had spread eastward along the barren arctic shore of Alaska and Canada to Labrador and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore those territories . On the American side they hunted both sea mammals and caribou and hence obtained the two kinds of material that they needed . The Eskimos Occupy the Treeless Arctic Eskimo culture , with its variations from Alaska to Greenland , is without doubt the best known to Americans of all the " primitive " ways of life . The Eskimos live near the North Pole , build snow houses , wear warm clothing , hunt animals that look like reindeer , and drive fuzzy dogs attached to sleds . The Eskimos are closely identified with the Santa Claus myth . Because much of Eskimo culture is ingenious , mechanical , and healthy , it is a suitable subject of kindergarten study and furnishes out-of-door patterns for children 's play . To the children of America the Eskimos have come to symbolize winter , fun in the snow , Christmas trees , and the stamping of reindeer hoofs on the roof . Besides furnishing a subject of infant-indoctrination , the Eskimos are important in world history because they were the first people , as far as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely cold environment without firewood , and thus to occupy a previously uninhabited part of the earth 's surface.l On the Asiatic side of the Arctic the forests come close to the shore , but on the American side the tree line is too far inland to be within reach of seamammal hunters . They were able to survive because with Neolithic tools they carved lamps out of soapstone or made them of pottery , and boiled their food over lamps in kettles of the same materials , using blubber as fuel . Stone-carving , pottery-making , and boiling are Neolithic tech1 The discovery of implements of earlier type in parts of the Eskimo country may reflect the presence of men in an earlier and warmer period .  | niques . The burning of blubber may have been original with the Eskimo , or borrowed . Olive oil was used as fuel in the Middle East three thousand years before our earliest evidence of the existence of Eskimos , and the Turks and Mongols of central Asia have long burned butter ; this practice was carried to the Arctic shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned the oil of various seeds in their lamps , and both the Ainu and the Japanese use fish oil . Whether or not the Eskimos invented the use of blubber for cooking , heating , and illumination is academic ; the important thing is that they did use it . But a source of fuel was not enough ;  | good transport was essential for survival in their environment . Here again inventions that had been made in the Neolithic served them . Ground-stone knives and adzes made it possible for them to make the most of their slender supply of wood and to produce the frames of sleds and boats . Both sleds and frame-built boats were Neolithic devices elsewhere . So was the use of a team of animals for traction . Whether or not the Eskimos invented their sleds and boats and the idea of dragging both by means of dog teams is just as immaterial as the question of blubber-burning . Functionally , the point is that these were Neolithic inventions made possible by the use of Neolithic tools . These inventions , however , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eskimos had they not been able to make for each person , young and old , male and female , at least one perfectly tailored double-fur suit . This garment consists of twelve principal pieces : a parka complete with hood , a pair of trousers , and a pair each of mittens and boots , each in duplicate , so that the inner set covers the body with the hair in , the outer with the hair out . This is even more important for survival than the blubber lamp ; in these suits the Caribou Indians of the barren lands , who suffer from a scarcity of fuel in winter , can survive without heat in their snow houses if they eat enough fat . The essential feature of such a suit is skilled tailoring . The tailors are the women . In order to cut the furs in the exact patterns needed for each individual , the woman must have a good knife . This knife is the ulu , a semi-lunar ground-slate implement nearly identical with our saddler 's knife , which every skilled leatherworker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to the Eskimos ' ability to live in the barren Arctic , as important as the blubber lamp . The Eskimos were able to live happy and successful lives in the treeless Arctic not only because they knew how to make Neolithic tools , blubber lamps , kettles , and warm clothing , but because they were bright people who exercised the utmost economy , inventiveness , and skill in the use of the few natural materials and trade objects available to them . In Alaska a little iron came across from Siberia in trade . In Greenland they cold-ground  | hunks chipped off a huge lump of native iron , and in the Coronation Gulf country of northwestern Canada they treated native copper similarly . These metals were useful for tool-making , but the Eskimos were not dependent on them . When they had no metal , they fashioned flints into knives and harpoon points , slate into ulus and adzes , and soapstone into lamps and kettles . Their meager supply of driftwood served them for piecing out and patching the frames of boats and sleds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents , and boat-covers . Sinew was converted into sewing thread and cordage and the springy backing of bows ; intestines were worn in the form of raincoats and rainhats ; bone and ivory were carved into sled runners and the joints , toggles , and sockets of harpoons . Even snow was used for housebuilding , ice for windows . The mechanical principles that distinguished Eskimo culture were also known in the world 's centers of civilization at the time the Eskimos are known to have first used them . Therefore we can not be sure how many were invented on the spot and how many borrowed . One of these is the spring . An Eskimo hunter shapes a strip of baleen ( the whalebone of commerce , formerly used in corsets ) into a flat , double-ended skewer , then rolls it tightly and secures the roll . He freezes this into the center of a lump of fat and throws the fat out where it will be available to marauding wolves . The wolf sniffs it , swallows it , and departs . The fat melts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the toggle , used together with the ball-and-socket joint in harpooning . The Eskimos mount their harpoon heads on a bone or ivory foreshaft lashed into a socket fixed to the end of a wooden shaft . When the head has penetrated hide and blubber of seal or walrus , the impact of the strike frees the foreshaft in its ball-and-socket joint , and at the same time the head is pulled from the end of the foreshaft , remaining in the wound . When the line tightens , the head is turned at right angles to it , becoming an embedded toggle that will hold against any strain that the line will bear . The shaft floats free of breakage by the thrashing animal ( a great advantage in the Central Arctic , where wood is  | scarce ) , while the hunter draws the dead or exhausted animal to him on ice or shore . The combination of the toggle and the ball-and-socket facilitated seal-hunting , but a further invention was needed to make it possible to bring whales and large walruses ashore . That was the pulley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster an adventurous hunter in a boat would tie an ivory pulley-block . At the shore end the thongs would be passed through slots carved in the solid ice . A team of men , hauling on the thong , could warp the carcass ashore . Probably the best-known Eskimo invention is the snow dome , used as a regular house-building device only on the central Canadian coast . Elsewhere igloos are emergency houses only . Many youthful Americans who have failed in their attempts to build such houses may not have known that the Eskimo dome is made by setting tapered blocks in a spiral . Each block is sup-  | ported by the one to its lower side as well as those beneath it . When a small enough aperture has been produced at the top , it is capped by a single piece . This differs entirely in principle from the brick or stone dome of Iran , the other world center of domes , in that the Persian dome is based on a series of four arches covering the lip of a circular opening ; when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them , and so on until the top has been reached . Both the Eskimo and the Persian types can be built without temporary support . Even with the help of all of his ingenious devices , the Eskimo hunter is limited as to the number of seals he can harpoon and the number of fish he can catch . Food is scarce , and in most of the Eskimo country lying between Alaska and Greenland the number of people who can live in one village or camp must be limited to between fifty and eighty . In the winter two or three families , totaling about twenty-five persons , live in one house . In the summer each family lives in its own skin tent . Individual families are free to leave the community and join another . There is no formal chieftainship , though people are more likely to listen to a good hunter than to a poor one . Too much has been said about wife-swapping among the Eskimos . Like many other peoples in the world , an Eskimo host will offer the services of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often against the woman 's wishes . Members of the same household or camp do not frequently commit adultery with one another 's wives , for this would arouse the same kind of feelings there as elsewhere . Eskimo men kill one another for this . In the whaling days , ship 's masters used to set a cook ashore in an Eskimo village at the beginning of the season , with a stove and a barrel of molasses , to make rum . The reason was that a still will not work in a constantly moving vessel . At the end of the season , before the freeze-up , cook , stove , and rum would be taken back on board . At Point Hope in the 1930 's the Eskimo population was 250 . Of these , some 22 or nine per cent of the whole , were frizzlyhaired , the result of one Negro cook 's activities while making rum . Eskimo society is as simple as any in the world , simpler than that of many flint-using food-gatherers . Its simplicity is a function of the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strug-  | gle to keep alive . There is no division of labor other than that between the sexes , no elaborate kinship , no age grading , no formal political organization , and shamans are only part-time practitioners ; they too have to hunt to live . It is practically certain on archeological grounds that at one time or another the ancestors of these people had more to eat , and hence lived in larger communities , and that the requirements of living together made a more elaborate structure , remnants of which are still to be seen among the Eskimos of southern Alaska , where food and wood are more abundant than elsewhere . If any of us survive the next war and adjust ourselves to hardship and the simple life as well as the Eskimos have done , our social structure will have become simpler also . On theoretical grounds , it is of interest to examine the religious and cosmological beliefs of the Eskimos . Here is a people able to employ some of the most advanced mechanical principles invented by man . An Eskimo can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble ; nothing in our mechanical civilization seems to lie beyond his immediate mental capacity . Yet his explanation of the natural phenomena with which he is immediately concerned is of a simple order . Once upon a time a father was out fishing with two daughters , The girls fell overboard . As they reached for the gunwales , he cut off their fingers and dropped them into the sea ; from the joints came seals . The souls of the seals are controlled by an old woman named Sedna , who lives under the sea . When she chooses , she releases the souls of seals , which rise to the surface to be harpooned . When food is scarce , the members of the village or household believe that someone has done something to anger Sedna and to make her hold back the supply of seals . Much soul-searching takes place , with confession , until the cause of Sedna 's wrath has been determined and expiation made . The belief in Sedna is a mechanism that helps to restore equilibrium in a group of people after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary as the very techniques of hunting and keeping warm which the Eskimos employ . Its lack of sophistication is not remarkable ; most pr ( ? - literate and some literate peo-  | pies of the world place their faith in equal naivetes . What is important is that it makes no differentiation between kinds of people . The Eskimos have other gods and spirits , but all of them symbolize , like Sedna , some aspect of the weather or of hunting , affecting all persons alike . This set of beliefs and the practices that go with it are as simple as the society they serve . The simplicity or complexity of a religious system has nothing to do with intelligence , but is dependent on the relative complexity of societies , as another example will presently show us . The Neolithic Island Paradise of Hawaii D E S P I T E the possession of Neolithic tools , sled dogs , and boats with sails , the Eskimos lived within the confines of a social system as simple as any known , because food was scarce , communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of their energy was needed to keep warm . In contrast the Polynesians , who also had Neolithic tools , dogs , and sailboats , developed a social system as complex as many of those of medieval Europe because food was abundant , island communities were large and close together , and the climate was warm . S'l ' ( ) NI AUY1 : FROM IIAVAII.  | At some time in the not-so-distant past the ancestors of the Polynesians sailed out to their islands in large double-ships hewn from logs with Neolithic tools . These ships were manned by huge crews . With square and crabclaw-shaped sails they rode before the wind , and when it was necessary to move upwind they paddled . Lacking the single outrigger ships with asymmetrical hulls in which modern Micronesians sail close to the wind , they got where the wanted to go by sheer muscular effort . HAWAIIAN DOUBLE SHIP . Dogs howled , pigs grunted , and cocks crowed on these seagoing barnyards laden with coconuts to supply life-sustaining fluid . On them the wives of mariners clutched sweet-potato tubers under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would sprout in gardens yet to be made on islands still undiscovered . On low-lying islands , where no hard stone could be found to replace the imported tools that had been broken , Polynesian craftsmen ground axes and adzes out of the shell of the tridacna , a giant clam . In ignorance of pottery , which could have been made on some islands but not on others , they made fine containers of gourds , wood , and coconut shells . In place of weaving they hammered tapa cloth out of the tender bark of mulberry and pandanus , trees that they had brought with them . With the same ingenuity as shown by the Eskimo , they worked out a way of life eminently suited to their new environment . The route or routes that the ancestors of the Polynesians took to sail to their islands is/are unknown . Many eminent scientists  | have speculated on this problem and come up with different theoretical reconstructions . The conventional and older opinion is that they sailed out of Indonesia , by way of Micronesia , to a rallying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tonga ; thence they dispersed northward to the Hawaiian Islands , eastward to the Marquesas and Easter Island , and southwestward to New Zealand . A more recent opinion , which has not yet had time for critical evaluation , is that they came out of the coast of South China , from the region of Canton and Hainan Island , sailing to the Philippines and thence to Micronesia , and from there eventually to Polynesia as previously stated . A carbon-14 date of 1530 - ! - 200 B.C. from Saipan brings the seafarers to Micronesia at a time when the Chinese people were beginning to expand from their home in North China into central and southern China , and when the nonChinese Neolithic inhabitants of these regions were beginning to feel the push . Some went later to Siam as Thais . Others invaded Indonesia . The current opinion is that the invasion of Indonesia took place via Hainan and the Philippines , and thence southward around the island chain to Sumatra , rather than via the Malay Peninsula as previously postulated . This hypothesis , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , as the Malay Peninsula is essentially a refuge area . In any case , the settling of the outer Polynesian islands was not old . The oldest archeological level in Hawaii is dated at A.D. 1004 ? 180 years . A third opinion , dramatized by the voyage of the Kon-Tiki in 1947 , and sponsored by Thor Heyerdahl , is that the Polynesians came , in several waves , from America . This we will deal with later , when we come to discuss the origins of American Indian civilization . For present purposes Polynesian origins are less important than the fact that the Polynesians maintained a highly organized Neolithic culture up until modern times , late enough so that anthropologists have been able to study it in detail . This culture was naturally most complex in the larger islands or groups of islands where tropical plants could be readily cultivated . Such a group was that of Hawaii . On the 17th of January , 1779 , when General Washington was  | waiting out the winter at Morristown , New Jersey , a British subject named James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hawaiian group , dropped anchor in Karakakooa Bay in the largest island , Hawaii . Having visited Tahiti , New Zealand , and other parts of Polynesia previously , and indeed having several Polynesian members in his crew , the famous mariner was surprised only at the size of the island and the numbers of persons who came out to his three ships in their canoes . Theirs was the greater surprise . Never before had the people of Hawaii seen European vessels or European faces . It happened that the time of Captain Cook 's arrival fell at the climax of an annual four-month period of feasting , sports , and religious worship , and was sacred to the high god Kane . At this time the king 's emissaries circumambulated the island , collecting taxes . With them they carried a large rectangular sheet of white tapa cloth suspended from a cross bar at the head of a pole , in turn surmounted by a small wooden idol . Seeing the ships from afar , the Hawaiians remarked the close resemblance between their sails and the Makahiki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain Cook 's arrival fitted a prophecy . When he went ashore , people fell on their faces before him as he walked to the royal enclosure for an audience with the high king of the island . Although he did not know it then , later accounts explain that he was mistaken for a returning deity . Despite this identification , the Hawaiians felt no compunction against stealing from the ships all objects of metal on which they could lay their hands , and their thievery was matched only by their generosity in furnishing pigs , taro , and other foods to the ships ' crews . On the morning of February 14th it was found that during the night they had made off with the cutter of the Discovery , and Captain Cook himself went in pursuit . In the rather complex sequence of events which followed , the king lost control of the huge mob of people who had assembled , and Captain Cook was killed by means of an iron dagger that he himself had brought to the islands for trade . Twenty-four days later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambassador to France , issued from his residence at Pussy an open letter to all American shipmasters ,  | bidding them spare and aid Captain Cook and his fleet , despite their nationality , calling Captain Cook 's mission " an undertaking truly laudable in itself , as the increase of geographical knowledge facilitates the communication between distant nations , in the exchange of useful products and manufactures , and the extension of arts , whereby the common enjoyments of human life are multiplied and augmented , and science of other kinds increased , to the benefit of mankind in general . . . . " When this letter of Dr. Franklin 's reached Congress , the orders contained in it were instantly reversed . By then Captain Cook , in the form of a few dismembered bones , was safely under the sea a few miles off the island of Hawaii . Despite the enormous distances that separated them , the islands of Polynesia supported a culture which was more or less the same everywhere , except that in New Zealand certain modifications had taken place to allow for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , more isolated islands , the cultural pattern was perforce simpler than on the larger ones , such as the Hawaiian and Marquesan and New Zealand groups , or the closely packed archipelagoes in which individual islands could be visited by short voyages in canoes . Among such archipelagoes the Society Islands ( Tahiti ) , Samoa , and Tonga , each with its dependencies , were most notable . In each of the larger islands or island clusters , the people lived in family groups of from twenty to forty persons , in hamlets set in the midst of extensive gardens , where a minimum of work produced a maximum of food . Sweet potatoes , taro , yams , breadfruit , pandanus , bananas , and coconuts were staples , with the paper mulberry providing the finest bark for tapa cloth . Pigs , dogs , and hens provided food for feasts and sacrifices , while a more abundant source of proteins was found in the fish that the islanders caught , by hooks or nets , in the lagoons and the open sea , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was enough food to provide a surplus and to support a large body of specialists , the number of persons whom each island could support was limited . The population was kept down by techniques of birth control , including abortion ; by warfare , by human sacri-  | fice , and , in certain but not in all islands , by cannibalism . In earlier times , during the period of exploration and settlement , emigration was of course an obvious means . When white men discovered them , each island of moderate size was a separate kingdom . Some of the larger islands , such as Upolo in Samoa , supported three self-governing districts , in this case loosely united under the authority of the paramount king of all Samoa . Kingdoms were small because each district produced most of the products its people needed and because Neolithic techniques of transport , communication , and warfare are not efficient enough to permit wide conquest . No matter how skillful his sailors and how brave his warriors , no king could administer a territory larger than a New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spears . When Captain Cook arrived at the island of Hawaii he found that the ring of villages that encircled the central volcano had been united into a single kingdom , as large as any in Polynesia . After the Hawaiians had taken over the ships and firearms of the white man , Kamehameha I was able , in 1795 , to unite them under a single rule . We know the details of the social structure of his kingdom , ' both before and after his conquest . It was probably the most complicated Neolithic society to survive into the period when modern educated men were able to see and describe it . As no better account of an intricate Neolithic social system can be found anywhere , it deserves our study . From the details of its institutions we can see how complex Neolithic societies could have been five thousand years ago , and how efficiently men using Neolithic technology in a favorable environment could convert energy into social structure . The early European observers , rank-conscious because of the social structure of their own countries , observed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slaves , each with its special duties , privileges , and insignia . The nobles could also be distinguished by their physique , for they tended to be larger and fairer-skinned than the others , no doubt footnote This picture of Hawaiian culture is based on David Maio , Hawaiian Antiquities , B. P. Bishop Museum Special Publications No. 2 , Honolulu , 1903.  | as a result of differences in diet and shelter from the sun . This is true of nobles everywhere , including Europe and Arabia . As in other rank-conscious countries , genealogy was of utmost importance to the Hawaiians . Every person of any consequence could trace his descent on one or the other side , if not both sides , to the time when the islands were settled , twenty-four generations before , and beyond that to the gods . A typical genealogy would go back through the father 's line for several generations , then switch to the mother of a certain ancestor whose father had been of lower rank than his spouse . The king was a person whose ancestors all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this distinction , the youthful monarch married his sister . After an heir had been produced , he and his queen could take other mates , and usually did . Some of the nobles were deputy rulers of outlying districts , others soldiers , priests , and courtiers , all resident in or near the royal compound . One courtier was keeper of the royal wardrobe , another the steward in charge of the king 's food , another the keeper of the royal chamber-pot . Others were poets and professional dancers . One of the most important offices was that of genealogist . He and other long-memoried courtiers attended the king at official meetings of the council of nobles . On these occasions two guards were posted outside the throne house . When a person presented himself for admission , a guard called out his name . Then the company inside challenged him , demanding : " From whom are you descended ? " After the newcomer had traced his descent through the male line for ten generations and the genealogist had verified his statement , he was admitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten generations in the female line , and so on until all had been seated . The courtiers were fed from the royal larder , which was filled by gifts and taxes rendered in the form of foodstuffs and clothing . In addition the king owned all sea mammals that drifted ashore and all of the iron washed in on wreckage , particularly the hoops of barrels . Before Captain Cook 's arrival , the Hawaiians had been using this metal for some time , cold-hammering and grinding it into chisels and weapons .  | The courtiers , much given to sports , games , music , and the dance , had a reputation for licentious living , including homosexuality , and for arrogance and rapacity in their dealing with commoners . The nobles who were destined to hold high government posts , however , were secluded as youths and assigned to tutors of ripe age and wisdom . Among the commoners the men followed special occupations , which were to some extent hereditary . While the majority were farmers or fishermen , a minority were craftsmen . Probably not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the base of the industrial pyramid were the axmakers , a highly esteemed group . The carpenters who bought their axes were divided into the categories of shipwrights , house-builders , and tapa-log makers . There were also workers in fibers , including net-makers . These craftsmen exchanged their products with farmers and fishermen on a simple barter basis . Because each island was large and varied enough to produce everything its people needed , there was no inter-island trade . Little is known about the lowest class , perhaps inaccurately described as " slave . " Its members , few in number , were specially tattooed on the forehead or about the eyes . Like the outcastes of India and the Etas of Japan , they were not allowed to enter the houses of the higher classes . Each family compound contained five houses of a single room . They were the connubial chamber , the man 's eating house , the woman 's eating house , the woman 's tapa-beating shed , and the house in which the husband kept his idols . Outdoors were two separate cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wife could not enter her husband 's eating house or shrine , on pain of death . While menstruating , the wife occupied a sixth structure , a special hut , the only habitation in which her privacy was assured , for the penalty for male intrusion was death . The roster of Hawaiian gods , goddesses , and minor spirits reflects the areas of disturbance in the people 's life . Kane , the creator or over-all god , symbolized the relationships of all the people to one another and hence was the special god of kings . Ku , the god of war , represented the relationship between kingdoms ;  | Longo , the god of agriculture , the source of food and hence of the crises that might arise if it were cut off by drought , hurricane , or war . A fourth god , Kanaloa , symbolized the ancestor cult and the ceremony of kava-drinking , comparable to the tea ritual of China . As ancestor-worship and kava-drinking were noble activities , the nobles worshipped Kanaloa . Carpenters worshipped eight male gods and one goddess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one major deity and many minor ones devoted to different aspects of their work . In all the special trades and occupations the same principle was applied . If one were to list these gods , one would have an outline of the division of labor in Hawaiian society , a highly complex system . In his private shrine each commoner kept his personal idols , which he believed to be the perches of his gods , or at least sensitive spots through which his prayers could be transmitted to the home of the gods in the sky . He worshipped them privately , praying aloud and making sacrifices of food . The nobles and king worshipped in temples , where their prayers were said for them by priests . The priests also performed public ceremonies , including human sacrifice , on holy altars in the sacred enclosure near the palace grounds . The proximity of temple and palace symbolized the twin forces of government and ritual in maintaining order in island society . The Neolithic priests , as exemplified by the Hawaiian hierarchy , had gone a long way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for service to the four great gods , and within each of the four divisions some were specialists at praying and others at sacrificing , while still others , in the role of oracles , interpreted the will of the gods from tapa-covered perches high on poles . Special clergy of another category recited on occasion the long and complicated legends , carrying their ancestors back to the days of creation , which served the same purpose as holy books in literate cultures , recounting the deeds of the gods , of early kings , and of priests who had led the people in worship long before . The chief privilege of the king , and indeed his principal vehicle  | of authority , was his right of privacy . So powerful was his person believed to be that if he should venture out of his palace all commoners would be forced to fall on their faces , or risk instant death . No one could sit in a higher position than he , and only special persons could eat in his presence . As a rule , to avoid disturbance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the time when the court was held , first by the light of kukui-nut candles , then by coconutoil lamps after the evening meal was finished , and finally by torches until dawn . The right of privacy took the form of the issuing of tabus , a word that has found its way into our common language . When the king placed a tabu on an object , class of objects , period of time , or action or class of actions , that meant that no one but himself could have the object , or do the act , or that during the designated time span all normal activities were to be suspended . The punishment for breaking a tabu was death . While execution was in the hands of the king 's guard , so firmly did most people believe in the efficacy of tabus that fear could provide its own punishment . By the same token the king 's own health was in mortal peril at all times lest some subject break a tabu , and his every illness and indisposition was a source of constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human sacrifice . This was , however , a relatively merciful death , for the victim had no advance warning of his designation , but was clubbed from behind into unconsciousness . All in all , Polynesian culture as exemplified by the Hawaiian suited its rich tropical environment . The possession of good polished-stone tools , a wide range of cultivated plants , three meat animals , good sailing ships , and an abundance of fish permitted the Hawaiian people to live well and to be numerous . In a land where little effort was required to obtain food , an extreme development of specialization not only kept everyone busy , but also allowed the rise of excellent art . In times of national crisis the tabu system , which in ordinary times may have seemed burdensome and unnecessary , kept order and prevented panic . If a hurricane destroyed all the coconuts but a few , the king could say who would eat and who would die . If warriors from another island invaded ,  | the king would command his men , in strict discipline , clad in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system served to keep order in any crisis foreseeable to Polynesians . With the arrival of white men out of the sea in huge ships with square sails , cannon , and muskets , order broke down , just as ours might were flying saucers real . The vivid modern accounts of Polynesian culture as it functioned in Captain Cook 's time serve to let us know how rich a Neolithic civilization could become . Western Neolithic Culture Survives in the Atlantic 8 J U S T as an eastern form of Neolithic culture lasted in the islands of the Pacific until the age of discovery , so did the western Neolithic form , from which our own civilization is derived , survive in remote islands of the Atlantic . The place was the seven islands of the Canary archipelago , isolated in the stormy seas off the coast of the Spanish West African colony of Rio de Oro . The inhabitants of these islands , whom the Spaniards conquered in the fifteenth century , were Berbers , related to the Riffians , Shluh , and Kabyles of Morocco and Algeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one time their mainland ancestors must have made boats , for otherwise they could not have transported themselves and their animals to the steep shores of these mountainous islands . At the time of discovery they had no ships and no way to communicate between islands . The reason was that the islands contain no stone suitable for making polishedstone axes . The few that have been found by archeologists were made of imported stone and probably dated from the arrival of the inhabitants . The lack of axes limited their carpenter work , but not their capacity for a rather elaborate social organization , for they still had Neolithic food plants and animals . Although the details differed from island to island , these people were growing wheat , barley and beans , as well as figs . Their domestic animals were the dog , sheep , goat , and pig . The lack of footnote 9 See E. A. Hooton , Ancient Inhabitants of the Canary Islands , IIarvard African Studies , Vol. 7 , Cambridge , Muss. , 1925.  | cattle of course meant that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milked their horned animals and made cheese . On all the islands they made coarse pottery , but on the largest island , Gran Canaria , they had advanced to painted pottery , which is also still made by mainland Berbers . Weaving either had not reached them or had been abandoned . Their garments were made of curried goatskins partly tanned with some red vegetable material . The needles with which they stitched their capes were of bone , as were many of their other implements . For houses they erected windowless single-storied edifices of mortarless rough stone masonry . One house , that of a king , was paneled inside with wood . In view of the lack of axes , this was a great luxury . On the smaller islands , life was uncomplicated , and social structure simple , as is true today on such isolated dots on the ocean as Corvo in the Azores and Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic . The way of life was insular as well as Neolithic . On the larger islands , notably on Gran Canaria and Teneriffe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainfall heavy enough to support several thousand people . Distances were great enough and mountains steep enough to isolate individual villages inhabited by people whose only means of transportation was on foot . Two ingenious devices helped reduce the effect of these distances . The men pole-vaulted over the mountain streams and meadows , and had worked out a whistling language for communication between distant hills . Each of these islands was divided into villages , and these villages were grouped into independent kingdoms . The kingdoms varied in number from island to island and from time to time , but there were never less than two per island . In each kingdom two social classes existed : commoners and nobles . The commoners , who wore short hair , tilled the fields and herded the animals , milked them , and made the cheese . The nobles were not permitted to perform any economically useful task ; their business was administrative and military . Despite the crudity of their tool kit , they made excellent spears , with tips notched to break off in the wound . They also made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Homeric gods , to ward off blows . At slinging stones they were most expert . Limited to these  | weapons , they stood off the Spaniards for many years , the relief of the nobles from work having given them the time for martial exercises , and particularly for military organization and discipline . It should be noted that the division of labor in this Neolithic community was not primarily between men and women , as with the garden-tillers of Melanesia and aboriginals of North America , but between nobles of both sexes and commoners of both sexes . Not all men were warriors , only noble men . The king himself stood at the head of the noble group , their leader in war and peace , but he could take action only after full consultation with his council of nobles , who convened for this purpose at a special place . One special privilege of the king was the right to sleep with his host 's women wherever he went , and the children so produced were ennobled when they came of age , providing that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were two kings , each fully independent ; but both recognized the judicial primacy of a religious leader who , by his knowledge of tradition , by supernatural activities , or by both , passed on the legality of administrative matters . On the hilltops were shrines to which people repaired in time of stress to sacrifice milk and butter to the spirits of their ancestors , and a special white building housed a company of priestesses clad in white goatskin robes and ruled by an abbess . This building was sanctuary . Any man fleeing an enemy could take refuge there , and no one dared harm him . In times of crisis , as during a drought , the priestesses would lead the people in a procession to some rocks by the shore , where they would make sacrifices , beat the waves with sticks , and wail . The island also contained a special shrine housing two statues , male and female , and a number of sacred rocks to which pilgrims repaired . There can be little question that in its basic principles the social structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East and Europe , the cultural basis from which Bronze Age civilization , and hence our own modern culture , has evolved . Mixed agriculture , with cereal culture and herding , provided balanced work for both men and women , and enough of a surplus to support an elite whose primary occupation was human relations  | rather than technology . Specialists in government , law , and ritual , standing at the head of political and religious institutions , held this society together internally by their ministrations in time of crisis , while the body of the elite , acting as a military force , took care of international troubles . Pilgrim shrines , colleges of sacred women , oracles , and temples of refuge are ritual phenomena that we shall see over and over again in the history of the civilizations derived from this Neolithic culture , in the Middle East , in Europe , in China , and in India . The oft-repeated statement that our ancestors went through an early agricultural period of woman rule , female inheritance , and the worship of a supreme fertility goddess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The main line of cultural evolution that has culminated in our modern western civilization has followed a path in which the relationship between the sexes has been constant from hunting days to the present . Sex and Magic in the Neolithic ANOTHER belief commonly expressed by social theorists is that Neolithic farmers , once they had become aware of the role of sex in the reproduction of plants and animals , invented orgiastic rituals to help nature along in its task of procreation . In New Guinea , for example , we know that Neolithic cultivators have a habit of copulating in their gardens as an agricultural ritual . At first glance it would seem that they were evoking human fertility in order to promote that of plants , but this explanation is based on modern thinking and is not a product of the Neolithic mentality . In order to understand this rite , a brief review is necessary . Among hunters who make their living by killing animals , sex has little to do with their attitude toward work . Only when women are menstruating or in childbirth must they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the food-winner must not be implicated , for he must be disturbed as little as possible . Among garden-cultivators , however , whose women do most of the agricultural work , the men have little to do .  | Seasonal expeditions into the forests after game keep them busy , and provide them with a framework of organization , as a large hunt that takes several weeks must have a leader who can enforce discipline . Sometimes instead of hunting they go on the warpath to lift heads or scalps from their neighbors . This requires even more discipline than a hunt and produces even more excitement . Both hunting and fighting give the men a feeling of superiority over their women which they need to compensate for the woman 's superior role in food-production . In preparation for such an expedition the men exclude themselves rigorously from the women , remaining celibate and practicing for the tasks ahead , just as soldiers drill and shoot on the rifle range . Full concentration being needed as well as a feeling of superiority , any attention paid to women would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Once the men have killed their game or slain their enemies , they return , resplendent in paint and feathers , and bearing meat or heads . Now the women , properly impressed , flock out to meet them with high enthusiasm , and sexual activities will be resumed with the abandon traditionally tendered to conquering heroes . The orgies that ensue on such occasions are no more vigorous or promiscuous than the reunions of several bands of primitive food-gatherers when they meet once a year to conduct ceremonies in common while feasting on some ephemerally abundant bounty of nature , like a crop of wild cactus or the corpse of a stranded whale . The difference between the attitudes toward sex held by hunters and planters is simply this : hunters notice that the time when it is easiest to kill is the time when the animals are preoccupied with sex , and that this is also the time of year when meat and skins are prime . In the Andaman Islands , turtle harpooners rejoice when their disk-shaped quarries copulate . Hence , in hunting magic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals will dull their warning senses and let themselves be killed . If the hunter abstains from sex at all , it is to remain more alert than his prey . When the senses of animals are befuddled , his must be keen and clear . Since the connection between sexual intercourse and procreation is not manifest , hunters do not worry  | about reproduction . All female animals reproduce anyhow ; this is not important to him . All women are married , most women have relations with a number of men at one time or another , and women , as a rule , have babies . The father of a child is the husband of the woman who bears and rears it . Some of the world 's most aboriginal peoples have , in modern times , shown an ignorance of the basic cause-and-effect relationship between sex and procreation , though there are anthropologists who will deny this . The point is that while the people in question are quite bright enough to understand this matter , it is not important to them . To the farmer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cleavage appears between sex and agriculture ; in fact , women work the gardens , women are sexual creatures , and therefore copulation and cultivation are equivalent and linked . The most important thing you do with women makes the garden grow . This is a much more reasonable explanation of the magic of primitive cultivators than the idea that they understand the sex life of plants or very much about their own . However , the farmer who keeps herd animals and who kills off most of the male offspring in his preoccupation with the supply of milk is much more concerned with sex , as the comparison of animal and human behavior is much more obvious and his interference more patently useful . Agricultural rituals , such as those of the ancient Greeks , which include sex , emphasize the animal world by using goat horns , cloven hoofs , and tails as symbols . In most human societies mechanisms exist to ensure the sexual satisfaction of nearly everyone . Our society , or the society from which we are emerging , is unusual in that so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project our own anxieties onto the lives of others to whom sex is a constant , and hence nothing to worry about , a matter far less important than the question of whence the next meal will come . The principal preoccupation of a primitive herdsman is not the sex life of his animals , which under normal circumstances will , like his own amorous activities , take care of itself , but their proper care , safety , and health . This is reflected in the common folklore of every European people , and in our own familiar nursery rhymes .  | " This little pig went to market , this little pig stayed at home . " " Little Boy Blue , come blow your horn , the sheep 's in the meadow , the cow 's in the corn . " Barnyard animals and flock animals which are herded into folds or sheltered through the winter in caves live under unnatural conditions of crowding and uncleanliness . They are prone to attacks by contagious diseases . These diseases are dreaded . In ignorance of the true cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch farmer , turns to the supernatural world for an explanation . Some evil-doer has hexed his herd . Some vampire is secretly sucking the life 's blood from the veins of his withering cows . Who is that evil-doer ? Probably some person whose very presence is a cause of disequilibrium in the community . Perhaps it is some ancient widow living on charity and cackling between her toothless gums as she waddles bent-backed along the path . Perhaps it is that loudmouthed fellow on the other side of the village who annoys everyone by his avarice and evil temper . He was seen spitting blood a few days back ; he must be the one who has been sucking the cows . Kill him . Kill the old woman . Hire a magician to make up a potent charm of unusual substances , along with scraps of cloth or hair from the evil-doer ; slip this under his pallet . It will fix him . Or hang some shiny beads of bear 's claws around the cow 's neck ; they will scratch him . Magic , magic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal , but it can restore the husbandman 's peace of mind . It can provide an excuse for the community to rid itself of persons who trouble their fellow villagers , though the villagers can not explain exactly why ? they have not studied anthropolgy . With the witch dead , the vampire staked through the heart , the community can face its troubles with renewed vigor . When , in the ages of metal , cities arose , the villages were left behind , virtually unchanged . The new division of labor between kinds of communities did nothing to alter the daily activities of villagers , or their relations with one another , that could affect their way of thinking . The Neolithic mentality is still with us in most of the world , a social coelacanth on the beach of time and an impediment to global peace and unity .  | The Barrier of Race As we stand today on the threshold of the fourth phase of history , the human species , unified in phase one , faces several threats , behind which lies a single source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival of Neolithic-style villages and of Neolithic mentality . Some peoples have advanced more rapidly than others in energy-consumption , technical skills , social complexity , political power , and an understanding of the nature of the universe , including human nature . Now that global means of communication have showed the inhabitants of straw villages in distant valleys and on remote islands the wonders of Hollywood and the benefits of modern education , the so-called underprivileged peoples of the world will not rest content until they have come to participate in an Atomic Age standard of living . In Asia and Africa social revolt is already under way . That the peoples of these continents should make orderly cultural transitions is to our interest also , for our own safety . Overpopulation can be reduced and epidemics controlled only when the peoples of all nations have reached a satisfactory level of modern culture without reduction of our own . One such reduction , austerity , is a mechanism of survival rather than of progress . If the world standard of living is to be raised peacefully , we must overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a distant ancestor , were once useful but now no longer are . Among the greatest of these barriers is race , greater even than differences in language and religion , because , while a man can learn a new language or change his faith , he can not change the color of his skin .  | There is nothing more shameful about belonging to a given race than there is in being a man or a woman , a child or an adult , because no one selects his own race , sex , or age . Whether or not the average mental capacity of one race exceeds that of another is also beside the point because even if such differences exist ? and we do not know yet whether they do or not ? each race includes bright , average , and dull people , no two of whom are exactly alike . We have yet to discover a society in which whole classes of persons are discriminated against because of their inability to pass intelligence tests . If such a society existed and the population included several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination is a holdover from a time when it served a purpose , when a racial division of labor carried with it a certain material and social efficiency . This purpose no longer exists , and now race is a nuisance . It can cease to be one only if we can make people understand it . That is the reason for this chapter . I have placed it in the middle of the book , between the chapters on the Neolithic and Bronze ages , because by 3000 n.c. , which was the dawn of written history , most of the races of the world had already come into existence . Those yet to be formed , such as the Polynesian , were in place when literate people first discovered them . By setting the time threshold of our study at the dawn of history , whenever it came in each part of the world , we give ourselves the advantage of historical and technical simplicity . America was still inhabited by Indians , and Africans had not yet been shipped over oceans and driven across deserts to serve peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their masters . Australia was still the land of the boomerang and the kangaroo . While simpler than the present period , the dawn of history was also more clearly documented than the ages that had gone before , our knowledge of which is based wholly on archeological records and cultural survivals . From this point on we have the fuller but less objective evidence of contemporary texts written or inscribed on stone , clay , papyrus , and skins , to supplement the familiar mute testimony of flint , polished stones , and sherds . What is even more important from the point of view of race , we now have  | access to accurate representations in the art forms of ancient Egypt , Mesopotamia , India , China , and other regions of the bodies and faces of human beings , many of which are shown in color . These look very much like individuals living today . The races of man have failed to change since the beginning of written history because no further changes were needed . All of the presently habitable regions of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each place enough generations had come and gone to provide material for the biological forces of mutation and selection , which are the only proved mechanisms of evolutionary change . The isolation , in the far corners of the land areas of the earth , of small local populations exposed to climatic extremes , is believed to have speeded up the pace . Thus racial differentiation arose not by chance alone , but by a natural Procrustean process in which the environment shaped the man to the heat or cold , to the drought or damp , and to the light or shade of the landscape he inhabited . Naturally at the dawn of history relatively few parts of the world were visited by Bronze Age writers and artists . However , so great has been the cultural lag in the far corners of the earth that many if not all of the races which existed at that time have survived into the modern age of scientific measurement and photography . A few racially distinct peoples like the Tasmanians are extinct except in tenuous mixture . Others , like the Fuegians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of man 's history die off after contact with Europeans and Asiatics because they lack resistance to our diseases . Measles killed most of the Ona in 1925 . It is possible that the extinction of other species as Homo sapiens spread over the earth in Late Pleistocene time may have been accomplished more by disease than by mixture . Human evolution since then has been more physiological than anatomical , an adaptation of the internal organs to the germs that attacked them when people began to live in settled communities and filth began to accumulate . The superiority of the white man over the aborigine is visceral rather than mental . To anthropologists the tag-ends of humanity , the few thousands  | of hunters scattered on deserts and marooned on islands hemmed by southern oceans , are just as important as the hundreds of millions of China , India , and Europe . So widely do these survivors differ from each other physically that their bodies show us how great was the plasticity of man when he had nothing but a fire and a few animal skins to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve the problem of man 's differentiation into races . Scientific Procedure and Racial Systems S u c H a solution requires a strict adherence to scientific procedure , which in turn demands that before a phenomenon can be explained it must be accurately described . This applies as firmly to race as to the expansion of steam under compression . Descrip lions involve the study of variations , which need classification if they occur regularly . In the case of man , variations in such features as size , shape , and surface color are particularly important because man is the most variable of animals . Throughout the scale of living organisms , variability increases with complexity . The viruses and single-celled organisms are little more variable than inorganic chemical compounds , and even among the coelenterates , such as corals and jellyfish , and among worms , one animal is much like another . In man , no two individuals are absolutely identical , and variations of body chemistry and personality are at least as great as those of visible anatomical features . Although unable to agree on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthropologists are beginning to borrow a concept widely used in the broader fields of botany and zoology . This is the Rassenkreis , ' which can be translated by the term racial system . Take , for example , the titmouse , a bird familiar to nearly everyone who lives in the suburbs or country . In the Old World a certain species of titmouse ( Parus major ) inhabits a 1 See Berthold Rensch , " Some Problems of Geographical Variation and Species Formation , " Proceedings of the Linnean Society , London , 149th Session , 1937 , pp. 275-85 , and Ernst Mayr , Systematics and the Origin of Species , Columbia University Press , New York , 1941.  | continuous band of terrain all the way from England to China . Although all English titmice are by no means identical , any knowledgeable bird-lover can tell one from a Chinese titmouse . An ornithologist faced with the body of one of these birds can even tell with a fair degree of accuracy where , between England and China , the specimen was collected . The species of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which all members are similar in general , but in which a gradual change in such characteristics as size , shape , and color can be plotted from one end of the bird 's geographical range to the other . If the country in between were all flat and if changes in rainfall , temperature , and brightness of light were all very gradual , then only gradual changes in the size , shape , and color of the birds could be expected . However , its range crosses mountains and seas , and passes abrupt transition lines between forests and grasslands which divide the land of the titmice into a number of distinct provinces . In each of these provinces the titmice are visibly and racially different from those inhabiting the next ornithological duchy , because mating across barriers is less frequent than unions within them . Now and then the territory of a racial system is discontinuous , particularly when part of it is formed by islands . Birds , mammals , and other forms of life that are blown or washed out to sea and that survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate with their kin left behind them . If conditions of climate , soil , and terrain are new to them , changes may take place rapidly , with extinction as the alternative . That is why naturalists find so many new or unique species on islands , where processes of differentiation may pass the bounds of races . As man can neither swim far nor fly , he was unable to reach such isolated places before the Neolithic , and since then culture has made species-differentiation unnecessary . Only exceptionally in historic times have human populations been completely isolated , and then for but a few generations . The period of speciesformation in man fell much earlier , while racial differentiation was aided by the invention of warm clothing , snowshoes , sleds , boats , and other devices that let him move into extreme climates in phase  | two of history . Since then man has formed a human racial system of global spread ; in this system major races have developed in climatically extreme geographical provinces , and intermediate forms have developed in between them . One special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World , has a private racial system within the range of other races . Popular Attitudes toward Race THE ORNITHOLOGIST , interested in titmice in particular or birds in general , runs into little trouble with the public , because the birds have nothing to say about whether or not they are to be studied . The field worker in physical anthropology runs into all sorts of trouble because each time he measures a human being he has to tell him why , and obtain his consent . In many countries he first must convince the government of the purity and objectivity of his intentions . During World War II race was used as a national symbol , and even before that in colonial areas natives were made to feel sensitive about color . It is no wonder that persuasion is sometimes difficult . Even before race had become unpopular in America and Europe , and before the pigmented peoples of much of the world had been given political independence and hence the choice of whether or not they should submit to anthropometry , the field worker encountered barriers of still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's peoples believe that the touch of shiny metal instruments on their skins will somehow injure their souls , and that the camera is an evil eye devised to trap their spirits and to enslave them . Blood-letting for blood-group analysis falls into the class of blood-letting in general , and evokes the whole ideology of blood-brotherhood , the fear of injury by contagious magic , and that of ritual condemnation based on the analogy of menstruation . Once in a while magic helps , but not often . One wintry day in a small mountain village of northern Albania I set up my stand outside the house of the bairaktar , or clan chief , while my wife  | seated herself on a case-oil box with her book of measurement blanks and her battery of pencils , struggling to write down the numbers and descriptive words I called off , despite the double hazard of speed and cold fingers . " Slow down , " she said . " My hands are stiff . " My vocal pattern shifted in an effort at accommodation , and while measuring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To my surprise I soon found that men were forming in line to be measured . They looked up at me with happy faces . Then , between subjects , I asked our interpreter his explanation for this change of attitude , and he answered : " Now that you are talking more slowly they think that you are praying . All of them want to receive your blessing . " When it comes to collecting skeletons , there is no such chance of competing with the clergy . In fact , men of whatever cloth in the local fashion frequently show up at excavations to make sure that their honored dead shall not be disturbed . More than once have I raised my eyes to see a row of bearded and turbaned mullahs squatting on the edge of my trench , asking about each bone as it rose from the ground : " Is it human ? " Mullahs are not the only ones who object to disinterment . A physical anthropologist was once jailed in a Cape Cod town for removing the skeletons of a few American Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mounds which the owner wanted leveled for agricultural reasons . The anthropologist was jailed not just for digging up Indians , but because these particular Indians , it was claimed , had been converted to Christianity . Once the facts are in , further hazards must be faced at the time of publication . Fundamentalists of several religious persuasions still erroneously believe that the study of race among fully evolved men somehow pertains to evolution , and they are against it on general principles . While dying out , their objections are not yet feeble enough to be disregarded . More serious are the activities of the academic debunkers and soft-pedalers who operate inside anthropology itself . Basing their ideas on the concept of the brotherhood of man , certain writers , who are mostly social anthropologists , consider it immoral to study race , and produce book after book exposing it as a " myth . " Their argument is that because  | the study of race once gave ammunition to racial fascists , who misused it , we should pretend that races do not exist . Their prudery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudery about sex . These writers are not physical anthropologists , but the public does not know the difference . At the other extreme stand the geneticists who are eager to see race studied and have given us some valuable concepts and techniques . In combination with taxonomists they have shown that no race is " pure , " in the sense that no group of animals or persons living together as a breeding population is completely homogenous in all inheritable features . Even in Finland , where most people are blond , some have brown hair . In nearly every population yet studied , except for a few groups of American Indians , more than one blood group is to be found . What characterizes a race is a given proportion of each known set of features . All desert Arabs are not narrow-nosed , but most of them are , and a narrow nose is one of their distinctive traits . Geneticists who work with such rapidly breeding and easily studied species as fruit flies and Indian corn usually refrain from classifying their specimens into races until they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For obvious reasons this is impossible with man . Were we to await the day when the genetics of skin color , eye color , hair form , and hair quantity , to cite but a few variable human features , should be as well known as the inheritance of blood groups and hemophilia , we would be unable to speak of race for decades to come . We do not need to wait for the simple reason that before the inheritance of a character can be determined it must be described , and all of its variations plotted geographically . The biologist who studies race among birds and mammals is less concerned with laboratory genetics , which he can seldom arrange , than with observable variations in size , shape , and color , many if not all of which can be attributed to environmental adaptation . He knows that , whether adaptive or not , they are all inherited , though he can rarely trace the exact channel of transmission . Ile also knows that some characters , like the blood groups in man , are inherited without margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  | exactly what the genes have ordered . Another example is the shape of the teeth . They can be worn down , broken , or ulcerated , but they never grow once they have been formed . Other features are less closely controlled . A man 's stature depends on a number of genetic factors , and can be influenced by nutrition . A woman 's skin may be white or dark brown , depending on how much time she spends on the beach or under a sun lamp . What she has inherited is the capacity of her skin at a certain time of her life to be a certain color if unexposed , and its further capacity to respond to the power of the sun with a change of color . A Negro 's skin generally lacks the latter capacity , as does that of an albino . One is black without the sun , and the other can not darken with it . An American Indian or an Arab has the greatest range of possible skin colors , all of which may be seen on different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure and the strength of the sun 's rays in the region in which each lives . Still , one must say that the skin colors of both Negro and Arab are inherited , but in a more devious fashion than the mechanism which governs the shapes of their teeth . My view of race is that as all characteristics are inherited , one is as interesting as another . ' Some are merely easier to trace than others . As the primary , visible criteria of race are adaptive features , we must regard the division of mankind into races as the total product of his adaptation to various environments at various times in the past . That members of different races should look as unlike as a squat Eskimo and a long-legged Watusi noble is not surprising . No other animal except man 's oldest domestic companion , the dog , has been able to live in so many environments , and he has succeeded only with his master 's help . No other animal except the dog is as variable . 2 See C. S. Coon , S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles C. Thomas , Springfield , Ill. , 1949 ; and C. S. Coon , " Climate and Race , " in Harlow Shapley , ed. , Climatic Change , Harvard University Press , Cambridge , Mass. , 1953.  | Man 's Six Geographical Ranges THE MAJOR racial variations of mankind , as they were seen at the dawn of history ( according to the adaptive view ) , occupied six major geographical ranges , each of which appears to have constituted a racial system . By this it is not meant to imply that man is more than a single species . So numerous and so widespread is he , however , that finer distinctions can be made than with most other animals . The proof that only one species is involved is that each of the sub-systems dissolves along its boundaries by blending with its neighbor . Athwart the equator in Africa lived , at the time of our first accurate knowledge , a population of black-skinned people , most of whom had woolly hair . Non-anthropologists , who do not have to worry about scientific proof , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter , a keen sense of rhythm , and a love of dancing . Other such peoples similarly endowed were to be found in a discontinuous band across the Indian Ocean as far as New Guinea , with outposts as far afield as Tasmania , the Fiji Islands , and the Philippines . Some of these black-skinned peoples are extremely tall , others short enough to be called dwarfs , some thick-set , others skinny . All of them can be called Negroid , just as a simple means of classification , without implying which is descended from whom , or even that all tribes and groups so designated are genetically related to one another . North of the Negroids , in a band which includes North Africa , nearly all of Europe , and much of western Asia , live the Caucasoids or Whites . Their territory occupies the center of the land mass of the Old World . With a long ocean coast line and many seas , its area is climatically tempered by the proximity of water . Straight to ringlet-curly hair form , full beard development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexposed skin color of their bodies ranges from pinkish white to deep brown . This range is extreme . At one end , in northwestern Europe , live many individuals whose skin is so fair that it can not tan , but peels and burns again  | when exposed to strong light . Seafaring Scandinavians and Britons , and American oilmen in Arabia sometimes develop raw and puffy facial skin that looks like uncooked meat . For sunny environments their skins were never intended . At the other end of the range , in India and Ceylon , individuals whose facial features and hair form are identical with those of Europeans may have unexposed skins as black as those of Negroes . Like the Negroids , the Caucasoids also vary greatly in stature , weight , and body form . Some adult male whites who are not corpulent are more than twice as heavy and bulky as others . In all of eastern and northern Asia a third major racial sub-system is to be found , the Mongoloid . Mongoloid peoples have skins varying from brunet white , with a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coarse , black hair ; scanty beard growth , flattish faces , and eyes that may be embedded in thick fat , with a fold of skin , in extreme cases , stretched across the upper and inner corner of each eye . In this sub-system also , great variations of body size are seen , along with moderate variations in form . The racial domain of these Mongoloids , centered in the chilly land mass of central to northeastern Asia , extends seaward to China and Japan , along the mountains of southern China and eastern Tibet to southeastern Asia , and thence out to sea , via Malaya , to the islands of Indonesia , including Formosa . Although this statement is subject to much controversy , the American Indians of all tribes and nations from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego may be said to show some Mongoloid characters in facial features , skin color and texture , hair form , and shape and size of the extremities . Those who are least Mongoloid deviate in a Caucasoid direction . This tendency may reflect either an early Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that most Caucasoids and some American Indians are climatically unspecialized human beings . Negroids , Caucasoids , and Mongoloids occupy most of the earth 's land surface north of the equator , which is the land hemisphere and that half of the earth where most of the middle and later stages of human evolution probably took place . South of the main  | bulk of the Negroid domain , in the sea hemisphere , in the portions of the earth 's land surface that project from its central land masses , tag-ends of ancient humanity remain , culturally as well as physically archaic . Similar to Negroids , Caucasoids , and Mongoloids in some respects while unique in others , they are much harder for the classifier to fit into categories , let alone explain . In South Africa , for example , at the time it first became known to the literate world , the grassy plains , deserts , and scrub forests of this vast peninsula were occupied by a number of peoples who together formed a distinct racial sub-system , soon to be decimated and absorbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bantu tribesmen invaded , converging on the northward trek of the Dutch , who had landed at Cape Town . After the inevitable collision of these two invading columns , all that is left of the members of the indigenous sub-system which got in the way of this clash is about 55,000 Bushmen in the Kalahari Desert and a few thousand mixed descendants of the Hottentots , sub ' merged in the Cape colored population . The South African racial sub-system once included peoples of different sizes , as we know from a fair number of skeletons of various ages from the later Pleistocene to the present . Now all that we have to work with are the undersized and probably atypical Bushmen , some of whose ancestors had heads as large as Thomas Edison 's . Yellow skins , ranging to brown , flat faces , low orbits , Mongoloid-looking eye folds , and peppercorn hair so tightly curled that it leaves bare scalp between clusters , characterize the modern Bushmen , and may have also characterized the other tribes and nations of their racial sub-system . Other peculiar features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparable to the hump of a camel , and a forward stance of the penis when at rest . These two anatomical peculiarities alone set the Bushmen and their kin far apart from the rest of mankind , as befits the inhabitants of a geographically marginal area . In Australia , even more isolated and equally marginal , at least one other sub-system existed , and lucky we are that its various components lasted long enough to be studied . Most of the living aborigines are slender , long-limbed people with brown skins , little  | body hair , and wavy to curly head hair and beards . Their teeth are large and strong , their nostrils wide , and their eyes set far apart . Some of them , bearing heavy brow ridges and projecting jaws reminiscent of Solo man , look , and probably are , the most archaic of mankind . These are the desert people , who have survived because their land is of little use to white men . In the cool and fertile Murray River basin , and in the climatic paradise of Gippsland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the desert folk as much as a Bavarian differs from an Arab of the Rub'a al-Khali . These people were thick-set and heavy , with long trunks and short extremities . Their bodies were hairy to the extreme , and their beards luxuriant , while their scalps were subject to balding . Since theirs were the lands that the Englishmen found most suitable for settlement and cultivation , few aborigines of this category are left . The survivors live on reservations . There they wear white men 's clothing , which makes their unexposed skin color easy to observe . It is usually light brown . Their eyes are in some cases greenish or bluish , their hair sometimes red . Along the northeastern coast , in the only part of Australia covered with dense tropical rain forest , a third element appears , consisting of small , light-weight aborigines who have woolly hair and black skins . These people are obviously part of the Negroid racial sub-system , to which the other aborigines of the continent can not be assigned . In Tasmania , loosely joined to Australia by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroids , black-skinned and kinky-haired , resembling the dwarfs of the Congo , Philippines , and New Guinea more than any other peoples , but larger . Of these three elements in the Australian-Tasmanian population , the heavy-set , hairy , and lightest-skinned element , from the Murray River country and Gippsland , look most familiar to persons of European descent . At Harvard I used to show a slide every year in Anthropology 1 , casting on the screen the facial features of one of these aborigines , a portly old person with white hair and a mustache . Without fail , this exhibit always brought howls of laughter . Not until the third time I had shown it did I discover what the class found so funny . I finally found out that , in their  | opinion , the man in the picture looked exactly like me , particularly in September after a heavy sunburn . Another picture that pleased the nine-o'clock customers was that of a hairy Ainu from the northern island of Japan , who closely resembled Tolstoi or Darwin , depending on the individual student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obviously , Tolstoi , Darwin , and I , if I may be permitted to join such distinguished company on a purely anatomical basis , represent ( or represented ) individual survivals of genetic recombinations of an ancient and marginal European population , and these Australians and Ainus are , if not European , certainly marginal . Geographically speaking , Europe too is a fringe area . European , Australian , and Ainu marginals are relatively undifferentiated varieties of mankind , left over from man 's wide wanderings through Late Pleistocene time . Even more agreeable to the students , however , was a slide of a Samoan princess tastefully clothed in a tapa skirt , a necklace , and a headdress . Although she had died long before these students ? were born , her generous figure , back in style in the 1940 's , aroused the somnolent , and even persuaded the sophomores in the back row to glance up from their hidden newspapers . The princess looked like a generalized human being , with features that might be attributed to some midway point between the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture , as the students were told , then mixture seemed like a splendid idea . The princess belonged to the Polynesian-Micronesian racial sub-system , which today includes many American citizens , particularly in Hawaii . An Outline of Racial History L I K E any other descriptive framework , a classification of races is meaningless unless seen in the dimension of time . Our information about race throughout time is based on written records , artistic descriptions , and skeletal material . Only rarely are the soft parts of ancient peoples preserved . In Egypt it was the dry climate , rather than embalming , that kept the bodies of the Pharaohs and their subjects , as well as their furniture and their  | loaves of bread , intact . The same is true of the cliff-dwellers of the American southwest , of their sandals , and of their ears of corn . On the coast of Peru archaeologists and looters have disinterred thousands of mummy bundles consisting of desiccated Indians swathed in hundreds of yards of fine textiles . Desiccation has thus saved for us the hair , skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated and racially diverse peoples . Immersion has also saved a few fair-haired Scandinavian corpses dredged out of Danish bogs , and a squadron of Bronze Age riders and their horses buried under a stream in the Altai Mountains . Freezing has given us Eskimo mummies from the Greenland permafrost . Most of our information about early peoples in the times and places with which we are now concerned comes , however , from dry bones . Dry bones yield much information , but they are still little more than the props that held up the man . Because most of the digging has been done by Europeans in their own countries and in the Asiatic lands from which some of their ancestors came , most of the bones we have are those of early white men . In Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic times most of the skeletons recovered from Europe , North Africa , western Asia , and the Upper Cave of Choukoutien were those of bulky , thick-set , muscular people with large heads , broad faces , and prominent chins , like the famous Cro-Magnon skeleton . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild bull and the boar . In both Europe and North Africa the very earliest Upper Paleolithic skeletons were slender , and had narrower heads and faces than those that followed them . Resembling rather the greyhound and the gazelle , they patently had moved northward off the rich grasslands of the Sahara and Arabian desert , which received abundant rainfall during Wurm-glacial times when the storm tracks moving eastward from the Atlantic passed over them , far south of their present route . Few skeletons have been found in the Sahara , and these are hard to date because of soil erosion . In Arabia prehistoric archeology has not yet been started . Yet we can be reasonably confident , until other evidence upsets the theory , that these deserts were the home of the slender variety of  | Caucasoid man . In East Africa this type has survived among the slender , narrow-faced Watusi and other cattle people . In Upper Paleolithic or Mesolithic times some of these hunters crossed the mountains of western Asia to enter the grasslands and deserts of Turkestan . After the glacial icecap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of this same type began tilling fields and taming animals . The few skeletons that we have from this time and region confirm this identification . From their center in the Caspian basin these Neolithic people spread out in all available directions , around the Black Sea to the Danube Valley and up it to central and western Europe ; along the northern shore of the Mediterranean , to Iraq , Syria , and Palestine , to Egypt , North Africa , and Spain , and thence to western France and the British Isles ; to Afghanistan and the Indus Valley ; across the oases of the two Turkestans to the Upper Yellow River Valley , and across Korea to Japan . Along all of these Neolithic routes we can find traces of this gracile ( fine-boned and slender ) branch of the white race today . In Europe it is the predominant element in the genetic composition of many countries , in either its blond ( Nordic ) or brunet ( Mediterranean ) form , and the same is true in North Africa . In the Middle Eastern lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces of it in individuals , particularly in the north and west , and in Japan it appears in the linear build and narrow , prominent noses of the nobility . In the north of India it is also the principal racial element . However , the agriculture that went from China to southeastern Asia and thence to the Ganges was carried by other hands . The shift from plants that need winter rain to those that must be watered in summer was made by a new group of farmers in whose physical appearance the genetic characters of the original bearers of the art of cultivation could scarcely be detected . Our knowledge of the early movements of Negroids is as poor as our knowledge of Caucasoids is rich . From Africa we have only one skeleton of geological antiquity which anyone of authority has ever called Negroid , that of a man drowned in a now nonexistent river in the southwestern Sahara , probably in early post-  | glacial time . Its Negroid features are not very pronounced . No one is known to have found a single skeleton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cling to the forest , where leaching would soon dispose of their fragile bones . Nevertheless there is every evidence that people of one Negroid type or another ? that is , having broad noses , black skins , and woolly hair ? are exceedingly ancient in the lands forming the southern fringe of the Indian Ocean , and this is particularly true of the pygmies , or jungle dwarfs . These are found in small sylvan bands in southern India , in the Andaman Islands , in the Malay Peninsula , in some of the Philippines , throughout Melanesia , where they grade into larger forms , and in Australia and Tasmania . What the early history of these tiny people may have been is unknown . Are they all parts of a single family of congenital pituitary dwarfs , a sub-sub-system of their own within the Negroid racial galaxy , or are they people of different origins who grew to look alike because they did the same things in similar places ? No one knows . The history of the full-sized African Negro is equally obscure . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of narrowfaced and narrow-nosed people , while all of the southern part of the continent was Bushman territory , all that was left to him is the western Sudan , and that is probably where he developed . Since our first knowledge of Africa , the Negroes have expanded greatly . In the sixteenth century Ethiopia was invaded by hordes of Galla , non-Negro cattle people who had come from somewhere to the west and south . Someone or something must have pushed them . The Bantu occupation of East Africa coincided with this movement , and the subsequent southward march of the Zulu , Matabele , and other Bantu warriors toward the Cape took place at about the same time that the Dutch were settling there . By then Negroes were also being carried to the New World , and it is safe to say that the number of Negroes in the world today is hundreds , if not thousands , of times as great as it was in the year A.D. 1000 , less than forty generations ago . The Mongoloids are probably not as ancient as the Negroids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible only after the invention of garments , houses , and heating devices capable of  | keeping the human organism from freezing . Heat adaptation could take place at any cultural level . No fully Mongoloid skeletons are available from the times before the last advance of the Wurm glacier , and the chances are that it was only then that they arose . Their center of differentiation was without doubt northeast Asia , whence they spread along the Arctic shore to Bering Strait and the White Sea . Such is the mountainous structure of Asia that it was easier for such people to migrate to the east and south than to the west . By the time the bearers of agriculture arrived from the west , a hunting population of Mongoloid type covered China , while on the outer margin of Japan a fringe of European-like hunters , the Ainu , remained . With the expansion of Chinese civilization other Mongoloids , who had also learned about agriculture , moved southward and invaded what is now Burma , Siam , and Indo-China . This movement reached out into the islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Java , Bali , Borneo , and the Philippines , to name but a few , had become populated by an essentially Mongoloid people . Others , having mixed with the Australoid , or Ainu-like , aborigines of these islands , continued on out to the Pacific and sired the Micronesians and Polynesians . Meanwhile America had been fed with people over Bering Strait . The first to cross may have been somewhat like the Ainu , the last fully Mongoloid . In Australia itself the picture is very complex , as is always the case in marginal or refuge areas . It has been deduced on geographical grounds that the earliest inhabitants were those who most resembled the archaic Europeans , with Negroid dwarfs following , and finally slender , narrow-headed types resembling the pre-agricultural population of India . However , this sequence has not yet been tested by archeological work . In South Africa the various kinds of yellowskinned peppercorn-haired peoples were reduced by invasion and competition to a few hundred minute Bushmen living in the Kalahari Desert . And that , in a nutshell , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migration and expansion which are commonly called history . During that time all of the major races of mankind had developed . We are the remains .  | Ecological Rules Governing Size , Shape , and Color ONCE man 's prehistoric movements have been traced , the historic distribution of races begins to take on meaning . The true significance of race appears , however , only when we have studied its function . First of all , we know that nature is not wasteful . The arctic fox does not put on a white coat in winter simply by chance , or through any choice of his own . Wild animals of a given species vary from one end of their geographical range to another , and their variations follow definite ecological rules , of which zoologists have long been aware . ' One is Gloger 's rule : that animals living in wet forests tend to have black or red coats . Another is Bergmann 's : that animals of a given species are larger in colder regions and smaller in warmer ones . A third , Allen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasslands have longer extremities than those of the same , or closely related , species living in forests or on mountains . Rensch , the latest of the rule-makers , has showed that within a species or group of species those animals which live in the colder regions of the earth have longer hair than those whose homes are hot . He has further demonstrated that while arctic animals store fat all over their bodies beneath the skin , fat-storers who live in deserts , particularly warm deserts , carry it in lumps , as with the camel and fat-tailed sheep . These rules serve to describe uniformities in the adaptations of different species of warm-blooded animals to geographical variations in heat , light , and ultra-violet radiation . The solar spectrum , of which these are but three contiguous segments , ranges from a wave length of about 24,000 angstroms ( an angstrom is what physicists call one one-hundred-millionth of a centimeter ) to 2,900 . Wave lengths between 24,000 and 7,700 angstroms , called infra-red , produce heat alone . Between 7,700 and 3,900 angstroms lies the visible part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From 3,900 to 2,900 is ultra-violet , a range of invisible short-wave 3 An extensive bibliography on this subject may be found in my " Climate and Race " ( see note 2 , p. 189 ) .  | radiation which burns the human skin , tans it , and creates Vitamin D by irradiating ergosterol , a component of the body 's subcutaneous fat . ' Geographical variations in temperature are the result of the amounts of infra-red and visible energy which reach various parts of the earth 's surface after having been modified by other factors in their journey through the atmosphere . Both latitude and altitude affect their strength . Ozone , carbon dioxide , and water in the atmosphere reduce them . Seas , deserts , and snowfields reflect them outward , while clouds and the blue ozone of the outer sky bounce them back earthward . Vegetation absorbs them . Large bodies of water create winds which blow masses of cool air into warm regions and warm air into cool ones . All of these factors create irregularities in the pattern to be expected if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , extreme temperatures are the rule . Where they are small , the bordering oceans reduce the annual variation . The land masses of the earth ? are so distributed that all of the regions of great seasonal contrast lie north of the equator . Even subtler and harder to trace than temperature variations are those of ultra-violet radiation . In all parts of the earth 's surface , the U ? V waves that strike the outer atmosphere are of equal strength . The difference lies in the amount that gets through . All else equal , this depends on the angle of the sun to any particular point on the earth 's surface . When the sun stands directly overhead , the U ? V rays have a minimum of atmosphere to penetrate , and hence a maximum of penetration . When it stands at an angle of 45 ? to the earth 's tangent , by striking diagonally they have half as much atmosphere again to go through , and at an angle of 22 ? they have more than three times as much . Owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radius of the sun moves seasonally over a 44 ? path , from Capricorn in December to Cancer in June and back again , crossing the equator at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes . New York City , at a latitude of 41 ? N. Lat. , is capable of receiv- footnote 4 See Matthew Luekeish , Applications of Germicidal , Erythemal , and Infrared Energy , D. Van Nostrand Company , New York , 1948.  | ing , at noon on Midsummer 's Day , slightly more U ? V radiation than cities situated at sea level on the equator . However , because clouds and vegetation reflect and absorb U ? V as effectively as they do other segments of the radiant-energy spectrum , all of the tropical lands are not equally bombarded . During the current geological sub-period a girdle of forest covers most of the world 's equatorial regions . To north and south this is flanked by grasslands , which in turn are bordered , at the latitudes of the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer , by deserts . Only in Africa is there today a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the world 's greatest concentration point of U ? V penetration . On the basis of these regional variations in heat , light , and U ? V penetration it may eventually be possible to explain all of the ecological rules known , particularly those concerning color , size , and form . Gloger 's rule ? that animals living in moist forests tend to have black or red hair and birds black or red plumage ? probably has to do in part with the balance between sunlight and Vitamin D. Animals and birds obtain Vitamin D by licking fur and preening feathers . Vitamin D is produced in body oils by U ? V irradiation , which may be more efficient in dim light with black and red coats than with buff and gray ones . Some species of animals occupy both forests and open country . The forest-dwellers have dark coats , and the others buff or gray ones . Buffs and grays afford camouflage that is not needed in the dim light of the forest . When individual animals are taken from the open into the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that animals living in colder regions are larger than members of the same species inhabiting warmer regions ? depends on the need of all warm-blooded animals to maintain a constant internal temperature . Volume is a cubic measurement , and surface area is two-dimensional . The larger the animal , all else equal , the more volume it has per unit of surface area , and the greater its efficiency in preventing heat from escaping through the skin . In climates where the air temperature exceeds that of the body , survival depends on the organism 's ability to lose heat by radiation , convection , and evaporation . Therefore the smaller of two bodies , all else equal , is more efficient than the  | larger because its surface area is greater proportionately to its volume . Not so simple is Allen 's rule regarding the length of extremities , in which at least two principles are involved . As Allen discovered , a jack rabbit caught on the desert of Arizona has long ears , but a member of the same species shot in British Columbia will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiators , its chief vehicle for body temperature regulation . Where the normal air temperature is above body level , the body needs to lose much heat , and the ears are long . In colder regions , where the need for heat loss is less and the ears are in danger of freezing , they are short . Long legs are also characteristic of large animals living in deserts . Although these animals do not lose much heat through their limbs , long legs hold their bodies as high as possible above the superheated ground and let them travel swiftly , at a mininniun of effort , between grazing grounds or from grass to distant sources  | of water . As with the greyhound and the gazelle , the whole body architecture of desert animals is long , compressed , and rangy . Speed is what they are built for . In addition to these three major uniformities a number of other rules have been discovered . Rensch 's rule regarding length of hair concerns heat-regulation : witness the contrast between the Tibetan yak , with its long coat trailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-haired cattle of India . His rule regarding distribution of fat also concerns heat-regulation : while the fat of arctic animals keeps them warm , so that a polar bear can sit on a cake of ice without discomfort , it has to be evenly distributed over the body to be effective . In other climates fat can be also used for food storage if it is concentrated on small areas of the body so that it will not interfere with total heat loss . The fleshy knapsack of the camel and the fat-tailed sheep 's flapping appendage thus provide these animals with spare rations of energy on long trips in fodderless country without interfering with either heat loss or locomotion . Their Application to Man THESE ecological rules would have little bearing on the subject of this book were they not just as applicable to man as to yaks , polar bears , and fat-tailed sheep . Thanks largely to the efforts of the U.S. Quartermaster Corps during and since World War II , 5 to the research branches of the U.S. , Canadian , and British air forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the Fels Research Institute of Antioch College in Yellow Springs , Ohio , we are beginning to unlock the secrets of human racial variation . In man as in animals and birds , races seem to exist for the principal purpose of accommodating the organism to differences in heat , visible light , and U ? V radiation . We know , for example , that really black Negroes do not sunburn as severely as white people , nor are they as liable to skin footnote 5 See particularly L. H. Newburgh and others , Physiology of Heat Regulation , W. B. Saunders Company , Philadelphia , 1949.  | cancer . Their skins contain massed granules of melanin , or pigment , a chemical substance deposited in the deepest layers of the epidermis . Persons with unpigmented skins suffer sunburn , peeling , blistering , and even fever and prostration , because of the pentration of a very narrow band of U ? V radiation concentrated at a peak of 2,967 angstroms . Melanin absorbs these rays before they can reach the sensitive layers of the skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that produced inside the body by work and food metabolism . Negroes and other black-skinned peoples inherit dark skin pigment , while brunet whites and members of other races of intermediate skin color inherit the ability to acquire it by seasonal tanning . In regions of high latitude and seasonal cloudiness a white skin is advantageous , at least in winter , for it permits a maximum of Vitamin-D irradiation , which would be partly impeded by more pigment granules . In man , as in other hairless animals , Vitamin D is absorbed directly into the blood stream because it is produced inside the skin instead of on the hair cover . Negro skin also has a thick superficial horny layer . This resists scratching and impedes the penetration of germs , which need ten times as much U ? V to kill them in a hot , damp atmosphere as in dry air . Negroes infect less than white men in the tropics . For all these reasons the distribution of black-skinned peoples around the equatorial belt of the Old World makes sense , as does the concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The human eye is also concerned with U ? V regulation . The lens , while transparent to visible light , in all races completely absorbs atmospheric U ? V , thus removing a potential source of blindness . The eye also regulates the amount of light which it lets in by means of an automatic diaphragm , the iris . Except in the eyes of albinos , defective in this sense , the back of the iris is rendered opaque by a layer of melanin comparable to the dull black paint on the inside of the diaphragm of a camera , and serving the same purpose : to keep light from entering the chamber of the eye or camera except through the hole provided for it . In all races this  | peculiar layer of pigment is present in the eye of the embryo . Like the pigment of a Negro 's skin , the organism produces it unaided by the sun . This is the only pigment that we see in a blue eye . Although its real color is chocolate brown , the tissue in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venous blood seen through the skin of the forearm in a light-skinned person . In dim to moderate light , one layer of pigment is enough to keep the iris from letting in light . An additional layer , deposited on the outer surface of the diaphragm , prevents even extremely bright diffuse light from leaking into the chamber . Eyes provided with this extra protection appear brown . If the superficial layer is particularly dense , the eye appears to be chocolate brown , or black . Brown and black eyes possess a further advantage , a deposit of melanin granules among the rods and cones of the retina which absorbs diffuse light and helps prevent glare . The black eyelids of the Negro and the fat lids and narrow eye slits of the Mongoloid help to do this also . The gene , or combination of genes , which produces light eyes appears commonly among mankind , as among some nocturnal animals . Blue , gray , and green iris patterns are found among Australian aborigines , Ainu , some American Indians , Arabs , inhabitants of India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only those European populations long established in dimly lighted country like the British Isles and the lands around the Baltic , and recently established overseas extensions of these populations , possess light-colored eyes in the majority . Blond hair is also shared by Europeans with other peoples . Some Australian aborigines living in the desert are blond in childhood , and a few remain blond until their hair turns white . Blondism also turns up among monkeys and chimpanzees . It is but one of many possible genetic variants in a very variable stock . Like that of light eyes , its frequency in a population can increase through genetic mechanisms . If it has a selective value , this remains unknown . While U V ' , Intl visible light influence the color scheme of ani-  | mals and men , extremes of climate set limits to their size and form . One extreme is damp heat , found in the tropical forests where tall trees form a leafy canopy overhead . The evaporation from their foliage keeps the temperature of the dimly lit , damp , and motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit in a saturated atmosphere . On deserts situated near the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer , during the times of year when the sun is directly overhead , the temperature often rises to 120 ? F. in the shade during the middle of the day , while on the stony or sandy surface of the ground it can rise perilously close to 200 ? F. In middle and high latitudes , the lowest temperatures are found in regions of high altitude far from the tempering presence of oceans . Northern Asia fulfills these requirements . Verkhoyansk , Siberia , the cold capital of the inhabited world , has yielded records of - 87 ? F. The whole belt of northern Asia , with an extension into northeastern Europe and southward to the Tibetan plateau , forms a block of cold country unequaled elsewhere in size and frigidity except by the uninhabited icecaps of Greenland and Antarctica . In the New World the mountains run north and south instead of east and west , as in Asia . Because of this simple fact , the comparable cold zone of North America is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had something to do with the comparative lack of differentiation of species and races , in both animals and men , in this hemisphere . As everyone knows , the internal organs of human beings operate efficiently only at a temperature close to 98.6 ? F. , with a very small margin of safety . These organs are grouped in two places , the trunk and the head . Neither the viscera nor the brain can be allowed to grow much hotter or cooler than the norm without serious loss of efficiency . At 77 ? F. and 110 ? F. death intervenes . On the other hand , the skin surface of the entire body and the inner tissues of the limbs can and do vary considerably in temperature without danger . Now the heat that the body produces in order to maintain this constant temperature comes from one source only , the food eaten . This food is converted into energy , which heats the body through the regular cell chemistry of the body and through muscular work . Each person must eat and  | everyone must lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep on functioning . When the temperature of the atmosphere is below 83 ? F. , the normal healthy white human being at rest loses his heat by radiation from the surface of his body . At 83 ? he begins to sweat . If the atmosphere is saturated and there is no wind , his perspiration fails to evaporate , and heat loss by this means is prevented . If the humidity is low , the perspiration evaporates satisfactorily up to a temperature of 104 ? F. Beyond these thresholds perspiration fails to evaporate rapidly enough to cool the skin . The heat load becomes great , and if work is done at such temperatures , it increases more . A man working under such conditions is obliged to drink large quantities of water . In eight hours he may drink as much as his entire blood supply . Under these conditions the heart of a normal white American is greatly overworked pumping blood through his extremities in order to provide his sweat glands with water . Little blood gets to the brain , which may be why it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot weather . Although the human skin has sweat glands all over , the principal channels of heat loss are the limbs , particularly the hands and arms . In a normal person under normal circumstances of sweating , twenty per cent of the entire heat loss of the body comes through the forearms and hands , and particularly the fingers . This is because of the relatively narrow form of these extremities , and the special richness of blood vessels in them , useful also to supply energy for manual work . When the temperature of the outside atmosphere is moderate , the blood that flows to the hands through the arteries returns along a network of veins that weave around the arteries . Thus the chilled blood returning from the hand cools the arterial blood on its way out , preventing much heat loss , and at the same time the returning blood is warmed before it gets to the heart . However , when the external temperature rises above the danger point , which is 83 ? F. , the venous blood returns through an alternate or emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the quantity of blood moving through the forearm and hand increases . The emergency network supplies the sweat glands Copiously , and thus the blood moving to the in-  | ternal organs is cooled . This emergency network is again activated at a lower threshold , 41 ? F. When the external temperature drops to this second danger point , the blood that has been flowing through the inner venous system again shifts to the surface and increases in volume . Thus the hands and arms are kept from freezing . The same process is carried on in the legs and feet , but to a smaller extent . Racial differences in both the length and the skin-surface area of the forearm and hand , and the pattern of veins directly underlying the skin have much to do with the ability of individual human beings to withstand extremes of heat and cold . The same is true of variations in the fat content of the body , particularly in the amount of fat directly underlying the skin . Young , active Negroes have less fat than most whites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In experiments made on the California desert in summer it has been shown that of the two the Negroes are the more efficient . ' The white man is a type of human being adapted for cool climates or for climates which have a moderate seasonal range such as one finds in most of Europe , North Africa , and western Asia , where white people have lived during post-glacial times . During glacial advances this zone of climate extended into the Sahara and Arabia , where white men then lived . In cold climates Mongoloids are more efficient than either whites or Negroes because they have the most body fat , especially under the skin , because their eyelids and cheeks are padded with fat which protects the eyeballs , because the supply of blood to their cheeks is relatively great . Body fat , useful as it is in the Arctic , must not be considered in the light of cold-adaptation alone . Human beings of all races who overeat , live indoors , and rarely exercise can become obese after the fashion of barnyard animals . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have become dependent on the protection of more active human beings , and in this sense they have domesticated themselves . Obese men and women may be footnote e Paul T. Baker , Heat Stress and Gross Morphology , OQMG Environmental Protection Branch , Report No. 197 , Lawrence , Mau. , 1953.  | found in any race and any climate . Like other kinds of adaptation , the capacity to lay on body fat was important in the formation of races at a time when all men lived outdoors and had to exercise their bodies in order to be fed . Under the steam-heated , air-conditioned , and labor-saving conditions of modern life all kinds of people can live nearly anywhere . The Meaning of Race SOME of the differences between human populations can be acquired in a single generation or a few generations . Americans born of Sicilian parents who immigrated in their twenties stand head and shoulders taller than their fathers . Americans of British ancestry who have attended Harvard are taller each generation . Some Americans born in Minnesota of Italian parents and others born there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finns are much bigger than old-country Italians . Sabras , the new generation of Jews born in Palestine , are larger and more robust than their ghetto-born parents . Many of the changes cited have as much to do with nutrition and outdoor versus indoor living as with changes in climate . The human organism is so plastic in size and shape that we can shift sizes and shapes in a few generations in response to new environmental stimuli , and shift back again as these stimuli are reversed . Other differences are more closely controlled by our genes , and these are ancient racial differences in skin color , hair form , face form , and tooth size . Such characteristics , when they are possessed by entire populations , can be altered only by mixture with other stocks and selection . While Negroids and the northern Mongoloids became adapted for living in physiologically trying environments , the Caucasoids or whites remained unadapted because they continued to live in parts of the world where climatic conditions were optimum in terms of heat and light , where the ultra-violet radiation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasonal tanning , and where , during most seasons of the year , a man 's vascular system was not overtaxed in keeping his body cool or warm . The whites arose in the Old World 's best land ; it was they who carried the  | main line of civilization to the threshold of the ages of metal , and beyond . This does not necessarily mean that only the whites have or had the capacity for creating cultural change . The Mongoloid peoples have produced high civilizations , as have the American Indians . In Africa , under climatic disadvantages , Negroes have developed social systems of considerable complexity and a high art , the quality of which the white world is just beginning to appreciate . Among the whites themselves one can see much lag ; the hairy Ainu of Japan is an aborigine pushed onto reservations by Mongoloids ; and the aborigines of Australia , particularly the few that remain of the tribes that were living on the cooler and more fertile lands when the English arrived , were still flint-chipping hunters within the memory of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its role in the development of man . It made possible the opening up of all areas of the earth not covered by ice , the domestication of many kinds of plants and animals , the invention of many categories of devices of transport and communication . Our modem civilization would have been impossible without the pooled contributions of many races . But during certain stages of cultural development , race served as a symbol of social and economic status , useful in maintaining order in a world in which many contrasts in wealth , technical skills , and levels of education had been preserved . This use of race as a symbol made a deep and lasting impression on the peoples of the world adapted for extremes of solar radiation . After the conquest of terrestrial space had progressed farther , and education had spread more widely , people who had been called black and yellow , and who had been kept out of the best clubs in their own countries , reacted violently , and the fruits of this reaction are still with us . Modern technical advance has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve some measure of cultural unity , just as Homo sapiens became a single species in Late Pleistocene time . The question is , how to achieve unity peacefully without loss of the variability necessary for further progress .  | During the first phase of history , race could hardly have been a serious social problem . Man occupied a single zoological realm , adaptation meant physical rather than social survival , and interrace competition was overshadowed by competition between genera and species . In the second phase , when Homo sapiens expanded into the cold parts of the Old World and into the Americas , life was still too simply organized for the rise of classes based on racial differences . We know this from our study of surviving hunters . During phase three of history , human ingenuity devised the means to provide comfort for a few and an increasingly elaborate division of labor . It was possible for kings and employers to move whole populations from one environmental realm to another . Then race became a symbol of rank and status . We know this because the Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its domain to control the northward movement of Negroes . This was done during the third millennium B.C. , near the dawn of written history , to which we now return in our survey of the story of man .  | face of the earth for tens of thousands of years and watching the movements of the glacial icecaps and the shifts in the edges of forests and deserts , could at length have seen , in certain mutilated places , numerous scars and bare spots on the planet 's skin where the hand of man had been at work . A number of straight lines and crisscrosses , recalling the canals on Mars vaguely and in a minor way , indicated the presence of irrigation ditches and their dependent fields . Dots on the glassy surfaces of great rivers , moving independently of the direction and force of each stream , gave evidence of inland navigation , and rows of smaller dots crawling over the yellow hills revealed the continuation of this organized transport overland on the backs of animals . Here and there a protuberance , rising like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up streamers of smoke from the many fires of brick kilns and bakery ovens , smelteries and foundries , baths and altars , of a small city or large town . In a few parts of the world the Bronze Age had begun . During the Neolithic the material base of modern life was laid down . People had learned to till the soil and to herd animals . The foodstuffs that they grew are still the principal ones that we eat . Farmers with no better means of transport than the backs of oxen and small boats had found that living in villages is the easiest and most economical way to exist . In late Neolithic times large communities had arisen in the more favored parts of the world The Significance of the Bronze Age ABOUT 3000 B.C. a celestial observer , after scanning the  | where transport was easiest , and where food could be accumulated and stored . It had already been found that quarrels between villages were unprofitable . Some central authority that kept the peace between villages more than earned its keep . Such authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there before the end of Neolithic times because it was already functioning by the beginning of the Bronze Age . Some writers have said that the need of regulating irrigation created government , but in my opinion this was but one of many factors . More important , I believe , was the ability of soldiers and police to move up stream and down by boat in the great river valleys of the Old World . The Early Bronze Age king was nothing more than an exalted version of the Bushman band chief who sits under a sacred tree , takes in all the animals killed , divides the meat , and distributes fire on which to cook it . The king took in all valuable commodities , kept a good share for himself , and distributed services in return ? famine insurance , maintenance of irrigation ditches , armed protection for travelers , an opportunity to trade with standard weights and measures , and , above all , peace and order under the sanction of law and religion . Transportation was facilitated by the domestication of the donkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; communication by the invention of writing . A leader could now reach a much wider audience than before , even persons unknown to him or to one another . When social institutions ceased to be simple face-to-face groups of companions and acquaintances , they grew formal , as organizations always do when they include strangers . The quintessence of formality now surrounded the person of the king , which at the same time became holy . All of the de luxe products of the craftsmen became his private possessions ? gold , stone vessels , metal weapons , statuary , jewelry , rare woods , and perfumes . There was no public distribution of luxury objects , except as gifts of the king . As the Bronze Age wore on and metal became commoner , this monopoly was gradually loosened . When horses and chariots were introduced into the river-valley civilizations , kings could send out military expeditions to conquer and plunder  | pyramid was narrow . Although writing was known to scribes , the common man was as illiterate as his Neolithic grandfather . Although warriors carried weapons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vitals with metal armor , most carpenters still adzed out house posts and ship 's keels with polished-stone tools , and farmers continued to reap their grain with flint sickles or imitation ones of very hard-baked clay . The farmer , laboriously goading his oxen through the rich mud of the riverside field , could see his king glide by in a fancy barge decked with precious stones and gold . When a king died he was buried in a sumptuous tomb , with oxen and furniture , weapons and ornaments , and with either the slain bodies of soldiers and handsome young women , or with miniature clay replicas of such ghostly servitors . By the beginning of the Bronze Age many of the peasants of the three river valleys in which these events took place , those of the Nile , Tigris-Euphrates , and Indus , had lost their status as free citizens , and had come to be separated from their increasingly powerful masters by as great a cultural gap as that which was to part the fellahin of these very valleys from their pashas and rajahs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had increased until each man no longer knew everyone he met ; encountering strangers became a commonplace event , and it is far easier to be brutal to strangers than to men whom one sees every day and with whom one has to live . While it is impossible to speak of the Bronze Age as a unified period , it is possible to conceive it as a period of transition from the simple kind of human relations obtaining among people on a single level of laborious hand technology to the more complex system found among peoples using mass-production techniques . By the close of the Bronze Age the inhabitants of these Middle Eastern valleys had achieved a kind of culture which no further inventions or world events could really shake until the dawn of the modern age of power machinery . In the meanwhile , details of the culture that these riverine peoples had acquired were disseminated in various directions by land and by sea . Their basic technological inventions , codes of law , scientific discoveries , and religious concepts were carried to nations situated in potentially  | richer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same Neolithic base , had failed to advance with equal speed . Bronze Age civilization depended on the use of three basic discoveries or inventions : the forced-draft charcoal-fed furnace , the rotating shaft , and writing . A fire that can generate inside an enclosed chamber a temperature of between 1100 ? and 1200 ? C. can be used to bake , in a single operation , a whole ovenful of loaves of raised bread . These loaves can be issued as standard rations to a large number of men engaged on a single work project too far away from home to have their food brought by wives or children . This heat can also fire a kiln full of pottery . The lower temperatures of wood-burning open hearths during the Early Neolithic produced thick-walled pottery , soft inside and easily broken , as well as thin pottery hard all the way through but too fragile for rough use . Bronze Age pottery is both thick and evenly fired , hard enough to be bounced about on the back of a donkey and unloaded on the ground without especial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be used to smelt ores , including copper , tin , gold , silver , and lead , all of which were in use during the Bronze Age . Once smelted , the metals can be cast , in pure or alloyed form , into a wide variety of shapes impossible or impractical with stone . While no harder than jade or basalt , copper and bronze can be cast into such convenient weapons as battle axes with hafting holes , socketed lanceheads , and tanged swords . The time it takes to make a metal weapon is but a fraction of that needed to produce a comparable one from stone or flint , and it is much less likely to break . Even if it does break , it can be remelted and recast , and nothing is lost . Sheets of metal can be beaten into armor much tougher than hide or fiber , and much more terrifying to look at . Metal rivets and nails and metal tires make possible the production of light , fast chariots ; though bumpy for ordinary travel , these revolutionized warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quick getaway . The prototype of the wagon was probably the summer sled , in use by both the Sumerians and the Egyptians , and still to be seen in outof-the-way parts of western Asia and Europe . Such a sled found in the royal cemetery of Ur contained no metal parts ; it could  | have been made in Neolithic times . In Egypt , heavier sleds , with rollers under the runners , were used to transport monumental stone . Whether or not wagons had been invented before the Bronze Age we do not know . It is more likely that the wheel was first used for manufacturing pottery , a speed-up technique that fed the furnaces of the kiln-operators and helped provide an abundance of large , strong containers for grains , wines , beer , and oils . The potter 's wheel was in turn probably suggested by the bow drill , of use to carpenters and jewelers alike , which was derived from the simple fire-shaft used by all of these peoples nearly to modern times and is now employed in ceremonies by Boy Scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotating shaft and wheel , on which our modern industry depends , was not made in the Bronze Age but had to await the discovery of cheaper  | metals , more abundant sources of power , and a number of subsidiary inventions , such as the toothed wheel . In each of these riverine societies the increasing complexity of government , religious affairs , and economic processes taxed the human capacity for memory to the point where writing was necessary , and writing was therefore invented . When the royal sculptors chiseled the statue of a king in hard stone , it was convenient to have them carve his name on the product so that there could be no doubt in the future as to which king had been meant . Royal treasurers needed stock lists , which Egyptian scribes indited with reed pens on sheets of papyrus , an invention that George Sarton , the renowned historian of science , hails as one of the greatest of all made by the ancients . In Mesopotamia , where stone was an import and papyrus was not made , other scribes impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shredded Wheat biscuits , baking them to ensure the permanence of their record . In both Egypt and Sumeria the metal that royal craftsmen fashioned into swords and diadems had to come from afar , and the finished products of the jewelers ' art , and that of the smiths , were as eagerly sought after in distant places as Captain Cook 's iron nails were in Hawaii . Royal expeditions to obtain ores and precious stones had to be protected . Traders whose business kept them away from home for months or years at a time needed the assurance that their property at home would not be molested . Written contracts were safer than the oral assurances of witnesses , who might in the meanwhile die or be bought off . In Egypt the seasonal rise and fall of the Nile , on which agriculture depended , had to be predicted . The agricultural cycle , the setting of days for markets , the prediction of wind and weather for those planning travel by land or by water , all produced the need for a calendar . Standards of length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation of both staples and precious commodities . From the effort of producing standards of time and space , and from the mathematical techniques of measuring and relating them , science arose . footnote George Sarton , A History of Science , h award University Press , Cambridge , Mass. , 1952 , p. 24.  | Early science was chiefly concerned with the study of the causes of variations in the climate , such as frosts and droughts , floods and rainfall , which affected agriculture . In Egypt farmers needed to know exactly when the Nile would rise in order to be able to plant their crops at the right moment , just as in a tropical forest , where no change in seasons is apparent , rice-planters must know when to expect the arrival of the rains . Because the events that became the subject matter of early science were also the causes of disturbances to people , and because priests exist principally to allay such disturbances , the pursuit of science became an attribute of the priests . Their ability to predict natural events made it appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this enhanced their power . Because disturbances to people and communities are the chief causes of lawless acts , the maintenance of the priesthood is the most efficient and least expensive agency for law-enforcement within a society in which all persons participate in a single culture , and whose beliefs are all more or less the same . But a secular authority is needed to deal with other peoples whose cultures are different in detail and who worship different gods . The efficiency of this authority , which used armed force to keep peace , was mightily increased in the Bronze Age over Neolithic standards by the possession of metal weapons and metal armor . Such twin hierarchies of church and state arose in Egypt and Sumeria , with the king supreme over both establishments . Egyptian Civilization of the Early Bronze Age 2 O F the two valleys in which these civilizations arose , that of the Nile is the simpler in structure because it contains but a single river . Its civilization likewise was less complicated by the proximity of other peoples than that of Mesopotamia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My principal source is Adolph Erman 's Life in Ancient Egypt , Macmillan &; Co. , London , 1894 , snpplemcnted by conversations with the members of the Egyptology Department of the t'niv'isity Mnsennt , Philadelphia .  | The Nile is what geographers call an exotic stream ; it rises far south of Egypt in central Africa , where it is fed by the summer monsoon rains from the Indian Ocean . Crossing the entire width of the Sahara , it flows between flanking deserts all the way from the Sudan to its delta . At various points in its desert passage it has hewn its way through outcrops of ancient stone , the northernmost of which , known as the First Cataract , formed a barrier to ancient riverine navigation and thus marked the southern boundary of Egypt . Between the Cataract and the apex of the Delta , the river formed an easy highroad for anyone with a boat . So common was river travel in ancient Egypt that the language contains a special word meaning " to be without a boat , " as if that were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely falls , the winds blow constantly from north to south , so that a boatman can sail upstream and then , lowering his sail , float back down again with the current .
