Day after day , Rookie Pitcher Alva Holloman of the St. Louis Browns plucked at Manager Marty Marion 's sleeve . " I 'm not a bullpen pitcher , " " Bobo " Holloman would say . " I 'm a starting pitcher . Give me a chance . " Manager Marion just kept shaking his head . Two or three times , Bobo was called in from the bull pen to do a little relief pitching . But the big ( 205 Ibs. , 6 ft. 2 in. ) , 27-year-old righthander was not very impressive : ten hits , five earned runs in 5 innings . One night last week , tired of Bobo 's sleeve plucking , Manager Marion finally gave in , told Bobo he could start next day against the Philadelphia Athletics . Bobo made the historic most of it . <P> <P> On his way to the mound in the first inning , lumbering Bobo paused and scratched a " G " and an " N " in the dirt along the third-base path . The initials were for his son Gary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stands along with a hard core of 2,471 other drizzle-soaked Browns fans . Inning after inning , Bobo went through the initial-scratching routine just once . But inning after inning , mixing fast balls , curves and sinkers , Bobo set the Athletics down . By the fifth , it began to occur to the fans that Rookie Holloman had n't give up a hit : when one of the A 's got to first on a slow roller to the mound that Bobo juggled for a moment , the crowd set up a shout for the benefit of the official scorer : " Error ! <P> Error ! Error ! " It was ruled an error . <P> <P> In the eighth inning , as the tension rose , the Browns ' Rookie Shortstop Bill Hunter made a diving stop of a hot grounder and threw out the base runner by a step . Bobo , who had already driven in three runs , enough to win his own game , heaved a huge sigh . In the ninth , the pressure finally began to unsettle Bobo just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight pitches , issued three more balls to the next batter . Manager Marion was so jittery that he could not bring himself to go to tie mound to try and settle Bobo down . Old Pitching Pro Harry ( " The Cat " ) Brecheen went out to the mound to talk Bobo out of his nervousness . Bobo threw a strike , then another ball , and he had two Athletics on the bases . The next batter hit into a double play-one out to go to a no-hit game .
