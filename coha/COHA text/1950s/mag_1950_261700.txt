<P> " German boys and girls , the capital of Germany awaits you , " read a huge banner at the Brandenburg Gate , on the border between the city 's Eastern and Western sectors . From all over Germany 's Russian zone , youngsters this week set out by train , bus and on foot for the long-heralded Whitsuntide demonstration in Berlin . Squads of Communist youths sneaked into West Berlin to paste up Red propaganda posters ( see cut ) . The latest pronouncement from Red Germany 's Propaganda Chief Gerhart Eisler was that the demonstration would be a strictly peaceful affair . But U.S. officials were not willing to take Eisler 's word for it . The U.S. had announced that it would use force , if necessary , to hold the West 's position in Berlin . <P> Possibly the Reds had actually been intimidated by this U.S. warning . Many parents in the Eastern zone , afraid that their children might come to harm in Berlin , were trying to keep them from taking part in the demonstration . There was no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to-and put the Western Allies in the embarrassing position of having to use force on German civilians , most of them mere kids ( see below ) . Whatever the Russians ' intention , on Armed Forces Day last week the U.S. showed that it was ready for trouble . <P> On Berlin 's Tempelhof Airport , which has become something of a shrine for Berliners since the airlift , the U.S. staged a large , lively show including a parade of 1,000 crack troops ( led by the 298th Army band and the 7868th fife &; drum unit ) , massed Army , Navy and Air Force colors , helicopters which performed special feats of daring , an exhibition of jets and other U.S. aircraft , and ( in the afternoon ) a baseball game . Tempelhof field was jammed by 100,000 Berliners who had turned out with baby carriages , folding chairs and lunch boxes to see the show . Star attraction proved to be the famed seven-minute silent drill of the 558th Infantry Rifle Platoon , a crack Negro outfit which used to be General Lucius Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders through intricate , breathtakingly precise evolutions that would have overwhelmed the British Grenadiers-or the Rockettes . Exclaimed one former Wehrmacht noncom : " Why , they 're practically better than the Prussians ! " <P> On the reviewing stand with U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy were General Thomas T. Handy , commander of U.S. forces in Europe , and other high officials , who had pointedly come to stay in Berlin through Whitsuntide . The Germans appreciated the point , were tremendously cheered by the display . U.S. strength might or might not give pause to the Reds next Sunday ; whatever happened , they could not say that they had not been warned of America 's determination to stand its ground in Berlin .
