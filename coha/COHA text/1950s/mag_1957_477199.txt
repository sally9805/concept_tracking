DWIGHT Macdonald is not very well known as a political writer ; in fact , until his fairly recent profiles and reviews for the New Yorker and his book on the Ford Foundation he was probably not very well known as a writer of any kind . The reasons for his lack of popular reputation are not difficult to guess . His earlier work appeared in magazines of limited circulation and distinctly highbrow readership , much of it in his own one-man magazine , Politics , an always lively and often brilliant venture now defunct . More important , for most of his career he has occupied a highly unpopular political position , and until the middle ' forties a good deal of his energy went into internecine intellectual warfare among lett-wing splinter groups , a kind of activity that is likely to strike a reader only moderately addicted to politics as a debate about how many angels can dance on the end of Karl Marx 's beard , which it often was . Yet there are not many contemporary American political journalists who could assemble a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entertaining and enlightening as Macdonald 's new collection , The Memoirs of a Revolutionist ( Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy , $4.75 ) . Most of the pieces in the book were written as comments on passing events " during the second world war and soon thereafter , when Macdonald was a pacifist and " libertarian socialist " ( i.e. , an anti-Stalinist Marxist ) . Now he has given up both pacific:ism and socialism ; as he explains in a fine autobiographical introduction , his present political views are not very different from anybody else 's , and consequently he is no longer much interested in politics . But in spite of their abandoned ideological platform and the retreat into the past of the specific events that provided their occasions , Macdonald 's essays are still very much worth reading . The reason for their continued vitality lies in Macdonald 's concern with style . He is a fine writer himself , with wit and point and color , and a general verbal cleanliness and suppleness thatare the more remarkable in view of his long exposure to the tattle-tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not only Macdonald 's gift ; it has also been , beneath the various sectarian political labels he has worn , his commitment . This is most obvious in his occasional pieces on writers for whom he has political sympathy and literary antipathy ; he never lets his sympathy dull the edge of his criticism , and never disguises the fact that where there is bad writing he suspects that there is bad politics too . He is particularly adroit in locating the flabbiness in liberal-progressive writing . An example is the funny and penetrating brief essay written in 1947 analyzing Henry Wallace 's prose . " Wallaceland is the mental habitat of Henry Wallace plus a few hundred thousand readers of the New Republic , the Nation , and PM , " Macdonald begins . " It is a region of perpetual fogs , caused by the warm winds of the liberal Gulf Stream coming in contact with the Soviet glaciers . Its natives speak Wallese , ' a debased provincial dialect . . . as rigidly formalized as Mandarin Chinese . " And he goes on to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its clutter of dead imagery reveals about the man and the program he once advocated . In an era in which we have been repeatedly assured that it is deeds not words that count in politics , Macdonald 's concern with style may seem trifling , the dilettantism of a literary critic who through some mistake set to work on the wrong texts . Yet the fundamental problem of style , the problem of establishing the relationship between means and ends , is by no means an insignificant problem in politics , and it is Macdonald 's conviction that there must be a harmony between means and ends that defines his moral , political , and literary outlook and provides the unity of his book . " I have maintained , " he said in an article written in 1945 when his affair with the Socialist Workers party was coming to an end , " that the question of words masks front himself his own emptiness and passiveness . That does not make him an uninteresting specimen of humanity , but it does make it difficult to take him at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic and pathetic and criminal possibilities , but whether he has heroic possibilities is another question . You can imagine him as small-town clerk or student in Chekhov , who makes a career out of noisily complaining about the dullness of provincial life and would have to split his throat if he really got a chance to go to Paris . Or you can imagine him as a perpetually wrathful drunk in a play by Sean O'CaSey , whose gift of ill-natured gab is always good for a laugh at the neighborhood bar . Or you can imagine him as a ready recruit for a fascist gang , too passive to provide his own excitement and too bored and angry to turn down any offer of violence that conies along . Look Back in Anger is curiously constructed , as any play has to be if it is dominated by an essentially passive character . Jimmy Porter 's part consists of a long outraged soliloquy ( a remarkable feat of writing ) while the action runs along more or less irrelevantly beside it . His wife leaves , another woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife returns , the other woman moves out ? that is the story ; all the action arises from decisions made by the other characters , while Jimmy goes on talking . For such a character to be a hero he must he like a rock that the waves buffet but can not move : Jimmy Porter is more like a buoy , with no solid base and no object except to make a constant unpleasant noise as a warning that under the surface there is something dangerous . T H E young men and women who populate Jack Kerouac 's On the Road itch in about the same place as Jimmy Porter , but the difference between him and them is that where they itch they scratch . There is nothing passive about them ; they are out to live it up , and they do . By any conventional moral standard they are a bad lot ? a bunch of overage juvenile delinquents who steal , take drugs , sleep around , and use language that they never learned by reading valentines . Their adventures are too hectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " crazy , " to make a story : they drive cars ( not always their own ) or hitchhike or take buses across the country , go on wild parties , have brief tempestuous love affairs , occasionally even work whey all else fails . Yet they are really religious trays tics of a sort , admittedly an odr sort . They believe that " life is hoh and every moment is precious , " ant they are trying , through the ex tremes of sensation ( sex , drugs , jazz ) to find union with something be you 'd sensation , which they designat , simply as IT ( " Man , you 're reall with it " ) . They have something common with some of the weirdc religious cults of nineteenth-centur America : they want to howl , figfr and tear the place apart to the glor of life ? Holy Rollers with hot-ro cars and Benzedrine . They are Isar and soft at the same time ; a typict term of praise in Kerouac 's vocabt Lary would be " a sweet and lovab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bad writing , and K rouac 's book has most of the cha acteristic faults . In places it is pr tentious and sentimental , and it h : its share of crackpottery and woo ; ness . Kerouac is capable of writh phrases like " the potent and inco ceivable mind essences shining bright Mind Essence , " which may may not mean something . He is al long-winded and terribly earnest ; 1 book and Osborne 's play togeth suggest that whatever else the pr , ent younger generation may strong in , its sense of humor is feel indeed . Yet On the Road has a good di more to say than the 297th no ' about a vice president who wants be a president or the 410th no ' about decadence on the old plan tion . There is vigor in the bo ? and a wide-openness to experier that keeps it alive . It is not recc mended to the squeamish , exo those who are given to deplor : conformity in American life ; ti deserve what they will get . Incidentally , Kerouac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story in San Francisco So istics like aggression . We tend to shun the divisiveness of ideas and to cultivate the feelings that unite . ( Macdonald , in Mrs. Scott-Maxwell 's terms , would be a masculine writer , with his incisive wit and intellectual approach to problems , but the younger writers just discussed , with their emphasis on feeling , would illustrate the " feminization of society . " But these writers are too apt to Mrs. Scott-Maxwell 's theory ; many earlier writers ? Charles Dickens , for example ? have advocated in their works values that she would call feminine . ) It is not very clear just what Mrs. Scott-Maxwell would have women do to regain their sexual definition ; apparently she believes that the most they can do is to understand what has happened to them and learn to live with it . Probably the only alternative open to women is the emancipation of men , which they ould never tolerate . Mrs. Scott-Maxwell is hersel F a very feminine writer . She starts on a subject , drops it , goes back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oracular in tune and , like most oracular utterances , not very clear in meaning . Sometimes she makes observations so obvious that it is hard to believe that anyone would go to the trouble to write them down . She has a disagreeable way of nudging the reader with rhetorical questions . But just when you decide that she will never get on with it she says something very intelligent , very shrewd , very wise . Her book is probably intended chiefly for a female audience , but it never does any harm to know what they are plotting in the other camp . STAR AND CRESCENT N 0 T all the world has entered into a postrevolutionary period , and in Islam Inflamed ( Pantheon , $5 ) James Morris portrays a large region where revolution is either too recent to have lost its glamor , as in Egypt , or still an ambiguous promise for tomorrow , as in much of the rest of the Mohammedan Middle East . Within the large and varied territory that stretches from Egypt to Iran there are still plenty of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there arestill women kept in such strict purdah that they are not even permitted to go up on the roof to see the view ( no loss of sexual definition for them ) . Morris has spent many years in the Middle East as correspondent for the London Times and Manchester Guardian , and he was on Sinai during the fighting over Suez . His book is primarily an attempt to explain the Arab background of the crisis , though fortunately he does not limit himself to the problems of the moment but ranges over all aspects of Middle Eastern life . He is a wonderful travel writer , full of arresting information , with a sharp eye and a quick wit . On almost every page he shows a gift for phrase , as when he speaks of Lebanon as " an oasis of gifted commercialism set in a desert of power politics , " or recalls the former owners of the Crescent Hotel who used to describe their hostelry " with telling ambiguity as ' the only one of its kind in Aden , ' " or recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haman alKhalifa , was " once unkindly ( but accurately ) likened . . . to Miss Elsa Maxwell in fancy dress , " or remembers the Sudanese Cabinet Minister who said that the duty of the press was " to produce thrilling , attractive , and good news , coinciding where possible with the truth . " Morris covers Communism , oil , Nasser , Americans , and the rest of the mixed blessings that have come to the Middle East in recent years ; he goes from country to country sketching the atmosphere and aspirations of each , whether it is " the shadowy territory of Qishn , " which is " practically unknown , all but uninhabited , subject to a testy Sultan called Isa bin Ali bin Afrur of Hadibu , and has no kind of administration whatever , " or Iraq with its bold dream of using its oil millions to build an advanced modern society in the ancient river valleys . Islam . Inflamed is considerably less violent than its title suggests ; in fact it is rather leisurely , and altogether delightful . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect book for the reader who has some trouble in telling the Sultan of Muscat from the Iman of Oman , or even for one who has never been quite sure that Iraq is not a misprint for Iran ( which Morris helpfully calls Persia ) ; for Morris has the ability not only to give individuality to the leaders and lands he deals with but also to make them seem worth remembering . Yet Islam Inflamed is no primer ; a reader would have to be very learned not to profit ruin it and very jaded not to feel its charm . FICTION , MOSTLY LIGHT MOST of the new novels that have come this way in recent weeks do not require the heavy artillery of criticism , though some of them are at least moderately amusing . Leonard Drohan 's Come with Me to Macedonia ( Knopf , $3.95 ) , for example , is an entertaining comedy about bureaucracy . The leading character is a young government worker who has mastered the art of staying out of trouble to the point where he can expect the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , under the influence of a beautiful new secretary who convinces him that he is a prisoner of apathy with nothing to lose but his red tape , he becomes bold , imaginative , decisive ? and a notorious troublemaker . The best things in the book are the portraits of various bureaucratic types , both civilian and military ; the poorest thing is the " love story , " which a judicious reader can skip . MAX SHULMAN is the Mack Sennett of the novel : he proceeds on the principle that if you have enough pretty girls , clowns , pratfalls , and exploding cigars in a book , and keep everything moving fast enough , the reader will not have a chance to be bored . His latest effort , Rally Round the Flag , Boys ! ( Doubleday , $3.50 ) , does not disprove his theory . This is the story of what happens to a Connecticut commuters ' town when it becomes a guided-missiles site and the servicemen move in . The book is farce at its crudest and broadest , written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often genuinely funny . WALTER MACKEN 'S Sullivan ( Macmillan , $3.95 ) is the story of a poor boy from an Irish slum who wants to be an actor . As he grows up he performs in local amateur theatricals and a provincial road company , then he moves on to Dublin and London , and finally he achieves success in New York . But wealth and fame , alas , go to Sullivan 's head , and soon he is neglecting his faithful friend who has stood by him in every adversity since boyhood ; he even begins to forget his sweet little wife who has had to stay back home in Ireland to take care of her poor old grandfather . When he is just about to take a fatal misstep with the actress who plays opposite him , his friend makes the final sacrifice of getting himself shot . Then the shock of it recalls Sullivan from base temptation to his true nature , his wife is flown in from Ireland by chartered dens ex rnachina , and they arc reunited finally at the bedside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this book and reality is largely coincidental . I N The Weather of February ( Harper , $150 ) Hollis Summers has produced a slight but civilized novel . It is presented in the form of a memoir written by a woman of forty who is laid up with a broken pelvis in Mexico . To while away the time she sets down what she remembers of her parents and girlhood in a Kentucky parsonage , her days at college , and her short-lived marriage to an instructor there , her second marriage to a prosperous but otherwise unattractive hanker , and various incidental adventures . She is an amiable creature , with considerable humor and insight and a pleasantly practical approach to the people and problems that have come her way . Although The Weather of February shows the influence of Joyce Cary and suffers by comparison with Herself Surprised , it has its own quality and freshness . THERE is some doubt whether Evelyn Waugh 's new book , The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold ( Little , Brown , $3.75 ) is a novel or not . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " a conversation piece , " and a prefatory note declares that it is a slice of autobiography . But no one need be kept from reading the book by this confusion about its genre , for there are much better reasons for refraining . Waugh starts off with a chapter called " Portrait of the Artist in Middle Age , " a very elegantly written and not notably unflattering account of himself ( under the name of Gilbert Pinfold ) and how he normally lives and works . Then he tells how Pinfold suffered a collapse and decided to go abroad for his health , and most of the book is the story of what happened to him on his travels . Because of unwise medication and possibly other circumstances , the traveler soon begins to suffer hallucinations of a most unpleasant sort ? his fellow-passengers call him horrible names , keep him awake with hideous music , and plot against his comfort and even his life in a variety of ways . Finally he has to return to England , and there his hallucinations stop . Waugh apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader unfamiliar with the murkier recesses of abnormal psychology is no better off , though he may have his dark suspicions . Waugh tells it all in a sprightly way , as if it could not fail to please , but the whole thing is too nasty , too long-drawn-out , and too pointless to be a joke , and too denatured to be anything else . SINCE several of the chapters have been published in national magazines and other advance publicity has been copious , it is hardly necessary to review The King Ranch by Tom Lea and others ( Little , Brown , two volumes boxed , $17.50 ) except to say that it is pretty much as advertised . It is all extremely Texan . Physically the two volumes are big and handsome and open-faced , with lavish use of color in the printing and many excellent illustrations and maps by Torn Lea . His text is uncritical , full of the pride of accomplishment , and very engaging , Even when he is handing out words of praise to innumerable faithful employees at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that money can buy , there are extensive scholarly notes and about twenty appendixes by specialists on all kinds of subjects related to ranching in South Texas , from early Spanish and Mexican land grants to oil development . The King Ranch is the General Motors of American agriculture , or perhaps it would be more accurate to liken it to Ford , since control of the enormous enterprise ( nearly a million acres in Texas , now augmented by holdings in Kentucky , Cuba , and elsewhere ) has been strictly a family affair . It was started by Richard King , a New York apprentice who ran away to sea as a boy and laid the foundation of his fortune as a captain on the South Texas rivers during the Mexican War . Now it is in the hands of King 's descendants through his daughter Alice and her husband Robert J. Kleberg , who inanaged the ranch during the long widowhood of Mrs. Richard King , Although statistics show that there are a good many large agricultural enterprises in America , they are not very well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and industrial enterprises . There ought to he sufficient interest to support other works of this sort . Perhaps they would be improved in some respects by greater independence ? The King Ranch is obviously " official " history , solicitous of the feelings of the family ? but it dramatically calls attention to an aspect of American life heretofore too little known .
