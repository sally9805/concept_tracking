HOMAGE TO CATALONIA ( 232 pp. ) - George Orwell - Harcourt , Brace ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> In December 1936 , a 33-year-old Englishman named Eric Blair arrived in Barcelona to have a look at Spain 's civil war and write some pieces about it . A radical in politics and an antiFascist , he decided to fight instead , and enlisted in a militia outfit . Seven months later , badly used up and sporting the scars of a near-fatal bullet hole through his neck , he went back to England and wrote a book about his experience . It was not a popular book because it was antiCommunist , and the fashion then was to cheer the Communist-controlled " Popular Front " that was running Spain . In the U.S. , the book was n't published at all . It was a pity , because Homage to Catalonia was an eye-opener . It makes fine reading even now , published here at last because Eric Blair , who died two years ago ( TIME , Feb. 6 , 1950 ) wrote under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nineteen Eighty-Four ) Orwell . <P> Meaningless Bullets . Orwell showed what has since become clear even to U.S. liberals , that the Communists used Spain 's civil war for their own purposes , worked as hard to destroy their Loyalist allies as they did to defeat Franco . But today the best of Homage to Catalonia is its crisply accurate description of men at war . <P> Some of the militiamen in Orwell 's outfit were mere children , all were badly trained , few knew how to fire a rifle . Orwell , who had once been a policeman in Burma , was appalled when he was handed his weapon , an 1896 German Mauser with a corroded barrel . Assigned to a section on the Aragon front , his ragged company of 100 went into the trenches with twelve overcoats among them . Before long , Orwell had learned the basic fact of infantry life : boredom . Wrote he : " A life as uneventful as a city clerk 's and almost as regular . Sentry-go , patrols , digging ; digging , patrols , sentry-go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ragged , dirty men shivering round their flag and trying to keep warm . And all day and night the meaningless bullets wandering across the empty valleys and only by some rare improbable chance getting home on a human body . " <P> The Deeper Wound . The improbable chance caught up with Orwell when a sniper winged him . But for a man of his intense integrity the deeper wound came when he went back to Barcelona on sick leave . To his horror he discovered that the Communists , now firmly in the saddle , considered him a Fascist because he had served in a non-Communist unit . Faced with arrest , he had to sleep in the streets , found himself a criminal in the country he had come to fight for . His disgust exceeding his fear , Orwell crossed the border into France , wrote what is still the best book on the Spanish civil war .
