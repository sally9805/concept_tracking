TIME : It is probably between the hours of nine ( 9 ) AM and eleven ( 11 ) , on a Sunday morning of the third season , this present time . PLACE : A northern New Jersey town in the Metropolitan district . The entire action of the play unfolds in the living room , dining room and front lawn of the home of Mr. and Mrs Joseph Baxter . The Baxters ' home was built about five years ago , two years prior to Mr. Baxter being appointed as a district sales manager for Carne-Ashley-Carne liquor distributors . The living room is a very large one with a fire place built into the side of the wall facing the street . Overhead the mantle is a large portrait of Anna Baxter 's mother . Directly beneath the portrait is a trumpet attached to the wall . The mantle piece is populated by a trophy at each corner of the piece , and in the center is a vase of wilted red roses . There is a window to the left and right of the mantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide space between the right window and fire place . This space is leased to a radio-phono-television combination set . Towards the center of the floor rests a medium low couch , angular and away from the left of the fire place . To the left end of the couch is a table for the phone , and directly in front center is a large marble top table with the customary ash tray , fruit bowl , etc . To the right angular position of the couch are two subtly hinted period chairs . Directly in the far left corner is a modern type Spinet piano . p. 3 The back wall to the left of the piano leads to the study . In the study is another long couch , a desk slanted to the center of the area . The two walls are represented by double decked library shelves . The two shelves from the right side leads to another level past the stairway into the dining room . To the right of the stairway is the dining room 's china cabinet . To this side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five feet away to the center of the dining room is the a large square table where dinner is served . Just to the right corner away from the table is the room 's phone extension against the wall . As it is said , this room is one level higher than the living room . At any instance , a person may step down , turn right , and there is the door leading to the front of the house and lawn . The core of the lawn is centered more to the left of the house . The lawn is wide , the grass is very green with it 's summer tables and chairs placed in purposeful spots . There are hedges by the front of the house , with flowers growing at the base . There is a walkway leading off to the left and directly to the street . It would be more feasible for this setting to be raked. @x Flora steps from the stairway into the dining room with a bottle of scotch whiskey in one hand and a pair of shears in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , walks away , stops , returns to the table , picks the bottle up and drinks from it . She slams the bottle down on the table , shaking her head , coughing and making blowing noises with her mouth . She hurriedly caps the bottle and places it at the bottom of china cabinet . She darts out into the living room , moving directly to the vase of dead roses on the mantle piece . She takes the dead flowers from the vase and drops them into the waste basket at the base of the fire place . She puts her nose to the water , frowns , looks about to see if anyone is watching , but unknown to her , a young caucasian boy in his early twenties is spying on her from the window . She prances ou of the room and onto the lawn , placing the vas on one of the tables . She then proceeds to clip an assortment of flowers at the base of t hedges . She is humming snatches of a tune she is not too familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens . She is shapely , wit bony archaic features . There is an adolescent sophisticated air about her , an awkward knowin quality , with a shift of dynamic melancholy . CONTE ( Jumping out from the side of the house . ) Uhh , huh ! I caught you ! Live roses in stale water is a piece of news I 'm sure Mrs Baxter would like to know about . p. 5 FLORA ( Turning to him abruptly . ) You ! CONTE Yep , alive and kicking to beat a parade band . . . FLORA Go ahead and tell , stool pigeon ! CONTE Would n't think of it , little apple . . . FLORA You got nothing better to do with your time than to go around spying on your next door neighbors ? CONTE ( Moving towards her . ) Good morning , little apple ! FLORA Good morning ! And I mind to tell you , I am not a piece of fruit , I 'm a teenager ! CONTE ( As he comes within arm 's reach , he grabs her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and kisses her . ) And a gorgeous one at that . . . ( He moves away quickly . ) When are you gon na grow up so I can do that for real ? FLORA ( Placing the roses she has already clipped into the vase on the table . ) Mother ever catch you kissing me , it 's not goin ' to matter one way or the other . CONTE Now that I can believe . . . FLORA ( Moving back towards the hedges . ) What brings you over here so early anyway ? p. 6 CONTE Have n't you guessed ? FLORA ( Bending to clip the flowers . ) I guess so . . . CONTE Well , did he come in ? FLORA Got in about two this morning . . . CONTE And he did n't call me , what that- ( Heading for the door leading into the house . ) FLORA ( Rising ) Wait ! CONTE ( Stopping at the door . ) Yes ? FLORA They 're all in there getting ready for church , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bustin ' in . CONTE ( Turning , walking away from the door . He moves to the center of the lawn and sits on one of the large chiars . ) Since when did everybody around here get so church going happy ? FLORA ( Clipping the flowers . ) We go twice a year . . . Every last one of us ! Except for Daddy and the cat . . . Course the cat do n't need anybody 's church , he 's in heaven already with the good treatment we give him . CONTE . . . Three years and old Calder 's home for good , with a turned around collar on his neck . . . p. 7 FLORA ( Moving to the table to place a cluster of flowers in the vase . ) That 's what Mother says . . . Of course , Mother says everything . CONTE I ca n't believe it . . . FLORA You might as well , and there 's no need for you to come over here with all that jazz talk ; Mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minister , his only place is in the church . CONTE Your mother says everything ! FLORA ( Making a motion towards him . ) I do n't play that boy ! CONTE Aw , be yourself Flora . . . Anyway , if there 's anyone to stir up something , it certainly wo n't be me . . . Which means , I do n't think that three short years in some divinity college has changed his feeling about music . FLORA ( She returns to clipping the flowers . ) Well , all I can say is that Mother 's got her foot down , and when Mother puts her foot down , it 's usually in somebody 's face . CONTE ( Rising , moving away as if he is about to leave . . . ) I did n't come over here to argue about the weight of your mother 's feet . . . FLORA ( Rises , moves swiftly to him . . . ) Everybody keeps telling m e I talk too much . Do I ? p. 8 CONTE ( Stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do , but you 're sweet . . . FLORA Honestly ? CONTE ( Crosses his heart . ) To heaven . . . FLORA You did n't have to do that ; I believe you . CONTE ( Checks his watch . ) Time 's come , got ta be off now . . . FLORA Do n't go now . . . ( She grabs him by the arm and pulls him back to one of the big chairs . . . ) . . . Sit and talk to me for awhile . . . CONTE About what ! ? FLORA ( Forcing him down into the chair . ) . . . About that band you 're going away to play with . CONTE I 'm not going . I play with a group in New York now . Which reminds me , I saw your brother Frank last night . FLORA ( Walks away from him . ) I bet he was drunk too . . . CONTE No he was n't . . . FLORA Do n't tell me . He was drunk when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause ) You really love Frank , do n't you ? p. 9 FLORA ( Turning to him ) I do Conte , I really do . You may not believe this , but you , Frank and Daddy are the only people I trust myself talking to . . . Like when I 'm serious . Whenever I try to talk to Mother and Virge about realyimportant things , they do n't listen . . . So I try to make them laugh , but you know what they do ? They scold me . . . They call me a clown . Am I a clown Conte ? CONTE No Flora , you 've got the most beautiful teenager 's soul I know of . . . free from rock n ' roll , movie star adulation , moon june crooners , the whole she-bang and that 's a lot to say about a person . . . FLORA Thanks . . . CONTE What about Calder ? How do you feel about him ? FLORA He 's alright , I guess . But you ca n't figure him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to him , he does n't look at you , even when he 's staring you right straight in the eye . I used to think he was crazy or something . . . Anyway , I did n't think Mother was right in making go off to be a preacher when he did n't want to . But as for Frank , I think he 's goin ' to be a genius someday . . . He says things that big college professors would n't think of . CONTE He 's got quite a mind , I must admit that . . . FLORA And you know something ? They 're all my half sisters and brothers , but believe me , they act it all the time , except Frank , of course . Frank is always Frank . Even Mother knows that . She thought she was goin ' to make a lawyer out of him . . . you remember that , but he told her just like it was . . . I mean he practically told her to go to hell . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Calder , she took his trumpet from him and nailed it to that wall in there . . . with her own private hammer . . . her own private nails . CONTE ( Rises to leave . ) That 's a real sad thing . ( Walks away . ) FLORA ( Following him . ) Call it what you like , but I never heard a preacher blowing a trumpet in a nightclub . CALDER ( A young man in his twenties about 5 ' 9 in height is standing in the doorway leading to the lawn . He is dressed in cardigan sweater , open white shirt and black trousers . ) Do n't make any bets on that Flora ! ( Leaping out onto the yard . ) CONTE ( Turning quickly ) CALDER ( Extending his hand ) Conte Renzulli . . . What you say ! CONTE ( Shaking his hand ) I say it 's great to see you baby ! CALDER ( Looking him over ) You 're looking well . . . CONTE It 's a struggle , but I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeh , everybody tries , dammit ! p. 11 FLORA Ai n't you something . . . You suppose to be a preacher and you talking like that . . . CALDER ( Goes to Flora and embraces her ) You know something Conte . . . I have the most beautiful , the kindest , the most mannered , the most intelligent and sweetest little sister in all the State of New Jersey . . . Asleep , that is . ( Flora pushes him away ) CONTE She told me you were in the house getting ready for . . . Say . . . you do n't look like you 're going to any church to me . . . . CALDER ( Stands up on the table and looks out towards the street . . . ) I am going down that hill . . . and I shall walk and walk and walk until the sun becomes too much for me to take . . . Then I 'll find myself a tree to sit under . . . Then I 'll wipe the perspiration from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath and ask myself the simple question : How in hell could the good lord allow good people to sit up in some stuffy old church on such a beautiful day as today ! ( Leaps down from the table . ) CONTE Well , I 'm due to make eleven o'clock mass myself , but I 'll tell what , I 'll buy what you say and go along with you . CALDER I 'm starting a new movement ; come Flora . . . p. 12 FLORA You 'll start it without me . . . CALDER Let 's make it Conte . . . CONTE Bye , little apple . . . ( The two boys rush off . ) FLORA ( Pause ) ' Bye . . . ( She stands in one place for awhile , when suddenly she hears the phone ringing in the living room . She rushes in and picks up the receiver . ) Hello , Baxter residence . . . Oh , hi Karl . . . Alright . . . Wait , I 'll call her for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushes to the base of the stairs . . . ) Pick up Virge ! Virge ! ( She waits for a moment , then returns to the phone , picks it up to her ear , thereby realizing Virge has not responded to her call . Disgusted , she runs across the room to the piano and bangs a loud cluster on the keyboard . ) VIRGE ! ( She turns , notices her mother standing at the top of the level in the dining room . She walks properly to the base of the stairs and calls gently . . . ) Virge . . . ANNA Who do you think you 're fooling with that bull , Flora ? ( Goes to the china cabinet , takes the bottle of scotch from the bottom and a small glass from the top , pours herself a light drink and places the bottle on the table . She is in her early fifties , yet she looks much younger . It is not affected or strained . She is not weighted , her hair has not greyed , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong with you ? You know your father is trying to sleep . p. 13 FLORA It 's Karl , Mother . He wants Virge on the phone . ANNA I 'm glad you told me . I would n't have known otherwise . ( Stepping out into the living room . ) Well , run along to get her . . . or tell her to pick it up whereever she may be , but no more of that screaming , you hear ? ( She is at the door looking out on the lawn . ) FLORA I 'm sorry Mother . I guess I just felt that way . ( Walks slowly through the exit . ) ANNA ( She steps just outside the door . ) You better hope she did n't hear you banging on her piano . ( She looks about the yard inquisitively , when suddenly she is beset by an ensuing arguement taking place between Virge and Flora . She forcefully reenters the room . ) Will you stop arguing with that girl and answer this phone Virge ! VIRGE ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenties . . . There is a cold pretentious air about her , which leaves one uncertain as to her overall nature and character . She is moving in the direction of the phone in the living room . ) I do n't know why you 're snapping at me . It was her screaming like a fool ! ANNA Never mind , just pick up your call , the boy 's been waiting long enough already . And I do n't know why you insist on taking all your calls in this room anyway . ( Virge stops in her tracks , turns , moves into the dining room and picks up the receiver. ) p. 14 ANNA ( Hanging up the living room receiver ) And do n't hang on that line all morning . . . VIRGE ( Over her shoulder . ) Do n't worry about it . FLORA You let her talk like that to you , Mother ? VIRGE Shut up ! ANNA Virge ! ( Points to Flora ) From you , I want nothing but silence ! FLORA She says SHUT UP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In a playful beckoning tone . ) Just you keep it up , my sweet little pudding , and the difference is going to be right up side your head ! FLORA What 's the difference ? ANNA ( Grabbing her by both arms and shaking her violently . . . ) For you to act your damn age ! FLORA ( Pause ) I'm- ANNA . . . . Sorry . . . ? ( Releasing her ) . . . you felt that way . . . things just pop up in your mind and you just have to speak . I 've heard it all before . . . IT 'S YOUR HONESTY . . . p. 15 FLORA ( Pause ) I do want to be honest Mother . . . ( Virge puts the receiver down and stands by disgustedly . . . ) ANNA You 're not ten now Flora , and your smart little words are n't cute anymore . . . Have n't you noticed , we stopped laughing three years ago ! FLORA I said I was- ANNA . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that ! ANNA Then not a word . . . Not one single word . I did n't bring you into this world to be a pranking , joking , clowing little colored girl , or for that matter . JUST ANOTHER LITTLE COLORED GIRL . . . We get to be friends ? FLORA We get to be friends , Mother . . . ( She sits ) ANNA If you 're finished with that phone Virge- VIRGE I am going to call him back , as soon as I 'm assured the courtesy of a little civilized behavior around here . ANNA Well just remember , I have no intention of being late for the service . FLORA Mother , am I colored ? ANNA No , you 're a grasshopper and I better not have to come back into this room . . . ( She exits briskly. ) p. 16 VIRGE ( Starts dialing on the phone . ) Get out or be quiet . . . ( Flora runs up to Virge and tries to put her ear to the phone . . . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . It 's Flora again . One of her frequent teen-tantrums . . . I do n't know , sign of the times , I suppose . . . FLORA And what a time ! ( Runs to the couch and pats it with her hand . . . . . ) Right here on this couch last night . . . ( Moves towards her in the dining room ) Thought everybody was asleep , did n't you . . . ? Well , everybody was . . . that is except me , and down those stairs I crept , I peeped , and I saw . . . . ( Waving her finger ) Shame on you Virge . . . NOW WAS N'T THAT A TIME ! VIRGE ( Puts the receiver down and goes after her . . . . . ) Come back here you little- FLORA ( Backing away ) The phone , Virge ! Your fellow on the phone ! VIRGE ( Ceasing her pursuit . ) Karl . . . Did you hear that ? Did you hear what she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't talk about that now . . . I 'll see you this evening . . . Please Karl , do n't say that . . . I 'll talk to you about it later , alright ? Good . . . ' Bye ' bye . . . ( She hangs up . ) Flora , you 're making it very hard for yourself with me. . . p. 17 FLORA ( Moving out of the door onto the lawn ) You know I was just joking . . . Everybody keeps telling me I 'm just like mother . . . ( Flora is at the lawn table fetching the vase of flowers as Virge stands just outside of the door . ) VIRGE Well I can assure you I 'm not laughing and being like mother is n't necessarily a compliment . . . FLORA ( Standing before her at the entrance . ) I bet mother would be tickled pink to hear what you just said . VIRGE ( Turning and reentering the room ) You 're becoming more American with each day , Flora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mantle . . . . ) Virge , when I go into your history class this fall , are you going to let me cheat ? VIRGE ( Standing in the dining room . ) My dear sister , when you step into my class this fall , this is one teacher you 're going to hate before it 's all over with . But by the time your exams come around , you 're going to know more history than I do . FLORA Aw Virge ! I 'll tell all the kids about how you act at home . . . I 'll tell ' em you drink ! I 'll tell ' em you 're a lush ! p. 18 VIRGE ( Ignoring Flora , she picks up the scotch bottle left on the table by Anna and proceeds toput it away . . . ) Have you been drinking from this bottle ? FLORA Who me ? Now you know I would n't do a thing like that . . . . AS YOUNG AS I AM . . . I know they say " JD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , THIS IS OUR HOME . . . VIRGE You 'll stop trying to be cute and answer me ! FLORA I 'll answer nothing to you ! ( Pause ) If I 'm no good when I grow up , I would at least like to have the pleasure of blaming it on my parents , but how could I explain you sister , and only a half sister at that ! ANNA ( Entering ) Virge , what are you doing girl , I- VIRGE Alright , I 'm going up now . . . . ( She exits briskly ) ANNA And ask Joe to come downstairs . . . I want to talk with him before we leave . . . . FLORA Mother , could I go to the movies this afternoon with Barbara ? ANNA Yes , you may . . .

Come back here ! FLORA Yes mother ? ANNA What would you like to be when you grow into a woman ? FLORA An actress . . . ANNA You 're sure it 's nothing like a grave digger , shoeshine girl , or maybe a comedian ? FLORA No mother , an actress . . . ANNA You just might make it . . . I 've known stranger things to happen . ( Joe appears at the top of the dining room level , dressed in a house robe . He is a Well preserved man in his early fifties . . . ) JOE Good morning . . .

JOE ( Releasing her from his embrace ) Now that does n't sound like old Anna to me . . . Thought for sure , that you , him and Virge would be sitting on the front row today for the whole congregation to admire . ( He moves towards the dining room . ) ANNA He 'll have plenty of that all next week . . . JOE I have never underestimated the powers of my dear wife . . . ( He exits through the kitchen door in the dining room . ) ANNA Graham called this morning . . . JOE ( He bounces back to entrance and stops . ) About what ? Why did n't I speak to him ?

JOE You 're becoming mighty considerate around here lately , Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming to visit you this afternoon . JOE I see . . . Was this his idea or yours ? ANNA There is a young man who now lives in this house . . . He is my son . . . He is a minister . . . His father was my husband and he was the founder of the church of which I'mattending today . . . You are his stepfather and you are Carne-Ashley-Carne 's most able sales-manager. p. 22 JOE What does that have to do with Cuba ? ANNA These are some of the facts he will discuss with you . . . JOE Concerning what ? ANNA The transfer and promotion . . . JOE ( He exits through the back leaving the door open . ) That ! I have told you a hundred times Anna . . . Ramsey Reynolds is not about to see himself promoting a Negro to a vice president 's job in any of his offices . . . ( He moves into the dining room with a glass of orange juice in his hand . ) So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . ANNA But Joe- JOE And if Graham is so concerned that he going to come all the way from Long Island to spend a Sunday afternoon with me , it 's to talk about how my sales have been slipping in every state in my district . . . That 's all and nothing more . . . ANNA You will not know a thing Joe until you 've put everything you have into it . . . JOE What have I got . . . I 'm not a basketball player . . . I 'm not a baseball player , a singer , a tap dancer . . . In other words , I would make the most awkward uncle tom in the world . p. 23 ANNA You do n't have to be any of those things . . . not if your own situation became a very conspicious one . . .

JOE ( Voice off stage . . . ) I 'm listening ! ANNA Tuesday night I 'm having a welcome home party for Calder . . . Graham says I should invite every important person we know in the Metropolitan area and of course a few newspaper people . . . JOE ( Returning this time with coffee and toast . . . ) Exploiting the homecoming of a young preacher in this town is n't enough to convince old man Reynolds that I deserve that promotion . And where your newspapers are concerned , I 'm not so sure if I like that idea at all . . . A lot of phonies snapping pictures all over the place . . . I 've known people to land in jail for crimes they comitted 20 years ago , just by getting their pictures in the newspapers .

Dr Ralph A Mitchell , Joe . . . one of the most important clergymen in this entire world . . . and you , a salesman with no time to spare for him . . . Graham knows about it Joe . JOE What did he say ? p. 25 ANNA He did n't say anything , but I told him that I would be making arrangements today to have Calder as the introduction speaker to Dr Mitchell . JOE I see . . . ANNA So , what do you think ? JOE I think it 's dishonest . . . ANNA Dishonest ? JOE That 's right . . . I 've been a liquor salesman for fifteen years , and a damn good one too , but not one time in those fifteen years did I ever have to stoop to a lot of phony humbuggery to sell a few bottles of whiskey , and I do n't see any neccessity for it now .

I want me some neck bones the next time you cook a meal in this house . . . I can hear that fat ass Margaret Anderson now . . . ( Mocking ) . . .My mother was a full blooded Cherokee indian ! I see them every day , on the job , on the buses , the street , breaking their hearts down to nothing , trying to prove to Mr Charley they 're ladies and gentlemen .

It 's natural , because it goes with getting on with the job , keeping it , holding on to what you got , and getting what you do n't have . . . It 's life , whether you 're black or white , and I 'm doing what goes with it , what 's necessary , what I 've always done since the day we were married . . . and I 'm going to continue to do it . . .

ANNA ( Breaking away for the door . . . ) Let 's just-say you 're a fool Joe Baxter , a born fool ! JOE Anna ! ANNA ( Stopping at the door and turning . . . ) Joe- JOE Alright ! ( Pause ) You go ahead and have your parties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the job , Calder , Reynolds , Graham , everything , but let me say one thing to you . . . I am going to be but so many fools as long as I 'm paying the rent in this house . . . ANNA Why- VIRGE ( Rushing in through the back door . . . ) Mother please , we 're going to be late ! ANNA ( Pause ) Good day Joe . . . ( She exits by the front door . . . ) ( Virge exits through the kitchen door ) JOE Good day . . . ( He looks far off and beyond a corner of the room with swift and heavy thought . He goes to the couch , sits , then falls to his back . . . ) GOOD DAY ! C-U-R-T-A-I-N p. 29 Act 1 , Scene 2 About an hour later . . . Graham , a young caucasian man about thirty five years in age is seated at one of the tables on the lawn , sipping from a glass . Joe is passing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large pair of shears . He stops momentarily to look on Frank who is sleeping on the couch . He proceeds to join Graham on the lawn . JOE ( Stepping before Graham . . . ) I hope you do n't mind Graham , but if I do n't take care of these hedges , no one else will . . . GRAHAM Not at all , you go right ahead . . . JOE ( Bending before the hedges . . . ) I just hope these shears are in good shape . . . GRAHAM You know this drink here is just about the best thing I 've tasted in ages . . . JOE Glad you like it . . . GRAHAM What 's it made of . . . ? I think I taste that old vodka sting . . . JOE You win the money . . . It 's a well calculated mixture of vodka and blackberry liquer . . . GRAHAM Your recipe . . . ? JOE Oh no , something my stepson Frank made up . . . p. 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the big schools in New England . was n't he ? JOE Yes , that is until he decided he knew more than the instructors . GRAHAM Is he working ? JOE No . . . GRAHAM You think he might prove to be of some value in the office ? JOE I believe he would and I 've been at him about it , but he keeps telling me that work is the most malignant and degenerate cancer in modern day society . . . GRAHAM One of those types , I see . . . Well what does he want to do with his life ? JOE Who knows . . . He says he 's a writer , and I suppose he is. . . at least he talks like one . . . It 's the only thing that can keep him in the house for any length of time . . . GRAHAM I 'm sorry to hear that Joe . . . But then again , you 've got a lot to be proud of in Calder . . . JOE ( Rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud . . . CALDER ( Entering upon the lawn from the outside . . . ) Hi Joe . . . JOE Well . . . You certainly got up with the day . . . p. 31 CALDER You know me . . . JOE You know Calder , do n't you Graham . . . ? GRAHAM ( Extending his hand . . . ) Of course . . . Congratulations to you Calder . . . CALDER ( Pause ) Thank you . . . ( Pause ) Thank you . . . ( Pause ) Well , I guess I better be getting inside . . . See you later Joe , wanta have a little talk with you . . . JOE Sure . . . CALDER Good seeing you again Mr Graham . . . . ( He enters the house . . . ) GRAHAM Same here Calder . . . ! ( Pause ) Fine young man , Joe . . . ( He opens up his brief case . . . ) When you have a moment Joe , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE You did n't come all the way over here for that . . . I 've been in this business long enough to know that all charts can wait at least for a day . . . . GRAHAM Ca n't fool old Joe Baxter , can I ? JOE What is it Graham ? GRAHAM Well , I had to have this little talk with you sooner or later . The question was how to go about it . . . p. 32 JOE Talk . . . I see . . . GRAHAM It 's not just you . . . I 'll be getting around to the others in the next two weeks . . . JOE What others , McDowell , Roberts . . . ? GRAHAM Roberts ? He and his jokes all the damn time . When you see Roberts telling a joke , you see him from the day he was born until the day he dies . . . You ever wondered why I selected you to give my reports at the monthly board meetings ? JOE I have . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in that office ca n't read . . . Of course , there are times when I wonder how some of them ever learned . Nevertheless , the reports are always down on paper . . . Markets , areas , distributions . . . same old stuff . . . But when you sound off to read them , there is a tone , a flavor , a color that grips that entire room . Man , there is a color to everything you do and say . JOE Now that is the truth . . . GRAHAM You are possesssed of the kind of qualities I definitely admire ina man . . . especially in a man older than myself . . . A man whose life seems to take on a new interest with each day . . . JOE Keep talking . . . GRAHAM I say these things , well look at me . I am thirty six years old . . . Good job . . . at the office by ten . . . home by seven . . . Take in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't like plays , except musicals and comedies . . . We have friends at the house once or twice a week , and the usual thing always happens ; they have one too many drinks , with the women trying to imitate Katherine Hepburn , and the men . . . they start in singing those damn barbershop songs . . . p. 33 JOE Judging from your tone , I would presume you 're not too happy with all that . . . GRAHAM Not being happy with it , is a mild term . . . Man . . . I am just tired . . . So tired , it drives me to things I regret very deeply after it 's done . . . ( Pause ) By that expression on your face , I know exactly what your next question will be . . . . . . Yes , there was a girl . . . She was an actress in a Broadway show . I was very fond of her too . . . I had some real life in me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , your wife caught you . . . GRAHAM How did you know ? JOE The " expression " was on your face . . . GRAHAM Yes , she did . . . but strangely enough , she was most understanding about the matter . She just simply advised me on to the parish priest . . . and told me not to do it again . . . JOE And did you ? GRAHAM No Joe , when you have a woman as good as my Rosalie , it 's a real pain to lie to her , I mean it . . . Then again , it 's no fun living your life out in confession boxes . . . JOE . . . Along with the thought , that if you can play doll house with broadway actresses , she can play postoffice with mail carriers . . . p. 34 GRAHAM Oh no , Rosalie would n't do a thing like that , no matter what I did . JOE You 're a damn fool Graham . . . GRAHAM Or I 'm just too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the youngest vice president CAC ever had , I 'm a first man , but when I 'm out of that office , I 'm empty , blank . . . JOE You 're damn positive whenever my sales start to drop , at home , in the office or mountain climbing in outer Mongolia . . . GRAHAM I 'm talking about things that are whole and total in a man . . . The kind of man you are . . . inseparable from your work , your wife , your home , your children , your position in this community . . . JOE If I 'm all that great , why do n't we change jobs ? GRAHAM There you go again , right up on top of everything I say . I know you would like to have a desk like mine and I do n't blame you . . . It 's a good desk Joe . . . JOE Alright , you 've been hinting around long enough . . . I know Dawson retires at the end of the year . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in Chicago is wide open . . . for the best man in my office . . . JOE You 're a cruel bastard if you 're leading me on Graham . . . p. 35 GRAHAM I can sincerely say , that old man Reynolds has spoken to me twice in the past month concerning you and that position , and I told him you were the best man we have . . . JOE Dawson told me he was leaving six months ago , and I never thought about it . . . It was out of the question . GRAHAM Never underestimate the economical fluctuations of free enterprise man . . . Do n't you think that Reynolds is aware of the fact that for the past fifteen years the Negro buying power has outgrown any other national groupings in this country . . . Just think what would happen if CAC decided to make you one of our vice presidents . . . You know how your colored newspapers and magazines carry on whenever something like that happens . . . Why we would have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this entire nation . Our competitors would be hopeless in those areas . You see the logic ? JOE Yes , but what would happen in all those little white communities " across the nation " ? GRAHAM We would n't play it up in the regular papers . . . You can understand that . . . It 's not that our other customers would n't like it , but why blind them by shoving it in their faces JOE A hell of a way to consider a man for a job , but you 've got me thinking about it , so much I can almost taste it . Do you realize what this would mean for a man like me ? Joe Baxter , vice president for Carne-Ashley-Carne. . . p. 36 GRAHAM It 's true I told Reynolds you were nothing short when it came to handling sales , but then he asked to see your three month chart report . . . I had to stall him Joe . . . JOE I know my sales are down now . . . It 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double my highest peak . GRAHAM I know it , but Reynolds does n't . . . Look Joe , the way Reynolds thinks about salesmen and lost accounts , is that there is a definite reason for it . . . That 's all he thinks . . . He pays me to find out what that " definite reason " is and to do something about it . . . In your case , he does n't know a damn thing yet . . . That 's why I 'm here , to clean it up before he does . . . ( He goes into his bag and pulls out a newspaper clipping . . . ) So let 's put our heads together and find out where you 've been slipping . ( Holds out a newspaper clipping to Joe . . . . ) Could this be it ? ( Pause ) You mind if I read it ? JOE No . . . Go ahead . . . . GRAHAM It 's a little piece in one of those same colored papers I was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads . . . ) " The Baxters of Northfield finds it quite difficult these days to attend affairs overpopulated by fellow Negroes . " I have another one here that- p. 37 JOE I do n't wanta hear it ! GRAHAM ( Pause ) I spoke to Anna this morning . . . She understands . . . You 've got a real woman in Anna Joe . . . JOE The bitch that wrote that column is lying and you know it . . . cause let me tell you something , my wife is a proud black woman , and you 're lying too , because you did n't tell my wife about this clipping and you better be glad you did n't ! GRAHAM The problem still remains ! Your sales are dropping and your competitor at Tannen is growing ! JOE You wanta know why . . . Because CAC does not a damn thing about any legitimate publicity for me ! Tannen sponsored three magazine stories and two radio interviews for Jack Adams in the last six months . . . GRAHAM Joe- JOE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was foolish for me to think of it in the first place . . . I 've enough trouble of my own than worrying about whether I will be an advancement for the colored race . GRAHAM You 're vice president material or you 're out ! JOE So that 's it . . . The real reason you came here . . . In other words , I 'm about to be fired ! ! p. 38 GRAHAM On the report I have , I could fire you today , but whether you believe me or not , I want you to have this job , and I 'm going to fight for you to get it , because in my very unimportant life , this is something very important for me to do . . . not just for your sake , but for my own . JOE Now I suppose you 'll tell me that you 're about to be fired ! GRAHAM You know the formula . . . You 're the best man we have , anywhere . . . The way Reynolds thinks , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save anything . . . JOE ( Pause ) I do n't know what to tell you . . . GRAHAM Well , I 'll tell you . . . You 've got to start something right here in your own community . You 've got to be like your wife 's dead husband was . . . You 've got to join organizations , make speeches about civil rights and brotherhood . . . Go to church . . . Now there 's your stepson in there . . . fresh home from school , a minister in the image of his father . He can represent something . . . You can represent something . . . There 's one thing I 've learned in my young life as an American . . . There 's always something laying around to represent . . . So you represent man , and you 're going to become vice president of the Chicago office and old kruschev is going to be awed once more by another American perplexity in the cold war . p. 39 JOE Judging from what Anna told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a big splash around me and the boy regarding this big rally they 're having this week at the church . . . . GRAHAM That 's right Joe , but it ca n't stop right there , it 's got to keep moving . . . I will work with you , and we will put all I 've said into action . . . The two of us together , huh Joe ? JOE Yes . . . GRAHAM Then let me hear it from you man , let me hear something to tell that old sonofabitch tomorrow . JOE ( Pause ) You tell him I 've sold more liquor for him than any man he 's had in the forty years he 's been there . . . GRAHAM And . . . JOE You tell him , I 'm even going to do better . . . . GRAHAM And . . . JOE That 's enough ! GRAHAM What are you getting so excited for Joe . . . Two weeks , give me two weeks , that 's all it will take , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Well , the time has come . . . I told Rosalie I 'd make it back in time for an early dinner . . . JOE I 'll get your coat . . . ( He goes into the house . . . ) Get up off that couch Frank . . . ( He proceeds on to the panel closet by the stairway , gets Graham 's coat and returns to Graham as Frank rises , composes himself for a brief moment , then walks to the doorway , looking on Graham and Joe . . . ) p. 40 JOE ( Noticing Frank at the door . . . ) I want you to meet my stepson , Frank Evans . . . FRANK ( Steps out on the lawn extending his hand for a shake . . . ) Glad to meet you Mr Graham . . . Joe 's always talking about what a great boss you are . . . ( Frank is a tall handsome boy , whose age is about twenty five or six . ) GRAHAM ( Looking to Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . FRANK ( Moving away . . . ) Thanks wo n't do it Mr Graham , just give him a big fat raise , so the family can have two eggs for breakfast instead of one . GRAHAM ( Laughs . . . ) Just like you Joe ! You have him well trained ! FRANK No he does n't mister . Ca n't you tell when somebody 's pulling your backbone ? ( He sits on the steps before the front door . . . . ) GRAHAM ( Pause ) Well , do n't you worry about a thing Joe . . . See you tomorrow and we 'll work it out . . . ( Walking away . . . ) Nice meeting you Frank . . . ( He exits . . . ) FRANK ( Mocking ) Nice meeting you Frank ! The excuses that are parading around in this world as human beings . . . ( Pause ) Well . . . ? ( Joe turns and walks away from him . . . ) p. 41 FRANK What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your business . . . FRANK Where 's everybody ? JOE In church . . . FRANK How depressing can you get . . . I need a drink . . . ( Rises . . . ) JOE For what , I 'd lay odds you 've been guzzling the stuff all night . . . FRANK ( Standing at the door . . . ) It takes one in the morning to heal all the others you had at night , stepfather . . . . JOE And all morning for you . . . It 's a wonder you did n't kill yourself in that car . . . You 'll remember the next time I let you have my keys . Please son , lay off that stuff , huh ? FRANK You 're a weird man Joe . . . A salesman with a sense of morality . JOE Did it ever occur to you , that after being married to your mother all these years , that I might care , that- FRANK Stop it ! ( Pause ) Do n't care . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . . . ( He moves into the house . . . Goes to the cabinet , takes out the bottle and starts pouring himself a drink . . . ) p. 42 JOE ( Enters the house . . . Standing in the living room . . . ) What if I were to tell you , that that man who walked away from here a few minutes ago is prepared morally and influentially to promote me into one of the vice president positions in my firm ? FRANK I 'd say he was putting you on and that 's a good reason for you to join me in having a little taste . . . ( He drinks . . . ) JOE I 'm not jesting boy . . . . FRANK Neither am I. . . The day that man makes you a vice president , a hog will turn his face on a piece of corn and I 'll be doing a buck naked wiggle in Rockefeller Plaza to rock n ' roll music . . . JOE It 's true ! ( Pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything I have to get it , everything . ( He sits . . . ) FRANK ( Pouring himself another drink . . . ) I just hope you do n't give your soul . . . They do n't have enough gold and honor in all America for your soul . . . ( He drinks . . . . ) JOE I do n't have too many choices , when I start counting all the possibilities FRANK ( Stepping out into the living room . . . ) Why do n't you give'em mother . . . p. 43 JOE Do n't play Frank , this is serious . . . . FRANK Alright , what is it ? What kind of spot that man got you in now ? ( Pause ) I know , you 're losing sales . . . JOE I 'm asking you one more time . . . Will you come to work in my office . . . ? FRANK I 'll tell you one more time . . . I have two prime hates in my heart . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . JOE You do n't have so much hate in you when you 're hitting me for money . . . FRANK You can put a stop to that too . . . You know , all of this does n't make sense . . . A few minutes ago you were going to be vice president , but from what I 'm hearing , you 're going to be fired . . . JOE I am not going to be fired . . . but I am going to put a stop to those damn female columnists in those black newspapers- FRANK . . . Calling us polite uncle toms . . . JOE Yes , but what is Jack Adams . . . What is greasy head fish-tail Adams . Prince of Harlem . . . His pink Cadillac versus his yellow Lincoln . I know my boys have n't helped much with their intergrated collegiate arrogance , but our people believe in that junk . . . p. 44 FRANK The comedy of the Negro . . . JOE You used to feel very strongly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once upon a time . . . JOE I have learned boy . . . that in order for a man to despair , he had to in a long range of his life , given so much of himself to what he believed in , what he loved , what- FRANK . . . But I have given ! JOE You have n't been living that long ! FRANK Well maybe that 's the trouble ! I 'm twenty six years old and I can remember myself living a hundred years ago ! ( Pause ) Worry about your advancement organizations , college , grades , graduation , walking picket lines , taking trips to Washington . . . Being very young and wanting so much to grow old and be a first citizen and not a second one . . . but it takes a very short time to know that what 's to come is no more than your grinning sadness . . . your professional dexterity . . . your calmness and soberness. . . your maturity and responsibility . . . You 're polished with spats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You dine in the ball rooms of classic hotels . . . You make sedate speeches on brotherhood and progress . . . Your progress being an occasional uncle tom to dress up in a window to show off to the Communists . . . Progress . . . I call it a hysterical turtle in a rabbit race . p. 45 JOE You say all of that to say what ? FRANK To say that I have learned to reflect on no one but myself . . . I 'll stay out all the nights that pleases me , have all the women who will lie down in bed with me. . . and dry up in some old whiskey glass , and have no one to tell me I 'm reflecting on anyone but myself . . . JOE Maybe Anna is right about you . . . Maybe I do put too much trust in you and not enough in Calder . . . At least he had sense enough to be something , even if it was against his will . . . FRANK Wrong again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he wanted to , or has n't he told you about himself yet . . . JOE Told me what ? FRANK Come on Joe , have a drink with me . . . You 're going to need it . . . JOE ( Moving towards Frank in the dining room . . . ) Told me what Frank . . . ? FRANK ( Pouring a drink . . . ) That he did n't graduate , that he 's not the minister all of you think he is . . . JOE ( Stops at the bottom of the level of the dining room . . . ) You 're lying Frank . . . FRANK I do n't lie Joe ! p. 46 JOE Then say it again ! FRANK He 's not a minister Joe . . . He flunked out . . . JOE No , no , I do n't believe it . . . It , it ca n't be true , it just simply ca n't be true !

Why did n't he tell her last night ? FRANK Do n't ask me . . . JOE ( He drinks . . . ) Anna will kill him ! FRANK Forget it man . . . forget it . . . JOE ( Rises , storms out into the living room . . . ) Are you crazy ! ? Do you know what this means for me ? It means that I am for all certainty out of any chance in getting that job . . . It means for double certainty that I 'm going to be bounced right out on my ears ! FRANK What can I do ! ? JOE Time . . . time . . . I need time . . . ( Calder steps down from the stairs and into the living room . . . ) p. 47 CALDER Hello . . . FRANK Hey . . . What 's that saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps up out of a box . . .

CALDER ( To Joe . . . ) You know what he tried to do last night ? JOE I do n't know what he did and I 'm not interested . . . I 'm concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presume from the tone of your sarcasm , he 's already told you . JOE That 's right . . . CALDER Well , it was just one of those things . . . She knew I was n't interested when I first left here . . . But she just had to have me do it because of some stupid promise she made to my father . . . JOE So now you 're going to break the news to her ? CALDER As soon as she gets in from church . . . JOE Just as simple as that . . . CALDER It wo n't be simple . . . FRANK It will be esthetic ! JOE Shut up Frank . . . Is it necessary that you divulge this information to her today . . . CALDER What 's the pointing in waiting any longer ? JOE Because like you said . . . Things are n't that simple . . . Why she 's already gone and made plans for a homecoming party for you , this Tuesday . . . CALDER What should I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three year divinity course and be back here by party time Tuesday . . . ? JOE I just might have to do something that desperate , because she also made arrangements for you to deliver a speech introducing Reverend Mitchell , this Saturday at a mass civil rights rally to raise money . p. 49 CALDER What ! ? JOE That 's right boy . . . You know your mother . . . That 's only part of the program she 's got planned for you . . . . She along with my boss . . . CALDER Your boss ? JOE That 's right . . . You see , they 're so concerned about me , in other words , keeping me on the job , keeping me from being fired , they 're going through the big trouble of making you the crowning glory of this town . . . But you know . . . and I know that you 're not a minister and you 're not going to be the glory of anything . . . . So , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean my entire family . . .

Just until , say sundown . . . CALDER What 's the difference . . . Now , sundown or any other time . . . JOE . . . Just enough time for me to talk to her , smooth her over . . . soften her up . . . After that , you can tell her anything you want to . . . And if you figure it 's going to be hard facing her this afternoon , you can take off for awhile and by the time you get back , me , Frank and all the rest of us will be here to stand right beside you . p. 50 CALDER ( Pause ) Alright , you may have the time , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ) JOE ( Pause ) He ca n't fool me with that strong man act . . . FRANK What was that sundown business all about ? JOE You 'll see in tim e enough . . . right now I 'm going pay a little visit over at Dr. Harris ' place . . . ( He exits up the stairs . . . ) ANNA ( Enters from the back . . . ) Well , look who 's home for a change . . . What slut did you crawl out of bed from ?

ANNA ( Pause ) One of these days I 'm going to put Frank Evans in the street . . . VIRGE Maybe that would be the best thing , before the two of you kill eachother. . . p. 51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Take everything that drunken whoremonger throws at me . . . VIRGE You 're supposed to be considerate . . . ANNA Considerate ! Why ! VIRGE I have your letter from Reverend Williams ! ANNA Read it . . . VIRGE ( Reads from the letter ) " Dear Mrs Baxter ; In regards to your request , that I speak to some of the members of the board , regarding your son 's possible participation in the Dr Mitchell Saturday program , is highly improper in the procedures of this congregation . However , a regular meeting of the board will be held Wednesday , and I can assure you , your request will be the prime topic on the agenda . I shall speak in favor of your request and whatever decision is made , I will deliver it personally by coming to your home directly after the meeting . I must warn you though , in light of the fact , that Dr Mitchell is one of the world 's most renowned clergymen . . . It has been expressed by many members of this congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be possessed of like or aspiring stature . I shall call you Tuesday to arrange a specific time for our meeting . I thank you for your interest . . . God bless you . I am sincerely yours . . . Reverend Alvin R. Williams . . . ( Pause ) . . . I do n't care what you say , they 're not going to approve it . p. 52 ANNA They will . . . Reverend Williams will see to that or else . . . VIRGE Or else what ? ANNA Seems ol ' Rev has one nasty habit , he just ca n't seem to control . Every woman he knows , he 's got pat her hands , her arms , and feel around a little bit on the sly . . . VIRGE So you figure he 's been doing more than just a little patting with the sisters . . . ANNA From a little talk I had with the maid girl we had here last month , I know for a fact he has . . . VIRGE Sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . have you forgotten . . . ? ( She moves for the dining room ) Calder Sr could 've had an already established congregation , but no , he had to be a pioneer , brave , heroic . . . I will build this temple , for my sons , for my people . . . Well , he did , and then he dropped dead from it ! ( She takes the cover off the dining room table . . . . ) His " people " showed him something . . . The time . . . the time I stood before them . . . that day and merely asked that they approve a commemoration program in his honor . . . VIRGE They turned you down , I know . . . ANNA That was the last time Virge . . . The very last time . . . From here on in , I 'll carry all the tricks . . . I 'm going to take that church away from them , and I 'm going to give it to Calder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come by me to take a piss . . . p. 53 VIRGE How . . . ? How are you going to do this ? ANNA My dear daughter , you 're to have a little talk with three members on that board . . . VIRGE A lot of good that will do . . . They do n't like me anymore than they do you . . . ANNA I 'm not interested in who they like or do n't like , all I know is that Janet Ryan 's girl is in one of your senior classes , so 's Martha 's boy , Alice 's , all board members . . . VIRGE I ca n't believe you 're thinking such thoughts . . . In other words , you want me to threaten those parents with the idea of flunking their kids . . . ANNA I say no such thing . . . VIRGE Then what are you saying ? ANNA I merely suggest that you csll them up one day and say that you 'd like to talk about a few ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd understand . . . VIRGE You 're right they 'd understand . They 'd understand exactly of what I was up to , and I will not let myself become involved in that kind of immoral play . . . ANNA Virge- VIRGE Mother , I am a teacher . . . I could 've been a social worker . . . A lawyer . . . A stenographer , but I gave my whole self to being a teacher . Now that means something . . . How can you stand there and ask me to violate the very conscience of what I 've dedicated my life to . p. 54 ANNA I leave the moralizing to the whites . . . They can afford it , I- VIRGE Do n't talk like that . . . How ! ? ANNA You ask that question because you 've never been black and poor at the same time . . . Well I have , and I will do anything to make sure that I do n't ever have to be that way again , I 'd die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . . . VIRGE You , you say the most rediculous things . . . Going to hell , dying . . . Mother , you keep this up and you 're going to kill somebody , you 're going to kill yourself . . . ANNA That can happen ! ( Points to her mother 's portrait on the wall . . . . . . ) You see that woman . . . I used to stand on the porch of that awful place we lived in down south and watch her walk down the road for miles , everyday , to a place I knew nothing about , except for the fact that she had to wash away the dirt and filth from cloth worn by even filthier and dirtier people , so that I might not have to catch the hell she was catching . . . My mother , old , dusty , tired and unwanted by anyone but me . . . And dying . . . ( Pause ) . . . All I ask is that you make a simple phone call- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politicians are built on lies . . . p. 55 VIRGE I am not a politican , I am a teacher ! ANNA Virge- VIRGE No mother ! No ! ANNA ( Pause ) Alright , if you 're going to be onery about the matter , I 'll call those bitches up myself this very moment ! ( Starts for phone . . . ) VIRGE And I will deny everything you say ! ( Anna turns on her fiercely and slaps her across the face . . . ) ANNA ( Pause ) I 've never quite gotten around to striking people . . . I suppose , it 's just that lately , I find myself wanting so much from everyone here , but no one seems to know what I 'm going through . . . VIRGE But me , since I was but a small girl , it 's always been that way ! ANNA I shared all of that as woman . . . We lived in a house full of men , and I wanted you to be safe , because I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become . . . VIRGE But you keep me so close to you . . . So close I do nt ' know where my own self begins . . . in any kind of world . . . Sometimes other people want me , and I want them , but there is always you . . . I am not a small girl anymore . . . I am a woman , but I live in this house with you , and I 'm growing sick from it ! p. 56 ANNA Virge , Virge . . . I 've got to do this . . . I 've got to be sure . . . I must , it 's expected of me , we 've got to move forward , no matter what . . . ( She grabs Virge by the arms and shakes her violently . . . ) Help me daughter ! Help me ! VIRGE ( Repelling her ) Quiet mother ! Quiet ! ANNA Help me ! Help me ! VIRGE Alright ! I 'll do it ! ( Anna quiets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . . . . . ) VIRGE ( Pause ) It wo n't be a pleasant time for we . . . ANNA Time . . . ?

( She exits up the stairs . . . ) C-U-R-T-A-I-N p. 57 Act 1 , Scene 3 Just about Sundown of the same day . Frank is relaxed in the living room alone watching a television program . Calder enters from the outside and stands in the doorway looking on Frank . . . FRANK ( Turns to notice Calder , then snaps the television off . . . ) You know what fascinates me the most about television ? CALDER ( Stepping into the room . . . ) I would n't know , I never watch it . . . FRANK Oh yes , I forgot , you 're the arty type . . . Well anyway , I make it my business to not let a day pass , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Simply to be awed by the sheer naked genius of it 's consistency to be bad . . . CALDER Where is Joe ? FRANK He went out , he 'll be here . . . . CALDER And the rest ? FRANK They 're upstairs . . . CALDER It 's sundown . . . If Joe is n't back here in ten minutes . . . That 's it . May I have a cigarette ? FRANK Sure . . . ( Gives him a cigarette . . . ) CALDER Thanks . . . p. 58 FRANK ( Lighting the cigarette for Calder ) You know , you 've gotten to be quite a customer to deal with these days . . . CALDER What do you mean ? FRANK Well , it 's almost as if you 've said to yourself ; from here on in , I 'm taking no stuff from no one . . . from here on in , the walk and talk is got to be hard . . . CALDER You talk in riddles , Frank . . . FRANK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange about that , I 'm three and a half years older . FRANK Look , you were home last Christmas . . . You were not the person I 'm talking to now . . . When did you start smoking ? CALDER About two months ago . . . FRANK You drink ? CALDER Sometimes . . . FRANK You smoke a little pot once in awhile ? CALDER What are you trying to do to me ? FRANK ( Pause ) I 'll put some music on . . . ( He moves for the phonograph ) ( As Frank puts the record on , Calder steps out of the door into the yard . . . The music is up now . . . Frank turns , notices Calder 's absence , goes to the door , returns to the record player , clicks a button to bring the music up in the area of the yard . He steps out the door to join Calder . . . . ) p. 59 FRANK I was n't being nosey , it 's just that you 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALDER You will hear it all when mother gets downstairs . . . FRANK Come on Calder , this is Frank . . . You 're not that anxious to go before mother and I know it . . . Come on . . . what did you really do . . . What happened to YOU ? CALDER ( Pause ) Two weeks after I was in the school , I realized how miserable it was going to be . . . I did n't dare quit , so I did what I thought was the next best thing . I went out and bought myself another horn , and in the time I had off from the school , I walked the city , I went in to all kinds of places , met all kinds of people . I started blowing my horn in a small southside club , and in no time , I was known as that wailing kid from New Jersey . . . I MET A GIRL , FELL IN LOVE AND GOT HURT . They hired me after awhile and that 's when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why mother 's frequent visits never bothered me too much , by then , my skill at the masquerade was fine . I MET A GIRL , FELL IN LOVE AGAIN AND GOT HURT AGAIN . Time passed at the school lightly , which I did n't seem to mind too much . . . Time passed at the club , even more lightly , and that disturbed me deeply , because none of the ideas , the visions , the feelings I had in my studies at Crane came to life for me in my playing . . . I FELL IN LOVE AGAIN , GOT HURT AGAIN AND ALMOST FELL TO PIECES . . . I was on the bandstand one night and looked down and there was this evil looking cat walking up the aisle in dirty overalls , with a trumpet under his arm , looking like he had just got off a truck from Mississippi . . . He started blowing as he walked up the aisle , and then he got up on the stand . . . He blew all of us clear off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow the way he did , or that crowd , hushed and quiet the way they were , looking at each- . . . other , eye to eye , with such humanly affection , such humanly revelation . I kept saying to myself , that 's what I want to do , that 's what I have always wanted to do ! He never had a music lesson in his life ! I FELL IN LOVE AGAIN , GOT HURT AGAIN AND ALMOST DIED ! ( The music stops . . . . ) I left the club and gave all my concentration to the school . But by that time , it was too late . . . I knew I was n't going to graduate , I got panicky , I could think of no one but mother . . . but it was about this time I met Tracey , who was just finishing up at conservatory of music down the street from me . I would walk down there each day to meet her and we would talk for hours . ( Joe enters upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What with the terrible ordeal of trying to know when and how I would meet mother , and the agonizing strain of those bad love experiences , Tracey saved me at a time when I was dying . JOE ( Pause ) Why did n't you tell me Frank , that when he unboarded that plane last night , that there was a woman with him ? FRANK ( Pause ) I , I forgot . . . How did you find out ? JOE It seems your buddy here went over to Robert Harris ' this morning to make arrangements for more comfortable quarters than the downtown hotel . . . FRANK I can explain . . . JOE For what . . . ? ( To Calder . . . ) You 've got a woman boy , what 's so unnatural about that ? All I want to know is why you brought her here when you knew full well what your trouble was going to be . . . CALDER She 's not a woman . . . JOE I do n't care if she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CALDER That 's no concern of yours , I gave you the time you asked for and now I 'm going inside to clear it up . . . JOE ( Looks up to the sky ) It is sundown , in fact a little after . . . You know boy , all the while I was over there talking to Dr. Harris , I suddenly realized just how close the time was . I also realized , at that very moment , as I was sitting there , talking to the doctor , that it was very possible , you had dropped that bad news you 've been holding back for ol ' Joe . . . But you know something . . . I was n't worried one bit . p. 61 CALDER I do n't know what you 're talking about . . . ( Starts inside . . . ) JOE Why did you come back here . . . ? ( Pause ) You and this girl want to get married I understand . CALDER ( Pause ) Yes . . . JOE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco opera house , where she 's to take her advance studies . . . CALDER Who told you all of this ? JOE She did . . . Seems I was more effective in having her transferred to the doctor 's place than you . . . Nice girl he 's got Frank . . . Intelligent , mature . . . In fact , I wonder they ever got together . CALDER Stop it ! JOE I 'm sorry son , but if you 're getting married and your bride to be is going to work and go to school at the same time , I immediately wonder as to what you 're going to be doing . . . CALDER I 'm going to organize a jazz group out there with Conte Renzulli . JOE You need money ! CALDER I know . . . JOE ( Pause ) I tell you what I 'll do . . . I will borrow the money and give it to you . . . Providing one thing . . . You carry on this masquerade a couple of weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! No ! ( He starts away . . . ) JOE For a week ! CALDER ( Proceeding in the direction of the door ) I said no ! JOE Come back here and listen to me ! CALDER ( Turning , moving towards him swiftly ) You are crazy man ! You are crazy ! FRANK You wo n't be able to get away with a thing like that ! JOE I 'm going to have to ! FRANK Joe . . . Joe . . . a white man loses a million dollars in the stock market , he loses his mind , he jumps out of a window , he shoots himself in the head , but us Joe , have we , have we become- JOE Yes , we have ! ( Pause ) Oh , you 're so fancy ! ( Pause ) I did n't go to a big college in New England , I barely made it through . . . . . . highschool , but one thing I did , I worked . . . I worked like a dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , the automobiles , the great comfort of knowing I do n't have to live in a dirty colored tenement slum , and I 'm not going to lose that comfort . . . not for you , Anna . . . . ( Moves towards Calder ) . . . or you ! ( Pause ) I 'm not going to argue about it anymore . . . you 'll do it and that 's that . . . p. 63 FRANK I can understand your desperation man , but I do n't see your logic at all . . . I do n't see how you expect to get away with such a thing , even if he goes along with you . . . And another thing , he 's not the only one involved , remember , there 's Tracey , and I 'm sure she- JOE She said , if he approves , she will go along with whatever the program demands . . . And he approves . . . CALDER No I do n't ! JOE Look at you . . . Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was raining , when you knew better . . . but there was always the comfort you found in cuddling up in her arms . . . If you had been a man , you would n't have let her send you off in the first place . . . and in turn , you would n't be standing here before now like a fool . . . CALDER How can I make you understand . . . I know I should have never gone off to that school . . . You talk about how it was before . . . but you 're not looking for it to be any different . . . What if your job was not at stake . . . your big house and everything , would you be so concerned about me then . . . Whatever I did against my wishes in order to please mother , I did out of love . . . I 'm not supposed to use that word around you , Am I Frank ! And I still love her ! And that 's why I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to her for me to become a minister . . . I owe this much to her . . . To sit before her honestly and hope that we remain friends . . . . Things like that are important to me. . . p. 64 JOE I 'm happy to know that boy . . . . ( Goes into his pocket and pulls out a piece of paper . . . . ) . . . because I have here a little medical report I picked up from Dr. Harris . . . I think you should read it . . . . ( Passes it on to the boy ) CALDER ( He reads . . . ) . . . This . . . . this says . . . . JOE It says that any immediate excitement or overly physical exertion could cause her heart to stop forever . . . CALDER I. . . I do n't believe you . . . JOE I did n't ask you . . . It 's the doctor 's report , not mine . . . CALDER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE Would I lie like that about my own wife ! Do n't you think I have my own limits . . . You think that I am so low- CALDER I do n't believe this ! JOE ( Pause ) Alright boy . . . we shall see . . . ( He looks up towards the window . . . . ) Anna ! Anna ! ( There is no response . . . ) Anna ! ( Still no response , he heads for the door . . . . ) p. 65 FRANK ( Following him ) Joe , Joe , what are you doing . . . . ? JOE ( At the door . . . ) Anna . . . . ! ( After hearing her response ) . . . Come downstairs for moment . . . I want to talk to you ! ( He steps down into the yard ) FRANK What was that for . . . . ? JOE I will tell her ! FRANK You have no right to do that . . . JOE I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! CALDER Do n't worry about it Frank . . . he ca n't frighten me , I 'm ready . . . JOE You better be . . . Because she 's gon na scream , she 's gon na kick , bite and scratch until somebody strong grabs a hold of her and tie her down to the floor like a wild animal , to keep the low down meanness in her from tearing you apart . . . FRANK Joe . . . JOE That if she lives through it . . . FRANK No Joe , no . . . . JOE Here she comes Calder . . . p. 66 CALDER ( Upon seeing her through the window . He moves away with his back to the house , stops suddenly . . . ) Do n't tell her ! Do n't tell her ! ANNA ( Stepping out of the door . . . ) What is it Joe . . . ? JOE I 've been trying to convince the boys here of the idea of all of us , taking a drive down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about that . . . . ? ANNA Is that what you called me downstairs for ? And I 'm sure you have more important things to do , Joe Baxter . . . Calder . . . CALDER ( Turns ) Yes , Mother . . . ANNA Come here . . . . ( Calder turns , goes to Anna and stands just beneath her at the door level . . . . ) ANNA ( Touches the side of his face with the palm of her hand . . . . ) Your flesh is so warm . . . Come inside , I 'll fix you some tea . . . ( Calder follows Anna into the house . . . ) FRANK ( Pause ) I do n't know how you 're going to pull this off Joe , but I 'm certainly goin ' to make it my business to be here every minute to watch it . p. 67 JOE I have a plan . . . It will work , if all the emotions involved hold up . . . FRANK And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE I was lying . . . I hated to do that to the boy . . . FRANK You seemed pretty sure of yourself . . . JOE I had nothing to go on except the fact , that I did n't believe he really wanted to tell her . . . She 's done something to that boy . FRANK And what is that ? JOE To use a vulgar expression . . . She 's got him by the balls . . . ( He starts for the inside . . . ) FRANK Joe . . . JOE ( Turning at the door ) Yes son . . . FRANK This is n't going to be simple . . . If you get caught you 're going to be in worse shape , than if you had left everything be . . . So let me say , you 're going to have to walk very gently from here on in . . . You 're going to have to talk lightly and very sweetly . . . And even as you sleep , you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there is to come a time when you 're going to feel awfully alone , like you 're going to be sitting in the middle of avast desert , without food or water . . . You might have to bury your face in the ground and drink sand . . . p. 68 JOE ( Pause ) I saw that happen to a man , once . C-U-R-T-A-I-N@@ About three AM , the night of the party . . . The light comes up on the lawn . The background representing the living room is dark except for the three windows across the front of the house . . . The party has ended . ( Dr. Harris steps out on the lawn , followed by Joe . . . The doctor is a distinguished looking man , tall , with sprinkled grey strains in his hair . He is wearing horn rimmed glasses and looks more to be a college professor than doctor . . . ) DR . HARRIS I would say the party was quite a success , would n't you Joe ? JOE Doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . HARRIS Yes , there were some mighty important people in your house tonight man . . . Not my cup of tea though . JOE Anna would be very displeased hearing that come from you Robert . DR . HARRIS No doubt she would . . . but are they really considering you for that job , or are they trying to take you ? JOE Doctor , it 's like my wife says . . . you 'll never know until you 've put everything into it . DR . HARRIS That fellow Graham in there . . . there 's something about him that annoys me . . . He reminds me of a fellow I knew once , who was a big liar . . . p. 70 JOE I 've always said , it does no good to call a man a liar until you make him one . . . DR . HARRIS I hope you 're right . . . JOE Robert , do you think I 'd be putting myself out on the block this way , if I were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you yesterday . . . I do n't really have too much of a choice . . . DR . HARRIS You do n't . . . That much I 'm certain of . . . JOE Tell me. . . how 's Calder 's girl getting on over at your place ? DR . HARRIS I do n't think that there is a place in this town , that that young lady could n't get along in . . . Fine girl . . . very fine girl . . . JOE You ca n't begin to know how much I appreciate all this Robert . . . This makes it much easier for the boy . . . This way , he does n't have to sneak about and she does n't have to stay in an impersonal place like a hotel . . . You know what , when you and Paula walked into the house with her tonight , introduced her to Anna and Anna in turn introduced her to Calder , I almost had a stroke . ( Laughs ) DR . HARRIS Having strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOE ( Stops laughing ) I guess not . . . So what did you tell Anna about the girl ? p. 71 DR . HARRIS I told her she was the daughter of a friend of Paula 's from San Francisco , since that 's where they plan to go from here . JOE That was good thinking doctor . . . DR . HARRIS Now what about that letter you had for me . . . I spoke to Dr Lawrence tonight and he said he would help us . . . JOE Good . . . I have the letter right here in my pocket . . . DR . HARRIS Well , you better let me have it . . . ( Joe reaches into his pocket , comes out with the letter and passes it on to the doctor . . . . ) DR . HARRIS I 'll call him the first thing tomorrow , dictate it , he will type it , sign it and put it into the mails immediately . . . Tomorrow being Wednesday and coming by air from California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOE You give the doctor my deepest thanks . . . DR . HARRIS I would suggest Joe , that as soon as that letter gets here , you make it your urgent business to see to that boy getting away from here . . . JOE Why that 's the whole point of the letter Robert . . . DR . HARRIS It 's a good letter . . . JOE Frank composed it . . . picked out the name of the congregation and everything . . . p. 72 DR . HARRIS Anna wo n't like it . . . I know she wo n't . . . I do n't care if he got an invitation from the Church Of England . . . And the most important fact still remains . . . She has got to know the truth sooner or later . . . JOE Robert , after I 'm made vice president of CAC , everything is going to work out just fine . . . DR . HARRIS You 've got an imagination Joe Baxter . . . and what an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . HARRIS The fact that you planned all of this with such reckless connivance to have Calder parade around here as a fake minister , waiting on this fictitous letter of an invitation , from a fictitous congregation , is maddening when I think about the many possibilities of you being caught at it . JOE We 're not going to get caught . . . DR . HARRIS In case you do , neither myself or Dr Lawrence knows anything about it . . . JOE Of course not . . . DR . HARRIS As long as we understand one another , I will help in any way I can . . . JOE It 's as if you were an abortionist doctor , I could n't know a thing . . . DR . HARRIS I better get back to Paula now . . . ( The doctor and Joe are headed for the door . . . Joe is following . . . ) p. 73 JOE Robert . . . . ? DR . HARRIS Yes Joe . . . ? JOE You are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARRIS ( A slight chuckle . . . ) If I were . . . I could trust telling it to you . . . . ( The two men enter the house as a very charming looking young girl dash out on to the lawn from the back of the house . . . She is being chased by Calder . . . She stops . . . he stops . She moves around one of the tables . . . He moves after her . . . . ) CALDER ( Moving around the table . . . ) It 's useless , useless , give up little girl , give up . . . I 've got you trapped , give ! ( He leaps across the table for her . . . . ) ( She moves back as he tries to grab her arm . . . He loses his balance and falls atop the table . . . . ) CALDER ( Sitting up on the table , holding his arm . . . . ) Ohhhhhhhhhh ! TRACEY ( Moving towards him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you hurt yourself , I 'm sorry . . . ( As soon as she gets within arm 's reach he grabs her . . . . ) CALDER Got you ! p. 74 TRACEY Oh you sneak ! CALDER You 're lassoed for life ! TRACEY For real ! CALDER For real real . . . TRACEY Then I surrender peacefully . . . ( She moves away from him . . . ) I 'm not a girl who believes in fighting reality . . . CALDER You know something ? TRACEY What do you know something . . . CALDER Do n't know why , but I feel good tonight . . . . . TRACEY Me too . . . Hey , what am I talking about . . . I do n't feel good about anything . . . I have no reason to . . . CALDER Feeling good does n't have anything to do with reason . . . TRACEY Now you know I do n't buy that kind of talk . . . There 's a reason for everything . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . it 's this way . . . You see . . . well . . . CALDER You see what I told you . . . TRACEY Alright . . . I 'll feel good . . . p. 75 CALDER Fine . . . TRACEY ( Stomps her foot on the ground ) But I do n't feel good , I feel bad ! CALDER But you just- TRACEY For a reason ! CALDER What reason . . . ? TRACEY I 'm scared . . . CALDER Scared of what ? TRACEY Your mother . . . CALDER Oh that 's nothing , everybody 's afraid of mother , why- TRACEY Now do n't get me wrong . . . I think your mother is a fabulous and charming woman , but she frightens the hell out of me ! CALDER How ? TRACEY I think she knows . . . CALDER Do n't be ridiculous . . . she does n't know a thing . . . If she did , being afraid would be the least of your worries . . . TRACEY But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept searching my eyes . . . asking me questions , and smiling as if she knew , like she was saying to herself , over and over again ; " I know your game you little wench , I 'm on to you " Oh , I do n't know what to do Calder ! I 'm so afraid ! We 've got to get out of here ! p. 76 CALDER ( Grabs her by the arms . . . ) Stop it ! TRACEY ( She snaps out of it and laughs . . . ) Do n't you think I would make a good little actress . . . . ? CALDER ( Pushing her away . . . ) Why you ! Here I am shaking in my pants , why I should throw you my knee and give you a good spanking . . . TRACEY Violence my boy is the final resort of all weak men . . . If you do n't believe me. . . check your history books . . . CALDER Did you call your mother today ? TRACEY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? TRACEY I told her the same thing as I did yesterday , and the day before . . . a lie . . . The only difference , being my deftness at variation . . . CALDER You did n't tell her about us yet ? TRACEY Right , and I 'm not going to say a word until we get to California , and I get the money she promised me . . . . CALDER I told you Joe is giving us money . . . . TRACEY That 's your money and until I 'm sure that everything is going to be fine , I 'm not taking any chances . . . p. 77 CALDER But . TRACEY ( Puts her hand over his mouth . . . ) Hush ! ( She takes her hand away . . . ) Calder , I get along with my mother and father very well . . . Being an only child , I learned at a very early age , that I had to set the conditions , if I were to ever be happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself get into this mess ? TRACEY Stop kicking yourself about it . . . You 've committed yourself and that 's that . . . CALDER If I only knew for certain that Joe and Dr. Harris was lying about mother 's health , I'd- TRACEY You 'd what ? CALDER I 'd do something ! You did n't help any , letting Joe sweet talk and- TRACEY I told you Calder . . . Joe lied about me . . . I did n't tell him I was for you going through with this fraud . . . He must be an awfully frightened man . . . But then again , that is n't what really made you do this , is it ? CALDER I do n't know what it was . . . I. . . I. . . TRACEY Tell me Calder . . . Tell me what it was that brought us here in the first place . . . p. 78 CALDER . . . Yesterday as Joe kept batting me around about mother being ill , I kept thinking about the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I was standing before his bed and he reached out , held me by the arms and drew me close to him . . . I can remember the odor he had on him . . . It was that smell you get in the rooms of hospitals where people are sick and dying . . . He kept muttering to mother about what a lonely face I had and I kept asking myself ; what in hell is a lonely face . . . He said , I want him to stand in a pulpit one day and wear God 's cloth . . . promise me Anna , promise me . . . TRACEY And she promised him ? CALDER She did . . . Finally he let me go and I slowly walked away from the room until I was out of his sight , then I ran . . . I could n't think of nothing but to get away from that dying man . . . I felt so damn bad about it . . . Not about him dying , but about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buried my face in the grass until Dr. Harris came and took me inside , told me not be afraid , that he was dead . You know what I did . . . ? I ran to his body and I screamed and I struck him with my fists and I kept hitting him and hitting him . . . Mother held me and pulled me into the kitchen , but all I could say , was please do n't let me be a preacher , please do n't let me die and please , do n't ever let me be a preacher . . . She sat down and held me and wiped my tears away and said ; if God never calls you , I 'd never force you on him for a soul in this world . . . I was very happy , ten minutes after my father died , because I never liked churches and preachers . . they always reminded me of slaves and funerals . p. 79 TRACEY But she lied . . . CALDER Yes , she lied . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right after I graduated from Crane . . . She said , I know I promised you , but I should 've known better . . . I should 've known that you ca n't make promisesto children because you can never tell what they 're going to be or become in the long time they have ahead of them to live . . . . . . She said ; you go . . . you go and be the best of all clergymen and when it 's done . . . you may do whatever your heart tells you . . . I thought she was being very fair . . . I used to call her my angel God , because when I was a small boy , she kept me so warm , loved me so warm .

( Turning , looking at him ) That 's one thing my old man did n't allow in his house , when I was a boy . . . FRANK What 's that ? JOE Reading at the eating table . . . Used to say : Who do you think you are ? Rockefeller 's son or something . . . Dumb bastard . . . he could n't even write his name . . . FRANK Depends upon what you 're reading . . . Listen to this . . . ( Reads from paper . . . ) " Though Carne-Ashley-Carne are trying to keep it under the hat , it is common knowledge all over our town that they are brewing Joseph Baxter of Northfield , N.J. for a vice president 's position in one of their mid-western offices . With this news , where are the die-hards among us who say the race is n't advancing . Of course , this will come as sad news to Jack Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing Tannen Distributors , Inc. " p. 117 JOE I bet when old slick-head Jack reads that , he 'll burn like a stove . FRANK Now listen to this . . . Some chick writing a so-called society column : " It was quite evident from talking to young Calder Evans last Tuesday night at his home-coming affair in his mother 's plush New Jersey sub-urban home , that he is a young man with a glorious destiny in his calling as a clergyman .

Boy , niggers should cut out this bullshit . . . Give one of'em a civil service job . . . let him graduate from college or some medical school , and all of a sudden , he 's a member of the social register . JOE Do n't take it lightly , boy . Those things pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what hurts me . . . Say , I saw that letter from California in the mailbox today . . . ( Stepping out into the living room ) JOE And it 's still in there . I do n't know why she has n't taken it out yet . Did you tell Calder ? FRANK Yes . . . JOE Good ! I want her to make that little discovery herself .

CALDER Letter ? What letter ? JOE ( Looks at Frank ) Your California letter . . . CALDER Oh , that . . . I was thinking Joe . . . JOE You 've been thinking . . . CALDER Yes , and I- JOE Now listen to me , Calder . From what I 've been hearing and from what I 've seen , I would say , that you 're getting a little too used to all of this . . . All I asked of you , was that you stay about this house , this town , for two weeks . . . as a minister . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . That letter your mother is bringing in will resolve what takes place after that point . You forgot about the letter . . . Do n't let yourself get too used to this place , boy . . . because you ca n't stay here , and you better know it . ( Anna enters the house ) p. 121 ANNA Hello dear . . .

Well , I guess we better all get a move on us , the program will be getting under way at four . . . ( She starts for the stairs . . . ) JOE Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Joe . . . ? JOE Uh , was there any mail ? ANNA Oh , I 'm sorry . . . ( Thumbing through the mail ) Here you are dear . . . ( Handing him three letters ) JOE Thank you . . .

TRACEY I do n't understand . . . JOE She opened it ; she read it ; and now she 's going to keep it . . . I 'm a fool for not thinking of that possibility . . .

A long distance phone call , right at a time while she 's in this room . . . Is that alright with you , Mr minister ? CALDER Yes , I guess so . JOE You guess so ! Boy , everything you do from here on in has got to be for certain ! When this business is over , you 've got to get out of here ! ( He goes to the dining room and takes the paper off the table , returns and hands it to Calder . . . ) You read this . Your name . . . big as daylight ; and there are going to be a lot more like it . And should it keeps up for too long a time , somebody 's going to read it who knows better .

They do n't bother to understand people . . . only things . . . TRACEY What things ? CALDER You remember how I was certain that I had to come home for this last time . You remember . . . ? Well , Joe put me before her the other night and he dared me. . . he said go ahead . . . He stood me before her and I was trembling and there was ice in my blood because I was more concerned about her and me as persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , if she had known at that moment . . . not about him becoming some damn vice president . p. 124 TRACEY What is it you want to do Calder ? CALDER I do n't know . . . TRACEY You 've been on the edge of something for the past two days . . . What is it Calder ? CALDER I want to make Joe understand , that it would be better for all of us . . . If she knew what we are going to do today . TRACEY No Calder . . . CALDER Look Tracey . . . I 've spent more time with mother this week than I 've spent in a lifetime . . . We have been two people really trying to know one another . . . I want her to know me . . . I want her to see me for the first time . . . To know what the hell I 'm all about . . . I 'm so unhappy Tracey ! I do n't want to leave like this ! . TRACEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inside of us , that makes us so unhappy , is really not inside of us at all , but- CALDER It is inside of me , and it 's killing me ! TRACEY It 's not going to be that simple ! ( Pause ) Calder , Calder , my father would hate you if he knew how involved I am with you and this whole business , but I go my way and do what I have to do , so that you may love me and I may love you , and I will tell him the most final lie , so that he does n't dehumanize himself with useless hate for anyone ! p. 125 CALDER She will understand this time , I know she will . . . TRACEY Calder , if my observations about your mother are correct she 's going to cut you to pieces ! CALDER She wo n't ! She wo n't ! TRACEY Alright ! What am I supposed to do in case she does !

DR . HARRIS Break that door down man , break it down . . . JOE No . . . She 'll come out . . . She 'll come out sooner than you think . . . Why she 'll be stomping her feet and pushing everybody around in no time . . . DR . HARRIS There wo n't be anyone here left to push around , but you Joe . . . Virge and Calder are leaving today . . . And Flora . . . she 's been sitting on the floor outside Anna 's room all day , just- JOE What- ( He charges up the stairs . . . . ) ( The doctor follows Joe as Virge descends from the stairs carrying her traveling bags . ) VIRGE ( Lowering the bags to the floor . ) I do n't know why Joe permits all of this . . . ( Pause ) You ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ( He rises and goes to pick up his own bags in a far corner of the room . . . ) VIRGE Well , Frank . . . FRANK Well what . . . ? VIRGE We 're leaving . . . FRANK Good-bye . . . VIRGE ( Pause ) Good-bye . . . We better leave Calder . . . FRANK Where 're you going ? VIRGE Does it matter ? FRANK Everything matters . . . What will you do . . . . ? Get married . . . follow all the good democratic American rules . . . Have children . . . sign'em up in the boy scouts . . . Hey . . . that gives me an idea . . . maybe I should go with you . . . get married . . . have as many children as possible , then sign'em up in the boy scouts and being my children , they might instill a sense of decency in their activities . . . ( Laughs until the laughter trickles off into a cough ) And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Here . . . The two of you . . . have a farewell drink with ol ' Frank . VIRGE No thank you ! You 've set yourself up as some moral god in this house who thinks he has all the answers . . . p. 137 FRANK No I do n't ! ( Pause ) I used to go with a girl from San Francisco . The only female I ever loved , after getting out of bed with . I was with that girl for six months , when six days was a record for me . . . And let me tell you something . . . she really had me going . . . I threw my armor away , the sun glasses from my eyes , my shirt , my trousers , my drawers , everything . . . There were endless hours of talk about Kant , Hegel . . . . . . DuBois , King . . . I even read quiet poetry to her at six o'clock in the morning . . . And before I knew it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , buck naked in the middle of the street , cold . . . . . . and with sun in my eyes . . . Just at this time when she started muttering about what she thought was love . . . was merely intellectual affection . . . What kind of language is that ! So , I stood by her door ; I crawled under her window and cried . . . help , but she would scream out , " I do n't love you . What do you want from me ? " , and I would answer , " Do n't love me , but help me , help me to walk back to that place from where I came . " CALDER ( Pause ) And then what happened ? FRANK I crawled away , bleeding like a pig . . . ( He takes a drink ) CALDER ( Pause ) And how did you feel after that ? p. 138 FRANK I wanted to kill her ! ( Pause ) Love or no love atall . . . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . . . VIRGE ( Muttering , under her breath ) You do n't leave yourself , either . . . FRANK What did you say ? VIRGE Get up . . . . ! ( Pause ) Come Calder . . . ( Calder and Virge exit . . . . ) ( Frank sits alone as we hear a commotion off stage between Dr Harris and Joe . . . ) DR . HARRIS ( Stepping down from the stairs ) I do n't care what you say , you 're wrong , man , wrong ! JOE ( Following him ) We will wait and see Robert , and that 's that . . . DR . HARRIS But Joe- JOE ( Sits ) Shut up Robert ! DR . HARRIS Did you know that the church is blaming Anna for the whole business , that they are getting in touch with the school to see whatever legal action they can take against her and Calder . . . Now I beg of you Joe , think of your child , if nothing else ! JOE Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Please leave me alone . . . p. 139 DR . HARRIS ( Pause ) Okay Joe . . . I 'll call you later . . . ( Going out of the door ) Good-day . . . JOE ( Pause ) What did he expect ? Of course they 're going to rip her up . They 're going to tear us down boy . . . They 're going to tear us down to nothing . ( The phone rings . . . Joe picks up ) JOE Hello . . . Richards . . . Alright , I guess . . . I see . . . Yes , look man , I. . . I , get off this phone ! ( Hangs up ) . . . Some damn jerk that works in my office , calling to tell me that I 've been fired . . . They can go to hell , as long as I have my health and strength , I can get another job ! FRANK I 'll tell you what . . . JOE You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make believe that sand is water . . . and you drink it . JOE ( Joe rises abruptly and goes into the dining room where Frank is sitting and takes the bottle away from him . . . ) Get out of my house ! Get out ! FRANK ( He rises and stumbles out into the living room . . . ) Property . . . Property . . . Property ! p. 140 JOE I worked hard for you boy . . . I loved you . . . But . . . but you do n't care about nothing . . . nothing ! You 've never done nothing ! It 's always words ! words ! words ! but nothing ! FRANK ( Leaning up against the door with his face towards the street ) But I do care . . . I care . . . I care . . . and it hurts . . . it hurts . . . . . . it hurts . . . ( Flora rushes in . . . ) FLORA Daddy ! Daddy ! Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He restrains her with an embrace ) JOE Now Baby . . . She 's coming out . . . FLORA What 's wrong with her ? JOE Your mother wanted something . . . She wanted it very badly , because when she was a girl like you , somebody told her she was n't good enough to have it . . . Of course , you know your Mother . . . Nobody tells her she is n't good enough , on anyone 's terms . She just could n't be content with knowing that she was one of the most fabulous women in this world . . . she had to prove it . . . And when everyone thought I was going to be a big vice president , in a big company , she figured the job was almost done . . . FLORA I heard her Daddy . . . I heard her in her room and she was talking , crying-talking. . . like . . . like . . . I want her Daddy ! I want her ! I want her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Pause ) She 's going to be with you . . . She 's going to be with you this very moment . . . ( He forcfully exits up the stairs ) ( You can hear Joe 's voice call for Anna to open the door . . . Then there is the noise of his body and feet banging and pushing at the door . . . Finally we hear the sound of the door cracking open . . . Joe comes down the stairs carrying Anna bodily in his arms . . . When he reaches the center of the floor , he puts her down , feet first . She is in very flimsy sleeping attire . She stands tensely , looking directly at Joe . ) JOE Now I have had enough . . . Flora here has n't had a decent meal in three days . She 's been alone , bewildered and motherless , much longer than three days , Anna . I 'm going into the kitchen and cook us a dinner , and we 're going to sit at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another like human beings should , and mearwhile , you 're going to sit here and talk to your daughter and you 're going to do everything short of death to make her know that we have n't lost our minds ; that you are her mother , and that 's what you 're going to always be , no matter . . . Now you 've heard me . . . I mean it . . . get to it . ( He exits forcfully into the kitchen ) ( Anna turns abruptly and starts for the stairs . . . . ) FRANK ( Still leaning on the door with his face towards the street . . . . ) If you had know then . . . That your life would turn out the way it is today . . . taking in all the results with yourself . . . Calder , me , Virge , Joe and Flora . . . . What would you have done ? p. 142 ANNA Do n't ask me the fool 's question . . . Joe can go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated to polishing your nails twice a day ? Was the light makeup on your face necessary ? Would you have been such a model girl , such a model student ? . . . . . . Where did you get the idea to join a sorority ? Would you have gone through all that trouble to integrate us into this neighborhood ? ANNA ( Steps towards him ) We had that right ! FRANK ( Now he turns his face towards her from the wall . . . . ) That Christian right for which we bend the spinal cords of our dignity on ; the equality we work for , we plan for , we pray for , we fight communism for , we even do a jig for ! ANNA I never bent my back for anyone ! ( She goes to the window ) This was my lace . . . my light by the window . . . ( She goes out the door onto the lawn ) My green grass . . . my shade on this lawn . . . For your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . A cool fresh place to lie upon , so that little awful man out there could n't get to your pride . . . . I built you a sanctuary here son and you were too much the damn fool to live with it , and Joe never understood how I did it . p. 143 FRANK ( He steps down onto the yard ) The doorstep at the temple of democracy . . . After centuries of running so hard and so long . . . cutting across fields . . . through crowded city streets . . . down back country roads . . . They say we 're getting closer everyday . . . I guess it 's because we 've had a great deal of experience at running . . . ( He projects his arm out towards the street . . . . ) I can see them . . . Ca n't you ? Take a look Mother ; there they are . ( Pause ) . . . See them with their hands stretched out , chasing a neat little bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angelic faces ; sitting up there all comfortable , secure , throwing confetti into the air , and those white horses , moving faster and faster . . . But take a look at us . . . See how fast we can run . . . Take another look at those smiling angelic faces . . . No wonder we run so fast , huh ? Look , one of us got a hold on it , now two of us , now-Let go you fool ! Let go ! ( Pause ) Now I know that that carriage is a striking thing to look upon , but ca n't they hear those rusty old wheels , scraping and clucking away . . . . . . an entire history . . . with little knowledge . . . little love and little peace ? Or ca n't they see . . . that just twelve feet ahead , before their very eyes . . . IS THE MOUNTAIN SIDE ! ( He moves away from her ) p. 144 ANNA Tell me , if you were to come upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for one moment , one second , you had to hold on to your pride on a hot dirty road somewhere in Georgia . What would you do ? ( Pause ) You ca n't answer ? Because you do n't know . . . Or what would you do , if he placed you down deep in some dark old sewer for a hundred years ? ( Pause ) There would not be a moment when you were not scratching your flesh away to come up out of that hole , even if you knew for certain , the world was burning in flames . Now would n't you ? ( Pause ) Answer me ! ( Pause ) No , no , you ca n't answer . . . People like you want to stop rain from the sky ! Being too damn ignorant to know that rain stops for not a living soul on this earth . . . Go out and buy yourself a raincoat and umbrella , son . . . ( She turns to enter the house when she sees Joe standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner Joe . . . I 'm returning to my room . JOE You what- ANNA ( Moving past him and on into the house . . . ) I said I 'm returning to my room . . . I 'm going to lock it up , even if I have to nail the door down . . . And I will not come out until I 'm good and ready and not before . ( She is in the room now ) p. 145 JOE ( Behind her ) You did n't hear me good , Anna . . . ANNA All the years of my marriage with you , Joe , I 've heard you . But I have yet to see you do anything but to work out alright in the places I set down for you . JOE You talk to my child ! ANNA ( Motions to Flora ) I am tired ! Please understand that , Flora . Your mother is tired . . . She loves you , believe me , but I 've got to get away , I 've just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ( Frank is now at the door looking on from the outside . . . ) ANNA No Joe , No . . . JOE ( Getting closer to her ) Please , Anna . . . ANNA No ! JOE ( He slaps her with all the force he can muster . . . ) Woman ! ( The forces from the blow sends Anna sprawling on the couch . . . She rises , props herself and stands before him . . . . ) ANNA ( Pause ) I am returning to my room . . . ( She turns her back on him and walks away . . . ) p. 146 JOE Hold it , Anna . . . ( Pause ) I own all the rooms in this house . . . If you ca n't straighten up and be my wife , maybe that 's alright , but I 'll be damn if I 'm going to let you mistreat my child . . . You 're going to have to lock yourself up in a room somewhere else . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . This very day . . . this very minute . . . You have bought your limit with me woman . . . ANNA ( Turns to him . . . Her eyes and face have never been seen in this fashion ) I see . . . ( Frank backs away from the door . . . Anna turns and starts for the stairway , when suddenly she turns and dashes out of the house . . . Joe rushes after her . . . ) JOE ( At the door ) Anna ! ( Just as she hits the walk , Frank blocks her physically . . . She struggles with him ferociously . . . ) ANNA Turn me loose ! Turn me loose ! ( She breaks away from Frank and heads for the street . . . . ) JOE Step out of this yard woman , and I 'll kill you ! ANNA ( She stops and turns to him ) You ever dare put your hand on me again , man . . . if you ever dare touch me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see what you 've done to him . . . You see the blood in his eyes ! ANNA You talk as if all those who lived in this house were the victims ; preys of an old bitch who did n't have anything better to do with her time . . . You know better than that . . . You know how much I 've given this man . . . You , yourself once told me that Calder was eating me alive . . . FRANK Yes , but when you first looked upon him , on the very day he was born . . . Was he then bewitched by those little inner parasites ? Was I nothing ? ! ANNA Why do n't you leave me alone . . . I told you what to do . . . write your book and let it pass , let it pass . . . ( Turns on Joe ) You . . . you bastard . . . You have the nerve to put me out of this house ! ( Turns and starts out ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot out of this gate , just one- ( Anna is heading for the gate , with Joe pursuing her . . . ) FRANK Mother , Mother . . . You remember that little man you were telling me about . . . Mother , listen to me , I 'm talking to you . . . You , you , you fucking black bitch ! ( Anna and Joe stop simultaneously and seize upon Frank . . . He turns to elude their pursuit . . . He stops . . . they stop . . . . ) p. 148 ANNA ( Pause ) I 'll always remember ! FRANK ( Turns sharply ) . . . Is he a murderer ? Is he a politician ? Is he lawyer ; clergyman ? Is he an industrialist , racketeer ? Maybe he 's a general in the army or maybe he teaches philosophy and liberal psychology at the university of the world . . . Undoubtedly he 's possessed of all these men , and undoubtedly he 's mad . . . because he was the man driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And those people . . . those smiling faces , sitting up there all safe and lovely . . . Well , let me tell you ; they did n't know that their driver was about to commit universal suicide . . . You see , they were too busy watching all of us run like a fool . . . And of course , we did n't know . . . How could we ? We must be born . . . We must be nurtured . . . We must be free in our own spirits , as all humans must . . . So , in order that we may have green grass on the lawn , laces by the window and long taxi journeys . . . IN ORDER THAT WE MAY LIVE . . . We have no other life before us to live but the one we 're chasing down in that little golden vehicle . . . As for myself . . . I do n't want to be the first Negro to sit on top of the moon . . . to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen button . ( Pause ) . . . What do you think would happen , if we were to drop out of sight , or took cover behind a tree ? You think the passengers on that carriage , no longer having us in sight for their entertainment , might turn their heads and see for the first time in their lives the kind of man they hired to drive them across the world . Or you think , that since it 's the feeling that we are on our way . . . we 're so close to them . . . that we can touch'em. . . that someone might bring it upon himself , to get a hold of that little fellow , by his hands , his feet , his entire body and I mean hold him ! ( Pause ) You think that might happen ? No . . . We 're not going to hide behind a tree . . . We 're not going to drop out of sight and we 're not going to grab a hold of anybody , because already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out stretched hands , he has rocked the pillars of sanity in our souls . . . Yours Joe . . . Yours Mother . . . Mine . . . and even you , little Flora . . . in our obsession for his Cadillacs ! His time clocks ! His religions ! His wars ! His women ! HIS VERY IMAGE ! ( Pause ) It was on my graduation day . . . I was sixteen years old . . . ( Pause ) That was the last time I felt your arms about my shoulder . . . ( Frank 's Mother motions towards him but he holds his hand up to stop her . . . She stops . . . . . ) ( After a long moment of silence . . . Anna turns and slowly enters the house . . .

JOE That 's right , Anna , I can . . . ANNA Tomorrow . . . If it 's alright with you . . . I 'd like it if you 'd take me and Flora to New York for the day . . . JOE Sure Anna . . . ANNA You 'll be able to get the day , wo n't you ? JOE I was n't going to work anyway . . . ANNA And why not ? JOE I got fired !
