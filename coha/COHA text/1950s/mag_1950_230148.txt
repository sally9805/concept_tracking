One day last week , Polish Counselor Aleksander W. Rudzinski wearily rose from his seat on U.N . ' s Committee on Statelessness . He pattered obediently after his Soviet puppetmasters who were putting on yet another walkout to protest the presence of a Nationalist Chinese delegate . <P> Soviet walkouts were an old story to Rudzinski . But this time he kept on going . He walked out the door of U.N. , out the door of the Polish consulate in New York where he was also legal counselor , and out the door of Polish citizenship . Stateless Person Rudzinski appealed to the U.S. for aid and asylum , in the cause of preserving Poland 's " independence and initiative . . . in relation to the Soviet delegation . " - <P> Similarly , and almost simultaneously , the time for decision was at hand for two members of Czechoslovakia 's consulate in <P> New York . Since the February 1948 coup in Prague , Acting Deputy Consul Vladislav Matejcek and his colleague , Arnost Fried , had been mulling over when to break with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed his resignations to the Polish U.N . delegation , Matejcek and Fried mailed theirs . <P> The Czechs , too , asked the U.S. for asylum . Tall , good-looking Matejcek , 40 , brushed off reporters ' questions about a " sailing order " said to have been handed to Fried . " Those recall orders , " he laughed , " are ludicrous . They do n't exist . You get a phone call , are escorted to a plane or ship , never even given your tickets , and that 's the last that 's ever heard of you . "
