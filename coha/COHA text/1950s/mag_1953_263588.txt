IF the U.S. could find a permanent peacetime method to spur industry to build new plants and modernize old ones-thus achieving the higher productivity which brings down prices and raises real wages-the consumer would benefit enormously . The U.S. has achieved such expansion in wartime through the use of " accelerated amortization , " otherwise known as the " quick tax write-off . " This permits the writing off of defense-essential plants and equipment in five years instead of the 20 normally required by the Internal Revenue Bureau . In World War I , this practice spurred the building of $650 million in new facilities ; in World War II , , another . $6 billion worth was constructed , " and since Korea , the whopping total of $27.8 billion for new defense facilities , with quick write-offs covering 61% ( $16.8 billion ) of the total cost . Petroleum refining is expanding by 10% , steel by 23% , iron ore by 50% , electric power by 56% , aluminum by 143% , magnesium by 512% , and titanium by 4300% . <P> Now that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put an end to fast write-offs in most industries . But since fast write-offs worked such industrial miracles in emergencies , why should the practice not be made permanent ? One objection is that most of the expansion is paid for by money that otherwise would have been paid in taxes . For this reason , and the fact that the quick write-off has been misused by some corporations , Congress ' Hardy Subcommittee has denounced the policy as " the biggest bonanza that ever came down the Government pike . " To many companies the policy was a bonanza . But there is no doubt that the net gains of quick amortization have been great enough to override its faults . The current loss in taxes will probably be made up eventually by taxes on expanded corporate incomes , just as the federal tax yield has kept increasing because of past expansions . Moreover , if the Government had built new plants itself , it would probably have lost far more when it sold the plants . ( Many Government plants built during World War II were sold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Homer Capehart has already introduced a bill to make quick amortization permanent , and extend it to all industries , whether necessary for defense or not . There are some obstacles to any such blanket extension . The biggest is that the immediate loss in tax revenue would be far more than the Treasury could stand . Tax experts put it at $2 billion the first year of such a plan and as high as $10 billion in the fifth year . Tax losses during the write-off period would never be recouped from many industries after the equipment was paid for . They would merely buy new items of equipment each year as old ones were written off .
