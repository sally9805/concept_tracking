" The passengers remained calm , and stayed aboard the disabled train while firemen under Deputy Chief Edward extinguished the cable and generator fires . Railroad power in both directions was off until 2:55 P. M. At 3:02 P. M. , a seven-car southbound train from Dover Plains , N. Y. , drew alongside .
