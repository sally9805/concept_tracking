Names make news . Last week these names made this news : Novelist Ernest Hemingway , 54 , fervent apostle of Theodore Roosevelt 's philosophy of living life up to the hilt , has never numbered love of airplanes among his enthusiasms . When he left his home in Cuba ( and his 25 cats ) last year to revisit Africa after a lapse of two decades , he traveled by steamship . To reach a base camp on the rolling plains of British East Africa , the husky author and his fourth wife , Mary Welsh Hemingway , bumped painfully through rough country by truck . <P> But once on safari , Hemingway met and began to admire an African bush pilot named Roy Marsh . In a recent letter to a New York friend , Mrs. Hemingway described Hemingway 's all-out conversion to the air age : " Poppa is so keen on scouting in the Ndege Swahili for airplane at 600 or something shillings a half day about $84 , which includes bumps and rolls and swooping down on the deck and wing-brushing the chulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for gin and cabbage . . . " <P> When Hemingway broke camp after five months of hunting and writing and set out for Africa 's east coast to fish , he hired Pilot Marsh and his four-place Cessna . Last week Pilot Marsh left Nairobi for an African village named Masindi , planning to circle the spectacular Murchison Falls of the Victoria Nile on the way . But Marsh and the Hemingways never arrived at Masindi . A B.Q.A.C. plane , diverted from its route to search for them , found the Cessna in trees near the falls and reported that there was no sign of life to be seen . <P> The world assumed that Hemingway , one of the most accident-prone of famous men ( he absorbed 237 separate and distinct pieces of metal as an ambulance driver on Italy 's Piave front during World War I , has an artificial kneecap , bears scars from a World War II automobile accident , a collapsing ceiling and innumerable other mishaps ) , was dead . Newspapers all over the world ran scare headlines and obituaries , Havana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow . <P> The next day it turned out that indestructible Poppa was still alive . In its forced landing ( made to avoid a flock of huge jungle birds ) , the Cessna had damaged nothing but its undercarriage . Its three occupants clambered down cliffs to the crocodile-infested river , while clouds of mosquitoes whined about them . As night fell , they built a fire to keep curious elephants at bay . One elephant , Hemingway said later , " was silhouetted twelve paces away , listening to my wife snore . " When he woke her , she said , " ' I never snore . You 've got a fixation about " it . ' I said , ' So has the elephant . ' " <P> Next day the three castaways thumbed a ride in a passing launch ( full of tourists ) and were taken to Butiaba , on the shore of Lake Albert . The Hemingways climbed into another plane-which not only crashed but burned on the takeoff . Again they escaped serious harm : Hemingway got out with a cut head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after cautious traveling by automobile , they settled down for a bit of rest in the town of Entebbe , in Uganda . " I feel wonderful , " cried Hemingway , clutching a stalk of bananas and a bottle of gin . " I think my luck she is running very good . "
