As the fighting tapered off in the Middle East last week ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , the oilmen of the free world faced up to a huge problem : How can the West be supplied with all the oil it needs ? Some 25% of the free world 's oil-and 80% of Western Europe 's supply-has been coming from the oilfields of the Middle East . Last week , as a result of bombing , sabotage and plain self-defense , the flow of some 1,700,000 bbls. out of total export production of 2,600,000 bbls. a day had been cut off or disrupted , at least temporarily , and the prospects were that the flow of a few hundred thousand more barrels might be cut off . <P> Egypt 's Suez Canal , which channels 1,200,000 bbls. daily to Europe from Persian Gulf fields , has been completely closed . The hulks of at least 15 vessels ( including the dredges and some of the biggest salvage ships ) , most of them scuttled by the Egyptians , clog the waterway . The El Firdan railway bridge also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing the canal : more than a month . Says one shipping expert : " It all depends on who is going to do the unplugging . If it 's a crash program under the Americans , it might take six weeks . If it 's the British and French , it might take three months . If it 's the Egyptians , the job may never be done . " <P> Britain 's Iraq Petroleum pipeline , running from Iraq to the Mediterranean , has been blown up in so many places in Syria that its 500,000-bbl. daily flow has been completely shut off . If and when Britain resumes diplomatic relations with Syria , Britain may be able to pump oil at 40% capacity by using stations in Iraq ; restoring the line to full capacity may take six months or longer . <P> Trans-Arabian Pipe Line Co. ( 100% U.S. owned ) , which pumps 350,000 bbls. daily from Arabian-American Oil Co. fields to the Mediterranean , is still operating . But last week the Saudi Arabian government ordered Aramco to suspend all shipments to Britain and France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of the pipeline , another 110,000 bbls. daily loaded on tankers in the Persian Gulf . <P> <P> Rations &; Noses . All told , Western Europe has only enough oil on hand for five weeks . To conserve it , Great Britain has already started rationing oil by cutting consumer supplies 10% at the distributor level ; France began rationing gasoline by restricting all pleasure travel and tourism . Other European nations are also feeling the pinch . <P> Some oilmen expect the oil-rich Arab nations to come to terms soon and get the oil flowing again , since they are losing heavily . Iraq is losing about $450,000 daily because it can not move its oil , has had to cut production at its Kirkuk field drastically ; Syria sacrifices $50,000 daily in pipeline earnings alone ; Saudi Arabia gets an estimated 85% of its income from oil ( some $290 million in 1955 ) . On the other hand , as one old Middle East hand grumbled last week , " You can never really depend on the Arabs ' not hurting themselves . They 're always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
