The strange , other-worldly world of antimatter is taking shape in the minds of men . Last week Dr. Emilio Segr of the University of California showed the first bubble-chamber picture of an anti-neutron-or rather , a place where an antineutron could be proved to have been . <P> The great bevatron at Berkeley creates antiprotons ( protons with negative charges , in fair quantities . When they hit particles of ordinary matter-protons , neutrons , etc. - they generally annihilate themselves and their targets , both turning into weightless energy and neutrinos . About a fortnight ago an antiproton observed by Dr. Segr and Dr. Wilson M. Powell behaved differently . It entered Dr. Segr 's bubble chamber , which is filled with liquid propane on the point of boiling , and made its normal , slightly curving trail of tiny bubbles ( see cut ) . Suddenly the trail stopped , and a " star " of four diverging bubble trails appeared a few inches ahead . <P> Star of Suicides . Dr. Segr has no doubt about what happened . The antiproton , he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in such a way that the collision produced one ordinary neutron and one antineutron . These two particles differ only in their magnetic properties . Neither has any electric charge , and therefore they left no bubble trails . The neutron shot out of the picture undetected , but the antineutron hit a carbon atom in the propane and committed double suicide with one of its protons or neutrons . The atom disintegrated , leaving a star of bubble trails made by pi mesons . Anti-neutrons have been detected electronically , but this was the first time that one of them has shown up in a bubble picture where its behavior could be studied in some detail . <P> The study of antimatter , says Segr , is a new branch of physics whose interests reach from atomic nuclei to the universe . Scientists can now create all the antiparticles they need to build up atoms of antimatter . They have anti-neutrons , antiprotons and antielectrons ( positrons ) . Theoretically , it should be possible to put together antiatoms with negative ( not positive ) nuclei at their centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Segr says that this stunt is difficult and probably will not be accomplished for some time . <P> Anti-Gravity . Another long-range problem is to find out whether antiparticles have antigravity . Some theorists think that they do . repelling ordinary matter instead of attracting it in the normal way . Physicist Segr thinks this unlikely , but he says that the question of anti-gravity can not be answered conclusively without an actual experiment . One way would be to isolate anti-neutrons and observe whether they rise in the earth 's gravitational field instead of falling as neutrons do . This experiment looks difficult , and Dr. Segr fears that it may not be accomplished for another generation . <P> The biggest problem of all is whether the universe contains large quantities of antimatter . Since the two kinds of matter destroy each other in microseconds , there is no antimatter on earth , and probably none in the local Milky Way galaxy , but Segr is not so sure about the distant galaxies scattered through space . They are so far apart that they would not normally bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter .
