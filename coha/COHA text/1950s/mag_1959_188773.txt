In a barren place surrounded by the lush abundance of California 's San Joaquin Valley live the 300 Negro men , women and children of Teviston . Most of the family heads went to the valley from Oklahoma , Texas and Arkansas some 20 years ago as migrant farm workers , pinched their dollars , and with earnest pride bought their own land on a sandy alkali flat and called it home . The neighboring town and country were nourished by huge water projects and irrigation systems . Other valley towns thrived , but Teviston never amounted to much because it had no water supply of its own . To get their water , Teviston people had to go to nearby Pixley or Earlimart and haul it back in battered milk cans and oil drums . They measured their status by the number of cans and drums that they could acquire . <P> For years , some of Teviston 's leaders dreamed of digging a deep well and creating a water district of their own , but cash and hope were scarce . Then , five years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missionary Baptist Preacher Robert Daniels began talking up the idea . They got Bard McAllister , a representative of the American Friends Service Committee , to come over from Visalia to help . For four years McAllister worked and argued with the people , tried to explain how a community effort could bring running water into their homes . <P> At length , Teviston voted to create the water district , even though the assessed valuation on their land was so low that a bond issue seemed out of the question . Still , Teviston hired a lawyer , and the people emptied their pockets , begged loans from banks , floated a tiny ( $7,800 ) bond issue . Even after the deep well was dug , the hard-pressed laborers had to dig down for more money to help pay for equipment and water lines . A few bluntly refused : " I 'll believe it when I see the water , " grumbled one . <P> Early one morning last week , when the other valley towns were canopied with lights and tinsel , a big trailer truck lumbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads of the drab alkali flat , and deposited its cargo on an empty lot . Ragged children and rheumy old men and women with babies shuffled over , and some men pushed forward and gently laid their hands on the new thing . The Rev. Mr. Daniels took off his hat , bowed his head and said : " Father , thank thee for this wonderful blessing . " <P> For the children this week there were few toys , little tinsel-only one Christmas tree ( at the church ) in the whole community . But the 300 Negroes of Teviston had a promise of bounty that seemed greater than all the growing things in the green valley : fresh water that would run to every house in Teviston from the deep well on the empty lot . And standing over the well like a monument , was the gift ( sold at half price by one company , installed at no charge by another ) that they had given to each other-the pride of the new Teviston Water District-a big , blue , beautiful pump .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
