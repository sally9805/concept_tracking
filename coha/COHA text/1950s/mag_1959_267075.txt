The U.S. theater , known as the fabulous invalid for generations , was in a particularly palsied state in the 1840s . Sniffed a young Brooklyn Eagle critic named Walt Whitman : " Bad taste carries the day with hardly a pleasant point to mitigate its coarseness . " New York 's Park Theater , for one , was fast approaching the day when patrons sat on bare benches , watching rats fight the actors for stage center . <P> In this atmosphere arrived an unlikely heroine : a strong-jawed , 26-year-old matron named Anna Cora Mowatt . Anna 's lawyer-husband had broken down physically and financially , and Anna blithely set out to recoup by writing a play . Fashion , her maiden effort , ran a respectable string of performances at the Park in 1845 , and launched Author Mowatt on a heady career as an actress . It also gave the U.S. its first home-grown play of any success . <P> At Manhattan 's off-Broadway Royal Playhouse , Anna 's little breadwinner is on the boards again , in its first New York revival since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a blush , Fashion trots out the family Tiffany , a nouveau riche clan headed by a mother given to haughty generalizations on the conduct of the " ee-light " and a father whose financial eminence is largely due to his skill at forgery . The Tiffanys hope to marry their daughter off to a French count , who. of course , turns out to be bogus ; the Tiffanys ' unprepossessing servant girl emerges as the daughter of Adam Trueman . a bewhiskered . cane-thumping farmer of great wealth and rectitude . <P> Half the plot is carried forward through asides ( " Had I but known this maiden 's true station . . . " ) , and when the stage crew needs time to shift scenery , the present production throws in an irrelevant song . All in all , the revival proves that passable 19th century satire can make for delightful 20th century farce .
