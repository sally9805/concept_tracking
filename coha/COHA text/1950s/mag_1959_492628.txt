" The verdicts rendered by juries in personal-injury cases today are too small , " he said . " We must seek more adequate awards .

In Brooklyn , a mother has claimed her nineyear-old son was " afflicted by strange sex urges " after being treated with male sex hormones . She , too , has demanded $1,000,000 . In the District of Columbia an unemployed woman suffered a penicillin reaction after a routine treatment for gonorrhea . She has filed suit for $2,000,000 . Currently it is estimated that similar malpractice claims arc being filed at the rate of at least 6000 and possibly as many as 9000 a year . According to the American Medical Association , one out of every seven doctors in the United States has been sued . In New York and the District of Columbia the ratio is one out of five . In California it is one out of four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice and service , its pride in its accomplishments , this has been completely incredible . " Of all professions in the world , " asked Dr. Dwight Murray , a past president of the A.M.A. , ' ' how could this have happened to us ? " To a large extent , the rise in malpractice suits has paralleled the nationwide rise in automobile-accident claims and personal-injury litigation of all kinds , with juries increasingly inclined to award higher and higher judgments to the claimants . But in malpractice , medical experts insist that many of the suits have been filed  --  and won  --  without any clear sign of negligence on the part of the doctor . Until recently this situation made no sense to doctors , and accordingly some of them reacted with anger , bitter recriminations and blind rage . They struck out at suing patients , accusing them as selfish , money-hungry ingrates . They denounced as treacherous and unethical any brother physicians who dared to testify in a patient 's behalf . They blasted patients ' attorneys as ambulance chasers and shysters , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few medical leaders , however , have taken a different view .

They have forced many of us to take a long , careful look at ourselves and find our weaknesses .

Instead , in a high percentage of cases , he turns out to be a man who may be technically skilled , but who has little love or respect for his patients and whose past record is dotted with examples of sloppy medical practice . The hospital that is the target for a high , rate of suits is rarely the glorified shrine of science , skill and unselfish teamwork . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center for political skulduggery , malicious gossip and constant bickering among doctors , nurses and hospital officials . Furthermore , the typical patient who sues for malpractice is not the average innocent citizen who has been wronged and then reluctantly  --  and for the first time in his life  --  calls on a lawyer to obtain justice . Rather , in most instances , he is an individual who has a less-than-average intelligence rating , who expects the impossible from his doctor and often has a long record of lawsuits against department stores , streetcar companies , neighbors , friends and relations . There are , of course , exceptions . Modern medicine has real and inescapable dangers . Even the most warmhearted , skillful , scrupulously careful physician can make a mistake . In even the best hospital , with the most loyal and dedicated stall. , something can go wrong . Even the most intelligent , reasonable , unbellictev patient Call be the victim of negligence . But such accidents are unusual . These linclings  --  based on searching investigations into the causes of malpractice suits  --  have proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malpractice claims are unjustified nuisance suits . They have proved equally unnerving to attorneys who were convinced that all malpractice claims are based on obvious negligence . For the first time , however , they offer hope that the real causes of the malpractice problem may have been discovered and that something can be done about it . Unquestionably the malpractice problem has become one of the most serious in the modern practice of medicine . Medical authorities have described it as shocking , humiliating and dangerous . One Los Angeles hospital official stated only two years ago , " The situation is becoming acute in many parts of the country , but in Los Angeles it is already intolerable . " Last year the head of a special A.M.A. committee claimed , " The situation now has become critical and is very nearly out of control . " As one indication of the growing seriousness of the problem , medical leaders point to the change in malpractice insurance , the form of insurance to protect a doctor from financial loss in a malpractice suit . Thirty years ago , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary . or they took out a policy which cost them about twenty or thirty dollars a year . " There was n't any need for greater protection , " says one authority . " In those days it was a rare jury which found a doctor guilty , and which awarded a judgment of as much as a thousand dollars , " Now only the most foolhardy physician would dare practice without insurance protecting him against judgments of $100,000 , and certain specialists carry as much as $300,000 or even $500,000 . The premiums for such policies have increased steadily during the past decade , sometimes jumping by as much as 100 per cent or more in one year . and now may cost a doctor $400 to $600 a year  --  and even higher for such high-risk specialties as certain types of surgery , radiology and anesthesiology . In addition , some insurance companies have claimed that their losses in this field have been too high , and they have abruptly stepped out of the medical-malpractice business . " If this trend continues , " said Dr. Joseph F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem may reach the stage where the question will be not how much a physician has to pay for such insurance coverage but whether he can obtain it at any price . " Similar difficulties are now besetting the nation 's hospitals , which are likewise prime targets for malpractice suits , as well as dentists , osteopaths and chiropractors . No accurate figures are available to demonstrate the dollars-and-cents size of the malpractice problem . An estimate by Joseph Linder , of New York . probably the nation 's top actuarial expert in the field , indicates that for physicians and hospitals alone the costs for malpractice claims  --  including court judgments , outof-court settlements . investigation expenses and legal fees  --  now total at least $45.000,000 a year and may be as high as $50.000,000. insurance companies have reacted to these losses by raising their premium rates to the doctors , who in turn have eventually passed the expense on to their patients . But this first cost of the malpractice problem is relatively inconsequential . It represents much less than l per cent of the nation 's medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their patients , has been the effect on the practice of medicine . In some areas , physicians are calling for additional diagnostic tests even though there is no clear medical reason for these procedures . For instance , in the treatment of a patient who has bumped or bruised an arm or leg , even without the slightest sign of a broken bone , many doctors are now calling for complete X rays of the injured limb . " This may add twenty or thirty dollars to the bill of every such patient , " says Dr. James W. Watts , president of the District of Columbia Medical Society , " but in one case out of a thousand it may protect you from a malpractice suit . " In many other cases , doctors are insisting on medical consultation , even though there are no positive medical grounds for seeking additional advice . Here again the added cost  --  another twenty-five to fifty dollars  --  goes on the patient 's bill . In still other cases doctors are demanding additional laboratory tests , additional hospitalization and even additional nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sued for negligence . Numerous authorities have also declared that the fear of lawsuits has forced many doctors into giving up many valuable though somewhat hazardous procedures , has slowed medical research and limited the use of some dangerous last-ditch methods even on dying patients . If this is true , it has been impossible to prove . Last year , in a survey covering medical centers in twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia , it was possible to find such a change in only one significant case  --  the use of spinal anesthesia . For reasons which are not altogether clear , the courts have apparently decided that this form of anesthesia is not merely relatively safe but absolutely safe ; accordingly , if there is any accident , it follows that the doctor must have been negligent . Because of this attitude and the scores of husky malpractice judgments based on it , the use of spinal anesthesia has nearly vanished in some hospitals . Some of these changes  --  the additional use of X rays , the additional use of consultants , and the limited use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate good of most patients , and they may or may not have come about without the threat of lawsuits . But there is one other effect which is clearly the result of the malpractice problem , and which is unquestionably harming medical care . This is the growing fear among tens of thousands of doctors that they may be sued and found guilty of negligence even though they committed no negligence . Typical is the view of one California doctor , eminently qualified and skilled , highly experienced , uniformly respected by his patients and his colleagues , nationally honored for his achievements and rated one of the finest general practitioners in the country . " I have never been sued , " he told a group of newspapermen last winter , " but now I realize that I 'm not immune . It could happen to me . Now , whenever a new patient comes into my office , I ask myself , ' Is this the fellow who 's going to sue me ? ' and , God help me , I 'm beginning to decide my treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , but on what will look best in court . " This attitude , increasingly apparent all over the United States , is based in considerable part on a misunderstanding of what malpractice is and what it is not . Malpractice does not mean a doctor 's failure to render the very best care to his patient . It does not mean an honest error in diagnosis . It does not mean a failure to cure or produce satisfactory relief . Instead , malpractice means simply the failure of a physician to apply average skill and take average precautions in rendering his professional services . If he provides this middle-ground variety of care , he can not be legally blamed no matter whether his patient improves , worsens , lives or dies . This is what the highest courts have ruled . What has happened in actual practice , however , has sometimes been startlingly different . " There is now an alarming tendency , " says R. Crawford Morris , a Cleveland expert on malpractice law , " For the courts to rule for the patient who is apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the doctor , but because they feel sorry for the patient . " This ruling  --  sometimes called the " rule of sympathy " ? seems to be a throwback 10 the Code of Haninnirabi , written Babylon almost 4001 years ago . Linder the code , a surgeon who cured his pat ient should win ten shekels of silver , but it ' the patient died , the surgeon should lose both his hands at the wrist . If the surgeon flubbed an operation and killed the son of a nobleman. then the surgeon 's son should be killed . This may or may not have prevented malpractice , but it unquestionably limited surgery . In this country . the ground rules on malpractice law have been based on early decisions in the English courts . For example , an English surgeon named J. Mort was sued in the year 1174 on the charge that he had bungled the treatment of a patient 's hand , which thereafter was " so impaired that it was maimed to his injury and damage . " In this case , cited as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor in England . the surgeon escaped on a legal technicality . At the same time , the King 's Bench laid down a vital rule . " If the surgeon does so well as he can and employs all his diligence to the curt , " the court stated . " it is not right that he should be held culpable . " This concept was widely followed in England and later in America . Here it was bulwarked by similar decisions , including one important ruling handed down in 1897 by William Howard Taft , then a Federal circuit judge and later President of the United States . " A physician is not a warrantor of cures , " Judge Taft said . " If a failure to cure were held to be evidence , however slight , of negligence on the part of the physician or surgeon causing the bad result , few would be courageous enough to practice the healing art , for they would have to assume financial responsibility for nearly all the ills that flesh is heir to . " During the nineteenth century and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while these seemingly reasonable rules were in force , there was essentially no such thing as a malpractice problem . There were more suits and higher judgments , but these appeared to be increasing generally in accordance with the rise in population and the higher cost of living . Furthermore , in private , most doctors indicated that those of their colleagues who were financially lambasted in malpractice suits were precisely the scoundrels who deserved such punish-ment , Medical spokesmen generally agreed that some accidents would always occur so long as medicine was practiced by human beings on human beings . " Moreover , " says Joseph Stetler , head of the A.M.A. 's legal department , " it has never been our purpose , nor will it ever become our purpose , to try to cover up for the doctor or prevent provision of adequate compensation in cases of this type . " In the 1930 's , the situation began to change . California , then ranking only sixth in population , suddenly surpassed all other states in the number of malpractice suits . Similar jumps were soon noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District of Columbia . " Patients are demonstrating shocking avarice and loss of moral fiber , " an attorney for a Midwestern medical society charged . The problem continued to grow ominously until about 1942 , abated slightly during the years of World War II , picked up again in 1946 and then skyrocketed , in Washington , D.C. , for example , twenty malpractice actions were recorded in 1938 , forty-seven in 1948 , fifty-five in 1950 , 128 in 1955 , and 146 in 1956 . In New York , the group malpractice-insurance plan covering more than 11,000 doctors reported losses of about 5547,000 in 1946 and 51,713,000 in 1956 . Interestingly , British physicians working under a national medical system reported equally startling remarkable situation ? Part of it could be clearly attributed to the advance in medicine itself . " We 're no longer in the era of those nice , safe , useless pink pills for pale people , " says a St. Louis doctor . " Now we 've got drugs that really work  --  potent agents like the sulfa drugs , the antibiotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain and the heart for diseases that once were uncurable . All these new weapons are more effective , but they 're also more dangerous . " A Philadelphia physician adds , " With these modern treatments , our patients do n't die . Maybe they do n't recover completely , but they stay alive  --  at least long enough to go see a lawyer . " A second part of the problem could obviously be blamed on real negligence on the part of the doctor . " Unfortunately , " claims an official of the American College of Surgeons , " some doctors  --  either to save face or to make more money  --  will refuse to accept their limitations , They do not call for help when it is needed . They undertake procedures for which they arc not trained . " A New Yorker put the matter somewhat more bluntly . " Legally . " he said , " any doctor can do anything in medicine , and some doctors are damn fools enough to try it . " But these two obvious explanations could account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were other facts which seemed totally baffling . First , in this new epidemic of malpractice claims , the highly trained specialist  --  the man presumably least likely to make mistakes  --  was actually sued at least as often as the general practitioner . Second , in most cases of known negligence  --  when the doctor had made a serious mistake , and the patient was aware of it  --  no malpractice claim ever was instituted . " As a matter of fact , " a Chicago surgeon confided recently , " when I 've told my patients that I 've made a mistake , they do n't even get angry . They actually seem to feel sorry for me . " Third , careful appraisals of hundreds of malpractice claims indicated that in an appreciable proportion  --  the estimates range from 10 per cent in some areas to 90 per cent in others  --  there had been absolutely no technical negligimee . " These arc nuisance suits , " charged a California county-medical-society official , " They are medical hum raps . They prove that a doctor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sited successfully  --  for malpractice . " During the past few years it has been the growing number of these so-called nuisance suits  --  without any evident sign of technical malpractice  --  which first confused many medical men , then created acute annoyance and irritation and finally built up a storm of outrage . This anger was expressed in a barrage of free-swinging attacks against patients , lawyers and even some physicians . " 1 tried to get my medical friends to slow down , " says William Martin , legal counsel for the New York State Medical Society , " I tried to tell them that there was more than purely technical malpractice  --  that there was also psychological malpractice , the failure to treat patients with kindness and sympathy and understanding . I fear I was not very convincing at the time . " Another experienced attorney , Howard Hassard , legal counsel for the California Medical Association , likewise urged a more calm and reasonable approach . " Any program that is unrealistic . unobjective or retaliatory against the public or any of its segments might just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It simply will not work . Worse , it will probably backfire and aggravate the problem . " Such advice was generally not heeded . Some doctors vengefully called for a blacklist containing the name of every patient who had ever sued for malpractice . In many centers , they called for special legislation requiring a patient to forfeit a bond if he lost a malpractice suit . Some demanded that lawyers be " educated " so that they would refuse to represent patients , and others urged special laws making it unethical for a lawyer to bring suit against a physician . Many of these suggestions apparently came from physicians who were convinced that every ' V/ malpractice attorney must be an ambulance chaser . Actually , few such lawyers hail to go out and find clients ; most were deluged with suit-minded patients and could accept only a small percentage of the available eases . One of the most widely heard proposals was to issue only small malpractice-insurance policies . " If we carry a policy for only a thousand dollars or so , " it was suggested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sue us for more . " This belief was permanently dispelled when a doctor in Oakland , California , was sued for an allegedly botched plastic-surgery operation . The doctor carried a malpractice policy for only a few thousand dollars . The jury found him guilty oi negligence and awarded his badly scarred patient a judgment of 5115,000 . The doctor lost his lifelong savings , his home , his car and even his practice . Some doctors and some lawyers proposed that a new form of insurance be established to be taken out and paid for by the patients themselves , somewhat like air-travel insurance . Under such a program , which is now receiving serious consideration , any injured patient could receive appropriate compensation without being required to prove that a doctor had been negligent . Within some medical circles it was suggested that heavy punishment be doled out to physicians who dared to criticize the work of their colleagues , especially within the hearing of patients . " The precipitating cause of a majority of all malpractice actions is found in the unwise comments or criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians , " it was claimed by the late Dr. Louis J. Regan , of Los Angeles , one of the first medical experts to study malpractice . These damaging comments include such remarks as , " What butcher performed that operation ? " or " How in the world could he have missed it ? " or " ft 's a shame you did n't come to me first , " or " You mean , vour other doctor forgot to test you for diabetes ? " or simply , " Wow ! Where did you get that scar ? " One of the classic examples of this kind of criticism was reported by J. Joseph Herbert , chief legal counsel for the Michigan State Medical Society . It concerned a middle-aged woman who called on a prominent Detroit physician and asked him to examine an abdominal burn caused by a slip of an electric-cautery instrument . " What doctor did that to you ? " he asked . " You could sue and collect for a burn like that . Who was the physician ? " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out in court , the doctor was Found guilty of negligence , and the patient was awarded 54500 . As part of the general reaction to the whole malpractice situation , ninny if not most physicians felt they could cope with the problem in only two ways . One was to ignore it completely , presumably in the belief that if they did n't look at it , it would go away . The other was to cloak the entire problem in silence , decline to discuss any part of it with patients , lawyers , insurance men , reporters or anyone else , and refuse to testify against a fellow physician in court under any circumstances  --  a policy which soon became assailed as medicine 's " conspiracy of silence . " If either of these two techniques had any helpful effect , this was not immediately apparent . Instead , the two approaches came close to making the doctors cut their collective professional throats .
