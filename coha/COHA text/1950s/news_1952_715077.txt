txt The cease-fire negotiated between Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio at Columbia University on Morningside Heights last Sept. 12 ended today when the Senator blasted the General for inviting Martin P. Durkin , a Democratic labor union official , to be his Secretary of Labor . This development marked the first break in the Republican ranks since the election and a clouding of the relations between the two most powerful men in the party . President-elect Eisenhower issued no statement in response to the Taft communique and none of his aides showed any enthusiasm for following the Senator into print . However , a careful check of that small number of Republican // Senators who were not " traveling " or on vacation indicated considerable support for the idea that a President-elect had the right to appoint anybody he liked to his Cabinet , even Democrats . Indeed , while most of these Republican Senators were disinclined i to referee an Eisenhower-Taft fight in public , almost all those reached predicted that Mr. Durkin would be confirmed when his appointment reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Durkin , however , so much as at General Eisenhower and at Herbert Brownell Jr. , New York Republican leader who has been a confidant of Governor Dewey and was recently named by the President-elect as his Attorney General . It was also aimed at the procedure followed in the selection of the department heads whose legislation and appropriations must pass through Congress . ' Tradition ' Violated The background of the state-1 merit by Senator Taft , so far as could be determined here today , was as follows : General Eisenhower asked Mr. Taft to submit a list of suggestions for the new Cabinet and he did so , directly to the General and also through Thomas Coleman of Madison , Wis. , the Taft floor manager in the Ohio Senator 's fight for the Republican Presidential nomination at Chicago . This list contained two suggestions for the post of Secretary of Labor , Dean Clarence E. Manion ) of the Notre Dame law school , and former Senator John A. Danaher , Republican of Connecticut . Senator Taft felt that the General should follow what he regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , that before any announcement is made , the Republican Senator from the home state of the man in question , and the Republican Senator in charge of the Senate committee in the appointee 's field , should be consulted . Thus , in the case of Mr. Durkin , Mr. Taft felt that he , as the next chairman of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee , and Senator Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois  --  Mr. Durkin 's home state ? should have been asked what they thought of the appointment before it was made . This , however , apparently was not done . Mr. Brownell did check the Durkin appointment with the next Republican Governor of Illinois , William G. Stratton , but not with Senators Dirksen or Taft . A Previous Disapproval There is reason for believing that Mr. Taft was not amused by this procedure , Though he had " gone along " with most of General Eisenhower 's Cabinet appointments , none of his own nominees had actually been named , with the possible exception of Ezra Taft Benson to the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his appointments with Mr. Taft when tliey met in New York after the election . For example , the General told him that he was considering John Foster Dulles and John J. McCloy , former United States High Commissioner for Germany , for the post as Secretary of State , and Mr. Taft indicated his preference for Mr. Dulles , who was later named . However , in the case of the Secretaryship of the Treasury , the procedure added considerably to the Senator 's displeasure . Indeed , there is some reason for believing that the facts in this case contributed to Mr. Taft 's sharp statement on the Durkin case , Byrd Had Been Urged Mr. Taft strongly urged General Eisenhower to appoint Senator Harry F. Byrd , Democrat of Virginia , to this post . General Eisenhower is understood to have indicated that he was committed to another man and to have protested mildly against the idea of naming a Democrat . He did not , however , tell Mr. Taft who his appointee would be . Later , the General selected George M. Humphrey , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was not on the Senator 's list though he was a personal friend of Mr. Taft and acceptable to him . In this cases Mr. Taft is represented as having felt that he should have had a chance to talk over the appointment because Mr. Humphrey was an Ohioan . Finally , Mr. Taft was not happy about the fact that Mr. Brownell , a Dewey man who helped to defeat Mr. Taft for the Republican nomination both in 1948 and 1952 , received the job of screening the Cabinet selections , nor was he overjoyed by the ' further fact the Cabinet , as completed , showed considerable independence -- to say the least  --  of Mr. Taft 's suggestions . Accordingly , when the Cabinet post in the field Of Mr. Taft 's special interest  --  labor  --  was given to a man who favored the election of Gov , Adel E. Stevenson of Illinois and , what was in some ways worse ? to the Senator 's way of thinking ? to a man who favored repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act , the senior Senator from Ohio ended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made it clear that he agreed with the recom-i mendation of the American Federation of Labor that the ley Act be repealed . Yesterday , however , he was quoted as saying he believed the law could be amended to the satisfaction of labor . Mr. Taft called associates here last night when he first heard about the appointment and considered making a statement then . He decided , however , to wait until this morning , but sleep and reflection did not change his mind . There was a great deal of talk here this evening about " the end of the Eisenhower-Taft honey'moon , " and of a " rift " in the party , etc. , but most observers were inclined to believe that the incident merely brought to the surface ? soon rather than late  --  an uneasy relationship that was there from the beginning . Legislators Wary Moreover , it was noticeable tonight that few legislators were eager to jump into the battle on Mr. Taft 's side and nobody was volunteering to try to block confirmations . Senator Eugene ? Millikin of Colorado , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supporter of Senator Taft for the Republican nomination , said he had " no objection to the appointment of a Democrat " in the labor post . He added that he knew nothing about Mr. Durkin 's record and therefore could not comment on his merits . Senator George D. Aiken , Republican of Vermont , who ranks just under Senator Taft on the Labor Committee , said it was " wise to recognize organized labor in the Cabinet " and added that he ' would not want to pass judgment on Mr. Durkin without hearing all the facts . Representative Joseph W. Mar- ' tin Jr. , Republican of Massachusetts , who will be Speaker of the House in the Eighty-third Congress . when informed of the Taft statement , said that he thought he could deal with the situation in a phrase : " No comment . " Senator Arthur V. Watkins , Republican of Utah , another legislator who usually supports Mr. Taft , also declared that he did not know enough about the facts in the case SENATE APPROVAL , SEEN FOR DURKIN // to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no comment " Senators were saying privately , however , was that they would have had no violent objections if the Senator from Ohio had slept on his statement for two or three more nights . Durkin 's Account Meanwhile Mr. Durkin , a sort of innocent bystander in the whole case , spent most of the day at his home in Chevy Chase , a suburb of this city , answering the telephone and explaining that , honestly , he was n't mad at anybody , not even Senator Taft . As a matter of fact he still seemed slightly confused about how he got into the act in the first place . The story he told was as follows : He was here last Friday when Mr. Brownell called from New York and asked him if he knew who he ( Brownell ) was . Mr. Durkin said he gave Mr. Brownell his own definition 9 what position Mr. Brownell held ( he did not say he was right ) . But whatever he did say satisfied the caller enough so that Mr. Durkin ' was invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone Mr. Durkin asked Mr. Brownell if he knew he was a . Democrat . Mr. Brownell did . Mr. Durkin also told him that he had agreed with the A. F. L. position in favor of the election of Governor Stevenson , and that he had voted for Mr. Stevenson . Nevertheless he was asked to come ahead to New York and he went up the same afternoon . At the Commodore Hotel Mr. Durkin went through all this again , assuring the Attorney General-designate that he was ? a card-carrying Democrat , but Mr. Brownell was still in the market , so they got in a cab and drove up to Morningside Heights and saw the General . There Mr. Durkin confessed his party affiliation and election preference all over again , but the General offered him the job , anyway told him , sure , to go ahead and talk it over with his wife and with his associates in his union , and let him know on Monday . On Monday Mr. Durkin said " yes , " and he was still saying " yes " tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
