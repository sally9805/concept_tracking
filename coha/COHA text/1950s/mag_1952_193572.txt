With nearly 40% of all U.S. wholesale purchases taking place at prices under their OPS ceilings , Price Boss Ellis Arnall last week made a decision . Since the ceilings no longer meant anything , Arnall thought it might be just as well to take some of them off . He prepared , accordingly , orders " temporarily " suspending the ceilings on numerous items ( hides , calfskins , tallow , lard , animal waste material , vegetable soap stock , crude cottonseed , soybean and corn oil , burlap , wool , alpaca , etc . ) . <P> Nevertheless , ex-Governor Arnall , who knows all the advantages of patronage , particularly in an election year , showed no signs of firing any of OPS 's horde of 11,796 employees , even if many of them had little left to do . Arnall 's office warned that prices might go creeping up again , so everybody would have to stand by ready to whack them if they got back to the level of the suspended ceilings .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
