The American Negro , says Zoologist Curt Stern of the University of California in Scientific American , is doomed to disappear through racial diffusion . As a group of mankind , American Negroes are relatively new . They have existed for only 300 years , and are already notably mixed . Dr. Stern figures from their blood-group makeup that about two-thirds of their genetic material ( heredity ) comes from Africa , about one-third from Europe . More than 78% of American Negroes have some non-African genes ; by 1980 there will be hardly a single U.S. Negro of pure African descent . <P> There will still be plenty of dark-skinned Negroes , but skin color , Dr. Stern points out , is a superficial characteristic rather than a dependable indicator of racial origin . The workings of heredity produce many dark-skinned Negroes with thin lips and many light-skinned ones with thick lips . One type is as mixed as the other , though the white population , which judges chiefly by skin color , usually considers the dark type more authentically Negro . A light-skinned Negro can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than skin color he may be strongly Negro . <P> Over the generations , Dr. Stern predicts , more light-skinned Negroes will be born , and they will tend , even at the present rate of interracial mating , to diffuse into the white population . The loss by " passing " of light-skinned individuals may leave the rest of the Negroes darker , on the average , than they are at present . On the other hand , an inflow of European genes may balance the loss and further dilute the Negro population . <P> After centuries , says Dr. Stern , most of the original African genes will be widely dispersed in the numerically dominant white population . Their incorporation will make no change except a slight darkening of the national skin . Eventually , there will be a few thousand black people in each generation , and they will probably have straight hair , thin lips and thin noses . " If some person now living , " says Dr. Stern , " could return at that distant time , he would ask in wonder : ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
