The aims of the Ford Foundation seem as vague as they are noble . But it has a lot of un-vague money to spend-more ( $30 million a year ) than any other foundation in the world . By last week it was beginning to be apparent where the Ford largesse is landing . <P> About one-third of it will go abroad , to further world peace by a kind of private Point Four program . Last week the Foundation gave $1,309,500 to the Free University of Berlin . Then Director Paul Hoffman and some of his top officials set off for a three-week tour of Europe and Asia to see what else they could do . <P> They intended to go only to countries that invited them , and take on projects not supported by any government . The projects could be anything from farm development to nutrition , if only they would help to reduce " tensions . " One tension the Foundation hopes to reduce is in the India-Pakistan area . <P> The Foundation has mapped out five fields to work in : <P> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sample grants : the Resettlement Campaign for Exiled Professionals ( $500,000 ) , the Free Russia Fund ( $200,000 ) , the American Friends Service Committee ( $500,000 ) . <P> 2 ) Freedom and Democracy .
