Only five days before the key game with Michigan , No. 2 team in the nation , gloom shrouded Army 's football field at West Point . Army 's swift halfback and 1955 team captain , Mike Zeigler , was under punishment , walking with his rifle in the barracks area instead of practicing plays . His offense : though a first-rate student and on the dean 's list , Cadet Zeigler had drunk a beer in an officers ' mess . He was stripped of his team captaincy and barred from football for the season . <P> Help came from , of all places , Belgium and the U.S. Navy . Prince Albert of Belgium , in the U.S. as the Navy 's guest , paid a courtesy call at West Point and exercised the traditional royal prerogative to request a pardon for all cadets under punishment . The amnesty freed Zeigler , and raised the odds to even money that Army would win . <P> As it turned out , neither Zeigler nor any other Army player was any help against powerful Michigan . In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had beaten the Wolverines every time . But last week Michigan counterattacked with a vengeance . Halfback Terry Barr slammed through the porous Army line for the first touchdown soon after the kickoff , then sprinted 82 yards to score a second time . Michigan added two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter . Butter-fingered Army lost eight of its nine fumbles , completed only one pass all afternoon , while Michigan romped to a 26-2 triumph . <P> Other big games ran truer to form : <P> Playing one of their rare night games , in sultry 80 Florida weather , Notre Dame blanked Miami University 14-0 . Irish Quarterback Paul Hornung , a running star in earlier games this season , turned on his passing skill , firing the forwards that scored both Notre Dame touchdowns . <P> Aerial warfare broke out in earnest in the Wisconsin-Purdue game at Lafayette , Ind. , where the two teams threw a total of 54 passes , 35 of them completed . Only one pass , by Wisconsin 's Jim Miller , was good for a touchdown . That and a field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect 1955 record ( unbeaten , untied , unscored upon ) with a 21-0 win over Pittsburgh .
