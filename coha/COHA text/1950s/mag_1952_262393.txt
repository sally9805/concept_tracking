U.S. public schools have been traditionally classless and nonsectarian . To Harvard 's James Bryant Conant , that is the way they should be . Last week , in an alarmist mood , he called the rise of private and denominational schools a menace to " our democratic unity . " <P> " There are , " said he , " many sincere Protestants , Jews and Catholics who believe that secondary education divorced from a denominational religious core is bad education . . . That such people have a right to organize their own schools I do not question . . . But to my mind , our schools should serve all creeds . . . Therefore , to use taxpayers ' money to assist private schools is , for me , to suggest that American society use its own hands to destroy itself ... A dual system of schools serves and helps to maintain group cleavages . . . " <P> Conant admits that not all parents who send their children to private ( or parochial ) schools do so for religious or " snob " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. public high schools are inadequate . To these parents Conant offers rather cold comfort : " The family will have to balance these misgivings against the advantages to the boy of mixing with all sorts of people . . . " <P> Conant 's proposed solution is not the abolition of private and parochial schools ( " This is a free country , and people will not be pushed around by educators " ) but to improve the high schools . " The false antithesis between education for the gifted and education for all American youth must be resolved . . . Then one demand for a further increase in private independent education will largely disappear . "
