Britain gave notice last week that it is , and intends to remain , one of the Big Three atomic powers . In a White Paper presented to the House of Commons , Defense Minister Lord Alexander announced that British-made atomic weapons , including atomic bombs , are being delivered to the British forces , and that the Royal Air Force is building a fleet of strategic bombers , " capable of using the atomic weapon to the fullest extent . " <P> Alexander 's statement , greeted with loud hurrahs in the London press , gave practical effect in Britain to the same " New Look " defense philosophy which atomic air power - and the need for long-range economy - have produced in the U.S. Britain 's $4.6 billion defense budget for 1954-55 will 1 ) thin out British army garrisons abroad , 2 ) invest most heavily in guided missiles , jet bombers and swept-wing fighters . Old Soldier Alexander was hopeful that the West 's defense buildup would prove a " strong deterrent to aggression . " But - and the but reverberated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by deliberate design , a global war were forced upon us , " Britain will not hesitate to hit back with atom bombs . <P> There Is No Defense . Such plain speak ing in Britain is most unfashionable . It represents a considerable victory , won in disregard of popular British opinion , for a group of professional strategists led by a famed airman : Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Cotesworth Slessor . <P> Like most strategic airmen , Sir John is convinced that atomic air power is not a tragedy but a boon , for willingness and capacity to use it will make its use un necessary . He believes that " the super sonic airplane , allied to the atomic and soon the hydrogen bomb . . . has made total war an obsolete conception . " There is no real defense against atomic air power ( " I advise you not to be unduly impressed by the stories about the wonderful guided missile that is going to shoot down all these supersonic bombers " ) . <P> Cockpit &; Goggles . Slessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school of experience . The son of a British major in the Indian army , he grew up with a cruel impediment : a " gammy leg " that kept him off the rugger field , gave him a lifelong limp . Nerve alone won his commission in the Royal Flying Corps , but once in the air , Slessor proved a topflight pilot . In the Sudan in 1916 , he swooped down on a dervish cavalry outfit , routed it with Lewis gunfire and bombs , and " by this unexpected method of assault , " wrote the official R.A.F. historian , " destroyed the enemy morale . " <P> At 56 , Jack Slessor still misses his World War I biplane . " Flying is n't nearly as much fun as it was when you had an open cockpit and goggles . " As chief of a bomber group in World War II , he was often compelled to decide how many airmen 's lives it was worth to destroy an enemy target . " He would sit down on one of the kitchen chairs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For anything up to ten minutes , he would quite literally do nothing at all . He simply sat there and thought . Everyone instinctively fell silent . Then , very quietly , he told the duty officer what to do . . . "
