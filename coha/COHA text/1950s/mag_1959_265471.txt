Wanted : TV producer to turn out 30 NBC spectaculars for Ford Motor Co . Budget : $12 million . Salary : $250,000 . <P> <P> For months the unofficial want ad buzzed along the network grapevine . Gossip said the job was going begging , and many a hopeful hotshot managed to get his name noised about as a candidate . But the yearners never had much of a chance . Last week one of the plushiest producing jobs in the television business went to CBS Vice President Hubbell Robinson Jr. , 53 , the man who had dreamed up the Ford series in the first place . <P> The new job more than eased the pain of losing out in a power squeeze at CBS-TV ( Robinson was passed over for the network presidency , then for its No. 2 spot , executive vice president ) . Said Robinson : " I will also be directly concerned with the job of creation , a thing I was getting away from at CBS . " A short , suave , Brown-educated ( ' 27 ) emigre from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the motto " Mass with Class . " and at CBS he went far toward making it work . He was responsible for Playhouse 90 , the Phil Silvers Show , Twentieth Century . He prompted Edward R. Murrow to turn radio 's Hear It Now into the television classic See It Now . <P> Always a booster of network-created programs , Robinson might be expected to feel uneasy about his defection to the growing ranks of packagers-except that his package will be so big as to constitute something of a network itself . As boss of Hubbell Robinson , Jr . Associates . Inc. he intends to try everything possible-musicals , 90-minute dramas , special events , tape and film shows from all over the world . Since he will own all the shows himself and will continue to profit from their residual income long after he pockets his hefty salary checks , Hub Robinson has latched onto a classy mass indeed .
