It was scheduled to leave the field at 11:59 P. M. from Run . way 10 , a runway that in theory should not have sent the big plane over this heavily congested area . Runway 10 has been pressed into service because of the protests oil Elizabeth residents after the earliel crashes in this city that lies astride the main air approaches to the field .

The wingt and foresection hurtled forward into the schoolyard of the Janet Memorial Home , an orphanage in which 100 children were asleep . This forepart burst into flames and the whole yard was strewn with fiery wreckage . By good for . tune the orphanage did not take fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A gen. , eral fire alarm was sounded and police and firemen from Elizabeth , Newark , Roselle , Union and ? thee near-by communities responded .

As the flames from the apartment house fire lit up the skies . crowds began gathering behind hastily formed police lines . They were angry . Many recalled the words of John C.

He had warned that another such accident would mean a march of 50,000 to 100,000 aroused persons from Elizabeth and other communities to Newark Airport . Curiously , the first word that there were any survivors at all came from Miami . A woman there reported that two relatives had telephoned her to say that they were safe . These relatives were Mrs. Pauline Bell , 48 , of Passaic , N. J. , and her daughter , Cele , 17 . Another survivor was a New I Haven priest , the Rev. Leonard T. Goode .
