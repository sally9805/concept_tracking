txt Three years ago leaders in the field of higher education became disturbed at the financial outlook confronting American colleges and universities . Although thousands of veterans were crowding the campuses , the educators recognized that the G , I. Bill had a terminal point , and that the enrollments would some day fall off . The Association of American Universities discussed the problem with the Rockefeller Foundation . Out of this conference grew a plan for a comprehensive study of the needs of Amer. ice 's 1,800 institutions of higher learning . The Rockefeller Foundation contributed $400,000 for the study ; the Carnegie Corporation $50,000 . Twelve prominent citizens  --  eight of them educators and four laymen  --  were invited to serve on a commission for the study . The presidents of Johns Hopkins University , Union College , California Institute of Technology , the University of Missouri , Stanford University and Brown University were included . Prof. John D. Millett of Columbia University served as executive director . Last week the results of the threeyear study were made public . A summary volume of 191 pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten supporting volumes have been issued The commission stresses several points that are extremely important . Our colleges and universities are in serious financial difficulty , the report brings out quite clearly . For the current year these institutions wilt need an additional $250,000,000 to operate successfully . Inflation , a drop in enrollment and expansion of educational services have added to the financial burdens . More money is needed , and needed at once . Where will it come from ? Two sources , obviously , are available : the . public and the Federal Government . The commission notes that unless the general public conies to the support of higher education to a greater extent than it has done in the past , the Federal Government may be forced to step into the picture . Already the Government provides close to $500,000,000 a year in the form of research projects , scholarships , veteran tuition grants or capital investments . The commission fears that this is a dangerous trend and may lead to dominance of the independent colleges by the Federal Government . The commission makes a strong plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private and state institutions are the strongest bulwark against Federal control of higher education . These recommendations for extended support for the colleges and universities are pro-posed : BUSINESS SUPPORT In 1950 business firms and corporations contributed approximately $50 , - 000,000 to higher education . This is a relatively new channel of private philanthropy in the United States . But , the commission holds , the rate of business and corporation support must be increased sharply . If corporations increased their contributions to only 3 per cent of net income before taxation , total corporation philanthropy would reach $1,300,000,000 . Up to 50 per cent of this might be expected to go to welfare agencies operating in those communities where a corporation has a substantial interest . Another 25 per cent might be disbursed to health agencies . And the final 25 per cent could be allocated to higher education . On that basis , the report notes , higher education would get S325,000 , - 000 annually . This sum could close the gap in higher education 's current financing  --  although it would not meet the vast range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations could provide funds for such purposes as research grants , fellowship awards , undergraduate scholarship assistance , capital funds and support of special projects on the campus . LABOR UNION SUPPORT Like corporations , the commission points out , labor unions thrive best in a democracy enlightened by the spirit of a liberal education . The unions claim a membership of 16,000,000 , and have an estimated annual income of half a billion dollars . Labor has a stake in higher education , the educators say , because of the emphasis given to freedom of inquiry and the opportunities education provides for the individual to carve out his own career in life . Forward-looking labor leaders , the report notes , now realize that it is not enough to train the children of Working families in the philosophy and technique of labor organizations . Thg labor group has much to gain in the long run from giving its cbildren the same opportunities that others enjoy . Labor in this way can contribute greatly toward equality of educational opportunity in the United States . CHURCH SUPPORT Many colleges and universities were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church affiliation . Many church groups are still helping colleges with gifts for both direct support and scholarship aid . The commission holds that through a closer Understanding colleges and churches can become a mutual source of strength ? the churches with their broad appeal can help to develop the financial support colleges need , and the colleges can help to strengthen the spiritual role that churches must fulfill in our society . Church congregations are in a particularly favorable position to de something about scholarship assistance to deserving young persons , the report suggests . They are in a position to encourage young people to go to col- ' lege , and to know the circumstances in which scholarship aid is especially needed . Many church denominations are already well launched upon this work , but the commission feels that they can do more to stimulate and finance promising young persons who ought to go to college . FOUNDATION SUPPORT Higher education owes much to foundations . These philanthropic agenCies helped colleges and universities to grow to maturity by contributing endowment funds and capital funds . Several foundation 's made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about by the famous report made by Dr. Abraham Flexner in 1910 . It is proposed that foundations provide more money to colleges and universities , particularly the new foundations established In recent years . The report estimates that there may be as many as 3,000 philanthropic foundations in the country today , with resources running into several hundred million dollars . From such large resources a variety of contributions should be forthcoming . GIFTS BY ALUMNI AND FRIENDS Colleges and universities have demonstia.ted in recent years that Substantial sums of money can be obtained on an annual , recurring basis front alumni and other individuals friendly td higher education . The commission estimates that in 1950 the colleges received $15 , - 000,000 in such . gifts . The distribution of wealth has become such as to make current donations a promising source of income . Although individual gifts may be small , in the aggregate the Contribution may be quite large . Also , the body of college alumni in the United States is growing in relation to the total population . These persons should have an active interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their particular colleges and universities than the general public has . But more than mere token contributions need to be encouraged . Alumni and friends must realize that only when a gift is of fairly generous size does it become truly helpful . LOCAL SUPPORT The relationship between an institution of higher learning and its inunediate environment should be close and mutually advantageous . Communities benefit by the presence of a college or university in their midst and , in turn , institutions ; reflect the quality of their environment . Accordingly , the report suggests that a college or University which succeeds in carrying its education to the community will gain support A community that appreciates the value Of higher education Will hot fail to finance it . * * * These various sources of . income are not all of the same importance , But all of them are valuable . No one of them is an adequate answer to the need for more income . The linsWe ? Bee ' it derveloping as many of them as possible and in such balance as economic circumstances allow .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
