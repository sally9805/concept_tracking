txt  | We are approaching a situation of this kind in the operatic world , where the repertory of the most popular singers seems to be contracting every year . The repertory of both actors and singers was much wider in the past . We are astonished at the number and the range of the parts played , for example , by Emil Devrient , the greatest German actor of about the middle of the nineteenth century . And the singers who nowadays trot all over the globe singing nothing but the same four or five Wagner parts for ever and ever seem pretty poor specimens compared with Lilli Lehmann , whose repertory ran to nearly 120 parts of every imaginable kind , Adam , Bellini , Auber , Beethoven , Dittersdorf , Wagner , Verdi , Donizetti , Offenbach , Suppe , and a score of others being equally within her scope . We shall have to accept as the normal thing in the future , I am afraid , this limitation of the operatic singer to a very small range of parts . Wagner saw from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera calls for its own kind of singing and acting : Bayreuth came into being , indeed , primarily from the necessity of training singers whose style had become a bad mixture of all styles in the style specifically appropriate to his own music and dramatic ideals . And since our singers are severely restricted in their choice of parts by the range , the timbre , and the power of their voices , the only thing to do now seems to be to let them specialise to their hearts ' content , but also to insist on their securing for themselves , and passing on to their listeners , the full value of this specialisation . If the acting singer is going to play on only one instrument all his life , we have at least the right to demand that he shall play on it with thorough competence . A pianist who played Couperin in precisely the same style as Liszt would be regarded as hardly having thought out much more than the rudiments of his job . The case is not much better when the operatic actor plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most diverse kinds . Let me give a concrete example . A singer whom we all know and admire greatly has been endowed by nature with a great gift for pathetic expression through her voice alone , its peculiarly moving timbre , its delicate inflections . This natural formula , for such we may call it , fits almost magically such a  | part as that of the Marschallin in the Rosenkavalier ' , the part of a woman whose pathos resides in her consciousness of the gradual slipping away of her youth . But when exactly the same formula of vocal expression is applied to Sieglinde , then , however moving the singer 's accents may be in themselves , we feel that it is the operatic artist , rather than Sieglinde , to whom we are listening ? that the pathos of Sieglinde should have a different , a bigger , more saga-like quality about it . The pathos of Elsa is , or should be , of another kind again ? the pathos of a woman much younger and less consciously sorry for herself than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unawakened nature has never had to face the realities of life as Sieglinde has had to do . To sing , therefore , Elsa 's famous Mein armer Bruder ! ' with precisely the same timbre , the same accents , the same inflections , the same consequent psychological suggestions , as are employed for the Marschallin of the end of the first act of the Rosenkavalier ' or the Sieglinde of the second act of the Valkyrie ' , is , it seems to me , to achieve , with the best intentions , merely a sort of dramatic falsity . I may add that to import the same unvarying formula of expression into one German Lied after another is to carry the process of psychological misrepresentation still further . One way , then , in which operatic singers could improve their acting ? that is to say , the verisimilitude of their suggestion of the character of the moment ? would be to learn to play more subtly than they do now upon their voices , to modify their natural formulae to suit the requirements of each part or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proved by Chaliapine . Since much play of facial expression is difficult , if not impossible , when one is singing , the operatic actor should concentrate on expressive facial play and gesture when he is not singing . The finest acting I saw at Covent Garden this year was that of Mme Ohms* as Ortrud . Unfortunately , however , highly intelligent work of this kind is apt to go unnoticed by the main body of the audience , because of the tendency to keep one 's eyes on the singer of the moment , to Footnote  | the neglect of everyone else . The result , in the case I have just mentioned , was that while the Lohengrin or the Elsa of the evening was doing nothing at all out of the common in the first two acts ? merely singing , indeed , more or less well ? and the real drama as Wagner conceived it was being carried almost entirely on the shoulders of Mme Ohms , few people had eyes for her . We are , in fact , up against one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who happens to be singing at the moment has for the average spectator , to the neglect of something far more dramatically significant that may be going on elsewhere on the stage . The best way to ensure that our opera singers shall act would be , of course , to insist on their going through a proper training in acting in their young days , when the body is flexible and teachable . But if the most we can expect of the majority of them is that they shall make the best use possible of a few standardised gestures and attitudes and movements , at all events let us insist on their exploiting these intelligently . The Russian Ballet has shown us that with virtually no facial play at all , and with the minimum of gesture , it is possible to convey a good deal in the way of psychological suggestion . But in the miming ballet the vital gesture or movement is carefully worked out to begin with , the incidence of it is accurately timed , and owing to the dancer 's perfect control of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theoretically something of this kind might be arranged for our opera singers : as so many of them have to have the words and the music of their parts drilled into them almost by force of arms , there could be no objection to their being similarly drilled in , or dragooned into , the art of elementary movement . But whether the theory could be widely converted into practice is perhaps doubtful : most of our famous or notorious singers would be taking up this study too late in life ? you ca n't teach an old dog tricks ! ? and with bodies too set and too unwieldy for very much to be done with them . It would be interesting , however , some day to see an opera produced by singers whose bodies and minds had been properly taken in hand at the early age at which the ballet dancer begins to be trained for his career .  | LIEDER SINGING 14th February 1937 LAST week I raised the question whether there is such a thing as ' singing ' ? that is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , there is ; singing means producing from the human throat a succession of tones at definite pitches ; and good singing , so far as that definition is concerned , would simply mean producing tones that are beautiful in themselves and in perfect tune with each other and with the accompanying instrument . Considering the matter even from that rudimentary point of view it is a sad fact that we seldom hear really good singing : at the best , an opera or concert performance , taking the singers en masse , is rarely more than fifty per cent . or so of the real thing , while at anything less than the best we get something that suggests that when Poe wrote ( or might have written ) , . . . and their tongues can only speak In a tuneless jangling wrangling as they shriek , and shriek , and shriek , he must have had some experience as a music critic : throughout how many performances , for instance , have I , for one , felt , with the poet of The Bells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quiet of the tomb ! We hear extremely little good singing in the purely technical sense of the term ; mercifully for us , our ears are so blunted by constantly listening to the second-rate that it is seldom we realise how far from the first-rate even eighty per cent . of the best singing is . By singing ' , however , I do not mean , for my present purpose , simply voice production . Our concert and opera singers do not sing just for singing 's sake ? if they did , mere vowel sounds and  | notes in any order would do ; nor do we in the audience listen to a performance with our interest wholly centred in singing for singing 's sake . The singers have to reproduce for us , and make significant to us , what the composer had in his mind when he wrote his music ; and since what the composer had in his mind means something quite different in each case , it is obvious that singing ' in the full sense of the term means , or ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything depends on the nature of the music and of the words . To begin with , there is a type of music in which the words count for practically nothing , while the music , being little more than the exploitation of a formula ? the value of the music varying with the amount of genius the composer can turn upon the exploitation of the formula ? calls for nothing more than good tone , good intonation , and good line . Take , by way of illustration , things like the two tenor arias in Don Giovanni ' ? Dalla sua pace ' and I1 mio tesoro . ' The words are mere trash : most listeners have no idea what they mean , while for those who do know what they mean almost any other Italian words that would fit the melody would do equally well . The music , for its part , is concerned with nothing outside itself ; it consists simply of notes following each other in agreeable melodic patterns . An aria of this kind demands nothing but good singing ' in the simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this that it is easy to sing . Far from it , as our sad experience has taught us ! It calls for a first-rate voice and a first-rate vocal technique . In a thing of this sort the voice is used almost purely and simply as an instrument ; and it is because so few singers have the quality and the skill of the ordinarily good instrumentalist that so few of them can make even a passable showing in this kind of music . But even supposing an old-style Italian opera aria to be sung according to all the rules of the game , some listeners still find themselves unable to suppress the critical spirit . For the game itself is apt to reveal itself as too obviously a game . The singers of this kind of music all tend to do pretty much the same thing at the same points : the pattern has become established , and all they have to do is to reproduce it according to their individual  | powers . Hence it comes about that , apart from certain inevitable differences in vocal timbre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Duke 's opening aria in Rigoletto ' is hardly distinguishable from another 's . And because the style is constructed on a pattern , and the pattern is easily acquired by imitation , the tenors are inclined to do virtually the same thing in every set aria they have to sing ; there is the same spinning ' of the tone , the same standardised nuancing at the regulation points , the same manner of treating high notes , the same way of making an effect of climax , and so on . Further , because of this standardisation , an evening of that kind of singing leaves on the critical listener an impression of a certain intellectual limitation on the part of the singers . It is in the main vox et praeterea nihil ; he leaves the theatre with the feeling that he has been assisting at the operatic equivalent of a dish that was popular with the old Roman epicures ? nightingales ' tongues and peacocks ' brains . Once more I must take care to guard myself against misunderstanding . I do not despise this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , it can give exquisite pleasure of a particular kind , the same kind of pleasure that we get from a fine instrumental performance . And there are people who look for no other pleasure but this from singing . The result is that they are inclined to judge other kinds of singing by a wrong criterion . For there is another kind of music than the one that gave birth to this style and that finds its fullest realisation in it . There is a type of music that is shot through and through with poetic suggestion ; and in this type , as the vocal line is determined by other than quasi-instrumental considerations , obviously the style appropriate to it is not that of what we may call purely instrumental singing . Each great song inhabits a mental world of its own : it follows , therefore , that the singer , if he wishes to carry us with him , must reproduce that world for us . Standardised methods will not do here , nor does a fine voice suffice of itself . Some of the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by people with voices that are admirably musical in the abstract . For here the abstract simply will not do . Some voices are fundamentally unfitted by their very nature  | to express certain emotions or certain poetic ideas ? a rudimentary fact which the ordinary Lieder singer is curiously slow to recognise when she makes up her programme . It is perfectly useless for the soprano with a sweet crystalline voice to try to suggest spiritual shadow ; yet singers with voices of this kind will pass without a break , and without a suspicion of the absurdity of the proceeding , from the Brahms Cradle Song ' to the Sapphische Ode ' or Immer leiser wird mein Schlummer ' , or from Wolf 's delicate little Der Gartner ' to his Gebet ' or Muhvoll komm ' ich and beladen ' . Further , both the technique and the musical understanding of most of our Lieder singers are too limited , too patternised , for them to be able either to give a particular song the vocal colour it requires or to grasp its essential rhythm . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a song like Brahms 's Der Schmied ' calls for a peculiar incisiveness of rhythm ? the kind of thing that Elena Gerhardt and Nikisch in combination used to achieve to perfection ; yet the average singer and accompanist can do no more with the song than make its regular three-four sound like waltz-time . It is because most recitalists persist in attempting Lieder for which they have neither the appropriate vocal colour nor the right musical and poetic understanding that the critic so often finds himself compelled to say that all the songs sounded very much alike , as if they had all been written by the same composer , or at any rate had come from the same epoch and milieu . And the worst possible judges of Lieder singing ? or indeed , for that matter , of Lieder themselves ? are the people whose sole standard of singing is the quasi-instrumental , the people who are fundamentally insensitive to that suffusion of music by poetry that is the very essence of the Lied in its most highly developed form . I have repeatedly been astonished to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had seemed to me to be the last word in absurdity : they had been satisfied with the natural charm of the singer 's voice , and blind to the fact that this purely physical charm had no organic relation whatever to what the poet and the composer were talking about . Per contra , I have known people of this type to be quite insensitive to a performance that had seemed  | to me to get to the very heart of the poetic and musical matter ; they had missed in the performance the special virtues of what I have called singing in the abstract . The truth is that in musical practice there is no such thing as singing ' per se . There are merely different styles of singing , severally appropriate to different kinds of music and words ; and the critical standards applicable to one style are only to a very small degree applicable to the others . Operatic singing is yet another matter . I shall devote my article to this subject next week . OPERA SINGING 21st February 1937 IN my last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and Lieder singing : in the former the words count for nothing , the vital matter being beauty of tone , purity of intonation , and elegance of accent and phrasing : in Lieder singing the words , or rather what is at the back of the words , play a large part in determining the appropriate musical style . And not only does this style vary as between Lied and Lied , composer and composer , but the very timbre or weight of the voice has to be taken into consideration . A particular natural quality of voice that may be a great asset in the case of one song may be a hopeless liability in the case of another . The difficulties of the opera singer are even greater than those of the Lieder singer , for he has to be an actor as well . For the imperfect performances we generally get in opera houses the singer is not always primarily to blame . Our friends the dramatic critics are apt to become satirical when they discuss acting in opera . Their strictures , however , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' does not and can not mean the same thing in the spoken drama and in opera : the opera singer 's face , with the set of the mouth determined by the necessity for rounded tone production , can not be expected to have the same mobility as the face of the actor who has only words to utter .  | In the second place , the quick give-and-take , ebb-and-flow of spoken dialogue is impossible in music , which demands room in which to unfold itself . In the third place ? and this is the most vital point of all ? the opera singer can not pick and choose his parts as the ordinary actor can . No actor is cast for a part unless nature has already indicated him , physically and mentally , as a reasonable candidate for that part ; but the opera singer has often to play parts for which nature has given him only one real qualification ? the nature and the range of his voice . It is true that some half-dozen people can spend their lives trotting round the world singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But these are exceptions : the average tenor has to try his hand at all sorts of parts , in all sorts of opera , merely because he is a tenor . Is it to be wondered at that even if he can sing the music adequately ( which is rarely the case ) , he often strikes us as a sorry misfit in the part as a whole ? Nature may have given him a fine voice ; but she has carelessly neglected to provide him with either the necessary appearance or the necessary mentality for many of the parts he is called upon to play . And in opera the mentality is of considerable importance ; if a singer says to us , in effect , Tonight I am Tristan , or Walther , or Isolde , or Brynhilde ' , we have the right to expect from him or her not merely the notes set down in the score , but the mind of the character as Wagner conceived it . If he or she is obviously not that character , the best singing in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much that seems to him vital to the revelation of the composer 's mind . There has just reached me an interesting book by an American writer , Mr Pierre Key ( ' This Business of Singing ' ) , in which we have an interesting light on Caruso 's attitude towards this question of interpretation in opera . I keep my voices ' , he said to Mr Key , in a sort of drawer . When I am to sing Radames I take out of one drawer my Radames voice . It is heavy and dramatic in fibre . For Nemorino , in L'Elisir d'Amore ' , I turn to another drawer in that cabinet for a lighter quality of voice . And during the day when I have a performance I try  | to keep in the mood of the character I am to sing that evening , so that my voice as well as my thoughts will be in keeping with what I am to do on the stage . An artist does not sing Vasco di Gama 's music in L'Africana ' with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marta ' . He approaches a song that is not operatic with consideration of the style demanded ; and he suits his tones to fit . To adopt one weight and general colour of voice for every piece of music is to be mechanical , inartistic , and vocally limited . ' There are very few opera singers , however , who are such perfect singers as Caruso was ; and even Caruso 's precepts do not cover the whole ground . His triumphs were in Italian and French opera ; and it is no disparagement of these genres to say that in general they do not confront the singer with anything like the same psychological difficulties as the Wagner operas . We have had many excellent Des Grieux , and Manricos , and Rigoletto ' Dukes , and Fausts , and Romeos , and Rodolfos ; but who , in this generation , has seen a single Siegfried or Brynhilde that he could persuade himself was the whole character as Wagner conceived it ? A great operatic character , in fact , calls for so many qualities in the singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the thoughtful spectator leaves the theatre , at best , only half satisfied . We may get , as with Flagstad , good singing , and for that we are very grateful : but Flagstad 's Isolde or Brynhilde is not psychologically on the level of Wagner 's . On the other hand , when we do get an actor who can make us really live in a part , the chances are that he has not the voice for it . We had an illustration of this in the performance last year of Tristan ' by the Dresden opera company . The Tristan on that occasion , Julius Polzer , had no voice to speak of ; yet many of us thought him , on the whole , the best Tristan we have ever seen , especially in the third act . People who listen to opera simply for singing 's sake , on the other hand , could get no pleasure at all out of his performance . Argument about the matter is quite useless ; the difference of opinion about it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view . It is not that those of us who found Polzer 's performance so engrossing are insensitive to  | beautiful singing ; it is simply that an opera like Tristan ' is a complex affair , and no amount of good singing in the abstract will compensate us for a reading of the part of Tristan that never succeeds in placing before us the mind of the character as Wagner conceived it . The ideal thing , of course , would be an impersonation like Polzer 's plus perfect singing . But that is an impossibility , the operatic world being what it is . In actual experience we have to put up with one of two things ? reasonably good singing but no Tristan in the full sense of the word , or the real Tristan with dubious singing . What I found myself doing that evening , after I had got over my first feeling of disappointment with Polzer as a singer , was to close down my critical faculties in this one field and concentrate on the fine intellectual qualities of the performance ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that for once I had seen Wagner 's Tristan as he really is . All this does not mean that people of my way of thinking do not mind what kind of singing they get in opera so long as the actor knows the inner meaning of what he is saying and singing . It all depends on the circumstances of the moment : just as no amount of good singing could satisfy me if the central conception of the character were faulty , so no amount of good acting could satisfy me if the singing were really bad . Polzer 's singing was not bad in the sense that it was offensive to the physical ear : it was simply that it was not singing ' in the full sense of that term . I imagine that he is not a born singer , but a highly intelligent man who has made , by hard work , some sort of voice for himself in order that he may have some sort of a medium through which to realise his extremely subtle conception of a great work . Coleridge has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' not because we believe in ghosts , but because for the moment , for the purposes of the drama , we suspend our disbelief in ghosts . In much the same way I did not believe , when listening to Polzer 's Tristan , that this , in the abstract , was good singing , but I temporarily suspended my general disbelief in some at any rate of the disabilities attaching to imperfect singing . I could probably not have sat out a performance of Tristan in which I had been given merely Polzer 's voice without  | Polzer 's brains . But as it was , I found it easy , after the first ten minutes or so , to make all the necessary allowances ? to ignore the actual tones and concentrate on the fineness of the mentality at the back of this reading of Tristan . I still feel today that of all the Continental tenors I have heard in the part in recent years , Polzer is the only one who would draw me to a theatre in anything but a professional capacity . Opera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can not reasonably expect every factor in a performance to be anything like perfect . Listening to even the best opera performance is a matter of tolerating this or that in consideration of being given something else that is worth having for its own sake . But one thing is certain ? that good singing ' in the common acceptation of that term is not of itself enough in opera . The intelligent spectator , who knows the work he is listening to and has done a good deal of thinking of his own about it , is not to be fobbed off with mere singing ' if everything else that makes the opera what it was for the creator of it is lacking .  | CAN SCIENCE HELP ? 5th September 1937 SIR MILs0M REES seems to have created a sensation with his recent address before a learned gathering in which he said that the vocal cords were not put into the human throat for the purpose of singing . Some of us , it is true , had long suspected this , less on scientific grounds than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elsewhere . Who , for instance , who has listened to a typical Alberich doing what Mr Creevey describes old Talleyrand doing in some London drawing-room or other ? ' making the cursedest nasty noises in his throat ' ? could possibly bring himself to believe that he was watching the operation of a really natural physiological function ? Such journalistic comment as I saw on Sir Milsom Rees 's dictum was not very impressive : apparently the naive reaction of the plain man to that dictum was that the vocal cords must have been put there for singing , or how could people sing ? I fancy , however , that a consideration so simple as all that must have occurred to Sir Milsom long ago , and that consequently if it did not weigh with him there ca n't be much in it . His thesis , I fancy , is just this ? that the vocal cords can be made to do all that is demanded of them in singing , at any rate for a time , but that it goes against the grain with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later they rebel , with the result either that the voice goes ' or the singer has to keep his end up by a variety of fakes , some of them very clever , some of them not so clever ; moreover , that the throat specialist has the most conclusive visible evidence of the physical damage inflicted upon the throat by the persistent effort of many singers to make the cords do more than they were ever intended by nature to do . On the scientific side I think we may take Sir Milsom 's word for it . He is an eminent authority not only on the throat in general but on the singing throat in particular : in his forty  | years ' experience as laryngologist to Covent Garden he has examined the mechanism of practically every singer of distinction ; he has made a special study of the connection between singing and singers ' laryngeal troubles ; and I think we may take it for granted that he knows what he is talking about . However , I am not going to argue the scientific question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take me out of my depth . For another , there are some fifty thousand teachers of singing in this country alone , each of them , on his own admission , being the sole possessor of the secret of perfect voice production ' ; and I know , from painful experience , that if I begin to discuss singing , at least forty-nine thousand eight hundred and ninety-six of these gentlemen will write to me on the subject . So if any of them should feel inclined to write to me about it , let me assure them here and now that I agree with everything they may have to say before they say it . Few will deny , I suppose , that the standard of singing is lower now than it has been for something like two centuries . I am not referring to artistry in interpretation : that is another matter altogether , and one in which the present-day standard is remarkably high . I am dealing purely and simply with singing in the sense of the production of exceptionally beautiful tone : and in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of the great voices is about over . A voice so fine that it attracts world-wide attention simply as a musical instrument is so rare a product that in any one decade nature seems incapable of throwing out more than about six or eight out of all earth 's millions . Various readers may feel inclined to alter or add to the following lists according to their personal fancy : but , broadly speaking , each of them , I think , sums up its epoch fairly . Born between 184o and 185o were Patti , Maurel , Maas , Matcrna , the two Vogls , Lilli Lehmann , Pauline Lucca , and Christine Nilsson . In the next decade come Albani , Nordica , Litvinne , the two de Reszkes , Plancon , Tamagno , and Battistini . These were exceptional vintage years . After that , it seems to me , the ground tends to become less fruitful in respect either of quantity or of quality or of both . Between 186o and 1870 were born Melba , Ternina , Gulbranson , Eames , and Nevada : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | ? Caruso , Ackte , Destinn , Chaliapin , Van Rooy , Kirkby Lunn , and Clara Butt : between 188o and 18go , Elena Gerhardt , Julia Culp , and Frieda Hempel . The singers born between 1890 and 1900 comprise virtually all those who are now active among us ; and I ask the reader to decide for himself how many , if any , of these deserve to rank with the great names of the past . Let me once more remind him that the question before us is not of singers who command our respect for their qualities of musicianship , culture , and general intelligence , but purely and simply of voices , of the kind that arouse universal enthusiasm on their own account , whether or no ? occasionally no ? they happen to be reinforced by the other qualities I have mentioned . It would almost seem as if nature concentrated cyclically on the production of fine voices : the years 1841-1845 ( Patti , Nilsson , Lucca ) , 1850-55 ( Jean and Edouard de Reszke , Plancon , Tamagno , Albani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulbranson , Ternina ) , 1870-1873 ( Van Rooy , Caruso , Chaliapin , Lunn , Butt , the last four all being born in 1873 ) represent a special effort on her part . Why there should be these cycles of boom and slump I leave it to scientists , philosophers and mystics to determine if they can . It may , for all I know , have something to do with sun-spots , or perhaps the Message of the Great Pyramid . Whether anything can be done scientifically in the matter would be an interesting subject for research and experiment . An easy solution of the problem would perhaps be to go back to seventeenth and eighteenth century methods of making male sopranos and contraltos . Our ancestors ' testimony as to the superlative beauty and power and flexibility of these artificially manufactured voices can be accepted unhesitatingly : they were so greatly superior in every way to the ordinary tenor that this latter order of voice was held in poor esteem . However , it is improbable that we shall ever revert to the methods of our forefathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to produce the kind of voice it wants , and in the numbers it would like , by intelligent breeding ? The question is not a new one ; confident answers have even been given to it .

I am indebted for my information about this daring spirit Robert to Champfleury , who , in some notes in his Souvenirs et Portraits de Jeunesse ' ( 1872 ) , tells us also of another reformer , M.

Moulin is kind enough to give us the recipe for making one 's child a musician ' .

' Still , the first steps in a new science are notoriously the most difficult ; and until M. Moulin 's system , or that of M.

I am therefore compelled to attempt it myself . Before we begin to dogmatise about the present condition of singing , would it not be as well to make sure what we mean by the term ? Is there such a thing as singing ' per se ? The musical vocabulary in general is painfully inadequate to express distinctions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , or perhaps we ourselves , employ the same standardised term to describe quite different things . We speak of counterpoint , for instance , as if it meant quite definitely just one thing ; whereas the truth is that Palestrina counterpoint and Bach counterpoint are two very different things , not merely in their procedure but in the habit of mind , the musical orientation , in which they respectively have their origin . Because of the poverty of our nomenclature , we apply the same term , symphony ' to an early Haydn work , the Eroica , and the Sibelius No. 7 , though the ultimate purpose , the inner world of which the music is the mirror , and the technical means adopted to make this particular piece of music the mirror of that particular world , are as different from each other as chalk from cheese . And , to extend the illustration , is it not clear that the old term singing ' is inapplicable en masse to the various artistic activities we subsume under that term today ? If any branch of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencerian formula of evolution as a constant widening out from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous , from the undifferentiated to the differentiated , it would be music .

As one writer of that epoch put it , music ' for a long time had meant just one thing : composers used , for instance , precisely the same idiom and the same technique for sacred music and for secular , for the madrigal as for the mass ; whereas in his more enlightened epoch , as the writer proudly points out , they had no less than three orders of music corresponding to three different ways of feeling about things ? one style for church music , one for chamber music , and one for opera . If Berardi could return to earth today he would perhaps be astonished at the extent to which this differentiation has proceeded in a further century and a half . New species have sprung up of which he never dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more remarkable for their differences than for their resemblances . Opera ' , for instance , can now mean things so unlike each other as Don Giovanni ' , Aida ' , Tristan ' , and Pelleas and Melisande ' . We have only the one word , song ' , for things so unlike each other as the Licder of Schubert , Brahms , Wolf , Mahler , and Faure . And so long as we continue to use the same old term for fundamentally different things , so long will we continue to make the mistake of judging this sub-species or that by the laws that determine the being of another , to the vast confusion of our critical standards , such as they are . Now singing meant for a long time , and until quite recently , something quite other than what it means today . Singing has become differentiated into species and sub-species , and only aesthetic muddle can result from applying the old generic term to all of these . The singing of the older type was a particular product spontaneously evolved to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a very long time , was virtually undifferentiated : it called for not only a standard ideal of tone and management of tone , but a standard style of expression . The physical and mental apparatus suitable to one opera or oratorio aria was applicable with the minimum of change to any other . This homogeneity of purpose and of the means by which that purpose could best be realised , has given way , under the stress of evolution , to a baffling heterogeneity . Subtleties of psychology have come into play of which the  | older composers and singers had no conception . Any tenor ( or male soprano ) who could sing one Handel operatic aria could sing another : any soprano who could sing Pamina 's Ach , ich fithl 's ' could sing Susanna 's Deh ! vieni , non tardar ' , although the one aria is an expression of grief and the other an expression of the amorous . But today the tenor who is ideal for Celeste Aida ' is far from ideal for Tristan or Pelleas , and vice versa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is in one Wolf song can not bring out a fraction of what there is in another of a completely different mental cast . A new conception of what singing would have to mean was forced upon the world by Wagner for the simple reason that it was forced on himself by the very nature of his creations . He did not want his operas to be declaimed or barked . He wanted them to be sung ; but the kind of singing he wanted hardly existed in his early and middle days . What he said , in effect , was this : Italian voice production and Italian methods of expression are admirable things in and by themselves . But they came by a natural process out of a certain kind of music and a certain kind of mentality ; and therefore they are inapplicable to music like mine , which starts from a different point from the Italian and moves towards a different goal . My music is German music : my mind is a German mind : I must therefore have voices and style suitable to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want German teachers to produce first-rate voices , but not to make the old mistake of modelling them on the Italian . For one thing , our German throats are not built like the Italian , and therefore can not vocalise in the same way ; I for another , a highly consonantal language like the German can not possibly be intoned in the same way as a mainly vowel language like the Italian ; for another , the suggestions of Italian opera mentality that are inseparable from singing of the older international opera type are quite alien to purely German characters and German emotions . Every argument that can be put forward to prove the perfection of the Italian opera voice and style is an argument against the employment of them in operas that neither musically , linguistically , mentally , or racially have any congruence  | whatever with Italian opera . In every past epoch a particular style of composition has been organically allied with a particular style of performance . The action and interaction between the two have been perfect : composers have written for certain instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , while conversely the very existence and easy applicability of these instruments has controlled the thinking of the composers . Well and good . But here is a new kind of art , that can be realised adequately only on a new kind of instrument . Since that instrument does not exist , we must make it . ' So far Wagner . But the line of evolution from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous has not stopped with him . The types of music , and the types of mind behind the music , have become more and more differentiated since his day ; and we have only to develop his own principle still further to see that vocal instruments of more and more differentiated types are being called for almost each decade . In spite of the differences between the contemporary Bach and Handel , or between the contemporary Haydn and Mozart , it still remains true that their resemblances over-ride their differences , and that certain broad principles of performance are applicable to the music of each member of each pair . But in the present day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the human instruments or the methods of procedure that suit one to perfection hardly suit another at all . The musical world pretty well agrees by now that a conductor who is admirable in one composer 's music may be a failure in another 's . Those of us who spend most of our time in concert rooms and opera houses know , to our cost , that singers are constantly attempting tasks for which they are not suited . The average recital programme , for instance , is beyond the capacity of any singer . The wise recitalist is he who knows his limitations and chooses songs that all lie well within them . The less wise recitalist , who attempts in the same evening a Bach aria , a Verdi or Ponchielli scena , a Purcell song , a succession of Schubert , Schumann , Brahms and Wolf Lieder that call for an infinity of vocal timbres , of styles , and of intellectual and emotional understanding , merely courts disaster .  | The tendency , as I see it , is all towards further specialisation in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baritone , the secret of whose appeal is a moving natural elegiac quality in the voice , and an intense sympathy with certain defeatist human moods , to try to sing heroic parts ; and vice versa . Our singers will have to go the way of our actors , especially of our film actors . The days when an actor could impose himself upon his audience tonight as Romeo , tomorrow as Figaro , the following night as Tartuffe , and so on , are gone , probably for ever . What happens now , broadly speaking , is that an actor is cast for the particular type of part which his features , his stature , his voice , his manner , his mannerisms , and so on especially qualify him , and for no other type to the end of his days . So it will more and more tend to become with the singer . Already we see , in Wagner opera , a few singers specialising in certain parts to the exclusion of all others . That process will soon have to be extended to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the simple reason that no singer on earth has all the varieties of vocal timbre , of style , of mental perception , required to cover every type of Wolf song . What we will get is Wolf singers of the passionate type , Wolf singers of the elegiac type , Wolf singers of the ironic type , and so on . Singing ' of the older abstract type , in which all that was required was a fine voice and good taste in the traditional style , is virtually dead and done with , except in connection with the music that was explicitly written with a view to the exploitation of those qualities . A beautiful voice is no longer a passport to any and every kind of music ; on the contrary , there may be something in the peculiar nature of the very beauty of the voice that completely unfits it for interpreting certain characters or moods . Some time ago I heard a baritone of considerable accomplishment within his own sphere singing Sachs 's two songs from the Meistersinger ' . They could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer was a man of culture . Yet the total effect of it all was no more like Sachs than a sycamore is like an oak . Partly because of something in the very timbre of the voice , partly because of the many suggestions of a personal mentality and a cultural environment that had nothing in common with Wagner , everything that Wagner had  | in his mind when he wrote the words and the music was missed . Our audiences , in the main , are as yet not very sensitive to discrepancies and anomalies of this kind in singing . But they will become increasingly conscious of them ; and the time is bound to come when singers will see the wisdom of not attempting to cover more of the vast field of music than their natural limitations lay open to them .  | 15th April 1945 I RECEIVED the other day a letter that almost broke my too tender heart . It was from the possessor of a genuine bass voice well known to radio listeners . He complained of the shabby treatment that voices of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he asks , did the great Lieder writers set such an overwhelming majority of their songs for the high voice ? ' A statistical examination of their works has led him to the following conclusions : Schubert : speaking from memory , all the cycles and 70 or 8o per cent of his other songs are in high keys . Schumann : Pretty much the same . Brahms : in three albums ( Peters edition ) containing 164 songs , only 32 originally written in low keys . Wolf : a typical example ? 39 songs in the first three Morike volumes with only three in low keys . I think we shall find a similar proportion in other Lieder writers . Of course I know there are outstanding exceptions , like the Brahms Ernste Gesange , the Wolf Harfenspieler , etc. , but they are few and far between . In fact , I should say that the genuine bass songs in the whole German repertory would not provide more than two or three recitals . I can find no satisfactory reason for this prevailing prejudice against singers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these composers thought in keys and left the voice to take care of itself ; but surely in that case , according to the law of averages , the result should be about fifty-fifty ? The preference for high keys is too persistent and universal to be the outcome of mere chance . ' Here is a grave problem indeed . Perhaps my correspondent 's figures are not wholly accurate : in the first 39 of the Morike songs , for instance , I find not three but five songs in the bass compass ; and of course there are several out-and-out bass songs , in particular the three Michelangelo Lieder , in Wolf 's later works . Then again there are many songs written in the treble clef that might lead the casual observer to think they  | were intended for a tenor , whereas they lie well within the bass compass ? Schubert 's Prometheus ' , for instance , which ranges between the high E natural and the low B natural . Still , my correspondent seems to be right in his general contention . A swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that many a fine song , bass in mentality , is barred to the true bass merely because of one or two high notes in climaxes . This phenomenon is interesting because we have on record a notable case of what was really intended for an operatic bass role having become the property , for the most part , of the bass-baritones , because of a few upper notes that are beyond the true bass compass . The case is that of Wotan , and it is particularly interesting just now because in the present dearth of first-rate deep voices the role is being undertaken in at least one foreign opera house not even by a bass-baritone but by a baritone . But we have Wagner 's express statement , in one of his letters , that for his Wotan he had had in mind a pure bass , and that to obtain this ideal he would have no objection to the occasional high notes being replaced by lower ones . There seems to be something , then , in my correspondent 's suggestion that composers are inclined just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of itself ' . I myself would put it in a slightly different way : it is probable that in many cases they have had in mind a sort of generalised high voice ' or low voice ' , but either because they have only the vaguest idea of vocal technique or because , lost in the fine frenzy of inspiration , they have lost touch with practicalities , they have been unaware that at one point and another they have shifted over from one voice-type to another . Debussy 's Pelleas is ostensibly a tenor , but in practice the part is not ideal for any type of voice ; Debussy , when writing the music , was thinking in terms of his own voice , which was of no recognised species . Brahms , again , describes his Four Serious Songs as for ' bass voice ' ; and certainly if any songs are pure bass in their mentality it is these . Yet a pure bass is not comfortable with the occasional high F 's and F sharps and with the climactic G of the last song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ' the notes as of keeping phrase and colour and atmosphere intact in so high a  | tessitura . Consequently we find a deep bass like Kipnis transposing the second song down half a tone and the other three down a full tone in the records made for the H.M.V. Brahms Society ; and rightly so , for the gravity of the pure bass timbre in the songs as a whole is far more important than the precise pitch of three or four exceptional high notes . We will continue with the subject next week , when I shall have something to say which , I hope , will bring solace to the wounded heart of my bass correspondent .  | 22nd April 1945 I GAVE last week one or two reasons for not agreeing that the composers in general have been as prejudiced ' against the bass as my correspondent tried to make out . Perhaps another answer to the question Why do they write a larger proportion of their Lieder for high voice ? ' would be that composers for the most part take only a narrow conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine that the thing most suitable for singing about is love , successful , disastrous , or merely speculative ; and for that trite theme the tenor , for some occult reason or other , is generally regarded as nature 's own medium . But when the composers get on to loftier subjects , such as haute politique , conspiracy , wine-bibbing , the damnation of souls , or murder of the finer kind , then far more often than not it is to the low voice that they instinctively turn . The plain proof of this is afforded by their practice in opera and oratorio . Here the composer is not only free to cater for the low as well as the high voices but he must do so ; and we have only to run an eye over the repertory to see that for his more intelligent characters he prefers the lower voice to the higher . ( I rule out Wagner , who , being in the habit of doing not only his musical but his dramatic thinking for himself , endowed , perhaps over-optimistically , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad proposition I shall lump basses and bass-baritones and baritones together . The hero ' parts are mostly stereotyped : the hero ' of most stories is , by convention , in love with some chit or other , and so the composer blindly follows convention a step further and makes him a tenor . Brains are not , strictly speaking , a necessary part of his equipment ; Radames , for instance , owed his appointment as Commander in Chief of the Egyptian land forces not to any military genius but simply and solely to the fact that he was the only man in Egypt with a B flat in alt . Certain tenor parts of course , have been quite rightly cast for that type of voice  | roles in which inexperienced beardless youth and a certain mental innocence are of the essence of the character ; we could hardly imagine a bass Tamino , Des Grieux , Pelleas , Romeo or Ottavio But nearly all the roles that imply the possession of an intelligence and a character , good or bad but anyhow a bit out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Further , most of the companionable people , the likeable rascals , the jolly topers , the artful dodgers , are basses or baritones . Just look at a few of the names on the honourable list : Sarastro , Mephistopheles , Pizarro , Don Giovanni , Figaro , Cornelius 's Barber , Wotan , Hagen , Iago , Scarpia , Boris , Prince Igor , Khan Kontchak , Ivan the Terrible , the Muleteer in L'Heure Espagnole ' , Tchaikovsky 's Mazeppa , Mozart 's Don Alfonso , Baron Ochs , Falstaff , Don Pasquale , Osmin , Eugen Onegin , Varlaam , Gianni Schicchi , Amfortas , Handel 's Polyphemus , Gounod 's Vulcan , Sullivan 's Friar Tuck ; and so ad infinitum . The tenors are fobbed off with the ranting parts , the puling parts , the self-pitying parts , the easy amorous parts , the intellectually naive parts : the basses and baritones get the best thinking parts , the best drinking parts , the scheming and the doing parts : they get the kings and the statesmen and the high priests and the fiends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put it squarely to any man of ordinary intelligence ? would you choose Faust and Romeo and Cavaradossi and Dmitri and Ottavio and Fenton and Rinuccio and Samson for an evening 's company ( or , for that matter , Melisande and Marguerite and Gilda and Juliet and Michaela ) ; when you could talk and clink glasses with men and women of the world like Mephistopheles and Scarpia and Boris and Don Giovanni and Falstaff and Gianni Schicci and Maddalena and Carmen and Delilah ? No ; it is evident enough that these low-voice characters are the ones the composer has loved most , for he has generally given them his most original music . So the low-voice singers can take heart ; if the Lieder writers , slaves to convention , have too often fallen sobbing at the feet of the tenors and sopranos , the opera composers , men with a broader outlook on life , have proved conclusively that they prefer the basses , baritones and contraltos.  | 10th June 1948 IT is no part of my purpose , even if it were within my competence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . Production , like all other highly specialised activities , should be left to the specialist , for whom alone , in matters of art , I have any respect . Where , however , as in musical drama , the field of operation is a composite of territories subject to different artistic jurisdictions , the critical spectators may legitimately suggest that a procedure that may be fully valid in one of these may be invalid , or even fatal , in another . It is more especially the non-musical producer of opera who needs an occasional friendly reminder from musicians of this fundamental fact . My main contention is that since music is the most potent of all the factors in musical drama , the producer who can not mentally re-live an opera in terms of music , but works upon the libretto just as he would upon the text of a spoken play , can not possibly convey to the spectator , because he himself can not possibly realise it , what the work is really about ' . A little while ago I was told of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time and had been shocked by the immobility of Tristan and Isolde during their long colloquy in the second act . Surely , he said , they could be given something to . do ' to keep the thing moving ' . That young man should watch his step ; if he is n't careful he may grow up to be one of those producers who can conceive opera only in terms of the ordinary stage . The drama of Tristan ' is for the most part static . Hardly anything happens ' ; the drama is inside the two chief characters , the outcome of what they are and previously were in themselves , not of their reaction to this or that external event of the moment . The spectator , the singer , the conductor or the producer who is not aware of this basic fact , but shares the current fatuous notion that the long scene in the second act is just a love duet ' , has simply never got within a hundred miles  | of the most elementary understanding of what Tristan and Isolde ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; and to break in upon their physical quiescence with any of the transparent little stage dodges by which an appearance of movement ' is given to a long scene in spoken drama is the last word in absurdity . All through the second act , except near the end of it , when Wagner wants a dramatic climax , he obtains it by purely musical means which are beyond the understanding of the producer who is not himself acutely musical . A case in point is the moment when Isolde , resolved to bring Tristan to her , decides to extinguish the torch ? the symbol of hateful Day : at the words The Queen of Love 's will it is that Night shall come upon us and alone give us inner light ' he conveys the sense of climax by a sudden great enlargement of the melodic line in voice and orchestra . The device is simplicity itself , but it is tremendous in its effect ; the least instructed listener in the theatre feels instinctively that here the emotional tension has attained its maximum and must somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly a musical one ; the non-musical producer will never discover it by himself . Tristan ' is of course an exceptional case ; but the general principle holds good for all serious opera . Music brings into the drama a super-potent element , that of an idealisation beyond the scope of words ; and nothing should confront us on the stage that blurs this idealisation with touches of too crude reality . The music , needless to say , is not the entire drama ; but there should be nothing in the visible action that is not in the key ' of the music . It is because this rudimentary fact was overlooked by someone or other that the inn scene of Boris Godounov ' will always remain in the memory of some of us as the most mistaken thing of its kind in all our operatic experience . Opera , in fact , is musical drama , while spoken drama is just drama . Neither stage movement , however smartly true to life in the ordinary theatrical sense , nor scenic setting , however pretty as a picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the producer is not musical enough to be sensitive to the mental key ' of the music as a whole and from  | moment to moment . For an instance of the ideal correspondence of the key , the feel ' of the stage picture with that of the music , I would select the late Hugo Rumbold 's exquisite design for L'Heure Espagnole ' in one of the Covent Garden seasons of long ago . Even the degree and the very timbre of the lighting should play its subtle part in the total spiritual impression : I have yet to see in London a perfect correspondence between the light that floods the final scene of Fidelio ' and the mighty C major of the music .  | 15th July 1951 I HAVE heard dramatic critics speak disrespectfully of the kind of acting they see when they pay a visit to the opera . But acting ' has not the same meaning in opera as in spoken drama , the conditions of character-portrayal being entirely different in the two genres . Neither the starting-point nor the goal is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar and hampering conditions . His primary preoccupation is bound to be with the technical business of singing well ; and whereas speaking is a natural , everyday human function , singing is a more or less artificial one , involving certain inhibitions of the ordinary free play of the facial muscles . A good actor of the part of Tamino , rapturously contemplating the portrait of Pamina and musing How wondrous beautiful this face ' ( a rough English equivalent of Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd schon ' ) , could grace the words with a dozen artful little inflections of tone and colour and rhythm , and illuminate them by a dozen little tricks of facial expression . But the singer of the words has to follow humbly a line traced out for him in every detail by the composer ; on the second syllable , for instance , he has no choice but to immobilise his mouth for a time that would seem to the ordinary actor an eternity , since the note that Mozart has prescribed for this syllable is three times the length of each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter from another angle , it becomes evident that the positions imposed upon a singer 's mouth by the production of a given musical sound may make it impossible for him to reinforce by facial expression the bite ' of a word or a phrase . The reader can easily test this for himself . He will find it easy enough to elongate his mouth laterally to convey a particular nuance of the disagreeable if the words he is singing exploit the longitudinal e ' ( ' screech ' , sneer ' , beast ' , etc. ) ,  | but difficult or impossible if the librettist , having no experience or knowledge of singing , has expressed the mental state in question in words in which the rounded o ' predominates . The singer of such a line will find himself on the horns of a dilemma : the expression of the disagreeable image calls for a stretching of the lips , the shaping of the musical tone for a pursing of them . Chaliapine , it is true , could put his mouth into almost any position required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreeable singing tone ; but Chaliapines are rare . Furthermore , as I have more than once pointed out , casting in opera goes more by larynxes than by physical build or presence . On the speaking stage a flyweight Agamemnon or a bantam Otello would be as unnecessary as ridiculous ; but on the operatic stage the mere fact of the voice being tenor or bass , soprano or contralto , coloratura or noncoloratura , will determine the casting . Hence it comes about that we get Siegfrieds whose lack of inches has to be made up for by several all-too-visible thicknesses of boot-sole , and a Gilda , a Mimi , a Musetta , a Fidelio or a Salome of heaven knows how many tons displacement but who happens to have the right vocal range and volume for the music . To expect much acting ' of the ordinary kind under conditions such as these is asking rather too much of poor humanity . But there is another side to the matter , to which I will invite the reader 's attention next week . 22nd July 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a little hard on the acting of opera singers , and I pointed out one or two ways in which these worthy people are hampered by the very nature of the apparatus with which they have to work , particularly the fact that because they have to sing , not speak , they lack the opportunities for variety of facial expression enjoyed by the actor in a spoken play.This , however , is by no means the only handicap with which the opera singer has to contend .  | The dramatic critic is revolted or amused , according to the bias of his temperament and the extent of his charity , at the spectacle of an alleged Tristan or Don Ottavio or Radames confronting us with mouth wide agape for a whole minute or two stock-still except for an occasional stereotyped motion of the arms . ( When an opera character raises one arm we are to understand that something or other has moved him deeply ; when he raises both arms that means that his soul has been shaken to its foundations . ) But all this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years ago created this curious cosmos . He foresaw most of the things that would happen on earth and duly provided not only for them but also for the counterforces necessary to ensure the eternal running of the machine ; having arranged , for example , for an advance in science that will enable A to blow B into a thousand pieces , he squares matters by giving B the idea for an explosive that will enable him to blow A into two thousand ; and so ad infinitum . But one thing , apparently , the Demiurge failed to foresee ? the invention of opera , or at any rate the fact that in this multiple form of art the singer would have to rely for most of his dramatic expression on arm movements , and a mere pair of arms is a niggardly equipment for such a job . Whenever I turn over the pages of a book on Indian or some other oriental art and see some god or hero in swaggering possession of four or six arms I can not help regretting that opera singers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many permutations and combinations even four arms would be capable ! They would make all kinds of psychological subtleties and contrarieties possible ? as it were a counterpoint of gesture . Everyone knows the story of Gluck 's correction of the hasty critic who objected that it was absurd to make Orestes sing Now calm possesses my heart again ' to an agitated orchestral accompaniment . Orestes is lying ' , said Gluck in effect : he has been the murderer of his mother , and the orchestra is contradicting him . ' Now if the first player of the part of Orestes had had an extra pair of arms there might have been no misunderstanding on the critic 's part and no need for  | explanation on Gluck 's : the cross-currents in the hero 's soul would have been made perfectly clear by cross-rhythms of the arms . With such an equipment , again , Otello , by a convulsive movement of the north-east arm , might convey to us that he was revengefully bent on murdering Desdemona , while by a counterpoint in a contrary rhythm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a soft spot in his heart for the poor girl and very much regretted having to be so tough with her . Or take the case of Zerlina in doubt whether to yield or not to Don Giovanni 's smooth suggestion that he shall be allowed to entertain her at his villa and show her his stamp collection . Vorrei e non vorrei ' , she stammers , mi trema un poco it cor ... mi fa pieta Masetto ; presto non son pia forte ' ; I want to go and I do n't ; my heart 's all of a flutter . Yet surely I might let myself kick over the traces for once . Of course I 'm sorry for Masetto ; but all the same I do n't think I can hold out much longer . ' ( I translate freely , following the line of the little minx 's thought rather than the actual verbal shorthand Da Ponte has put into her mouth . ) Imagine the complex of emotions that could be conveyed here by four arms ! And then , when the ramparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm , partly through treachery within the gates , and she and Giovanni unite in a cry of Come on , come on , my hawk , my pigeon ; let us make up for lost time ' ? again I translate psychologically rather than verbally ? what shifting nuances of the eternal subject and countersubject of the Ewig-weibliche and the Ewig-nannliche could be expressed by a sort of eight-part Bachian counterpoint of arms ! But alas , opera singers , like the rest of us , are restricted to two . It will not have escaped the reader 's observation that the best operatic acting is generally given us by the minor characters , and particularly the comic ones ; we have all seen some very good Leporellos and Mimes and Papagenos and Beckmessers , but hardly ever a really credible Tristan or Don Ottavio or Siegfried or Tamino . Into this matter I will go more closely next week , and at the same time try to show that even on the serious side opera has some cards up its sleeve that are denied to the actor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer who should ask me what he can do to improve his acting I would reply with a counter-question ? Is your acting ' , as you call it by false analogy with the spoken drama , really necessary ? For the factor that chiefly differentiates opera from ordinary drama ? the music , and especially the orchestra ? can make acting ' supererogatory , for there the singer has a partner that as often as not takes the whole burden off his shoulders . I could cite numberless instances to illustrate this , but here I must confine myself to one in which the ordinary opera-goer will be able to follow me without any difficulty . In the first scene of the third act of the Meistersinger ' the young poet-knight is prevailed upon by Sachs to tell him his dream of the morning hours of the night before . This he does in what is commonly , though erroneously , spoken of as the Prize Song . The poem and the music , it is true , develop into the Prize Song in the final scene ; but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking advantage of the licence of their language to create portmanteau words , succinctly call the Morgentraumdeutweise ' ? as we would say , the strain ( words and music ) that interprets the inner meaning of the morning dream ' . Now there is no need for the player of the part to do anything at all in the way of acting here , for everything that the best actor could do is done infinitely better by the orchestra . All the singer need do is in the first place to sing as he should ( about this I shall have something to say later ) , and in the second place to follow the composer 's plain directions how to suggest the attempt to recall the blissful morning dream . He is to compose himself ' , and then begin his song very softly , as if communing with himself . ' That is all ; everything else that is to establish the dream atmosphere is done in the orchestra . The reader will remember that after Walther has decided to comply with Sachs 's request there come four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a softly-breathed chord  | in the lower strings , through which a harp arpeggio slowly ascends ? as it were the dispersion of the morning mental mist . Then comes a quick crescendo ; the chord is held for a while at its maximum , then slowly subsides into a long-drawn pianissimo . This volume-pattern , as we may call it , of the first two bars is repeated in the remaining two . For the full understanding of the procedure we have to go to the orchestral score , for the piano scores , so far as my knowledge of these extends , obscure or pervert the important basic facts . The soft chord with which the tiny prelude ends is , like its predecessor at half-way , to be held for a long time ' before it dies away ; and so much importance did Wagner attach to the sehr lange ' he has written over the stave that he added a further most explicit direction at the foot of the orchestral score : the two fermate must be of exceptionally long duration , and the ebb of tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' This four-bar prelude , then , paints to perfection the effort of the young poet to compose himself by self-communion ' , to recapture the dream state and objectivate it for Sachs ( and us ) in words and tones . And when the singer begins , Wagner accompanies him only with the muted strings at their softest and most veiled ; it is as if the dream were only slowly bridging the gulf in the young man 's mind between the subconscious and the conscious . I lack the space to describe in detail the gradual intensifications of orchestral colour as the long episode develops , the atmosphere changes , and the knight slowly passes from the hesitant effort to recapture the other-world dream to full this-world possession of it and realisation of its significance . Wagner has thus provided in his scoring of the scene all that is required to make it psychologically clear to us . The singer has virtually no need whatever to act ' ; all he has to do is to sing in tone-colours and tone-volumes that shall be consubstantial with those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , as a rule , can not do , for the simple reason that he can not sing in the full sense of the term . Ile begins conscientiously enough with an attempt at the piano , dolce ' prescribed for the orchestra ; but no sooner ( after half a dozen bars or so ) does the melody soar to the upper  | range of his voice than he bursts into a blaring fortissimo ; for owing to the defects in his technique he finds it difficult to produce any other kind of tone at a high pitch . He ruins the episode for the intelligent listener , takes all the psychology , all the poetry out of it , not because he ca n't act but because , to put it bluntly , he ca n't sing . And in countless other cases in his repertory he sins against the light in the same crude way . It is not to a school for acting that he needs to go but a school for singing . But this raises a new question : where in the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously in need of ?

There are only four ways of running words and music in harness together . ( 1 ) The words can be sung , they and the music combining to make an organic whole . This means , in practice , that musical expression and musical form become the governing factors . When the desire arises , as it has done periodically in musical history , to allow words a much wider range , three modes of doing so present themselves : ( 2 ) simple recitation of a long poem to illustrative music ; ( 3 ) a factitious compromise between speech and song , as in Schonberg ; ( 4 ) speech pure and simple in conjunction with music , as ( in its simplest form ) in the dungeon scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises more problems than it solves . For one thing , it is a pure impossibility to listen simultaneously to music-in-its-own-right and poetryin-its-own-right : in practice the music generally asserts its own despotic claim , the poetry becoming merely devitalised prose . To these theoretical difficulties others are added in performance . The speaking part is given as a rule to an actor , because of his training in rhetorical devices ; and I have yet to meet with an actor who can speak poetry as people with a true poetic sense read it to themselves . Naturally , also , the speaker exaggerates his own importance in the joint undertaking . He acts , and over-acts , the words ; and , not being a musician himself , and feeling that whatever else may be going on around him he must at all costs be heard and admired ; he orates so loudly as to obscure much of the texture of the music . The result is  | that after one disagreeable experience of this sort no one feels an irresistible urge to ask for another ; and so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumann 's Manfred ' , which contains much of his very finest music . With No. 3 the musical world stubbornly refuses to have any truck . If the reciter in Pierrot Lunaire ' , for example , is an actress ( not a singer ) , her points of contact with the musical element incarnated in the score are few and dubious . If she is a singer , her attempts to speak ( not sing ) at just-off the definite pitches indicated by the pseudo-melodic notes of the score become at times downright tragi-comic . The impulse to sing is so fundamental in her that while conscientiously trying to sheer away from the definite pitch she involuntarily keeps slipping on to it : then , realising suddenly that this is n't playing the game according to the rules laid down by the composer , she hastily slithers off it again . And , worst of all , our attempt to follow and enjoy the instrumental score in all its ingeniosities is frustrated by the annoyance set up in us by these unrelated vocal sounds that are always throwing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have often pleaded for a performance of Pierrot Lunaire ' in which the words shall be simply read out before each section ? so as to let the hearer have an idea of what it is all about ? the instrumental part being allowed to stand by itself and speak for itself . Will not the B.B.C. give us just one experimental performance of this sort ? There remains , then , our No. 4 , plain conversational speaking now and then while the music carries on freely in its own way . It is the oddest of paradoxes that this combination of the two stark opposites , music and speech , can be not only inoffensive in itself but made a telling dramatic infix in a texture otherwise given up wholly to music . A case in point is the colloquy in ordinary speech between Hoffmann , Niklaus , Schlemil and Dapertutto towards the end of the second act of The Tales of Hoffmann ' , while the orchestra sings softly and ironically the emotion-charged barcarolle . The dramatic tension is not dissipated , as we might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domain of music , but positively and astonishingly enhanced by it .  | Another case is Tosca 's comment over the corpse of Scarpia ? ' And before this man all Rome trembled ! ' Puccini has designedly written the notes as a sombre monotone on the low C sharp of the soprano voice , the effect being practically that of simple speech . We are surely entitled to ask , then , whether more systematic use can not be made of this method of a dramatic grafting of speech per se upon the musical tissue of an opera . It will mean , of course , a new technique of libretto writing , but that would come with practice . Anyhow the experiment is worth trying : a new libretto technique is obviously one of the things opera is most in need of today .  | HOLST calls his new work , that was produced at the Leeds Festival on Wednesday , a First Choral Symphony ' , from which one gathers that he has sufficient faith in the vitality of the form to contemplate further adventures in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the whole the genre justifies itself . Whether it could do so indefinitely I should not like to say ; it would depend largely , no doubt , not only on the composer but on good taste and good luck in the choice of poems . The purist may , with fair reason , object to the title of symphony ' being given to works of this class , for there is little analogy with the orchestral symphony beyond the fact that the new work is in four sections , corresponding superficially to the ( a ) Introduction and Allegro , ( b ) Adagio , ( c ) Scherzo , ( d ) Finale . Titles apart , the choral symphony ' is just a setting of four poems ( or extracts from poems ) for chorus and a solo voice , with orchestral accompaniment . The form , whether new or old , is of no importance , and the nomenclature of less ; all that matters is the quality of Holst 's music . London will have an opportunity of hearing the work in a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here to sing it at the first Philharmonic concert . There will be a chance then , perhaps , to discuss the music in closer detail ; here I propose to deal only with some general aesthetic aspects of the work . The text is taken wholly from Keats ? the Prelude , Song and Bacchanal ( the first movement of the symphony ) from Endymion ' , ( the Invocation to Pan and the Roundelay , Beneath my palm trees , by the river side ' ) , the Scherzo from Ever let the fancy roam ' and the Folly 's Song ' , the Finale from the Spirit Song ' , the Hymn to Apollo ' and the Ode to Apollo ' ;  | in the slow movement the Ode on a Grecian Urn ' is set entire . Hoist 's is the most restlessly enquiring and adventuring mind in the English music of today . He is experimenting simultaneously in three fields ? that of harmony , that of rhythm in itself , and that of musical rhythm in a new synthesis with poetic rhythm . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the disparaging sense in which that word is generally applied to some of the wilder musical adventures of today . Hoist knows perfectly well what he is doing in every bar ; his irregular rhythms move in complete freedom ; the harmonies that look curious on paper are logical enough to the ear ; and his way of setting words to music is at bottom only a reversion , at long last , to the fundamental principles of English musical prosody that were well understood by the Tudor composers . It is to this last point that I want to devote the remainder of my first article . Vocal music everywhere is at last emancipating itself from the tyranny of the classical instrumental forms , with their fondness for short and symmetrical rhythmic phrases , and from the sing-song rhythms of the German Lied . The simple rhythms of the ordinary German poem , which remained unchanged , broadly speaking , from the time of Walther von der Vogelweid until recently , invited a corresponding rhythmic simplicity in the musical setting . When Germany took the lead in music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel and obeyed the same laws : the type of phrase that did well as a symphonic ' subject ' ? short , melodically clear-cut and expressive , and rhythmically definite ? did equally well for the ordinary German song . In practically every other country ) also the vocal line took on much of the character of the instrumental , because of the strong unconscious pull ' of the instrumentally developed sense of design ; and after the great achievements of romantic German song had been added to those of German instrumental music , the tendency everywhere became more pronounced , on the part of vocal writers , to think in terms of musical metrics rather than in terms of poetic rhythm . In a fine Tudor song the longs and shorts of the melody , its accents , its caesura , its length of phrase , are largely determined by the corresponding elements in the verse ; in  | later and modern times the tendency has been to submerge all the subtler rhythmical qualities of the verse under an evenly moving melodic flood , in which every wave is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trough , strong accent and weak , come at virtually corresponding distances each time . Against this instrumental handling of words there came a revolt , partly conscious , partly unconscious , in the 19th century . It took different forms at different times in different countries . In Russia , Dargomijski , and after him Moussorgsky , tried to translate speech realistically into music , to turn the melodic line into a sort of recitative , in which the time values and the accents of the spoken line were reproduced as accurately as the nature of music and of singing would allow . These Russians failed , for the most part , because they misunderstood the nature of the problem . They saw it only as an affair of realism ? of copying nature , as they put it . That is always the point of view of the amateur in music ; and in spite of his genius there was a good deal of the amateur even in Moussorgsky . Neither he nor Dargomijski saw that the problem , though , sure enough , it was secondarily one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical ear is to be addressed and appealed to , it must be in terms of music qua music , not of music as an imitation of nature . To write an indeterminate vocal line that shall stress just the accents that would be stressed in speaking the words , and go up or down in just the same places and as near as possible to the same extent as the speaking voice would under similar circumstances , is not at all a difficult thing to do . Such realistic settings of the words as we have , for instance , in Moussorgsky 's Children 's Songs are within the powers of a thousand composers for every one who would find it within his powers to write the Mushrooms ' or the Hopak ' . The genre came to nothing : Moussorgsky wrote a whole opera in it ( ' The Matchmaker ' ) , which he himself seems to have thought an improvement on Boris Godounov . ' Posterity does not agree with him ; the genre is too essentially non-musical to get much hold upon the musical listener . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , as musician , to the poet , being content just  | to speak the words to music . To many of us , these are now the weakest portions of the opera ; they seem to us to evade , not solve , the problem , and to be so easy as hardly to be worth while . Operatic composers in general have not shown , since Pelleas and Melisande ' , any desire to adopt the genre ; it involves too complete a surrender of the composer 's right as a musician . Hugo Wolf attacked the problem in another way , and solved it . He gave back to the poet most of the rights that had been filched from him , but did not encroach upon the composer 's rights in order to do so ; he did not , like Moussorgsky , and Debussy in his weaker passages , rob the musician Peter to pay the poet Paul . On the contrary , he gave the musician a liberty he had not hitherto possessed in the song . Rhymes , of course , had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period : no modern song composer pays , or can pay , much attention to these . But so far as the rest of the poem was concerned , Wolf treated the poet with a new respect . He did not , as Schubert sometimes did , throw the musical accent on to the wrong word to suit the exigencies of his melody , or treat the poetic line merely as a pretext for a beautiful quasiinstrumental phrase . He let the words roll out of the singer 's mouth with the same accents , the same high and low lights , the same punctuation , the same length of sentence , as if they were being spoken . But being a great musician , with a technique far beyond Moussorgsky 's , he had no need to sacrifice the music on the altar of the poetry . He saw that the problem was primarily one of counterpoint : the voice part had to follow the laws of free melodic declamation , the accompaniment had to develop independently along purely musical lines , and the two had to be welded together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two may be , especially rhythmically , they must go together , and in the process of going together they must make music . It took a great technique , combined with a marvellous imagination , to do this . Hoist has approached the problem from yet another direction . I shall discuss his method of handling English poetry in another article .  | 18th October 1925 MILTON praised Henry Lawes for being the first ( which he certainly was not ) who .. taught our English music how to span Words with just note and accent , not to scan With Midas ' ears , committing short and long . The historians , from Burney and Hawkins to Dr Ernest Walker , have dealt rather severely with Lawes and the claims made for him by his contemporaries . The trouble was that Lawes was not a good enough composer to make his generally careful scansion matter very much ; it is not much use giving syllables their right accentual values if the melodic line is deficient in musical values . The eighteenth century , as typified in Burney and Hawkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , for , as Hawkins 's remarks in particular show , the smooth symmetrical Italian opera form of melody had taken such possession of men 's minds that they were puzzled and irritated by any vocal line the even flow of which was broken every now and then to give this syllable or the other its verbal due . Hawkins described Lawes 's music as being neither recitative nor air , but in so precise a medium i.e. middle point between both that a name is wanting for it ' ; the great and almost only excellence ' of his songs is the exact correspondence between the accent of the music and the quantities of the verse . ' Just accentuation of itself will not redeem otherwise poor music ; and nothing is gained by drawing attention , as Hubert Parry sometimes did in his songs , to the words by a niggling nicety of accent and quantity where it does not matter in the least , ? ostentatiously writing such a word as weather ' , for example , as a quaver followed by a dotted crotchet to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows , that the first syllable of the word should have stress but not duration . The problem of setting English verse to music is much more complicated than this . It is possible , of course , to transgress against the poet and still make lovely and immortal music ;  | who is going to turn his back on Wie bist du , meine Konigin ' because of the wrongful pause in the melody at the end of the poet 's first line , the sense of which is not completed till the second ? But when all is said , it remains true that people with a feeling for poetry as well as for music will always desire a perfect fitting of the two in point of accent , phrase length , and so on . Of late years both the English and the German composers have given a great deal of attention to the subject ; and in England no one has explored it more thoroughly and successfully than Holst , who has the good luck to be an excellent composer as well as a sensitive poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is not the slave of any rigid scheme ; he gets some of his finest effects in irregular measures , but if the effect can be got equally well in a regular measure he does not hesitate to use it . In the Choral Symphony ' he often employs a seven-eight measure that has the advantage of allowing the singer to stress musically the weighty syllable of a line ( or part of a line ) , and at the same time keep it as near speech as it is to music , by depriving the stress-note of the extra and superfluous time-value it would have in the usual setting . Take , for instance , Keats 's lines : That even Holst can sometimes be led astray by a metric scheme is shown by the too great value he allows to the first syllable of kissing ' ; the first high light in that line should be the cym ' of cymbals ' . Errors of this kind , however , are rare with him . The strong caesura after spake ' in the first line gets its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , that has no caesura , would have been rightly carried on but for the unfortunate stressing of in one long phrase , with the high lights delicately touched in on cym- ' and mer- ' . The advantages of the seven-eight scheme may be seen in this  | example ; trumpet ' gets precisely its right verbal values , which it would not have had if the notes had been either two quavers ( three-four time ) or a dotted crotchet and quaver ( four-four time ) ; the voice poses itself just as long as is necessary on the trump- ' , and not a fraction of a second more . The point is illustrated again in the following : The score of the Choral Symphony ' teems with similar felicities . When variety is necessary , Hoist 's instinct supplies it . The line The earnest trumpet spake , and silver thrills ' is paralleled precisely , so far as syllables , stresses , quantities and caesura are concerned , in the line Ah , happy , happy boughs , that can not shed ' . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the normal eight-eight No. a . A , happy , happy boughs t that oannot shed Your lea memoir ev . ea bid the Spreng a ? daeu  | The justification of the change is to be found in the tempo . The earnest trumpet ' line is sung in quick time ; the pace is about that of the speaking voice , and a peculiar pleasure is given us by the musical phrase slipping off the tongue virtually as the spoken phrase would do . The Ah , happy boughs ' is part of the adagio movement of the symphony . The slow tempo and the nature of the harmonisation predispose us to listen with relatively more of our musical and less of our poetic sense than in the former case , and the pausing of the voices on boughs ' and leaves ' for a fraction longer than they had previously done on trump ' - and sil- ' gives us a musical delight that we should have been unwilling to sacrifice for strict verbal metrics . Even here , however , Holst shows his instinct for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unwearied , For ever piping songs for ever new . To have kept the same phrasing inside the bars for this as for the two preceding lines would have meant false accents at certain places . Hoist gets everything right by entering after the bar-line instead of before itso that the strong beats of the bar coincide once more with the strong beats of the words .  | 2nd May 1926 ON Tuesday evening all the intellect of Chelsea was gathered into one small room to hear Facade ' , which Mr Osbert Sitwell , in a preliminary speech that was rather too crossgrained to be quite the right thing on so festive an occasion , rightly described as an entertainment . And a jolly good entertainment it was in many ways , and we should have enjoyed it still more had we been able to sit on cushions , in the daring , Bohemian , Chelsea way , instead of the uncomfortably close-packed little chairs of the New Chenil Galleries . I gathered that this entertainment , or something like it , was given some years ago ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Noel Coward ' ; but whether this disturbing sentence in the advertisement was meant as a criticism of the entertainment or an epitaph upon Mr Coward I can not say . There were one or two things in the show with which one might legitimately feel bored , but nothing to shock anyone . Some one ( was it Osbert ? ) declaimed Miss Sitwell 's poems through a megaphone placed in the mouth of a big face painted , half in white , half in pink , on the curtain , while a small orchestra , also behind the scenes , poured out the music of Mr W. T. Walton . How much I enjoyed the fun may be estimated from the fact that I ? a critic ? actually not only stayed to the end but added my voice and my umbrella to the clamour for encores of the best items ' long after the official proceedings were finished . Mr Sitwell , in his prefatory remarks , half hinted , apologetically , that the speaker of the words might not be able to get them all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of them there was always the music to fall back upon . His scruples were unnecessary . It is true that against the jolly stridencies of Mr W alton 's scoring what we got from the megaphone was often sound rather than sense , but for my part I felt that one or two of the poems were rather improved than otherwise by our  | not being able to catch the words . We got the essential things all right , such as ' Or the sound of the onycha When the phoca has the pica In the palace of the Queen Chinee ! ' ( from the Trio for Two Cats and a Trombone ' ) . But really the words mattered very little , in the majority of cases , as against the music . The experience was another illustration of how necessary it is to find the right instrument for a tune , in poetry as in music . If I have missed , in my study , the inner meaning of some of Miss Sitwell 's ingeniously wrought verses , it was because in my innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Osbert Sitwell ( if it were he at the back of the megaphone ) , showed me that they really demand a method of reading of their own . Get Kreisler to play one of Paul Whiteman 's shirtsleeves tunes on his violin , and the tune will sound nothing . Hear the free-and-easy thing on the trombone or the baritone saxophone and you are bound to admit that it has its qualities and its virtues ; with tunes , as with people , the clothes are almost as important as what is inside them . Now when I read this of Miss Sitwell 's : Long steel grass The white soldiers pass The light is braying like an ass . See The tall Spanish jade With hair black as nightshade Worn as a cockade ! Flee Her eyes ' gasconade And her gown 's parade ( As stiff as a brigade ) . Tee-hee ! ' or this ' Beside the castanetted sea Where stalks Il Capitaneo Swaggart braggodocio  | Sword and moustachio ? He Is green as a cassada And his hair is an Armada , ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hotel at Hell , ' the device of the broken line misses fire with me , because I am not used to that sort of thing in the poetry I was brought up on . But when the megaphone bellows the words at me with a sledgehammer insistence on the See ' , Flee ' , When ' , and Sir ' , I get the poet 's idea , and , I must confess , enjoy it . These , in fact , are saxophone tunes , not violin melodies , and must be played on the right instrument , with the right technique , and in the right spirit . The reciter brought out also all sorts of queer delightful rhythms and cross rhythms and unexpected stabbing accents that gave me , as a musician whose trade is in these things and who therefore knows what 's what where they are concerned , a vast delight . It is all very well for old-fashioned purists to say that poetry should not be read through a megaphone . The answer is that the Sitwells know what they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond a doubt , Tuesday 's reading of some of these poems gave us a delight in them that we had not previously felt . To hear Osbert and the megaphone pounding out ' THE Trumpet and the drum , And the martial cornet come To make the people dumb ? But WE Wo n't wait for sly-foot night ' with a rhythm and an accent like those of a military march , was to see the poem ? for the first time with many of us ? from the poet 's point of view . But the entertainment owed a great deal also to Mr Walton 's music . All I knew of this young man 's before Tuesday was a horrible quartet of his that was given at the Royal College  | three or four years ago . On the strength of this , I take leave to dislike intensely Mr Walton 's serious music ? if , indeed , that quartet was serious and was music , both of which I doubt . But as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . Some of it was too imitative of the sort of thing we used to hear in the great days of about 1920 , when M. Diaghileff was writing ? or at all events signing ? those wonderful letters to the papers in which a new scheme of musical values was foreshadowed , Beethoven and Brahms and Elgar being reduced to the status of mere straphangers by the Stravinskys and Saties and Prokofieffs and Milhauds of the new dawn . Here and there Mr Walton could be seen diving into that sequestered and now stagnant pool and coming up with bits of Stravinsky sticking in his honest English hair ; indeed , now and then the music was so like Stravinsky that it might have been written by Eric Fogg . But when the true-born Briton settled down to the true-born Briton 's historic role of guying things that have a natural touch of absurdity about them he was , as the modern stylist would say , priceless . Here is obviously a humorous musical talent of the first order ; nothing so good in the mock-serious line of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , the Polka ' , the Jodelling Song ' , and I do like to be beside the seaside ' ; and the deft workmanship , especially in the orchestration , made the heart of the listening musician glad . The curious thing was the happiness of the correspondence between all the factors of the affair ; the music , the words , the megaphone , and the piquant phrasing of the lines by the reciter were as much bone of each other 's bone and flesh of each other 's flesh as the words and the music are of each other in Tristan ' or Pelloas ' . At its best , Facade ' was the jolliest entertainment of the season . Mr Playfair ought to incorporate the four numbers I have mentioned in Riverside Nights ' . And Mr Walton ought to seek out a librettist after his own heart and give us a little musical comedy in the jazz style .  | 10th November I929 No composer who has ever lived being everybody 's composer , I should not be at all surprised to be told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is room in this infinite universe for all varieties of taste . So long as people trust simply to their sensitised plates , regardless of whether the plate has had any special preparation for a particular piece of photography or indeed has any more natural capacity for taking an image faithfully than a dinner plate has , we must be prepared for all sorts of opinions upon the same subject , and learn to look upon them all with an amused philosophical detachment . As we were leaving Queen 's Hall the other evening after a performance of the Mass of Life ' that had moved many of us as no other concert experience has done for many a day , a young lady was heard to remark languidly to her companion , Gives you the dem creeps , does n't it ? ' Evidently a sensitised plate can in some cases register only desensitised platitude . If some people are blind to what others of us regard as the extraordinary beauty of Delius 's music , we must just agree to differ on a matter on which there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when these or other people keep assuring us that the music of Delius is all alike , discussion of a sort becomes possible , because here we are dealing with facts . No one would seek to deny that Delius has a partiality for certain harmonic progressions . These are called his mannerisms ; and because even the casual listener is conscious of the frequent appearance of the same generic formula ( for that is what a mannerism is ) , he is inclined , in his haste , to see only the formula and miss the manifold uses to which the formula is put . I can readily understand some people declaring that they can not perceive any distinction between this work of Delius and that : I would merely point out that the inability to perceive a distinction is no proof that the distinction does not exist . It is all a matter of natural fineness of apprehension plus extent of experience . To make use of an old illustration ,  | to the townsman all the faces in a flock are alike , whereas to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that this inability to see the fine shades of distinction between one Delius work and another is a sure proof that the objector does not know his Delius apart from chance contact with him in the concert room . The tables can easily be turned on these objectors . In the first place , our experiences of poetry show us that a writer may have the most pronounced of manners ' and yet , within this manner , turn out no two works that are really alike . If we concentrate only on the externals of the Browning idiom , for instance , we merely perceive that it is the same in one work after another . But the reader who should assert that , because the Cardinal Ogniben of A Soul 's Tragedy ' speaks the same rather peculiar language as the old Pope in The Ring and the Book ' , the two characters say only the same thing , would simply write himself down an ass . And to anyone who has steeped himself in Delius there is something very foolish about the theory that because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a mere half-dozen things in it . A little modesty on the part of these good people would not be amiss . They might reflect upon the obvious fact that others of us can listen with increasing interest to concert after concert of Delius 's music . We have no more liking for being bored than they have ; and it is surely a fair presumption that if one Delius work were very much like another our interest in him would soon die out . Is it too much to ask them to believe that although they can not get below the external similarity of the language to the variety of things that is being said in this language others of us can , much to our delight ? Is it strictly modest of them to elevate their own impercipience to the rank of a norm for more discriminating ears ? Because , to their unskilled eye , ten fabrics in blue look all very much alike , must they force their crude opinion on the trained dyeing chemist who can perceive ten well-defined tints in them , and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the second place , granted that Delius has a language of his own that is manifestly much the same , in its externals , in most of his works , how does he differ in this respect , we may  | ask , from any other composer ? The objector will say that the proposition is not true , or not true to anything like the same extent , of any other composer . I venture to assure him that he is quite wrong . Here again he is merely arguing from his own lack of perception . For some years I have been carrying out an intensive analysis of the idioms of composers that has yielded some curious and astonishing results . I have no hesitation in saying that there is not a single composer who is not , in the last resort , simply a machine unconsciously reproducing the same basic formulae in work after work . That these formulae have not been generally perceived is only another proof of how musical criticism has failed at the very rudiments of its job because , in its childish vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has made a proper survey of the foundations . We critics have been so preoccupied with our naive reactions to a composer and with the equally naive attempt to persuade other people that if they react to him differently from us they are wrong , that we have never given any attention to what it is in a particular composer 's mind that goes a long way towards making his music what it is . So far as the main texture and the ordonance of his music are concerned , every composer is merely a bundle of a dozen or so constantly recurring formulae . This is not a matter of conjecture : it is a plain fact that can be proved up to the hilt by quotation . I would explain it in this way : in its subconscious depths the human mind is , to a large extent , a machine , and the machine , in order to economise energy , unconsciously settles upon certain lines of least resistance ; the same emergency arising , as it is always doing in one work and another , the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances of the moment , and generally so subtly modified that for generation after generation millions of listeners have never even suspected its presence . When , therefore , someone tells me that when he is listening to Delius in the mass he is conscious of the same formula , manner , mannerism ? call it what you like ? recurring again and again , my reply is that I go through precisely the same experience when I am listening to Beethoven , Wagner , Brahms , Chopin , Weber , Schubert , Schumann , Grieg , Mozart , Elgar ,  | Strauss , and other composers . What the anti-Delian imagines to be a characteristic of Delius qua Delius is only a characteristic of him and others qua composer . ( In no two composers , by the way , are the formulae the same , which is a very remarkable fact when we consider that there are only twelve notes in a chromatic octave. )  | 7th January 1934 THE game of comparing composers with poets or painters does not seem so popular as it used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get together a collection of these supposed analogies , if only to illustrate the change in taste from one generation to another . Some of the judgments of our forefathers are really beyond comprehension today . Ask a dozen cultured people now to which painter they would compare Rossini , and while the whole twelve replies might be different , it is pretty safe to assume that none of them would be Titian ' ; yet it was to Titian that Liszt , expressing no doubt the general opinion of his epoch , compared Rossini ! One or two of these old comparisons still give us occasion for thought ? such as David Friedrich Strauss 's description of Gluck as the Lessing of the opera ' ; but as a rule they merely make the modern reader smile . There used to be one comparison that everyone thought perfectly safe , that of Mozart and Raphael . That was well enough in the days when all sorts of excellent people thought the good Raphael to be the greatest of painters . But would the comparison of Mozart and Raphael be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A modern critic assures us that Raphael , the marvellous creator of images , was a mediocre colourist . . . and . . . his drawing was often commonplace and nerveless . There is no picture by him in which an impartial critic may not find loose , inaccurate , and inexpressive contours . . . . Not without reason has the decadence of art been dated from the apogee of Raphael 's glory . The worship of Raphael , the divine painter ' , has had its day . His works must now be analysed and judged one by one , not as those of a god in the form of a painter , but as the creations of an artist of genius , fallible like the rest of mankind , and deified by irresponsible enthusiasm . All that is truly great in his art  | can but gain by being studied critically , not in the spirit of depreciation , but , on the other hand , without a blind determination to admire at any price . The day may yet come when even Mozart will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Salomon Reinach for the study of Raphael . That the conventional Mozart-Raphael analogy still holds sway , however , in many minds ? not in the modern critical but in the ancient adoring sense ? is shown by its cropping up in one of the articles in the recent Mozart ' number of the Revue Musicale ' . Still , there is a good deal to be said for these comparisons of musicians and artists , if only we do not carry them too far . No one composer is the precise and complete analogy to any one artist ; but there may be one factor in a composer 's make-up that brings him into line with a similar factor in the make-up of some painter or sculptor or other . If I were asked to name the artistic equivalent to Bach , I should plump for Bernini and some dozen or two other leading lights of baroque art . The comparison may cause some readers to raise their eyebrows , but that , I venture to suggest , will only be because they have studied critically and complementally neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , two or three Bachs , that seemingly have hardly any connection with each other . The general public knows , for the most part , only what I have called the jigging , jogging , Bach ; it does not realise that the works of Bach that give it so much naive pleasure are merely the small talk of a mighty mind , the gay , airy , neatly shopfinished things ? or nothings ? that any good talker , desirous only of amusing himself and coming down for the moment to the intellectual level of his listeners , can toss out of his sleeve with the utmost ease between the soup and the fish . Of the greater and infinitely more fascinating Bach , the Bach of the Passions , the cantatas , and the chorale preludes , the general public knows next to nothing . And this is the Bach who turns out , on careful examination , to have the closest analogies with certain aspects of baroque . Baroque is not a phenomenon of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries alone . It is a recurrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is something  | that always happens when two main factors coincide in point of time ? a great store of technique , transmitted and personal , and an enormous heightening of sensibility . When this occurs we get , on the one hand , an insistence , that sometimes becomes exaggerated , on images of spiritual tension and suffering , on the other hand a kind of lust of technique , that shows itself in the elaboration , sometimes the over-elaboration , of one favourite feature of the creator 's art . It is somewhat astonishing that no writer , so far as my own reading goes , has pointed out the many analogies between the art of Bach and that of the masters of baroque . This is probably because students of music are as a rule too much occupied with their own problems to make an intensive study of other branches of art , while the students of pictorial and plastic art , though as a rule they have a method far superior to that of the average writer on music , necessarily lack the detailed knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sister art . But occasionally they make a really good shot , as when the German art-historian , August Mayer , draws a comparison between the baroque music of Gluck and the Spanish baroque sculptor Gregorio Fernandez ( Hernandez . ) I think I have already pointed out that had musical criticism ' existed in the days of Bach , he would have been solemnly censured in all the papers for two faults ' , an occasional overinsistence , in his harmonies , on images of spiritual suffering , and a tendency to over-elaborate his cadences for the sheer joy , as we may perhaps put it , of spreading himself . Fortunately for him , musical criticism ' had in his days not yet attained to the full glory of puerility it has achieved in ours ; so that when we now , some two centuries later , become aware of these qualities in his art , we do not react against them on the ground that they are signs of a deplorable decadence ' , but survey them and study them with dispassionate interest as phenomena that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , in the course of the development of every art . Bach 's harmonic over-intensity under the stress of some image of religious suffering or ecstasy finds a thousand analogies in the religious pictures and statues of the masters of baroque ; while his elaborate cadences  | seem to me the perfect analogy , in music , to that luxury in the treatment of drapery that is so marked a characteristic in l3ernini and others . ( It was a noticeable characteristic also , by the way , of some of the sculpture of the Hellenistic period : and the same basic impulses repeat themselves in all the arts in some generation or other ) . The truth is that there was a good deal more of the potential opera composer in Bach than is generally supposed . He would not work specifically in that genre because opera as it then was offered too few opportunities for art so complex as his . But opera was everywhere in the air at that time , and it halfunconsciously influenced many writers and musicians who , for one reason and another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neumeister , who set a new fashion in cantata texts ? Bach set several of them to music ? expressly laid it down that the cantata was part of an opera ' . The growing tendency among church composers to import dramatic methods into religious music aroused a good deal of opposition at that time ; and Spitta rightly draws attention to the close analogy between the endeavour to express personal emotion on the boards of a theatre ' and the transcendental subjectivity ' of much of the poetry of the Pietists . In a thousand instances in his cantatas and Passions and chorale preludes Bach pays tribute , in his own way , to the heightened nervous sensibility that was then seeking its outlet in opera , as it had formerly done in baroque painting and sculpture . Corresponding analogies might be worked out between certain aspects of the art of Hugo Wolf and the phase of Greek sculpture that is represented by Scopas and his followers . Wolf 's insistence , in his more tragic songs , upon the utmost harmonic poignancy is paralleled by the tension in Scopas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be in the least fanciful to say that in each case the effect is obtained by much the same means , regard being had to the difference between the natures of the two arts : Wolf 's minor ninth does for his tragic music just what Scopas did for his agonised faces by deepening the eye socket , and by that heavy fold of flesh over the outer corner of the eye that he so frequently uses to get an effect of tense concentration .  | A whole book , indeed , might be written on the analogies between the music of Wolf and certain phenomena in the later developments of Greek sculpture . But here , as everywhere else , we must beware of wholesale analogies of the type that delighted the simpler sense of our fathers . No one composer corresponds so completely to any one painter or sculptor as to justify our calling him the This or That of music . The Wolf of Mi hvoll komm ' ich and beladen ' is true Scopas ; but we must find another analogy for the Wolf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good deal of rococo in Mozart , and a good deal that would justify us in regarding him as the musical equivalent of Watteau , there is also a good deal in his music for which we must find a very different analogy .  | 17th June 1934 ELGAR , Hoist , and now Delius ! This is a year of mourning for English music . If the public , as distinct from one 's private , grief is less poignant in the case of Delius than in those of the other two , it is because we had already realised that his activity was at an end . Elgar 's mind , at the time of his death , was working eagerly not only upon his third symphony but upon the opera he had had on hand for so many years ; and there is no knowing what might still have come from a mind so penetrating and boldly speculative as that of Holst . But in Delius 's case , though his mind remained astonishingly strong until quite recently , the physical handicap became , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Zur Ruh , zur Ruh , ihr muden Glieder ! Schliesst fest euch zu , ihr Augenlider ! Delius was one of those rare composers whom it is impossible to fit into any of the usual convenient categories : from first to last he was purely and wholly himself . One looks in vain in his music for any influence ' whatever ; at most we can detect occasionally a slight similarity between some of his harmonic progressions and those of Grieg , but even here it is not a matter of actual influence , but of a certain congenital correspondence between the two minds in this one small corner of music . For good or for ill , Delius was barred by his very constitution from either profiting by or being damaged by the example of any of his predecessors or contemporaries . Though he studied for a time at Leipzig , Leipzig left nothing whatever of its characteristic mark upon him . Like Berlioz , he must have worked hard during his formative days in a way entirely his own , guided by a sure instinct of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of technique , and what had better be rejected as being finally unassimilable by a mind like his , and inapplicable to purposes like his .  | It is true that here and there his music prompts the thought that in casting from him what he felt to be alien to him in the conventional technique he threw away also something by which , could he have made the essence if not the doctrine of it part of himself , his own technique might have profited . There are occasions , that is to say , especially in his earlier work on a large scale , when we feel that his hand is not quite subdued to the medium in which it is working , when the notes do not represent with perfect accuracy what it was in his mind to say . But one finally decides that he was right in refusing at all costs the assistance of the standard recipes ? the use of which Brahms so liberally permitted himself when he was in a temporary structural difficulty ? and in preferring to set down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an occasional awkwardness or lack of ideal clearness . Minds like his and Berlioz 's have to pay the penalty of their originality ; they have not only to find their own individual expression but create for themselves their own individual forms . In Delius 's case the problem soon resolved itself into an intensive exploration of his own inner world as it was in the beginning , rather than a spatial enlargement of that world . No two minds could be more different in orientation than his and Brahms 's ; but in one respect they were curiously alike . Sink a shaft into any two or three of Brahms 's works , dating from his first , his middle , and his last period , and you come upon the same metal . There are minds , such as that of Wagner , that changed their tissue so much in the course of the years that one can hardly believe that their first and their last works were written by the same man . There are other minds , such as that of Brahms , that appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience works upon them they do indeed fill the native mould with a substance of ever greater strength and beauty , but in essence both the mould and the filling remain to to the end what they were at the beginning . So it was with Delius . His music is sometimes reproached with being the same in one work after another . To some extent this is true ; the same rhythms , the same harmonies , the same exquisite washes of colour , recur again and again : sometimes , even , he unconsciously repeats himself literally , a certain passage in  | A Mass of Life ' , for instance , being an almost literal reproduction of one in Sea Drift ' . But with Delius , as with Brahms , though the music remains superficially the same throughout the years , its inner tissue and timbre and clang are subtly modified in one work after another . In Delius 's case , perhaps , one requires a special sensibility , and considerable acquaintance with the music , before these fine shades of distinction between works that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but of their existence there can be no doubt . His music is full of paradoxes . One 's first impression of some of it is that it is formless : later one discovers that it has a form , and a perfectly adequate form , of its own . In this respect posterity will do him more justice than is possible to the ordinary listener of today , who has been herded by precept and example into confusing truly organic musical form with the merely schematic : some day it will be recognised that a work like Paris ' , in which the nature and the pressure of the thinking evolve their own perfectly congruent shape and articulation from the inside , instead of docilely accepting a standardised scheme applied to the music from the outside , represents a higher achievement in form than is to be met with in many a dozen classical ' symphonies . Another paradox is that while his music seems to glide along with limbs relaxed , it is often , in reality , extraordinarily vigorous , as many a page in A Mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music of this kind , as in the bodies of the cat tribe , the muscles can put forth the maximum of energy with the minimum of visible effort . Delius 's mind in general was one of exceptional strength ; and only listeners who are unable to get past the smoothness of the texture of his music to the thought that is functioning within can be under any illusion as to the same strength being there in his music . If his mind , from first to last , moved within an orbit that seems limited in comparison with that of minds like Wagner 's or Beethoven 's , it gradually developed the maximum of light and heat within its own orbit . A penetrating and realistic thinker in matters of the intellect , as a musical artist his whole life was devoted to the progressive realisation , in ever clearer forms and ever more poignant expression , of the one primal  | ideal of beauty , a beauty that is eager in the earlier works , passionate and richly coloured in those of his middle period , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest works , where he seems to recognise regretfully at last , as we must all do , that this hard world is not to be shaped by the artist and dreamer to his heart 's desire . In the music of his final period , with its poignant nostalgia for a beauty that is fast vanishing from the earth , we hear , as in no other music but that of Mahler 's , the sunset cry of wounded kings ' , the last regretful murmuring of ancient talismans which , in its strange blend of credulity and negation , the distracted new world has for the time being rejected . With the death of Delius there has died a world the corresponding loveliness to which it will be a long time before humanity can create for itself again . It may be that , as some think , we are now in the first hour before a new dawn in music . But that hour is grey and chilly : and those of us who have been drunk with the beauty and the glory of the sunset of civilisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melting colours of the cloud-shapes of the music of this last great representative of that old dead world . Delius has summed it all up for us in his moving setting of the no less moving words that Nietzsche puts into the mouth of his Zarathustra : O man ! Take heed ! What saith deep midnight 's voice indeed ? I slept my sleep ? , From deepest dream I 've woke , and plead : ? ' The world is deep . And deeper than the day could read . Deep is its woe ? , Joy deeper still than grief can be : Woe saith : Hence ! Go ! But joys all want eternity ? , ? Want deep , profound eternity ! '  | BACH AND HANDEL : PAST AND PRESENT VIEWS 3rd March 1935 WHEN the examining counsel asked the witness how he could be so sure that the exact distance from point A to point B was so many feet so many inches , he received the answer that he had measured it . Asked why he had measured it , witness replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . ' The musical world is supposed to be frightfully agitated just now ? though I have seen no striking evidence of it myself so far ? over the fact that if Handel and Bach were still alive they would now be 250 years old , Handel having been born on February 23rd , 1685 , and Bach on March 21st . On occasions like this we journalists are of course expected to say something . For my part I can see no more and no less reason for writing about a composer on his birthday than for writing about him on any other day . If then I follow the example of my colleagues and take Bach and Handel for my subject today , it is only because I know that if I do n't , some intelligent person or other is sure to write and ask me why . I was mildly amused a little while ago to read that Bach had had a fine innings lately and it was now time that Handel went to the wicket . That remark , I fancy , was prompted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last few years . But the Promenades , excellent institution though they are in their way , are not the universe , or even the British Isles : and if we run a line through the musical life of this country as a whole during the last two hundred years or so , I think we shall find that it is Handel who has always had the greater public vogue . He has always been , and probably always will be , the one of the pair who can contribute most to the greatest happiness of the greatest number . On the other hand , if we may judge from the specialist literature on the subject , it is Bach who keeps the minds of thoughtful musicians working  | hardest and most constantly . What I call specialist musical literature ? i.e. , the study by sensitive experts of the constitution and the working of a composer 's mind , as distinguished from the dilettante literature of the rapturous record of sensitisedplate reactions ? is relatively small in the case of Handel ; whereas in the case of Bach it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About the Art of Fugue ' , for example , which is hardly a work ' at all in the popular sense of the term , the last few years alone have seen the production of an astonishing quantity of literature , culminating in Erich Schwebsch 's volume of 350 pages ( 1931 ) . We might sum it all up , perhaps , by saying that Handel will always be the public 's musician , one of the greatest and most enjoyable of composers , while Bach is and will always be the musician 's musician . In spite of the fact that the two were born in the same year , lived for practically the same length of time , and , Handel 's operas apart , employed much the same vocabulary , forms , and technical means , their minds show more differences than resemblances . This fact is not , as is generally supposed , the discovery of today . Our great-grandfathers were perfectly conscious of it ; indeed , when we read the discussions of the pair in the musical literature of the last years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we feel that there is little that is essential to be added to them today . We can fill in the picture with a thousand fresh details , but the main outlines of it were virtually settled long ago . Perhaps our grandfathers were even more acutely conscious of the fundamental differences between the mind of Bach and that of Handel than the average concertgoer today is , after his much wider experience of the two . During the last few years more than one investigator has given intensive study to the analogies between Bach 's music and Gothic architecture . But Weber , although he could not have known one-tenth of the works of Bach that are familiar to us today , not only hit upon that analogy but anticipated the later critical thesis that Bach is more of a romantic ' than Handel . Discussing these two giant minds ' , as he calls them , in an article of 1821 , Weber says that they are basically so different that they seem to belong to different epochs . Bach 's individuality was really romantic , fundamentally German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He puts forward as a vital characteristic of Bach 's style not only the purity and logic of his linear counterpoint , but the extraordinary variety and subtlety of his rhythms within the parts ? a point upon which the latest research and stylistic analysis have especially concentrated . ( Handel 's rhythms are also varied and subtle , but only melodically , in the upper line of a harmony , not in every limb and fragment of a polyphonic tissue as is the case with Bach . ) Weber goes on to compare Bach 's music with a Gothic cathedral ' . Rochlitz , in an article published in book form in 1832 , though seemingly written some years before then , makes a good point when he compares Handel 's music with the art of Rubens at his best , and Bach 's with that of Diirer . He is as conscious as any of us today that Handel 's gaze was turned more outward and Bach 's more inward : Handel makes us , he says , see the thing as he saw it , while Bach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These ancients saw as clearly as any expert of today that the two men 's minds differed fundamentally in their attitude towards polyphony . Handel , with the public listener always in his mind 's eye , does not insist upon his counterpoint after the moment when he conceives it would be a little irksome for the average man to follow him ( a point that is implicit in Hawkins 's description of Handel 's improvisation at the organ ) : Bach , with no public to think of , lets the inner logic of his subjects have its own way , purely for their own sake , for his , and for those after him who can delight , after enthusiastic and painstaking study , in the musical result . People like Rochlitz were as well aware as any of us today that there was something in Bach 's mind that made it , for all time , the epitome of the musical mind at its most truly musical : this , we say as we examine this or that great work of his , is how music might write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception and the final result . Hence it comes about that we listen to Bach and Handel today in altogether different ways . If a Handel work is not first-rate we just leave it on one side and pass on to another of his that is ; the degree of aesthetic pleasure given us is the determining factor . But there are dozens of Bach works which ,  | though they communicate no particular aesthetic pleasure in the commoner sense of that term , still draw us to them again and again . Few of the fugues in the Art of Fugue ' are as pleasing ' to the ordinary listener as those in the Forty-eight ' or those for the organ ; but all the same we take down from our shelves the Art of Fugue ' many more times than we do any of the Handel fugues , splendid as some of these are . It is not that we take a dry-as-dust interest in Bach 's technique for its own sake ; it is simply that we feel again and again that here the spirit of music is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the delighted feeling that this perception gives us is something that on occasion can transcend aesthetic ' enjoyment as the man in the street conceives it . It is impossible , perhaps , to make the man in the street see what it is in Bach that endlessly absorbs and thrills the musician ; it is difficult , indeed , to express it in words to one 's own satisfaction . But all the same it is there , and it is this that accounts for the vast literature devoted to Bach analysis . That analysis is not mere analytical chemistry for its own dry laboratory sake : it is the effort of the musical mind within us to penetrate to the profoundest secrets of the musical mind as its most musical . Brahms was a subscriber to the editions of both the big Handel and the big Bach Societies . When a new volume of the former arrived , he would turn the pages and say This is very interesting ; I must go through it as soon as possible . ' But when a Bach volume arrived he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he had studied it through and through . The story serves as a good illustration of the attitude of the profounder musical mind everywhere and in all epochs towards the two giants ; Wagner , again , in his last years , constantly played Bach or had Bach played to him . We go to the two men for two quite different things ; but for all the beauty , the splendour , the grandeur , the humanity that endear Handel to us , it is Bach who holds us with a spell the potency of which increases with the years .  | DELIUS AND THE OPERA : A QUEST FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE ? 29th September 1935 AT Covent Garden last Monday , during the intervals and at the end of the performance , everyone was saying that Koanga ' was undramatic and that Delius had little talent for opera . The general truth of these propositions can not be disputed . Everything in Delius 's musical make-up that made him what he was , with all his qualities and all his defects , ran counter to the ordinary conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there in Sea Drift ' , in the Mass of Life ' , and in certain other works he has given us some of the most moving interpenetrations of words and music that the history of the art can show , it remains true that , speaking generally , he had virtually no feeling for words . Again and again , in work after work , he sets the teeth of the sensitive listener on edge with his awkward handling of words . It will be said , of course , in some quarters , that where music is concerned the words do not greatly matter . The answer to that easy-going proposition is that there is no law to compel a composer to take words as the starting-point and the inspiration of his music , but that if he chooses to do so he will naturally be expected to observe certain rules of the game . If he persistently shapes his phrases in such a way that the accents and the rhythms and the rise and fall of his music run counter to the very life of the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimace to the face of his hearers . Delius 's well-known mannerisms as a musician are particularly unpropitious for the setting of words . A glance at random at almost any page of Koanga ' will show the backbone of the verbal phrases being broken or weakened by the persistent bias of the composer 's mind towards certain fixed formulae of musical accent , rhythm , harmony , and contour . No other composer has ever declaimed ' so badly as Delius : rarely can a sentence that has been set to music by him be sung as one  | would speak it . The music imposes its own accent , rhythm , and articulation upon it ; and as these , as everyone recognises , are somewhat standardised in Delius , the result is that not only are the words themselves mishandled , but there emerges next to nothing of the variety of impression that character in action ought to give us on the stage . In Koanga ' , for instance , not only do all the characters talk very much alike , but the same character expresses himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is useless to reply that all Wagnerian characters speak Wagner 's special idiom , all Mozartian or Straussian characters an idiom that is unmistakably Mozart or Strauss . That must be granted : but the fact remains that within the limitations of a style marked out for them by their own personalities these composers do succeed in making one stage character sound different from another . Delius does not succeed in doing so . His lack of a sense of the theatre is shown in various other ways . He was so uncritical of the words he was setting that he seems to have accepted anything that a librettist put before him . It never occurred to him that his music would be handicapped from the commencement by the characters talking as they would never talk in life or in literature worthy of the name , but only in the jargon that was thought to be de rigueur in opera a generation or two ago . We do not know , of course , to what extent the just-published text of Koanga ' has been revised ' by other hands : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point we must assume that Delius really thought , in company with his librettist , that negro slaves on an American cotton plantation would say , The dawn begins to gild the East . Each cabin door opens to greet the strident ( sic ) call . The world resumes again its old unchanging round ' , and so on : or again , when they have been awakened from sleep a second time , Once again the weary sun ascends from pallid ocean bed . ' Nor would any composer with a sense of the theatre , dealing with a subject from real life in which the only clue to the psychological motivation of the characters is what they say about themselves and each other , set half-a-dozen people singing different things at the same time in different rhythms , with the result that all we hear is a web of rich sound with no definite meaning .  | The cases of the quintet in the Meistersinger ' and the trio in the Rosenkavalier ' are not on all fours with this general procedure of Delius . The really dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he departs from the plain commonsense rule in these matters : he does so deliberately , in order to bring the action and the psychology to a momentary head , and the overriding result justifies him , even in the theatre . The trouble with Delius is , in the first place , that these departures from dramatic verisimilitude are the outcome not of a superior musical-dramatic sense but of the total lack of that sense , and in the second place that , never having been able to visualise in his study the totality of the thing as it would reveal itself on the stage , he sometimes lands himself in a situation that is not merely non-dramatic but downright comic . The cardinal example of this is the episode in which Palmyra , Clotilda , Perez , Koanga , Martinez , and a four-part chorus of negroes in the fields ? plus , of course , the orchestra ? unite in an ensemble in which each of the principal characters is given words of his own that are intended to reveal his own motives and reactions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single word of what they are saying , but when the soloists suddenly lapse into silence we hear the negroes informing us ? as if this had been the essence of the whole matter ? that Now we may put scythe and sickle away , for the dinnerbell is ringing ! ' Delius 's congenital helplessness in stage matters is shown in various other ways . Koanga ' is too long for a short opera and too short for a long one : consequently as the audience has to be given the feeling that it is getting its money 's worth in the shape of a full evening 's entertainment , the time has to be spun out with extraneous orchestral matter ( presumably from other works of his ) ; which has the double effect of thinning out the tenuous stage action still further and of making the audience feel at the end that some of the music it liked best had nothing to do with the drama . To make out a general case against Delius as a dramatist , then , is easy . But when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have perhaps only touched the surface of the matter . A more sympathetic and perhaps more discerning view of it all  | would be that Delius 's failure is due to his having been reaching out all his life to a new dramatic form germane to his genius , without ever succeeding in discovering quite what that form would have to be . Ordinary dramatic expression of character or painting of situation was in the main beyond him : in his art , as in his life , he was much too self-centred for that . But in his own way he certainly had an interest in character and situation ; and the problem for him was to find a dramatic , or quasidramatic , form that would enable him to deal with these in his own peculiar way . By the very build of his brain he was incapacitated from attaining much variety of musical idiom , though he could give an astonishing number of facets to the idiom that was personal to him . He could never get outside himself , never project himself , as the more objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like nature , had always to be shown as he appeared to Delius . He is therefore in his real element in drama only when he can talk in propria persona about a vital matter instead of making the protagonists speak for themselves . The best thing in The Village Romeo and Juliet ' is that exquisite intermezzo in which Delius shows us his young lovers not in action but as a pretext for his own tender and pitiful musing upon them . In Koanga ' he begins with a prologue and ends with an epilogue in which Uncle Joe and his listeners first talk of the drama-to-come and then reflect upon it . That this is bad theatre ' we all admit : but it is good Delius . He may not be able to show us Koanga and Palmyra convincingly upon the stage : but when he himself pours out upon them and us the flood of his sensitive brooding upon them we feel that purification of the soul by pity which was , of course , his real purpose in taking up this drama , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own way , not in the ordinary way of the theatre . He found , for once , something like the material and the form that enabled him to express himself dramatically in his own way ? in his Fennimore and Gerda ' . Here the action of Jacobsen 's novel ( ' Niels Lhyne ' ) is cast into eleven short scenes , each lasting no more than a few minutes . Economic and other conditions of the theatre make the work practically  | impossible , of course . If , however , it could be given in a production in the half-mystical style suited to it , it would produce an extraordinary effect ? at any rate on an audience of philosophers and poets . For here , at last , Delius found a form that allowed him to describe the inner drama of souls in his own way , a way that allowed him to accompany the characters in person , by means of his music ( especially of his orchestral interludes ) , in each of the decisive episodes of their career . One finally comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards a new type of musical drama , but that the problems with which it confronted him were beyond the capacity either of his librettists , his own genius , or the conventional theatre to solve  | ITS ENGLISH HISTORY 29th August 1937 THERE is no longer any reason to complain that Sibelius is neglected ' in this country . The Promenade Concerts have always been a sure indication of the composers in whom the plain musical man has been most interested at any given moment ; and not only do this year 's programmes include each of Sibelius 's seven symphonies , together with the violin concerto and several of the tone poems , but last Thursday , for , I believe , the first time in Promenade history , Sibelius had the whole concert to himself . Really to himself ; for whereas the so-called Wagner or Beethoven or Brahms or Bach evenings are diluted , at any rate in the second half , by the works of all and sundry , on Thursday Sibelius had the field to himself from first to last with the Festivo ' from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fourth ) , the violin concerto , The Swan of Tuonela ' , and The Return of Lemminkainen ' . The truth is , however , that while Sibelius 's vogue has grown rapidly during the last ten years he was never , all things considered , neglected ' in England . Sir Henry Wood in London , and Sir Granville Bantock in Liverpool and Birmingham , were giving what were then his newest works a good thirty years ago ; the first symphony , in fact , figured in a Promenade concert programme of 1903 . Mrs Rosa Newmarch 's informative booklet on him dates from about 1906 . By 1907 Sibelius was so conscious of owing much to his English enthusiasts that he dedicated the score of his third symphony , which was finished about that time , to Sir Granville Bantock . The fourth symphony , finished in 1911 , had a place of honour in the Birmingham Festival conducted by Sir Henry Wood in October , 1912 ; and the publishers were sufficiently confident of the interest that would be taken in it to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dealing in considerable detail with the composer in general and the new work in particular . The novelty  | of idiom and above all the terseness of expression in the No. 4 necessarily gave our musical public something to think about ; and then before either Sibelius could come forward with another major work or people could finish the digestion of the first four symphonies and some of the tone poems ? all of which had been presented to them within some nine years ? the war broke out . It was some years before music quite got on its feet again in this country , and some further years before public opinion could steady itself after the wild theorising of the first post-war period ; so that it was not until 192I that London heard the fifth symphony . But Sibelius had now virtually to begin over again in England ; and a few more years were required to establish him securely with a new generation of concert-goers . Conductors soon found that the first and second symphonies were not only easy to give but decidedly effect-making with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not only good music but good policy , they began to compete with each other in their attempts to be first with the Sibelius news . He quickly became a concert best-seller : the fifth , sixth , and seventh symphonies , Tapiola ' and other works of his later period were given with reasonable frequency , considering the congested conditions of our concert life . The one major work of his that hung fire was the violin concerto , which , in its first form , dates from as long ago as 1903 . ( It was revised in 1905 . ) The responsibility for this neglect rested not with the public or the conductors but the star violinists , the majority of whom , for all the service they have been to the cause of contemporary music , might just as well have never been born . It was left to the musicians among the fiddlers , not to the stars , to discover the concerto . I myself heard it for the first time some ten years ago in Paris , when the solo part was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall type that I regret to say I can not now remember his name . I believe it was Arthur Catterall who floated the concerto in this country . The trail thus having been blazed , the stars are now beginning to find that the work is worth their attention . There can be no doubt that the cause of the temporary setback in Sibelius 's vogue was the coming of the war fast upon the heels of the production of the fourth symphony . That work  | was so different from any other of its type that it would have required , round about 1912 , frequent hearings to familiarise listeners with what were at that time regarded as its startling novelties of idea and form ; and frequent performances were of course made impossible by the war . The approach to the No. 4 would have been easier for the general public by way of the No. 5 ( 1915 ) ; but , as I have said , this was not given here until 1921 . More frequent performances of Nos . I , 2 , and 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for there is really nothing in this that is not implicit , in one way or another , in the other symphonies , even down to the seventh . But in 1912 the No. 4 was rather a tough nut for the English to crack , partly because of its purely Finnish and Sibelian mentality . I remember that at one of the Birmingham rehearsals of the work a man whom I did not know seated himself beside me and looked curiously at my score , apparently in the hope that the evidence of his eyes might help to supply the understanding that had escaped him on the evidence of his ears alone . When the rehearsal was over he said to me , Queer stuff , is n't it ? ' I tried to point out to him that his difficulty , which I was sure would only be a temporary one , was that this music came from a different national- and culture-heredity from ours : it comes from Finland ' , I explained . Ah ! ' he said , with the air of one on whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coom from Halifax myself . ' Since that epoch , thanks entirely to Sibelius , the distance separating Halifax from Helsingfors has been appreciably diminished . The No. 4 no longer has any terrors for even a popular ' audience , for the first three symphonies on the one hand , and the last three on the other , have given every intelligent listener the clue to it . Sibelius does virtually nothing in the No. 4 that he does not do , in almost precisely the same terms , at the equivalent point in each of his major works . I have more than once hinted , in this column , that the essence of each composer 's general procedure can be reduced , by analysis , to a few simple formulae : the constitutional bias of his mind makes him do practically the same thing again and again when he is confronted by much the same general idea to be expressed or much the same design to be built up . Composers , I find , are curiously  | sensitive about this matter when you begin to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others tighten their lips and take refuge in a dignified silence : apparently they think that if the thesis can be proved it will reduce them to the level of machines . As to the fact , however , there can be no dispute ; the only difficulty in the way of establishing it to every reader 's satisfaction is that in the case of each composer the demonstration would mean the quotation of some hundreds of musical examples . It is no use our pointing out to those of our personal friends who write music that , on the one hand , what is true of them is equally true of all the greatest classics ? Beethoven in particular ; and that on the other hand the same basic procedure is capable of so many modifications , and such subtle modifications , in practice that the ordinary music lover can listen to the great composers all his life without for a moment suspecting the subconscious operation in them of the law to which I have referred . Our friends , as I know from personal experience , are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found most constant , without knowing it , to a few fundamental formulae are Beethoven and Sibelius ; and once you know the Sibelian formulae you have the main explanation of why the No. 4 was found rather baffling twenty-five years ago . Something in the constitution of his mind or in his spiritual experience just then impelled him to a titanic effort of concentration : the result was that at one point after another he either cut out altogether what would elsewhere have been preparatory matter or considerably curtailed it . I have space here for only one illustration . He is very fond of a procedure which , borrowing a term from the engraver 's art , one might call cross-hatching ? in music , an extensive repetition of rapid figures about one or more fixed points . The auditory effect , as I have implied , is very much the equivalent of the visual effect of cross-hatching . But when we come to ask ourselves the reason for this procedure we have to resort to another image ? that of the propeller . Beethoven has a not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat a little figure until by sheer repetition it has generated the energy he requires to launch his big motive . ( The reader will find an example of this in the Egmont ' overture , bars  | I25-134 counting backward from the final allegro con brio : to vary the simile once more , Beethoven needs a long run up to the wicket and several preliminary hand-flourishes before he can fling the ball ? in this case his great main theme ) . Sibelius 's cross-hatching serves a similar purpose . It helps him to get up steam , as it were : out of this whirl of notes there comes in due time the big tune or the massive brass chords , much as the big ship gets fairly going after some beating about with its propellers . It is a point of manner that occasionally comes dangerously near mannerism ; and it is not unlikely that when his music becomes thoroughly familiar to the ordinary listener the mannerism will in some places constitute a weak spot . It is part and parcel , however , of Sibelius 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well the same place for precisely the same purpose in one work after another . He puts it to varied and sometimes magnificent uses ; but there are also indications here and there that he has consciously tried to rid himself of its tyranny over his mind , and in his greatest symphony , the No. 7 , he gives us only occasional hints of it . In the No. 3 it is very prominent , less so in the No. 5 , markedly so in the No. 6 . In the No. 4 he seems to have made a convulsive effort to dispense with it , to evolve and link up his really vital material without its aid ; and it is because here he so often lays one great stone directly upon another without the customary cement that the No. 4 makes demands upon the listener 's concentration which the first hearers of it found rather excessive . In one or two places in the No. 4 , on the other hand , he is apt to confuse or disappoint the ordinary hearer by indulging for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big tune that normally follows it and is the justification of it . In the first movement , for instance , a long preparation-piece of the kind I have described begins at Letter E of the score . It culminates , at Letter I , in one of those splendid lion-roars in the brass that are characteristic of Sibelius . But here he does not go on to his big tune as he almost invariably does elsewhere ? in the finale of the No. 5 , for example , where , after a long and increasing tension of very much the same type as that of the point just mentioned in the No. 4 , he lets the engines out for all they are worth and sails grandly into  | the open sea . In the No. 4 he does not carry on in this way , but , after a second brass eruption , brings the movement to an end with less than twenty quiet bars . The procedure justifies itself , taking into consideration the movement as a whole ; but undoubtedly the casual listener , especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels that his expectation of something huge to come out of so much propeller work has been defeated . The No. 4 , in fact , is of exceptional interest to the Sibelian student now in the light thrown on it by the No. 7 and Tapiola ' , where at last the composer attains , in a single movement , the drastic concentration at which he had been aiming in the earlier work . THE MOST PATHETIC SYMPHONY : TCHAIKOVSKY AND THE CONDUCTORS 3rd October 1937 THE announcement of Tchaikovsky 's Pathetic Symphony in the programme of a Promenade Concert the other evening was a reminder of how seldom we hear that work nowadays . Some of us can still remember the sensation it caused at its first appearance . It was new in so many ways , both in form and in expression . A symphony that ended with a slow movement was a novelty : while the five-four movement created much the kind of excitement that the Indians must have felt when white ? or relatively white ? men first appeared on the shores of America . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement for its own sake , so preoccupied were they with the new and baffling problem of counting five : all round the concert hall could be seen men and women resolutely ticking off one , two , three , four , five : one , two , three , four , five , on one hand with the fingers of another ; getting into difficulties and finding their fingers becoming all thumbs as soon as what seemed to be a strong beat came on the second note of the bar , instead of on the first as they had expected ; hastily substituting the thumb for the first finger ; discovering a couple of bars later that their counting was all wrong ; and finally giving up the stupendous problem in despair . Among the younger and more mathematically minded enthusiasts there would be heated debates next day as to whether the five was two plus three or three plus two , or one plus four or four plus one , or , as another school of thought maintained , just plain five . Under the unaccustomed strain more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem was localised until it could be pretty well mastered : if , on top of the Tchaikovsky five-four , our audiences had been confronted just then with the eleven-four chorus in Rimsky-Korsakov 's Sadko ' , the lunatic asylums of this country would have burst their walls .  | It was not the five-four movement , however , that accounted for the attraction of the Pathetic ' at that time . Towards that movement people mostly felt very much as the little boy in Arnold Bennett 's story did in front of the painting of a lion in its cage : he used , it will be remembered , to come as near as he dared to touching the bars of the cage , more than half fearful that the lion would bite him . The five-four in any other world would probably have repelled as much as it attracted . What gave the Pathetic its enormous vogue was first of all the passion of pessimism that filled the first movement and the last . This was something new in music . Moreover , the composer had not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the symphony ? an admirable strategic stroke on the part of any composer who wants popularity ? but the word had gone round that he had committed suicide . The symphony was therefore a human document ' . Even its title , The Pathetic ' , was an asset . Then the long tragicomedy of the work began : it was soon to become pathetic in a way of which its composer had never dreamed . Writers with a vast knowledge of music made the remarkable discovery that its opening theme : was very like that of Beethoven 's Pathetic ' sonata : The reminiscence-hounds bayed as only they among canines can bay : what they overlooked was the simple fact that the supposed reminiscence was no reminiscence at all , but merely one more use of a grief-motive that is very common in modern  | music . It will be seen , for instance , at A in the following quotation from Tannhauser 's Pilgrimage : Wagner 's works , indeed , from the youthful F sharp minor piano Fantasia onwards , are full of it in its simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the germ-idea , again , of the first of Brahms 's Four Serious Songs . How completely the figure had taken possession of Tchaikovsky 's imagination is shown incidentally by the way it reappears in an inner part in the second subject : Tchaikovsky , in fact , being a very natural composer , who wrote just as he felt , had unconsciously packed his symphony with this and other natural ' expressions of grief ? the wailing descending theme , for instance . ( The music of the last two or three hundred years is largely based on these natural ' motives ; a card index of them could easily be compiled and would be very instructive ) And not only had he done this but he had marked his score with an amount of detail that showed how interested he was in what he was saying , and how much importance he attached to the message ' of his music being made clear to the listener . ( See , for example , how many marks of expression he has crowded into the few bars of No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his anxiety were his undoing . The strange fauna of star ' conductors swooped on to the symphony like beasts of prey . It did not seem to strike more than one or two of them that what the symphony has to say is all contained in the music itself : they must needs overtrump every one of Tchaikovsky 's trumps , dot all his i 's , double-cross all his t's.  | They plunged themselves , the work , and their audiences into a bath of blood and tears ; never since the death of poor Cock Robin had there been such a sighin ' and a sobbin ' . The end of it all might have been foreseen . The conductors disgusted sober people with the work ; for the plain man , who does not read scores for himself , naturally assumed that all the sentimentality and vulgarity that the conductors put into the symphony were in the symphony itself . The Pathetic gradually became one of the bad jokes of the musical world , till finally those of us who knew it to be a masterpiece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it again if we could help it , but just to study it for ourselves in the quiet of our homes . In proportion as the memory of our dreadful experiences in the concert room faded we were able to see the thing as its creator had conceived it . One of these days , perhaps , we shall hear it again precisely as it is written , without any of the changes of tempo and expression the majority of conductors inflict upon it or the grossness of their own sentiment which they read into it . Before many weeks are out I propose to suggest a plain and simple way by which those members of an audience who know a great work as it is , and who resent the humiliations it generally receives at the hands of conductors who are bent only on personal exhibitionism , can make their influence felt during the actual performance . I am going to suggest the formation of an S.P.C.C. , and shall ask for the co-operation of all the younger people who really care about music . How necessary a Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of almost any performance we used to hear of the Pathetic . Take , for instance , the case of the five-four movement . As the reader will remember , this falls into two main groups . The chief theme ( A ) is first of all stated at length in the major . Then comes a contrasting theme ( B ) in the minor . Towards the end of the development of this wailing theme Tchaikovsky begins to work into the tissue of it hints of A ; till at last A takes full possession once more . It was the almost invariable practice of conductors to slow down , for expression 's ' sake , the tempo of B , sometimes to almost half the pace of A , regardless of the plain fact that Tchaikovsky intended both sections of the  | movement to proceed in the same tempo . The tempo marking at the commencement of the movement ( allegro con grazia , crotchet 144 ) obviously applied to the whole of it , for there is not a single indication of any change in this respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other marking in the movement is con dolcezza e flebile ' at the head of B , and this is not in any sense whatever a tempo indication : it merely means sweetly and mournfully ' . The result of the slowing down of section B was in the first place that the music here acquired a gross sentimentality that is really alien to it , and in the second place that when at last A is resumed the tempo had to be suddenly and irrationally quickened to something like twice the immediately preceding one . This is merely one illustration of what , with many conductors , went on all through the symphony . But hope springs eternal in the human breast , and I am still optimistic enough to believe that one of these days I shall hear the Pathetic as it really is . But until I can be sure of that I shall prefer reading it to listening to it , either in the concert room or on gramophone records .  | BLOCH 'S SACRED SERVICE ' : A WORK JEWISH AT HEART 3rd April 1938 ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English performance of Ernest Bloch 's Sacred Service ' . The broadcast was barbarously terminated by a fade-out some minutes before the end ; but by that time listeners had had an opportunity to sample the fine quality of this work , which has always held a high place in the esteem of students of Bloch . It was written between 1932 and 1934 , after the composer 's return to Europe from a long residence in America ; it dates , therefore , from that period of his brooding upon the present sorry condition of the world that gave birth also to the piano sonata ( 1935 ) . For some reason or other both the full score and the piano score were published by an Italian firm ? Carisch , of Milan . The former contains only Hebrew words ; the latter has , in addition to the Hebrew , an Italian version from which it is clear that the texts employed are Old Testament ones familar to us all . ( I understand that there is now an edition with English words , published by Boosey and Hawkes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , the words of the officiating minister at one point ? ' May the time not be distant , 0 God , when Thy name shall be worshipped in all the earth ' , etc. ? though in Italian , like the rest of the Service , in the Carisch vocal score , are given in English in the full score . ) I am rather surprised to hear that there have been numerous performances of the Service in America and on the Continent , not only in the concert room but also in the synagogues . I know nothing of the synagogue , but I should have thought the Service was planned on too big a scale for performance there , calling as it does for an orchestra of thirty-five strings , full wood wind , four horns , three trumpets , three trombones , tuba , two harps , celesta , and a considerable quantity of percussion . For the rest , it requires a solo baritone ( the Cantor ) , and a mixed choir .  | The Birmingham performance was conducted by G. D. Cunningham . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy Henderson . The choral part did not come over very well , perhaps because of some defect in the transmission . The work calls for a large choir with a special kind of technique . It would well repay intensive study by one of our large London Choirs , and the sooner we hear it at Queen 's Hall the better , for it is a remarkable creation . The composer has told us that while it relates primarily to the Jewish Sabbath morning service it is meant to be of universal appeal . It has to be listened to with minds from which all associations with Christian structures such as the Mass have been temporarily banished . The Catholic Mass is a skilful piece of dramatic construction , providing liberal contrasts and telling climaxes . There is nothing dramatic about the Sacred Service ; this is mainly contemplative and philosophical , though of course there are high lights as well as low . For Jewish listeners the work no doubt has a communal significance at many points : but for the rest of us its interest resides mainly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several leading motives , the one most frequently used being the short Mixolydian phrase ( the scale of G to G with F natural ) with which the Service opens ; the simplicity of this allows of it being adapted to all kinds of purposes , harmonic , contrapuntal and rhythmic . The specifically Jewish elements in the music are comparatively rare : we meet with an occasional Oriental melisma or a harmonic complex with other fundamental associations than those of the usual modern European scale , but nowhere do these exoticisms ' clash with the general Western ' texture of the music . Manifestly , however , even when working along apparently traditional lines , the imagination at the back of it all is specifically Blochian ; the choral writing in particular has a stamp of its own . Universal as I believe the appeal of the work to be , it is of course Jewish at heart : Bloch may mourn the sufferings that the modern world has brought on itself by its blindness and its cruelty , but he obviously suffers in the first place as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred and division shall have made way for human brotherhood is universal in its  | scope , but even for the non-Jewish listener what gives this music its peculiarly moving quality is the cry throughout it all of a sorely persecuted race . The most tragic feature of the Service , for me , is the evident inner clash between Bloch 's mind and his heart . There are many occasions on which the words say one thing and the music , it seems to me , another , as if doubt and despair were always weighing down the wings of hope . Take , by way of illustration , the unison choral cry , in the first section , of Hearken , 0 Israel ; the Lord our God is One ' , a cry that is repeated in the third section , and again near the end of the work . Is it in accents such as these that a community expresses its sure conviction ? In each case the phrase terminates in a wild orchestral dissonance : in the second instance the dissonances culminate in a heartrending orchestral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same procedure occurs after the words The Lord shall reign to all eternity ' ; not only do G 's and F sharps tug against each other in the voices , but as soon as these have ceased the full orchestra gives out a tearing minor ninth as a prelude to a short interlude that is agonised from start to finish . As I have said , it is as if the composer , in his heart of hearts , had little belief in his own words of faith and hope . I know no other religious music that presents us with an intellectual and emotional dilemma of this strange kind . The Service has to be listened to at every point in the way appropriate to itself , not in the way to which the settings of the same or similar words by Christian composers have accustomed us . The exaltation that comes of religious confidence is nowhere to be found in this work of Bloch 's . Listen , for example , to Handel 's setting , in the Messiah , ' of Lift up your heads , 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , ' and then to Bloch 's . There is nothing in the latter 's setting of this passage of the triumphal assurance , the pictorial pageantry , of the Christian treatment of the words . Whether the musical phrases he employs are traditional to the Jewish service or not I can not say : be that as it may , the fact remains that the dominant mood is one not of exultation , or even of exaltation , but , in some curious fashion , of difficulty to be faced . In this ritual there is no sense of victory . Recall Handel 's ebullient setting of the  | words that follow ? ' Who is the King of Glory ? The Lord strong and mighty , the Lord mighty in battle ' ? and then observe how Bloch treats them . To the question of the chorus the Cantor answers Adonai Sabaoth , He is the King of Glory . ' The Adonai Sabaoth ' is indeed marked fieramente , but there is no elaboration of that mood , which , indeed , subsides instantly into a dolce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : this is followed by a softly-breathed Selah , selah ' by the choir , and this by an orchestral interlude of quiet intensity ? or intense quietude ? as the Scroll is taken out of the ark . Bloch 's whole treatment of the Bible texts is interesting for its complete difference from the methods we are accustomed to . The expression he puts into them is equally new : that it is largely racial as well as personal is evident from the fact that in the final pages of the work the musical idiom , which , for all its closeness of touch with traditional Jewish elements , has hitherto been that of modern music in general , now becomes more specifically racial . All in all the Sacred Service ' is a remarkable creation , significant not only for the light it throws on Bloch as a musician but also for the light it throws on a grievously tried people . Now that sympathy for the Jews has risen to such heights in this country , a large-scale performance of the Service in London would be not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human fellowship .  | 21st January 1940 JUST before the war broke out I had occasion to refer to a new book by the leading German Nietzschean , Professor Alfred Baeumler , Studien zur deutschen Geistesgeschichte . A few days ago I happened to be reading the letters of Holderlin , a fine poet and singularly attractive personality , a contemporary of Goethe and Schiller , whose work is too little known to the generality of English readers . Recalling Professor Baeumler 's remarks on Holderlin in his essay on Hellas and Germanien ' I took up his book again , and once more was mightily impressed by his confident exposition of the thesis that the modern Germans are the true heirs of Greek culture . That thesis has been a favourite one with German writers for many years : it is merely one more exemplification of that engaging modesty that compels the Germans to admit the truth about themselves , even when it appears to verge almost on flattery . One 's only regret is that the ancient Greeks were not aware of the spiritual family reunion they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us in other and more barbarian countries , also , there would be a thrill in hearing Plato call Dr. Goebbels brother , and seeing Epicurus clasp the lilywhite hand of Herr Himmler . While musing wistfully upon this lofty subject I discovered that from somewhere or other the B.B.C. was just about to broadcast a performance of Brahms 's Song of Destiny ' . The words of this are by Holderlin , and good Brahmsians have always assured us that the music represents the composer 's closest approach to the Greek spirit . After the performance of the Song of Destiny ' , which has long been a great favourite of mine , I read through the scores of certain others of those smaller works of Brahms for voices and orchestra that are so unaccountably neglected in England , though they contain some of his finest music . The Alto Rhapsody ' ( words by Goethe ) does not concern me here ; for the moment I am concerned only with the three works in which the German-'Greek ' spirit finds  | expression in the poems ? the Song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( words from Goethe 's Iphigenie ' ) and the Name ' ( words by Schiller ) . Looking at these scores again , after the lapse of some years , I had to confess that I could no longer find in them the Greek ' quality I had been taught to see in them . This music , if Professor Baeumler will forgive me for saying so , is mostly far too German to be very Greek : it is too thick about the waist and too heavy on its feet for that . Nor can I any longer subscribe to a dogma we all dutifully took for granted at one time ? that in the final orchestral section of the Song of Destiny ' Brahms intended to console us for the pessimism he and the poet had poured out on us in the preceding section . The reader will no doubt remember that the poem is in three stanzas , in the first two of which Holderlin paints the felicity of the immortals in their abode of beauty and light , while the third stanza depicts the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former picture in an orchestral prelude and a chorus of tranquil loveliness , and the second in a chorus of drastic harshness of expression . Then , according to the theory accepted , unable to bear the thought of leaving us in this hopeless pagan ' mood , he consoles us ? some pious writers even speak of Christian consolation ' ? with a repeat of the orchestral prelude , which brings the fine work to an exquisite end . It is perhaps possible , however , to explain Brahms 's procedure more simply , in terms not of philosophy but of rudimentary musical form . Of the three Greek ' poems , two , the Schicksalslied ' and the Gesang der Parzen ' , confront the musician with peculiar formal difficulties . The Nanie ' was easy enough ; the overriding uniformity of its moods enabled Brahms to round off the musical close by a simple return to the opening strain . But over the Gesang der Parzen ' Brahms broke down completely . His setting of Goethe 's fifth stanza is truly nonsensical ; his suave music ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? flies in the very face of the pitiless sentiment of the words . It is useless to try , as some apologists have done , to explain away this wrong procedure on pseudo-philosophical lines . The plain fact is that Brahms solved , to his own satisfaction if not ours , his problem of form here as he does more than once in his songs ,  | arbitrarily imposing a certain procedure of musical contrast upon the words at a particular point of a poem , whether that be the most rational psychological point for such a change or not . In the case of the Gesang der Parzen ' , the quite irrational softening of the music in the stanza Es wenden die Herrscher ' was dictated purely and simply by the feeling Brahms had that some musical variety was desirable before he wound up his work by a return to the uncompromising hardness of the opening ; and he merely obeyed a general law of his subconscious self as an artist in inserting this musical variety just where he was accustomed to do , regardless of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as postlude , of the beautiful orchestral prelude of the Schicksalslied ' came about purely and simply because there was nothing else open to Brahms by way of ending . The two antithetical choral sections are perfect individually , but from the point of view of musical form they are incomplete . Brahms , as we know , thought at one time of a choral ending with a repeat of the opening words of the poem . He did at once the obvious and supremely sensible thing by rounding his work off in simple A B A form by repeating the instrumental prelude . There is no need to talk , as one orthodox old-school Brahmsian does , of Brahms thus conveying to us that he had more confidence in a future life than the poet expressed ' .  | 28th January 1940 As I expected , my article last week on the Song of Destiny ' and certain other choral-orchestral works of Brahms has brought me some correspondence . Most of it is concerned with the interpretation to be put upon the employment of the orchestral prelude to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend suggests that there may be another explanation of this besides the simple impulse on the composer 's part to round off his work by a resort to A B A form . She asks whether the repetition of the lovely first theme may not be meant to symbolise the indifference of the gods ? While poor mankind is hurtling blindly down into the abyss , they go on wandelnd droben im Licht auf weichem Boden ' , etc . The pagan gods , when not interfering in human affairs from the lowest and pettiest of motives , were as indifferent as Nature . And the Great Mind ? God , or Fate , or Anangke , or whatever we may call it ? is as beautifully indifferent too . So there need be no inconsistency in reminding us of the happy gods . It only makes our own fate more painful by contrast . ' With this I fully agree . But I submit that it constitutes a secondary problem for the primary one . If we ask ourselves what Brahms could have done , by way of rounding off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are compelled to reply , Nothing . The orchestral repeat was rooted in the very nature of things . That is what I call the primary problem . The secondary problem is what philosophical connotations were set up in Brahms 's own mind by the repeat . In my article I was concerned only to question the validity of the traditional explanation of the repeat ? that after the stark pessimism of Holderlin 's last verse Brahms wanted to administer a little Christian consolation ' to us by repeating the serene music of the prelude . Just what Brahms thought about this matter we ( lo not know ; but for the rest of us surely the effect of the postlude is precisely that described by my friend ? the repetition of the picture of the bliss of the gods does not correct ' the pessimism of the final verse but gives an extra sadness to it .  | While I am on this subject there are one or two points that call for a little more discussion than I had space for last week . I myself can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Schicksalslied ' , the Gesang der Parzen ' , and the Nanie ' . I could not define very exactly what I and others have in mind when we speak of Greek ' in this connection ; and I myself would prefer to use the term Mediterranean ' , meaning by that a texture , and beyond that a spirit , woven of finer strands and vibrating with a purer , warmer light than is the general lot of man in more northern countries . I can see nothing of this in Brahms even at his most ' Greek ' : the texture of his mind and of his speech is still the product of a land in which the blood courses more sluggishly than in the favoured south . For expressions of this truly Greek ' spirit , if we are going to agree to call it that , we must look elsewhere than to modern German music ? to some of the music of France , or to the incomparably beautiful flute melody in the scene in the Elysian Fields in Gluck 's Orfeo ' . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prelude and the postlude to the Schicksalslied ' Brahms has achieved a poignancy of beauty that can not be paralleled anywhere else in all his work . We do not need the testimony of his friends to persuade us that Holderlin 's poem moved him as few poems had ever done . One of the reasons for the Schicksalslied ' , the Gesang der Parzen ' and the Nanie ' being more German than Greek ' is that in all of them the rhythm is much more Brahms than H6lderlin , Goethe or Schiller . The choral texture of the works , of course , of itself dictates a certain metrical four-squareness of melodic phrasing , in which the characteristic rhythm of the poems is bound to disappear . But there would have been the same loss in whatever other form Brahms had chosen for his settings . For Brahms could generally be trusted to paralyse the rhythmic nerve of any poem that did not run along the simplest metrical lines . It is not a matter of neglected opportunities of right verbal accent or the sheer musical tyranny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though there are some rather painful instances of this in the works we are discussing , as in many other works of Brahms . More serious than this is his complete failure , obsessed as he so often is by  | melodic-metrical formulae derived from German popular song , to reproduce in his music even the smallest suggestion of that subtle cross-fertilisation of sense and sound that constitutes so much of our pleasure when we read these poems . Even the reader without a close acquaintance with German poetic rhythms will see what I mean if he will get thoroughly into him the lilt of the opening lines of the N " nie ' : Auch das Schone muss sterben ! Das Menschen and Gotter bezwinget , Nicht die eherne Brust riihrt es des stygischen Zeus ; and then take up Brahms 's score and see how he has massacred the rhythm for his own purely musical purposes . So far as my own knowledge of the subject goes , poems couched in the German hexameter form have in general been fought shy of by German song composers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Medtner 's fine settings of two poems by Goethe ? ' Einsamkeit ' and Geweihter Platz . ' And why has Holderlin been so strangely neglected by the German composers ? Can any of my readers tell me whether his noble An die Parzen ' has ever been attempted in music ?  | 27th March 1949 How much longer is the remarkable Wozzeck ' to wait for a stage production in London ? That our public knows anything at all about it is due entirely to the B.B.C. , which gave us a concert performance of it in Queen 's Hall ( that was also broadcast in the Home Service ) , and one in the studio , broadcast in the Third Programme . Everything about Wozzeck ' is amazing . To begin with , Bi chner 's drama . If a manuscript of this had come to light for the first time the other day and been published by the finder of it as the work of a German boy who died in 1837 in his 24th year there would have been the sharpest doubts expressed as to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could thus have anticipated our modern half-mad schizophrenic world in 1836 , and least of all a young German only just out of his teens . An interesting subject for study , by the way , would be the influence of a medical training on some of the musicians and literary men of the early 19th century . Buchner , Flaubert and Berlioz , for example , were all the sons of doctors , studied anatomy , and , in some cases , walked the hospitals ' and practised or witnessed dissection . So did one or two of the characters in Murger 's Scenes de la vie de Boheme ' ; and we have evidence enough that the hospitals and dissecting rooms of that epoch were rather horrible . It is no wonder that sensitive young artists who went through these experiences developed a taste for the cynical gruesome-grotesque which it took them some time to shake off . In Biichner 's case the sense of the crazy precariousness of the balance of the human mind and body was shot with a pity for poor humanity that was none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his case the result of it all was a drama in which hardly one of the chief characters is quite  | normal ; each of them is poised dizzily on a small point on the borderline between sanity and insanity . Could such a subject be re-conceived in music ? Berg decided that it could ; and by an astonishing concurrence of all the necessary factors , some of them personal , others made possible by the new turn that music had taken about the beginning of the present century , he managed to bring it off . No one else could have done it . Obviously the older harmonic idiom and the older routines of opera construction would not suffice for a theme of this kind . To begin with , much of what these characters are saying could not possibly be sung in the ordinary way ; nor could it be simply spoken . So Berg , following the lead of Schonberg , decided , for certain episodes , on the sort of speech melody ' he defines in a foreword to his score . Though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sung as a melody . Nor , on the other hand , are the words to be delivered in the ordinary speaking voice : there must be a compromise between the two procedures . The result is often distressing to the musical ear , though in practice , indeed , some of the performers find their purely musical instincts and habits too strong to be overcome by any effort of the will , and they keep slipping back into the singing ' style which Berg expressly says he does not want . But whether we wholly approve of it or not , there can be no question that Berg was right in this particular instance . Obviously again , the established opera forms would be incongruent with such a drama as Wozzeck ' ; so Berg saw it in terms of a new form . Each of the fifteen scenes that make up the three acts is cast in one of the forms of instrumental music ? sonata form , fugue , passacaglia , and so on . To all this there can be no a priori objection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? witness the death song of Purcell 's Dido . But these are simple matters ; to recognise the rightness of Berg 's choice of a particular form for a particular situation , and to appreciate the combination of craftsmanship and dramatic imagination with which he has handled his material , necessitates much hard work at the score . A great deal of the ingenuity  | of it is bound to pass unnoticed by the ordinary listener . He will presumably spot without any difficulty the fugal subject and answer in the second scene of the second act , but I doubt whether he will be able to follow the whole course of the passacaglia that is the best form that could have been chosen for the expression of the idee fixe of the crazy Doctor in the fourth scene of the first act . This does not mean that Berg was ever wrong in going about his technical-dramatic job the way he did : the trouble is simply that for us to see it all as he saw it involves a great deal of hard intellectual exercise . That notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ' , always the only possible move for a scene , is testimony enough to Berg 's technical skill and imaginative power . We will consider next week some other features of the work , in particular it 's harmonic idiom , which is of more than one kind , but always the right kind for the character or the situation of the moment . 3rd April 1949 I SAID last week that everything about Wozzeck ' is amazing , from Buchner onwards . Berg 's contribution makes the work unique . There is no fear of any later opera composer following in his wake , even if that were wholly desirable ; even more than is the case with Pelleas et Melisande ' , here is something which in its totality had no forerunners and is most unlikely to have any legitimate and healthy successors . Whether you like ' the opera or not , and even if you jib at some of it , you have to admit that the thing , incredible as it would have appeared a priori , has come off , and that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Of all the works bearing the Schonberg seal ? I mean , of course , the  | Schonberg of the period that succeeded the Gurrelieder ' and the Verklarte Nacht ' ? this is the only one that has seized upon the imagination of the ordinary music lover and brought him back to the hearing of it again and again . How has Berg managed it ? Not by virtue of those forms ' , mostly new to opera construction , on the handling of which the analyst loves to dilate . There was no reason whatever why Berg should not use these or any other routines of stylisation if he felt they would further his purpose . Still , forms exist for music 's sake , not music for the form 's sake . Everything depends on what the composer has managed to do with them . Berg himself was perhaps inclined , as Schonberg was and still is , to overvalue the logic of musical procedure in and by and for itself . Schonberg , we learn , used to illustrate the process of theme-transformation in musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneading and twisting it into all sorts of shapes , and then saying , You see , it still remains the same hat . ' But , as I think I have remarked before , all this leaves out of the reckoning the essence of the matter ? the original quality of the material of the hat and the value of it as a piece of apparel , in its various metamorphoses : of what avail is all the ingenuity that has been expended on transforming it if the final product is a hat that no one would care to be seen in in Piccadilly ? Berg too could fall into the quite academic error of supposing that if a musical work is well made it is necessarily good music . A moment 's consideration will convince the least skilled in music that this is a classroom or text-book fallacy . It would be easy , for instance , to construct a symphonic first movement that should be an exact reduplication of the construction of that of the Eroica ; but it would not , on that account , be another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of Schonberg 's D minor string quartet , op. 7 ( 19o7 ) . One follows with the greatest interest his demonstration of the constructional power shown in the quartet ; but we still remain unconvinced , in 1949 , that this is a piece of music of the first order . No , the proof of every pudding is in the eating ; and if the eating is good the ordinary man is not very curious about the proportions of the ingredients or the technique of the cook . So  | Wozzeck ' is aesthetically neither better nor worse for its forms ' ; all that matters in the end is the quality of the music . At home one goes with pleasure through the intellectual exercise of tracing all the threads of the various patterns ; but when listening to Wozzeck ' one forgets or puts aside most of what one has learnt in this way and simply surrenders oneself to the broad musical impression . The non-technical listener , indeed , can do nothing else but this . The thing that matters is that somehow or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berg has brought off the seemingly impossible . What looks like sheer caprice on paper , and is frankly intolerable when the reader of the score hears it mentally in terms of most of the other music to which he is accustomed ? that is to say , music as a blackand-white drawing touched up in colour ? sounds exactly right when heard as Berg intended it to be heard , the colour not being merely laid on a pre-existent design but constituting an integral part of the idea . A simple illustration will serve . What could be more awful in the black-and-white of the piano or a piano score , than a downward slither of some twenty successive minor ninths ? But listen to them in the ghostly pianissimo of two solo violins , with a shuddering bare fourth below them in the violas , playing tremolando on the bridge , and you can have no doubt that here is the perfect , the inevitable realisation , technical and pictorial and psychological , of the grisly horror of the scene in which the distracted Wozzeck searches in the moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie 's murder to him . The non-technical listener to the opera finds himself , perhaps for the first time in his life , taking in a vast amount of non-tonal music and not merely not wincing at it but being engrossed by it . That simple fact is the true measure of Berg 's achievement ; whether the listener can account for his interest or not the fact remains that he is interested in Wozzeck ' throughout , that he feels this music to be not only right ' for the subject but the only musical equivalent conceivable for it . Still , he feels most at home , perhaps , in the last act , of the harmonic idiom of which I will have something to say next week .  | i oth April 1949 How does the plain musical man hear ' Wozzeck ' ; that is to say , how does he fit , or fail to fit , the sounds into the categories of his general musical experience ? We need not spend any time in discussing whether the more repellent portions of the score are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . Let us agree to call them non-tonal , a word which , for practical purposes , will cover both music that discards tonality of set theoretical intention and music which , without any doctrinaire prepossessions , strays at times so far afield from tonality that the ordinary listener feels he has lost his way . It is only by a conscious effort that the average man can think non-tonally for any stretch of time , so rooted is the tonal habit in him . To frankly atonal music he listens with the inherited tonal relationships of notes always at the back of his mind , seizing whenever he can , like a drowning man snatching at a hen-coop , upon a chord that suggests to him a tonal centre ? though the composer never intended it as such ? and regarding the surrounding notes simply as capricious deviations from the norm of harmonic logic . Even those of us who have put in many hours of hard work at the Wozzeck ' score often find a difficulty , during a performance , in thinking our way through the texture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why then does the work grip as it does even the listener without any theoretical training ? I suppose it is because of the unique oneness of the dramatic situations , the psychology of the characters , and the musical expression . The first two of these elements are so consistently irrational that a certain irrationality ( as the ordinary listener conceives it ) in the music also seems right , especially in view of the fact upon which I dwelt last week , that what revolts our harmonic sensibility in black-andwhite can be made not only tolerable but gladly acceptable by means of orchestral colour . But , once more , the acceptance of a divergence into the abnormal implies the background of norm . Everyone knows the electrifying effect of the episode in 5/4 time in the third act of the opera in which Tristan , in his delirium , tears the bandages from his wound . Simple as the  | device of an irregular ' metre is , it serves its end to perfection ? that of suggesting a mind suddenly broken loose from its moorings in sanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing in his opera Orlando ' , and thereby rather upset his formal-minded 18th-century audiences . The whole last scene of this act ' , said Burney , which paints the madness of Orlando , in accompanied recitatives and airs in various measures , is admirable . Handel has endeavoured to describe the hero 's perturbation of intellect by fragments of symphony in 5/8 , a division of time which can only be borne in such a situation . ' In the Wozzeck ' of 1914-20 , as in the Orlando ' of 1733 and the Tristan ' of 1865 , the hearer cheerfully grants the composer his little licences of harmony or rhythm in the portrayal of perturbation of intellect . ' But just as a perturbation of intellect is recognised as such only against a norm of intellectual stability , so does the listener 's acceptance of an abnormal ' harmony depend upon the general recognition of an harmonic norm in these things . We might sum up , perhaps , that while the non-tonal system may have , in the present state of our harmonic development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that it is invalid in others , and Berg himself seems tacitly to admit this in his third act , which , as it happens , always makes the profoundest impression on the audience . It has often been asked whether we can imagine , at any rate just yet , an atonal Romeo and Juliet or Papageno or Desdemona . Anyhow Berg seems to have decided that for the limning of the poor simple humanity of his Marie a nearer approach to tonality would be necessary than in the case of the other main characters . Here he is obviously doing no more than carrying a stage further the chromatic subtilisations of tonality accomplished by Wagner in Tristan ' and Parsifal ' . Often , indeed , the music of this third act is the frankest reminiscence of actual passages in those two works : the episode beginning at bar 323 on page 224 of Wozzeck ' , for instance , suggests how Wagner himself might have handled certain episodes in Parsifal ' had he lived another twenty years or so . Wozzeck ' is a Janus work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the future .  | ON THE FIRST PRODUCTION IN ENGLAND 27th January 1952 As WELL as I could judge , Wozzeck ' last Tuesday made just the effect on its audience that I had anticipated ; whether people liked ' it or not it got hold of them and shook them out of themselves . There are two features of the opera that are calculated to go rather against it at first with the ordinary listener ? the Sprechgesang that endures throughout the greater part of it , and the complex harmonic idiom . To innovations in both these fields Berg was inevitably pre-committed both by the nature of the dramatic subject and by the idiosyncrasies of the dramatist 's style . Buchner never indulges in sentiment , and rarely lets his own emotion be seen . He goes straight to his point , makes it in the fewest words possible , and then leaves it to the reader or the spectator to supply all the emotional reaction that may be required . There is hardly a sentence in the whole play that calls for lyrical or symphonic expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which I shall refer in a moment , the composer has perforce to aim at an objectivity that shall match Buchner 's ; nowhere can the musician speak to us in propria persona , never have the air of saying See how pathetic my characters are in their sufferings and their follies , how sorry I myself am for them , and how sorry I am going to make you too . ' In the second place , a vocal line would have to be found that would not deflect us by age-old associations into emotional connotations of an older kind . To take this last point first . We may as well admit that the vocal line has few amenities for the musical ear , that for the most part it is neither song nor talk , that sometimes it fails even to achieve its declared purpose of reproducing the accents and contours of ordinary speech , and that occasionally it is naively ridiculous . While all this is true , it remains equally true that ii ) r Btichner 's drama and Biichner 's text no other species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He obeyed  | a sound instinct in making the texture of his opera just what it is . It was an experiment in a new genre , and we must not demand final perfection from pioneers ; let us remember that for his new vocal line in particular he had practically no model but Schonberg 's monodrama Erwartung ' , which is in itself a mere first groping in a territory uncharted until then . It may be that a couple of hundred years hence Wozzeck ' will be looked back upon very much as we look back on some of the experiments of Monteverdi and his Italian contemporaries ? as the work of a man of rare genius confronted by the double , the baffling , task of not merely building himself a new house but making his own bricks and having to solve unaided a dozen new problems of material stresses and strains . With the orchestral tissue the plain musical man need not have over-much difficulty . Strange as it often is , it mostly makes the desired effect straight away on the non-technical listener . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goes on at once to the next . Without ever aiming at effect for mere effect 's sake it is always effective . It remains true , however , that the profoundest impression is made on the ordinary listener by the few pages in which the musical idiom avails itself gladly of the resources of the older tonality ? the superb orchestral interlude before the final stage scene . This music tears one 's heart out ; and technically it is simply a further development of the language of Tristan ' and Parsifal . ' Was the resort to this language , as some have thought , a sigh of relief on Berg 's part at being able to escape for a little while from his self-imposed fetters of non-tonality and speak the traditional tongue of music as only he among his younger contemporaries had it in him to do ? Or was the change of tone at this point the last and most convincing proof on his part that his general musical procedure in the opera until then had been right ? , For in these extraordinarily moving pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we had all along been cherishing at least a half-hope that he would do ? he drops his Bi chnerian mask of detachment and pours out his own copious vials of compassion on his pitiful creatures and generous resentment at the constitution of a universe that allows such suffering . He had held all this back until the right moment ? when the  | actual drama was virtually over ; and now he releases a flood of feeling that had long been pent up not only in him but in us . Kleiber 's handling of the performance was , as might have been expected , masterly . The production was in general good , though sometimes more naturalistic than eerie . Of the very capable cast , Marko Rothmuller made the greatest impression with a remarkable Wozzeck . The opera was sung in an English translation by Vida Harford and Eric Blackall . They have done their difficult job extremely well , though one felt at times that the English tongue does not take kindly to the German Sprechgesang.  | THIS SPRECHGESANG ' loth February 1952 I SEEM to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' lately , but the importance and the novelty ( for this country ) of the work have necessitated it . But one feature of the opera has had to go undiscussed ? the vocal line , or at any rate so much of that line as comes under the definition of Sprechgesang . The music-lover who intends to listen to the end to the broadcasts the B.B.C. is now giving us of Schonberg 's music will have to concern himself a good deal , willy-nilly , with that curious modern product . But Wozzeck ' must already be giving the plain musical man much to think about and to make him a trifle uncomfortable ; and perhaps it is as well for him to try to take his bearings in the Sprechgesang now , while Berg 's opera is still accessible to him at Covent Garden . The word has hitherto meant for him simply a dodge , a fake , by which certain Wagnerian singers who could n't sing used to speak their notes at ( approximately ) the pitches noted in the score . But that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stemmed from Schonberg . The Wagnerian Sprechgesang ? sometimes referred to irreverently in days of old as the Bayreuth bark ' ? pretended to be what it was n't , namely , bel canto at a certain remove . The modern Sprechgesang is not a pretence , a fake designed to get a poor technician over a vocal difficulty , but a form of expression used seriously for its own sake . What , then , is it essentially ? If the reader looks up Sprechgesang ' in his German dictionary he will find it defined as recitative ' . But his ears tell him that it is decidedly not recitative in the sense he ordinarily attaches to that word , the sense it carries , for instance , in Don Giovanni ' or Messiah ' , where a portion of the text not calling for or lending itself to formal lyrical outpouring is given the accents , the contours , the pace , the free arhythmic flow of speech but remains , for all that , music , tied to definite notepitches demanding to be sung .  | Now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the composer intended it to be performed or listened to he must approach the vocal line from the correct angle . At present many people appear to be going slightly astray . I have noticed an increasing tendency on the part of some of the singers to sing this Sprechgesang ' passage or that ; it is what they would naturally do , for they have been trained as singers , they regard it as their primary duty to sing , and the sight of words set to notes of definite pitches in the stave almost irresistibly lures them into singing the phrase in the way to which their ordinary musical practice has accustomed them . But this is quite wrong in cases such as those we are now considering . When the singer sings this music in the ordinary way he decoys the listener also into conceiving it as melody of the ordinary kind ; and as such it probably has little to commend it to his musical ear . Hence , I think , the rage of some correspondents who have written to tell me how they hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong way ; not having been given what their musical ear ' had been expecting , they are disappointed and angry . I do n't say whether they are justified or unjustified in this . I merely state a fact , and at the conclusion of the B.B.C. Schonberg broadcasts an opportunity may arise for a more thorough discussion of the problem in all its bearings . Meanwhile , as regards Wozzeck ' , the listener should make himself acquainted with the explanation Berg has given of his procedures in a prefatory note to the score , which follows , for the most part , Schonberg 's preface to his Pierrot Lunaire . ' There are really three forms employed in Wozzeck ' , ( 1 ) plain everyday speech , ( 2 ) near-lyricism , ( 3 ) Sprechgesang proper : in this last , though the notes are written at definite pitches in the score , they are not to be sung in the ordinary way ; they are to be speech yet not realistic-natural speech ? at approximately the musical pitches indicated in the stave . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performer must take particular care not to drop into a singing ' speech-style : that is absolutely not what the composer intends . ' So now the singer knows what to do , and the listener what to expect or not to expect . Or do they ?  | 23rd March 1952 THE B.B.C. is doing us a great service just now by its broadcasts of a comprehensive selection from the works of Schonberg . Of all the works of the real ' Schonberg that might have established themselves by now in our general musical life , the Pierrot Lunaire ' , which was broadcast a few evenings ago , should have stood the best chance , if only because of the small instrumental force it calls for ; but after the performance I found myself asking once more whether that interesting work has still made , or is likely to make , any real progress with the general public . I feel , as I have always done , that what stands , and , I fear , always will stand , in the way of its acceptance is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not get reconciled to this speaking to the note ' , which , as the composer says in his preface to the score , must be neither true speaking ' nor true singing ' , nor even speaking ' at the definite pitches indicated in the score , for it must never suggest to us song . ' The definition , it will be seen , is richer in negative than in positive guidance . Is the problem posed by Schonberg really insoluble in practice as distinguished from theory ? Anyhow he and some of his followers have done us a service by making us uncomfortably conscious that there is a problem ? not a new one , however , but a very old one now assuming a new form . We are up against the eternal question of whether those two inveterate enemies , words and music , can make up their quarrel once and for all , or whether the nearest they can get to a peace treaty is to agree reluctantly on certain mutual accommodations . In the lyric and in opera these accommodations have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , you need my assistance to raise you to your highest emotional potency ' , while words come back with No doubt , but please do n't forget that without my clearer definition of what you are saying in your indefinite language of sound a good deal of it would lack ideal intelligibility , or even an adequate raison d'etre. '  | This more or less grudging agreement , then , works very well up to a certain point . The trouble begins when the composer wishes to avail himself of an extended text that will provide him with all the definition ' he wants without his being under the necessity of creating a vast musical form that will both embrace the poem in its totality and allow full scope for the expression of vital detail . It was for this reason that melodrama ' arose ? the simple speaking of a long text to an illustrative instrumental accompaniment . This method was already cultivated in the eighteenth century ; and I suggest that the B.B.C. might do us a good turn some evening by broadcasting a performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my young days the late Stanley Hawley issued a series of works to which he gave the title of recitation music ' ? for voice and piano ? which also I would commend to the attention of the B.B.C. Schumann made some experiments in this genre , as Strauss ( in his Enoch Arden ' ) and Grieg ( in his Bergliot ' ) have done in our own day . The basic problem of all works of this sort , however , and their bearing on that now confronting us in Schonberg and elsewhere , I must leave for discussion in a further article . Here I want to say a word about a significant feature of one of the most notable of all melodramas , that in the dungeon scene in Fidelio ' , where Leonora and the jailer are digging the grave intended for the prisoner who is Florestan . This is really the nodal point of the opera , the episode in which the dramatic tension reaches its highest point before the coming of the moment of relief . Now Beethoven does not attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his musical net , for the reason among others , no doubt , that this would have meant a good deal of formal elaboration , whereas he wants to concentrate the horror as much as possible . So he finishes with formal music for the time being and resorts to melodrama , as he calls it ? simple everyday speech by Leonora and Rocco , with an occasional expressive pointing ' in the orchestra . We are thus confronted with a paradox of aesthetic . The accepted view of the words-and-music matter is that music steps in when words have reached the limit of their potency '  | ( which is somewhat comically counterbalanced by the Wagnerian theory , a propos of the Ninth Symphony , that in the finale of that work Beethoven had to resort to words because music unassisted could not take the last great step that was needed ) . But in the Fidelio ' case it is pure speech ? not even sung words ! ? that steps in when apparently , in Beethoven 's opinion , music has reached the limit of its own power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said , Now is the time for me to call on music to show what it can do when the dramatic tension has reached its maximum . ' Beethoven gives up the musical struggle and asks for ? and receives in full measure ? all the help that naked speech can give him . Can we now profit in opera by his example ?  | 6th October 1929 I HAVE been favoured lately with a large amount of correspondence ? growing , for the most part , out of some wireless talks ? on the subject of modern harmony . A general agreement on this complicated question is impossible , if only because different people approach it with different backgrounds of harmonic experience ; those of us whose business it is to keep abreast of current music are not in the least startled or estranged by chords that may represent the last word in horror to people who still think in terms of the half-dozen basic chords and their simpler modifications that formed the foundation of music until a few years ago . There may , of course , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a phrase that seems to have caught the fancy of many of my correspondents , I hinted that we professional students and listeners may possibly be in a condition corresponding to that of the boxer who has been hammered so hard that he has ceased even to know that he is being hurt . The technical term for this condition is ' punch-drunk ' ; and it is not at all improbable that a prolonged course of listening to dissonance may make a man dissonance-drunk , so that he loses something of his former sensitiveness to good and bad in harmony . It is a point that has to be taken into consideration . But putting this aside as a subject too big for cursory treatment here , it will be found , I think , that the real source of the difference of reaction of the professional and the layman to some modern works is the fact that the former , through long experience of modern harmony , sees , or fancies he sees , the idea that is at the back of the harmony and is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic of the construction , necessarily misses the connection of ideas . The whole point , then , is whether , given familiarity on the hearer 's part with the language , the composer has really had something to say that was worth saying and whether he has said it clearly and in the best imaginable terms . And there can be little doubt that a good deal of modern music fails to pass this simple test .  | We may take as axiomatic that if the dissonance is an organic part of the idea , the physical ear will not jib at any combination of sounds , however unrelated they may look on paper , while conversely quite a simple dissonance may irritate us if there seems to be no good reason for it in the musical thought . We had many illustrations of this truth the other evening when Strauss 's Don Quixote ' and Arthur Bliss 's Hymn to Apollo ' were given at the same Promenade concert . The Straussian dissonances were accepted by the seasoned listener not only without protest but with aesthetic joy , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea itself was a good one ; whereas some of Mr. Bliss 's dissonances were obviously only plastered upon a texture and an idea that were proceeding placidly along on quite another plane until the composer suddenly remembered that he must do something to show that he is a post-war modern . It was not that these particular dissonances were at all extravagant . As a matter of fact they were quite harmless ; the only trouble with them was that they did not convince us of the musical necessity of their coming just when and where they did . The phenomenon of harmonic pungency for pungency 's sake is not , as some people think , a new one . It already existed in the middle of the nineteenth century ; and Liszt hit off the situation for all time in the remark that cigar ash and sawdust steeped in aqua fortis do not make pleasant soup . ' There is nothing new under the sun ; and what is happening today was long ago analysed by an old gentleman named Richard Wagner , who not only wrote very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about the art . In one of his later essays he pointed out that the operatic composer can permit himself a much wider range of harmony and modulation than the purely instrumental composer can , because in the former case the cause and the justification of a seeming extravagance are made apparent to the listener by the words or the stage action , while in the latter case the departure from the norm has to justify itself by the inner logic of the musical line . Let us apply this simple principle to some recent music . Here is a quotation from one of Stravinsky 's Three Pieces for String Quartet :  | ( The reader must conceive the passage in terms of the strings ; the effect on the piano is very different . The topmost part is played by the viola , and there is a crescendo between the first and second notes of each group , with a sforzando on the second . ) Here is a passage from Petrouchka ' that obviously comes from fundamentally much the same frame of mind : The first passage seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaningless : the second is an eloquent description of the state of mind of poor little Petrouchka , very much perturbed about things in general and fretted by the hopelessness of his love for the ballerina . In the one case the discords do not talk sense purely and simply as music ; in the other case they do talk sense in view of the character and the situation . Or take again the passage in Strauss that depicts the brain of Don Quixote cracking under the strain of impending madness ? a series of discords that were rather startling when we first heard them some twenty years ago , and even today arrest the hear er 's attention :  | ( The quotation shows only the essentials of the harmony ; the reader must figure to himself , in addition , a fortissimo A natural and B flat tearing their way through the tissue in the trumpets and trombones . ) Wagner was quite right : a passage of this kind would probably seem unmotived in a symphony , whereas it talks the soundest sense in a work the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener . Moreover , although the discords themselves are physically mild in comparison with some of those of today , the passage still conveys the sensation of an intolerable strain . Why ? Because there is not merely dissonance but an idea at the back of the dissonance , an idea that has preserved its vitality through the many changes in the world 's musical consciousness during the last twenty years . Some of the dissonances in Mr. Bliss 's work , on the other hand , already sound old-fashioned , because there is nothing in the nature of the musical thinking that confers vitality on them . The simple truth is that our aesthetic has fallen into hopeless confusion of late . A certain school has tried to foist on us the mountebank doctrine that music must not attempt to express anything beyond itself ' ? as if the musical faculty worked in a sort of vacuum , without any infiltration into it from the outer world or from the literature that is the expression of man 's experience of the world ! It really will not do . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in instrumental music alone , and there are other things that become coherent and intelligible only when the clue to them is given by words or by a stage action ; and a great part of the incoherence and unintelligibility of some recent music is due to the composers of purely instrumental music having forgotten this elementary distinction .  | 5th June 1932 WE had a charming example the other day of the tiny seed from which a musical legend may grow . A journalist told us , on the high authority of a tenor , how Toscanini one day sat down at the piano and showed a friend how Wagner used the same chords to express the word mother ' in all his operas , from Rienzi ' to Parsifal ' . ' So far as I remember , the word mother ' does not occur once in Rienzi ' ; nor in The Flying Dutchman ' ; nor in Tannhauser ' ; nor in Lohengrin ' ; nor in theRhinegold ' ; nor in the Meistersinger . ' It may be that I have overlooked an instance or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toscanini , therefore , could hardly have done what he is alleged to have done . I can see , however , this legend going round the musical world for years to come . Rousseau tells us how the scientific world in the eighteenth century was shaken to its foundations by the discovery that a boy in Silesia had been born with a golden tooth . Learned books were written about the phenomenon ; papers were read before learned societies . At last it occurred to someone or other , more sceptical than the rest , to go to the village in Silesia that was said to have been the scene of this experiment , on Nature 's part , in auriferous dentition ; whereupon it was found that the boy 's teeth were all composed of the usual substance . But I am sure the legend was believed for many years after that in France . And so it will be with this story of Wagner and the mother ' chords . Precisely what Toscanini really did on that occasion I do not know ; but presumably he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once drawn attention in these columns ? the practical certainty that whenever a composer happens to be in a particular mood , he will unconsciously revert to a formula which , for him , is the basic expression for that mood . This is not quite the same thing as thematic coincidence ; in hundreds of instances that could be  | cited the melodies are externally so different that their consanguinity has never been suspected . It is only when we have isolated the basic formula that we discover that hundreds of phrases apparently quite dissimiliar can all be resolved back into it . There has been a good deal of not very intelligent talk about the borrowings ' of one composer from another , on the strength of a similarity of melodic outline between a phrase in one and a phrase in another . The coincidence-hunters and the would-be restorers of stolen property have not seen that , from the very constitution of the musical scale , different composers will often write virtually the same succession of notes for quite different reasons . Mendelssohn is accused of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotation ( taken from the Italian Symphony ) , a phrase ( B ) from the Eroica , and Wagner , in turn , ( C ) , of having derived a melody in the Prelude to the third act of Lohengrin ' from either Beethoven or Mendelssohn , or both . But this is a very common sequence of notes , such as might occur to any composer with the chord of the dominant seventh in the forefront of his mind : Sullivan , for instance , employs it in Patience ' to express one of the woes of poor Jane Commentators who have disliked Wagner have been at great pains to demonstrate , as they imagine , that he stole most of his themes from other composers ; even Berlioz was foolish enough to say that the theme of the Wedding Chorus in Lohengrin ' was lifted from Boieldieu 's Les Deux Nuits ' ? on the strength of a chord and an accent that are the commonest small change of  | music ! We are solemnly asked to believe , even , that in a certain substitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sand on the sea-shore , this same work of Boieldieu 's , of which Wagner had probably never heard , is to be found the inspiration for a well-known passage in Tristan ' ! The people who tell us that Wagner stole his Treaty ' motive ( in the Ring ' ) from Liszt 's piano sonata have not gone into this grave matter deeply enough : had they probed a little further , they would have discovered that , on their own theory of theft ' , Liszt himself must have stolen the theme from the overture to Cherubini 's Water-Carrier ' . And everyone knows the similarity ? quite superficial and utterly misleading , as I shall show later ? between a theme in the Merry Wives of Windsor ' overture and a passage in the Meistersinger ' ; another instance , of course , of Wagner 's thievings ! But just as the theory of the Baconian cypher in Shakespeare can be reduced to absurdity by the demonstration of half a dozen other cyphers , so the theory of Wagnerian borrowings can be reduced to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composers in which there can not be any question whatsoever of borrowing . It is extremely improbable , for instance , that either Wagner or Johann Strauss had ever heard even the title of Boieldieu 's Les Deux Nuits . ' Yet the following passage from that work ( No. 2 , A ) : which has been solemnly described as exhibiting a ' sudden harmonic darkening that presages from afar the sententious style of Wagner ' , appears also ( No. 2 , B ) in the Zigeunerbaron . ' One might go on in this strain ad infinitum : the resemblances are all true , and to dwell upon them is all arrant foolishness . Composers do not borrow or steal from each other like this ; what they really do is much more interesting and more curious ? they steal from themselves , in utter unconsciousness that they are so doing . If , a hundred times in the course of their lives , they  | are faced with the same problem of expression , they will almost certainly use , all hundred times , what I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Waltz there is a little melodic curve which the superficial reminiscence-hunter would say has been echoed by Richard Strauss in a love-theme of his Don Juan . ' But when you look into the matter you see that this curve is rooted , as it were , in Richard 's psychic protoplasm ; for him it answers to a mood of high ecstasy . The Don Juan ' phrase is given as A of the next quotation . By its side I place two other Strauss themes , transposed , for the convenience of the reader , into the same key as A : B is the ecstatic cry of Sophie when she first sees Octavian ; C expresses the erotic madness of Salome as she thinks of the forbidden lips of the Baptist . I propose to devote my next article or two to further examples of self-borrowings on the part of Beethoven and of Wagner , and perhaps , if there is space , of other composers ; and , incidentally , to give the true explanation of the alleged thefts of Wagner from Liszt and Nicolai . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicolai reminiscences are merely modifications of basic formulae that are part and parcel of Wagner 's way of musical thinking qua Wagner .  | 12th June 1932 To SHOW the absurdity of the ' reminiscence ' - hunting that looks merely at the pitches of the notes , without taking into consideration the really vital thing , the idea of which the notes are merely the outward symbol , let us examine the case of Nicolai and Wagner . No. 1 A shows the passage in the Merry Wives of Windsor ' overture from which , it is alleged , Wagner derived a passage ( B ) in the third act of the Meistersinger ' . The feature common to them both is the succession of intervals of the fourth . Now this interval happens to be characteristic of a good deal of the music in the scene in the Meistersinger ' with which we are dealing ; C and D show other phases of it . Before I go any further , however , I must forestall a certain type of criticism of the thesis I am about to put forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascending figure of three adjacent notes as being a finger-print of Beethoven , learned reviewers all over the world pointed out that three ascending notes were to be found in many other composers ! One well-informed gentleman discovered them in a song by Mozart ; another , even more erudite , found them in the melody of ' Tipperary ' ! I did not know which to admire most , the profundity of musical knowledge that enabled these gifted publicists to quote examples  | from various composers in which the notes C , D , E , let us say , followed each other in that order , or the innocence that allowed them to suppose that I myself , when discussing this finger-print of Beethoven , was ignorant of the fact that these same notes appear some five hundred million times , at a moderate estimate , in the music of the last four hundred years . As there are only twelve notes in the musical scale , it goes without saying that there is no succession of three or four of them that will not be found somewhere or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived . But the succession only constitutes a finger-print when it is unconsciously used again and again by a particular composer as the expression of what is fundamentally the same personal mood . The three-note sequence to which I drew attention is a Beethoven finger-print because it recurs time after time at virtually the same point in the phrase in dozens of his compositions , and always with the same intention , explicit or implicit . Now intervals of the fourth are as common in melodies as any other intervals ; and indeed they will be found in thousands of other places in the Meistersinger ' than those to which I have directed the reader 's attention . But examples such as those I have quoted constitute a special , though of course quite unconscious , use of fourths on Wagner 's part . Used in this particular way , they are the symbol of a mood of resolution , of energy , of a decision taken , of emphatic insistence upon a point , of dignified or heavy movement . It is difficult to express a purely musical idea in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that basically all the moods I have mentioned have something in common ; and the examples given on page 175 will perhaps make the matter clearer to him . A is the figure of fourths used so largely in Parsifal ' to express the stately tread of the Knights of the Grail . ( In the guide-books it is called the Bells ' motive , but this is an error . Wagner does indeed find it convenient to give the figure to the bells , but from evidence supplied by his works as a whole it becomes clear ! that primarily these fourths are motivated by the idea of a procession . ) B is the melody to which Siegfried and Brynhilde sing the final words of their duet . She he is for ever , is for aye , my wealth and world ' ; here Wagner instinctively drops into  | fourths to suggest the maximum of energy and joyous resolution . C is a particularly instructive example from the end of the Kaisermarsch ; after a good deal of previous insistence on fourths , Wagner hammers away at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emphasis into his melody . The similarity between this and B is evident at first sight . D is rather more subtle : it is sung by Kundry to the words Let me upon his breast lie weeping ' , and repeated in various forms during the following dozen bars or so ; and the melody stamps itself out in fourths because Wagner , having to express here the despair and self-reproach of Kundry at their maximum , unconsciously reverts to the formula that , for him , is inextricably interwoven with all moods expressive of a great decision taken . E is the figure used quasi-symphonically in the first act of Siegfried ' to symbolise the young Siegfried 's physical joy in life ; once more the fourths come up in Wagner 's mind when he has to express a sort of stamping energy . ( The reader will remember also , in this connection , the stamping fourths in the motive of the Giants . ) F is a motive which the commentators have never been able to label quite satisfactorily . I lack space to discuss it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its psychic origin may perhaps be found in its fourths , and I leave the reader to work out the problem for himself .
