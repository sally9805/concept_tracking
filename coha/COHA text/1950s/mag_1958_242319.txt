When Robert E. Kintner , 48 , joined the National Broadcasting Co. on Jan. i , 1957 , after seven years as president of the third-place American Broadcasting Co. , everybody on Madison Avenue knew that if he made good as vice president in charge of NBC 's television network he would one day become president . Last week the day came . In a major topside shuffle , NBC President Robert Sarnoff , 40 , son of NBC Founding Father David Sarnoff , moved up to board chairman , keeping the title of chief executive officer . Into the slot of president , with supervision over all but two of NBC 's 30-odd vice presidents , moved Bob Kintner . <P> Behind the elevation of Kintner , a onetime Washington newspaper correspondent ( for the New York Herald Tribune ) and syndicated columnist ( with Joseph Alsop ) , lay some pretty satisfying sales figures . During the first five months of 1958 , thanks chiefly to a vigorous Kintner-Sarnoff policy of boosting news and special-events coverage by 20% , NBC network TV sales were $90.8 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time last year . This was almost twice the gain registered by the longtime front-runner CBS . ( From January through this May , CBS racked up $104,300,000 in network TV billings v. $98.4 million a year ago . ) <P> But Sarnoff warned that all the sales gain possible from improvement in TV programing has now been registered . " The balance of our effort will have to be in sales , because this is a rougher selling period than a year ago . " As a measure of the roughness , NBC last week was laying off a " couple hundred " of its 6,000 employees . For the fall and winter season , NBC still has about five hours of prime evening viewing time ( usually figured as 7:30 to , 10:30 p.m. ) still unsold v. three hours at CBS without a sponsor . At this time last year both were fully booked .
