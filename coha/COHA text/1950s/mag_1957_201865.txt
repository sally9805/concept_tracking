THE BERNAL DIAZ CHRONICLES ( 414 pp. ) - Translated by Albert Idell-Doubleday ( $5 ) . <P> THE CONQUISTADORS ( 404 pp. ) - Jean Descola-Viking ( $5 ) . <P> The myth of New England is profoundly different from the myth of New Spain , and so are the realities . Both parts of the New World may now be good neighbors , but the heirs of the Pilgrims have a hostile notion of all that the Spanish fathered in Latin America . The austere image of the Puritans of 1620 kneeling on the bare beach at Plymouth has obscured in the U.S. mind the more complicated grandeur of the equally devout men who , 100 years before , had kneeled at Mass on their beachhead near the place they came to call Vera Cruz . The notion persists that the Spanish conquest of the New World was a cruel and disgraceful business . Two new books may do something to destroy what Salvador de Madariaga has called " an article of faith " in the Anglo-Saxon world- " that Spain means cruelty and oppression . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first new English version in 50 years of Daz ' famed history of Corts ' conquest of Mexico . The new translation is so smooth that the story gains as a narrative but lacks something of the awkward dignity with which the proud old soldier must have recalled his years of service under Corts . The book inevitably evokes Herodotus-another old soldier who lived to remember and tell-as Daz begins : " I am an old man of 84 and have lost my sight and hearing . It is my fortune to have no other wealth to leave my sons and descendants except this , my true story , and they will see what a wonderful one it is . " <P> In contrast , The Conquistadors , by French Scholar Jean Descola , lacks the firsthand touch of that truly wonderful story ; it is a brilliant work of historical synthesis , written with an eloquence that is Spanish and an aphoristic bite that is French . For part of the way the two books travel together , since both chronicle the Corts conquest . The 16th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story-the fantastic saga of Hernn Corts , a vagabond student from Salamanca who became one of the most famous conquerors in history . <P> Dream Landscape . " His mission was religious and military , " says Author Descola , and makes clear that at the time no Spaniard saw a contradiction in this . Corts formed his expeditionary fleet in Santiago de Cuba , and his flag bore the device : " Brothers and comrades , let us follow the Cross , and if we have true faith in this symbol , we will conquer . " The facts will always remain astonishing-how Corts scuttled his ten ships ( not " burned behind him , " but dismantled and sunk , despite legend and the Encyclopaedia Britannica ) and with his Aztec mistress , 400 Spaniards , 15 horses and ten cannons , advanced against the unknown things that lay behind an 18,000-ft. mountain wall . The fantastic outcome-in which Spanish chivalry and Christian faith matched themselves against the Mexican capital , set like a city of legend amid its lagoons in the mountains-takes on the nature of both myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the symbols of his faith .
