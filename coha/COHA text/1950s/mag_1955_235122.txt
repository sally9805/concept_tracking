In Baltimore . J. J. Ryan of General Mills . Inc. , reported on a new device designed to help end much of the uncertainty about crashes due to air failure : a flight recorder , set in the cockpit , that transcribes the plane 's speed , direction , altitude and vertical acceleration . Designed to withstand shock as well as fire , the instrument will keep operating ten minutes after engine failure , furnish possible clues to what happened in the crash . Moreover , used in normal safe trips , the recorder 's data will provide a valuable added record of pilot performance and flight irregularities .
