txt The Air Force caused a certain amount of consternation this week by drastically rescheduling its B-70 bomber program . Instead of mass production of the 2,000-mile-an-hour planes , only two test models will be made pending an eventual decision on production . Part of the concern is that the Government has already spent or committed more than 5500 million on B-70 development . And yet , it is said , the program is now all but canceled in order to save money . In the view of some critics , the program either ought to be carried to conclusion or , preferably , never started in favor of more money for missiles . Now it may well be the B-70 program was carried too far and to unnecessarily great cost before this curtailment was ordered . Military men have rarely been noted for extraordinary husbandry in dealing with the taxpayer 's dollar , and even today S500 million is not small change . But it is difficult to see how it is logical , given the world we live in. to quarrel with the principle involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on developing one type of weapon until another is ready to supersede it . In this case the Atlas missile is coming in , and B-70 development can presumably be cut back accordingly . Costly though this process is , the alternative would be more so . That would be , as President Eisenhower put it at his news conference , to stop everything that we 've been doing in a " tremendous hysterical urge " to get something new . It would not only be an expensive answer , the President said , but a bad answer . It would leave the nation protected by no more than a hope of mastering the vagaries of some potential super-weapon . And hysteria , ' which is what some of the defense critics are demanding whether they realize it or not , is never an answer to anything .
