On a lecture circuit through four Ontario cities last week , two ministers of religion preached a confusing creed . They spoke soothingly of peace , but hinted darkly of the power of Russian atom bombs . They professed faith in God , then praised the ways of Soviet Communism . One of them , the Very Rev. Hewlett Johnson , the Church of England 's " Red Dean " of Canterbury , was an old hand at following the twists &; turns of the Communist line . The other was a comparative stranger . He was a Toronto doctor of divinity , James Endicott , 52 , a United Church minister only recently arrived in the front rank of Canadian apologists for Communism . <P> Soft Words . Soft-spoken James Endicott told interviewers that he was no Communist . Canadians who judged by past associations rather than present company might well take his word for it . Born in China , the son of a missionary who later became moderator of the United Church in Canada , Endicott spent most of his youth close to the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became an adviser on social-welfare problems to Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek . Like many another Westerner , he was shocked by the poverty and corruption he saw in China , but his disillusionment ran deeper than most . He came back to Canada in 1947 , highly critical of the Chiang government and full of praise for its Communist enemies . <P> Whether he knew it or not , Dr. Endicott fitted neatly into the propaganda effort of the Labor-Progressive Party , the label under which Canadian Communism has paraded since the Communist Party was banned temporarily in World War II* Endicott turned out a party-line news letter on the Far East , financed , he said , by voluntary contributions . He lectured across Canada , defending the Chinese Communists and gradually broadening his approach into a full apology for Soviet foreign policy . <P> Frank Manner . When the Communist-inspired peace conference was held in Paris last year , Endicott went along . Said he : " It looked to me just like a big missionary convention . " This year , for another Communist peace meeting , the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment plus an interview in Pravda in which he said that Canada was a police state infested with U.S. spies . ( He claimed later that Pravda reporters had misquoted him , but added a hasty explanation that Soviet reporters , like all reporters , sometimes make mistakes . ) Back in Canada , Endicott was a logical choice to escort the " Red Dean " on his pro-Soviet peace junket . <P> Canadian Communism sorely needed new and persuasive friends . The party 's influence has waned steadily since the uncovering of the Russian spy ring in 1946 , when Soviet espionage agents in the Dominion government were linked to the Canadian Communist Party . The Communist vote in last year 's federal election dropped to 32,623 ( from a peak of 111,892 in 1945 ) . Red leadership has been mainly wiped out in Canada 's labor movement . What was obviously wanted was a new face to give the party a kindlier look and dispel the aura of treachery that has hung over it since the spy scandal . Dr. Endicott , with his pleasant voice and frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> *By a vote of 147 to 32 , the House of Commons last week defeated a new motion aimed at outlawing Communist political activity .
