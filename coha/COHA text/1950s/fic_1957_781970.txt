 | a strange ugliness . Like a foal being born and the ground trampled and slimy ; or the cellar of a house being dug in rain . Mud and smoke and hustle and cursing , as if all their spirits had stopped seeking comfort or pleasure , and existed for some tomorrow , vague but bright . Now Audubon came through the crowd , shaking his head . " We have no luck . I will inquire at the counting-house of Mr. Barbeau , a countryman , but time is shortening . If my Lucy , " he took out the letter of introduction from Mr. Page , " would take this to General O'Hara , and ask if he knows of any boat ? " Lucy found General O'Hara , a ruddy-faced , white-haired , ScotchIrish gentleman , at his glass works , behind his writing table , in a chamber that seemed both counting-house and display room . He read the letter of introduction , listened to Lucy 's request , then read the letter again , frowning . " Audubon sounds French , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you . Has n't been too long since the British were far from passing us any favors . I was quartermaster-general here during the Revolution and I know . And they still do everything they can to hinder us . They 've even passed a law to prevent any of their skilled artisans  --  glass-blowers especially  --  from escaping . That 's one way to keep our manufactures down . That 's the kind of favors they do us . " Lucy thought this really quite small of the British , but she said , " My husband thinks of himself as American , and it 's American commerce he wishes to carry on . " ' Well , he 's not the only one to feel the pinch of high warehousing . And boats are scarce . " " Indeed , we have found this out , " she said . " May I sit down a while then ? My husband is to join me here . " The general rose , drew out a chair for her , bowed and went back to his writing table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green glass bottles , thick ugly creamers , squat dull glass sugar basins . Then , they came to rest on a beautiful , sparkling , hanging glass chandelier . She stared with astonishment . Almost involuntarily she went toward it , gazing up , wide-eyed . She saw the general was watching her . She said , " Sir , did you make this ? "  | " I did . And I suppose you 're thinking , How ridiculous ! That it does n't belong in a log house . " Lucy turned to him quickly . " Oh , no . On the contrary ! I was thinking , How remarkable ! " The general narrowed his eyes , peering at her a little distrustfully , but she said , " I was thinking , How splendid it will make some log house ! " The general cleared his throat , and said , almost as if he were ashamed of his gruffness . " That 's the way it seems to me . " And after a while , he actually smiled and said , " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audubon came in . Lucy saw by his face Mr. Barbeau had not been able to help . But the general greeted Audubon with some cordiality now , and inquired , " Are you acquainted with Mr. Tarascon in Louisville ? " " But , yes ! Thanks to Mr. Barbeau , who gave me a kind letter to him when I passed through here before , we now rent a store in Louisville in Mr. Tarascon 's building . " " You 're starting in trade , I hear . A chancy time to be launching , with this non-importation act . There 's still the Louisiana market , though . The Tarascons sent our ship , the Pittsburgh , two hundred fifty tons , which we built here , down to Orleans with coal , then around to Philadelphia and on to France . But with this embargo , even that 's stopped . If only we can get rid of this Jefferson and get the Federalists back in ! Jefferson and his visionary experiments ! These are difficult times ! " " But one must begin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since you know Mr. Tarascon . I 've spoken for space for a consignment of glass to him , on a good sound boat built by George Herron here , of thirty-ton burden . I believe Mr. Tarascon is in no hurry for the glass and if you 'll undertake to explain to him , you might go instead . I 've engaged a ton 's weight , which should allow for your goods , " and he turned , smiling , to Lucy , as if they had some secret between them , " and your wife . Several other families with their goods will be aboard , I believe . Ask for Herron 's boat , at the foot of Smithfield Street . " " Sir , how can I express my gratitude ? "  | " No need . I 'm pleasing myself . You do n't see , of course , what a handsome pair you are , full of vitality , starting out to make a new life . It 's a pleasure for the middle-aged to fancy themselves in your shoes and to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " While Audubon hurried off to Smithfield Street to make certain of the space , Lucy trotted about on errands for him . Late at night , just before she fell asleep , she remembered , Dear me , I had planned to ache today . Oh , well , I 'll do it tomorrow . So much remained to be done that Lucy insisted , next morning , she could go to the doctor alone . Dr. Brunot , examining her in his surgery said , " Had I seen you several days ago , no doubt I could have made out quite an interesting case , but , alas , nature and youth have overtaken me . " He bound her elbow , plastered her shoulder and told her to spend the day quietly . Instead , Lucy hurried down Fifth Street on her first wifely commission . Audubon , busy with transfer of goods from the pack train , had suggested , " If my Lucy would look about for more trade goods to be purchased  --  light in weight , not spoiled by dampness . Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow muddy streets , crisscrossing through the five hundred or more dwellings and stores , she went looking . Here was a shop where skins were dressed and made into hunting shirts , and , at last , a sign , " Ladies ' Mantuas and Bonnets . " In no time , she was stitched up and faced the world a respectable woman . She went on , still looking . Here was a bookshop , " Zadok Cramer 's , " in its window Bibles , spelling books , Latin and Greek grammars . Father would say , take these to the Western country . She went inside . On a table she saw , beside the Tragedies of Shakespeare and an historical novel , The First Settlers of Virginia , a small volume which she picked up with curiosity . She read , THE WESTERN NAVIGATOR Containing Directions for Travelers On the Monongahela , Ohio , Allegheny and Mississippi Rivers by Zadok Cramer Price : One Dollar .  | She bought it . At a table in the rear , she found music stacked . Haydn ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for trade goods . The music was purchased . Then off she dashed to the hotel where she was to meet Audubon for dinner . Lucy , confidence restored by a mended bonnet , changed her frock . As she stood for a moment , undressed , Audubon , with a sudden frown , regarded her bruises , now in full colorful bloom . " Dr. Brunot , this morning , he understood about the accident ? " Brushing out her hair , Lucy hid a smile . " All he said was I must make allowances for the hot blood of his countrymen , " she said . " Zut ! But explanations were made to him about the coach , were they not ? " " I 'm not sure . I recall his exclaiming at the docility of English women . " So ! " He regarded her through narrowed eyes . " I hope the doctor admired my wife 's taste in having her bruises match her eyes ! " Her laughter was interrupted by the dinner bell , and she finished dressing quickly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants . They had scarcely finished dinner , when Audubon said , " No insurance is given for flatboats , and merchants will therefore not deliver without cash . I must run now with gold to pay for the hundred linen shirts , besides the Philadelphia-made brushes and the cloves . " And when that was done , they hurried to the open-air market , still thronged . " We must buy provisions for the boat  --  jerked venison , parched corn , " Audubon said . Lucy thought uneasily of her mother 's cookery book , which did not discuss these . At a torch-lit stall , she marveled at " Beef  --  Four Cents a Pound . " She said , " Today , on The Diamond , I saw an advertisement for workmen  --  at a dollar a day ! In England , a man would earn a shilling a day , and beef would cost a shilling a pound . " " Just that , " he said , " could explain why we find ourselves in this cataract of people flowing from east to west . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back in the feather bed at the Jefferson , with his arm under her head , she thought drowsily , Tomorrow at daybreak , we will be on board the flatboat . I did n't even have a moment to examine the Crith china . Cook fires glimmered on the wharf at dawn . They followed a boy wheeling a barrow with their luggage . He stopped . In the heavy fog Lucy could see the stern , where someone had painted crookedly the name Easy Go . The boat seemed at least sixty feet long . A gangplank led them to the roof , into a confusion of shouting boatmen , bawling cows , men carrying heavy boxes , cackling geese . Audubon went below to stow their luggage . Lucy stepped over sacks of grain , around a wagon body and stopped . A woman , massive as a monument , had set up her spinning wheel . Among the trunks and bedding and bales of hay , one moccasined foot lifted and fell in placid rhythm . " Howdy , " she raised a heroic-sized arm in greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled . Then she heard shouts of " Otterburn ! Is there an Otterburn here ? Hamper for you . From Dr. Brunot . " Murmuring astonished thanks , Lucy received , from the hands of Dr. Brunot 's Negro butler , a huge wicker hamper , with wine bottles protruding from the napkin cover . As she stood with the hamper , she saw below at the gangplank the man and his pregnant wife , the Carmarthans , who had aided her in the coach upset . The boatman shouted down to them , " Nope . Ca n't take you . We 're ready to go ! " Lucy , remembering her own feelings when she and Audubon sought a place , said , " Only two persons ! Could we not find room ? " " It 's time , " the boatman said . " We ca n't wait till they load animals and goods . " The woman looked exhausted . The man leaned on his pushcart . " We 've none but this , " he cried quickly . The boatman , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payin ' twenty dollars . " " I could pay fifteen . Maybe I could work out the rest . " With a contemptuous look at his flat chest and skinny arms , the boatman said , " Cash . "  | Lucy put down the hamper quickly and in her reticule found one of the goldpieces her father had slipped into it the last morning with , " You 'll want teas or something . " She held out to the boatman the coin with a bright eagle on it . " This should make up the difference . " " Where 's the rest of it ? " The couple came up quickly and the man counted out the remainder . The boatman took it , but said . " And do n't try sneakin ' any more goods on board . We 're gittin ' out of here so fast the river 'll be steamin ' . " The young woman looked at Lucy and said softly , " I cai n't rightly say when we 'll pay , but we will . " Suddenly the confusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a final portmanteau was thrown on board , the final passenger hurried up the gangplank . He looked to Lucy like someone she 'd seen before . Then she realized it was the man who 'd stood on the river bank asking , " Anybody here seen Marg'ret Ainsle , my wife ? " He carried a rifle . Eyes down , mouth sullen , looking at no one , he disappeared below . Audubon stood beside her now . The gangplank hit the shore . " Swing her away , Joe ! " a hoarse voice cried . " Lift that oar , you son of a cook ! " Emergency , crisis , sudden disaster strained voices as they made frantic maneuvers through the press of boats . Then  --  they were out in the middle of the brown Monongahela , under the high cliff , moving away from the other boats . The flatboat , as though only now its life had begun , came into the strong , swift push of the Ohio River current . Audubon pointed to the water . " On the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear green Allegheny . Together they make the Ohio . Seeing this always recalls to me the good , kind person and the evil  --  how they are mixed up into one and make a world . " Where the rivers came together the land was like a great arrow , its tip directed westward . The hills on the right ranged mysteriously into the distance . Up until now , Lucy thought , even in the mountains , I had the feeling if I glanced back it was toward home . But now , I 'm moving into the strange , and leaving the strange . But  | around the arrow tip , the thick-pressing boats ready to slide out into the current seemed to say , If you 're frightened , get off the river ! Make way ! CHAPTER TWELVE THE BOX SHE sat on finally became too unyielding , the rank air seeping through the cattle pen under a motionless gray sky , too offensive . The planks of the roof deck , unpainted , were , after only an hour 's use , foul and stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pad resting on a bale , sketched one of the unkempt boatmen . Three of these manned each of the two great side sweeps and in the stern a steersman managed a tree-sized oar . All , to her appalled eyes , were filthy and wild . One , in a dirty red tasseled cap , by misadventure catching her glance on him , lifted a grimy hand to a long skinny mustache and muttered in a French patois to his partner . That boatman , dark beard hanging over a naked torso the color of wet mud , peered at her with yellowed eyes . His eyes are like that murderer 's I saw hauled through Crith on the road to Tyburn to be hanged , Lucy thought . She turned hastily . Perhaps it will rain and the odor will not be so bad , the deck will be cleansed . Rain ! Oh , no . We would have to go below . Now , the boatmen slouched , but there had been fierce pulling to avoid rocks off Brunot 's Island , to pass the riffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Beaver , where a blast furnace belched dirty smoke , they had to push their way through keel boats . But then , they had rounded a low headland and come into an open  | reach . The river had taken a new direction , southwest , and stretched emptily into the unknown . Moving restlessly , trying not to hear the idling male passengers , as she thought , Their speech is sloven as their dress , she walked toward the bow . But the cattle pen odor was too loathsome . When she returned , Audubon said , " Is my Lucy hungry ? " Did that mean going below ? It was long past noon but she said , " Not at all . " " I could bring here the hamper of the good Dr. Brunot . " " That would be best . " But by the time they were removing the napkin , rain had begun to fall . The boatmen , stoic , paid no attention , but passengers scurried below . Already Lucy 's frock was damp . There was no help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four rungs of the ladder , stepped gingerly through the cattle pen where chickens ran loose and a hog grunted in a pen , and came into the covered part of the flatboat . If fifteen men , women and children , their dogs , bedding , farm implements , household gear and victuals , with one fireplace for cooking and no other household arrangements , had been crowded into the root cellar at Fatland , it might have been as noisome and confused . Cringing away from the odor of strong sweats and rancid fat sputtering in a skillet , she choked on dank smoke drifting back into the shelter . Despairingly she glanced through one of the four portholes , but rain fell now with nagging steadiness . A thin woman at the cook place said , " If it 's the fire you want , you 'll have to wait till I feed mine . " With a long skewer , she lifted a hunk of fat pork , dripping a trail of grease toward a wooden trencher held by her husband . His collarless white shirt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprecation . Beyond piled boxez the massive woman , N'omi , bent over a wooden pail , wringing with huge freckled arms a shirt , then hung it with others , dripping rivulets to the deck . " If I 'd knowed there 'd be rain , I would n't have washed . " A dog stealing food was kicked ; it whined . Lucy stood stupidly until Audubon guided her past four men  | cursing in the half-dark over a card game , past a young man and young woman , well dressed , genteel-looking , she 'd noticed momentarily on the deck . The couple sat beside a porthole , stiffly , as if daring anyone to drive them away . Lucy saw Mrs. Carmarthan , staring tiredly ahead , seemingly glad to sit at last even amid bad air and snarling voices . Finally they came to their own belongings . Audubon had piled them to give some privacy . With a slight shock she recognized her portmanteau , her trunk , thought of the china wrapped in her petticoats . She could hear Miss Smith 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be different when they arrived . It would have to be . " I did not place our goods near a porthole , for a rain with wind may dampen all , " Audubon said . " But come , here is one where we may have our lunch . " Nausea mounting , she thought , I can not eat here . It is impossible , but she sat on a box , pretending to nibble at the cold fowl . " When it stops raining , " he was looking at her , " life is better . " She pasted a small bright smile on her face . The rain seemed sullenly to insist , " Get used to me . I 'm here to stay . " In the half-light he tried to sketch a sad log village pushed against the oily water by low gray-green hills . She tried to read Mr. Cramer 's Navigator , to care that " The Congress should remove riffles from the channel . " Only toward dusk did the rain lessen . She could no longer hear it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , to eat but she had no appetite . " Could we not go up now for fresh air ? " On the roof deck , fog coiled like a wet gray cat , and they heard a boatman growl , " We ought n't to be movin ' in this fog . " " Hank 's tryin ' to make Georgetown . " " Oh , sure , willin ' wenches in Georgetown , but we ought to tie up . Ca n't see a thing ! " The damp fog chilled her but she said , " I 'd rather stay up here , " though they could not see the shore . She was watching a lantern someone had hung over a plow handle swing back and forth when there was a grinding crash and the boat stopped moving . A woman screamed , and Audubon , even before the cry , " Sand-bar ! We 're on a bar ! Everyone over ! " came bawling through the mist , was removing  | his shoes . Women scurried about , calling , anxious . Rolling trouser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the splash as they jumped into the shallow water , hear the grunting and cursing , " Everybody now ! All together ! Bring a pole , Jack ! Joe , git that sweep clear ! " Lucy peered below . When the fog stirred , lifting slightly above muddy water , she could see the sand-bar , with a few straggling bushes . She found herself staring at two dreadful swollen objects . Hand to mouth , she repressed a scream , catching at the sleeve of a boatman hurrying past , then pointing . He peered , shrugged . " Couple of stiffs . We seen ' em . Kilt each other in a fight , prob'ly . Hank says might 've been plague though , not to touch ' em . " He leaned over the side and bawled back through the fog , " I 'm on the port sweep , Hank . Ready ? " What kind of a country were they coming into where even the dead were left unburied ? Now the hold seemed a shelter . Below , two lanterns swung from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard a soft moaning and nearly stumbled over Mrs. Carmarthan . " The boat bumped me offen the box . I hit the edge of that bar'l . " N'omi Keefer had heard too . " I 'll lift her . You bring some skins . " Lucy stood , unsure . " Skins ? " N'omi disappeared and in a few moments returned . " Here . Buffalo skins 'll make her a bed . " Deftly , she arranged , and , as if Mrs. Carmarthan were no weight at all , lifted her . " I got some wild ginger in my poke . A brew of it 'll be good for her . There 's water bilin ' . " Mrs. Carmarthan 's eyes were closed . Lucy thought , Her face is all sunk away from its fresh blooming . Soon N'omi returned with a pottery cup , steaming , and Lucy resigned her place to the herbbringer . It was quite dark before she heard shouts , the swish of water past planks , felt the boat shudder and move . Audubon brought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucy tried to eat . " We can not reach Georgetown , where is an inn . We must sleep here . " He brought buffalo robes and threw his greatcoat over them for her . When he fell asleep , she was still awake , hearing a dog  | scratching , someone snickering , a strangulated snore , hearing bumping , laughing and cursing on deck over her head . She could smell the gamy odor from the skins . A picture came to her . She seemed to see each ball in the fringe around her bed canopy at Fatland , smell the lavender loosed from linen sheets , then the fresh flower odors in the cool , serene dining parlor , hear the murmur of charming , precise voices . And when the food from the hamper is gone ? Cooking food in the reeking confusion , with these stragglehaired , unwashed , coarse-voiced women ? She had scarcely thought of her decision at the coach upset in the mountains . But now , she could hear the lady from the Philadelphia coach saying , " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " She could hear stomping overhead , water swishing against planks , then , nearer at hand , perhaps beyond the next pile of bales , an argument , whispered at first , then more petulant . " If Mama had known it would be like this , Harold , she 'd have been glad to pay for a private carriage for me ! " Lucy guessed it was the pretty , well-dressed young woman . " You do n't care how I feel . Why could we not have lived in Baltimore instead of going to Orleans ? " " Now , Henrietta , we 've been all over this before . Father 's investments are in New Orleans . " Then Henrietta 's words came like small hurled stones . " Sylvester 's family kept their investments in Baltimore . Mother wanted me to marry him . " Lucy felt an ashamed flush coming into her own face . I almost . . . Why , she sounds like a tiresome child ! But even when her stifled sobs quieted , Lucy could hear snarls and coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low anguished moaning . Mrs. Carmarthan ? Lucy went to her quickly , found her alone and guessed Mr. Carmarthan was above . But here was N'omi , a candle at the end of her enormous upraised arm like a pinpoint of light . N'omi said , " We 're here , honey . We 'll take keer . I 'll jist go put on my moccasins . All kinds of varmints crawlin ' underfoot . " Then in a quiet voice she said to Lucy , " Best stir up the fire . " Ashes still glowed , but with anxious haste , Lucy seized a poker  | and stirred . After a sputtering and smoking , the glow died . Mrs. Keefer will think me a stupid child , she thought . Father was always so clever at saving a fire . If only he were here . " It is Mrs. Carmarthan , is it not ? " Audubon was blinking sleepily behind her . " I will make the fire . " When Lucy sped back , N'omi looked at her . " Slow yourself . Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fill the big kittle . " On deck , above the glimmering fire in a three-legged iron pot , strange , larger-than-life shadows lunged about as in a grotesque dance . One , hand on hip , in mimicking falsetto piped , " Then , she says , I would n't know the aft from a hole in the ground . " A jug was raised to a tilted head . In a huddle around a lantern , a hand was lifted high , a card slapped down . There was coarse laughter , a yell , " You son of a bastard . I lose my pay ! " and a scuffle . In the stern , she found the pail , let it down over the side , heard the splash , the tug . As it filled , she thought , Water that washed over those corpses no one even cared to bury ! And here is more life coming . " Hi , Joe , " a hoarse voice said , " what 's them lights downstream ? " " Ca n't say . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drizzle she could see a few lights murky on a sodden river-bank . The Ohio country . When she filled the kettle and returned , she found , besides N'omi and the thin woman who had been at the cook place , Carmarthan and Audubon . Audubon said , " Madame , would it be well if we went with the skiff to the settlement ahead to find an apothecary ? " " A good idea , " N'omi replied . " I birthed seven of my own , one with no one by , and many 's the neighbor I helped , but you never know . Way things look , " she stroked Mrs. Carmarthan 's hair back from a sweating brow , " best hurry . " Carmarthan seemed relieved at being able to do something . He and Audubon went above and Lucy heard the skiff leaving and the drunken shouts of the men on deck , calling obscenities after them . She realized she was wringing her hands when she noticed N'omi watching her .  | " How long you been a wife , honey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any young ' uns ' fore that ? " Lucy shook her head . " You best go to bed . Come time to have your own , you 'll think it 's worse than it is . Mrs. Gansey and me 'll take keer . If there 's a thing , we 'll call . " Lying in the dark , Lucy could see N'omi 's shadow , magnified by the candle . She seemed to have many flailing arms . " I 'll knot this here quilt for you to tug on , " she was saying . Her arms reminded Lucy of that statue given Uncle Ben by an Oriental merchant : Siva , a diety of destruction , and , strangely , reproduction . " I 'm too tahred , " Mrs. Carmarthan sounded childish and petulant . " I cai n't go on . " " Just a little piece more , " N'omi said . " We was s'posed to git to Louaville ' fore it come , " the girl protested . " I been too fur now . I 'm tahred . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jist let yourself flow with the current . Jist keep goin ' on  --  like this here ark . Let the current lift you and take you where it will . There 'll be a fine stretch around the bend , with fun and frolic . " " I cai n't . Weary , weary mountains . I jist want to set down and die . " " Plenty times I said the same , but then I stopped pushing myself . I just let go and said , God , you 'll have to carry me a while , and the big current lifted me and took me . Jist like it takes this ark . Less you git stubborn and say , I cai n't , ' I 'm goin ' to stay on this towhead . " The girl let out a sudden sharp cry . " There 's a big river flowin ' , carryin ' us all  --  cryin ' women , feisty men and little children . Jist let go and that big current 'll flow you along too , if you trust it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finally heard quick steps and Audubon 's voice , " Madame , we are not fortunate . No apothecary lives there . "  | " Never mind . I 'll take keer . You best go on with your own wife . She looked scared . " From behind the bales , Lucy could hear Henrietta 's stifled hysterical sobs , and she thought , Perhaps I look scared , but at least I 'm not doing that ! When Audubon came , saying , " This is bad , and thy first night on the river ! " Lucy made her tone calmly matter-of-fact . " I 'm quite all right . Mrs. Keefer said there was nothing I could do . " " Then we will try to sleep . " She did not bother to take off the clothing hastily thrown on . She knew it would be impossible to sleep . CHAPTER THIRTEEN LUCY HEARD ROBINS singing and opened her eyes . Sun like solid gold bars slanted through portholes . Audubon , regarding her with a tender , brooding look , sat , holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drank the tea . Then she remembered . " Mrs. Carmarthan ? " " All is well . " Lucy heard a snuffling , angry little cry . " Thou hearest ? On shore , the grapevine is blossoming . Come up when thou art ready . " Lucy came on deck . Wet emerald hills glistened . A dripping willow on a tow showered her with moist diamonds . The steersman lifted his horn , wound once , twice , as if to prolong the sound skipping down the burnished river . A canoe , with three silent Indians , their copper skin glowing beneath their unbelievable feathers , shot over the water , spray sparkling from their lifted paddles . Even the boatmen 's red shirts and white-fringed blue vests did not seem soiled and tawdry . In their bare feet , they no longer seemed murderers ,  | but childish giants . Perhaps it was all just the light glinting through a prismatic morning . The flatboat glided through the forest , horses whinnied , geese cackled , smoke rose from the iron fire pot with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With one foot , N'omi treadled rhythmically on her spinning wheel . With the other she held firm a fish pole extending beyond the deck , shouting out jolly instructions and advice to her immediate social circle . " Gran'paw , you ought a see if your fiddle bust like the coffee-mill in that slam-bang on the sand-bar . " Her thin , leathery little husband , shavings drifting over his corduroys , whittled out dovetailing on a new drawer for a coffee-grinder . N'omi 's laugh hooted loud as the boatman 's horn . " If the fiddle 's bust , we might as well go back to Franklin County ? " The foot holding the fish pole lifted . Almost without missing a beat with the other , she tossed a flipping perch on deck . To Lucy , who stood mouth agape , she said , " Run you down to Mrs. Carmarthan and ast if she 'd like a little fried fish . A new mother has a right to be choosy . " But the new mother said , " Fish ile 'd be bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The French call this la belle riviere . We 're thinking we 'll name her Labelle . " The infant was wrapped in an old linen shirt . When Lucy rejoined Audubon on deck , she brought scissors , her needle-case and a frock . " This sprigged lawn , " she smiled , " was meant to dazzle you . But , " her scissors snipped into it , " out of it I should manage a sacque and an infant gown . " At the message about the " ile " N'omi 's textile and fishing operations suspended . " Maybe Mrs. Carmarthan 'd fancy a little broth . " With a murderous lunge she came down on a squawking chicken . Lucy closed her eyes . When she opened them , white feathers in handfuls whirled over the side . N'omi kept on talking . Her menfolk  --  Gran'paw , mending a boot , a half-grown son cracking corn with a pestle , her husband squinting along a joint  --  continued their placid , silent activities like satisfied horses in a well-fitted harness . Mrs. Gansey came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puckered together like a buttonhole . She bore down on the males of  | tier family with all the charm of an angry monkey . " Mr. Gansey , fetch up my wheel ! " He stopped chewing long enough to yell at a heavily-muscled straw-haired youth of eighteen or nineteen , who was rolling shot around in his hand . " Hey , Mo , git yore maw 's wheel . " " You always pick on me . Git Nev to do it . " " Neville 's guttin ' a fish . You do it . " When Emma Gansey 's wheel was finally brought , she spun as if reproving the idle , including the lazy clouds drifting above , even Audubon . He had gone ashore at daybreak , shot a wood-thrush , mounted it on a board before him and was drawing . " A grown man ! " At least her own husband was chewing . But N'omi , seeing Lucy 's stitching for the infant , said , " I got yarn in my poke . A couple of good knitters like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booties in a shake ! " The purse string around Mrs. Gansey 's mouth drew tight . " All right , " she said finally , " but I 'm tired of doin ' things for the shiftless , who could have worked , same as me . " And Lucy , new to the estate , observed the ways of matrons . Mile after mile , they floated between the low green hills of Virginia on one side , and the low green hills of Ohio on the other . Sitting beside her , Audubon drew with diligence , the beautiful reddish-brown back and graceful tail , the cream-colored breast spotted in brown . " This wood thrush , I admire him much . When formerly , I am in the forest , solitary , I hear him and I feel like his brother . He is shy , he is sensitive , he is lonely , but his song is strong , melodic , of a clarity . Now when I hear him , his song sounds to me like a lover 's song , a lover who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings again , in suspense that he may not please . " He touched her hand softly . She smiled at him , then bent , threading her needle anew . Once during the long blue-green afternoon , Morgan Carmarthan sat with them . " I manned the brake on a wagon from Laurel Ridge in to Pittsburgh , " he said , " That 's how we caught up with you . " The rest of his story emerged , too . In Wales he had been a schoolteacher and had indentured himself to get to America . " I was  | bought off the boat in Philadelphia by a brewmaster . I could n't lift his hundred-pound sacks of malt , and he sold me to a farmer . The farmer had a bound girl , Jean McTaw , sixteen , who 'd been sent by her parents from the Carolinas , hoping she 'd get to the Ohio country . And so she will , for I married her ! Only first we had to serve four years . " They swept around an abrupt bend and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boatmen scrambled to the sweeps . " Ho ! The raft ! " A raft seemed suspended directly in front of them in the channel . " She 's stuck on a tow ! Hard over ! Pull away . " Closer and closer they bore down . With every muscle the boatmen pulled . Lucy found herself looking into the terrified faces of the raft passengers . Then , they glided past . " Phew ! About as much room as atween the eyes of a fox ! " Then into another reach and all was quiet again . A red-breasted grosbeak lit on the deck as if by mistake , and flew away . Solitariness seemed something you could touch . Once they passed a mansion above the water , pillared in the Greek Revival manner like Fatland , and , seemingly , as remote . When they came into a little cove for fresh water from a spring , a small animal , an otter , swam past with a fish in its jaws . The raft they had almost rammed floated past them . In the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman sewed , spectacles on nose . A man sat , back to door , chewing . A plump young girl washed long hair in a basin , another hung clothes . A horse was tethered , and a bushy-tailed dog frisked near a haystack . They floated past in silence , a self-sufficient little world . In the bow of the Easy Go , humped over , his rifle on his knee , gray coat tight across his shoulders , black hat shading his eyes as he scanned the river ahead , sat the man Lucy had come to think of as The Figurehead . The husband of Marg'ret Ainslie . He was in a separate world , too . When Lucy loaned Morgan Carmarthan her Navigator , he read it aloud in a voice intimating everyone ought to listen  --  though no one did  --  intoning that they were now nearly sixty-one miles from  | Pittsburgh , that was Buckeye Run and Mill just passed , in which village was a pillory , a disgrace to an enlightened people ; that the next town would be Holliday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back country , and that the citizens were kind to strangers . Mr. Carmarthan set up around himself the aura of a schoolmaster , his accustomed world , Lucy thought . And N'omi and Mrs. Gansey  --  knitting , tongues clacking , Mrs. Gansey saying , " Our farm in the Shenandoah was plum wore out ? " they brought their own world with them , too . And even ourselves , thought Lucy , Laforest drawing , I sitting near him , sewing , much as we have many a time at Fatland  --  we bring ours , too . All of us , moving , seeking , but taking the old shell along . In the late afternoon , the men gathered in a meeting . " We could put in at Wheeling , or go down to Grave Creek and tie up just about sundown when the turkeys go to roost , iffen anyone needs fresh grub . " Lucy could see it was not an enjoyable meeting , because there was so little to argue about . About five they glided past Wheeling , high on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they could see many wagons . Finally , they warped in for the night at Grave Creek . The hunters were successful , and when Audubon returned with a fine turkey , Lucy was astonished at his skill in its preparation . With it , they finished a bottle of malmsey from the hamper . Each family prepared and ate their meal alone , but afterward , in the air of peace and utter stillness , as they watched the sun setting , talk began . N'omi was saying , " Back in Franklin County , Pennsylvania , about this time , the cows is comin ' in across the meadows . " On the shore , towering above the flatboat , rose a great mound of earth , a hundred feet long , fifty feet high ; an Indian Mound , it was called , a burial place , filled , it was said , with the bones of an ancient , unknown people . To Lucy , the Indians themselves seemed mysterious enough , yet here was a handprint more mysterious still , of a people so antique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the stillness , they heard a plashing . Crossing a creek , a little way up a wild glen , straggled several great dark animals , heads  | bent . " Still some buffalo here ! " Guns were being cleaned . No one raised a rifle . As those on the flatboat sat motionless , the buffaloes passed into the forest . " Back where we come from , used to be buffalo , " N'omi said . " Long ' fore my time . But my family was one of the first white families to come there . My own aunt was scalpted by savages one day goin ' to the spring-house . We used to step around the spot , goin ' for water . She always had to wear a mobcap , and her maw was killed and their cabin burned . Ours was burned , too . The British did it during the Revolution . " Lucy felt a self-conscious flush . At the same time she wondered why they had left a spot where their ancestors had fought to stay . But , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family , " N'omi said , " I was the on'y girl dint marry a farmer . Martin 's a wheelwright . He made our wagon . Many another on the road , too . He figures plenty folks 'll need wagons in Kentucky . Of course , Gran'paw , he 's jist comin ' for the excitement . " " Folks huddlin ' together too much back there , " Gran'paw said . " A cabin every mile . Spiles the huntin ' . " " It was the war spiled you , Gran'paw . You miss it . " " I was a sergeant in the Continental Army . Yessir , I was a wagonmaster for General Washington . Had ten Conestogas , all six-horse bell teams , a purty sound comin ' over a hill ! But when we went out to borry flour or bacon or whiskey for the general , I took the bells off . Redcoats could spot us too easy . I mind once I had to go all the way to the Brandywine before anyone 'd give us flour . Just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the bells back on , and when the men heard , they stood up , the ones that could , and cheered . " " Martin fought , too , " N'omi said . " At Yorktown and Three Rivers . But he just wanted to get back to makin ' wagons and contraptions . Any time Martin 's walking , in the forest or a street , all the time his eyes are scourin ' around , lookin ' for a piece of white oak or dogwood to season up for a handle or a cog . Martin 's always makin ' new inventions . "  | " I have invented one thing , is all  --  a wagon retarder , " Martin ventured to contradict , but mildly , as if N'omi did the talking , the way wives took over the cooking or shirt-ironing , and he was glad to be rid of the necessity . An umber aureole glowed behind long narrow cloud streaks in front of the low sun . The river was inked with turquoise , indigo , brown . Now the woods were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings a sadness . One feels the  --  what is the word ? ? the fleetingness ? Of the buffalo gone from the home valley . And we are the noise in the wilderness . We are the axe stroke . " Far down the river , a boatman 's high whining horn echoed in wisps . " The buffalo hear that . I think this forest hears it , too . Perhaps it 's better these oaks and maples go for houses in Pittsburgh , better the beautiful river flows with dirt from the blast furnace at Beaver ? " he broke off , listening . " A whippoorwill ! " He brought out his flute and soon , rippling into the evening peace , glinted a Bach air . N'omi puzzled for the beat with her foot . " You could n't sing to it , could you ? " The sun disappeared . A path shimmered like gold foil someone had dropped on the water . Open to the sky , to the smell of water , Lucy saw how everyone on the flat deck was for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just like a golden ladder you could climb into heaven on . " The breeze died , the saffron turned to brown . " Well , " Gran'paw said , " Looks like God pulled the ladder up for the day . Might as well do a little fiddle scrapin ' . " And he sawed a repetitious tune . Mr. and Mrs. Sylvester Valentine , alone at the far end of the boat , stared at the water , their backs to the others . I understand why , Lucy thought , but as for myself , these people no longer offend me . And when Carmarthan , in an excellent tenor , sang " Oh , where hae ye been , Lord Randall , my son ? " and N'omi , who had fetched her zither , joined in huskily at the end of each stanza with " For I 'm tahred a huntin ' , and wanta lie down ? " Lucy sang too . Between songs , they could hear the river lapping against the  | shore . " Them wild grape blossoms sure has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , " Audubon said , " it is yet early enough in season that we will not have mosquitoes . " He brought buffalo robes on the deck . Ursa Major moved across the Ohio Valley , sliding down , down . CHAPTER FOURTEEN IT BEGAN , LUCY remembered , the next morning . As they floated under a cloudless sky between the shores of Ohio and Virginia , the sun stared at the deck with a ferocious lack of mercy . Then too , everyone was a little ill from too much turkey ? everyone except the Audubons . This made them seem , like the Baltimoreans , a little above it all . Squinting against stabbing light , Lucy saw what appeared to be an otter swimming away from the Virginia shore , coming toward them . After a while she saw it was a man . The river was a third of a mile wide here . He moved slowly now , as if approaching exhaustion . " Hey ! " Neville Gansey yelled . " Lookit ! A nigger ! " His hand closed on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the side , " I kin crack him on the coconut , first try ? " " A fip you ca n't , " an idling boatman grinned . As he raised the pole , Lucy sprang at him , grasping it . " No ! You sha'nt ! If it were a dog swimming , you 'd not ! " Ganseys converged , Audubon came running , as the swimming Negro , panting , rested a hand on the side of the boat . " Gim me that ! " Neville tugged . " I 'll push him right back in the river . " But Audubon , with iron grip , held the pole . " Non ! Do not . " Nev could only glare , but Mo Gansey , feet pounding hard on  | the deck , ran toward them . The swimmer , as though the few mninutes ' respite were enough , swam away toward the Ohio shore . Nev ran to the approaching Mo , and they muttered , looking toward the Audubons . " Back where we come from , " Mo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger . " Audubon diligently feathered in the tail of the wood thrush , and Lucy , trying not to look distraught , pretended to go on reading . A smudge of mist heightened the fierce glare , so that it was impossible to look at the water , and there was nothing else to look at but endless low hills . The snuffling , snarling cry of the baby inflicted her discomfort on the others . Lucy began to understand that on a flatboat , if one were n't interested in reading , or drawing or observing the country , there were not many ways to pass the time  --  except to bait one 's neighbors . The endless afternoon sagged like a long gray rope hanging between unseen poles . A boatman tried to stir the dead weight of time by provoking " The Figurehead " in the bow , the husband of Marg'ret Ainslie . " Expectin ' to shoot a b'ar ? " the boatman said , grinning slyly . " The Figurehead , " his mouth sullen , turned away with a cold , withdrawn glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his heart , Lucy thought , no one tries to dissuade him . Then out of the deadening glare , they saw a keel poling up stream . By now Lucy knew keels spurned flatboats . Not because of size  --  the keel was only eight or nine feet wide . But the square flatboat would be broken up at the end of the journey and sold for firewood ; it could float only downstream . The pointed keel , with rope or poles or sail and a larger crew , meant to force its way back up the river and make many trips . Lucy had already seen one being cordelled up  --  the men on the shore tugging thirty tons of boat against the current on the end of their long rope . On this one poling up stream , the boatmen , by their costumes Canadian French , moved all in rhythm . Setting their poles on the rocky bank , bodies bent almost perpendicular , moving with tremendous effort along the cleated walk around the edge of the boat , almost crawling to  | they then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over . The steersman set their rhythm , singing : Mo Gansey , long arms hanging loose , mouth in a sneering smile , slouched up to him . One of the younger Keefers , Neville Gansey and one of the boatmen listened , eyes sly . Heat rose in waves from the planks . Audubon picked up his pencil and began to crosshatch a background . They had come a hundred and seventy miles . Mo sneered , " Do n't even talk English , and comes around awready interferin ' . Tellin ' us what to do . " Audubon kept on drawing . " Anything I hate 's a nance , tootin ' on a flute and prancin ' around like he 's better than folks ! " " Draw me a birdie on a stem , Mo ! " a falsetto voice from the gathering group cried . Lucy trembled . Audubon looked up and smiled . " I believe you wish to make a fight . " The idlers , monotony-ridden , surged forward . Even the steersman , not to be cheated out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | growled , " On a flatboat , anyone plays too high a tune , we know how to make him sing low ! " Audubon did not even lay down his pencil . " I occupy myself with things of more importance . " I Ialf growl , half jeering laughter rose but broke off at a hard bump . The boat had grounded . The steersman ran to his neglected par , and as the idle went over the side , free-floating violence , for the moment , was channeled into fighting mud . On a sticky evening , with the air full of irritating gnats , they tied up in a sycamore-lined cove . Audubon fished from the stern . Lucy heard snickers , saw Nev go ashore and return with a large stone . She saw the stone hurled over Audubon 's head , strike the water with a splash . There 'd be no more fishing there tonight . Cran'paw Keefer , Martin Keefer and Mr. Carmarthan saw , but did nothing . Turning , Audubon saw the Ganseys waiting hopefully . Calmly changing his fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evening . " The sun sank behind long , dull-red clouds . It 's not a ladder tonight , Lucy thought . More as if God drew a red line and said , " Not much of a day , and it 's done . " Afterward , she could not fall asleep , but stared into the dark , grappling with ugly , newly perceived facets of existence . Mr. Valentine wears kid shoes and holds his wife 's embroidery skein , but they do not provoke him . He is not spirited , confident , elegant . In this crude world , with its incivil standards , slovenly speech , it seems they must express their fear of the fine in hostile violence . Sun bored through mist again the next day so that the water steamed . The deck of the flatboat was like a grid where mortals were fixed to broil . After they had passed Marietta and the Little Muskingum , the steersman said , " We orta make Letart 's Falls by night . " The current pushed them downstream but a dry wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes frantic , at each island and riffle . In sullen heat , tempers soured . The passengers stared in deadly monotony at endless low hills . Except Martin Keefer and Audubon . Martin sanded a fork of  | white oak he 'd found and Audubon drew a wood duck shot that morning . The flatboat worked around a turn into a long narrow reach , into a swift current full of floating logs , with small islands on the right-hand shore . From one island , a canoe glided , carrying two people , a man and a woman . Light flashed on spray from a lifted paddle . " The Figurehead " stood up , aimed his rifle and fired . The woman slumped over , half-trailing in the water . Everyone cried out , but only Audubon and Carmarthan rushed toward him . " The Figurehead " aimed and fired again . The man in the canoe , who had risen , fell into the water and disappeared . Before anyone could reach him " The Figurehead " jumped from the Easy Go and , holding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping him , toward the drifting canoe . " He wantsa make sure he got her ! " someone cried . At that moment , a heavy log , twenty or thirty feet long , struck the swimmer full on the head . The head , the arm , the rifle , disappeared beneath the muddy water . The canoe , with its burden , had come to rest on a towhead . The people on the flatboat deck gazed back , silent , frozen . Lucy understood the flatboat could not turn back ; they were in the main current , floating swiftly downstream . No , you could not turn back . You had to leave it there . Something dreadful which you had allowed to occur , left to those who came afterward , to face as best they could . For once , quiet hung over the flatboat , broken only by the irritating cry of the baby . But , during the long gray blank of the afternoon , they came to the island of Harmar Blennerhasset . His mansion was deserted . Aaron Burr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife had fled . Sinister frustrations found an outlet . With savage viciousness , chunks of wood were hurled at the mansion 's windows . After the flatboat passed , only gutted holes looked out on the weed-high garden . Even this senseless violence was not enough . They 'd come , in four days , two hundred and thirty miles . They had n't reached Letart 's Falls . Dangerous rocks stopped them at sundown and they  | were forced to tie up at Devil 's Hole . Audubon , with his specimen pinned up as usual on a board , tried to finish the wood duck . He said , " There is perhaps yet light enough , " and went below for colors . Lucy , walking for exercise toward the stern , turned in time to see Mo Gansey lift the specimen high and hurl it far into the river . Fear froze her . If Laforest flies into a rage ! There are so many of them ! What shall I do ? Audubon returned now , missed his specimen , glanced suspiciously at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint , I feel ill . Best help me below ! " She 'd saved him this time . But next time ? She felt a breathless sense of panic . At nightfall , a thunderstorm growled in the north and they had to sleep below . But it was not the stifling atmosphere that kept her awake . Next time , there may be nothing to divert him . My husband is not a cool-tempered man . If he had not been dissuaded that other time , he had been angry enough to kill Mr. Dacosta. 1 am afraid of this rude world . She could see again the vicious stoning of deserted Blennerhasset , two people murdered in a canoe , and she thought how the passengers had allowed these things to happen and had drifted on , as if with a shrug . And last night , when those two boatmen quarreled , one had a knife . Every hour they were sliding away from the kindly , the permanent , the wise . 1 did not turn back at the upset in the mountain , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would Father not say it was the sensible thing to do ? As soon as it was light enough , she consulted Mr. Cramer 's Navigator , and found Point Pleasant to be the next place where trail crossed . When Audubon woke , he found her poring over the book . She said , " We are but two hundred and eighty miles down . At Point Pleasant , we might find horses , or a keel to return us to Pittsburgh . " Now he was wide awake . " It is thy wish to return ? " I am afraid for you . Afraid of these dreadful creatures with their muscless hostility . They hate you for no reason . " " It is like a quarrel in a tavern . It blows up fierce over nothing , blown away over nothing . "  | " But one takes too much of a chance to be exposed to them , for they are not governed by conscience or reason . It is only good sense to remove before something dreadful happens . I think we must get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My Lucy , do not worry thy brains . Battles I do not care for , but I do not get off the boat either . Be cheerful , the sun shines and I love thee ! " It was the morning of the fifth day . The sun rose with a promise of more punishing heat . " Travelin ' on the Sabbath ! " Mrs. Gansey scolded . " Back where I come from , many 's the Sunday the deacon 's gone right on the pike and stopped travelers and made them rest , whether or not . " But the steersman said , " We got ta pass Letart 's Falls today , and in daylight . " Mrs. Gansey had to content herself with nagging her menfolk into a Sunday shirt . As the flatboat maneuvered into the current , a keel passed , floating down . On top of the little cabin on its deck , a woman in a red dress , with a red parasol , sat in a high-backed chair fanning herself . A boatman on the flat cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridin ' high on a keel down the Ohio of a hot green mornin ' . " A boatman called after her , " See you at Natchezunder-the-hill , dearie ! " A keel-boat man appeared . He had heard and raised a pole threateningly . " Scum ! Nothin ' lower than a flatboat ! " Others , hearing , appeared , fists shaking , " Nobody fools with our woman . Ought to be sunk ! We 'll catch youse at Maysville ! " But they saw them before that . At noon , they came to the rocks of Letart 's Falls . They warped in for the boatmen to wolf down jerked meat , toss off their whiskey ration and rest before going through . The keel was already warped in . The woman sat , fanning herself and chewing idly . There was not a keel-boat man in sight but they heard rifle fire in the woods . " They 're off in the forest shootin ' grub , " one of the men on the flatboat said . " I 'd sure like to git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't try it . We ai n't goin ' to git in no fight with keelers . You know them . They 're mean . Stay here ! " But when no one was looking , Mo Gansey , with a strut , slipped over to the keel . After a bit he and the woman disappeared in the cabin . When the keelers came from the woods with rifles , carrying turkeys and pheasants , Nev Gansey screamed , " Mo ! Mo ! Come outa there ! They comin ' . " By the time Mo scrambled on deck , jumped ashore and started running , the keelers were close enough to see him . With horrible cries and threats , they charged . The flatboat , which had been preparing to leave , now pushed out hurriedly , as Mo sprang onboard . He seized a pole and helped push . They were in the current . The keelers stopped running , but raised threatening fists . The flatboat was safe , for now . Emma Gansey fussed at Mo , " You shouldn't 've talked to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mo seemed slyly proud of his sortie , though the boatmen cursed , " Ought to know any fight with keelers ends with a buryin ' . " The elder Gansey said , " Ah , we could take care of them . Ai n't they twelve of us ? " " Ten , " Mo said . " You ca n't count the Henpeck from Baltimore , to say nothing of that French ruffle . They ai n't hardly men . " Lucy knew Audubon heard . But he had shot another wood duck , and , engrossed , hardly looked up from his drawing . The next afternoon , as they moved through a long monotonous reach , a pirogue with a sail , going down-stream , came along with a hail , " Hello , the flat ! You the Easy Go , ai n't you ? I got a message for you . From a keel back aways , loadin ' flour at the Big Kanawha . That 's where I come into the river from Mason County , Virginia . They was held up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they would catch you at the Big Scioto River in the riffle and they 's goin ' to take you apart and whup you and then sink you , and your wimmin and children 'd better start cryin ' now . You sure must a made them mad . Do n't you know better than to mess with keelers ? One of ' em is Rocker Dan , and I guess everyone knows he 's kilt plenty men . Goodbye . See you in the graveyard . " The most senseless part of this senseless affair to Lucy was that ,  | with all the trouble of having to take advantage of every current to keep ahead of the keel , of having to use the sweeps often , of not being able to stop to fish or hunt , and even rarely for fresh water , on all the next days , as they counted up their defenses ? their irritation did not boil up around Mo Gansey , who had brought it on them . It swirled slightly around Mr. Valentine , for obviously being of no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not betraying any fear , and just continuing his drawing . " ' Course them two 'll jist run off with the wimmin and hide ! " " Maybe a good thing for all of you to do , " N'omi said . That evening at dusk the river turned north and west . Now the state of Kentucky was on their left , Ohio on their right . " I 'd ruther push on , " the steersman said , " but they 's no moon to see with . We 'll go up that crick under them pawpaws , and hope they 'll pass us in the night . " Though the next day was sultry , no stops were allowed for hunting or fresh water . Voices became sharper , faces irritable . Once , looking back , they saw the keel , a red dress moving high on deck . It had come into a long straight stretch they were just leaving . The keelers saw them too , and raised fists . " Just pray no breeze comes so they can hist a sail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We kin keep goin ' tonight for it 'll be moony . Everybody 'll have to keep a sharp eye for sawyers and planters . " When at dawn they tied up in a creek to beg fresh water from a squatter , Lucy saw her first Kentuckian , pasty-faced from ague , his sallow dirty-faced children around him . But a long sigh of relief went up , when through overhanging walnut and willows in the creek , they saw the keel go on down the river . " Onless , " some worrier said , " they seen us , and ' 11 wait and catch us below . Maysville next . They 're bound to tie up there . " When the flatboat approached Maysville , they saw the deserted keel , its men probably in the grog shop on the wharf . Silently , nervously , the flatboat men floated past . On the evening of the ninth day , they made Cincinnati , but tied up a safe mile or two beyond . On the tenth day , in a thunderstorm , wind blew them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared , they were able to tie up near  | a long spit on the Kentucky side . N'omi , looking beyond the spit and the canebrake to a lush green bottom , said , " There 'll be dandelions there . I 'm goin ' to pick a mess for Mrs. Carmarthan . It 'll do her good to get some sass . " Emma Gansey said , " I would n't mind some greens myself . I 'll go , too . " The two blue sunbonnets bobbed about for a time in the briars , then disappeared behind the canebrake . River-washed cottonwood trees were gauntly silhouetted on the long spit . As the men on the flatboat watched , a bear rose up on its hind legs , stood a moment , then began to claw one of the trees . " A b'ar ! Them wimmin are in the cane ! Yell to ' em to git on out of there ! " " Wait ! They may be t' other side of the spit . Do n't yell at them ! " " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle , and now he excitedly fired . The bear dropped on all fours , head down , thrashing about , evidently hit , but  --  moved ahead toward the canebrake . " Them wimmin 's in the cane ! If they meet up with that wounded b'ar " That rifle 's shot 'll bring ' em out . " " No , they 'll think we 're shootin ' turkeys . " Mr. Gansey raised his rifle again . One of the boatmen had run for his . Audubon appeared with his rifle , and his voice had a note Lucy had never heard before : stern , imperious . " No one shoot ! If you miss again , he is even more dangerous . Stand quiet ! " Astonishingly enough , at the authoritative ring in his voice , they remained motionless , almost in relief at someone 's assuming command . Audubon waited , with rifle raised , eye on the movement in the cane , moving the gun as the bear moved . There ! Between the cottonwood and the cane . The rifle cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half into the lapping river , sprawled motionless . The men looked at each other , at him , but did not say a word . They are too small-souled to thank him , Lucy thought . Only Gran'paw said , " A good shot , and him thrashin ' around . " Audubon wiped his rod . " In France , my friend , we starch up our ruffles , take a flute in one hand , a rifle in the other , climb into  | our fiacre and we shoot wildcats out the back as we ride . " His face was perfectly calm . Emma and N'omi appeared beyond the cane brake , both mouths going . They had evidently never stopped talking . " Wait 'll ' em wimmin find out they like to been clawed by a wounded b'ar . " No one had even glanced at the creek mouth behind them . The keel boat had come into it . There were panic shouts , but Audubon continued to wipe his rod . " There 's ten of ' em , ready to gouge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have here women and infants . These men must not board this flatboat . " " Who 's goin ' to stop ' em ? " Lucy clung to his arm . " Please ! This is not our world . At the next town , we must leave this boat ! Father would say it is the thing to do . Do n't allow them to draw you in ! " He loosened her hand gently . By now the keelers were jumping ashore , running toward the flatboat . As the steersman grabbed a pole , the others whatever was handy , Audubon said , " You do not wish to fight these men , is it not so ? " " And leave everyone stretched cold ? There 'd not be a eye or a tooth left . " " You must allow me , then , to speak . All be silent . " Shaking fists , screaming curses and threats , the keelers approached . " My Lucy , go below and remain . The other ladies , please , also . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her . Below , they crowded at a porthole . Lucy could not bear to look , but she could not help hearing a coarse voice yell , " C'm on , you lousy flatters ! Git off and git the whuppin ' you desarve , or we 'll come and git you ! " N'omi breathed , frightened , " There goes Otterbun , alone , down the gangplank . " Lucy heard his voice , " Is there a gentleman who will stand up with me , alone , for a duel ? " She heard the roars of laughter . " Rocker , split ' im apart wit ' yore thumb like a inseck ! " " Naw , let 's give Shorty a chance . He never has no fun . "  | " T'anks , Rocker ! " " As the challenger , monsieur , I name the weapon . Rifle ! " " Shootin ' ! Look out , Shorty . It 's a trick . " " If one of you can beat me at driving the nail at thirty paces , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a bloodthirsty yell . She began to cry . " They 're measurin ' ! " N'omi cried . ' Usin ' that gum tree . " In a few minutes , a rifle shot cracked , then another . Lucy waited , agonized . Finally , N'omi cried out , " I cai n't rightly tell what happened . They 're walkin ' back . They 're measurin ' again . Oh , they 're makin ' it longer . Must be at forty paces . " There was a shot , then another . A shout rose , but this time it was not one of anger , more like the roar of excitement at a horse race , or a game . " They 're tnovin ' back again ! They 're tryin ' at fifty paces . Otterbun must 've sunk his nail and he keeps on lengthenin ' the distance . He 's right smart . Them keelers 'd stop anythin ' for a shootin ' match . Here , they 're all comin ' back now . " Lucy ran to the porthole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a huge bearded bandit . " Monsieur Rocker , shall it be three out of five ? The one who first misses two squirrels to stand the treat ? " " They 're goin ' to bark squirrels . Let 's all jist pray , " N'omi said . It was too much . Lucy backed away from the porthole , and put her hands over her ears as well . Why could it not have been one of the other husbands instead of hers ? I 've hardly had him at all . i lands clapped over her ears did not shut out the shots , the yelling . Then she felt N'omi 's hand on her shoulder . " It 's all right . He done it ! " Lucy , spirits reviving , ran to the porthole . The dreadful bandit Rocker had an arm around Audubon 's shoulder . " Come on over to a decent boat . We got some real whiskey . How come a shot like you gits mixed up with that scum on a flatboat ? " They were leading him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , was the woman in the red dress . They all disappeared into the cabin . From it , very soon , came sounds of merriment , of shouted songs of an indelicate nature . Now the ladies deemed it safe to go on deck . Waiting , Lucy  | could see the steersman blinking impatiently toward the keel , see his hands twitching through his beard . Then she heard him muttering to the others , " We ought to high-tail out of here while we kin . They git drunk , no tellin ' . " Lucy sprang forward . " But my husband is there ! " " It 's one man or the whole boat . " " You would n't leave him ! That 's dastardly ! " " Bastardy or not ! We 'll untie , sneak past to the crick mouth . Maybe by that time , he 'll git away . " " You ca n't ! You must wait ! " But with furtive haste , they made ready . Lucy cried and N'omi comforted , " Never mind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , they maneuvered past the keel . But the keelers heard , ran out . Audubon , too . " I come ! " The keelers did not try to stop him as he jumped on shore and ran along it . They cheered him drunkenly as he waded out and was pulled aboard the moving flatboat . The flatboat men used poles and sweeps to reach the current as fast as possible . Lucy ran to Audubon , flinging herself into his arms , sobbing , as he stood , panting and dripping . " What an ordeal for you ! ' " I should say it ! Terrible whiskey ! " They swung downriver , rapidly moving away from danger . The males on the flatboat gathered about him , crowding Lucy away . " ? that second shot . Never thought you 'd do it ! " " How about when Rocker missed that second squirrel ? " " A whiffle of breeze sprang up just then . " Audubon cried , " I was down-wind of Monsieur Rocker . This could put one off a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hearty as the others . Lucy blinked . The way he carries it off , one might almost think he enjoyed it . Then an astonishing thought came . Perhaps he had . That afternoon , when Nev Gansey , tossing a ball in the air , let it bounce too near Audubon as he sat drawing , Mr. Gansey cuffed him , with , " Mind where you 're playin ' . Ca n't you see Mr. Odderbun 's working ? " But Lucy 's eyes really widened after supper ,  | when one of the boatmen lifted his grog , crying , " I say we drink to Odderbun , the best durn shot on the Easy Go ! " and all , even Mo Gansey , with a shouted " Yea ! " drank . Even so early in the morning , mist rising through dense-leaved catalpas had a golden shimmer . Gran'paw Keefer came on deck where Lucy stood alone awaiting Audubon . Hearing an unfamiliar bird at daybreak , he had gone ashore . A wading blue heron cast a shadow longer than the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , K-paw ! " Audubon returned , greeting Gran'paw with , " You rise up early . " " Yup . Jist the way you like to draw critters , I like to rise up early . I reckon I seen more light than any man alive . Mornings , ever since a lad , I seen it hit the rim of the world . Evenin 's , when I was on the farm , I 'd see the last of it , all purple on the milk pail , or tippin ' the high trees , wagonin ' in the mountains . Some men , they had the most girls , and they 're purty in their pink ginghams . Some go to Congress or git elected President . But I reckon I seen more light than any man alive . " Audubon was not listening . A bird , enormous-winged , flew over , high up . " An eagle ! I 've seen one now many times , far off . Someday , I 'll see him close . " " Nobody gits familiar with an eagle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed them back , this day a fresh wind moved with the current through blue-green sunsaturated valleys . " We 're gittin ' south , " a boatman said . Shores were softened by aquatic plants , and meadows blue with lupine . In the white-washed sheds of settlements , yellow leaves of tobacco hung drying . At a fording place , they saw wagons crossing , and in a pool for horses to drink , an enormous flock of wood ducks . Once they heard water falling and passed a white cascade tumbling into the river , but mostly they moved through silent reflections of dark green hills where catbirds called . There seemed a pearliness , a translucence in the air . N'omi said , " This 'd be a fine day for the new babe to come on deck . Sun ai n't too hot . Martin 's finished the cradle , too . "  | " I used half a whiskey keg , which may smell some , " Martin brought it , " but the wood 's aged . " Two of the staves made its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her foot , rocked her in the new cradle . After a while she fetched her zither , and strumming it idly , began to hum . Then her husky voice found words : " Driftin ' , driftin' ' , Slidin ' over ripples , Sunlight drippin ' , willows liftin ' , Leavin ' all behind . We 'll be there someday , Never mind when , The river takes you , That 's God 's plan . " With luck , the flatboat would make Louisville tomorrow night . Now when the boatmen rowed on bends , they sang : " Pull away down , To Louaville town . " Lucy went forward , her eyes straining downriver , almost as though she might see it . I 'll know no one . No , that 's not true . Rozier . Her spirits sank a little . There are many other French there , too . With the war , what if they 're prejudiced against English people ? And Madame Berthoud that Laforest talks of , admires , so much . If she were really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know she 's the Marquise de Saint Pie , former lady in waiting to Marie Antoinette . And she 'll see how inexperienced , how ignorant I am . As the afternoon wore on , someone suggested , " We ought to have a play-frolic tonight , to celebrate . " The idea grew tall , sprouted wings , and at the next crossing , a hunting party took off to shoot turkeys for a feast . And Lucy did not miss the new note in the voices which begged , " Come along , Otterbun , we do n't want to come back empty-handed . " When the hunters departed , N'omi assumed command of the  | preparations . Emma buzzed about , and Mrs. Carmarthan , on deck now , tried vaguely to help . Lucy offered . But it was plain N'omi , setting up kegs with planks over them for a table , tolerated them Iike children underfoot . By evening they came to the mouth of the Kentucky River , flowing into the Ohio , clear and green . It had been arranged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would join them here . Now when they tied up , they no longer shunned the customary stopping-place , but eagerly sought the company of flatboats , canoes , pirogues . There were keels tied up , too , but like someone not quite over a scare , they tied as far away from them as they could . Seeing a meadow full of gold flowers , Lucy fetched armfuls , stuck them in emptied whiskey jugs to hide the raw planks of the table . When Emma said , " Who put them nuisancy mustard weeds all over ? " N'omi hushed her , " I think of vittles and drink , but they look kind of pretty and delicate like Mrs. Otterbun . Leave them . " Henrietta motioned Lucy with mysterious beck to a deserted spot on the boat . " We felt  --  my husband and I  --  in kindness we ought to speak to you . We understand you 've but recently come to America and might not realize . It 's most unwise , and quite unnecessary , to lend your presence to this affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , I 've been told , a quite nice society there . What would such persons think if it were known you danced and consorted with these low roughs ? In order not to be drawn in , we plan to go ashore for a long walk . We 'd be glad to have you accompany us . " " Thank you . I do n't know what to say . These people , they ? Well , I 'll have to consider what 's best to do . I 'll let you know . " When Henrietta moved off , eyes carefully averted from the party preparations , Lucy stood undecided . For my husband 's sake , I want to be accepted in Louisville . For my own , too . Everything will be pleasanter . She thought of the unknown Marquise de Saint Pie . Then she thought of her fellow passengers  --  of Mrs. Gansey , of  | her sons , Mo and Nev . Would such people be invited , say , to a small dance at Fatland ? And tonight , there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing with a bear ! She could not forget the senseless violence , the noisome hold , sloven speech , floating corpses . But she also thought of wild grapes at sunset , and N'omi playing the zither and Gran'paw boasting he 'd seen more light than any man alive . The trouble is , she thought , everything that 's happened has grown into me now , whether I like it or not , and what I do next seems to want to come out of that . If only I could talk to Father about it . She saw moving figures  --  the hunters returning . Audubon , in the lead , waved to her . She smiled , remembering when the women had been menaced by the bear , his voice and eyes when he took command . All at once she seemed to be many miles back on this journey ? when she had first seen the gray wall of mountain blocking the west . She remembered she had been unable to find a track showing how to cross . But they had crossed . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain . There was a track over it , though  --  faint , never before used . Her mind started boldly up the new track . Why do I keep asking what Father would do ? I 'll talk it over with my husband ! She had a dim realization she 'd come not only the thousand miles  --  climbing Tuscarora and Allegheny , swirling down chutes , poling through shoals and riffles  --  but other distances , vast also . She said out loud , " I 'll ask my husband what he thinks . " Amid the rejoicing over the hunters ' booty , Audubon said , " If there 's dancing and music  --  I 'll be there ! " If once or twice as the feast went on at the long plank tables , the manners were a little surprising , Lucy smiled , thinking , I guess it was like this in the hall of a baron in the twelfth century . When the music began , guests came . Now they learned the bearded men in deerskin shirts from the half-acre raft of swamp pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper reaches  | of the Allegheny River . The ark on the other side of them had come from the Cumberland . And one of the boatmen recognized the old-young man , darkly weathered , from the canoe loaded with furs . " Why , it 's Daniel Boond 's nephew ! " A keel boat , up from Orleans with twenty tons of sugar and cotton , warped in before the evening was old . When the keel-boat men joined them , the people on the Easy Go smiled ingratiatingly , as mice might if cats came to their party , and hoped the Monongahela pleased  --  and lasted . To her delight Lucy found a ring game they played , called " Go In and Out the Window , " was like a game she 'd seen beside the Gothic bridge in Bakewell . When Audubon blew on his flute , a gay air , the Canadian-French boatmen danced but , when Gran'paw fiddled , the dancing really began . The set was remarkably like an English reel . When Audubon took her hands , Lucy sprang up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the set , the odor overpowering  --  but she only laughed . N'omi , moving with surprising grace , swung wide , her linseywoolsey skirt billowing like a sail , her little husband Martin treading precisely . Emma Gansey fluttered about uneasily as her sons pursued the two daughters , like plump pullets , from the ark . She pronounced loudly , a Cassandra in a sunbonnet , " Dancing 's sinful ! " Finally , retreating before stronger forces , she waited for a quiet moment to cry out , " I 'm goin ' below to pray ! " But the dancing feet over her head , unceasing , must have prevented her orisons from getting through . No one inquired for Mr. and Mrs. Harold Valentine . By moonset , the fiddle and flute were silent . Above the frog chorus from the bottoms , giggles and whispers sounded from dark corners . The water lapped against the boat as the eyes of foxes gleamed in the forest . Next morning , the twelfth day , they left the Kentucky River mouth and came into a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating in a strong current . They were almost there ; overhead ,  | the vast open sky seemed the only enclosure bounding the forest , unpeopled , neither threatening , nor welcoming . Lucy watched the swift-passing oaks and maples . For some reason her mind flashed back to an English greensward encircled by hundred-year-old box , then to an English meadow tightly fenced ; a garden , walled in ; a field enclosed by high hedgerows ; and she could see signs everywhere ? " No Trespassing , " " Beware of the Dog , " " Keep Out . " But here , all was loose and large . One could not see the rim of it . One must stretch , unwind , uncramp to fit . By noon , they 'd come to Dead Man 's Island , with a dangerous bar . The cry " Riffle ahead ! " sounded . The boatmen pulled hard to make the crossing . Here they were , at Eighteen-Mile Island with its rocks . Again , there was hard work at the sweeps . They rested , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel , they said . Twelve-Mile Island passed , and then , as the afternoon wore on , Six-Mile Island dead ahead . The snags around Goose Island must be outmaneuvered , but after that , they had an easy time of it for four miles . They came then to the final obstacle , a sand-bar almost across the mile-wide river . But now , Lucy did not worry at sight of snag or rock or shoal . She smiled , thinking , These men are dirty , coarse , profane , but strong and clever , too . They 'll get us past somehow . That steersman  --  he 's always vaguely reminded me of someone . Why , I believe it 's Chaucer 's Miller , on his way to Canterbury ! They came into the last reach . A mile ahead , a few evening lights winked in a cluster of houses and spires . " Louaville ! " Emma cried out . Mrs. Carmarthan burst into tears . " Somehow , I knew we 'd make it . And here we 're bringin ' a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that life behind us we like never to see again . " On deck the passengers stood silent now . Then one said , " They have to watch smart here to land at Beargrass Creek . Otherwise we could be drawn into one of the chutes and go over the Falls . " The boatmen pulled hard for the left shore . With cleverness and strength , the awkward twenty tons of hammered-together planks ,  | holding fifteen souls about to disperse to start new lives , was propelled into Beargrass Creek in the twilight , passing other arks and keels with their lanterns swinging , and came to rest . " I feel like to pray , " N'omi said . " Seven hundred miles we floated on that river . And we 're here . We was in God 's hands . "  | Part Three CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE AUDUBONS RODE with young Nicholas Berthoud in his phaeton . They were going to the Berthouds ' in nearby Shippingport , to help celebrate the name day of Madame , his mother , the former Marquise de Saint Pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriages in the Louisville street . He had called first for Audubon at the store , then had come for Lucy at the Tavern of the Indian Queen . She 'd had no moment alone with her husband . But she would manage , somehow or other , as soon as they arrived , to tell him . Too excited by her news to lean back into the deep cushions , she looked instead at the sky . How could it be so warm in October ? This smoky-gold time was called , here in Kentucky , Indian summer . Was it called so because the Indians , like the season , had aspects of the unbe-lievable ? They were passing the wharf . She said , " How different everything is from when we landed there off the flatboat last spring . " She felt vastly different , even from yesterday , now that she knew . Shouts sounded from behind them . With a laugh , Nicholas pulled to one side . Two horses , lashed on , were followed by a yelling crowd . " A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it could stop this town from racing in the streets ! "  | On walls , and in store windows , signs announced : " Beautiful Full-bred Roan will cover Mares at Eight Dollars the season , Payment accepted in Hemp , Linen or Salt , " or : " Twelve Dollars to insure Mare with Foal . Four Dollars the Single Leap , paid at the Stable Door . " Lucy thought that in Philadelphia the air seemed full of the rustle of money ; in Pittsburgh , of the sulphurous fumes from furnaces of iron and glass . In Louisville it resounded with the beat of horses ' hooves . Trotting on , they passed Brodhead 's fine large store , and after a few minutes , a one-story frame , its single window lettered " Audubon &; Rozier , General Merchandise . " In the open country , dust rose from their wheels , settling on scarlet oaks . She breathed an acrid odor from mysterious fires , part of this unbelievable season . But it was n't only the Indian summer light glinting over the tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her she 'd had no chance to tell of . She 'd had this sense of pleasant unreality ever since they 'd come , been accepted , even hailed , into the gaiety , the riding and the dancing . Now after six months , they still lived at the Tavern of the Indian Queen , but it had not mattered , because so much of their time was spent in festivity at the clustering plantations . They came at last to the Berthoud house . Its graceful white front and green shutters sparkled improbably against the untracked forest behind it , and it seemed only part of the fantasy that , inside , a liveried Negro piled fruit in a silver epergne on a long mahogany table . But Madame Berthoud , black hair drawn back above a large aquiline nose , greeting them with spontaneous affection , was real enough . " How much good it does me to see you both ! " Her deep eyelids were like hoods shading tragic black eyes . Still holding Audubon 's hand she said , " You , I will seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will please you , eh ? We will not wait dinner for Mr. Henry Clay . He will come in later . " Lucy could not contrive a moment alone with her husband , for dinner was announced . The lace tablecloth , cherished from  | Madame 's household when she had been Dame d'Honneur to Marie Antoinette , was mended , but the silver candlesticks glowed . It seemed no more fantastic to be served here on the edge of the wilderness with canard supreme Montmorency , than to hear the chatter of the young ladies , breathless with news from Virginia . " Bonnets must have high crowns ? ! " Nor more fantastic to hear Nicholas ' father , the former Marquis , lean forward to ask in the soft-toned English acquired from his eighteen years ' association with Virginia-born neighbors , " Tell me , Mr. Gilly , this tobacco they call  --  the plug . What is done with it then ? " " Chew . They chew it , " Mr. Fortunatus Gilly said . " It 'll empty that warehouse of yours quicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a man 's traveling , sometimes he 'd best not make a light , or even sneeze . But he can always chew . " By dessert , Madame Berthoud , delicately peeling a large plum , was saying to Major Croghan , " Without inherited classes , men here are held together only by private interests . But their interests may change almost overnight . Rich today , poor tomorrow . These unhappy Americans ! They seem outgoing , friendly . But they 're isolated , with all the loneliness that goes with that . " Mr. Tarascon gently twirled his Madeira in the chased goblet . " I wonder at this , too . Here , lip service is paid to individual difference . In reality there is one over-all pattern , like something stamped in lead . To anyone who does not conform , woe . Truly , I would not wish to live in France again . Yet , in honesty , I must remark there seemed more chance for strange variations there . " Lucy heard General Clark , at the other end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't worked . We may well have to push the British back into Canada . " This General Jonathan Clark was brother to a Clark who had made some expedition much talked of . " If there 's war , we must have better maps of the Northwest , and that means another expedition . " " General , " Audubon leaned toward him eagerly , " if a man could shoot , carry a portage , make drawings , would he not be useful on such an expedition ? " The general nodded .  | At that moment , Audubon glanced toward Lucy . If only she 'd had a moment to speak . If only he knew . Even after dinner she had no chance . Among all the French colony who came to wish Madame happy returns was Ferdinand Rozier , and Rozier moved quickly to Audubon . " A letter has just come ! " Rozier said . " From Kinder &; Company of New York . They wish an immediate inventory . We must go at once and make this . " " Leave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should show our creditors we tend to business ! " The harpsichord tinkled and Rozier drew a deep breath , as though knowing it signaled defeat . " Tomorrow morning , then , without fail ! " He left . Deftly , Audubon 's hand led her into the minuet . The charming light tinkle of the music seemed part of the hazy feeling of Indian summer unreality . It seemed part of it , too , that it should be during the pause between one step and the next , she should be saying , " It 's true ! What we hoped ! I learned it from Dr. Galt this morning ! " His eyes widened with delight . And it seemed part of the fantasy that neither missed a step , but moved on in the dance . " I thought I had with thee all the happiness there was ! But this , too ! I am proud . I wish to tell everyone ! " She shook her head , smiling . Under the candlelight , the stately dance flowed on . Between figures Nicholas Berthoud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw two red-shouldered hawks in our river timber . You and Lucy stay tonight . In the morning , Pompey will take us there . " Uneasily , Lucy remembered Rozier . Then the harpsichord tinkled , a new figure began . Surely , even Rozier would understand her husband could not miss a red-shouldered hawk . The Indian Queen , owned by a Virginia gentleman named John Gwathmay , was the best tavern in Louisville . But the only running water was in the courtyard . Lucy filled their bottle and carried it and her son toward their chamber , passing through the stale smoke  | of the news room , into the dark hall , where the dinner bell split the air . Boatmen , settlers and cotton traders stampeded , bowling over the drunken . Lucy turned to the wall to protect the baby . When Lucy reached their own chamber , she sat on the bed , still trembling . The tinkle of the harpsichord , in the five weeks since her confinement , had become very faint . She had become more familiar with the thump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion of cursing in the barroom . She thought , as she had often of late , we can not live in the tavern any longer . We must have a place of our own . She had seen a cottage on Third Street , empty and for sale . She sighed . Their income was not too dear to her , except that they could have used more . But , she thought , there 's my dower . Father never meant me to come emptyhanded . We might even have a garden behind that cottage ! Her son , christened that morning and still wearing his robe , was asleep . She put him in the cradle . A Negress belonging to Mr. Gwathmay came in . " Oh , Addie , we 've invited friends this afternoon . It will be a help if you attend the baby . " " Look at that fine boy . What his name be ? " " Victor Gifford Audubon . " Lucy put on her white mull wedding dress , smoothed her hair , and hurried toward the banquet room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banner still pleaded " Vote for Madison . " A christening party in a public tavern was not quite what one might wish . But soon they 'd have a house of their own . Prdinard Rozier , his face red and angry , stood beside her husband , near a table loaded with cold meats , jellies , pastries . Rozier thrust out a letter . " Read it yourself then ! Our notes are called . I warned you ! From our trade here we should have saved ! There has been too much drawing out for expenses ! " Lucy drew in a sharp breath and looked quickly at her husband . He frowned at Rozier . " We have not taken more than our half . " " Naturally not ! " Rozier sounded shocked as if it would be the final insult for anyone to think he would have permitted such a thing . " But what has the firm accumulated to pay off these notes ? As for me , I live in the chamber next the hostler . I do not have  | the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal note to Huron &; Co. , in Philadelphia . But then , I do not have parties . " " When one has christened a son , " Audubon said , " one may have friends to drink wine ! " Rozier picked up a bottle from the table , his eyes gloomy . " But ? the imported ? " " These people have entertained us many days in their houses . " Better , perhaps , if there had not been so many of these friends . Even Madame Audubon must agree I have toiled and worried behind the counter always . Can we pay Kinder with friends , or drawings of birds ? " " I 'll take orders for portraits , " Audubon cried . " Remember I have been a pupil of David ! " " You fool ! " Rozier shouted . " You know we owe Kinder nearly eight thousand dollars ! " In the shattering silence , all wisps of golden Indian summer haze , all the echoing tinkle of harpsichords that had filled pleasant unreal days , vanished . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid , what then ? " " It is the end for us , " Rozier groaned . " They may even collect on anything we earn in future . " They could hear the guests arriving . Rozier said , " Pardon me , I can not stay . I am ill of shame . If it should come to my father 's ears that I , his son , could not meet my obligations ! " For an instant Lucy gazed into his eyes and was shocked by the anguish in them . " When our guests have gone , " Audubon said , " we will talk of this . We do not give up so easily . " Lucy greeted her guests , accepted congratulations , but her mind circled , grasping at straws . What if ? Would it be possible ? ? Finally , the last toast was drunk . Back in their own chamber , alone , with Victor in his cradle , they clung to each other . " My Lucy , I should not have allowed this to happen . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek help from my father . Rozier heard lately through his family my father 's affairs do not prosper . "  | There was a silence . Then she said , " Would it help if I returned and lived at Fatland ? I know my expenses have been added . And now , Victor 's . " " My Lucy ! " he cried out . " What can we do ? If Kinder forecloses and you can not carry on business , we would have no income . " " I have had no time to consider where to turn . " " I have been lately thinking  --  but for another reason  --  my portion of Fatland might be realized . " " Oh , but ? " " My father never intended I should come empty-handed . " " It is true , he spoke to me of this once . " " We must be sensible . Better meet difficulties here and try to salvage what has gone into the business already . " That is true . " " If this debt were paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . " And without paying interest ? " " But thy father , would he agree ? " " If it seems sensible to him , he will . Besides , he 'll surely realize his grandson brings expenses . " " It would be a help even for Kinder to know we 're trying to raise the money . " " A letter takes so long to reach there , I ought to write at once . " She sat at the little table , picked up the quill and wrote : My dear Father : We have a great favor to ask ... . She hesitated . Into her mind came a vivid image of the cottage on Third Street , empty and for sale . She glanced up and met her husband 's tender , luminous eyes . The cottage could be postponed ! In the meantime , they had each other and a wonderful son . They were together . Now she wrote with a steady hand : It appears that Kinder Company , the merchants of New York , are demanding .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the muddy street . Mail had arrived . Victor , at nine months , could be left with Addie at the tavern . In the store she found only Rozier behind the counter . He drew his shoulders into a high shrug . " Your husband went to the post office , but he took his gun and no doubt will go by way of the Silver Hills , five miles away . " She sat behind her husband 's table to wait . Time had nagged their heels these past months . Mr. Bakewell had written Kinder &; Company , assuring them the money was in prospect , but the Fatland acreage considered Lucy 's marriage portion must be surveyed , valued and sold . Finally , Kinder set a date . It was impossible not to be anxious now that this date drew close . On her husband 's table , among the keel-boat freightage bills and invoices , she saw the corner of a sheet of drawing paper . She moved some bills and was looking at the sparkling clarity of a drawing of the hooded merganser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defensively , her hand stroked the leathery white drawing paper . Then Audubon burst into the store . " A letter from Fatland ! " They read : A buyer is now found , but he offers notes and realty instead of cash . He attempts to raise specie . If he succeeds , the transaction may be concluded in a few weeks ... . Rozier sat down heavily . " A few weeks ! " He looked at Audubon . " The time has come for decisions . Today , we go over the books , list all who owe us . Should we attempt a credit with Huron ? " The door opened quickly and a slight man with graying hair , in  | a shabby coat of foreign cut , came in . Hopefully , Rozier went forward with " May I serve you , sir ? " Then Rozier saw the visitor 's freight  --  two books , thick and red-bound . The stranger , in the clipped syllables of a Scot , said , " I am interested in gaining your subscription to my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He opened the books on the counter . Rozier made a brusque gesture , but Audubon sprang forward , his eyes magnetized to the pages . " Birds ! A book of birds ! " The visitor smoothed down the title page , " As you see , my name is Wilson , Alexander Wilson . The plates were engraved in Philadelphia , all hand-colored ? " " We have no time ! " Rozier broke in , but Audubon turned the pages avidly . " My Lucy , look ! " Wilson turned to Audubon . " I am engaged in collecting and figuring all the birds of this country . If I obtain enough subscriptions , my work may run to ten volumes . " " My Lucy , do you hear ? Sir , I am amazed , delighted , that such a work goes on ! " Rozier groaned . A creased , finger-marked paper , the subscription list , was drawn from the visitor 's coat . " Then you will subscribe ? " Audubon seized the quill . " Sir , such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hand down on the counter so that the inkwell jumped . " Audubon ! You fool ! You probably have more bird pictures than he has , and as good ! " Wilson stared bleakly at Audubon 's quill poised in the air , his eyes following it reluctantly as it was finally placed back on the counter . Lucy , seeing Wilson 's broken boots and gnarled hands , thought what a miserable life he led , furnishing not only the matter for his books but having to knock on doors , to procure the means of publishing them . For a moment , she was almost sorry Audubon had not subscribed . Audubon 's eyes were eager . " It is true , sir , I have a large collection . Would you care to see them ? " Wilson looked sour but shrugged . " If it pleases you to show them . "  | " But not now ! " Rozier broke out . Audubon was already dragging the heavy portfolio from behind the jugs of whiskey and bags of salt . He opened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawing . Then another , and another . He looked stunned . Finally he said , " How many have you ? " " Nearly two hundred , " Audubon said . " Sir , observe this orchard oriole . In yours , the feathering of the tail differs . " " I never make errors . " " Perhaps it was the specimen you used . " Tight-lipped , Wilson stared at the drawings . " Is it your intention to publish ? " " Publish ? Do you hear that , Lucy ? " Audubon , smiling , pleased , shook his head . " No . They are done for the love , the fascination . If you find here any birds you have not yet figured , I am most happy to let you copy them . " " Audubon , for the last time ! " Rozier cried , but Wilson , turning the pages , said , " This one is wrongly colored . I 've seen stuffed specimens . The bird is white . " " The whooping crane ? Ah , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flecks on the feathers . " Audubon started from behind the counter . " Come ! With any luck , we 'll find you one ! " " Audubon ! No ! We ought to be deciding . " Rozier 's face reddened in anger . " An ornithologist does not pass our way every day . This wo n't take long . I must help . " The door closed behind them . On her way back to the tavern , Lucy , without realizing where her steps were taking her , passed the empty cottage on Third Street . But , if the specie came through on time , the business here might take on a new lease of life . Then we 'll have a place of our own ! This is only a postponement . A few days later , a trading party from Philadelphia came in , carrying private letters , one from Lucy 's father . Rozier brought it to them at the tavern . They learned that the eighty acres had been sold for cash and the Pennsylvania bank had sent a draft to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , nine hundred and eighty-six dollars . It was suggested that Lucy sign a document releasing her dower in the estate in order to keep its title clear . As she read the letter she was no longer at the Indian Queen ; instead , she was back at Fatland , seeing her father as he sat at his desk writing to her . Then Audubon touched her hand . " My Lucy , what dost thou think of this ? " " I 'm sorry . What were you saying ? " " Madame Audubon may not realize , " Rozier said in his somber voice , " our business here is not what we counted on . One reason is competition . Brodhead 's store we knew of , but the four started since ! Too many ! All suffer . " " And the question is , " Audubon said , " would it not be better to move on to a newer town ? " " But we 've just begun to put down roots ! " Rozier said , " We should go where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . One of the French settlements on the upper Mississippi . " " Excuse me , " her voice did not betray her . " I must care for Victor . " By holding herself erectly and walking quickly , she managed to get out of the public news room without the disgrace of tears . Her dower , then , was not to bring a home closer . Lucy left Victor with Addie . She had to go outside , to walk . Then she realized where her steps were taking her . Of all times , this was not the moment to look at the cottage . A carriage pulled up beside her and she heard Madame Berthoud 's voice . " Lucy ! Come , ride with me a little way . " Looking at Lucy on the opposite seat , Madame said , " Always sensible and serene , but now a storm . Do you wish to speak of it ? " Lucy waited to be sure her voice would not break . " My husband talks of moving on . To some place wilder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . She said , " Yes , it is difficult . When we fled France , barely in time , Quebec was crude , provincial . But I could have been happy . I tried to put down roots , make a home . But no . We left in a long , open boat  --  do I not remember  | it ? Down winding rivers . Winter overtook us . Bitter cold it was , even in furs . A child is buried beside one of those rivers . Finally , we came to Pittsburgh . My husband dropped his title , took the name of his former secretary , James Berthoud . As plain Berthouds , we began again , in the frontier log-huts of Pittsburgh . I tried to build a life . But no . Move on . Down the river . Pull up , go on . In Cincinnati we stopped . Only a few roots that time . Go on . A countryman , Tarascon , had gone to Louisville . We followed . And here , finally , at rest . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alighted . Madame reached out and touched Lucy 's cheek . " I should like to tell you , my young friend , of a trick I learned . Each time  --  I made myself believe the next place would be our home . " Lucy watched the carriage go . She is telling me a woman must follow . I 'll go ! But I do n't want to ! Angry energy carried her along toward the falls , tumbling , cascading toward the Mississippi . Often she and her husband had come here , he to draw , she to read or sew . The sound of the water , pushing pebbles and logs , had always soothed her . She remembered the day he had found the chimney swallow here . Now once again the sound of the water quieted her . Madame was reminding me that for all women it is the same . Lucy sighed . The sun was lower over the river . Perhaps only now I begin to understand how my mother felt at being jerked up . Lucy stared at the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint splashing . It became the sound of the water in the fountain behind the yews in the garden at Crith . She seemed to hear her mother weeping . She put her hands over her ears , as if to shut out another sound . But the sound , a voice persisted  --  the precise , aged voice of Aunt Gifford saying , " It is not enough for a woman to say with her lips , Whither thou goest .. : Lucy wanted to escape from there . She almost ran toward the tavern . Hurrying down the hall , she could hear Victor squalling angrily . She picked him up , unfastening her dress . Abused sobs subsided . She held him , warm and lovely . The waves inside her were calmer now .  | Her husband came in . He kissed her as she nursed the child . When the infant fell asleep , she placed him in the cradle . As she stood looking down at him , her husband came and put his arm around her . " No other woman in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing there , she thought , I must not go as my mother did , with eyes looking backward through tears . She put the coverlet gently over the child . Her husband said , " Come , sit with me , my Lucy . " When she was sitting near him he said , " Nothing will be done unless it pleases thee . All I ask is consideration with an open mind . There was in this week 's Kentucke Gazette an article of interest . " Ic took the small folded newssheet from his coat pocket . " It speaks of a settlement . Not French . Rozier may not like that , but , " he indicated the column of splayed , fuzzy print , " look . " She read : The settlement at Henderson , a hundred twenty miles down the Ohio on the Kentucky side , recommends itself to newcomers . The land agent , General Samuel Hopkins , one of I ! , Washington 's officers , is a most estimable gentleman . He has had a surveyor lay out a fine town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned town ? Her father had often spoken of such a possibility . The streets are to be a hundred feet wide . Space is allotted for a splendid central park , as well as schools and churches ... . " They allow space for churches and schools ! " she said . " It was k of these I dreaded for Victor . " She read on : It is expected many of the officers in General Hopkins ' old command will settle there , Carolinian and Virginia gentry .. . " Virginians , " she said . " I feel much in common with people of at background here in Louisville . I feel at home with them . " is word chimed in her mind  --  home . I tome . The place , vague , but bright , in that " someday " the moiling folks waiting for flatboats in the mud of the Pittsburgh wharf dreamed of . For some reason she thought of N'omi Keefer  | on the flatboat . She seemed to hear N'omi admonishing , " Fine reach around the bend , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay stuck on a towhead . " Home . What is it I really want ? To begin to make a family life . My husband is right . In such a place as that , we would not have to postpone but might have this life at once . The promised land , the vague , bright " someday " seemed suddenly near . She smiled . Audubon said , " The idea begins to please thee ? " She nodded . Streets a hundred feet wide . CHAPTER SEVENTEEN AUDUBON TENDERLY LOOKED down at his son . Victor kicked and gurgled on the mattress in the bottom of the skiff . " Three days and our Kentucky boy 's still lively ! " Shading the baby 's eyes with her parasol , Lucy said , " Your son is a traveled man . " A week ago , Rozier , loading their remaining stock from Louisville on a flatboat , had started ahead for Henderson . This skiff , with Negroes borrowed from the Berthouds rowing , was heavily laden . The boxes of silver , linen and china @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been used . Now , Lucy thought , they 'll find a home . Audubon shaded his eyes downriver at high red clay banks on the Kentucky side . One of the Negroes pointed , shouting , " Dar it be ! " They maneuvered out of the current and brought the boat into a small landing of grayed boards . Lucy could see ten or twelve log huts sprouting haphazardly from a burned-over clearing . She turned to one of the rowers . " How far inland is the town ? "  | " Dis be it . Dis be Henderson . " Audubon jumped on the landing . The rowers began to unload . Lucy sat as if her muscles and bones had come unhinged . Streets a hundred feet wide . The baby began to whimper . She picked him up . Her husband reached down for the child and she handed him ashore . Then she stepped up to the creaking boards . Carrying Victor , Audubon held a hand for her as they climbed up the slippery bank . Something moved at the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slouching man idled out of a bark cabin , cunning and curiosity on his yellow ague-ridden face , tobacco staining a ragged beard drifting over a greasy deerskin shirt . Virginia gentry . Audubon crossed to him . " Yup , that French fellah put his stuff there , " the man pointed to a log hut with a new padlock . " Sez he 's startin ' a store . Suits us . We need a groggery . No , ca n't say whar he 's went . Ev'body else is to camp meetin ' . That place over thar 's empty . Fellow that built it , his wife died on him , he lit out downriver . You mowt as well move in . " They crossed a field , rustling with high , dry weeds and briars , to a mud-calked cabin , bark still on its logs , stones missing from the chimney and greasy soil around the latchstring . Lucy followed her husband inside . From its one room and loft , odors assaulted her  --  from the musty earth floor , the dank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grease oiling the paper at the window , the animal skins in a heap on the bed . She stared at the bed . Tree forks pounded into the ground made two of its posts . On these , poles rested extending into chinks in the log wall . She touched a grimy table whose planks showed the axe marks of Its maker . The Negroes appeared at the door with one of her boxes . She had a fleeting image of heavy embossed silver , her father 's wedding gift , the embroidered linens , the Crith china . " Want us to put dis yar inside ? " She took a deep breath . " Please do . " Her husband looked about ruefully . " It is not very fine . " " Well , now , we ca n't expect to start in a palace . I must air and  | clean . It will make a difference . " And her fingers itched to be about it . Home . " Now , Victor , my fine boy , you will please not get into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildfowl feathers into ticks , said , " Here ! " and wafted a handful of down into the air . Chasing it kept Victor , fourteen months now , happy as Lucy stitched shut the pillow tick made of coarse fustian sold at their store . She moved across the cabin with happy lightness , stirring the stew on the kettle on the crane , tasting it , reaching up to the drying rack above the fireplace for a pinch of savory from the herbs hanging there . Some porridge from an iron pot went into a gourd dish bought from a passing Indian . While Victor ate porridge , she ironed the tartan frock she had made him . " Soon we 'll ride off to Dr. Rankin 's to meet your papa . We want him to be proud of you , do n't we ? " With the water pail , she passed through their dooryard garden , regretting , as always , she had not time to tend and weed it . The root of the rosebush , sent her from Fatland , showed only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bushes , ran to the brook and filled her pail . She waved to Betsy , the wife in a cabin a few hundred feet away . Betsy had buried a child only last week . But a new one was on the way . And Lucy could see the smoke smudge , too , where that young couple , recently landed from a barge , worked from dawn through torchlight , clearing stumps , fighting acres out of the cane . It was surprising what a powerful thing hope was . One did not move in one bound from the muddy wharf at Pittsburgh to that vague , bright , promised land . There were way stations . In a bark cabin , one dreamed of a log house , with glass windows , two or three rooms and a porch . And an orchard . Perhaps next year . She saw Rozier approaching the cabin . " Madame Audubon , have you seen the clerk ? " The partners had a young lad , Nat Pope , who knew the ways of game and fish almost as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might as well hire him out since he was always running after Audubon anyway . " He has gone with my husband to Dr. Rankin 's farm to hunt with young William Rankin . There 's no use complaining of that . How else would we eat ? " " It was necessary to take the clerk also ? No doubt to note the number of feathers in some bird 's tail . " When he had gone , Lucy hurried to saddle the horse , not so fine as those they had in Louisville . She placed a feather tick in front of the saddle where Victor would ride . Then she mounted with him and rode off . The hoofbeats rang on ground baked hard by late autumn . The trail led through a cane brake . The sun set and she rode faster as she passed the spot where a few months earlier a woman had been devoured by wolves . When she was still a long way from Meadowbrook , the doctor 's plantation , she could see the glow from the great fire in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not returned , but Mistress Sally Rankin , the doctor 's pretty young wife , his third , cried out delightedly . " Lucy ! Now do not think to go in less than two days . I will not part from you ! " Mistress Sally was already busily bearing the doctor his third set of children . Her gay gossip ran not only on the type of shawls seen on a last visit to Louisville , but , " Did you know the widow Gelb thinks of Rozier ? She 's free in her favors , too , but he 's so strait-laced , he wo n't take the opportunity . " Then they reached the really passionately important topics like a new pattern for a baby 's cap , the best month to wean infants , and stored-up crystals of wisdom beginning , " For colic , I always ? " Two days passed before the Audubons were allowed to leave . Audubon rode first , a deer slung behind on his horse . Lucy came next , smiling down at her son on his pillow . Nat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarums and excursions , into the woods . Sunlight filtered through the beech . It reminded Lucy vaguely of something she had n't thought of in a long time  --  a tapestry , graygreen , ancient , in the castle outside Bakewell , depicting a procession winding through mythical woods , a young man on a caparisoned  | horse , playing a flute , followed by his lady and retinue . The sound of her husband 's flute floated back like silver streamers . In Henderson , one could not only fish in the sunny river and hunt in the beautiful forest  --  one had time . Time to collect birds and make dozens of fine new drawings . Time to swim in the river with one 's delightful wife , to teach the most marvelous child that ever lived  --  one 's son  --  to paddle like a dog in the water . In the evening , under candles , time to sit playing the flute with one 's wife leaning against one 's shoulder . There was a store to tend , of course , but friends to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to inquire if any strange birds had been seen on remote branches . Now , Lucy opening the door of the store , heard Rozier 's voice . " Henderson was to be a trial only . " " But , " Audubon protested , " we make out well here . " " Well ! " Rozier scorned this . " What does one come to America for but to make a fortune ? I waste my capital . Now , at St. Genevieve ! All French there . A great advantage . But in addition , the habitants are workers in the lead mines . They are paid in cash , in gold . One would not be asked , as here , to take payment in a suckling pig . " Lucy had come in and Audubon put his arm around her . " But we are happy here ! " " I do not run off the track in silly arguments , " Rozier said stiffly . " If we had gone to a French settlement in the first place ... ! " He brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened it on the counter . " It says in our Articles of Association , here ... can not be prevented from engaging in any other kind of business after a trial of six months . ' Our fathers knew well that six months was time enough to see if a venture would be profitable enough . It is now six months . " Lucy sat frozen . To be uprooted again . Must she always keep saying , And follow thee , my lord ? But Audubon said , " I do n't want to drag my wife and son hither and yon ! "  | " And I do n't want to Ieave my capital here when I can make a larger profit elsewhere . At St. Genevieve we could make fifty percentum ! " The argument went on for weeks . At night , troubled , Audubon would say to Lucy , ' We are making out all right here now  --  but , if Rozier withdraws his capital and his business experience , what then ? " The next week Audubon was saying , " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . In matters of commerce , I am perhaps foolish not to listen to him . " Henderson , Rozier said , had been a trial . Now , he insisted on a trial for St. Genevieve . " The miners are paid in gold twice a year , once before Christmas . If we could go at once , before ice forms in the river . Fifty percentum . . . . " After a mild winter , with the rivers still open , it turned cold that December morning . Lucy stood on the landing , holding Victor tightly to keep him warm . Rozier , peering up at the gray sky , was already on the keel . The boat rode low . The partners were taking no luxurious trade goods like salt or hemp , but only plain necessities  --  three hundred barrels of Kentucky whiskey . Rozier , thinking of the miners ' Christmas money , refused to wait longer . Audubon jumped off the keel and ran back . She was in his arms . " I think I change my mind . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . " If things are happy there , as soon as we are settled , I 'll come or send for you . " Dr. Rankin , who was waiting for her , quieted one of his horses . " Knowing you are with the good Rankins , at least I will be easier in my mind . " He kissed her and turned to leap aboard as the boat moved into the river . Victor , in his little deerskin jacket , held out his arms , trying to catch the great feathery flakes , the first snow of the season . Snow swirled now . It cut off her view of Audubon waving from the top of the keel . She went toward the doctor 's surrey . " Sally 's waiting for you , " he said . Lucy looked up at the snow , and so did the doctor .  | " It will be fine to see her , " Lucy tried to make her voice sound calm and cheerful . But she knew when night came she would be alone ; it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Shippingport , Dr. Rankin 's house , Meadowbrook , was of logs , close kin to the settlers ' cabins . It was that log house of the bright " someday , " with a staircase , floors of thirty-foot planed boards , plaster in the main room and a new wing ambling out every time the doctor took a fresh wife and started a new set of children . There was glass , precious glass , in nearly every window and glass bottles on the shelves of the doctor 's little surgery , glass over the framed diploma announcing Dr. Adam Rankin as a graduate of a college at Princeton in New Jersey and glass over the drawing of the blue heron Audubon had made for him . Light gleamed across the doctor 's spectacles now as he smiled genially at Lucy , " Do n't count on your husband returning in a month . With that snow it may be six weeks ! " At first , the weeks went by rapidly enough . The doctor had accumulated , besides an antique cousin of one wife and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten , stood behind Lucy at the spinet , she recognized the child 's hunger and put her hand over the rather grubby fingers , pressing down on a key . " Listen , Melanie , it 's a bird wants to sing for you . " Indeed , the old spinet , brought by the first wife from Virginia , did rustle almost like a bird hidden in a wood . " Tomorrow , we 'll begin in earnest . " To Mistress Sally Rankin , Lucy said , " I 've had good instruction .  | I can do her no harm , I think . " Every day then , she labored with Melanie , who had not much gift for it . Weeks went by  --  four , five , six  --  but Dr. Rankin said , " Do n't worry . We want you to stay as long as you can . " After the seventh week , Lucy told the Rankins , " I might take Letty and Clementine in music , too . " Now , every afternoon , Lucy heard their scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet . Sally Rankin exclaimed , " How lucky we are to have you here . " After three months , the air was still gracious and hospitable , but one morning Lucy said to Mistress Sally , " At Fatland 1 used to help the younger children with lessons . It wo n't be like their having a real teacher , but I could start the younger children on their letters . " In the mornings then , Lucy guided George 's fingers over the slate in the corner of the great spinning-room that had been set aside as schoolroom . Now she turned to Homer , helped him form a wobbly " B. " When slates were covered , she kissed her charges and they escaped with a shout . The aged aunt had taught Lucy to spin on the small flax wheel . By now , Lucy had advanced to the dignity of the larger wheel for wool . She crossed to it . In Derbyshire , cloth was spun in the Arkwright mills ; in Pennsylvania , professional weavers traveled about . But in Kentucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , black and white , sorting over fleeces , cutting out burrs , running the sharp-nailed carder through the fiber . Lucy wished to learn weaving also , but Genji , the skilled slave who tended the loom , was jealous and would not let a beginner touch her careful web . Among the spinners , there were many small jealousies and prides in craft , but it was a sexless world , without sharp longings , and sometimes Lucy thought , So this is what it will be like to be old . Doctor Rankin laughed at her and called her Penelope , spinning her thread as she waited for her Ulysses . But she found a measure of release in the lovely rhythmic absorption , forgetting dull loneliness as her fingers twisted the yarn , as the wheel hummed and sang louder and louder , died ay , vay , as the paced forward , then lightly back , with the thread held delicately  | in hand . There was a satisfying feeling in the growing hank of spun thread . Eventually , it would become a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be part of a household , a home . Around the lengthening thread she sometimes created a home complete to copper pans gleaming above its fireplace . And she looked at the older women and thought , How lucky I am . I have all my life before me to bring this about , and with a wonderful husband and son . Only postponed a little . When one of the spinners began the customary reading from the Bible open on its stand , her voice rising above the hum of wheels with : " A virtuous woman who can find , For her price is far above rubies , The heart of her husband trusteth in her And he shall have no lack of gain . ... She seeketh wool and flax And worketh willingly with her hands .... " Lucy smiled , thinking , Yes , that 's it ! The reader went on : " With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard .. . She doeth him good and not evil All the days of her life . . . . " and smiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to be dike ! Frequently , travelers up and down the river stopped overnight or longer at Meadowbrook . One such , an English major on his way to a fort in the Northwest , was now a guest . Lucy , in a long-sleeved apron to protect her frock , with five children in small chairs around her , was saying , " Very good , Homer . Now , Adam , you read , " when she saw Mistress Sally and the major approaching , heard Sally say , " Major , I want you to meet a compatriot , Mrs. Audubon . " When the officer was introduced , in spite of his heel-clicking and precise bowing , Lucy saw he seemed uncomfortable . Leaving , Sally said in her vivacious voice , " Now , Lucy , be sure to allow yourself plenty  | of time to dress for the big party tonight ! " At the door , in a sudden lull in the spinning sounds , Lucy heard the major say to his hostess , " Most extraordinary ! You invite your governess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't exactly a governess . And even if she were , this is Kentucky ! " Lucy herself suddenly laughed . She was seeing , long ago , the white pillars of Fatland , seeing Miss Smith  --  poor touchy , oversensitive Miss Smith , worried about being called a governess . How silly she was , Lucy thought . I 'm me ! Sally knows it ! And more important  --  I know it ! By dusk , finished with chores and dressed for the party , Lucy walked as usual with Victor along the river . Redbud trees bloomed . In April , boats moved again on the river . She gazed north , studying each flat or barge or skiff until she could no longer dare hope her husband might be on it . Spring was a lonely time . She heard the shouting and laughing of the sugar-makers , men and women , faces smoky , clothing muddy , coming back after days and nights at the sugar camp in the forest . From poles on their shoulders heavy buckets swung , sloshing with syrup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return the occasion for the celebration . Neighbors were riding up on mules , on horses . In the house , on a canopied bed , Lucy saw many blanket-wrapped bundles  --  babies of mothers come to frolic . She passed one young mother , eyes bright as the cheap-flowered cotton worn like a shawl over her faded tow dress , speeding avidly toward the sound of the fiddle , away from endless days of scouring , sewing , stirring , hurrying to the husband waiting to dance with her . Lucy could hear Sally laughing with her husband over some private joke , hear the Negro men and women talking and laughing together . A party could be lonely , too . In the barn , Lucy sat down against the wall on an upturned bushelbasket . Lanterns shone over the galloping dancers , and she smiled , seeing the English major , staring as if at aborigines . Bare feet and moccasined feet beat on hard-trod earth as the fiddler sawed and a home-made banjo twanged ; the barn was fragrant with  | the odor of dried corn shucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancers a basket of young toads collected for fish bait . The women screamed and slapped , as the men , grinning , fumbled at skirts and ankles , ostensibly chasing toads . Louisville and the minuet , stately under silver candlesticks , vaguely unreal in the wilderness , seemed very far off indeed . Henderson was country mirth under smoking lanterns , foot-stomping , hand-clapping and wild shouting as partners were swung . Lucy 's feet beat to the rhythm . Then she saw Sally whisper to Dr. Rankin , saw him approach . But dancing with Dr. Rankin , and thus depriving another of a partner , was not the same . Lucy was back by the wall again when newcomers arrived . At first she did not even bother to see who they were . Then she heard Dr. Rankin shout , " Ulysses returned ! " and another , " There she is , over there . " Then another voice , beloved , longed for , called , " Lucy ! My Lucy ! " It was Audubon . Her heart leaped up . Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ran to him and he to her . He held her close , and all the dancers gave a great shout . His deerskin hunting shirt smelled of the forest and wild animals , but life , postponed a while , seemed to begin again . He stroked her hair back , " Is it well with thee , sweetheart ? " She wanted to touch him , his face , his hair , his shoulder . No , it was not a dream . He had come back , he held her , he kissed her . Friends converged , asking questions . Audubon replied , " Yes , we were frozen into the river ! At Great Bend . We had to wait it out ! " " But how did you get back ? That 's a hundred fifty miles ! " " I walked . " He held Lucy . " Do I not have a reason ? " But the fiddlers sawed impatiently . Another set began . Friendly hands pulled them , voices cried , " Come on . You have to dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held hers . She was glad they had stayed to join the dancers . She had a dim feeling she was joining again not only this dance , but some larger dance . She had a partner now . When the set ended , he guided her toward the door . It was part  | of the crude heartiness their going would be marked with laughing shouts , " Where y'all goin ' in such a hurry ? " Now they were outside in a dripping spring night . He kissed her as if for the first time . They started toward the house , his arm around her . " I do not return to St. Genevieve . " " And Rozier ? " " I 've broken up with him . We 're no longer partners . " His arm tightened around her . " My Lucy , I could not stand it , without a single word from thee or the child , and no way to get one . Oh , Rozier was right , there were French there , Canadians , river men , gamblers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of what use fifty per cent profit if I had not thee ? I made a bargain with him . Sold him my interest . He gave me what cash he had and for the rest I have his notes . " " I never got on with him , " she said , but some fairness made her add , " but I am sure his notes are good . " When Audubon held the candle above the trundle-bed , looking down at his son he said , " How big he is ! And how beautiful ! " Then the candle was out . She felt his lips on hers . I was dead , but now I am alive again . She did not think or worry about what they would do now . The fire roared up the chimney in the main room . Dr. Rankin forgot to smoke his clay pipe , Mistress Sally hushed her baby , young William Rankin stopped cleaning his gun and the younger children sat open-mouthed . Even the Negroes , clearing away coffee things , lingered , wide-eyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river was frozen solid . We made camp then , unloaded our goods under a great sycamore . The patroon of the keel knew we would be there many weeks . A fire , using whole trees , was built . It never went out the six weeks we were frozen there . Every night , by that fire , I would draw what I had found that day . " And the next evening , Dr. Rankin would urge , " Tell us what happened then , Ulysses . " Lucy stitched and Audubon perfected details in his new drawings . And he talked : " We were near a Shawnee encampment . After they found I could move through the  | forest without making a storm , they took me hunting . A brave people . I learned some of their language . For this they loved me . The squaws taught me their ways of making paints . To make black , they used gallberries . " Or on another night , the storyteller would begin : " Rozier , poor man ! What gloom ! He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can he get rich stuck in the ice ? He wrapped himself in a blanket and sat peering out like a bear hibernating . " Lucy , head bent over her needlework , listened and understood he had longed for her and the boy , missed them . But also the hardships , the strange life led with the Indians , the queer lore , the precise knowledge that the wild swan had a yellow spot above its black beak , the careful shot that must bring down their dinner , had been for him a completely satisfying experience . He had had his face pressed close to the great windowpane of nature , staring into it . But somehow , she understood too , the danger , dirt , squalor , could not have been accepted with high gay carelessness had he not known that a wife waited , who loved fresh linen and even on the frontier changed beds twice a week , a wife who served high tea rather than supper , whose consonants never slurred , but came forth with elegant precision . Victor wandered off sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became scared , hungry . But not really . He knew his mother waited . And someone would urge , " Tell us about when the ice broke , " and everyone would lean forward . But the nights were theirs . Long separation sharpened their passion . The summer was like a honeymoon . By the end of June , Lucy was expecting her second child . Doctor Rankin , who loved to go hunting with Audubon , would not hear of their leaving . They stayed on , but only , Audubon said , " While I am looking about for a suitable connection . " Months moved forward . One day , Lucy said , " VVe are here so long . With two children , we ought to have a place of our own . " He stroked her hair . " Yes . But Rozier has not sent the money . I need that capital to make a start again . I will go and get it . Then , we begin once more . " Dr. Rankin loaned him a horse . This time  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If one had hope , everything was possible . Surely he would be back in six weeks . But there were great floods that autumn . What if the baby came  --  and her husband not there ? That was impossible . But nature strode on , regardless . Lucy sat beside a little charcoal brazier . It was a cold winter . She had had a candle brought to her room , and was writing a letter to her younger sister Eliza , back in Fatland . She stopped often to stare for long dreamy pauses , then went on : ... to tell you we have a second son , delicate , but beautiful , I think , to be called John Woodhouse . The John is for my dear husband , who says he is now an American and signs himself plain John James , though my own fond name for him is always Laforest . My father will be pleased , I think , that his benefactor , Uncle Woodhouse , has been commemorated . Eliza , Eliza , what have you done to poor Nicholas Berthoud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit at Fatland , he passed here , and I heard nothing but Eliza , the charming . I am asked to find out if you are in love ! He is my husband 's best friend . We admire him greatly . Nicholas told me my brother Thomas journeys this way on the road to Orleans . It is hard to believe our Thomas is twentythree , and starting on his own . We will be happy to see him ... . She stopped , hearing a commotion downstairs . She sprang up . Dr. Rankin 's jovial voice boomed , " Audubon ! Everything 's fine ! You have another son ! Did you get your money from Rozier ? " " Yes . " She breathed a long sigh . Then she heard his steps pounding up the stairs . Lucy 's brother Thomas came down the river in a skiff from Louisville not long after . Thomas , talking in his enthusiastic way , brought news . " Of course , you 've heard about Nicholas Berthoud and our Eliza . He declares ever since he first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry a Bakewell . " And , " Nicholas told us you 'd broken up with Rozier . I do n't know what your plans are , but back in Fatland we discussed it , and it did seem , if you 're looking for an opening , you might want to join me . I 'm starting a commission firm , working downriver , to ship flour and bacon and lard out of Orleans . Naturally , I could use more capital . And your knowledge of French could be most useful at the Orleans end . " That night , Audubon said to Lucy , " Have I not been searching for an opening in trade ? " She had hoped to begin a family life of their own , and this would mean still another postponement . But everyone  --  Fatland , Dr. Rankin , his friend Isham Talbot , the Senator from Kentucky , home from Washington City  --  seemed to think it a good opportunity . Thomas was anxious to get under way . Isham Talbot , who was a lawyer , drew up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . Then they all drank a toast to " Audubon &; Bakewell , Dealers in Flour , Bacon &; Lard . " That afternoon , a keel bound for Orleans put in at Henderson for water and Thomas shipped as passenger . In a very few weeks they had a glowing letter from him : Am working night and day . Purchased large quantities as I came downriver . Some of it has already arrived here on the levee . My connections are helpful and active . I have been able to charter one fine bottom , and by luck , have a chance for another at a good rate , but my capital runs low . Are you able to send more ? If so , deposit with Berthoud in Louisville . They are well known here , and it can be drawn on through them . Audubon 's brows drew together . " Rozier still owes me some . I could write him and request he deposit it with Berthoud . Two ships chartered ! The firm of Audubon and Bakewell flourishes . Yes , I believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two later , after the money had been sent , they met Betsy , their former neighbor in Henderson . " My man 's gone , " she wept . " It was his time with the militia , and he went off with  | Gen'ral Harrison to put down an Indian risin ' . But the British helped the savages . A place called Tippecanoe . " She broke off with a sob . " All the others in that militia draw , they 're back . But not him . " They comforted her as best they could but later Lucy asked , " Is it that war Major Croghan talked about ? " In a month they knew the answer . Recruiting officers came through Henderson . " General Andy Jackson 's waiting to take volunteers down to Orleans . Any man 's eligible that owns a good rifle . Throw them British clear across the ocean , once and for all . " One of Dr. Rankin 's boys ran away in the night and joined the Kentucky Rifles . Scarcely any boats came up from Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rumor there was a British fleet off Orleans . The days passed slowly , without word from Thomas . Meadowbrook simmered now in August heat . But under the willows on the river side , a breeze stirred ; Lucy put the infant Johnny down in a hammock . Victor could be heard shouting with the Rankin children . Audubon , about to start a new drawing , smiled as he looked at the hammock . " Our Johnny 's been frail , but soon he 'll be climbing trees with Victor . " The specimen was a Carolina parrot . Audubon studied it , and Lucy , her arm about his shoulders , studied it with him . This way on the board ? Or that ? " By the summer kitchen , " she said , " I saw a branch of creeper with a beautiful sweep , the twigs at exquisite angles , even a few berries dangling . I 'll get it . " When she returned she brought also a branch of pine , found nearby . Standing behind him as he tried both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the new project planned . It 's almost like when I know a new baby 's coming , she thought . " That Indian squaw told me she made orange color from grinding barberry roots . " Lucy said , " For this you may want that color . " As he began to work , she fetched a small pestle and the gathered root and sat beside him , pulverizing . In the still heat , they heard a boat horn . Mail ? From Orleans ? Then she saw a figure crossing the lawn . She sprang up . " Thomas ! " Now she could see her brother 's face , tired and dejected .  | Audubon dropped his pencil . " We hoped for a letter , but this is best . You came yourself ! " When he had gone downriver , Thomas looked less than his twenty-three years . Now he looked more . " You understand I did everything anyone could . It was beyond help . " They stared at him . " The news is not good ? " " Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " " If only I 'd not gotten in so deep so fast . I drew on what you placed at Berthoud 's to charter the second vessel . Both were outside the harbor , laden , bound for New York , before the danger was understood . The French captured one , the English another . " " Captured ! " " If I 'd been laggard , allowed the stores to molder on the levee , but ? " " Our capital ? " Thomas licked his lips . " Gone . But , " he defended himself , " our credit 's still good . I 'm going back now to Pittsburgh . Uncle Ben knows the mercantile men there . All I want 's another chance . The firm of Audubon and Bakewell 's not through yet . " Thomas poured out all his bad luck , so that by the time the keel horn sounded and he was hurrying across the green toward the river , it seemed to Lucy he moved more briskly , as if he had put down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale . But Lucy was facing the fact that now it would be a long time before they could start on their own . They both sat still , absorbing the shock . Then Victor yelled down gustily from a tree-top to his playmates , and Lucy picked up the pestle , almost automatically , and began pounding the orange color again . Audubon , too , picked up his pencil . He had broken off at the most difficult preliminary , the outlining of the bird . After a while , she saw that his mouth had lost its grim set . How lucky we are , she thought . One thing is lost , but at the same moment , a new thing is created .  | Energetically , her husband sought a mercantile opening in the neighborhood ; he wrote to the Berthouds in Louisville to ask if they knew of one there . But months passed . Waiting , he hunted and drew , his collections swelling . Lucy enjoyed walking in the forest with her husband and she went on teaching the Rankin children and tending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel the weight of postponement . One day , in their chamber , she opened one of her boxes ; the silver inside was blackened with tarnish . Audubon found her there , staring at the silver . He said , " I can not wait longer for opportunity to come to me . I must take action . It means another long journey . There should be remaining in Pennsylvania a portion of Mill Grove . But litigation clouds it . If I made the journey , something might be salvaged . I will go . " Alone again , Lucy saw spring turn into summer . Dr. Rankin said , " Lucy , come ride with me in the gig into Henderson . An airing will do you good . " Nearly into Henderson , the doctor said , " It 's only three months , Lucy . You know the journey alone takes two . " " Of course , " she said . " And there are bound to be legal difficulties , even if my father helps him . " But she could not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mill Grove . When the doctor went to visit his patient , Lucy walked about the town . She passed the cabin where they had lived when they first came to Henderson . Another transient family had lived there for a while but had gone on southward . It was empty . In the tangle of weeds around the door she saw a long tendril . The rose cutting sent her from Fatland ! It had shown only a sickly shoot that first year . But now it had somehow established itself . " Say it ! Say it again ! " Lucy laughed , as her husband held her on his lap . " We actually have the money from Mill Grove ! " " We have it ! And I want to keep holding thee . At night , on the journey , how often I did not sleep , wondering about thee . " " And everyone at Fatland ? "  | " The affair of Nicholas and Eliza goes forward . Naturally , your father asks many questions about the Berthouds . Your brother Thomas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Page , the merchant we met in New York , now a partner of your Uncle Benjamin in Pittsburgh . Your little sister , Ann , grows up and is beautiful . Your father helped much in hastening the payment of money from Mill Grove , but also , before I left , he did not fail to point out Mill Grove was my last resource . " " As if we did n't know . " " And his new wife  --  the charming Miss Smith , who still does not like me  --  she interferes to say that with your father 's other children still to be helped , no more should be expected from him . In addition it is pointed out to me that your Uncle Benjamin , though bankrupted by the embargo , has now , through diligence , established himself again , in a glass manufactory in Pittsburgh . I have given it all much thought , as I rode back . Oh , my Lucy , at Natural Bridge , in Virginia , I found cliff swallows and have a fine drawing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At each , I ponder  --  could we start here ? " " Listen , my dearest ! In Henderson , the log cabin is empty . I saw it . Why could we not start right where we are ? My rosebush has somehow established itself there . It 's a good omen . " Audubon nodded . " In Henderson ? Why not ? There are now nearly two hundred people here . Begin with no partners this time . Go our own gait . Why could we not succeed ? " She thought that indeed they must . CHAPTER NINETEEN LUCY HAD HEARD of people dancing with joy  --  but actually to be wakened by joy ! For once , she sprang out of bed before her husband . A wedding anniversary , and one 's sixth ,  | was fine , but it was the great surprise , plotted so long and finally to be given her husband today , that lightened her step . She sped about her household , lifting Johnny  --  two now and no longer frail ? hugging Victor , nearly five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawing but would betake himself to the store at once . But no  --  he and Victor hung about , whispering most tiresomely , and then suddenly disappeared . What could they be up to ? She ran to read again the secreted paper , secured yesterday from the town clerk : " . . . hereby deeded to John Audubon ... that twoacre plot , with orchard and pond at the southeast corner of Third Street ... for the sum of one hundred dollars .... " All these months , hoarding shillings , goldpieces , even Spanish milled dollars , her husband laughing at her for being a scrimp , she had smilingly said to herself : " She considereth a field and buyeth it ; With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard .... " Young William Rankin came then with the turtles he 'd collected to stock the pond . Ten of them , in a barrel , lively and crawling . " Thank you , William ! My husband will be pleased ! He 's very fond of turtle soup . Be sure not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The store now occupied their old bark cabin . They lived in a log house with glass windows and a porch . Their new orchard was all abloom . Lucy wondered if it might not be nice to have the party there this afternoon . But  --  she looked about her house with fond pride . Not that it was large , but the linen curtains were hers , from the flax to the dying and stitching . The settle , its cherry frame made by McTag , the joiner , with down pillows of her own stuffing , its cover a deep purple silk  --  unraveled from an old gown , rewoven , dyed with pokeberries  --  looked rich , she thought . Smiling , she remembered the rest of the verse : " For all her household are clothed with scarlet She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry , Her clothing is of fine linen and purple ... "  | Even the rough logs of the interior walls scarcely showed . Books , many of them , and the lovely Crith china , though displayed on crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought recently from Dr. Rankin , polished the silver , Lucy arranged the table . In Henderson , food seemed to spill out of some great cornucopia . A man could have sport and at the same time provide his family with fish , turkey , duck and venison , and if his wife were provident , they could have melons , wild grapes , berries , fruit and vegetables in abundance . As she worked , she smiled secretly at the richest happiness of all . She was sure  --  almost sure  --  she was going to have another child . The great surprise , the new orchard and turtle pond , had been a happy success . Now , in late afternoon , Lucy looked happily past their guests to her husband , toasting her . She was glad she still had the dark red silk gown . In Henderson , homespun , fustian or tow , even at the new Meeting House , was customary . But this gown was cherished from her trousseau . The toasts went round  --  in homemade peach brandy and Kentucky bourbon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmarthan and his wife . They had come to Henderson a year ago from a town upriver whose schoolhouse had burned . To their right sat the new minister  --  through Dr. Rankin 's influence , from Princeton  --  a very young man , still dripping Latin and Greek quotations in small puddles around him . Now came the big surprise for Lucy . Victor , holding a small violin , came in . While Audubon beat time , Victor , his mouth twisted with effort , sawed out a little tune . Lucy 's heart nearly burst with pride . To think of Victor being clever enough to learn ! And her husband imaginative enough to conceive of such a present ! But suddenly Johnny burst into yowls . Dr. Rankin smiled . " Exactly the way I feel , Johnny . Yell a little louder to express my protest , too , will you ? Though to your mother I 'm sure it 's beautiful . " More toasts were drunk . Dr. Rankin said , smiling , " On such an  | occasion , there is always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , would you do it again ? " Audubon was on his feet . " A thousand times , yes ! " He raised his glass . " Let me count my blessings . My wife , the most delightful of women ! My two fine lads ! My good friends ! Even my log house , though small , is beside a beautiful river , with food at hand for the taking . " " Even turtle soup ! " " Not forgetting such journeys  --  if he has eyes open and pencil ready  --  he is able to collect and record Nature 's beautiful handwork . " This seemed a splendid moment to bring in the final present . Lucy signaled William Rankin , and he and Carmarthan brought in the box . It was chestnut , put together by McTag at Lucy 's order , big enough to hold Audubon 's largest drawings . " I fear smoke or grease from the fireplace , or even Johnny 's fingers , could mar a drawing , " she said . " This will protect them . " Audubon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , careful wife ? " Then he sprang up , and took out the heavy portfolios . " I can not wait but must try if they fit . " Soon the drawings were spread about . They began to stack and sort them . " Here 's the redbreasted nuthatch , " Lucy said , and " Here 's my friend , the night hawk , " Audubon smoothed a drawing . " From my trading journey to the Green River . " Soon , glancing about , Lucy thought the house looked rich indeed , with the beautiful drawings about and the warm interested faces bending over them . The young minister said , " I 've studied natural history in college and these drawings seem to me quite fine . " " I 've studied it in the field , " Rankin said , " and they seem to me damn fine ! " Carmarthan said , " They might even interest artists , " and the young minister said , " Or trained ornithologists . Or even some scientific body like the Philadelphia Academy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will tell you , dear friends . A thing hovers in my mind , its ground-plan only halfcompleted.  | But my heart leaps up to it  --  especially when one considers the slaughter of many birds , that some may vanish , never to be seen again . Of course some birds I have not found yet and many regions I 've not seen  --  the northern states and Florida , for such journeys would require regular expeditions . Nevertheless , as I go about my other business , I do not forget this plan . To make a complete record , done with precision and what art I may  --  of every bird in my country , America . " There was a knock and Betsy , their former neighbor , widowed at Tippecanoe , came in with her ill baby , wanting Dr. Rankin to look at him . The doctor examined him and gave her some pills from his ever-present black bag . " He 's puny , " Betsy said . " Children go fast . I might not have him long . " She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , would you draw his picture ? " Audubon smiled and quickly brought out his pad and black chalk and set to work . Betsy said , " He 's got a little curl here , see ? " Then McTag , Betsy 's second husband , who owned the new joiners ' shop , came inquiring for her . Seeing all the drawings about seemed to make him ill-at-ease , as if it were some evidence of sin or loose living . " Fellow told me you closed your store once to take off after a hawk and follered it for three days over hill and dale , but I never believe a bad thing about anybody unless it 's proved . But you certainly have a lot of bird pictures . " Betsy said , almost defiantly , " I tole him to make the baby 's picture instead of paying for the box in cash . " McTag 's mouth opened in incredulous horror . " It ai n't that I begrudge you , but it 's the principle of the thing . I 'm in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Audubon finished and handed the little sketch to the mother . " A present from a neighbor . " McTag 's mouth set . " Come on , Betsy . " He stopped at the door . " I 'll tell you one thing : makin ' pictures and chasin ' canaries ai n't what we need here . Time wastin ' . How anyone can be so peculiar beats me . " But when the McTags were gone , there was music , with Carmarthan  | singing , and after the party , with the happy day spinning to its close , Lucy , before bedtime , read aloud , as usual , to her closegathered family . This time , for memory 's sake , she read The Fables . " When I lived at Fatland and your father at Mill Grove , before we were married , we read this . " Victor , puzzled , asked , " Did I live with you , Mama , or with Papa , before you were married ? " At last , prayers were said , covers tucked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lovers now . Audubon put a finger under Lucy 's chin , lifting her face . " In the candlelight , in the beautiful red silk gown , I said to myself , How lovely she is ! ' " " I should be admired , really , that after six years and two children , it still spans me . " " It is late . I will carry thee to bed . As on the mountain Allegheny . That was our springtime , our tremulous beginning . But now it is with us as in the rich summer . " " Why could n't I go with you , Papa ? " Victor tangled himself in the pack in his eagerness . Audubon , about to leave on a trading journey to Philadelphia that autumn in 1815 , already wore his deerskin trousers and his long deerskin hunting shirt . Over it , he buckled a wide belt , thrusting into it his long scabbarded knife and his tomahawk . " Soon , soon , my lad . But for now , study everything in the woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured powder into his buffalo horn , filled his ball pouch and fastened both to the belt . When he sat down to examine his moccasins , the boys pressed at once against his knees . " Victor , when you go exploring in the woods , remember Johnny is only three . Allow him sometimes to seem to find a nest or animal tracks . The young need encouragement . " Lucy , rolling the small parcel of her husband 's personal linen and the much larger parcel of his journal and drawing materials in their deerskin cover , glanced at the cradle . Her daughter Lucy , ten months old now , slept . She was frail , even more so than Johnny had been and Lucy hoped the boys would not wake her .  | The cornbread in a clean cloth she packed beside the cold pease pudding in a tin box , hurrying , for her husband was almost ready to go . He was waiting for George , Celia 's husband , to come from the store and help him carry the heavy box of drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Audubon examined the drawings on top . " Lucy , see this one ! The pewees on the Perkiomen , dated 1806 ! I draw better now . On this trip , I may have a chance to replace it . " The little girl wakened , crying , and Lucy gave her some of the medicine Dr. Rankin had left . " She does not seem so lively today . " " Perhaps I ought not go , " Audubon hesitated . " Oh , but it 's such a splendid chance , with the Berthouds having a keel ready at Louisville ! " Lucy pushed back the specter of lonely months . " Sometimes I think to be a merchant is not so fortunate  --  when it is time to leave thee . " Carefully , he fitted the lid on the wooden box with the stored drawings . Then he looked around . " In this room , there is all I value in the world and enough to make any man happy . My sweetheart , my fine Kentucky lads , my angel daughter  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she patted his shoulder , " you 're bound to find some fine new birds ! " " Yes ! " his eyes brightened . " I am perhaps greedy of life and want too much . " George came now . He lifted one end of the box , Audubon the other . Lucy could hear them bumping along with it , putting it down in the little dark storeroom . But now , there was no postponing . He kissed the boys , looked at his sleeping daughter , held Lucy close for a moment , then picked up his rifle and pack . When he was a little way off he turned to wave his large round felt hat . " With luck , I 'll be back by Christmas ! " " Yessum , Miz Audubon , " George stood in the doorway . " But who 's to tend store if I be here cuttin ' wood ? " " I can not leave the little girl . "  | " How that sweet little Lucy girl this night ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week Mr. Audubon will return . " When Dr. Rankin came , he looked exhausted . Diphtheria and scarlet fever stalked the village . He examined the little girl , and then sat looking at Lucy , as if waiting for strength to say something . " Here are tablets . Give her one every three hours . Keep her warm . But  --  I ought to warn you . There 's little chance they 'll help . " " Give them to me ! There is a chance ! Every three hours , you say ? " Now the doctor was gone . Lucy sat watching the little girl 's waxen lids . After a while , Betsy McTag came in . " I seen your light . It 's the little girl , ai n't it ? I brought my work . I 'll set with you a spell . " " Oh , Betsy , the doctor 's willing to let her go . I ca n't do that . I wo n't let her die . " Betsy , settling herself by the fire and bringing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt when my last boy went . " She sighed . Warming one of the carders at the fire so the wool would catch in its bent wire teeth , she said , " Many 's the time I was glad anyway your husband drew his picture . " Lucy put on a careful log . Betsy passed the fleece across the carder on her knee and said , " McTag says if your wood 's low , him and some of the others will provide you . " The two women looked at each other . Then Betsy dropped her eyes , seeming to busy herself with brushing the fleece , making it into small fleecy rolls . " I know you 're thinkin ' McTag and the others would mighty enjoy bringin ' wood , tryin ' to shame your husband . When he sits here sometimes for days drawin ' a bird ? that do n't hurt them none . But some folks  --  it worries them if anyone 's different . " " Why ? He does n't try to make them do what he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him because he is n't like them ? " Betsy shook her head . " To my mind your husband 's no worse than a man that 's mad for drink . In a way  --  it 's the same , for a  | drinkin ' man may go off for days , but maybe be gentle and real nice afterward . Your husband , when he 's here , takes his boys fishin ' , or sits and talks to you . Sometimes , evenings , I pass here and stop to listen to the flute and singin ' . McTag does n't drink or run to the woods . But he do n't hold with laughin ' or talkin ' , either . " Lucy settled to her own work . It was very quiet except for the click of her hand-reel as she wound wool from the great spindle . Then both women looked up , startled , at the rustling and scampering somewhere in the house . " Listen ! " Betsy said , " that 's rats ! " " Rats ? No , I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long winter . Come in from the woods , crazy for food . They got into a cabin over at Horn Patch . Chewed one of the little children . " Terrified , Lucy sprang up . Victor and Johnny slept in a room at the side . Just then the little girl opened glassy eyes and made a faint sound . Lucy was at the cradle , bending over . " Oh , my love ! My pet ! She 's smiling , Betsy . I told the doctor I would n't let her go ! " She gave her the medicine . Then it was quiet again . They did not even hear the rats rustling . The women 's hands moved rhythmically at their work . Two o'clock struck . Lucy said , " If she lives through the night , I have a feeling she 'll be all right . " After a while Betsy said , " Listen ! Do you hear her breathin ' ? " Lucy bent down over the cradle with passionate intensity . Finally she straightened up . " Maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . Then she put an arm around Lucy . " Sometimes , out here in this country , I think a girl baby 's better off so . Nothing but worry and meanness . You still have two fine boys . " " Miz Audubon ! Keel landed ! He comin ' ! " George ran , with Victor and Johnny following . Audubon dropped his traps . Arms wide , he gathered the boys up . Then Lucy felt his ardent arms , his kiss , and came alive again . In the house , the boys tugged at his boots . " My lads have grown ! How I missed my darlings ! A fine journey all the same .  | I sold the tobacco for a good price . At Pittsburgh , I laid in splendid trade goods . And besides  --  three new drawings ! The white-throat I have been seeking ! And wait ! " He opened his pack . " I know it 's February , but here are Christmas presents . For Lucy , a gold thimble , skates for Victor , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon she 'll be old enough to throw it . " He looked at the hearth . George had long ago removed the empty cradle . " The ground was all frozen , Papa , when they dug in the orchard , " Victor said . Audubon stared , wild-eyed , from empty hearth to Lucy . Then his face was in his hands . Johnny broke into loud wails . Audubon straightened up at once and drew Johnny to him , comforting , " Never mind , my lad . " Lucy wept and he held her close , stroking her hair . " My sweetheart , here all alone . " " Just let me cry ! " Lucy said . " It 's good to give way . I was afraid I would have to sustain you . " Outside the February trees bloomed with sagging white cotton roses of snow . He gazed at the small grave in the orchard . Tears came to his eyes , but when she wept , he comforted her . She said , " You are stronger and better about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between a man and a woman . " In the evening , Audubon played the flute for her . " If only I were rich , to bring from Orleans a piano . It would be a great comfort to thee now . " And once when he found her crying , he said , " Leaves fall , buds come . Do not despair . Another child could come to thee . " " George can finish unloading the trade goods . " Audubon had gone to the store early that morning , but now , an hour later , returned . " They 're slaughtering hogs at Grimes ' farm , and above , I saw a black vulture circling . I need one for my collection . " He took his gun from over the mantel , poured shot into his bag and examined his flints . " I 'll have to hurry . " But the black vulture had not waited . An hour later , Audubon returned . " Too late ! Gone ! Ah , well , I 've all the new drawings made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll and spread  | out the new drawings on the table . Johnny grabbed at them . " No , no , Johnny ! I 'll put them away with the others in the wooden box . " The storeroom had a damp chill . The box rested on the floor . Lucy held the new drawings . He bent over and lifted the box lid . Inside the box , in the middle of the thousand drawings , rats had built a nest . They had left a great hole in the center of the sheets and the obscenity of their scatology . A knifelike horror cut through her . She remembered . " I heard them . I should have come . " Audubon stared wildly . " Gone ! Eaten ! The drawings I left with thee . " " The child was sick . Do n't you understand ? I heard them , but I was with the little girl ! " He was deathly pale . His eyes started out of his head . He has gone mad , she thought . " It 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried in a grating voice . She put out a hand , but he shrank away , staring at her , his eyes wild , incredulous , as at some obscene horror . Then , he tore off his coat . He is mad , she thought . He ran out of the storeroom . She heard him leave the house . At dinner , he had not returned . She fed Victor and Johnny . By the time the candles were lit and the children asleep , she sat by the fire waiting . Dr. Rankin came in . " I heard Audubon had returned ! What 's the matter ? " " His drawings ! The thousand drawings ! Rats nested in the box they were stored in . They ate right through the middle . He ran out of the house and has not returned . I heard the rats . But I did n't do anything . It was when the little girl was sick . " " But , he ca n't blame you for that ! " She stared at the fire . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned of little Lucy 's death , he wept  --  a little . But , he contained his grief . I thought him strong . But , for a box of drawings , he is driven mad with grief . " " Lucy , surely you see . You know what went into them . All the perception , observation , strained hours , thousands of drops of his life-blood , of energy , life itself . "  | " And into the little girl ? " " Lucy , listen ! About the child , he acted about as any man would . And yet  --  it 's only natural that when you see how differently he reacts to the loss of his work , you should feel estranged . But , my dear , he is not McTag , or even Rankin . He is himself , Audubon , a passionately intense man with an extraordinariness about him . Would you want him to be a McTag ? I think not . And yet , I feel for you , Lucy . You , the sweet , sensible young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire a monstrous quality , become spotted . You have to keep stretching yourself to fit him . As you must stretch now to understand that this is for him as the loss of ten children . Go to bed now . Try to sleep . " The next day , Audubon still had not returned . In the evening Lucy rode to Meadowbrook . Dr. Rankin 's troubled glance met hers . " I have a feeling he has gone into the woods . " Lucy sat down , head bent , hands between her knees . " You said I must stretch , because he 's extraordinary . But  --  I am ordinary . I do n't know what 's expected of me . " " Well , my dear , do n't forget that outside of us , there 's something , a force , that has a hand in all this , too . Again and again , I see a woman lose a child . But something pushes her on , gives her strength , in spite of pain and grief . There 's no sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's the same with a man like Audubon . Carving and creating and making something new . God knows how or from where . " She stood up , weeping . " I do n't understand what 's expected of me . " When she returned , Audubon was not back , but at midnight he came in . Seeing his bereft face , she flew to him . If only I could give him what he gives me when he returns  --  he makes me live again . But his hand felt cold in hers . She built up the fire and cooked him food , he ate absently . In bed , beside him , she tried to warm him with her love . He sat up . " It 's like a fire burning inside my head . Eaten up . Wasted . " Weariness finally brought sleep . In the morning as she dressed and moved about , it seemed strange and wounding to see him  | sleeping , loglike , as though he had become a McTag . She had become accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life 's first chirpings . Stretch , the doctor said . She stirred porridge , tied Johnny 's boots , washed Victor 's ears , but absently , thinking that when the little girl died it was having to do for the others that had saved her . He came in and ate breakfast , white and silent , and went to the store . At noon , he returned , still without a word . Lucy steeled herself . Then , matter-of-factly , she picked up some of the new drawings they had been about to put away when they discovered the loss . " Where shall we put these ? We must find a safe place . " Pain flooded his face . She quailed . Then  --  he wept . That is good , she thought . She put a hand on his shoulder . " You comforted me by reminding me I could have another child  --  could begin again . " " How replace the fruit of fifteen years of my life ? " Stretch , Dr. Rankin had said . " Inside you are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to stare at her . His eyes do not look insane now , she thought . Only very sad . Next morning , when she woke , he was gone . She sprang out of bed . Perhaps I 've only driven him wild again . She ran into the main room . She saw his kit , his papers , pencils , his gun were gone too . Tears came to her eyes . He had begun again . CHAPTER TWENTY LUCY WAKENED EARLY and came into their main room one spring morning to find her husband already bent over his drawing-table . She saw the mud on his boots , the new specimen on the board . She hurried toward him with a glad cry , " The warbler ! The one you 've been seeking ! " She put an arm  | about his shoulders . He looked up and kissed her . Their losses , deepening understanding , seemed to have given a new dimension to their feeling for each other . She looked at the drawings on the wall  --  replacements in his collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a year later , his portfolios had begun to bulge again . " It seems to me , and to Dr. Rankin , too , that the new drawings are more sparkling , precise , graceful , than the old . " Audubon smiled . " All I 've learned goes into them now . " But the workaday world tugged at her skirts . " We can not put it off any longer ; we must make soap . We have no more and I do n't like to borrow . This late in spring everyone is short . " Audubon bent over his work . " I must finish before the coloring changes . I 'll come then to help . " George was tending store but Celia was strong . She and Lucy lifted the soap-kettle on to the hook over the fire in the backyard . Lucy finished weighing the grease . Saved over the winter , it smelled abominably . " We have twenty-four pounds of grease . If we use six bushels of ashes , that should give us a barrel of soap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lye . " My mammy alluz says , soaps wo n't make lessen your lye strong enough . She say , lye ought to be strong enough to hold up a potato with jist a place the size of a penny showin ' . " Victor and Johnny darted in and out from the fire . " Boys , go in at once ! Stay with your father . It 's too dangerous here ! " The two women struggled with the heavy container of lye . There , it was in the kettle . They stirred . But the soap did not make . It was hot by the fire . Lucy 's skirt was tucked up and pinned around her waist . Perspiration dripped off her face . They were running out of wood . Lucy looked toward the house , impatient and cross that Audubon had not come to help them . She grasped the short-handled axe , chopped sticks in two . " It ai n't makin ' yet , " Celia said . " Sometimes it jis ' wo n't . " " Celia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out she 'd put bread to rise . She ran into the house . Hearing strange voices , she went to the front of the house .  | " Thomas ! Thomas Bakewell ! " she cried and kissed her brother . " Do n't you know who this is ? " Thomas smiled . She blinked at the other visitor , who stared at her with a strange look . Memories swept over her  --  a ball in a great house , a young man asking for her hand . " It 's Arthur Wellesley . " It 's not fair , she thought , conscious of her straggling hair , sweatstreaked face , muddy skirt pinned back , old boots , and of her two children peering shyly like wild things , their hair not cut recently , their bare feet dirty . She held out a hand , but the soot had not washed out of the cracks in the roughened skin . " Do sit down , " Lucy said . Wellesley , in his fine broadcloth , looked at the settle curiously before he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it seemed homemade and crude ; the silk was cracked . Even the curtains seemed to sag and the dye looked streaked . Sitting gingerly on the settle , Wellesley stared at Audubon , at the drawing board , then at her . She wanted to cry out it only seemed strange that Audubon sat drawing while she chopped wood and made soap . Her brother Thomas chatted on , " Elizabeth Page and I will be married in Pittsburgh . Her father 's a partner in the glass manufactory there with Uncle Ben  --  Bakewell &; Page .... " As Thomas rattled away , Wellesley looked at Lucy . Then she became aware of her husband 's eyes . He stared at Wellesley , then at her . She had never before seen quite that look on his face . She suddenly wished Thomas and Wellesley had not come . " Wellesley 's just traveling for pleasure , " Thomas said blithely , " but I 'm here on business . As a matter of fact , I want to look over the town right now . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they had departed , Audubon left his drawing and went out to the yard to finish the soap-making . A pity . Lucy knew he liked to do the first outlining at one sitting . Still , she was glad to have the time in the house . She bustled about , ordering Celia to put out the best silver and linen , while she herself washed the Crith china , not used every day . Then , daffodils from the dooryard , and finally  --  she put on the dark red silk dress . By tea-time , under candlelight , her roughened hands did not show and she glanced  | about at the household she had created . It was almost rich again . But not quite . Even the silk gown , in Philadelphia eyes , was probably queer and old-fashioned . Then Audubon came in , silent and gloomy . He looked about , then burst out , " Yes , put out the best china and silver . Perhaps he will not look at you with such pity . Perhaps he will not notice your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes  --  facts I have refused to see ! " Soon the visitors will be gone , she thought , and this will pass . She said matter-of-factly , " I 'm glad the soap made finally . " When the visitors returned for tea , what with Thomas ' chatter , everything went well , she thought , until Wellesley said , " A pity you 're not coming East for Eliza 's wedding . She 's a handsome young lady now  --  though not so pretty as her older sister was . " He looked at her in that odd way , and Audubon saw it . " Here we are together again . It brings back our young days , does n't it ? One picture always remains with me of those times . Lucy , after tea , playing at her piano . How I would like to hear you again . " Audubon hitched in his chair . Victor said , " The Pells have a piano . It came from Orleans on the boat . " There was a silence , then a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting journey so far . Naturally , I have the excuse of some legal work in Orleans , " he was a lawyer now , " but really I 'm just seeing the country . " Very early next morning Lucy heard the boat horn and knew Arthur Wellesley would be moving downriver . She was glad . For a few moments , she wished Thomas had gone , too . He had stayed up late last night talking to her husband . And this morning he came back . " Steam 's the thing on the Philadelphia Bourse , and when the bankers there talk of it , that 's something ! The day I stood on the Pittsburgh wharf and saw a boat come upriver , propelled not by rope but steam , I realized that soon this power would be harnessed not only to boats , but to carriages and mills . A jinni waiting . Father believes in this , too . He got hold of'a fine mechanic just over from Glasgow , a chap named Prentice , and would you believe it , Lucy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the local  | wheat ! I want to try a steam mill and I believe Henderson , a growing town and on the river , is the place . Father promises to back me . And Thomas Pears  --  you remember Tom Pears from Uncle Ben 's counting-house in New York ? ? Tom 's going to come in , too . And that mechanic , Prentice  --  a clever fellow  --  will build the engine . Father thinks , getting in at the beginning so , we might all make a comfortable thing of it . Now , do you wish to join , to put in some capital ? " " Capital ? " Audubon sounded doubtful . " All we have now is this house with its two acres , the two-acre plot Lucy saved for , the store and stock . " " Father 's loaning me three thousand and Pears is putting in another three thousand . We figure it will take about twelve thousand to get started . " Lucy said , " We have never done very well with partners . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Wellesley had not come . Thomas , full of plans , talked enthusiastically . " If we build a steam mill here , farmers could bring their grain to be ground and we 'd take part in payment , then we could build a steamboat to ship that flour down-river . The mill could cut lumber too . It 'll be a big enterprise . Now I know you 're getting by here  --  you have a roof ? but I know also you must be concerned about the future . Elizabeth and I plan a family and I know I 'll want to do something for my children , just as our parents did for us . I 'm sure you and Lucy , with Victor and Johnny growing up , have given a great deal of thought to that already . Things are moving on in this country . Ten years ago , when we went to the counting-house in New York ? trade was the thing . Then , after the embargo , Uncle Ben saw manufacturing was the thing . But now , we 're moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fascinated by it for a long time . Father taught me higher mathematics and Lucy 'll remember I built a model of Watt 's engine once . One thing I can tell you , with a general merchandise store in Henderson , you 'll never be richer than you are at this moment . But the mill could be a big thing . " " Only  --  I know nothing of this steam . "  | " You could keep on with the store , borrow on it for investment capital . As we built the mill , you could learn , and then when it gets under way , you might want to sell the store , too . " It was late when the discussion broke off . That night , as Lucy prepared to blow out their candle , Audubon said , " Thomas is right . A storekeeper at Henderson , population three hundred , will always be one whose wife , though he loves her , must soil her hands and get smoke in her hair , making soap . I have been forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourse , your father  --  all agree this steam is a thing to make money . Perhaps I should join Thomas . " " Thomas has tremendous energy and enthusiasm . So have you . Thus you attract each other . But his interests are n't yours ! " " His interest is to provide well for his future family . I know well if it were not for thy clever thriftiness , we would live poor indeed . " " What 's poor ? Poor 's thinking it . Poor is seeing our life through the eyes of Philadelphia . You 've been happy here ! " " But now I understand more is expected of me . I must bestir myself . My Lucy has not even a piano . " " That 's not important ! " " To me now , seeing the bitter truth , it has become important . In America , where there is so much , a man is expected to do well for his family , to make money . " " We 've enough food , we 've warm beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it . That is the spear that wounds me . Thomas says , ' Of course you want to educate your sons . ' How do this as we bye now ? Good lads and intelligent . It might be that if I had money I could send them someday to a university , which I myself feel the lack of . No , I must enter into this thing and procure money . " Lucy was silent . In secret truth , she herself longed for her sons ID he educated men . If we borrowed on the store , we would still have it in case flings did not go well . " After a while , she nodded .  | The council meeting was always open . But today , the whole town came . " Philadelphia capital " and " ninety-nine-year lease " ? they rolled these rich new words around . The council , in store coats , made an array of broad backs in front . Behind them , men in deerskin , decently accoutered with rifle and shot bag , sat staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strange symbols  --  horsepower , flywheel. " ... and the mill building we plan to erect will be four stories high . Our engineer , Mr. Prentice , will build the engine . " A man in deerskin muttered , " Why could n't things be left as is ? Man could git a livin ' outa the woods and river . " " It 's the women fussin ' about schools and churches brought it on . First thing , they 'll be gittin ' a bank in here . Might as well 've stayed back in Virginia . " The women in tow and fustian stared at Thomas ' pretty bride , as she gazed in amazed adoration at her new husband from under her fashionable bonnet . The women stared , too , at Mrs. Pears , in broadcloth and genteel shoes , and the barefooted children stared at the little Pears girls in pantaloons and black slippers . Then McTag was saying , " ? hereby grant a lease on the valuable river frontage from Main to Chestnut for the nominal sum of twenty dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a steam mill , to the firm of Bakewell , Pears &; Audubon . " The meeting was over and Lucy stood up with the others . They 'd had no difficulty in borrowing three thousand on the store and house . Three men , McTag , a Joseph Sneaders and Mr. Wright , lately come here , had banded together to sign the note . Lucy saw Thomas and Pears leave at once with Audubon . These days her husband had a new look of strain and spent long hours at the site .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE IN SIX MONTHS , the building was up . " Considering how many parts we had to build right here of wood , " Thomas said proudly , " it works quite well . " But Mrs. Pears was saying , " What 's to become of one 's mind in such a place ? It 's not only that they have no ideas of decent society , never read a book or newspaper  --  but they resent it if anyone else does . I 'm not comfortable here . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Among people so stupid you 'll undoubtedly make a great deal of money . But I feel it 's better if I withdraw now ; then you know what to count on . " " Without this capital , we must ask for more credit , " Audubon said . " Oh , you 'll make out , " Pears said . Lucy had been prepared for Pears ' withdrawal , but not , somehow , for what happened later . Thomas said , " Now that it 's just a matter of sitting here and putting grain and lumber through the mill , I 've discovered what I really want to do ! Build engines . Prentice and I want to start a new firm  --  Bakewell &; Prentice , Engine Builders . How does it sound ? We 'll have to move to a larger place , of course , Cincinnati or Pittsburgh . I 'd feel a little upset at pulling out if it were n't that Mr. Page is willing to invest something . It 's not just because he 's my wife 's father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , Thomas , " there seemed always to be a strained frown on Audubon 's face these days , " that machinery is not easy for me . Sometimes I think the engine is like an animal that knows I 'm afraid of it . If I touch it , something goes wrong . " " But Prentice has trained young Gatt . He 's a natural-born mechanic . "  | " And the bills ? " " Sell the steamer Prentice built . There 's not been as much use for it as we figured , although it was highly interesting putting it together . You ought to get three thousand for it . Elizabeth and I will sell our house and lot here , and go first to Pittsburgh . With the baby so young , I think it will be best for her to move there until I 'm settled again . " If only Thomas had not gone so quickly . Nothing moved as well or easily as he had so lightly predicted . Months passed . On that day , when Audubon came in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . But Audubon said , " All the notes Sneaders paid me for the steamer have been returned from Owensboro . All worthless . " Sneaders , with seven others , including McTag and Wright , had formed a company to buy the steamer . " I did not from the first wish to deal with Sneaders . But there were no other offers . " " If the notes are worthless , we 'll take back the steamer , " Lucy cried . " Sneaders has taken it himself and gone down to Orleans . Isham Talbot says I must regain possession of it , or there can be much litigation . I am going after them . I will take George to row . Gatt will have to tend the infernal mill . That is not good , but I can not afford to lose the three thousand for the steamer . " Three weeks later , Lucy saw Dr. Rankin come toward her front door . He frowned worriedly . " Yes , " Lucy said , " my husband returned last night . But the journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steamer . " " Lucy , Sneaders has returned also . He says your husband defamed his character in Orleans ; that was how the creditors knew he was there and seized the steamer . Sneaders is known to be a bully . He threatens to beat your husband . I must hurry off to a patient , but warn Audubon , will you ? " She ran to the mill . Light streaked in through small dusty high windows . In a water mill , one large simple wheel churned clean white water ; here , many small wheels , fussily dependent on some  | hidden cog , filled the air with a smell of hot grease and a deadly monotonous grind , whir and jar . The complexity of it filled her with uneasiness and confusion . Life had become like this  --  confused and fretful . She passed down the narrow stairs . On the unpainted poplar of the wall , she saw , drawn in heavy black pencil , a swallow . She was glad that at some moment , her husband , lifting his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she heard a cry . She ran . Gatt was running , too , and pulled down some lever . The machinery was silenced . Audubon , blood staining his shirt , turned a pain-contorted face toward her and Gatt said , " He caught his hand in the machinery . " " Come , Dr. Rankin 's in town . I 'll find him . " " Yes . But , Gatt , start the engine again . We must finish grinding this lot . We need the payment . " At home , she bound Audubon 's injured hand in clean linen and ran to the front windows , hoping to see Dr. Rankin passing . Instead , she saw three of Sneaders ' friends , armed with rifles , loitering at the front gate . She ran to the back . At the far end of the garden , watching the house , were two others . Just then Audubon said , " I 'll not wait for Rankin . I must go back . " Terrified she turned . " No , you ca n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish that wheat . " She had to tell him then of Dr. Rankin 's warning . " So , this blusterer threatens me ! And I 'm to get into bed and pull up the blankets ? A pity my right hand 's hurt . I could wish I had practiced to shoot with my left hand ! " " Please do n't go out there . " " Am I to be kept prisoner in my own house by this violent , dishonest man ? I need to go to my mill . I am going . " " Wait , then ! " She took down the dagger from the wall . It had been given them one night as . a gift by a traveler who asked for shelter , a Spaniard on his way to take part in a revolution in Central America . Now she looked at the long thin blade . " Here ! I put it in your belt on your left side . Perhaps when he sees the bandage , knows you are injured , he will not attack . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing beside their front gate , carrying a heavy club . " Please , do n't go ! " Audubon opened the door and went down the walk , opened his gate and turned into the street . Sneaders blocked his way . Then Sneaders raised the club . She closed her eyes . When she opened them a crowd had closed in . She saw the club flash up , heard the thud . Sneaders ' friends shouted . She ran out , but could not reach her husband . Dr. Rankin came running . Then someone cried , " Bring a plank ! " She beat her fists against the backs of the people in the rear of the crowd , but in vain . Then the crowd parted . Five men pushed forward , heaving and straining , carrying a plank . On it was not Audubon  --  but Sneaders . The sheriff ran up now , gun drawn . The crowd surged back . " There he is ! " It was crazy , unbelievable . The man the sheriff was marching roughly away was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling , cursing , " String him up ! It 's murder . He had a knife ! " " Let them have a trial , " Sneaders ' friends boasted . " It wo n't make any difference to us which way it goes . " Lucy was disturbed that the trial was held in the Tavern , and that Sneaders ' friends were armed . But when the judge entered she was relieved to see he wore a robe  --  dusty black , but full-sleeved and traditional . Then she saw , under the deal table , that he wore high boots , spurred . She sat erect . It did not do to appear to be intimidated by force . Her husband sat beside her , quivering with tension . Dr. Rankin testified , " Yes , the dagger wound might have been serious , but actually it was n't . It went in at an angle . " The victim 's huge bulk overflowed the chair . He wore elaborate bandages . " He do n't come at me like a man , but with a sneaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a queer one . Fellow like that do n't belong in a town like ours . " " Why did you belabor him with a club ? " the judge asked .  | " He went spreadin ' it around downriver my bills was no good . That 's defamation of my character . " " You claim he nearly killed you with a knife . But was n't he defending himself against your clubbing ? Joe Sneaders , you surely do n't expect me , in the great and sovereign state of Kentucky , to put a man in jail for defending himself ! By rights , he ought to have killed you ! I declare this man , Audubon , not guilty . Court dismissed . " There was a sound like a roar . The judge stood up and took off his robe . He was wearing a gun . He looked around . " Anyone planning any interference with justice in my court ? If I hear of any , it 'll be a sorry day for you , Sneaders ! " The canoe moved in sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It is times like this when a man knows what it means to have a good wife and a fine family . " " We 're going to spend the day together and out-of-doors , " Lucy had insisted after the trial . Now she held the picnic-basket high on her lap , away from the spray . " Our Victor paddles well , " Audubon said , not forgetting to smile approvingly at Johnny , too , who , along with the new dog , was learning to sit motionless and keep the canoe in balance . " There ! " Lucy pointed to the shore . The canoe turned in . Gallantly , she was helped to a smooth grassy spot . Watching her husband she thought , I 'm glad he 's an elastic man . The strain 's gone from his face , evaporated into the out-of-doors . She sat quietly , looking at her family . Yes , there were scowling rude men , full of hate and violence . And there were the tensions and strains of a husband and father doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also two boys with bright eyes , listening , rapt , as their father gave them instructions on the training of the new dog . And a father bending over his six-year-old son , showing him how to fasten bait , and telling his nine-year-old son how to tie his fish-line to a long willow branch . I late and violent men were true . But not more true than Victor ,  | turning , as they ate , to see if his fish-line dipped . Not more true than the feeling of close warmth as her husband touched her hand . One had to keep all in focus . CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO ELIZA BAKEWELL BERTHOUD had journeyed downriver from Louisville to visit her sister . Eliza 's first child , Mary , played around their wide-spreading skirts and Lucy could reach out a hand to rock the cradle of her new three-month-old daughter Rosa . Now that Victor was ten , he was off about manly affairs , but Lucy rose to glance into the street at Johnny rolling a hoop and to see to a rack of candles she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wife were pitying you , saying how worn you were and poor-furnished , " Eliza said , " I felt wretched . But I think your house pleasant ! Why , you even have a piano ! " " Yes , and we 've bought an additional lot , too . But , " Lucy sighed , " my husband works hard at the steam-mill . Work that 's not really congenial takes a toll . Sometimes  --  I ca n't explain it  --  hut a great sadness comes over me , as at something gone wrong , something wasted . I used , often , to be vexed that he seemed to have more of an eye for any bird than for me . But now  --  well , sometimes I hear the mill stop , know that terrible engine has broken down again . I 'm glad . I hope he 'll go out-of-doors , or find a new bird . " " You mean he still draws birds as he did when we were chil-dren ? " Lucy touched four large portfolios , stuffed full . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has hundreds of drawings again . They 're very fine . " She looked at a drawing on the wall .  | " Once when the mill broke , he had to work all night . But then , coming home at dawn , he found this sandpiper . Somehow all the worry and strain has not dulled his eye or hand . " The sisters ' voices wove on , bright braids of sound . " Lucy , is it possible you 're still wearing one of the stuff gowns made for your trousseau ? You 've let out the waist ! " " No . I wear it occasionally , like today , out of over-weening vanity . And should my poor husband fail to exclaim in amazement , I remind him , I 'm thirty-two , have had four children and may still wear my marriage dresses . ' " " Oh , you 're like Aunt Gifford . At eighty , she was still straight as a guardsman . " Eliza sighed . " My mother-in-law does not fail to tell me that , since the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having Madame Berthoud for a mother-in-law ! How fine that must be ! " " Sometimes I wonder if the relationship does not create its own natural antipathy . " " But women of character like yourself and Madame Berthoud get over it . " " Ye-es . One often sees a dog and cat get on . " " Oh , Lize ! What a joy it is to have you ! It does me immense good ! And to think we 'll have a whole week to talk ! " Eliza looked out the doorway . " Lucy , you have gillyflowers ! 1 remember ours under the window in Bakewell . To think we 've children of our own , and live in the state of Kentucky . Is n't it strange ? " They waited tea , but Audubon did not come . Lucy said , " There is some trouble at the moment . I hope it has all come round . We 'll have our tea . " " Lucy , " Liza cried out , " it 's the china from Crith . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters rose to see their children off to bed , to wash faces , hear prayers and cajole them with the notion that tomorrow , too , could be wonderful . When Audubon returned , Lucy knew by his face the trouble had not straightened itself out . Indeed , they had just finished  | supper , and Victor had gone to bed , when visitors arrived . Three men , McTag , Wright and Sneaders , who owned the new bank . " You borrowed money from the bank , Audubon , to buy the equipment to cut the wood , with the timber as surety . Now you let the whole thing slip through your hands . With the timber gone , the land 's worthless , and besides , you even owe for it . What do you propose to do ? " Wright asked . " I have outstanding accounts . Money is owed me by several agents up and down the river . " " Might as well tell you now , Audubon , " McTag said , " things is at a state where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency printed by any other banks . Our own  --  or cash dollars , that 's all . " " Do n't think there 's anything personal in this , " Wright said . " We all know you and Sneaders here had trouble , but that 's got nothing to do with this . " Sneaders ' smile was sour . " Not a single thing . " " You borrowed the bank 's money . You lost the surety . We 're left unprotected . " " To show you there 's nothing personal in it , " Sneaders smiled , " we 'll give you a week . " " A week ! " Audubon exclaimed . " Naw , give him three weeks , " McTag said . " Of course there 's been times when we 've thought he has n't done much for the town , but we wo n't be mean . Three weeks . " They went away . " Ah , that mill , " Audubon said . " It 's like a minotaur with grinding teeth that consumes me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I do not speak its language . I 'll go back there tonight . See what I can do . " When he had gone Lucy said , " How sorry I am , Eliza , you have run into all this storm . " " Indeed , I 'm not ! It 's a lucky thing I was here ! Do you think for a minute the Berthouds would see you in need of help and do nothing ? Now , tell me exactly what happened . " " Well , a short time ago we had a chance to buy a hundred  | acres of timber cheaply . Then a bargeload of Yankees stopped here , offering to do the cutting . They said they were loggers from York State . It seemed providential . The timber was to go to our mill for sawing . Shipped to Orleans , it should have brought a good profit . " " But that sounds most sensible ! " Eliza cried . " Yes , but we had to go into debt at the bank here to buy crosssaws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , two nights ago , we discovered the Yankees had cut all the timber , made a raft and gone off downriver , taking everything , even the saws and oxen . " " What a dreadful thing ! " " Yes . A steam-mill , I must tell you , dear Eliza , is a fret and strain . Mr. Page invested in the mill , but he 's in Pittsburgh . He advised us to secure agents up and down the river to buy grain and lumber on commission and to sell our milled goods . But this has been a nightmare because of the currency . When we first came , the Kentuckians abhorred the very word bank . ' Then they made a law they could print their own money , and now there are banks , banks , everywhere . Even in this little town . Those men who were here own it . One of them  --  because of a past trouble I 'll not distress you with  --  is unfriendly to my husband . " " I must set off for home at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry . " " Perhaps it is best . Indeed , I do n't know where else to turn . " " Eventually , of course , " Eliza said , " your husband will have his father 's fortune . I 've often wondered about that . He is still alive ? " " He died lately in Nantes . At ninety-one . But ? " Lucy hesitated . Except her father , Miss Smith and herself , no one at Fatland had known of Audubon 's clouded birth . " His father 's will , though carefully drawn , has been attacked . " The litigation had arisen because Audubon , though adopted , was a natural son . A fight would be necessary and Lucy feared having the matter all brought up again . Indeed , at times when affairs at the mill baffled and frustrated him , Audubon would mutter , " Some uncertain blood keeps me from doing anything well . " Would n't his confidence be  | further diminished if all the insecurity were made public ? No money was worth that . Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be anything from that quarter . " " All the more reason I should hurry to get help then , " Eliza said . " I 'll leave the first thing in the morning . " One day about a month after Eliza left , Lucy rose , gave Rosa the breast and saw that Audubon had gone out . Surely , today , there 'd be a letter . The Berthouds would not fail them . At breakfast , Victor asked , " Mama , what did those men want last night ? " " Oh , you were not asleep ? " " They woke me up with their yelling at Papa . What money ? " How did one know when a boy was old enough to be told facts ? The truth , that his parents were worried , he would already have picked up . Was it fair to say to a fine intelligent boy like Victor , " You 're too young to understand . " She said , " The men were angry about debts your father owes , but gold is all anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish I had a lot of gold . " Audubon came in then . He had the letter . " At last , it 's come , " she flew to him . He handed her the opened letter . Something about his look made her say , " Now , Victor , you take Johnny , and outdoors , please . " Celia brought in Audubon 's breakfast but he did not eat . Lucy opened the letter and read : Dear Friends : It is a sad day when you come to the Berthouds for help and do not receive it . But the Louisville Bank has gone down , and we are short , too . Even The Tarascons can not do anything . This diabolic currency ! Word comes to us of a bill before the state legislature to declare a moratorium on all debts , but there is also a strong anti-relief party . If you could persuade your creditors to wait , we may in a few months have some specie in our hands and can help you . . . .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted . " It is known I received the letter . No doubt the honorable bankers will be here soon to inquire . " " Then do try to eat . You must try at least . " There was a knock . It was a commission agent , Mr. Lucas . " It 's about my account for the hemp bags for grain . I hear you were able to borrow some more capital , and if you can arrange to pay , I 'd be obliged . " There were voices outside , heavy steps , then a sharp knock . Four men came in , McTag , Wright , Sneaders and a fourth man Lucy did not know . " Well , Audubon ! We heard you got the money . Thought we better make sure it did n't git drained off someplace else . Our claims are first ! " They glared at Lucas . " I have received no money , " Audubon said . " Why , we know you got a letter , " Sneaders broke out . " My friends could send no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You got a nerve asking us to wait any longer . " " The town practically gave him a valuable mill site . Why ca n't he make a go of it ? " The exasperated voices , the frowning , outraged faces seemed to Lucy fixed . To these men he would always be the exasperating , the outrageous . " We were fools to lend him a cent . " " If it was n't for his crazy ways , he would n't get into such a fix . " " Sell him up , I say . Why wait ? I want my money , " Sneaders said . Mr. Wright looked around the room . " He goes into debt , yet look at the things here . A piano . Silver , if you please . Very fine and elegant . White linen on the table . Always wears a linen shirt . Tow does for me . And all the time , he acts as if business was n't important , as if we money-grubbers were the fools . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want my money . Some may have grudges , but it 's purely a business deal with me . " " The mill 's worth something , " Sneaders said . " It could be sold . " " If you would consent to give me more time , " Audubon said .  | " We gave you too much already . " They whispered together . Then McTag said , " We 're going to the bank and talk it over . " They filed out . Wright was last and he turned . " In the meantime , do n't try running off with any assets . " Lucy said finally , " The Rankins are our friends . " " But the doctor has no cash , " Audubon said . " No , I guess it is all in land and slaves . " The baby began to cry and Lucy picked her up . " Well , " Audubon said , " I guess there is nothing to do but go to the mill , try to saw more lumber and hope to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , please come home for dinner . " When he had left , Lucy moved briskly about the kitchen . " Celia , we must have an especially fine dinner today . Let us begin with turtle soup . You know Mr. Audubon loves it . " Before the three o'clock dinner hour , she put on her best frock and set flowers on the table . Somehow , both Victor and Johnny sensed they ought to be quiet and well-behaved . Audubon came on time , as he had promised . " What do I care for these men ? I have this fine family ! That is what is important . No one can take that . Ah , turtle soup ! " They had just finished their meal when a man came to the door . He followed Celia in . He was a stranger , with high riding boots . " John Audubon ? " " Yes . " You are under arrest . " " Arrest ! " Lucy tore at him . " No , no . What for ? " Victor cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant . It 's for nonpayment of legal debts . Nine names on it . " " But how can he pay the debts if they take him away and he ca n't run the mill ? " Lucy cried . " Ma'am , I 'm the sheriff , not the judge . Could we be gettin ' under way ? Be a long ride . " " Ride ? Where are you taking me ? "  | " To Louisville . " " Louisville ! But why ? " " There 's no debtors ' prison here . Got to go to the Louisville Gaol . " Audubon stood , very white . Then he went and got his cloak and his hat and put them on . Lucy did not cry . " I 'll find the money somehow , " she said . He kissed her . " Victor , take care of your mother . " " If you 're ready , " the sheriff said . Johnny broke into loud wails , but Victor took her hand . " Mama , I 'm here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the gate , another man waited , leading an old nag . Audubon mounted it . He turned to look back as he rode off between the two men . " When will he come back , Mama ? " Victor asked . " I do n't know . But everything must go on just the same . When he returns , he 'll find it so . " Next morning , as soon as she finished nursing the baby , she put on her shawl . " Victor , this morning , you must hear Johnny 's lessons . Do n't be too severe on him . I am going to the mill . " The wheels rumbled and groaned . Gatt , the mechanic , blinked out of a grease-stained face . " Yes , ma'am , I 'll try to keep it goin ' just as usual . Least as long as I can . " A large ledger rested on her husband 's table . She feared she would not be able to make much sense of the accounts , but she opened it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Henry Lecky , 2000 board feet oak , sawed for Consolidated Land Co. all written in her husband 's hand . But she was staring at something else . Occupying the whole lined page , and drawn directly over the columns of figures was a penciled hummingbird swinging in a , trumpet vine . As she stared , , the superimposed picture seemed to , stand out vividly , fresh and alive . She had to concentrate to read ; the figures behind it .  | She said finally , " Mr. Gatt , do you think it would help if I went to these people who owe us money ? " " No , I do n't . He 's already tried them all . " That night , when the children were in bed , the house was still and she sat alone with a terrifying , breathless feeling she should be doing something . But what ? She 'd heard tales of debtors languishing for years in debtors ' prison . Like a recurrent nightmare she could hear the exasperated voices of the men denouncing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their outraged faces . In a panic she sat down and wrote a letter : Dear Father : Today , my husband was arrested . They took him to the Louisville gaol . If only .. . It would take months to get a reply . She tore up the letter . The little girl cried and she soothed her , the tiny baby whose chin set in some strange comic way rather like Aunt Gifford 's . There 's no place to turn , she thought . But there has to be an island of steadiness somewhere so the children will feel it and can cling to it . And Laforest , too , when he returns . I will have to build that island of steadiness within me . CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE THEN , OLD Mr. Berthoud himself came right into the Louisville gaol , " Audubon stood in the house in Henderson . " He advised me to do it . " Lucy held one of his hands tight in hers . " I took his advice , went into the court and signed a paper . I declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free ? " " Yes , I am free . " " Why do those men wait ? " Lucy looked , terrified , at the two who had ridden with him here , and waited now outside the door . " One does not walk free for nothing . Everything we own must be sold to be divided among the creditors . " " The mill , yes ? " she faltered . " But  --  the house ? " He looked at her . " Everything . " " Soon ? " " Tomorrow . But listen , I 'll not sit idle . I 'll find some way to make a living . Now , I 'm going to ride off at once to Dr. Rankin 's , to ask if you and the children may stay at Meadowbrook until I ? I 'm able to manage . I 'll go to Louisville , a larger place . There I may find an opening . " " Yes , " Lucy nodded . " Yes . It 's a good plan . " When he had gone she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in control , she rose and moved briskly . " Celia ! Bring in all our portmanteaus . We must pack . " She concentrated on a job to be done . When her husband returned he said , " Dr. Rankin is in Owensboro . Sally will be expecting you and the children tomorrow . " It was the first time they had been together in many weeks . It was the last night they would spend in this house . He knelt beside the bed and prayed aloud . His prayers when she heard them both embarrassed her and made her weep . They were so fervid . " Heavenly Father , " he prayed , " all those weeks in the gaol , in the filth and perversion , among the thieves and murderers , I have had time to understand I have lost many things , but you have left to me my great strength  --  my wife and my family . Somewhere , I made a wrong turn . Help my feet find the right one . " And she prayed silently , " Dear God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " What a miracle life was ! Even in trouble , in anguished worry , there could be love . Now , after eleven years , they could love each other with a sure grasp of the other 's need . All those bad things  | that happen are outside us . We still have this . Inside us , we are not hurt . Next morning , the island firm , she went on with the packing . Audubon said , " There are many large empty boxes at the mill . I 'll bring them . " She counted the silver out on the table . By the time she had folded and stacked the linen tablecloths , the lovely bed sheets , the ; hand-loomed counterpanes , Audubon had come with the boxes . She put the silver in the first box . " I think I 'll use the linens to wrap the china ? " The door opened without a knock . A bailiff , a sad dull-looking man , thrust his head in . " What 's them boxes for ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my china . " " Do n't . " " But you ca n't ? " " Do n't pack it . That 's the law . Take your clothes . Nothing else . " He went out and closed the door . She and her husband looked at each other . Then came the frightening realization , " Everything in the house ! The portfolios ! " She dashed toward them and so did he . Now , instead of feeling helpless as they had yesterday , they were galvanized with something to be done  --  that must be done . The portfolios must be saved . " Dr. Rankin , " cried Lucy , " he 'll come in and bid on them . " " He will not return from Owensboro until next week ! " " Sally ! " " Yes , but three miles out and back . And she might not be there . " " The young minister ! " Audubon ran off , but returned shortly . " He has gone into the country to preach at a funeral and wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . He has n't much himself , but ? ! " " I 'll go with you , " Lucy said . " If he is n't there , we can then decide what to do . "  | The Carmarthans were at home . Their small mud-calked cabin seemed crowded . They had three children and expected another . Because Carmarthan was a city man , not clever with gun and rod and therefore dependent on his pittance of salary , they seemed poorer than their neighbors . " Anything , anything we have , dear friends ! " Carmarthan had jumped up , distressed . He turned his pockets out , empty . " Alas ! " Then Mrs. Carmarthan lifted a stone in the fireplace and brought up a dusty tow bag . " I been puttin ' it away , bit by bit , for the one comin ' . " She pressed the bag into Lucy 's hand . " You forget now , but I remember it  --  how once when we needed it , you gave us a goldpiece . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " She looked in . She guessed it was about twenty dollars . But in gold  --  the only thing the auctioneer would take . She handed it to Carmarthan . " What we need is for you to come with this and when the portfolios are put up , to bid on them . " Carmarthan snatched up his hat . " I understand . Let 's pray it 's enough . " Early in the proceedings Lucy discovered how to manage . It was to make herself numb . The numbness stood her in good stead as the auctioneer called out jokes and each chair , each curtain went . She kept erect , face expressionless when he called out , " Fine lady 's pianoforte . What am I bid ? " " Five boxes of books " Fine lot of silver and linen ? " How strange ! The piano and silver went to Mr. Wright , who , only a few weeks before , had ridiculed and denounced them for being so fine . But the numbness vanished and tears came when she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A stranger bought it , someone off a boat landed to take on provisions . Pleased with his prize , he carried it off at once . The Crith china was gone and that was over . But  --  the portfolios ? She  | quivered , looking at her husband , and prayed , Let Carmarthan 's gold be enough ! " Fine double-barreled shotgun . What 's offered ? " " Now , that ai n't right , " a man protested . " Not to sell a man 's gun ! No ! " Others chorused . " No , that ai n't right ! " " All right , all right . I do n't want any arguments , " the auctioneer cried . " Here , take it , " and he threw the gun toward Audubon . " Let 's get on , then ! " The four large shabby portfolios were stacked one on top of the other . " What 's this ? " He untied one , looked inside . " Pictures . " Lucy saw Audubon standing rigid and white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whole mess of pretty pictures . Anybody interested ? " Someone let out a jeering laugh , another joined . Then someone yelled , " Naw ! Let 's get on with the sale . " The auctioneer tied up the strings . " All right , then . Nobody wants them , so I guess they ai n't worth nothin ' . Here , take them out of my way . " He shoved the portfolios aside . Lucy saw her husband 's hands tremble as he started toward them . Just then a man yelled , " Hey , wait a minute ! Lemme see them ! " Carmarthan took a step forward , tense . The man untied one , looked in . " Oh , for pity sake ! A lot of birds ! Go on , take them . " Audubon carried them into the next room . " Fine bedstead . What am I offered ? " It seemed part of some dream that neighbors and strangers were carrying away , in carts , or on their backs , familiar chairs and tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of mourning the loss of these things , Lucy had an inexplicable sense of triumph , and when Audubon came back into the room and their eyes met , she saw her secret triumph was shared . Victor demanded that day , as he had every day in the two months they had been at the Rankins ' , " When will Papa come ? " Finally , Lucy could smile and say , " We are to go to him ! " She  | read Victor the letter that had come , not from Louisville , but Cin-cinnati : My beloved wife : At last , a ray of light ! Through our true friends the Berthouds , I have secured a fine position . It is not in the mercantile line , but in taxidermy . Remember , long ago , when I did this in New York for the good Dr. Mitchell ? Old Mr. Berthoud heard a museum was planned in Cincinnati , and Mr. Tarascon knew Dr. Drake , who is the President here . In short , there was correspondence , I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $125 a month ! Ah , my dear one , is this not a fine white lining in the cloud ? Canst thou come here at once ? Kiss my sons and my daughter . Soon we will all be together again ! All their luck seemed to have turned , for Senator Talbot , who had hired a comfortable barge to take him upriver on his way to Washington City , offered to carry Lucy and the children all the way to Cincinnati . Only Mistress Sally Rankin looked thoughtful . " Lucy , the baby is so small . Wait three or four months until summer . " " It would not do . How glad the boys will be to see their father . " She replied to her husband 's letter : ... and we have a fine opportunity to travel on Senator Talbot 's barge . Dr. Rankin is of opinion that even though Rosa is frail she will stand the journey because she is at breast and I will not have to seek strange food for her . I have thought much of all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us profit from lessons here and contract no debts . But now that you will have a salary  --  and to speak truth it will be a relief to have some fixed sum  --  you will see how well I can manage . Senator Talbot says to tell you we should reach Cincinnati by Friday the week . Your loving friend and wife , Lucy Audubon  | On the final day , she stood on the barge , the baby in her arms , and Victor and Johnny beside her . She waved back , smiling and happy , at the Rankins . In a few minutes the barge passed under the mill . She could see the lettering : " J. J. Audubon &; Co . " " What will it be like in Cincinnati , Mama ? Like Henderson ? " " No , " she said firmly . " Different . Quite different . "  | Part Four CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR VICTOR HAD TRAPPED the muskrat but John , who was only seven , had drawn it . " It 's truly very fine , John , " Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them bent over it . " We 'll place it here , just so , on your papa 's work-table . He will walk in , expecting nothing . Now , not a word ! " They could hear Audubon humming as he came . He opened the door and smiling , looked from one boy to the other . " Something is afoot ! Victor , are you not your papa 's friend ? Will you not tell me ? No ? Oh , well , I 've had great luck myself . I started for the Greens ' to do the portrait of the old man who was dying , when I heard the rasping note in a bog by the river . A snipe ! " He drew the bird from his game bag . " I followed him through swamps for a couple of hours before I could get a shot . I have him  --  but I missed the five dollars I should have had for the portrait ! " " Oh , " Lucy looked at the snipe , " a fine one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor John was dying of suspense . At the table , Audubon peered at the drawing . " What 's this ? Is my Victor so clever ? " " Victor caught him ! " Johnny said loyally . " Johnny ? Our Johnny drew it ! " Lucy nodded and at their father 's widened eyes , the boys  | shouted for joy . Suddenly , Audubon seized Lucy and waltzed around the room with her , singing loudly , " La , la , la ! " The boys tagged on , trying to dance with them . Now Audubon stopped to examine the drawing intently . " John , I now begin to give you drawing lessons ! My sweetheart , is it not a marvelous thing to be the parents of two such fine lads ? " There was a knock and Audubon opened the door . " Here are friends to cheer us . " It was Captain Cummings , Professor Whipple and the boy named Joseph Mason . Whipple , as usual , had been drinking ; Cummings would not want to leave him alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tongue in vitriol . Lucy guessed it was the liquor and the vitriol that had caused a man trained at Brasenose , Oxford , to be washed up on this obscure ledge to teach chemistry . Whipple said , " My dear Audubon , I have heard something which will make you laugh . Tomorrow , a government scientific expedition passes through here and Dr. Drake , president of the college I have the misfortune to be connected with , gives them a reception ! He hopes , no doubt , for some mention of his name in the eastern papers ! " Captain Cummings , a man about Audubon 's age , stroked his long mustache . Lucy was vague as to whether his title came from service with the army engineers or from having been master of a river vessel . " I 'd like to go on such an expedition , " he said . " The main exploring 's over , but there 's a lot to be done . We have n't a really detailed map of the Mississippi  --  all the eddies and bends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd like to do that ! " " How very American ! " Whipple laughed . " The British organize these large tasks with a Hudson 's Bay Company , or an East India Company . But Americans want to do the thing single-handed . Else where 's the glory ? " " It 's a dream , " said Cummings , who had mild blue eyes . " A big dream . " " A dream ought to be big , " Audubon said , " otherwise what is its use ? Otherwise why not eat your food and drink your grog and go to sleep and get up and think of nothing but that ? " " You 've become more American than the Americans , " Whipple 's  | smile tried to wound . " They confuse empty , grandiose ideas with reality . In Europe it is understood that it takes generations of scholars to accrete a museum . But Dr. Drake thinks he can take a few mammals , a few bird-skins , hire some poor devil here like Audubon , who , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , even go into debt for the material to have a few glass cases thrown together by a native in a fur cap . Then your Dr. Drake announces in the so-called learned journals in the East , the founding of the Western Museum of America , in an unused room of a frame building of this so-called College . " Perhaps the cutting edge of truth in the sneering voice made Lucy want to deny it . She said , " When we came through Pittsburgh , ten years or more ago , it was mostly log huts . But a man there had made a beautiful glass candelier . It was like an idea , hanging from nothing . I believe there are houses built around the chandeliers now . " " wive le chandelier ! " Audubon cried . Tea was ready and Lucy served it . At first she had been surprised to discover that earthenware cups , cotton teacloth , and pewter spoons did not lessen enjoyment of good friends and talk . Now that these things were firmly in their minor place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she poured from a battered teapot . Cummings , a practical , literal man was saying , " Maybe Drake flies a little high . But it 's a fact you have to make your plan before you get a bridge . And what 's worse than a plan that 's too small ? Make it big , dream big . I do n't want to map Limestone Creek . I want to do the whole Mississippi Basin . " " Ah , my friend , " Audubon glanced up , " there is more room to move in a fine large dream . Let us dream it . Let us suppose I am very rich . What would I do ? I would charter a good vessel for my friend Captain Cummings , with excellent instruments aboard , food , a cook , helpers . Going along with him , naturally , is his friend , Audubon , who , though without zoological training , is not ignorant of the bird life of America . The captain makes useful maps of all the tributaries . Audubon collects with his dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also has his large-sized dream . Nothing less than to collect and figure every bird in America ! " Seventeen-year-old Joseph Mason , who had attached himself to Audubon ever since he had seen him making a portrait in the tavern , said , " If you 'd take me , I could make drawings , too , as well as care for the dogs and cook . " " Of course , Joseph . " Audubon 's gesture was ample . They were afloat , each in his own galleon , on halcyon seas . " But why ? " Whipple 's voice pricked bubbles . " What good would it do you ? " " How can you quarrel with another person 's dream ? " Lucy smiled , feeling sorry for him . The tea was drunk and Audubon began work on his snipe . The party was breaking up . Whipple said , " Audubon , did I remember to tell you an official ukase has been issued that everyone connected with the College or the Museum  --  and their wives ? must be on hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Drake means to put on a good show . " " Better if he worried more about paying salaries , " Audubon said . " Come for the amusement anyway . These yahoos have factions ! That you may not miss the fun , watch a Mrs. Traubel . Her husband may yet be president here ! " Is was almost three . Joseph Mason had come to stay with Victor and John . " Ready , sweetheart ? " Audubon 's black coat was greening , but his high stock had a distinguished air , and his good shirt looked well . Lucy had ironed the pleats beautifully . He regarded her , smiling , " As always , my Lucy is neat and sweet and charming . " She smiled back , realizing she did n't really care about a new bonnet ; what she really wanted was that he be proud of her . And she had only to look into his eyes to know he was  --  tenderly proud . " I invited Cummings , " Audubon said . " Think how he 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map , and to study flora and fauna in the upper Mississippi . And , Lucy , " Audubon laughed , " I hear there was a large squabble as to the place of this reception .  | The Library ? Or the Museum ? But no doubt they think these scientific gentlemen can not read . The Museum won . " " If the Museum won , it 's because they think you 've arranged it in a way to do them credit ! " " The man who leads them , Dr. Say , is an entomologist , quite renowned , I hear , and there is also with them an artist , Titian Peale , of Philadelphia . " In the crowded room in the new building , where an odor of raw wood still lingered , each lady in the receiving line had the air of king winner of a savage bloody battle for place . Someone introduced a , " Mrs. Traubel ! " Lucy shook hands . The lady had eyes tender as granite , a Boston finishing-school voice and a brocade randclasp wn resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to weigh every guest , setting each aside as useful or non-useful . Then Mrs. Traubel introduced , " Dr. Say , " a whitehaired gentleman with kindly , absent eyes . Next it was , " Major Long , of the Army Engineers . " His drooping mustache was like Captain Cummings ' . Then , " Mr. Titian Peale . " At last , Lucy was free to look about . She had not been here before . In cases and shelves , the stuffed fish , birds and mammals crc beautifully arranged , as was everything her husband touched . a moment , she thought of the little museum he had once made the attic at Mill Grove . By now the receiving line had broken up . Her husband stood on the edge of a group pressing around the visitors . His face had a hungry look . Suddenly she realized what seeing these men must mean to him . They were everything he was not , but passionately wished to be . A scientist and an artist , starting out on a wellequipped expedition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in America , in the year 1820 , it was such and such . She glanced away because it hurt her to see his face . Then she . heard Dr. Drake , " Audubon , show Dr. Say some of your collection . " Audubon flushed , then turned deadly pale . Lucy followed as he led them to one side of the room , where on his work-table , his portfolios , faded now to gray-green , were stacked . Each one was nearly four feet long and three feet wide . She saw his hand tremble  | as he untied the creased strings . The first drawing happened to be the blue heron stepping gingerly on a shore . Dr. Say stopped in the middle of a sentence . Perspiration stood on Audubon 's high forehead . He looked miserable , self-conscious and his hand still trembled . He turned the page . The parakeets were next . " Ask Mr. Peale to step here , " Dr. Say told an aide . Titian Peale came . Audubon turned the sheets . Peale stared . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you ? " Dr. Say asked finally . " Hundreds . At one time , I had nearly a thousand , but they were destroyed . I began again and with what more I had learned , these , I think , are better . " " Hundreds ! " Dr. Say and Peale looked at each other . Dr. Say 's eyes beamed with delighted astonishment . " Under whom did you study ornithology , my dear sir ? " " Under Nature only . " Peale , turning the drawings himself now , peered quizzically . " Have you ever heard of Alexander Wilson , the ornithologist ? " " Yes . He passed through Louisville once when I lived there . " More drawings were turned . From time to time , the visitors stared at each other , then at Audubon . Dr. Drake came then with , " Dr. Say , I regret we must leave for the ceremony at the town hall . These politicians , you know ! " From the door , Dr. Say returned to Audubon and extended a cordial hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If ever you 're in Philadelphia , be sure to call on me . " Lucy saw Audubon staring after him , with eyes strange and fiery . It was a fine walk home . Audubon , with his springing step , moved along quickly with Lucy 's hand pulled through his arm . They came into the falling-down , leaky little rented house , and Joseph Mason , who had been drawing a picture to amuse Johnny said , " Was it interesting , then ? " " Ah , Joseph , you should have been there . They were surprised at my birds ! "  | Lucy took off the pearl pin and the lace fichu and hoped there was something to cook for dinner . Joseph Mason said , " I shot two prairie chickens this morning . They 're plucked there by the fire , Mrs. Audubon . " They supped on stewed fowl . Lucy sat up straight , realizing she had been slack lately . She made the boys sit up straight , too . Bent pewter spoons and wooden trenchers or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Joseph had gone and the boys were in bed , Audubon said , touching her hair fondly , " I 'm glad we went into society this afternoon . It did thee good . My Lucy , many times in these late years , it would have been easy to say , I will cut my throat . But then , I would look at thee , smiling , thy figure still straight , and I would think  --  I have health , I am not devoid of talent , I have a wife that causes lilies to bloom in the spirit . I will go on . Whatever bad thing happened I could withstand it , as long as there were no reproaches from thee . " Lucy dropped her eyes , knowing that once she had failed him , her shoulders had come unstarched . It was after the second little girl , Rosa , had died , that first bitter cold winter of their arrival here . But , she 'd recovered , begun again ; life was ahead , not behind . She wanted to kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I keep thinking of those men this afternoon . Seeing their faces as they looked at your drawings . Hearing Dr. Say 's cordial , approving voice . " She hesitated , then said , " They mentioned Wilson . He once came into our store in Louisville , did he not ? " " Yes . I was about to subscribe to his work when Rozier stopped me  --  remember ? At the college here I find people know of Wilson and his work . And yet , Lucy , even then  --  ten years ago  --  I 'd collected more birds than Wilson . Seeing these men this afternoon stirs old longings . I hear that Titian Peale , who is accepted as a great painter of birds , sets up stuffed specimens he does not even collect , and draws them in his studio in the city . When I think how I 've followed these creatures in the forest , studied their food , mating , dwellings , and how even before I collect a bird I first study its  | ways , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of this  --  it seems my work must have some value . " Lucy said , " Wilson 's work was being published in Philadelphia . That 's how they know of him ! " " Yes . I often think of him . Poor Wilson ! Traveling sometimes on foot , living from day to day , meal to meal . He lived poor , he died poor , but he had a big dream . I 've had a big dream , too . A giant dream . Is it a wonder , seeing these men paid to do what I long to do that I ? " he broke off and sighed . " Many a time I 've thought If only I could earn my living doing what I love ! But it 's too late , of course , at thirty-five , to be starting . " " Starting ! Who is starting ? You said you had as many birds as Wilson ten years ago . I remember , now , the engravings he showed us . You have what he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the spirit lifts , seeing . " " My Lucy , sometimes I think thou art the only human being in the world who truly understands me . But I do not forget that comforts should be provided my family . I thought to be a prosperous merchant , a good provider , but at the same time , bring to pass the giant dream . How often I 've known it might be better for us if there were no such dream . But , beyond my will , it persists . " Long after they went to bed , she seemed to be hearing voices , the harmony of the voices that afternoon , of Dr. Say , Major Long and Mr. Peale . Drowning them out , a discord of other voices , angry , denouncing , rose  --  the men who had come to the house that day in Henderson , the creditors , demanding something her husband did not have . Then flooding over them , rose the astonished , cordial , approving voices of that very afternoon . When Lucy fell asleep , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dream was extraordinarily vivid . She seemed to be standing before an open ledger , the ledger she had seen in the mill at Henderson . She saw columns of figures in her husband 's writing , long lists of items bought and sold , then , superimposed over them , with startling clarity , the drawing of the hummingbird swinging in the trumpet vine . The vine was growing . As she stood at the warped window of a shaky little house , she could see the vine  | branching up and out , arching into a complex but beautiful pattern . From it came a sound like a rush of waters  --  birds singing in the vine : thrushes , mockingbirds , a phoebe . The vine roots bulged up , shaking the floor . She longed to be out of the make-do house , in the shade of the beautiful , burgeoning vine . The longing woke her up . Lying there , still with the pulsing sensation of the great vine growing underneath ( which had always been growing underneath ) , she said aloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It would be better if we lived in the vine . " The next morning she went about her chores , but the dream stayed with her . Its vividness grew instead of fading . She kept experiencing a sense of shock , recognizing , plain and startling , that the vine had always been there . Once she said out aloud , " What are we doing in this little house ? " When her husband came in , she was sitting beside the table staring . He said , " Well , sweetheart , for once , I see thee not busy . " " I 'm busier than I 've ever been in my life , " she said . " Sit down and listen to me . " She told him the dream . He listened intently , understanding at once it was important to her . When she finished she said , " Did you ever in a flash recognize something with certainty ? So now , I see  --  we must move into the vine . We should have long ago . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fit into an ordinary small house ? The roots of the vine have been growing in the foundations . What if you spent all your energies , your passion , on doing what you love ? Wilson became established as an ornithologist because his work was published . What I see clearly is that somehow , in some way your work must be made known . It , too , must be published . " " Ah , my Lucy , it brings tears to the eyes that thou seest the giant dream . But , even if it were possible , the collection is not ready . There are so many places I 've never been  --  the Rocky Mountains , Florida , the southern reaches of the Mississippi Valley . " " First , one has to have the dream . Then , make it actual . " " Even to fill out the collection would take many , many months . And in the meantime , what would become of my family ? " She left off because the bread dough she had set that morning  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she had finished kneading and shaping she said , " Dr. Drake and the Western Museum owe us money . How strangely things work out . Surely now , he must pay . That sum , managing as thriftily as I can , is enough to keep the boys and myself for many months . " He looked away ; finally he said , " When one is on the bottom , one may as well dream the giant dream . I might start out alone , on foot , like Wilson . The birds are all there , waiting for my pencil . " When Captain Cummings dropped in that afternoon , he , too , caught fire . " If you would consider collecting along the Mississippi first , we might join forces . Make our own expedition ! Two guns would be better than one to provision us and we could live off the country . If we could somehow get hold of a small boat . " They talked , the boys listening , open-mouthed . The atmosphere of the shabby crooked house seemed changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must first make certain the Museum will pay its debts . But Dr. Drake is a man interested in science . If I state it clearly , perhaps he will make an effort . " He took up his hat . Lucy said , " You 've talked to him before . It is too easy for him to put you off . Confronted with the mother of a family , he will understand he must do something . I 'll go . " Lucy stood very straight as she faced Dr. Drake . She had had a hard time finding him . He practiced as a physician , was attempting to found a medical school and in addition was partner in two commission firms . Now Dr. Drake said , " I consider your husband 's idea of filling out his collections a splendid one . I hope he succeeds in publishing . " Lucy cried out , " But do n't you see , it depends on our getting the money due us ! " " To be frank , it 's internal politics . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of clipping my wings . At present I can do nothing . Perhaps in three or four months circumstances will have changed . "  | Lucy walked home slowly . Dr. Drake 's vague promise was not enough , and she knew it . If only there were something she could do to tide them over until he paid . If she had an instrument , she might teach piano . If she had some pupils . When she came into the changed , charged atmosphere of the little house , she heard her husband 's eager voice , " The one essential expense will be shot , " and Cummings ' reply , " I agree . " She knew she must find a way . Her husband looked up . " Do we go on planning or not ? ' " Do n't worry . Listen , do you remember this  --  it 's something I 've often read you from Goethe : " What you can do , or dream you can , begin it ; Boldness has genius , power and magic in it . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the work will be completed . " He looked at her quizzically . " He gave the money ? " " Not today . But it 's all going to work out . " Cummings said at once , " Fine ! Our big problem then , is to get bold of a boat .... " Lucy came up the front walk of Mrs. Traubel 's house on Third Street . The brass knocker was a female hand holding a rose . Lucy had not slept much the night before . She had tried to think it all through . She did not give herself much credit for insight in understanding that Mrs. Traubel liked power , would readily sponsor something she could issue edicts about . Lucy feared , though , there might be prejudice against her English speech and manners . As soon as she began to talk to Mrs. Traubel , Lucy could see it was rather the opposite . She said , " My father was most thorough in our education , and I have experience in the teaching of young children . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense would he less for everyone . " What had worried her greatly was the smallness of her shabby house , the lack of chairs . " If I could bring my own sons , the class might be conducted in the home of one of the scholars . "  | Mrs. Traubel seemed to be considering interesting possibilities . " Of course , you ought not take just anyone . " Lucy said without hesitation , " I wondered if you would be kind enough to give me the advantage of your superior judgment about that ? " Mrs. Traubel 's jaw set joyfully . " Hmm . The Treats , the Adamses , the Jenkins , yes . But there are others  --  no ! What will your fees be ? " Lucy understood the taxidermist 's wife in her mended gloves would not be expected to charge much . She had thought about it during the night . It did not do to undervalue onself . And if she could not earn enough to support herself and the boys while her husband was gone , the whole idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of six scholars , then two dollars a week each will be sufficient . " " Oh ! " Mrs. Traubel looked surprised . Then , on consideration , she seemed to like the idea of a high fee . " Yes . If they ca n't afford it , let them go elsewhere . Now , if you will leave everything in my hands ? Good ! Come back tomorrow . " Hurrying home , Lucy 's steps were quick and light . She knew she had been able to teach the Rankin children . And Mrs. Traubel would surely find six scholars . She opened her own door . Her husband stood facing her , a dark scowl on his face . " Today on the street , Dr. Drake stops me and says he is sorry he had to tell my wife he could not pay the money due . Why let me plan ? Why so cruel ? " Lucy took a long breath and sat down . " Because I was bound we 'd go ahead with our plans . I knew I 'd think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rankins ' , you know I was successful in teaching the younger children . Victor and Johnny learn from me , too . Even at Fatland , I taught Ann and William . This is a useful skill . Why should I not use it , now , when we need it ? It 's only for six months or so ! " He was silent . She stole a glance at him , then went on , " If you become known and established as an ornithologist , do n't you see we 'll all be happier in the end ? It 's just good sense . Today , I talked to Mrs. Traubel . She says she 's sure she can find six scholars . With  | a regular class , an established income , the boys and myself will manage here very well . " " But what if ? " Lucy broke in , " First we dream the dream , then we make it happen . " His scowl was fading . " Yes . That is true . " He sat down . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will all be happier . " He looked at her soberly . " I should be glad I have such a wife . " Now with a great spurt , all the talk , the plans , speeded up . Late at night Lucy would hear Cummings declare , " We ought to go down the Red River . " " Yes , " Audubon would say , " then through Arkansas . " Joseph Mason became infected . " My father says if it 's no extra expense to him I may go . I 'm eighteen now . If there 's rowing , I could lend a hand , and I can shoot . " " Yes , " Audubon agreed . " And more than that , Joseph , you could help with drawings . I could teach you much as we went . " Joseph Mason joined the expedition . Victor demanded , " Could n't I go , papa ? " His father said , " It would be an education . " " What are you thinking of ? " Lucy cried out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . I too , can shoot . " " No , " Lucy said firmly . " No . " " Well , in truth , your mama is perhaps right . It will be rough . " In a few days , the formidable Mrs. Traubel reported she had hand-picked six scholars , three of them at the primer stage . Lucy had no doubt she could help them . But the others were of varying ages . She had not much confidence or experience there  --  only a determination that she must succeed . While Audubon made portraits when he could get orders , and instructed in drawing when he could find pupils , he developed his plans . Lists were made , maps studied . Then , one day , the letter came . Seeing it on the table , Lucy had a chill premonition . It was from Fatland , from her father . When Audubon came in , they read it together .  | I have heard through our friends and now relatives , the Berthouds , that you plan on setting out wandering over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The notion , even softened as it has been by the Berthouds , appears lacking in responsibility . You are now thirty-five and I believe we have a right to expect you to have settled to something . I know you have had many strokes of ill-fortune . That is why I have been exerting myself to see what I could do from here . I heard of an excellent opening with the firm Darnley &; Company . They are to open a branch in St. Louis to deal in lumbers and furs . A man is required to act as clerk and tend the books , with every chance of being taken into the firm later , if suited . I have spoken to them about you . I am assured the place can be yours . However , they can hold it open for only a short time . The salary , a hundred dollars a month , is moderate , but the firm is sound and employment steady . Mr. Darnley asks that you report to him at once when you arrive in St. Louis . On consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter and my grandchildren in Cincinnati alone , and I presume unprovided for , is reckless in the extreme . Audubon stared at the letter . Then his shoulders hunched down . " Reckless ! " His eyes were hurt and somber . " Irresponsible ! " He stood up . " He is right ! " Before she could stop him , he hurried out of the house . He did not return for several hours , and then his voice was gloomy and subdued as he said , " I had to tell Cummings and Joseph at once that I can not go . " " But , my darling , listen ! " " Not now . I must go quickly to see about our passage to St. Louis . " " Wait ? " " If I am not prompt , they 'll say , as always , I do not tend to business . Thou had best begin to pack immediately . " He left the house . Lucy stood defeated . With leaden movements she went to the other room and pulled a battered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  | pack . Then she stopped . She sat down , hands between her knees . " Whither thou goest ? " Aunt Gifford would say . And from Philadelphia to Louisville to Henderson to Cincinnati , I 've been using the ideas of an old lady whose duties as wife to an English rector had been clearly marked out for generations ! This is a newer place , a different time . I 'm different , too , from when I left Fatland . What a lot I 've seen ! Not all of it I 've understood , but I ca n't have been such a failure or I would not still have the devotion of this priceless human being , this strange , intense man that I married . Ought I not by now be ready to take the responsibility for what my own spirit tells me ? She heard her husband come in and she went into the main room . His face was gloomy . " I have the passage for tomorrow . How goes the packing ? " " I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned , astonished , but she went on , " Listen , my dearest ! I 'm a woman of good common sense , everyone remarks it . Why should you alone have to take responsibility for our direction ? And the onus of failure ? Why should I follow with eyes closed ? Instead , I ought to be walking beside you , saying , Consider this road ! Or that ! Before my father sent that letter  --  interposing his way , which is good and right for him  --  did we not both agree we must live out our own pattern ? " " Yes , but ? " " Let us not be deflected ! " Audubon looked at her a long time . Then he went to her and kissed her hard . " Somehow in my heart I feel that to go ahead with the giant dream will in the end be best for us all ! " " We are agreed then ! " " Not that 's it 's going to be easy . " " We have our health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be done , it will be . " He kissed her , then tore himself away . " I must run off at once and tell Cummings and Joseph . I 'm going ! "  | That particular day in September when Professor Whipple dropped in he had , as usual , been drinking and his smile mocked . " How fares the great American Scientific Expedition ? " Audubon , putting a packet of pastels on a pile , did not take offense . " It goes well . " " And this , I presume , " Whipple touched the chalks , the brushes , paints , pencils and rolls of paper , " constitutes the whole of the scientific equipment ? " " Oh , I 'm taking my dog also , " Audubon smiled . " Success is more in the brain and the will , my friend , than in costly gear . " Whipple made Lucy nervous . She feared some barb might thrust too far , might deflate . He said , " What really amuses me is not that this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have such vast objectives . " " Then prepare to laugh some more , for now I make them even vaster . After exploring the New Orleans Delta , I mean to go to the Florida Keys to find and draw the migrating birds . " Captain Cummings hurried in , calling , " Audubon ! A fine stroke of luck ! A chap I know , Jacob Aumanck , has been made captain of a fleet of three flatboats going downriver . He knows I 'm on to the river navigation and has asked me to go . I told him of our plans and what a good shot you were , and Joseph , too . He says we can go on one of his boats ! " Audubon looked astonished . " For nothing ? " " I 'm to navigate one boat and the three of us are to provide the crew with fresh game . " " Pay your way , " Whipple said , " or do n't go . What if you ca n't provide the game ? Then there 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cummings said . " Which we have n't got , " Audubon said . " And he 'll start in two or three weeks . " Audubon said , " A flatboat might serve us well . We 'll have chances to stop onshore . And now , Cummings , guess what I have ? A letter from my old acquaintance Henry Clay ! " " This is our lucky day . Read it ! " " It 's from Lexington , Kentucky , dated August 25th . He says :  | " I received yours of the 12th and transmit enclosed such a letter as I presume you want . Will it not be well for you before you commit yourself to any great expense in the preparation and publication of your contemplated work to ascertain the success which attended a similar undertaking of Mr. Wilson ? ... " " Yes , " Whipple said , " how about Wilson ? " Audubon ignored him . " I 'll read the letter Mr. Clay sent for my use . " I have had the satisfaction of a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others who have known him longer and better that his character and conduct have been uniformly good . Being about to take a journey through the Southwestern portion of our country with a laudable object connected with its natural history , I take pleasure in recommending him to the kind offices of agents of government and other citizens , as a gentleman of amiable and excellent qualities , well qualified to execute the object he undertakes . Signed , Henry Clay " Whipple 's laugh was cruel . " What I 'd like to see is the faces of the people you present the letter to  --  that is , if they prove to be anyone of consequence  --  when this great American Scientific Expedition of two men and a boy begins to look and smell like flatboat men . " Whipple , " Audubon said , " for once you 're right . If we do n't maintain a respectable appearance , we 'll defeat our purpose . " " Let 's agree up now to change our shirts once a week , no matter what , " Cummings said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governors of the states and territories we pass through , to ask their aid , " Audubon said . Whipple 's laugh whooped out . " The governors ! The next thing you 'll be writing to the President of the United States , asking him to help you . " Audubon smiled . " The President ? It 's an idea . "  | It was October 12 , 1820 . Lucy got out of bed , leaving the warmth of her busband 's arms reluctantly . Finally , inevitably , the day had come . By now , she had seven pupils . But , what if she lost some ? What if she became sick ? Or the boys did ? But she kept her shoulders erect and pretended to be calm . It was four in the afternoon when they untied the boats and prepared to depart . Joseph Mason was already aboard . He stood waving back at his father and mother . Cummings was in the bow , helping with gear . Audubon lingered on the wharf . He kissed the boys . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was looking into luminous troubled eyes . " It will be all right , dearest , " she said quickly . " Everything will go well . " " Ah , my Lucy , if I could tell thee how I feel . Life seems now to tear me in two . I would stay here with thee , be a roustabout , a clerk , anything . But something else says , Go . " " ' Board ! All aboard ! " came the cry . He held her tightly and kissed her on the lips . Then he ran up the plank . It was lifted and they were moving out into the river . She stood with her arms around Victor and Johnny as they waved . In October , dusk came early . Almost before the flatboat was in the middle of the river , Audubon 's figure was indistinguishable from any other . He could be any one of thousands of men floating down the river , seeking land , or money , or ease and comfort or some promised land . " Dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Victor said . " When will Papa come back ? " Johnny asked . " Oh , in six months . By spring . Surely by spring . "  | CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE LUCY PUT ON her bonnet and cloak and picked up her satchel of books . She had to leave for the other side of town to meet her pupils . She did not want to go . She went back into the bedroom . Victor 's eyes glittered feverishly up at her . She pulled the blanket over his shoulders . There were rumors of smallpox in Cincinnati . Her hand touched his hot dry forehead . " Victor , you must stay in bed while I 'm gone . " " And if I want a drink of water ? " " Johnny will help . " " Johnny ! " His scornful glance took in John playing in the snowy backyard . " Look at him ! Building a sled with those boards I brought for our firewood . " " He 's only eight . When he 's eleven , he 'll be responsible like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , Victor ? , " she sat down on the bed and took his hand . " Listen , dear ! When I made the arrangement to take the grocer Schultz 's daughters into the class for our food , he especially stipulated that only on days I taught them could I get provisions . But I 'll be back soon . " " It always takes you three or four hours when you go to General Adams ' house for the class . " He turned away , accusing , deserted . There was a knock . Before she could reach the door , Whipple came in with a familiar , " Hallo . " He had seemed unaware of the boys before Audubon left , but now he stopped by often , with a toy or a sweet , on his way to the college . " Something 's wrong , " he said . " I can tell by your face . " " I must go out and Victor 's sick . If only I could count on my neighbors , " she sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begs ; on  | the other , the crew off a barge . Johnny means to help but forgets . I wish I did n't have to go  --  but I do . " " You know I would do anything for you , " he looked at her intently . " I 'll stay . How these men amuse me who see eagles in the sky but never their own family 's needs . " " It 's only if something goes wrong , I ca n't manage . " " As you are finding out , the balance between men and women is not accidental . The man earns , the woman tends . " " If God had n't wanted people to keep making fresh patterns to meet individual differences , he 'd have made them all the same . " " But , to leave you ! The man 's a fool . " There was a tap on the door and Lucy opened it . The visitor was Mrs. Traubel , the stiff feather on her bonnet pointing skyward . After a suspicious glance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but declined to remove the toga-like cloak of otter skins draping her imposing facade . Lucy mentioned the cold weather , the smallpox rumors . But Mrs. Traubel seemed fascinated by the dust on the table rungs , by the torn curtain Johnny had pulled yesterday . Lucy wanted to cry out , Do n't you understand ? I ca n't do everything at once ! Mrs. Traubel cleared her throat . " If you will permit me , Mrs. Audubon , I have n't much time , and will come directly to the point . It has come to my ears that you , without so much as discussing it with me , have taken it upon yourself to include the two daughters of the grocer Schultz in the class . If you had come to me first  --  and after all , the whole thing was my idea  --  I could have told you it would not do at all . Now General Adams ' wife is an unpredictable woman , but the other four pupils were placed with you on my recommendation . If it 's to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " " It 's ? " Lucy swallowed a hard lump of pride , " a matter of meeting my bills . " " Oh ? " Mrs. Traubel turned and stared at Whipple in a curious way , then with narrowed eyes at Lucy . She rose . " I must go . I 'm late for a meeting of the Shakespeare Society . Good day . " She departed .  | Lucy sat down . Her knees felt queer . " If four pupils are lost ? ! I can barely manage to live now . I 've written my husband every week but nothing that would disturb him . But now , perhaps I must write him to return . " She remembered the time and sprang up . " I 'll be late . Thank you for staying . " Dusk had fallen by the time she hurried up to her own door again . Her glance told her Victor was no worse , and she hardly took time to thank Whipple before she burst out with her good news . " Boys ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I stopped at the postoffice as always , but this time , there they were ! " " Letters from Papa ! Read them ! " Victor cried . She hesitated . " Thank you again , Mr. Whipple . It was most kind of you to remain with Victor . " But her hint was wasted . He said , " You are n't going to make me go without hearing how the traveler fares ! " " Read , Mama , " John demanded . Johnny leaned against her as she sat on Victor 's bed , pulling the candle closer so she could read . The boys , intent , waited motionless . She opened the one postmarked earliest and read : " November four , near Shawneetown . My beloved wife : I have been drawing since dawn and finished the common crow for the collection . Now the sun rises , reflected through trees on the placid river like a column of lively fire . Frost , heavy on the decks , with the sun on it , is beautiful beyond expression . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am gazing now at the black chalk portrait I made of thee . It fills me anew with strength and the will to achieve our aim . But then I think of thee , standing alone with our sons on the wharf at Cincinnati . That I myself left home with no money , relying on my drawing talents to supply my necessaries , is nothing , but when I reflect that every bend in the river takes me farther away from thee , fear gathers involuntarily . Yet enthusiasm fills me . I will overcome every obstacle to reach our goal . First , I will make a hundred more drawings , the birds of this region and Louisiana . Then , when all are at  | perfection , we must strive to publish the whole collection . With God 's help , we shall accomplish this . Yesterday , soon after sunrise , we passed Henderson . From the flatboat , I could see the mill , read the lettering : Audubon &; Co . I looked on it perhaps for the last time and with thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the river . But then , something happened that , if I were superstitious , could be taken for a good sign . I caught sight of an eagle . Thou knowest how long I have sought Sir Eagle . I could not help think that Henderson and all it stood for is behind me ? the eagle ahead . Though I do not expect a mail opportunity for some time , I write now and will continue to . If we meet a steamer bound for Cincinnati , letters will be ready for thee . Goodnight , beloved . Kiss my sons . " The boys had a rapt look , as though in another world , but Whipple said , " He seems to be enjoying himself . But then , is n't it just the kind of frolic he takes to ? " She felt unwilling to read the others while Whipple was there , to have his tongue flick off their bright edges . She rose , put the letters in her pocket . " The other two must be saved for tomorrow . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . " Then , after they were both settled in bed , and Whipple had gone , she opened the next letter and read : My dearest friend , my beloved wife : There is hope mail will go off at Fort of Arkansas , but hopes are shy birds flying at a great distance , seldom reached by the best of guns . Nevertheless I begin this and will add to it from time to time . Day before yesterday , to supply game , Captain Cummings , Joseph and I went ashore with our guns . We walked across a bend forty miles . I watched for eagles constantly , saw none . We shot thirty partridges , 27 squirrels and a fine buck . Could my wishes be fulfilled , I would have had you all fed on that game . I found also an autumnal warbler , as Alexander Wilson called the young of the yellow rump warbler . I think he erred  | in presenting this as a new species . My drawing will show this . Worked at drawing all day . Felt poorly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand erect gives one a violent headache . Today went ashore early watching for eagles . Saw one , but at a distance . It had a white head and brown body . This corroborates Wilson 's idea of its being the same bird with the brown eagle . It was gone by the time we reached the spot . We landed at noon in this dreary place , in cold wind and rain . I can not draw as wind makes the cabin too smoky . I have tried playing on my flute , looking at my drawings , trying to read , but the day is long and heavy . As thou knowest , I am naturally of light spirits and try always to keep them good , but when away from my home and thee , I have often dull moments of anguish . I look at thy portrait now , and it seems altered and sorrowful . I am filled with dread of thy being in want , yet I can not hear from thee for weeks to come . I pray for thy health and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , forever , thine husband and friend . J. J. Audubon I have fifteen new drawings . The candle guttered down . Lucy lit a fresh one , and opened the third letter . She read : November 20 My dearest friend : I begin this not knowing when it will reach thee . Thy portrait looks at me . If only I could know all was well with thee . Now we have left the Ohio and are in the Mississippi . Yesterday we passed two eagles ' nests , eight feet in diameter , of large dead sticks , in not very high cypresses . One of these I remember seeing as I passed here going to New Orleans eighteen months ago with my slave George pursuing the trickster Sneaders from Henderson . Now , I pursue the eagle . Today , Joseph and I took the skiff and floated ahead of the flatboats . In the skiff we could be quieter and hoped we would have a better chance . I saw one , far ahead , my great bird .  | The light was such I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Around noon I saw several , but they still kept off . When I consider how long I have sought one , how determined I am never to draw from a stuffed specimen , yet how necessary one is to fill out my collection , it is natural I am restless and can not sleep . I must obtain one alive if possible . Nov. 25 . Weather bad today . We are anchored about two miles below a town called Memphis . The eagles retire in bad weather to the inner cypress woods . With the spyglass I saw several , chasing ducks . If they force a duck from the flock , he is undoubtedly carried to a sandbank and eaten by both eagles . They watch from tree-tops and dash at anything that comes near . To secure a goose , the male and female dive alternatively so the poor fellow is forced in a few minutes . I saw two of them regaling themselves on the carcass of a deer . The eagles are now courting . I can see them chasing off the bachelors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female , on a very high limb of a tree , squatted at approach of male , who came like a torrent , alighted on her and cackled shrill until he sailed off . This is proof the Falco genus breeds much earlier than any other land bird . Nov. 26 . I went ashore today . Had hard traveling through tangles of bulrushes , green briar and cane , but saw nothing until this evening when I shot a mallard . As Dash was bringing it out , suddenly a great white-headed eagle swooped for it . The bitch brought the mallard , but I did not get the eagle . Nov. 27 . I had a shot at an eagle today ! It was only a hundred fifty yards off and I missed . I can not well account for that . Nov. 28 . Today , shot a beautiful white-headed eagle , male . When Dash brought it , his wing was torn , and my ball had torn the body . My feelings were mixed as I gazed at the beautiful creature . I had hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flatboat and have begun my drawing . Dec. 1 . Finished the drawing . Have been working four days without ceasing , scarce stopping to eat . Violent headache and sore eyes . The noble bird weighs nine pounds and measured six feet with an extremely large heart . Today is Sunday .  | Joseph , Captain Cummings and I bathe and shave and change shirts as we agreed . To clean oneself in the river is one of the few pleasures a flatboat affords . There is no marking of the clay , but I like to look at thy portrait and to spend an hour in thinking of my family . Dec. 2 . Today , I had great good fortune ! This morning early , I took the skiff , lay down in the bow and floated ahead of the boat . A large white-headed eagle circled above me . I shot , he fell . The female came then , and hovered over , shrieking her sorrow for her mate . I had winged him and was able to capture him alive ! It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board , he looked on his enemies with a contemptible eye . I tied a string on his leg , and he jumped overboard at once , and my Lucy , even with a pole weighing fifteen pounds , swam off and almost made shore . He would have if I had not made after him in the skiff , and even then he defended himself . On board again , I fastened him , and while I was friendly Indian toward him , offering fish on a stick , his foot lanced my thumb . But , now I can see what his eye is really like ! Now I can see exactly how he ruffs neck feathers as I approach and he hisses at me . Lucy , my first drawing cost me four days of painful toil and struggle , but I will discard it . I will begin again . No matter how many days it takes , or how much struggle , I will make a drawing worthy of him . Dec. 4 . Worked all day yesterday and today on new drawing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald eagle and brown eagle are two different species . Dec. 6 . Finished my drawing of the eagle . Violent headache and sore eyes , but it will not disgrace him , or my collection , I think . Exhausted though I am , it did seem to me that , now that we know our goal , now that we have taken this stand , now that I no longer try to buy and sell , to carry on business where my heart is not  --  now that I may spend my whole force pushing toward our Book  --  because I work with a whole heart  --  it goes forward ! Tomorrow we may be able to send off mail . I pray for thy safety . Kiss my Kentucky lads . Good-night , beloved .  | Almost , he seemed in the room with her . She brought a fresh candle and read the letters again . Her eyes and spirit lingered , refreshing themselves as at an oasis , at certain phrases : " Now that we know our plan " ? or " Because I work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen now and wrote him . Before , she 'd written masked letters , trying , almost , not to communicate . But he had written , communicating completely , not sparing her the irritations and hardships of his life . Now , she could pour out her own stresses . What a release to share bad experiences , even to complain , to write that " Today , Mrs. Traubel may have lost me four pupils , " and " There may be a doctor 's bill for Victor , " but in the end to write , " There have been moments when I thought I must ask you to return , but it seems to me now that I will manage somehow . I 'm sure the eagle is ahead . " Victor recovered quickly , but Mrs. Traubel 's friends did withdraw . For the next month Lucy managed because the general 's daughters remained and the grocer Schultz kept to his barter arrangement . But then , the general left for a new post in the West , his family followed and almost at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughters . Lucy 's provisions were cut off . Every meal became an achievement . On this particular day , Lucy stood , in bonnet and cloak , ready to go out , stirring the pot . " Victor , I 've scraped what meat was left off the joint . We 'll boil it with the bone . You must tend it carefully . " With serious face , Victor took the spoon and stirred . " If tomorrow we add carrots for a stew , we may make another meal of it . " Johnny frowned into the pot . " From that ? " Lucy sighed . " If only Mr. Schultz had not been such a snob . " " What 's a snob ? " John asked . " Someone who at heart is afraid he amounts to little . Mr. Schultz was interested in his daughters ' association with the general 's family rather than their education . But I 've heard of a family in need of tutoring . I 'm going now to inquire . It 's too far for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk a little with me . " But she  | caught her breath as John rammed careless arms past the darned elbows of his jacket . The idea of having to replace clothing somet lines woke her , terrified , at night . " I 'll stop at the postoffice . Perhaps today we 'll hear from your papa . " His last letter had told them he 'd landed at Natchez , had met Nicholas Berthoud there unexpectedly , and that Nicholas , on a mercantile voyage , had taken him aboard his faster keel down to New Orleans . How he fared since they did not know . Lucy approached the house of her prospective pupils . The home was of solid gray stone ; white shutters framed starched curtains behind shining windows . In a garden , boxwood surrounded roses , bare now in the snow . The lady of the house came to a side door , a shawl over her shoulders , letting out her pug and a young child , well bundled , into the garden . Lucy went up to the door . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to think only of whether to have mutton or beef for the Sunday roast , to see one 's husband every day  --  and every night . " Yes , " the lawyer 's wife sat up rather straight in her round tufted chair on the Wilton carpet , holding in her lap the safe symbol of her office  --  a basket of mending , " the doctor told me about you . We do have two boys , ten and twelve , who are ready for tutoring , but ? " Lucy sensed disapproval and resentment . The woman looked at Lucy in a curious way . The look stirred in Lucy a faint memory . Lucy knew she ought to take a proud tone , ought to mention the general 's wife , who had found her teaching highly satisfactory . Far back in October , talking to Mrs. Traubel , Lucy had been bold and daring . Now , she was desperate . The woman said , " You have two children at home ? " Lucy nodded , " Yes . " " And you spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I can do to tend my house properly and look after my family ! " " My husband is  --  on a journey . " " Oh . Then , he is n't sick , or a  --  drunkard ? " " No . " Lucy drew in a deep breath and wished very much she did not need pupils so desperately . " He 's just talented . " In a strange  | flash she recognized the expression on the woman 's face now . It was the same as those of those men at Henderson , looking at her husband  --  resentment , but bafflement , too . " My husband is an orithnologist . " For the first time , and with pride , Lucy placed him , out loud , for the world . " Is that one of these new religious cults ? " " He 's a naturalist  --  and an artist . " " An artist . Oh ! " There was silence . " It seems such a very odd arrangement . To me , the family is a sacred institution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen and his communistic society ? " " Teaching is the only way I have to pay my bills ! " " Oh . " The woman picked up her darning gourd , her eyes narrowing as she took a stitch . " I believe I heard something about a Mr. Whipple . Does n't he help you ? " " Mr. Whipple ! " Lucy 's face flamed hotly . " He is a friend of my husband 's . " Now Lucy herself sat up stiffly , her hands in mended gloves in her lap . " I am well qualified to teach young children their letters , and to older ones , piano , French , English literature and history . I have had success in bringing on reluctant pupils . My name is Mrs. John James Audubon and , " she scribbled the address on a piece of paper , " I may be reached here if you wish to engage me . " She stood up and , holding her tall figure erectly , she seemed to tower over the plump woman sitting on the tufted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take any more of your time . " As she walked rapidly toward her own house , her face kept flushing . How dreadful . I will ask Whipple not to come . The early darkness of midwinter shut out the noisome street as she approached her own door . Inside , she wanted to collapse on someone 's shoulder , to burst into tears , to be comforted . But Victor said worriedly , " Johnny 's out . " " Not come back ? " Her heart gave a great lunge . The river ! Though forbidden , he often played there . Then she heard a wonderful sound  --  sobbing . She flew to the door . John , disheveled , came in , wiping a hand across his nose . One shoe was gone . " I stayed hunting it in the mud by the river . But it came dark .  | It 's gone , " he sobbed . Then he looked at her , terrified , knowing this was calamity . " Your shoe ! How can I ever ? ? " He sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A pair of shoes ! The moon ! They ate their watery soup . For once , John did not complain . Afterward , Lucy said , " We have n't a sweet , but I 'll read to you instead . Shall we go on with Midsummer Night 's Dream ? " They heard a step . John ran to open the door . " Mr. Whipple ! I hope he 's brought sweets ! " Victor had not been attached so easily . I le sat in silence . " I know it 's late , " Whipple was gay , " but you 'll be glad I 've come . I was in the White Horse Tavern when one of the crew off the steamer Comet came there to inquire for your house . I told him I 'd bring him here . He 's following . " A Negro came in then with a heavy crate . He put it on the floor . Whipple gave him a coin and he left . Oh , let it be food , Lucy prayed . Venison , hams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whipple handed her a letter . " This came , too . " He joined the boys in prying open the crate while she glanced at the first lines of the letter : My dearest wife : Having an opportunity to send by the steamer Comet a present .. . Whatever he had sent , it was packed in straw . The boys were pulling it out by handfuls. ... having a lucky week , drawing , on order , five chalk portraits .. . Victor 's hand plunged into the straw , came up with a cup . John pulled out a plate , another cup . " Dishes ! " Victor said . Lucy 's eyes went back to the letter : Thou mayest have thought I did not see thy tears at the loss of thy china in Henderson . This is only Queensware , but  | strong and new . Some day when we have published our book , may I buy thee a finer set ... . " Plates ! " Johnny cried . " I wish it had been something to put on them ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't cry . We could sell this in the market . It should bring enough to buy new boots for that miserable Johnny . " " Boots ? Johnny ? " Whipple asked . " I lost my shoe in the mud . " " Well , now , perhaps I could make you a present of a fine pair . " Lucy took in a quick breath . " Boys , I 'm sure it 's past your bedtime , indeed far past . " After she had them settled and returned , Whipple said , " You 're upset . Are n't you happy about your thoughtful , charming present ? " " I must ask you not to come here any more , Mr. Whipple . " He stood up . " Not come ? Why ? " " I 've never paid much attention to what people say , but by my naivete , I 'm placed in a false light . Things are being said about us which I 'm sure neither of us ever thought of . " He took a step toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . " He came closer . " And you surely know I have . " She stepped back , but he followed , " How can you think of him any longer ? " He was very close now . " He has left you . " With cold horror she felt his hand on her waist . She tried to push it away , but his arms pulled her roughly toward him . " You 're a warm , sweet woman . Why deny a woman 's feelings ? " She pushed back as hard as she could , but felt his mouth , the hard bristly whiskers of his mustache as he kissed her violently . Wildly , she pushed him back , managed to put the table between them . " Go . Go at once ! " " Do n't be foolish . You need me . " " Never come here again ! " " You ca n't prevent me . Johnny will always unbar the door . " " Go ! Please ! Please ! "  | " You 're distrait now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tomorrow . I 'll be back . " After he had gone , she stood a long time , her heart pumping wildly . The candle guttered out . She moved then and lit another . She took her husband 's letter out of her pocket and finished reading it . I at present live on a keel boat , tied up , with hundreds of others , in a squalid section of New Orleans . I go about seeking work in the painting line . A poor fellow I met in a tavern where I went to seek work drawing portraits had no shoes . I took him to a cobbler 's , and offered to draw the shoemaker 's portrait for a pair . The bargain was made , I drew the chalk portrait , and the poor man went on his way happily with his new boots ... . She could read no more , but dropped the letter , crying out in exasperated frustration . They seemed completely out of communication with each other . Anger flooded her cheeks . But she knew he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat a long time , motionless . She thought of Whipple , could feel again the hard bristly mustache . She was afraid . After a while , the blew out the candle and went to her cold bed . When she fell asleep it was to dream of a house with white illars on a hill above a stream , of a storeroom , its door open . inside , she could see hams , sides of beef , racks of mutton , bags of flour , flitches of bacon , barrels of apples , sacks of potatoes , and strings of vegetables drying . Then she seemed to he going up a wide staircase with a mahogany rail . She came to the sewing-room . Inside , she could see , on shelves and tables , bolts of cloth , fine linen , wool , muslins . But suddenly , someone stood in the door , barring her way . It was Miss Smith . " I told you it was a mistake . But you would marry him . " She woke up . She could not fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire and sat thinking . Finally , she reached a decision . She went back to bed then , but very early in the morning , she rose , and dressed quietly so as not to waken the boys .  | She went to the largest one of her husband 's portfolios . She untied it and looked in . Her hand reached out , and she stared at it in horror of what it was about to do . But , she thought , he has said it is our work , our collection . I must . It will enable him to go on . Her breath came fast , but she lifted out the top drawing , rolled it up , put it under her cloak and went out , closing the door softly . Hours later , when she returned with parcels , the boys waited for her anxiously . " Where 've you been ? " " Here ! Open it , John . " " New boots ! " " And I 've brought a loaf and milk for breakfast . I 've arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the secondhand shop to send a cart for the furniture . We 're going to leave Cincinnati ! " Victor 's mouth hung open . " Soon ? " " Today . There is a barge leaving . With  --  what I sold  --  we can pay the passage . " " Are we running away from someone ? " Victor had never been taken in by Whipple . Perhaps now he guessed . " It 's  --  best to go , " she said . " Are we going to find Papa ? " John asked . " No . To my sister , your aunt Eliza Berthoud , in Shippingport . There , we 'll not be so  --  unprotected . " John frowned . " But Papa said to stay here till he came back . We might get lost from each other . " " He 'll find us . We 'll write him . " " Why do we have to go today ? " Lucy remembered insistent hands clutching her waist , a rude hot mouth . " I think it prudent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son on either arm , went out the door , down the mean street . She did not look back at the crooked , ugly little house .  | CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX EVEN THE LIGHT chitter of her female relatives , the swoop of their skirts as they bent over their children at the tea table , gave Lucy a sense of being safe . Lucy 's sister Eliza , Nicholas Berthoud 's wife , said , " Mary , you 've spilled jam on your pinny . What will your papa think when he comes , and after not seeing you all these months ? Nana , change er quickly . " Madame Berthoud , Eliza 's mother-in-law , lifted the curtain to er again toward the river . " I ca n't help it . I know it 's scarce an our since the steamer brought us word Nicholas was coming . " Nicholas ' relatives , not only his father and mother , but his in-laws , e Bakewells , had gathered to welcome him home from his keel . at trip to New Orleans . Now Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children  --  Eliza 's two , the two of Lucy 's brother Thomas , and Lucy 's own Victor and John . " It was clever of you , Eliza , not to make the children wait until my son comes . " " Children hungry are children cross and naughty , " Eliza said . Pregnant now with her third child , her movements were awkward . Lucy looked at her own sons . Three months ago , when they had first come here to Eliza 's pleasant comfortable house , they kept on eating even after they were filled because the food was there . Now they were no greedier than the other children . But Lucy herself felt that never again could she look at a table such as this without being conscious of the wonder of a full fat loaf , golden crust sliced and crimped , the marvel of golden butter on an ample silver dish , the jewels of damson jelly . And she still liked to look at her relatives , to count them .  | Out on the lawn her brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steam engines in Louisville , was gesturing at her younger brother William , only nine when she left Fatland , now a handsome young man come to learn the western mercantile trade in Nicholas ' counting-room . Eliza 's father-in-law , the elder Berthoud , turned to come in and the others followed him . " Wind 's right for sail , " Thomas said . " Nicholas will be here any minute , you 'll see . " Thomas is always selling something , Lucy thought . The elder Berthoud 's eyes widened slightly at the abundant high tea at this hour , but he turned away , accepting with urbanity the customs , no matter how barbaric , of his earnest English in-laws . The children finished and with a whoop , flowed out the window to the lawn . The servant began to clear and arrange a second sitting for the adults . Lucy saw Eliza look at Thomas in an odd way , then he cleared his throat . " This is as good a time as any , Lucy , to discuss with you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not appalled by the sight of our sister Lucy and her children , arriving from Cincinnati , half-frozen , half-starved ? " " Not so bad as that ! " Lucy broke in . " And to see her , now , trying to support her children and herself , while her husband wanders off , shunting his duties onto her shoulders ! I , for one , believe we should write him a strong letter . " " No ! You must not ! It would be cruel ! " Eliza broke out , " And is n't it cruel , your having to live so ? I declare , Lucy , I can hardly bear to see you struggling so ! " " And yet , " Madame Berthoud said , " in such an affair is n't it always dangerous to have interference by outsiders ? " " Outsiders ! " Eliza cried , " I 'm her sister ! " Mr. Berthoud put in , " But , if Lucy herself does not object . " " All of us  --  my husband , my children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trying to get his work published . " Eliza shook her head sorrowfully . " Lucy , this is such a grandiose notion of his , and so extremely far from ever being carried out . " " I do n't agree ! " Lucy flashed out .  | " I did n't want to before , but let me read you something from a letter Nicholas wrote me from New Orleans . " She hurried to her secretary , produced a letter , and read : " It distresses me to see a man of such sensibility and talent running about the levee , asking in low ale houses , trying to pick up a few dollars from making chalk portraits to buy food . He still lives on my keel boat , and is shabby from his river voyage , but I do not like to offend him by offering clothing . I introduce him to my friends , hoping he may get orders for portraits . He hangs about the market , buying birds hunters bring in , draws them and manages to live somehow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you wear yourself into an early grave , sacrificing for some overblown scheme he obviously is not accomplishing . " " He will accomplish it , " Lucy said . " You are blind , Lucy , " Eliza shook her head . Suddenly the children gave a great shout . The adults rushed to the window . Nicholas , his traveling cape blowing out behind him in the wind from the river , was striding across the lawn . The Negroes who had accompanied him south followed with portanteaus , and boxes of trade goods . Now the children engulfed I. im . His wife and parents ran out , and escorted Nicholas inside . The room was bright with waves of talk and laughter . By the time the fine tea was consumed , and Eliza 's pregnancy discussed , Mary 's easles , the boys ' colds , Madame 's rheumatism , the state of business  --  Lucy felt it fair to ask , " And my husband ? " " He had to leave the keel , of course , when we came north , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low part of town , I 'm afraid . He commissioned me to bring something to you . " Nicholas went toward the hall , spoke to one of the Negroes , piling baggage from the boat . Then Nicholas returned , a Negro following him , carrying two heavy burlap-wrapped articles . " Unwrap them , Cicero . " The layers of dusty burlap came off . Lucy almost cried out .  | There were two of his great shabby portfolios . For a moment , it seemed Audubon himself was in the room . She ran to them , knelt on the floor , untied one and lifted back the cover . She was staring at the bold sure drawing of the bald eagle . Out of the squalid , hand-to-mouth life on the flatboat  --  this had come . She lifted another drawing . The portfolio was crammed full . She looked up . She could see the sober faces of her relatives , waiting to pronounce judgment . " Ca n't you understand ? " Lucy cried . " All these drawings , oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every nerve . But , ca n't you see , we 're on our way toward our goal ! " Eliza shook her head . " Oh , Lucy , how can these lines drawn on paper make up for your struggle , your insecurity ? For the boys not having their father with them ? It 's not worth it ! " " His wife and sons are not forgotten , I assure you , " Nicholas said . Lucy stood up now . " He must be allowed time . " " He 's had twelve years , " Eliza said . " Twelve  --  or fifteen years ! What 's inside him must be allowed to come out . It must , I tell you ! " That night , before she went to bed , Lucy opened the portfolios which had been carried into her room , and looked at all the drawings , one by one , thinking of his finding each bird , the strained tense hours that had gone into each exact , sparkling drawing . Eliza came then , in her peignoir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from love for you . You know that . " " I know , dear Eliza . " " It just seems to me , Lucy , you 're starved for more than just food . I 'd want my husband with me . " " Eliza , I can not make him over . Would I , even if I could ? I 've learned to accept him , and having learned that , I get real joy in his difference . I marvel and wonder and find happiness in helping it flower . These drawings  --  why , it 's almost as good as having him here . " But when Eliza had kissed her and was gone , Lucy touched the drawings he had touched . It was not the same as touching his hand .  | Lucy burned with ambition . She caught sight of her reflection in a store window , hurrying along a street in Louisville to give lessons : her good India shawl , slightly frayed now , a cast-off bonnet of Eliza 's and a skirt of Madame 's , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , she smiled , thinking , Who would think I am as ambitious as Napoleon ? First , of course , was the great goal  --  to have The Birds published . But lately , she had another  --  to send Victor and John to school ! Finally there came an evening , sitting with her sons , putting down figures in her worn little account-book , she could exult , " At last ! We 've saved enough for the school ! I 've been enquiring and Mr. Peabody 's is best . We 'll enroll you there . How pleased your papa will be when he comes home to find his boys in a good school ! " Now , if only she could manage to earn enough to rent a small house . She found it pleasant indeed to live in a conventional , wellrun household like Eliza 's , where the husband went off to his counting-room in the morning and where the gravest crisis was a naughty child . But her ambition burned to give her own family a house of its own . Audubon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one difficulty of a family 's trying to act together while apart was the uncertainty of communication . She had not had a letter from him for a long time . But then , one often heard of steamers blowing up , with all mail lost . Or  --  he might even be on his way north this minute ! When a letter did come from him finally , it was rather puzzling . She read : I have just returned from Bayou Sara where I wrote you I had taken a position on the Plantation Oakley ... . This was the first Lucy had heard of it . Tutoring a young girl in drawing , French and music was not exactly how I had planned to spend my life , but the salary was sixty dollars a month , and as I had stipulated Joseph Mason was to come with me and half our time was to be allowed for our own pursuits , and the dense magnolia woods turned out  | to be marvelous for birds , the time was not lost in working toward our goal . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to find no mail from thee was a sad disappointment . Since I left Cincinnati a year ago , I have finished sixty-two drawings of birds and plants , and , of course , many portraits of all sorts , which earned my living . I send thee a draft , on Mr. Gorden here , of all the money I can spare , $270 . After sending the draft , I have still forty-two dollars . But what is more important , I have health and as great anxiety to pursue our plan as ever I had , and hope God will grant us the power to proceed . When I have my Lucy and my sons with me , no obstacle will seem too great . The amount of draft should pay passage on the steamer here for thyself and the lads . I await thy coming with much love , Thy friend and husband Lucy felt consternation at the letter . What was he expecting of her ? Eliza , after hearing of it , said , " Lucy , I 'm the first to admit your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but  --  we have often remarked it  --  he does sometimes not show much common sense ! From this , one might judge he actually wants you to go there ! Now , after you 've made such an effort to get established here and when the little boys are in school for the first time in their lives ! And why ? So that he may have company for a few months while he finishes this famous collection ! " Lucy said , " If he actually wants me to go there , I think his judgment 's wrong . It would seem much more sensible to use the $270 to rent a little house of our own . You know how I feel about that . Then when he comes , we 'll all be happy here . " The more she thought about it , the surer she was this was one time when she must exercise her newly realized responsibility for decision . It seemed so sensible to settle the family that when she heard of a suitable house to rent , she decided to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piano lesson at a large house where ten years ago or more , when she had first come  | here to Louisville as a bride , she had been entertained many times . With a smile she recalled how the hazily bright air had seemed filled with the sound of dancing feet and the tinkle of harpsichords . Now , it was the laborious bump-bump of a pupil 's clumsy fingers in a piano exercise . She hurried along , past the Tavern of the Indian Queen , where Victor had been born , toward a part of the town unfamiliar to her , hesitating in a street where cottages , unpretentious but respectable , pressed close together . She knocked at a door to inquire . A large broad-shouldered woman with a weathered face opened the door . " I beg your pardon for disturbing you , " Lucy said , " but could you direct me to a house owned by a Mr. Spring ? I am to view it for renting . " The woman pointed . Then she said , " You look like someone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " N'omi ! N'omi Keefer ! " Her rough hand grasped Lucy 's , and pulled her inside . Sun poured over plants in the window , on furnishings scuffed and shabby . N'omi beamed . " It 's been twelve years ! You lived here all this while ? " " Oh , no ! Have you ? " " No , we had a wagon-shop back country , but got burned out . We come here then to be near our sons . I got ten grandchildren ! I often thought about you and your husband . And now you 're lookin ' for a house to rent here ? " " Yes . I 've been staying with my sister in Shippingport , with my two sons . But she has a new baby and two of her own , and we crowd her . Besides , I earn our living teaching , and have pupils here in Louisville , and it will be nearer . " " Your husband 's dead ? " " No . He 's off on a journey . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd like to know what that was but was too polite to pry . " And you go about , earning money ? Well , I declare ! It 's a new way .
