DDAY PART THREE By DAVID HOWARTH The American Air Drop nifty miles to the west of the scene of the British air drop , in the Cherbourg peninsula , the German 709th Infantry Division was scattered in farms and villages along thirty miles of the channel coast . Some of its men were Poles and Russians who had fought for Russia and been captured and agreed to fight for Germany  --  men rated officially as unreliable . In fact , the 709th Division was a third-rate unit , fit only to man the static defenses of the Atlantic Wall . The whole division knew that invasion was coming sometime , but none of the men suspected , on the night of June 5 , 1944. that their doom was already approaching . About midnight an air-raid warning was sounded in their district . That was nothing unusual , but the men had to turn out for air-raid posts . Among those alerted was a German named Erwin Muller , stationed on a farm southeast of the town of Montebourg . Muller 's wife was Danish , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply for Danish citizenship . After Germany invaded Denmark , he was drafted into the German Army . He went quietly , for fear of getting his wife and children and his parents in Germany into trouble . He did not want to fight for Germany . There was Jewish blood in his family , and under the Nazis his father , still living in Germany , had led a precarious life . Soon after midnight , Muller 's platoon was ordered to march to a village called Azeville . They marched with blanks in their rifles , believing this was another exercise . Disillusion- 29 ment came on the outskirts of Azeville , where they were shot at from the churchyard . The whole platoon dropped into ditches and reloaded their guns with live rounds . The firing died away ; a man was found dead by the church porch . Muller , looking down at him , recognized the equipment of an American parachutist and knew the day had come . Soon afterward , Muller saw the whole night sky to the south and west filled with parachutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect our west flank ( indicated area on map .11 lel t I he detail ) d ) .411 ( , 11,0 ) , I be drop .1 , me the lighling resembled I ndianwarial ) the village and the fight was resumed . By dawn the village seemed to be surrounded . MUller 's platoon had no radio . The platoon commander told the sergeant to try to gel a patrol through to brigade headquarters and ask for orders . The sergeant picked Mtiller and a couple of younger men . Soon after dawn they stole out of the village . As they crept along beside a hedge they saw two American soldiers in a meadow . One of the parachutists had a pinup girl painted on the back of his jacket , and the other had the words SEE You IN PARIS on the back of his . Willer , who could speak English , poked his rifle through the hedge and said , " Hullo . " The Americans wheeled round . " Hands up , " Muller said . He and the sergeant broke through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sorry , but we must search you , " Muller said . " O.K. , if you say so , " the younger of the two Americans answered . " But do n't take the picture of my girl . " " I take nothing but your weapons , " Willer said . The collection of stuff which he found in their pockets included chocolate , silk stockings and elegant lingerie . " What 's this for ? " he demanded . " That 's for the little girls in Paris , " the prisoner said . " And the candy 's for me . Have some ? Say , how far is it to Paris , fella ? " " I do n't know , I 've never been there , " Midler said and accepted the chocolate . " Do n't eat it , " one of the young Germans shouted , " it might be poisoned ! " " What does he say ? ' ' the American asked . Muller told him . The American laughed . " It 's not poisoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muller felt a bond of understanding with this self-confident young man . He ate the chocolate and turned his attention to the man who was lying wounded . He was badly hurt , and it was only a minute or two before he died . The young American knelt beside the dead man and closed his eyes and crossed his arms on his chest . Then he began to say the Lord 's Prayer . M'Uller and the other American joined in. - The sergeant and the two young German soldiers , recognizing the rhythm of the words , took up the prayer in German , and the six men in their two languages prayed together , grouped around the man who had died . Willer and his sergeant got their prisoners back to the village in the end and handed them over to their platoon com mander . Willer himself was taken prisoner after a week of wandering , and so , long after D Day , he returned to his wife alive . Suspended from one of the multitude of parachutes which Midler had seen descending was a farm boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the ground came up to him he got ready for the bump . It was not a bump , it was a splash . Expecting the solid earth , he fell into three feet of water . It closed over his head , and in panic  --  thinking the water was deeper  --  he lashed out with his arms and legs and came floundering to the surface . Before he found his balance he went under again , weighed down by seventy pounds of equipment . Blue was lucky not to drown , as so many Americans and British drowned that morning . He was trembling from shock when he got clear of his harness and stood up , waist deep in the stinking , soupy water . He peered around at the menacing countryside , feeling desperately lonely . And then he heard angry American curses . " Hi , there ! " Blue shouted . " Is that you , Blue ? " It was the voice of a buddy . " I 've lost my damn helmet . " The journey from the North Carolina farm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had taken two years . He had volunteered as a parachutist because Gen. William C. Lee , the outstanding pioneer of American air-borne forces , had been a near neighbor of his family in the town of Dunn , North Carolina , The general had hem the hero of his boyhood , and he still was . Army life suited Blue . He had been brought up to hard work , and he was an amiable , kindhearted , friendly young man who nevertheless enjoyed a good fight from time to time . His three months in England had been a riot of new experience and excitement . He had won in fights and won at cards and won in love , too , and he went to Normandy expecting still to carry all before him . As soon as Blue heard his friend 's voice , his moment of panic ended . The two men waded toward each other . Tracer bullets were flying to the westward , but with rifles full of water neither man was in any condition to fight . So they waded away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blue regretted this afterward when he heard that the fight just behind them had been led by Brig . Gen. James M. Gavin , the assistant commander of the 82nd Airborne Division , a man whom Blue admired next only to General Lee . General Gavin . who at that moment was leading only a few dozen riflemen , was the kind of young , intelligent officer to whom the American Army often entrusts high command . He had jumped with the 82nd Division in Sicily and worked as an air-borne adviser on plans for the Normandy invasion . This must have been a frustrating task , because the plans had often been changed , A final change was caused by the Germans . For a long time two divisions of Germans had garrisoned the countryside of the Cherbourg peninsula . One was Erwin Miller 's and the other was also a static division of inferior quality . Then , during May , French railwaymen reported through their underground that a new and better division was moving into the district of Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte . This was the area where the 82nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition , the 82nd might easily have been cut off and tied down in self-defense . So a new plan was devised on May twenty-seventh : to drop both air-borne divisions close to Utah Beach . The ultimate last-minute plan , like the British plan , was based upon rivers , floods and bridges . Behind the sand dunes on the coast the Germans had flooded a long strip of low-lying meadows . roughly a mile wide . These were crossed by half a dozen causeways which had to be captured to get sea-borne forces off the beach . To the south , about seven miles inland , the Germans had also flooded the valley of the Douve River . The gap between the two belts of floods was pastureland typical of Normandy , a maze of tiny fields and thick hedges . Here the majority of the parachutists were to drop . The 101st Airborne Division was to capture the inland ends of the causeways which led from Utah Beach , capture or destroy the bridges and a lock on the Douve River  --  and so protect the southward flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north . The 82nd Division was to drop on both sides of the Merderet River , a small tributary of the Douve . It was to capture the town of Sainte-Mere-Eglise and so cut the main road and railway from Carentan to Cherbourg , capture two bridges across the Merderet , and seize a wide area beyond it which sea-borne forces could use in a westward drive to cut the Cherbourg peninsula . It was this latter force of paratroops which General Gavin led across the channel . Two minutes before he jumped , Gavin had to adjust his mind to another sudden change in plans . Crossing the channel , he had glanced back in the moonlight and seen twenty aircraft flying in formation with his own , and beyond them , as far as the eye could reach , the stream of other formations which carried his 7000 men . All was well . But suddenly the view was blotted out . One minute beyond the coast the aircraft flew into thick clouds . Gavin thought of the chances of dropping blind , but before he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear again . Below the plane he saw with surprise a wide , gleaming sheet of water . By its size he thought it could only be the flooded valley of the Douve , but it seemed to run from north to south , instead of east to west . He looked astern and saw something worse . The tight formation of planes had disappeared . Two stragglers came out of the cloud bank , and that was all . At that crucial moment he did not know where he was or what had become of his troops . The green light flashed . Fra ? three moreseconds he searched the ground for a landmark , and seeing none , he jumped . He landed in an orchard full of cows and looked up at a sky which should have been full of parachutes . It was empty . There was nobody to be seen on the ground . He walked eastward to round up the twenty men who had dropped from his plane . The search brought him to the edge of the water he had seen before he jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer to investigate a flashing tight on the far side of the flood . The officer came back to report that he had waded for an hour , sometimes up to his neck , and had found a railway embankment . The only railway embankment in the district was in the Merderet valley just north of SainteMere-Eglise . The water must be the Merderet ; yet the Merderet had appeared on aerial photographs as a narrow brook . Gavin was surprised that the ample floods spread before him had never been spotted by air reconnaissance , and this is still one of the minor mysteries of the invasion . The explanation seemed to be that grass and weeds had grown up through the water and lay in a mat on the surface , so that most of the valley looked solid . Whatever the explanation , the important fact was that most of the regiment which should have dropped with Gavin had overshot and fallen , with its equipment , into the water . During the night 150 men from different units attached themselves to Gavin . Many were soaking wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in skirmishes with a German patrol . No man had a weapon heavier than a rifle . Gavin placed some along the hedges for defense and set others to search the floodwaters for equipment  --  especially for any weapon which could be used against a tank . The German patrol closed in and began to attack . For the moment the general was acting as a company commander , Blue and his friend staggered through the marsh , found the railway embankment and dragged themselves up its side , water pouring out of their pockets . On top they found a dozen men commanded by a lieutenant . Blue had never seen any of them before . At dawn he followed them southward , stumbling across railway ties until they came to dry land and a bridge where the railway was crossed by a lane . This was the road from SainteMere-Eglise to the river bridge at the hamlet of La Fiere ; the capture of this bridge was one of the division 's aims . A good many other men had gathered near the road . The lieutenant handed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , a party began to advance toward the bridge . Blue went with them . They had one bazooka and one machinegun . Near the bridge the party was shot at from a group of farm buildings , and a sharp fight developed . They fired at the windows with rifles and the machine gun . Soon a white flag appeared , but when a paratroop lieutenant pushed open the door of the farmhouse , he was shot in the ear . He angrily called for the bazooka , Two rounds were fired through the downstairs windows . They exploded inside and set the house on fire . In a minute or two a German officer and fifteen men came out with their hands up . Blue was so elated with this quick and easy victory that he believed the war was as good as over . But then his high spirits were dashed . Two elderly Frenchmen hobbled out from the back of the burning house , one of them pushing a wheelbarrow ; and in the wheelbarrow was a very old woman . She looked , Blue thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He suddenly pictured this happening in a farmhouse at home , and for a moment it made him ashamed . Should n't somebody tell the old people they were sorry ? instead , the order came to cross the bridge . Quite a force of parachutists walked unmolested over the bridge and a causeway 400 yards long which crossed the marsh beyond . Most of them spread out and vanished on the other side , and Blue was left with three or four officers and half a dozen men to look after the bridge . The position did not worry him  --  like any good private , he expected somebody else to do the worrying . He sat in what little sun there was to get dry . An armored counterattack caught them with overwhelming strength . Blue saw the German tanks come down the lane , but then his awareness of what was happening shrank to a confused impression of hellish noise and violence and a feeling of utter frustration as he pressed himself . into the grass by the side of the lane . He had no weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did some damage , but not enough , and Blue heard an officer shout , " Every man on his own r He ran toward the marsh and plunged in , keeping his head down among tall reeds while tanks came roaring along the causeway close behind him . He reached the abutment of the bridge and lay on the steep slope while some of the water drained out of his clothes . Somebody shouted , " Run , soldier ! " and he got up and ran like a snipe across the bridge , bullets whipping past him , and fell down gasping on the other side , back where he had started an hour before . The farmhouse was still burning . The three old French people had gone , but Blue never forgot them , any more than he forgot his first victory or his first defeat . Just about the time when the bridge was lost , General Gavin arrived with his 150 men and began to sort out the situation . Gavin had already fought a long defensive action while half of his men searched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been found . Impatient to reach the bridge , Gavin decided to cross the flood and march down the railway , but his men were too late to save the bridge . The loss of the bridge split Gavin 's division in two , leaving parts of two regiments to fight without hope of reinforcements on the other side of the river valley . The bridge had been lost through a misunderstanding . The main body of troops who had crossed it were men who had dropped on the wrong side of the river and crossed over simply to get to the other side , where they belonged . They thought others were following behind them to defend the bridge , but nobody came except the dozen with Blue . Gavin set himself to try to force a second crossing , but without the support of heavy weapons the parachutists could not dislodge the Germans . Although they could not take the bridge , they did stop the Germans from crossing it and so held the German tanks away from the invasion beach and away from the town of Sainte-Mere-Eglise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early morning of D Day , another of Gavin 's regiments won an unqualified victory . Sainte-M  --  re-tglise is a little market town of gray stone houses which stand on each side of the main road from Cherbourg to the south . For four years an enormous Swastika flag had flown outside the town hall . Sainte-Mere-Eglise remembered the early days in 1940 , when the German Army , proud and confident , had marched up the road singing " If7r fahren gegen England , " promising that Britain in three weeks would be kaput . ( The town 's small boys soon perfected a technique of making seasick and drowning noises which ruined displays of military pomp . ) The delicate task of representing SainteMere-Eglise in its relations with the Germans had fallen upon the mayor , Alexandre Renaud , who was also proprietor of the town pharmacy . The local infantry commander was a swashbuckler who once threatened the mayor with execution . Renaud was not sorry when the battalion moved away . Then only an antiaircraft unit was left in the town , commanded by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been the music critic of a newspaper in Vienna . The night of the landing began with a house on fire on the square . M. Renaud had just gone to bed , uneasy in his mind , for he had spent the evening watching the flashes and flares of a tremendous air raid off toward the coast . He was roused by somebody banging on his front door  --  the tire brigade wanted men to carry water . He dressed quickly and crossed the square . The house was blazing , and the flames lighted up the bell tower of the church , where German machine gunners were shooting aimlessly at occasional aircraft passing overhead . Then the church bell rang and rang  --  the ancient signal of alarm . M. Renaud looked up and saw what was coming : low over the rooftops and the trees , a host of aircraft sweeping across the town , their wings black against the moon ; and then the giant confetti which drifted in their wake . M. Renaud and the firemen stood amazed . High up , the parachutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell , machine gunners on the church tower and in the square lowered their guns . The watchers , horrified , saw the convulsion of a man who was shot as he was falling . They saw a man fall into the fire and crash through the burning roof . Sparks spurted out , and the flames blazed up afresh . More squadrons of planes were passing over ; the bell was still ringing ; shots were cracking through the square . M. Renaud , anxious for his wife and children , hurried home . A German beneath the trees , pointing at the body of a parachutist , shouted to him with satisfaction . " Tommies  --  all kaput ! " This fatuous optimism may have been shared by other Germans in the square of Sainte-M  --  re-Eglise , for the few parachutists who had the bad luck to drop within the firelight were easy targets . But these men were stragglers from a whole regiment which landed between the town and the river in the most accurate drop of any parachute unit that night . About 1000 of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in before daylight . Within an hour the regi ment had begun to clear Sainte-MereEglise and block the road to the north and south . M. Renaud spent most of the night indoors , trying to interpret the sounds from the streets . Eventually he heard cars and motorcycles in the square and guessed that the antiaircraft battery was retreating . At daybreak he saw that his square was occupied by American troops . So Saintc-Mere-Eglise received the honor of being the first town in France which was liberated , an honor which it proudly remembers still , especially at its annual fete on the sixth of June . But the price had still to be paid . During the next two days the Germans shelled the town heavily . Many of M. Renaud 's townspeople were killed in the first two days of the freedom for which they had hoped so long . The capture of the town was the only specific objective the American air-borne troops achieved before dawn . But quick tactical victories were not the only way to success . During the night , far out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ficre , away in the dark woods and meadows , there began a gigantic and lethal game of hide-and-seek , More than 10,000 Americans were taking part in it and probably at least 5000 Germans . Grim , isolated games were being fought all over an area ten miles square . The Americans knew what was happening , but few of them knew where they were ; the Germans knew where they were , but none of them knew what was happening . At first almost every parachutist was alone , lost in the dark in strange country . Gen. Maxwell Taylor , commander of the 101st Division , spent his first half hour on the battlefield all alone , searching for even a single one of his 7000 men . When at last he did find an equally lonely trooper , they were so relieved that they embraced warmly . The Germans who were out that night , alone or in small patrol groups , had the same need for reassurance . They tried to find other Germans and band together for self-defense . All through the four hours from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little groups and solitary men , American and German , were prowling nervously about the country . Anything which moved or made a noise was liable to be shot at . The cows and horses suffered considerably . No German who ventured out by car or motorcycle succeeded in traveling far ; even a German general was ambushed and killed that night . This curious kind of Indian warfare had never been planned , but for about eight hours it totally paralyzed the Germans . Their garrisons were in small units , connected only by telephone and dispatch riders . The parachutists cut telephone wires whenever they saw them , and dispatch riders , of course , were sitting ducks . When their telephones went dead and their dispatch riders vanished , the German small-unit commanders did not know what to do and were scared to move . The German divisions were more heavily armed than the Americans , but their artillery and tanks , in these early hours , were useless . Ten thousand Americans spread over 100 square miles of country , constantly moving , never offered a target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Schuyler Jackson , who hailed from Washington , D.C. Jackson was playing his part with some relish in the one-man battles which were disrupting the German system of defense . Already he and one other man had come across a German antiaircraft gun whose crew of six were intent on targets overhead , It March : 2M , imro had been easy to creep up to them in the dark and throw grenades among them and kill 11114N11 all , With that success behind him , Jackson was ready to try his hand again . All the son : , he was worried because he could not hind out where he was or get on with his proper job . The 101st Division was to capture the inland ends of the causeways which led through the floods behind Utah Beach . His own battalion was to attack a heavy batterywhichcommanded thebeach from a village called **25;1540;TOOLONG . But now he had dropped , and Saint-Martin could not be found . Jackson kept meeting men from his own battalion , all going in different directions , and all as lost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been neatly dropped together in the wrong place . The leading aircraft had spotted pathfinders ' lights on another dropping zone , three miles south of where it should have been , and dropped its passengers there . Twenty-seven other aircraft had blindly followed its example . The battalion was not only lost ; it was leaderless . Its commander , Lt. Col. Steve A. Chappuis , was in one of the very few aircraft which found the right dropping zone . Colonel Chappuis could find only a dozen of his men . With that forlorn force he hurried to the battery to see what he could do  --  and found it ruined by recent air attacks and deserted . Corporal Jackson joined up with a friend , and soon they saw another man lying in a field . It was the colonel of their own regiment . He had broken his leg in the drop and had lain where he was for five hours . He told Jackson and his friend to drag him into cover at the side of the field . They had hardly started when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German running behind a hedge . The two men dropped i he colonel and gave chase . Jackson sprayed the hedges with his submachine gun . To his astonishment , screams and groans broke out , and a white handkerchief was poked through the upper branches . " Kamerat ! Kainerad ! " Jackson shouted . He hoped that would do as an order to surrender . It did . A dozen men came from behind the hedge , some with their hands up , some staggering . Jackson was shocked to see the result of his casual finger on the trigger . There were men drenched with blood . There was a hoy , who looked fifteen , shot through both wrists ; when he tried to put his hands up they hung limp , Other parachutists who had heard his fusillade were coming along the track . Jackson , half ashamed of the hot gun in his hand , let them take the prisoners . He went back to the colonel , who had a compound fracture and needed treatment . Jackson found someone who told him they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been designated divisional headquarters , and the colonel told Jackson to take him there . Jackson found a wheelbarrow in a farmyard , hoisted the colonel aboard and trundled him off down the lanes . " It must have hurt him like hell , " he said later . " But I 'll say he could still bark out his orders . " It was about 2:30 in the morning when General Taylor found the first man of his division . By 2:30 in the afternoon he was still out of touch with most of his command . But during the morning he had witnessed the attack on the first of the causeways which led to Utah Beach . The general had landed west of the village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and four miles southeast of Sainte- Mere-Eglise . He worked his way toward the coast , picking up an assortment of troops as he went . When dawn broke and the bombing and shelling of the coast began to shake the earth , about eighty men were with him in the meadows . Among them were General McAuliffe , his artillery commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct tower of the church of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont , and knew they were about two miles from the end of the southernmost causeway . ? ? ? None of the officers or men belonged to either of the two battalions which should have been there to attack the causeway ; but one officer , Lt. Col. Julian J. Ewell , was commander of a reserve battalion , and about half the men were his . The rest were staff officers , artillerymen without artillery , clerks , military police , the two generals and a war correspondent from Reuters . General Taylor put Ewell in charge of this curious outfit and told him to do what he could at the southern causeway . Julian Ewell was a professional officer , a graduate of West Point and young . at 77 twenty-eight , to be a colonel . This was his first combat , an important occasion in his career . He would have preferred to fight with his own battalion instead of with a lot of men who did not even know one another 's names . But parachutists learn to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a snowball , collecting wandering men in twos and threes . On the road to the causeway they approached a hamlet called Pouppeville . Rifle fire from its cottages brought Ewell 's column to a halt . He deployed his forces and began fighting the Germans from house to house with rifles and hand grenades . As the Germans retreated , the fight began to converge on the village school . A German lieutenant ran out of the schoolhouse toward Ewell , shouting . Ewell shot at him with his pistol and missed , and then realized that the man was trying to surrender , Twenty or thirty Germans came out of the school behind him , and Ewell 's first fight was over . Beyond the school the causeway could be seen  --  a narrow road with water on either side  --  and at the far end of it the sand dunes of Utah Beach . There seemed to be nobody on the road . But soon , in the reeds beside the causeway , a few small orange flags appeared . These were .. the signals of recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of air-borne and sea-borne forces . Ewell sent a few men down the road , and they came back escorting an officer , who reported to General Taylor . He was Capt . George Mabry , of the 8th Infantry Regiment . The parachutists looked at him rather like a man from another planet , for he had come by sea.
