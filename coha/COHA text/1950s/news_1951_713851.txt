txt The military honor of an anonymous and long-dead British officer , loosely accused of a Revolutionary " war crime , " is near vindication through tenacious detective work by a fellow Briton on a cold trail of 175-year-old clues . It is a question of who mortally wounded Gen. Nathaniel Woodhull of the Continental Army after his surrender near Jamaica on Aug. 28 ; 1776 . The inscription on the memorial cannon in the yard of Public School 35 , Hollis , Queens , has been sending pupils into the world ever since 1904 believing that it was a British officer who killed the American officer for his refusal to say " God Save the King . " Now , after two years of research , W. H. W. Sabine , English historian and author living at 197-09 Hollis Avenue , is convinced it is n't so . The job might have been done , he says , by a fanatical American loyalist  --  one Capt . Oliver DeLancey -- serving with the British against the patriots . Or , more likely , he feels , and more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stab in the arnf that caused his death ( a month later ) while " gallantly resisting capture , " not after his capture . The jury in this case , the school board for District 51 , is now out . It may decide at its June 6 meeting Whether to replace the inscription on P. S. 35 's artillery piece with the " open verdict " suggested by Mr. Sabine . It has been a long , uphill struggle to get the matter that far , Mr. Sabine reported . He first saw the inscription on a stroll shortly after his arrival in this country with his American wife in 194 ? . " That story seemed rather improbable on the face of it , " he said yesterday . " Officers of opposing // BOARD REVIEWING 1776 VAR CRIME ' // sides treated each other with the greatest respect , you know , in those days . " Mr. Sabine , former school teacher , historian and author of a work on supernormal phenomena , set about putting the record straight . Om dusty old scrapbook in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statement to a Lieut . Robert Troup , who was with him when he died in a British prison camp on Sept. 20 , 1776 . The general , according to Lieutenant Troup , said he had surrendered his sword to the American Tory DeLancey on the latter 's promise that he would observe the courtesies of war . Thereupon , General Woodhull continued , DeLancey struck him with his sword , wounding him in the arm . ? On the strength of this and other evidence , Mr. Sabine began a long correspondence with officials of the State Education Department and the Board of Education , requesting re-editing of the inscription at P. S. 35 . On April 13 Maximilian Moss , ? resident of the Board of Education , wrote that " steps that have peen taken to modify the inscripion on that monument " had been referred to the district school Board . Earlier Albert B. Corey , State 4istorian , had examined the evilence and recommended to the Board of Education that Mr. SaPine 's suggested wording might Nell be followed " from the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually happened . " What " actually happened , " in Mr. Sabine 's view , was indicated in the inscription he nominated to replace the old one : " Erected to the memory of General Nathaniel Woodhull , who , on August 28 , 1776 , near this spot , when surrounded by British forces and gallantly resisting capture , received wounds from which he died on September 20 in that year .
