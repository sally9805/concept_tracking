Hazel Flagg ( book by Ben Hecht ; music &; lyrics by Jule Styne and Bob Hillard ) is generally cheerful , insistently lavish and notably loud . Based on Nothing Sacred , a satiric Ben Hecht movie of the ' 30s the story tells of a vast fraud : a young Vermont girl pretends to be dying of radium poisoning and yearns for lights and laughter at the end . Hazel Flagg stands forth a creature of breathtaking gallantry , reduces the city to wild and wet-eyed idolatry , inspires everything from prayers to parades . <P> As satire , Hecht 's libretto is commonplace and even oafish ; certainly Hazel Flagg uses a maximum of heavy artillery to inflict a minimum of wounds . Once again musicomedy , in the act of satirizing something else , has ended by satirizing itself-by pointing up its own excesses of color , blare , manpower and above all , length . Jule Styne 's pounding music suggests a New York that never sleeps , and unconsciously gives the reason why Robert Alton 's dances get to be relentlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hazel Flagg , it might add up to a great deal more . <P> But even as primitive satire , the story is more tolerable than the usual musicomedy romance . There are some amusing burlesque ditties-Who Is the Bravest ? and Every Street 's a Boulevard in Old New York . There are glittering Miles White costumes and gay Harry Horner sets . As Hazel , Helen Gallagher is an attractive , versatile and spirited malade imaginaire . And , with New York for a locale and a tour of it as part of the plot , Hazel Flagg at times achieves the welcome variety and topicality of a revue.
