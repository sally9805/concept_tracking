In Washington , a favorite trick of politicos to undermine an opponent-or a trusting friend-is to " leak " uncomplimentary stories about him to newsmen . Last week the leak was briefly turned against Vice President Alben Barkley . The word was whispered around Washington that Alben Barkley could never run again for the vice presidency . " The old man , " said one Senator , " just ca n't take the grind any more . " Barkley , newsmen were told , has n't even enough strength left to preside over the daily sessions of the Senate , is forced to pass out the job to other Democratic Senators . Columnist Robert S. Allen dished out a full portion of his own inside dope : " Vice President Barkley is in serious danger of going blind . He has advanced cataracts on both his eyes . " <P> Actually , Barkley is feeling fine ; he is just a bit old ( 73 ) to be considered as a running mate for aging Harry Truman , who will be 68 at convention time . His eyesight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken no sudden turn for the worse . He shows up on the floor of the Senate almost every day , rotates the presiding chair in a system worked out by Democrats to share a wearisome job . ( Said a clerk : " It used to be a great honor ; now it 's a problem of who gets caught . " ) <P> At week 's end , New York Daily News Columnist John Crosson put his finger squarely on the main reasons for the leaks . Said he : " New York friends of Vice President Barkley . . . are turning a cold , hard gaze on current maneuverings of certain high Democratic strategists to dump the Vice President as Harry Truman 's running mate ... So let 's have an end to this sneaky attempt by political schemers to sell Alben short . He 's solid-and still aging in the wood . "
