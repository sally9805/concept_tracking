It was the roughest , bitterest brawl of the 86th Congress . Into Washington poured sacks full of mail from the folks back home . Lobbyists swarmed through Capitol corridors . Worried Congressmen cussed , consulted and conspired . Moving toward a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives was the year 's most intensely debated legislation : a labor bill aimed at ending the racketeering and hoodlumism that had become all too evident in some unions , especially the mighty International Brotherhood of Teamsters under its president , James Riddle Hoffa . The House had three choices before it : <P> THE SHELLEY BILL , sponsored by California Democrat John F. Shelley . Mildest of the three , it would merely require labor unions to open their books for inspection . It carried the faint blessing of A.F.L.-C.I.O . Chief George Meany , but not of Teamster Hoffa , who opposes reform of any kind . <P> THE ELLIOTT BILL , chaperoned by Alabama Democrat Carl Elliott . A step beyond the Shelley bill , it imposed some restrictions on blackmail picketing and secondary boycotts , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Kennedy-Erwin Labor bill ( TIME , May 4 ) , it was supported by the Democratic House leadership under Speaker Sam Rayburn . <P> THE LANDRUM-GRIFFIN BILL , jointly sponsored by Michigan Republican Robert P. Griffin and Georgia Democrat Phillip M. Landrum . More restrictive than the other bills , it imposed severe limitations on picketing and secondary boycotts , ordered labor leaders to respect rank-and-file rights under pain of jail sentences , extended state-court jurisdiction in labor disputes . The bill was backed by House Republicans and Southern conservatives , and got the nod of President Eisenhower . <P> Reversing the Trend . Fortnight ago , surveying his troops before the battle , G.O.P. Leader Charles Halleck knew he was in trouble in his effort to push across the Landrum-Griffin bill . Although his friend and coalition ally , Virginia Democrat Howard Smith , assured him that Southern conservatives were lined up solidly behind the bill , Halleck found that some 20 of his own Republicans , all from industrial areas , were prepared to go over the hill , vote for one of the weaker bills . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-driving methods had caused resentment among the G.O.P. rank and file , and he was in danger of losing even more Republicans . <P> In desperation , Halleck persuaded the President to go on television with an eloquent and perfectly timed appeal for strong labor reform . That reversed the trend : last week , on the eve of the great debate , the House got its biggest pile of mail since Harry Truman sacked General MacArthur .
