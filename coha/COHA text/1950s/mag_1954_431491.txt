People often say to me , " You are Fulton Oursler 's daughter ? How lucky you are to have had him as a father ! " And I agree . But I have always wanted to explain to them that it was not simply because he was a famous writer , or a devout Christian , or because his was such an exciting life , that I am lucky to be his daughter . It is because he understood the real meaning of what it is to be a father . He was the best friend I ever had . He was not , let me hurry to say , my " pal , " in the unrealistic way so many authorities recommend that parents be pals to their children . He never tried to come down to my level . He always lifted me up to his . I remember him in so many roles . As head of the household , unchallenged . As a craftsman , laboring to find the proper filigree of phrase to set off a jewel of thought . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a storyteller , a world traveler , a Parcheesi player with a wicked grin . Walking along the rocky beaches of Cape Cod with his favorite cane . Acting Hamlet from memory in his easy chair , conjuring up before my eyes the gloom of Elsinore . I remember the devil named Profolingo who lived in his elbow and who could whisk away the pain of a dirty and slightly bleeding knee . I remember him strutting and singing , " Bye Bye Blackbird , " with lather on his face , and dictating editorials in a beloved dressing gown with tattered sleeves . I remember him kneeling in prayer . But always I remember him as a person , not just as a father . And from the earliest times I can remember he treated me not just as a child but as a person he hoped to have as a friend for life . Beginning when I was only four , we used to go out together , just my father and I , on what he established as our " private dates . " No one else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we moved to Cape Cod , our dates led to the Woods Hole aquarium , or the Chatham lighthouse , or to rambling walks on strange beaches . Always I came home with a yellow balloon , and over strawberry sodas we congratulated ourselves that only the two of us knew it was chosen to match my room . As I grew older , our outings became more sophisticated ? luncheon at an exclusive restaurant , a Broadway matinee . But the principle was the same . With elegant courtliness my father was letting me know he considered me an interesting companion . And I thought then , as I do now , that he was fascinating ! Those dates were pure fun . They were definitely not designed as educational projects . The fact that I learned something each time was due to the simple fact that no one could spend ten minutes with Fulton Oursler without coming away richer in thought ? even at the lollipop age . He knew true stories about everything and delighted in telling them . He found sermons not only in stones but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as running brooks . History I learned from him , biography . and geography without maps , but chiefly I learned to be excited about a world that even to a child can at times look soiled , and tired , and dull . Enthusiasm was the key to my father 's life . Like so many other prominent men of his time , he never finished school . He had a healthy admiration for formal education . He thrilled with pleasure when his children won scholastic honors . He was proud and a little amazed at his own honorary degrees . I 'll never forget his chortle and his shyness when he arrived at my college graduation bearing the degree he had been awarded only the day before . He knew where we went . We were . for those stolen hours , two kids playing hooky , two equals escaping the trammels of schedules and snoopers to be ourselves , together . When we lived in New York , we sometimes rode the elevated train , just gawking and riding from one end of the line to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to puppet shows and to the big sloppy Fulton Street fish market to see ships dock with their catch . We found the Whispering Corner in Grand Central Terminal . We sailed away on the Staten Island ferry , knowing that for a few enchanted minutes of that trip we were actually afloat said he was relieved to have been graduated before I was . But even without degrees , he was a master teacher . He had taught himself everything , from sleight of hand to languages . His own taskmaster , he had learned the technique of writing the hard way , earning his living by his pen at sixteen . He made himself an expert in the history of the French Revolution , in the annals of crime , world literature .. and comparative religion . He could tell you everything from the reason for the number of stones in the Great Pyramid to the precise way to prepare cafe diable ? and make it interesting .  | He had a child 's gift of savoring excitement . To him even routine moments of life were an adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand were those who were bored . From the moment we could talk he taught us how to ferret marvels from the monotony of everyday . Like all amiable fathers , he would frequently ask us children what we had been doing . We would tell him , but never in an ordinary way . He wanted what he called a " chronnie , " a chronology precise in detail . " I went over to Dot 's house and played in the barn , and then ? " " No , no . What did you see on the way there ? What did you think ? And how did it feel ? Pretend you 're a reporter writing a story ; you 've got to catch my interest in the lead paragraph or I 'll turn the page . " He wanted to know how high the goldenrod stood along the short cut by our home at Cape Cod and whether the cranberry bogs were reddening . He wanted to hear about the kittens at Jeanne 's house and the smell of the hay in the Burke barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember and express what we had experienced , but to share his enthusiasm for the smallest data of living . Few grownups ever enjoy the luxury of a good listener . Children have an even harder time being heard . But to my father we were not merely offspring but people , and as such deserved the courtesy of attention . And because he gave it to us , we tried hard to be worthy of it , and we grew up a little faster . He always respected our ideas , halfgrown though they might be . He would debate with us our opinions of the local football team , the theory of evolution , the best way to raise a tadpole in my room , or the relative merits of Longfellow and the English poets . He loved Longfellow . I despise him . We had fun disagreeing . Reading was his dearest pastime , and it became mine . With his help I found myself deep in Dickens and Dumas years ahead of my school classes , not out of duty but solely for pleasure . Except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading matter . Once he noticed that for weeks I had been slushing through piles of comic books to the exclusion of everything else . He asked me why . " I think it might help me appreciate other things if I read some bad literature , " I alibied solemnly . I can still see his smile . " Really ? Tell me , how many bad eggs do you have to eat before you appreciate the taste of a good one ? " I quit the comic books that night , even though I had secretly planned to defy him if he forbade them . H E WAS always proud that he had never written anything he could not permit his children to read . With intense excitement I received my autographed copies of his books fresh off the press . One of the brightest memories of my childhood is of a stormy day when I was eleven . Sitting before the picture window in his library , staring out at the gray sea , listened to him read aloud the first version of the trial scene from what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than ten years went into the research and writing of that book , and we lived it with him every step of the way . He paid us the compliment of wanting our reactions . I shall never forget the sheer pleasure of having him alter a word in a manuscript to another I suggested . The change did not mean much to the article he was writing , but it meant a lot to me . It was another proof that in his eyes I was a person whose opinion was to be respected , and not just an unco-ordinated teen-ager . He never discounted our opinions or condescended to them . Once I came home to announce with pig-tailed vehemence that I considered advertising an unmitigated evil . My father was then editor in chief of Macfadden Publications . Magazines survive on the investments of advertisers . But while I talked over my full dinner plate , he never stopped me to remind me that our food was an indirect result of the advertising I was condemning . He listened courteously . He explained why he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual and historical premises , not on any personal or expedient ones . And then , deciding that my opinions , though incorrect , might be shared by intelligent adults , he launched a series of magazine articles to answer them . He convinced me , and thousands of others , of the practical importance and value of advertising . It 's an odd feeling to know that people all over the country are reading something that resulted directly from what you said at dinner ! THE dinner table was our forum , our theatre , and , incidentally , our best schoolroom . My father loved games that made you think ? twenty questions , for example , or one he invented , called Ethical Problems , which sounds dull but was n't . He geared the problems to our age group . " Suppose you are in school . You see Clara take something out of Betsy 's locker . She does not see you . Later you hear that Betsy 's pocketbook had been stolen from that locker . What would you do ? " " Tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But suppose Clara had only taken a notebook out of the locker , with Betsy 's full knowledge and permission ? You 've shown you 're not only a tattletale but a heck of a friend to think Clara could be a thief ! " " Oh . Well , I 'd have to tell someone about it . " " Why ? You do n't know for sure what you saw . If you were asked what you did see , you 'd have to tell precisely the facts . You are a witness . But who are you to judge what it meant ? " Slowly , with my own mind , in a situation I could appreciate , I learned that night the meaning of the words , " Judge not , that ye be not judged . " But ten years later , when he rephrased the problem to ask me what I would do if I saw my best friend 's husband wining and dining a blonde , I must confess I fell into the trap again . Can you ever tell a lie with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cheek ? Is it ever just that you should pay for another 's mistake ? Suppose one of your coworkers is shirking his job ? what should you do ? Suppose you make a verbal contract to rent a room from a landlady who needs the money and who turns away other roomers for you . You live with her a while , and then find you can live with a friend for nothing . What should you do ? If you should discover that your husband is secretly in an illegal business and that therefore you have been living off stolen money , what should you do ? The answers to these and a hundred other questions we worked out over cups of cocoa and coffee . To this day when I get into a difficult spot , I play the game again in my mind to find a solution . And I remember that even then my father used to say , " No one can tell you what to do . They can tell you what is right . But until you make your own decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no good . " STILL , even with the ethical problems , we were no angels . I for one was at times a very bad child . I told some lies , and I swiped things , and I was punished . But far more devastating than any discipline I ever received was the deep sadness that would come into my father 's eyes when I had done wrong . From that look of love and disappointment I began to understand the yearning of the Good Shepherd , who goes in search of the one lost sheep , and the joy of the father of the prodigal son . Actually it was through my father that I first learned about God ? and that was at a time when he himself had no religion . During the years of my childhood he was a skeptic , an agnostic . Yet just by being my father , he unconsciously taught me more than he himself knew then . What I want to say is difficult to put into words . In this age of popular psychology it could easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not overestimate my father . I loved him , but I am the victim neither of hero worship nor of that much abused concept of abnormal psychology , the Oedipus complex . I knew his faults . I have seen him with egg on his tie and with unbecoming anger on his face . But from babyhood he taught me to appreciate the secrets of God . All fathers , whatever their failings , do the same . There is a reason why God has taught us to call Him " Father " ? why whitebeards and children alike repeat " Our Father , who art in heaven . " God in all His glory is beyond human understanding . But God the Father is not . In each family all over the world the father bears a sacred responsibility . He is for the child the first contact with the idea of God , because his name and God 's are the same . Good fathers want their children to grow into righteous , successful men and women ; so does God want each soul to grow till it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet they chastise them till they learn to do better . In the same way God forgives us , and yet He makes us pay the price of our sins . No real father will refuse to help his child . He will not coddle it , but neither will he let it carry a burden beyond its strength . Neither will God . But fathers must do even more than that , else they run the risk of going too far and believing that they are God . No father in the world , mine included , can remain supreme in the eyes of his own  | children forever . Yet if they have bee : . friends , no disillusionment , no argument . no difference of belief can separate them long . I remember my complete horror and shame when I first learned that my father had " got religion . " I was sixteen a rather haughty college sophomore , majoring in philosophy . I could prove there was no God . And I came home to hear my father . the skeptic , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I confess I thought he had lost his mind . For a while I was very rude . I laughed at him . I pleaded with him . tried arguing with him , but no matter how blistering and superbly logical my attack , I got only gentle and supremely confident answers . Finally I decided the nicest thing I could do was to ignore the whole affair . And I honestly grieved for my father , who had in his dotage succumbed to the superstitions of Christianity . Six years passed . Six years wher. neither of us mentioned religion to each other , for just as I did not want to embarrass him , he did not want to force his ideas upon me . I was aware that he yearned to share this , his greatest excitement , with me , and that he was praying for me , quietly and without outward show . Actually it was not my father but the man who was to become my husband who made me see . But he did not do it alone . My father 's prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more telling , perhaps , were the years of mutual respect and friendship he had shared with me and the truths he had taught me about religion so long before . It was then my father said , " April , I 've been waiting so long for you to grow up . And now that you have , wo n't we have fun ? " We had more than that .  |
