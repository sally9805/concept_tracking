txt The French Government has informed its allies that it favors linking disarmament and the unification of Germany . It now suggests that agreements to reduce arms should proceed phase by phase in conjunction with advances toward German unity . This reversal of what had appeared to be the French position served to overcome a serious breach in Western solidarity just before a session of the North Atlantic Council that was designed to strengthen that solidarity . It was understood this revised French policy was one of the main topics discussed today between Secretary of State Dulles and Christian Pineau , French Foreign Minister . Mr. Dulles reached Paris today for the meetings Friday and Saturday of the council , which will be devoted to closer coordination of the political and economic policies of the alliance it directs . Western Position Clarified According to officials here , what the French Government has done is to re-establish the common Western position on the German problem that was firmly taken at the two Geneva conferences last year , but appeared to have been abandoned within the last two months by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem has long been considered the touchstone of Western policy toward the Soviet Union . Consequently the return of the Socialist-led French Government to the position of its predecessor of giving German unity priority over security agreements appears to restore unanimity on this point among the fifteen members of the North Atlantic alliance . The apparent breach in this unity caused by the policy or the obscurities of M. Mollet and M. Pineau had shocked West German leaders . It also had greatly troubled those in France who considered a. solid FrenchGerman agreement as the indispensable basis of Western solidarity and of any common steps toward European union . Therefore , new instructions have been sent to Jules Mach , French member of the United Nations subcommittee on disarmament meeting in London . These instructions subordinate the application of steps toward reduced armaments to steps toward German unity . Copies of // these instructions are understood to have been handed to the West German , British and United States Governments . The basis of the new instructions was reported to be much the same as that of the Western proposals linking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would proceed by stages . The first stage was understood to entail the announcement of existing military levels , which would become maximums , with the exception of West Germany 's , which would be that of the approximately 500,000-man force provided in the Paris agreements of 1954 to arm West Germany . The second stage , it was understood , would entail the establishment of arms controls and some reduction provided first steps were taken toward German unification . Reduction of armaments would proceed parallel with German unification . A very different policy has been attributed to M. Mollet and NI , Moch . They appeared to foresee a possible disarmament agreement that would give West Germany fewer troops than those provided in the Paris agreements , or . as some put it , that would undermine the Paris agreements and postpone German unification in the interest of a disarmament accord with Moscow . In his speech seeking the premiership , M. Mollet proposed to break the deadlock resulting from the Geneva conferences by negotiations on disarmament , In an interview early in April he said that a solution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " within the framework of security the unification of Germany would be easier to attain . " This was widely interpreted as indicating that agreements on armaments might precede agreements on Germany . In the same interview , M. Mollet said the number of troops provided for West Germany would become " totally different " once a disarmament agreement was signed . He added that this did not imply that West Germany would cease to belong to the Atlantic alliance but that the future status of that country could not now be foreseen . The French and British Governments recently submitted a common disarmament plan to the United Nations subcommittee . The new French instructions are understood now to make this plan dependent upon agreement on German unification . Economic Role Indicated M. Pineau is understood to have told Mr. Dulles today that he would propose to the North Atlantic Council a new international economic agency under the United Nations to coordinate economic aid to under-developed nations . It had been suggested that the principal policy-making role in this field might be acquired by the North Atlantic Council , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of this week 's meeting of the council is to discuss possible political and economic functions of the alliance . hitherto preoccupied mainly by organizing the defense of West Europe . The Council faces a dilemma . On the one hand , it recognizes the widespread view that its defensive functions are less necessary , or at least less urgent , today and it desires to counteract this view by emphasizing that there should be no relaxation in the defense build-up . On the other hand , it feels obliged to justify and preserve the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by giving it new and non-military tasks . Officials assume that after their two-day session the foreign ministers of the fifteen nations in the alliance will tive a directive to the Permanent Council in Paris to study or define these new tasks , which will be political and perhaps economic also . There was no expectation among officials here that the ministers would go far in committing themselves to a precise policy on foreign aid or other possible future functions of the alliance .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
