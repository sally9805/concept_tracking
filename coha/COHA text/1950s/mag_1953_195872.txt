MORE DENNIS THE MENACE ( 64 pp. - Hank Ketcham-Holt ( $ I ) . <P> A four-year-old with a posterior no larger than the palm of an irate parent 's hand is rapidly becoming the nation 's most popular towhead . As a comic-strip character , Dennis the Menace is practically a member of the family for the readers of 200 U.S. newspapers . But this little one-man gang has also become something of a sensation between book covers . Dennis the Menace , published last September , has already sold close to 140,000 copies . Even a publisher could guess the sequel to that : More Dennis the Menace . <P> Dennis wears well , much better than the frayed tempers of his parents and the other unlucky grownups who have to deal with him . Not every youngster of four is original enough to throw rice pudding instead of rice as the newlyweds leave the church . And not too many grasp the basic economic facts of life so quickly . Says Dennis in answer to a slower kid 's question : " Father 's Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , only you can buy a cheaper present . " <P> If a poll were taken , it would probably show that Dennis ' hottest fans are grownups . If he does nothing else , he makes mothers and fathers realize how lucky they are ; Dennis might have been theirs . Dennis is fairly sure of a long life . After all , he can say and do what he likes ; he has nothing to lose but his supper .
