A Story by DON MOSER THE ROCK CLIMB W M E WEN T down into the woods toward the stream , el swinging easily ahead of me through the open pine forest . I watched his back , the small pack high on his shoulders and his left arm hanging awkwardly , and I had to hurry a little to keep up , like always . Yesterday climbing Mt . Mansfield I had taken the lead so that I set a pace I could keep . Whenever he led I hated to ask him to slow down and I always got blown pretty fast . Mansfield had been easy , just like walking upstairs for a few miles with nothing dangerous . about it . We sat down on the rocks On top and had a cigarette . I was glad for the chance to relax  --  for three days Mel had been pushing me just as he had pushed his squad in Georgia . We stretched out there on the rocks and looked over the spread of the Green Mountains and the blue slash of Lake Champlain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer to a college in Vermont . On the way down we had stopped at the foot of a rock face and worked two or three pitches . Mel taught me some of the climbing lingo and showed me how to tie into the rope and how to make a belay and three or four different holds . Then he did a layback on a short pitch but I said that I was too tired to try it . He did n't press me , but he looked at me and then at the rock as though he did n't quite believe me . This morning we came through Stowe and drove several miles on side roads before Mel pulled the car off and parked . He said there was an easy climb a mile back in through the woods . I thought it would be nice just to take the binoculars and the camera and follow the stream down , but Mel said if we were . going to do Katandin I 'd better get a couple of easier things under my belt first . When we hit the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we finally found a place where we could cross on the rocks , and even thenthere was a lot of white water and the rocks were small and far apart . I was a little wary of it and I said , " This does n't look very good . " Mel looked at me a- nd rubbed his bad arm and frowned . He slipped out of the pack straps and sprawled his lean body on the pine needles at the edge of the stream . He twisted the wire from his hearing aid around his finger , then said . " When you looked me up last week I thought you really wanted to do some climbing . When we used to talk about it back in basic training you said you wanted to learn and I thought you meant it . " " Well , I do . " I kicked at the pine . needles with my boot . " We climbed yesterday , did n't we ? " " I know , but we only have a few more days before you start school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course we can just go for a walk along the stream and look for wild flowers or something , if you want to . " " Look , Mel , I 'm not in the shape I was in basic training  --  I have n't done any daily dozens in a long time . I was n't any platoon leader running around the Korean hills , remember . I sat on my can in Georgia and administered intelligence tests for two years . " " We could cache the gear , " he said , standing up again . " And it would be easier to cross and we would n't have to carry it . " I hesitated for a moment , kicking up the pine needles with my hoot . Mel looked at me and rubbed his arm slowly . " I 'm not in the shape I was in basic either , " he said . That got to me , when I thought about the arm and the hearing aid he 'd brought back from Korea . " Should we leave the rope too ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We wo n't need it for anything up there . " We put the rope and the knapsacks and the camera under the trunk of a down hemlock and then we crossed the stream , jumping from stone to stone fast because if you do n't keep your enough to get my foot into and it was starting to get shallow . Water ran down the rock from a spring up above and algae grew along the crack . It was slippery as hell and the soles of my boots were wet and slick . Mel helped me more and more from below , guiding my feet with his hand . The face was much smoother now ; there were few projections to cling to . Those there were were wet and slippery . Then there were n't any and I could n't go anywhere . " I 'm stuck , " I said . " There 's no handholds . " " Use opposite pressure . " " What ? " " Opposite pressure , like I showed you yester-day . " I remembered now . 1 was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , putting one hand on each side of the crack and then pulling apart , and it worked . I moved up a little . It went on like that for the next twenty feet , me getting pretty scared and not being able to figure out what ' to do , Mel talking me up the pitch foot by foot . 1 slopped once to take a breather and relax my muscles . " It 's my fault , " Mel said . " I should have known enough to bring the rope . " " That 's all right , " I said , wishing it were there so I could feel it across my belly , but knowing that it would n't be much good here anyway . We did n't have any pitons and there was no place to make a belay unless Mel stayed back at the chockstone , and I could n't go any place without him right behind me . " We could go back down if you like , " he said . I thought about it for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn quits on it now when he knew that I could keep going if I wanted to . I looked down and then right back and I did n't have to think about it any more . Going down backwards and having to keep looking down over my shoulder would be more than I could take . " No , let 's finish it , " I said . I MADE it up another ten feet and we were pretty close now . The lowest of the scrubby little cedars was growing from a fissure only about a dozen feet above me . I was soaking wet from sweating and the water running down the rock . My fingers were tired and my left palm was bleeding and my ankles were sore from twisting my feet into the crack , but another dozen feet and we 'd have it . There was n't much left of the crack , just room to jam a toe into , and the rock face to theleft and right looked smooth and straight . There was n't any place to go out there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shallow crack and my left foot was on a small chockstone . I grubbed the fingers of my right hand into a crevice , then felt about with my left . Above my head the crack petered out to nothing . I felt around on the wet rock as far as I could reach above and to the left , but there was n't anything there . I turned my head back to look . There was a knobby projection three or four inches across where the strata split up above my head . I stretched my left hand up as far as it would go but I was still a foot short . " Look , I 'm hung up , " I said over my shoulder . " I 've got to get up about a foot before I can reach a hold and I 'm afraid to put all my weight on my left foot . This stone is n't very tight . " I could feel it wobble under my toe while I listened to Mel moving up below me . I was getting pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to knot up . I rubbed it with my left hand . After a while I heard Mel say from beneath my feet , " Listen , I ca n't get to you until you move off that stone . It 's the only thing there is to hold . " " Well , I do n't think I can go up any higher . " " Hang on then and I 'll try to traverse around you and get to you from above . " I thought about the face on both sides and it seemed that he might as well jump off as try to do a traverse across that smooth rock . Then I looked up at the knob above my head and I wobbled the chockstone under my toe . " Wait a minute , " I said . " No , maybe I can make it . I 'll see . " I rested there for a minute , thinking about it . Then I shoved up as fast as I could on my left foot with my fingers reaching for the knob . The stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers held in the crevice just long enough to get my right foot in the crack and jam it I hung there clinging and hearing the chockstone hit down below and then hit again and again and finally land rolling on the rocks two hundred feet below . There was nothing for my left loot and nothing for my left hand . I was just clinging there all stretched out and wondering how long my grip was good for and knowing that if I moved I was going down there with the stone . " I ca n't move , " I said , with my face pressed right against the rock . " I ca n't move from here . "
