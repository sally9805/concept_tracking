The living room of MISS MABEL 's farmhouse on the outskirts of a small village near Montrelle , Ga . It is a pleasant room : very clean and feminine . Two large windows - occasionally used as a doorway - look out across a neat flower garden which fades into the surrounding farm land . A shabby little church with its tower leaning and its roof sagging down in the middle like a sway-back horse is noticeable in the distance that lies beyond . In the vicinity of the church are a few other buildings and houses - mostly shanties . The door is to the right . A fireplace and a mantle topped with a mirror are to the left . An ancient clock and bric-a-brac fill the mantle . Along the wall above the mantle are several photographs . Among these are two life-size bust pictures . They are larger than the others and are identical ; thus dominate the collection . Black mourning cloth partly draped over one of the identical photographs and fully covering the mirror connotes a funereal feeling for the otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. ILAHEE is humming as she sweeps a few flower petals from the floor upon a sheet of newspaper . After gathering up the newspaper , she hobbles to the fireplace and discards it . Fiftiesh and plump , Mrs. ILAHEE limps with the weight of her right foot which is bundled in white rags . Aided by a walking cane and with some straining effort , she mounts a chair and starts removing the black mourning cloth from the photo . As the face on the photo is exposed , she grunts twice , rather dryly . There is a sly touch of mischievous formality in her sadness . The doorbell buzzes and she reacts , startled : ILAHEE Who that ? p. 3 PETER ( Off stage ) It 's me - - ILAHEE And who 's me ? PETER Pete - Mrs. Ilahee . It 's Pete . ILAHEE Come on in , Pete . ( In dismounting , SHE drops her cane . Turning and bending to retrieve it , SHE does n't see PETER enter . SHE continues talking right through his entrance ) Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't passed since the procession left the church . ( PETER has entered hurriedly . He is an intelligent-looking young man - carrying carpenter tools wrapped up in his jacket and somewhat ill-at-ease in the overalls he is wearing ) PETER Good evening , ma'am . I got a letter from Miss Mabel asking me to be here this afternoon - - - ILAHEE ( Seeing him - surprisingly ) That outfit ! What 'd you do ? Attend the funeral or serve on the burial squad ? PETER ( Laying aside his paraphernalia ) I did n't attend the burial , ma'am . As a matter of fact , I did n't attend the funeral either . ILAHEE ( Dryly ) Humph - - you do n't say ! ( SHE thoroughly understands his reply now , but wo n't press the issue ) p. 4 PETER ( Determined - xing to her ) I do n't believe in going to funerals unless you 're invited . ILAHEE You do n't wait to be invited . You go out of respect and regard . PETER I had no respect nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Though no sooner than I heard about her death three days ago , I sent my brother over with roses . ILAHEE That was mighty sweet of you sonny boy - when you know Irma Fletcher had rose fever . ( Resumes chores ) PETER What else could I do ? ILAHEE Do n't mind me . It 's Miss Mabel who - - - PETER Miss Mabel understands . She knows I 'll do anything in the world for her . She 's a sweet woman . But that sister of hers was a - - pistol . Well - the old girl has shot her last bullet , now . I ca n't say I 'm sorry . ILAHEE ( Stopping him , such thoughts should n't be spoken ) Hush your mouth - - PETER ( Xing to photo ) Her hate used to creep over me - ( Shudders ) - - like fleas on a hound dog . She 's buried and gone . You ought to bury the picture , too . p. 5 ILAHEE Here , help me straighten up before Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I suppose you 're going to tell me your rheumatic foot 's the reason why you did n't attend the funeral . ILAHEE Why should I spatter your face with a lie like that ? PETER Well  --  you 're here - and not at the funeral . ILAHEE Miss Mabel wanted me to be here because she is expecting somebody . Shake out that drape before you fold it . ( Takes one end of drape , PETER takes the other . BOTH shake it ) PETER ( Stooping ) People do n't have parties after funerals , do they ? ILAHEE I 've known families shout with joy over the passing of some no-account . But I 've never heard of anybody happy enough over a death to throw a party . PETER Well - who is Miss Mabel expecting so special ? ILAHEE Some man from New York . PETER I 'm suspicious of anybody from New York . ( Folding drape towards her , BOTH collide ) ILAHEE ( Yells , painfully ) Gawd ! That 's my foot when you get through with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to slap you into the middle of next week . PETER ( Kneeling , rubs and grips the bandaged foot ) Please forgive me , Mrs. Ilahee  - -   - -   ILAHEE My foot ai n't the woman you love , so stop hugging it . PETER I 'm really sorry , ma'am . ILAHEE Sorrow wo n't help it . Go get me that Sloan 's liniment . PETER Yes , ma'am  - -  -  ( Exits into kitchen ) ILAHEE Walking around in a dream . Love 's ganged up on your brain and crowded all the sense out of your head . Boy - , if you do n't hurry up and get married  - -  -  PETER ( Offstage ) Ma'am , I do n't see the liniment . ( Re-enters ) ILAHEE With your eyes hatching romance in full bloom , you ca n't see anything . I 'll get it myself . ( Taps his rear with cane ) And if you skinned my foot , you can tell your behind goodbye ! ( Exits hobbling on cane ) ( PETER pauses regretfully , then throws a quick glance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase . One by one HE pulls the petals from the flower , determining her destiny ) p. 7 PETER Hey - Mrs. Ilahee - where do you think Mrs. Fletcher went - to heaven or hell ? ILAHEE ( Offstage ) If I get a letter from her , I 'll give you her address . PETER ( Has determined the answer , cast the last petal ) She went to hell , Mrs. Ilahee . ILAHEE That 's no news to me . ( MARY enters . SHE is a pretty honey-colored girl appropriately saddened by the recent bereavement . SHE stops center , abruptly , and stares at Peter , reproachfully ) PETER Why - Mary - - what are you doing here ? MARY Where 's Mrs. Ilahee ? PETER Out in the kitchen - throwing a much needed fit because I accidentally stepped on her foot . MARY And you stand there like a sad calf ! ( Xing towards kitchen ) I 'll help you , Mrs. Ilahee . ILAHEE ( Offstage ) Never mind me - I 'll live . ( MARY stops ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who needs help . Mary - why do n't you marry this scamp and put him out of misery . PATER Listen , Mary , what 's wrong ? p. 8 MARY I 'm ashamed of you . I never dreamed you 'd not attend the funeral . PETER ( Xing , exposing a letter ) I got a letter from Miss Mabel . It invites me to be here at three o'clock . It does n't say anything about coming to the funeral . MARY You were invited to be here at three . Well - so was I ! PETER What is this all about ? I went to work this morning two hours ahead of time - and worked like a horse  --  to be here by three . MARY I 'm sure - Miss Mabel will appreciate the sacrifice you 've made to be here . But how she 'll feel about your lack of respect for her sister . PETER I 'm sorry . I ca n't stir up enough sympathy to weep over Mrs. Fletcher 's death . MARY ( Xing to him ) Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was practically your aunt . PETER You did n't live with blessed Aunt Irma . If you had you 'd drop bricks into her coffin instead of tears . MARY I admit she was disagreeable - But now that she 's gone , you must forgive and forget . PETER How can I forget her putting me out seven years ago . p. 9 MARY She did n't put you out . You left on your own . PETER What 's the difference ? She kicked up such a stir with Miss Mabel , I had to leave so that dear woman could have some peace . MARY You should have stayed regardless . PETER You remember - you even stopped visiting Miss Mabel when Mrs. Fletcher came back here to live . MARY I paid my respects to her to-day out of regard for Miss Mabel . It was the decent thing to do ! PETER ( Xing to her tenderly ) Unlike you , Mary - I 'm not the sweetest thing God ever breathed life into -- - MARY ( Tightens ) Oh - stop it , Peter ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late . PETER ( Puzzled ) Before it 's too late ? MARY ( Nervously ) When they started dropping dirt on Mrs. Fletcher 's casket - ( With forced control ) I thought of another casket being covered --  --  ( Closing her eyes , she gestures weakly . PETER goes to her , consolingly ) Waiting for you to marry me is becoming harder and harder . p. 10 PETER ( Delicately ) Oh  - -   - -  you just got a hangover  - -   - -   MARY I could n't stand the thought - - I left before the burial was over . ( Pause , then strongly ) This- this blue print you 've planned of our lives is full of holes anyway . PETER Children will come between us and death , Mary -- - MARY If we are spared , yes --  ! PETER ( Cheerfully ) Oh - I 'll be around long enough to support one robust little scamp - one mischievous enough , like me , to annoy you to no end . MARY This is no time for joking . PETER I 'm not . If and when Pete Junior kicks himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not be brought up in the home of charitable neighbors . MARY Miss Mabel brought you up like a son - and not because your family was poor . PETER For which yours truly is grateful - - How many Mabels are there in this world ? How many such good souls are willing to help raise families of fourteen ? Perhaps one in a million . MARY If we 'd go on and get married - Miss Mabel might ask us to live here - since her sister 's gone now --  p. 11 PETER ( After a pause - peeved ) We live here ! I - I could n't ! She 's done enough already ! MARY Just until we get on our feet -- till we get started . PETER No - I will not -- - ( Xing to fireplace ) It 's - it 's like begging for dessert- after being given dinner . ( Kicks his foot in the fireplace ) MARY ( There is a long pause , then wistfully ) You 're still the kid of seven I first met - sitting here with his toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My toes were n't in the ashes . It was peanuts , parching ! MARY You would n't remember . You were so busy building a toy house . PETER I remember well enough . Miss Mabel introduced us . I scrambled so fast to kiss you , I burned my foot . MARY And then went right on building the toy house . PETER It became our house then . MARY You 're still trying to turn the toy house into a real one . Yet the barn for the chickens is still a dream . PETER You go to the funeral - then come back here with your thinking all tangled up . Do n't shake my faith in our future , Mary . You must believe in me -- - p. 12 MARY ( Resigningly ) What else can I do ? PETER ( With relief ) That 's my girl ! For a moment you sounded like Mrs. Fletcher had lifted the lid off her casket - and was changing the course of our lives . Her influence in life was bad enough . Let 's not invite her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booked and arranged in the next world . If they find out what made her so evil , it 'll be more than what we 've learned . MARY ( Lightly ) She was nasty because Miss Mabel is so nice . Everybody in town likes Miss Mabel . Mrs. Fletcher could n't compete , and she got sour and jealous . PETER She was really --  --  ( ILAHEE enters with a paper box ) Mrs. Ilahee - honestly , just what did you think of Mrs. Fletcher ? ILAHEE ( Quickly ) That woman was a confirmed - bitch ! ( Palms her mouth , shamefully . PETER pantomimes : " WHY , Mrs. ILAHEE " and shakes her hand , after she sets box , there is a knock at the door . ILAHEE answers the door ) ( WATKINS enters , sourly . HE is a short , but burly farmer with a weather-beaten face . HE is dressed in his Sunday-go-to-meeting best suit , a Hoover collar and brilliantly shined shoes that squeak ; he carries a derby hat . He looks as if he has been polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breast pocket ) p. 13 PETER Good evening , Mr. Watkins . JEREMIAH Howdy , Pete . I see you got here ahead of me , Mary . MARY I ran from the burial . JEREMIAH I should have . ILAHEE ( Packing drapes in box ) Just who did go to the funeral ? JEREMIAH Mrs. Fletcher . ( ILAHEE bristles  --  WATKINS crosses and sits in the chair against the wall . ILAHEE twitches her nose ) ILAHEE Mary  --  you might bring in some more flowers . I get a whiff of something else in this room besides us three . ( WATKINS re-acts guiltily as MARY smiles at him and exits into the garden via the double window . ILAHEE places the box on the table ) JEREMIAH There was a draft wheezing through the church . ILAHEE To let you tell it - there 'll be a draft in heaven . ( Throws on her shawl ) JEREMIAH You 'll never get there to find out . ILAHEE If I get there first , I 'll darn well see that you do n't . PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 14 ILAHEE And why not ? ( Xing to door ) I was only staying until that man got here from New York . But now one of you can let him in . JEREMIAH ( Gruffly ) Nobody invited her anyway . ILAHEE You need n't sit there like God 's first cousin . Miss Mabel - wants to tell you that Mrs. Fletcher 's dying words was for you to bring back them potatoes you stole from her last year ! ( Exits - slamming the door ) ( WATKINS puckers his lips , embarrassingly , then places his hat on the floor near him ) PETER You got a note too ? JEREMIAH ( Bluntly ) Yep . PETER Why ? JEREMIAH Dam-fi-no . PETER How was the funeral ? JEREMIAH ( Pause ) No pep to it . PETER Naturally . JEREMIAH Whiskey usually makes me cry . This time it did n't , so I left . PETER I did n't want to go . JEREMIAH I could 've told ' em this funeral would be no good . If I had my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonfire and scattered her ashes over the crop for fertilizer --  --  p. 15 PETER Mary thinks I should have attened , but -- - JEREMIAH ( Condoningly ) Aw -- wo n't nobody there but the preacher and his wife , the doctor , Miss Mabel and Mary --  --  PETER Being so -- - ( Wrinkles his nose )  - -  even that was a crowd . JEREMIAH Young - she was n't so bad . I remember when their father died and left ' em this farm betwix ' em . They was pretty as pictures . Being twins made ' em even more so --  --  --  ( Grumbling , half inarticulately ) Fifteen minutes - hugh - fifteen minutes --  --  PETER What about fifteen minutes ? JEREMIAH Irma was the bossy one because she thought she was fifteen minutes older . That woman ! Lord ! She was some high and mighty when she fell head over heels in love with that New York soldier in 1918 - stationed over at Fort Benning and married him . Poor sonvagun got the war and Fletcher . PETER I bet he wished he had n't . JEREMIAH Oh - he stuck it out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that - can stand anything . He left her gobs of money , though you 'd never think so , the way she sponged on Miss Mabel and me --  --  p. 16 PETER Sponged on you ! JEREMIAH I sharecropped this farm all my life . She come back here and cut my share from a half to a fourth . PETER That 's right . But I thought it was a third . JEREMIAH ( Bangs the table ) A lousy stinking twenty-five percent . I 've been hiring myself out by the day to make ends meet . ( There is a knock at the door . PETER answers the door ) PETER Wo n't you come in ? ( SMALLWOOD enters carrying an airplane bag and briefcase . HE is an important-looking , well dressed man who tries hard to bestow the proper courtesies without exposing his innate air of superiority . From time to time he conspicuously dangles his Phi Beta Kappa key to remind the less fortunate of his status ) MR . SMALLWOOD Good afternoon . My name is Smallwood . PETER How do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attorney . PETER Oh - you must be the gentleman Miss Mabel 's expecting . ( Takes his airplane bag ) MR . SMALLWOOD You are - er - Mr. Barlow ? p. 17 PETER Yes sir  --  yes , I am  --  ( PETER 's surprise causes him to pause . MARY enters with an armful of flowers . PETER reaches for the briefcase , but SMALLWOOD has crossed to Mary ) MR . SMALLWOOD And this young lady must be Mary Rowland . MARY ( Pauses as SHE places flowers on table ) That 's right . How are you  - -  -  JEREMIAH ( Cutting in ) And can you put a name to me too ? MR . SMALLWOOD ( Hesitatingly ) Let me see  - -  -  you must be  - -  -  Mr. Watkins  --  Jeremiah Watkins . JEREMIAH ( Shaking hands ) Well - I would n't know you from Adam , except as they say , you dress different . MR . SMALLWOOD You see , I was expecting to meet you people . I have all your names here . ( Patting his briefcase ) You all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Referring to Smallwood 's last remark ) Mary - you hear that ! MARY I ca n't believe it . JEREMIAH What is this benefish business ? p. 18 MR . SMALLWOOD A beneficiary is a person who benefits , Mr. Watkins . JEREMIAH Maybe we benefit because she 's dead . How much you trying to collect ? MR . SMALLWOOD Mr. Watkins - I am not trying to collect anything . It is you who - - PETER Mr. Smallwood means - - ( Literally spelling it out ) Mrs. Fletcher has left you something in her will ! JEREMIAH He never said that . ( Pause ) PETER Well - that 's what he means . JEREMIAH Will he put it in writing ? Last contract I had with a lawyer , I ended up on the paying side - when old Hightower , the gro'cry man died . They had the nerve to claim I owed ' em four dollars and fifteen cents when I paid him the very day he passed out . PETER ( Ribbing ) You probably shocked him to death . JEREMIAH Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing to prove it . In writing , Mr. Smallwood . MR . SMALLWOOD The written documents are right here in my bag , Mr. Watkins . p. 19 JEREMIAH Lemme see ' em . MR . SMALLWOOD The custom is to read a will only when everybody concerned is present . MARY Do sit down , Mr. Smallwood . You must be worn out from the trip . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Sitting , taps his brow with his handkerchief ) Thank you . MARY Perhaps you 'd like to wash up a bit . MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm quite all right , thank you . JEREMIAH It 's a good thing you do n't want to wash up  --  nor bathe either . Mrs. Fletcher fixed that . MR . SMALLWOOD How 's that ? JEREMIAH We 're the only village hereabouts without plumbing . The county wanted to put it in and everybody signed up  --  except Mrs. Fletcher . She refused to let them bring in the water main . So  --  on account of her , we still bathe in tin tubes and catch cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance of Mrs. WILSON , Rev. WILSON , followed by Dr. HARRISON . Mrs. WILSON , the youthful wife of the Reverend , is an attractive , uppish woman with a mischievous sense of humor . SHE is slow on the uptake and basically good-natured at heart . Rev. WILSON , much older than his wife , is a weak-looking man despite his husky build and dignified reserve . His apparel , frock coat , stiff white collar , four-way hand tie and dark trousers , is old and worn . HE has the appearance of an earnest , devout man without the drive and confidence to achieve anything - in fact " no fire and brim-stone " is apparent . Dr. HARRISON , dressed in tweeds , is thirtyish - intelligent , observant and deliberate , preferring to listen rather than talk . HE is obviously not a product of the rural South , but has succumbed to its backward influence for professional reasons ) p. 20 MRS . WILSON Well - if it is n't Mary and Peter ! DOCTOR Hello , Mary . Hello , Peter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife 's foot , Watkins ? JEREMIAH Still kicking , Doctor . DOCTOR See that she keeps on wearing that bandage . REV .

MARY ( Cutting in ) This is Mr. Smallwood , Mrs. Fletcher 's lawyer from New York - Mrs. Wilson , Rev. Wilson and Dr. Harrison . ( There is a polite exchange of greetings and handshaking ) DOCTOR Miss Mabel will be right in . She 's amazing . She 's taken this shock very well indeed . MR . SMALLWOOD Yes . I confess it was a shock to me as well . Mrs. Fletcher was in my office only a week ago when we drew her will . MRS . WILSON Will ? What is this all about , Mr. - - er - - MR .

WILSON Did you see our church , Mr. Smallwood ? MR . SMALLWOOD No - I do n't believe I noticed it . MRS . WILSON ( Leads him to window , pointing ) You probably mistook it for a stable . It 's the building with the hunch-back tower and a roof that sags in the middle like a sway-back horse . No one remembers when it was built . Why , the Reverend no longer prays with his eyes closed for fear of the roof caving in . Heaven 's closer to us than our congregations , Mr. Smallwood . MR . SMALLWOOD Closer ? How 's that ? MRS .

He 's here to help you - not rob you . ( Removing her hat , exiting ) It wo n't take me a minute to get you all some food . p. 23 MR . SMALLWOOD ( Stopping her ) Please do n't bother . I ate on the plane . MISS MABEL And the rest of you ? Or would you rather wait until after Mr. Smallwood is finished ? JEREMIAH ( Strongly ) We done et , met , and is all set , ma'am !

Wilson , Pastor of Montrelle Baptist Church , and his wife , Hortense , I bequeath the sum of fifty thousand dollars to fulfill their life 's ambition to build a new church building and establish a nursery school . ( ALL turn and congratulate the Reverend ) REV . WILSON ( With profound reverence ) Lord  --  MRS . WILSON ( Pats the Reverend 's hand reassuringly , then tries to find words to express her own feelings but ca n't and passes the buck to Reverend . SHE rises ) Er - er - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a prayer of gratitude .

SMALLWOOD ( After gaining attention ) Clause F : To my sister , Ann Mabel Carter , I bequeath my half share in the house she lives in at R.F.D. 4 , Montrelle , Georgia with my best regards . ( HE lays down the Will , takes off his spectacles , then glances around the room ) That is the Will of Mrs. Irma Carter-Fletcher signed in my office on the third day of April - witnessed by Joseph Wells and Patricia Langdom . ( There is a silence . The earlier exuberance of PETER and the more subdued excitement of the others has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bequest of MISS MABEL . Nobody quite knows what to do , and the Reverend is the first to voice his feelings ) REV . WILSON Look here - brothers and sisters ! There 's something wrong with that Will ! We could n't accept these gifts  - -  -  ( There is a vigorous and unanimous " Yes " from the OTHERS . MISS MABEL , who has been listening to the reading of the Will with a happy smile , holds up a hand in gentle protest ) . . . when Miss Mabel gets just about nothing ! ( Quick - short jabs of dissension echo from all - with PETER topping ) p. 32 REV . WILSON TOGETHER ( Pounding his fist ) It must be an oversight on Mrs. Fletcher 's part . PETER TOGETHER ( Moving towards Miss Mabel ) Mr. Smallwood says the Will was drawn in haste - - DOCTOR TOGETHERI do n't know what the law says about a thing like this , but I do n't think any of us could be happy  --  MISS MABEL ( Finally arresting the storm ) Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I can explain . It 's good of you all to feel like this . This Will does n't surprise or disappoint me . My sister told me exactly how she was going to leave her money . REV . WILSON But we 're getting everything while you 're - - - MISS MABEL That 's the way she wanted it - - REV . WILSON That 's wrong - - - MISS MABEL That 's the way I wanted it too . This is my Will as much as my sister 's - - - PETER ( Incredulously ) You mean you permitted her - - - MISS MABEL " Persuaded " is the word . We discussed every word of it together and agreed before she went to Mr. Smallwood 's office to write it down  - -  -  p. 33 MR . SMALLWOOD She told me all Miss Mabel wanted was this house . MARY Then it 's you we have to thank for everything . MISS MABEL ( Quickly ) No - No - No ! You must never think that ! It is unfair to my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she leave you more ? MISS MABEL Suppose she had left it all to me - and I died first . Everything would go to the government . DOCTOR ( Resolving ) It does n't make sense - - MISS MABEL ( Delicate , but meaningful ) Does everything have to make sense ? The heart has a logic of its own ! DOCTOR I only meant - - MISS MABEL In her own quiet way - she found out and studied what each one of you were doing . Regardless of what you believed she thought of you , the Will speaks for itself . DOCTOR But none of us could be happy - - MISS MABEL Even if I am happy , Doctor . DOCTOR ( After a pause ) I ca n't believe that . p. 34 MISS MABEL I want little for the few years I have left . And that little is not money . It 's your happiness . PETER With the others , they have things to do with the money . But with Mary and me , the money is for ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still say we owe it all to you . MISS MABEL ( Strongly ) Do n't say that , Peter . You 'll make me very angry and disappointed . REV . WILSON ( In reverence , heavenwise ) Dear Father - - we thank thee  --  MISS MABEL ( Forcefully ) Please ! Say no more about it ! MRS . WILSON ( After a pause in which they ALL accept her conviction as final . Mrs. WILSON points upward ) He was speaking to Him , Miss Mabel .

WILSON Peter  --  we got no time for  --  ( Second thought ) Look , son - the license ! You got to have it . PETER ( Takes out paper ) Sir - we took out this license three years ago - and we 've renewed it every thirty days since then . . . p. 40 MARY We 've got the ring too . REV .

Prices will jump skyhigh . Let 's get going , Hortense . ( They ready to exit ) PETER Wait a minute . This is n't fair  - -  -  REV . WILSON Neither will be the prices - if I wait  - -  -  ( Starts out - stops ) Well - Miss Mabel . I do n't know what to say  - -  -  except thanks . MISS MABEL Now - I 've told you not to thank me !

SMALLWOOD It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILSON ( Rev. WILSON realizes that his job under all circumstances should have been a little restrained . With considerable dexterity contrives to produce a gentle pang of grief ) Ah , yes , poor Mrs. Fletcher . ( Sighs - throws it off , then joyously ) Well - goodbye . ( Mrs. WILSON gestures joyously with raised hands and exits with WILSON ) DOCTOR Miss Mabel - this legacy of your sister 's is going to save lives  - -  -  MISS MABEL Yes - and you must get started on the plans - right away . DOCTOR I most certainly will . ( Turning to Peter ) And you , Peter , your suffering days are not over  --  but at least you know they 're limited . MISS MABEL Let 's have the wedding Sunday afternoon . PETER ( Lightly ) I guess I could die until Sunday . MISS MABEL You 'd even stay over for the wedding , wo n't you , Mr. Smallwood ? MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm afraid it would be impossible . I shall be leaving immediately . p. 42 MISS MABEL But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'm sorry . I 'll be getting a train in less than an hour . ALL ( Converging on him with social graces ) ( Together ) Oh  --  no  --  Do stay  - -  -  We were expecting you to dinner  - -  -  Do stay for the wedding  - -  -  MR . SMALLWOOD ( Topping ) Thank you , but I have an important engagement tomorrow . MARY Well  --  goodbye , Mr. Smallwood . ( Xes , kisses Miss Mabel ) I ca n't tell you what this means to us . MR . SMALLWOOD Good luck to you both . MISS MABEL ( To Smallwood ) Mary thinks people should n't get married until they can afford it , but it seems the only ones fit to marry are the ones who ca n't afford it these days . DOCTOR Do n't forget the Will says you 've got to have children , Mary . MR . SMALLWOOD The Will merely expresses the wish that you use some of the money to that end . PETER ( Quiet , but effectively ) There will be children , sir . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor , I 'll probably open it with the first baby . Goodbye , now  - -  -  ( Exits . PETER embraces MISS MABEL and exits ) MISS MABEL Thank God  --  they 're really going to get married . MR . SMALLWOOD For them the legacy was quite necessary  --  quite so . MISS MABEL That 's putting it mildly . ( Pause ) Now relax - Mr. Smallwood . It 's an hour before there 's a train to Atlanta . Wo n't you have some of my White Mule ? MR . SMALLWOOD That will be very nice . MISS MABEL ( Exiting ) Thank you for the way you helped my sister . MR . SMALLWOOD I was only doing my job , Miss Mabel . MISS MABEL But you did it so nicely . . . I wo n't be but a minute . ( She 's gone ) MR . SMALLWOOD ( Sitting , making the best of it ) Well , Doctor , you must be a very happy man tonight . DOCTOR I 'll be a lot happier in the morning - if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MR . SMALLWOOD Well , personally I sincerely hope you wo n't . I 'd hate to be the tag end of somebody else 's dream . ( MISS MABEL enters with tray containing wine and glasses ) p. 44 DOCTOR ( Pouring up wine ) Miss Mabel - I want you to go upstairs and lie down . This has been an exciting day for all of us - and I want you to get some rest . MISS MABEL Thank you , Doctor . Now have your drink and make yourselves comfortable . Goodbye - and thanks again . MR . SMALLWOOD Thank you . ( SHE pauses in doorway until they both drink . MISS MABEL exits as SMALLWOOD 's face sours ) MR . SMALLWOOD Do you know this stuff ? DOCTOR Yes - it 's pure first class high grain alcohol . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Xes and places glass on table ) You do need a hospital badly . DOCTOR Desperately ! In urgent cases I have to depend on the County Infirmary , six miles away , where we have two beds reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday nights . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Looking at the horizon ) Yes . Poverty itself had to move out . DOCTOR It 's terrible . ( HE laughs - gets himself a drink ) DOCTOR ( Cont 'd ) This gift 's the answer to all my prayers . I just ca n't realize it yet . I dreamed about it too often to believe it 's really true . p. 45 MR . SMALLWOOD ( Returns ) Well , dreams do have a way of coming true sometimes . DOCTOR I drink to my own luck . I am one in a million . ( HE drinks ) MR . SMALLWOOD ( Xing to mantel ) Let 's hope Mrs. Fletcher is realizing all the good she did by dying . DOCTOR Yes , it may sound ungrateful , but she 's certainly of more use dead than she ever was alive . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Looking at photo ) Amazing ! How alike they were . DOCTOR Well , they were twins . Though only a photo would make you think they were really alike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked you . You saw two faces with features exactly the same ; you saw the angel behind one and the devil behind the other . But you must have known the sister well enough to realize that . MR . SMALLWOOD I only met her twice . The second time was only a week ago today when she came to make the Will . She never even told me her sister and she were twins . I was thunderstruck when Miss Mabel walked in that door this afternoon . I thought the dead woman had risen from her grave . I know twins look alike - but when they both have exactly the same birthmark - - p. 46 DOCTOR ( Rising ) Same birthmark ? MR . SMALLWOOD Yes , the mole , or whatever it is , on the left cheek . DOCTOR But only Miss Mabel has a mole on her cheek . MR . SMALLWOOD Her sister had one too . I saw it when she was signing her Will the other day . DOCTOR You imagined it . ( Pointing ) Only one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MR . SMALLWOOD ( Xing to photos and with his spectacles studies them . There is a silence ) You do n't imagine things like that . ( HARRISON looks uneasy and surprised . HE takes an appointment book from his pocket ) DOCTOR When do you say Mrs. Fletcher came to your office to make this Will ? MR . SMALLWOOD It was a week ago today . Last Friday afternoon at three o'clock . ( HARRISON turns the pages of his book . HE looks incredulous ) DOCTOR Are you sure of that ? MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm sure of it . ( Pause ) Why ? What 's troubling you ? p. 47 DOCTOR Only that last Friday afternoon Mrs. Fletcher sent for me because she had a cold . When I arrived at three o'clock she was sitting there - in that armchair . CURTAIN p. 48 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE : REVEREND WILSON 's " study " and meditation room , the next afternoon . The room is no more than a small dilapidated lean-to adjoining the church building . The decaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracks are plugged with rags . The single window along the right and left walls are glassless square holes with rusty blinds . A huge pre-Civil War oil lamp hangs from the ceiling that dips down in the middle . The door in the back leads to the pulpit of the church ; the door in the left wall leads to the outside . In the upstage right corner is an oldfashioned high-top desk with its pigeon holes packed with papers , a telephone , odds and ends . A swivel chair faces the desk . An armchair along the back wall and one left stage ; a small bookcase and pot bellied stove , downstage right ; a table and two cane bottom chairs center ; religious pictures on the wall : a hat rack ; odds and ends on the table , complete the furnishings . Despite the untidiness and poverty , there is a musing and quiet quality in the atmosphere of the room . AT RISE : Rev. WILSON still unable to calm down from the excitement of the previous day , is puffing away on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His actions show a new deliberate appreciation of his smoking - There is a knock and before he can rise and respond , PETER enters carrying a small church model . PETER is dressed in a brand new outfit . The TWO MEN electrify each other , waxing . REV . WILSON Come on in , Peter . p. 49 PETER Howdy , Rev. Wilson . REV . WILSON Son - am I glad to see you ! I 've been walking and talking with God all morning . He must 've got tired of listening to me and told you to come relieve Him . PETER ( Adjusting model on the table ) Mind you now this thing is not to scale - or anything like that  --  REV . WILSON ( Affirmatively ) You mean you did all this when you got home last night . PETER I finished it up - though I started it weeks ago . I could n't sleep last night - for thinking of Mary . I had to do something . REV . WILSON ( Slapping him on the back , then winking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . ( Confidentially ) I took a little toddy - and - my brain started bouncing around in my head like a rubber ball . PETER ( Nervously ) I 'm nervous as a bumble-bee lighting on a hot stove . REV . WILSON Ummmmm hummmmmmmm ! You look like a page out of Sears-Roebuck ! That thing must have cost you a week 's pay . PETER ( Snapping his finger ) On the nose  --  seventeen dollars ! p. 50 REV . WILSON ( With renewed enthusiasm ) I 've been trying to reach Mr. Smallwood on the phone . PETER In New York ? REV . WILSON Yes sir . The estimates on building materials , the land next to the church and the cost of labor , I got them all at the right price . That news will please Mr. Smallwood . PETER So you did bargain before Mrs. Watkins blasted . REV . WILSON She kept her mouth shut - at least up until bedtime . PETER That 's impossible . REV . WILSON The one way to keep Ilahee Watkins from gossiping news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETER Since you are calling - I might as well ask Mr. Smallwood to send me some advance for the wedding tomorrow . He can wire it . ( There is a rap at the outside door . WILSON opens it and SMALLWOOD enters followed by HARRISON . SMALLWOOD is perspiring with embarrassment ; HARRISON is outwardly calm and inwardly tense ) REV . WILSON ( Joyously - clapping his hands ) Awwww , come right in , Mr. Smallwood ! I was just telephoning you . I did n't know you would still be here today . p. 51 MR . SMALLWOOD ( Hating to interrupt the jubilation ) I did n't return to New York . I stayed with Dr. Harrison . REV . WILSON ( Triumphantly ) I got a binder on the land and Peter 's made a wonderful model to go on it . ( Leads SMALLWOOD to the model ) Look ! PETER It 's just a rough-dried idea . Do n't look at it too closely . REV . WILSON He 's done a grand job , has n't he ? I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They only want ten per cent deposit . So if you 'll advance it  - -  -  PETER I suggested a sun-trap - that is two wings facing southeast and southwest for the morning and evening sun . MR . SMALLWOOD Yes , I can see it 's very clever , but I 'm afraid I 've something to tell you that will throw cold water on your enthusiasm . REV . WILSON Why ? What 's the matter ? MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm sorry to say your plans are somewhat premature . REV . WILSON Do n't tell me that there is anything wrong with Mrs. Fletcher 's investments ? MR . SMALLWOOD No . Not that . p. 52 REV . WILSON ( Relieved ) Good . Then perhaps , it 's a case where the lawyer gets the money  --  and I get nothing . ( He laughs ) MR . SMALLWOOD This is no laughing matter , Rev. Wilson . ( Hating to break it , SMALLWOOD looks to HARRISON helpfully and is startled when HARRISON steps away - leaving him to take the lead ) PETER Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all concerned in this . After you and the others left yesterday , certain things came to light . ( Pause - then bluntly ) I 've got to tell you that the Will I read yesterday is invalid . PETER What ? REV . WILSON Did you say invalid ? PETER ( Breathlessly ) You mean that some claimant has appeared  --  ? MR . SMALLWOOD I mean that the Will is a forgery . PETER A forgery ? MR . SMALLWOOD The fact came to light through Dr. Harrison . PETER That 's not true , Doctor ? It could n't be ! DOCTOR It seems that it was Miss Mabel who went to Mr. Smallwoods ' office  --  and made that Will . p. 53 MR . SMALLWOOD And then signed it with her sister 's name . ( PETER 's tension is released as HE bangs the table . This action jolts WILSON into reality ) REV . WILSON ( Storming ) That 's a lie , Mr. Smallwood ! That 's a lie ! For twenty years I 've known Miss Mabel . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SMALLWOOD The fact remains that she impersonated her twin sister  - -  -  REV . WILSON ( Stalking aimlessly , not listening ) I know her to be an honest-God fearing woman . And if you try to deliberately convince me otherwise , you 're barking up the wrong tree . I do n't believe it - MR . SMALLWOOD I do n't think she realized what a serious thing she was going . REV . WILSON I do n't think she did it at all ! MR . SMALLWOOD The lady who came to my office and made this Will had a dark mole on her left cheek . You must have noticed that on Miss Mabel 's cheek . Dr. Harrison tells me that Mrs. Fletcher had no such mole . PETER ( Belittling ) Is that all you have to go on ? MR . SMALLWOOD No , it 's not all . p. 54 PETER Why then would she do such a thing ? MR . SMALLWOOD I 've no doubt she tried to persuade her sister to write a Will like this , but Mrs. Fletcher refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without making a Will  - -   - -   PETER In that case , she would have got the money anyway - and done what she liked with it . MR . SMALLWOOD If she had survived her sister - yes . In fact , she told us the truth up to a certain point . REV . WILSON Miss Mabel always tells the truth . MR . SMALLWOOD Not all the truth , I 'm afraid . REV . WILSON Mr. Smallwood - if you try to make a liar out of Miss Mabel , I 'll have to ask you to leave . AND if you insist on staying  --  then I 'll leave ! MR . SMALLWOOD Please - Rev. Wilson . REV . WILSON Are you going to leave ? PETER You 're imagining the whole thing . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Turning to answer PETER ) Peter --  --  REV . WILSON Then I 'll leave --  --  ( Exits , angrily ) p. 55 PETER Suppose it was Miss Mabel - posing as her sister . Do n't you think she 'd have had the sense to hide a mole right on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoever it was wanted you to see that mole . You did see it . You fell into the trap . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Startled ) What do you mean ? How could that be ? MR . SMALLWOOD ( Cont 'd ) ( Smiling ) Is n't that a little complicated ? Sticking a bit of paint on her face to make me think she was Miss Mabel impersonating Mrs. Fletcher ? PETER It caught you all right . You thought it was Miss Mabel pretending to be her sister when it really was the sister pretending to be her . MR . SMALLWOOD I 've had a little experience in the law , Barlow . I 'm not quite such a fool as to bring a serious charge like this without definite proof . PETER What proof ? MR . SMALLWOOD ( WILSON opens the door , belligerently ) I 've been trying to tell you , but you have n't given me a chance . While the supposed Mrs. Fletcher was in my office making that Will , Dr. Harrison was attending the real Mrs. Fletcher at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same hour . ( WILSON collapses on sofa in despair ) p. 56 DOCTOR We ca n't get away from that , Peter . It 's true . MR . SMALLWOOD Unless , of course , you are going to suggest that while Mrs. Fletcher was impersonating Miss Mabel to fool me - Miss Mabel was down here impersonating her sister to fool Dr. Harrison . ( PETER turns away in disgust and sits in the swivel chair . HE sinks down ) PETER What do we do now ? MR . SMALLWOOD The first thing to do is to avoid anything about this Will becoming generally known . PETER ( Startled ) Generally known ! ( The back of the swivel chair swings backward . PETER almost tumbles to the floor ) MR . SMALLWOOD You have n't told anyone about it , have you ? PETER The whole town knows about it ! MR . SMALLWOOD That 's too bad . PETER ( Jumps up ) Good Lord  --  and I quit my job ! MR . SMALLWOOD Explain the situation . They 'll take you back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Smallwood . You can be fired . But you do n't quit a job -- - and stick around . p. 57 DOCTOR His boss is a cousin of Governor Talmadge . MR . SMALLWOOD It 's a pity you resigned so soon . PETER ( His temper flares ) When a man who 's supposed to be a lawyer tells me what you told me last night , why should n't I believe it ? MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm sorry . I should have told you last night , but I had to  --  to sleep over it . PETER And I 'll never sleep again . MR . SMALLWOOD You must realize how I felt . I was astounded . I needed a little time . PETER Here I am expecting fifteen thousand dollars and do n't have fifteen cents . Mary and I were going to get married right after church service tomorrow . MR . SMALLWOOD Too bad you could n't wait at least until you had the money  --  after waiting three years . PETER Nature ca n't wear short britches forever , Mr. Smallwood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wrote Tuskegee for an entrance application - instead of going on with my correspondence course . I was going to study and learn every modern cheap way of building homes for poor people . ( Pause ) You see , I 'm the self appointed wonder-boy who was going to teach these poor dopes how to literally scratch homes out of the belly of the earth -- -from cutting and treating timber to stewing their own bricks out of mud ! You cracked my golden egg , Mr. Smallwood , and it 's pretty rotten ! ( BOTH are balanced in silence . PETER sighs emptily ) So where do we go from here ? What 's to be done ? p. 58 MR . SMALLWOOD There 's only one thing to be done . ( WILSON enters . SMALLWOOD 's speech causes him to pause in the doorway ) The whole matter must go to the police . REV . WILSON ( " Police " lowers his morale ) I sent for - Mr. Watkins . MR . SMALLWOOD That 's good . He should be able to throw some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smallwood  --  you said as far as you know , Mrs. Fletcher died without making a Will ? MR . SMALLWOOD As far as I know , yes . PETER Then Miss Mabel would get everything ? ( SMALLWOOD nods ) And she could make a Will of her own , leaving the money exactly as she wants to ? MR . SMALLWOOD She could . PETER ( Relieved ) Then I do n't see anything very serious has happened after all . MR . SMALLWOOD What about the forgery ? PETER ( Efficiently ) If you forged a check or something to cheat somebody out of money that rightfully belongs to them , then of course it 's serious . But Miss Mabel did n't do it for her personal benefit  --  and she has n't cheated anybody except herself . p. 59 MR . SMALLWOOD That 's not the point . PETER You want to get her into trouble ? MR . SMALLWOOD That 's the last thing I want to do . PETER Then tear up the damn Will and forget about it . She simply gave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact remains that forgery was committed , and that we are all fully aware of it . You may not feel morally obligated to do anything about it , but I 'm a professional man with a standard of professional conduct to maintain . PETER But who 's to know ? You do n't suppose any of us are going to say anything ? MR . SMALLWOOD The two clerks in my office witnessed that signature . What do you think they would do when they found out - that I had destroyed what they believe to be a legal Will ? PETER What ? What can they do ? MR . SMALLWOOD If they did n't report it to the police , they would be incriminated with me as co-conspirators . PETER ( Giving up ) That means Miss Mabel will be arrested ? MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm afraid so . p. 60 REV . WILSON ( Interjecting ) If there ever was a person who could advertise heaven , it 's Miss Mabel . PETER ( Ignoring Wilson ) And there 'll be a trial ? MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd be trying a saint . PETER And we 'd be used as witnesses against her ? REV . WILSON Witnesses against the good ! MR . SMALLWOOD ( Still ignoring WILSON ) The doctor , certainly . Possibly others . I ca n't say . PETER So one by one - we 'll march up to the witness stand and give testimony that 'll send Miss Mabel to jail . If the whole town came along and stoned us we 'd deserve it . MR . SMALLWOOD No reasonable person would see it like that . We should get a good lawyer to defend her . I guarantee there wo n't be a person in court who 'll feel anything but sympathy and understanding for her . PETER This is Georgia , Mr. Smallwood . MR . SMALLWOOD If you can think of any other way , then I 'd be a very happy man . REV . WILSON ( With accusation ) Pontius Pilate ! ! ! p. 61 DOCTOR You say I shall be called as a witness for the prosecution ? MR . SMALLWOOD Naturally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mole and also of your seeing Mrs. Fletcher here at the very hour the Will was signed in New York . DOCTOR ( Consulting his date book ) In regard to the latter point , I see now that I was mistaken . It was a day earlier that I visited Mrs. Fletcher . Not the third but the second . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Staring at him ) You 're not serious ? DOCTOR ( Returning the stare ) Very serious . PETER Good for you , doctor ! MR . SMALLWOOD Will you be willing to swear that you attended Mrs. Fletcher on the second instead of the third ? DOCTOR QUITE willing . MR . SMALLWOOD You realize you 'll be committing perjury ? DOCTOR Is it perjury to correct a mistake ! MR . SMALLWOOD What if the prosecutor suggests that this change of heart has something to do with your inheriting thirty thousand dollars under the terms of the forged Will ? p. 62 DOCTOR It will be up to the prosecutor to prove that the Will is forged ! MR . SMALLWOOD And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say it did n't exist . DOCTOR That will not be too difficult . I 've been thinking what a damned fool I was to say what I did . MR . SMALLWOOD A man is n't necessarily a fool because he tells the truth . DOCTOR He may not be when he tells it once . But he 's the damndest fool when he tells it twice . MR . SMALLWOOD And you are asking me to probate a Will that I know to be forged . PETER We 're challenging you to prove that it is forged . MR . SMALLWOOD Perhaps I shall accept that challenge . PETER You 're damned set on sending Miss Mabel to jail ! DOCTOR Surely you do n't wish to brand her a common criminal ? MR . SMALLWOOD What I wish or do n't wish is n't the question . I believe a man may use his judgment in any matter that does n't conflict with his profession . In professional affairs it must be the truth and nothing but the truth . PETER I 'd rather have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 63 MR . SMALLWOOD ( Strongly ) Doctor , suppose this case were one in which you were asked to conceal a vital bit of medical evidence ? Your conscience might come to life . DOCTOR ( Unruffled ) I 'm sorry you would n't have a leg to stand on . MR . SMALLWOOD Obviously - you ca n't have a case without evidence . PETER Then it 's a case of your word against the doctor 's . MR . SMALLWOOD It 's the question of the truth against a lie . PETER Then you 'd have only the mole . The mole - The mole --  !  - -  to help you ! And for all you know it was n't a mole . It might have been anything  --  it could have been a horse fly . REV . WILSON Why not say it was a horse fly ? DOCTOR What are you going to do , Mr. Smallwood ? MR . SMALLWOOD You leave me nothing to do . PETER ( Elated ) You mean that ? MR . SMALLWOOD What can I do ? You leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you glad ? MR . SMALLWOOD Speaking as a lawyer , I am gravely disturbed . ( To Harrison ) You tell me definitely - in the presence of these two gentlemen as witnesses that I was completely mistaken in thinking you said a word to me about this matter last night ? DOCTOR Absolutely . After the Will was read , I simply said good night to you and went home . MR . SMALLWOOD You would swear to that ? DOCTOR Anywhere . MR . SMALLWOOD Then I think I may honestly say that my conscience is clear . PETER Now you 're talking sense , Mr. Smallwood . MR . SMALLWOOD My conscience as a man . My conscience as a lawyer will never be at peace . PETER Who cares about that ? MR . SMALLWOOD The legal profession cares . If this forgery ever comes to light and my knowledge of it is discovered , then I 'd be disbarred and ruined . As a human being , I must admit I 'm very happy that Dr. Harrison has robbed me of my evidence . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way . I also agree that if this matter were proceeded with , then a foolish , but a very generous and kind hearted woman would go through an ordeal that might easily kill her . I can only ask you to stand by every word you have said here today . p. 65 PETER You 've got my word on that . DOCTOR And mine . MR . SMALLWOOD I did n't hear Rev. Wilson say : " Amen " . REV . WILSON I 'm afraid I did n't follow everything you 've been saying , because I do n't have a legal mind . But nothing will ever make me believe that Miss Mabel ever in her life done anything dishonorable . I 'd say that , if necessary , before God Almighty , Himself ! MR . SMALLWOOD Yes  - -  -  ( HE is not satisfied ) But would you say that to a judge ? REV . WILSON Before the highest one in the land ! MR . SMALLWOOD And you would say that you know nothing of the matter ? REV . WILSON I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own today and send it to us , it would read like the one you read yesterday . I feel that these wonderful gifts were worthy of God Himself , and I need more than I heard today to make me believe that God commits forgeries . MR . SMALLWOOD Very well , that 's that . ( Rises ) Then we must just forget that all this ever happened . We must take our minds back to the moment I finished reading the Will last night and pick up the threads from there . p. 66 PETER ( Picking up model ) And we can go ahead with all this ? MR . SMALLWOOD As far as I 'm concerned , you can go ahead with everything . REV . WILSON ( With reverence ) Let us thank God that in his wisdom he 's reached down his hand and shielded from the devices of ignorant men --  ( Eyeing SMALLWOOD ) our blessed and saintly sister . Let us pray -- - ( BOTH WILSON and PETER kneel down on one knee . SMALLWOOD and HARRISON bow their heads ) MISS MABEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and misconstruing what she does see ) Oh - you 're having prayer meeting . I 'm sorry . I wo n't disturb you . ( About to exit ) REV . WILSON ( They ALL become alert ) No . Come in , please , Miss Mabel - we 've  --  we 've finished . MISS MABEL Why , Mr. Smallwood , you did stay over ! That 's wonderful . REV . WILSON Miss Mabel - you see - - MISS MABEL You could n't guess where I 've been . ( Pause ) I 've been to the Sheriff 's office  - -  -  ( They ALL converge on her , sympathetically ) p. 67 REV . WILSON You did n't have to do that  - -  -  PETER Everything 's been cleared up  - -  -  DOCTOR You went to the police ! MISS MABEL ( Topping - amused ) I went to the Sheriff 's office - and sold him two tickets for the church bazaar . ( You can hear the suspicion drop ) Was n't that sweet of him . It 's the first time he ever bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the model from PETER ) Why Peter ! It 's wonderful . I saw Mary this morning and she told me all about it . You did it last night because you were so upset about the marriage . ( PETER nods ) That 's the time to do work when you 're upset . That 's why you were having a prayer meeting . Rev. Wilson preaches his best sermons when he 's upset . Thank goodness , he 's upset most of the time . ( SHE pauses - then slowly knits the thinking of the group together ) You 've found out ? You 've found out what I had to do ? MR . SMALLWOOD ( Gently ) Yes . MISS MABEL Good Lord ! I was hoping you 'd never find out ! ( Sits ) But then , I 'm not smart at things like that . I 've never done anything like it in my life . ( Pauses ) Believe me when I tell you I done it because I felt that it was the right thing to do ? p. 68 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Mabel . MR . SMALLWOOD We know you did n't realize what a serious thing it was . MISS MABEL But I did . I knew it was a terrible thing . REV . WILSON God moves in a mysterious way . MISS MABEL It 's nice of you to say that . ( Pause ) Then you all forgive me . DOCTOR Of course . PETER Certainly we do . MISS MABEL Then whatever happens , I 'll be happy . I guess I 'd better leave you together . ( SHE goes toward the door ) REV . WILSON You do n't have to go . MISS MABEL I do n't want to be here while you decide what to do . PETER But , Miss Mabel , we have - - - MISS MABEL ( Gently breaking in ) But whatever you decide , I do want you to know one thing . She did n't suffer any pain . I swear I wouldn't 've done it - if I thought for one minute she would suffer . But Watkins told me there would be no pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closes the door ) CURTAIN@@ SCENE : The same as the previous scene . It is an hour later . Night has fallen and the ancient lamp dimly lights the room . Mrs. WILSON and MARY are now there , so that all concerned are present except MISS MABEL and WATKINS . AT RISE : Mrs. WILSON is sitting in the swivel chair at the desk . SMALLWOOD , sitting center looking very tired , has apparently just finished explaining things to her . MARY is sitting in the chair left with PETER straddling the arm of her chair . WILSON and HARRISON are down right - listening . DOCTOR ( Conclusively )  - -   - -  And there were no marks of violence  - -  - And from what Miss Mabel said about no pain , the evidence  - -  -  points to poison . MR . SMALLWOOD And that 's all we know , Mrs. Wilson . MRS . WILSON You say Miss Mabel got rid of her sister - is that it ? And then made that Will herself ? MR . SMALLWOOD ( At the end of his tether ) No . She made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . WILSON Well , that 's six of one and a half-dozen of the other . It does n't matter which one you did first - you said ? MR . SMALLWOOD Mrs. Wilson . You 're taking this matter in the most --  --  You seem amused by it . p. 70 MRS . WILSON How could anybody help it ? It 's the funniest thing I 've ever heard in my life . Miss Mabel going around poisoning people ! ( At SMALLWOOD ) WHICH FIRST ? ( SMALLWOOD is speechless with exasperation ) MRS . WILSON ( Cont 'd ) In a store , if I pick up an orange - and walk away , I am a thief . If I put down my nickel and walk away , I am a customer . . . . . She is the sweetest soul I 've ever known . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Spelling it out ) We 've definite knowledge that she wrote that Will and signed her sister 's name to it ! MRS . WILSON Well --  Whose name would she sign to it ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you do in New York , Mr. Smallwood , but down here we mind our own business . MR . SMALLWOOD She also told us , in this very room , that with the help of Watkins , she brought about her sister 's death - with poison . MRS . WILSON ( Amused ) She said that Jeremiah Watkins helped her ? MR . SMALLWOOD That is what she told us . MRS . WILSON Well , does n't that prove she was having fun with you ? Why , Mr. Watkins passes around the collection plate in church . ( SHE looks around the room with a laugh ) Imagine Watkins and Miss Mabel creeping around with a bottle of poison ! Why do n't you tell me that my husband has killed the Governor of Georgia with a sling-shot ? p. 71 MR . SMALLWOOD ( To MARY ) I 'm sorry we 've had to worry you , Miss Rowland . ( MARY is not quite so detached from reality as Mrs. WILSON , but SHE refuses to accept the story ) MARY That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , because I can tell you what I think too . Whatever Miss Mabel said , I 'm sure you got the wrong meaning of it . ( SMALLWOOD glances at MARY : HE is scarcely listening . HE then pursues the course of his argument with Mrs. WILSON , determined to bring her to stark realities ) MR . SMALLWOOD ( To Mrs. WILSON ) The responsibility is thrown on you - on all of us . It ca n't be evaded . I certainly would have preferred to have kept you out of this , Mrs. Wilson , but your husband felt that  --  REV . WILSON ( Breaking in ) There 're no secrets between me and my wife . If she did n't hear it from you , I 'd have told her myself . MRS . WILSON ( Surprised - for the first time a little uneasy ) But you do n't believe a word of it . How could you ? You 've never thought evil of anybody in your life ! REV . WILSON ( Unhappily ) I 'm sure there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are certain moments when - in spite of our feelings , we have to face facts . MRS . WILSON ( With despair ) You have n't a fact to bless yourself with . MR . SMALLWOOD Suppose someone told you that a little child was starving on your doorstep - Would you refuse to go and look just because you thought it ridiculous ? MRS . WILSON ( Losing her temper ) Mr. Smallwood , I know darn well that there is n't a child on my doorstep , and I 'd just be a fool if I went to look - just because you say there is ! REV . WILSON Hortense  - -  -  MRS . WILSON What does he take me for ? There 're no children on our doorstep . ( To SMALLWOOD ) Suppose I told you that a balloon of cannibals had come down in your back yard , would you run for your life because you 're scared they 'd eat you up ? MR . SMALLWOOD You do n't understand me  --  MRS . WILSON I understand you a good deal better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to earn your pay , but when you start saying Miss Mabel poisoned her sister and then try to scare me about a child on my doorstep - somebody is tetched  - -  -  p. 73 MR . SMALLWOOD ( Fuming ) I did n't say there was a child on the doorstep ! MRS . WILSON Very well , then ! As long as you take it back . ( Turns from him , as if that settles it ) Now , we 'll all have a nice cup of coffee and forget about it . You 'll all feel better after a cup of coffee . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Sighing ) I 'm afraid a cup of coffee wo n't help , Mrs. Wilson . MRS . WILSON How do you know ? You have n't had it yet . And please do n't say Miss Mabel poisoned her sister , again , because it ai n't nice . ( SHE goes out in a huff . There is a short , uneasy silence ) MARY ( Emphatically ) I 'm sure you got the wrong meaning of whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain while she was here ? ( PETER makes a hopeless gesture ) DOCTOR By the time we came to , she was gone . MARY Well , why not go to her now . PETER ( Shaking his head ) You did n't hear the way she said it , Mary . MARY You think she really did it ? p. 74 PETER ( Quickly ) I do n't say that at all . Old man Watkins may have done it . MARY Then why not send for him ? DOCTOR We have . PETER Quite some time ago . MARY I 'll just walk down to his place and bring him back . ( SHE 's gone out ) MR . SMALLWOOD ( Thoughtfully ) How long has Watkins worked for Miss Mabel ? PETER Over twenty-five years . MR . SMALLWOOD Does he help in the house at all ? DOCTOR Oh , he does all sorts of odd jobs . REV . WILSON He 's very handy . He can do anything . He 'll work the movie machine at the church tonight . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will  --  PETER Then of course he would know about the five thousand dol --  MR . SMALLWOOD And that would certainly give him a motive for wishing to  --  ( PETER nods ) REV . WILSON Let 's not forget that we 're talking about a man who has never been suspected of any crime . p. 75 MR . SMALLWOOD What were his relations with Mrs. Fletcher ? Friendly ? PETER ( Without thinking ) He hated her like poison . ( THEY look at each other suddenly ) MR . SMALLWOOD You know that ? PETER He - told me  --  himself  --  He said if it were up to him , he 'd fling her corpse on a bonfire and use her ashes for fertilizer . MR . SMALLWOOD Watkins said that ? DOCTOR Oh - he was just talking . MR . SMALLWOOD Naturally - that sort of thing means nothing . ( A short silence ) Watkins would certainly have reasons for wanting Mrs. Fletcher out of the way . The night Mrs. Fletcher died , what time was it when Watkins came for you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say ? DOCTOR He said Miss Mabel wanted me right away . Mrs. Fletcher had a pain and went to bed about 10:30 . Miss Mabel thought she had indigestion and applied a hot water bag , then went to bed herself . An hour later , she returned to her sister 's room and found her asleep . There was something strange in her sleep . Miss Mabel became panicky and sent for me. p. 76 MR . SMALLWOOD You found Mrs. Fletcher dead . Did you tell Watkins . DOCTOR Yes , as soon as I came downstairs from her room . MR . SMALLWOOD What did he say ? DOCTOR I said Mrs. Fletcher is dead . He said : " Thank  --  " then he stopped . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Capitalizing ) What further evidence do we need , gentlemen ! DOCTOR I fail to see that that proves anything . MR . SMALLWOOD Was n't it somewhat convenient for Watkins to be on hand when you were needed ? DOCTOR The man lives only a quarter of a mile from Miss Mabel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night of  --  MR . SMALLWOOD ( Condemningly ) In the kitchen ? DOCTOR Watkins putters around the farm any hour of the day or night . Everyone knows he 's somewhat eccentric  --  PETER He tried to kill a man once  --  MR . SMALLWOOD ( Startled ) Kill a man ? Who ? When ? MARY ( Entering ) Mr. Watkins is on the way here . p. 77 MR . SMALLWOOD ( Turning , quickly ) Oh  --  he is ? MARY He was over at the store  --  MR . SMALLWOOD You did n't say anything ? MARY I thought it best to leave that to you . ( MARY opens the door and waits . WILSON Xs D.R. ) MR . SMALLWOOD ( Close to PETER , pressing on ) He tried to kill a man - PETER I never did know the story . Something to do with Ilahee . JEREMIAH ( Enters . HE is dressed in his work clothes - and - is surprised to see all the people ) Howdy , folks . Evening , Reverend  --  sorry I 'm late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour ago . JEREMIAH I was getting some supplies - bulbs for the movies tonight . REV . WILSON ( Vaguely ) The movies ? JEREMIAH Sure for the Bazaar at church . REV . WILSON Er - yes , Brother Watkins - that 's right . But I asked you to come here for something else  --  MR . SMALLWOOD Would you sit down , Mr. Watkins ? p. 78 JEREMIAH Not much time . I got to get washed and cleaned up for  --  MR . SMALLWOOD I had to call another meeting , Mr. Watkins . JEREMIAH Oh ? Why ? What 's happened ? MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm afraid that I 've got some serious news . The Will that I read yesterday evening at Miss Mabel 's house was not in order . It was a forgery . JEREMIAH ( After a pause , HE sits ) How do you mean a forgery ? MR . SMALLWOOD It was n't made by the late Mrs. Fletcher . JEREMIAH Who made it then ? MR . SMALLWOOD Miss Mabel . Posing as her sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what we 're trying to understand . We 're hoping you may be able to help us . JEREMIAH Help you ? MR . SMALLWOOD You 've been with Miss Mabel for a long time . JEREMIAH That 's right ! MR . SMALLWOOD Knowing her so well , you may have some idea as to why she did it ? JEREMIAH Did what ? p. 79 MR . SMALLWOOD She came to my office saying that she was her sister and wrote a Will in her sister 's name . JEREMIAH Well , maybe she did it to save her sister trouble . She 's always doing things like that . She even sent the Doctor around when my old woman swallowed a false tooth the other day . MR . SMALLWOOD I do n't think you quite understand . ( HE speaks slowly and distinctly ) She made a Will disposing of her sister 's property and signed her sister 's name to it . That means she committed forgery ; and forgery is a serious crime . We hoped you might have had some clue to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just her tenant farmer ! MR . SMALLWOOD She never discussed things with you ? JEREMIAH Nothing like that , she did n't . ( There is a pause . SMALLWOOD sits back reflectively ) MR . SMALLWOOD That 's a pity . We 're in great difficulty - groping in the dark . JEREMIAH Why do n't you ask her ? MR . SMALLWOOD We will , of course . In the meantime , I 'm afraid you 'll have to forget all about the five thousand dollars . JEREMIAH ( Sitting up ) What ! p. 80 MR . SMALLWOOD A forged Will is n't worth the paper it 's written on . ( WATKINS stares in amazement ) You 're not the only one affected , Mr. Watkins . Everyone here believed they would get substantial legacies and they 've all been disappointed . JEREMIAH Are you telling me you ai n't goin ' to give me my five thous -- - MR . SMALLWOOD I ca n't give it to you . It 's not in my power . JEREMIAH In a pig 's eye ! I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising , kicking over his chair . There is a stir ) MR . SMALLWOOD Mr. Watkins  --  please  - -  -  JEREMIAH Do n't " Mr. Watkins " me ! ( Shaking his finger in his face ) You 've juggled them papers to get the money yourself . I know you lawyers . REV . WILSON ( Restraining him ) Brother Watkins  --  JEREMIAH She gave me five thousand dollars . It 's due me and I ai n't goin ' out of this room till I get it ! MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm telling you that I read the Will under a misapprehension ! JEREMIAH ( Tossing his hat aside ) I do n't care what you read it under . She gave me five thous --  p. 81 MR . SMALLWOOD She did n't give you five thousand ! She did n't write that Will ! JEREMIAH I do n't give a damn who wrote it ! You told me in front of all these people that there was five thousand due me and I 'll bring them to witness what you said . MR . SMALLWOOD Well - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no good my explaining any further . These ladies and gentlemen understand and they 've accepted the position . JEREMIAH If they want to be cheated , that 's their affair . No stuck-up fish from Harlem is goin ' to get fat off my money . MR . SMALLWOOD I 've told you that I did n't know then that the Will was false . JEREMIAH ( Turning away ) Well - it 's no use bringing that up now , because I 've spent it . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Aghast ) You 've spent it ! JEREMIAH ( Pulling out and exposing receipt ) Of course I have . I took your word and went right round to Joe Potter 's and bought his farm for thirty-five hundred dollars . He wanted something on account , and I gave him forty-seven dollars  --  twenty years of savings . MR . SMALLWOOD I do n't doubt that you can get it back . p. 82 JEREMIAH I do n't want it back . I want that farm and I 'm goin ' to get it . Besides - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mule  --  MR . SMALLWOOD Then you 'd better cancel it . JEREMIAH Cancel that mule ! No sonova gun 's goin ' to make me cancel that mule ! ( To the room ) Are you going to let this crooked Yankee cheat you out of what 's due you ? PETER He 's trying to help you . Not cheat you . JEREMIAH ( Disappointed in PETER 's gullibility ) Helping me not to get it . And a helluva one you are - taking sides with this  --  ( Groping for words ) PETER He has n't got your money ! JEREMIAH Well , who has ? Mebbie you 've got it . Since you 're so anxious to throw in your two cents worth . That old gal had a bunch of dough . Then where is it . She was mean - but not mean enough to rise from her grave and take back the money . MR . SMALLWOOD The money is safe , but no one can tell at present who it belongs to . JEREMIAH Belongs to ! What about Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MR . SMALLWOOD Yes . And if Mrs. Fletcher had died normally without a Will , Miss Mabel would inherit everything  --  p. 83 JEREMIAH ( Solving it ) Well - that 's all right then . She 'll take care of me . I do n't need Mrs. Fletcher . You can go on back to New York . Get on back to Harlem , Mr. Smallwood , where you belong . MR . SMALLWOOD I said that normally she would inherit . We 've reason to believe things are not normal . We 've reason to believe that Mrs. Fletcher was murdered . ( THEY all glance instinctively ) JEREMIAH ( Turning ) Murdered ? Who done it ? ( Silence ) WHAT you all looking at me like that ? Are you saying I done it ? MR . SMALLWOOD I did n't say that ! MR . SMALLWOOD I did n't say that ! JEREMIAH You do n't have to say it . I can smell it . MR . SMALLWOOD How did you happen to tell Miss Mabel that the poison would cause no pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MR . SMALLWOOD Never mind who said it . JEREMIAH That 's a lie ! MR . SMALLWOOD That you were certain it would cause no pain . p. 84 JEREMIAH That 's a rotten , stinking , mildewed lie ! MR . SMALLWOOD Even if Miss Mabel herself told us what you said in her confession ? JEREMIAH I 'll tell the sheriff what a cheat you are - and you wo n't need no plane - ' cause he 'll send you flying back to Harlem on the end of his foot ! MR . SMALLWOOD We may have to have the sheriff on you , Mr. Watkins . You ca n't deny what Miss Mabel said . JEREMIAH I do n't know what Miss Mabel said . I deny everything your hog-head brain has hatched up to steal our money . MR . SMALLWOOD Do you deny that Mrs. Fletcher was murdered ? JEREMIAH ( Bitterly ) If she was , then good riddance to her ! She made life miserable for me , and Miss Mabel too , and murder was a damn sight too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I done . MR . SMALLWOOD So - you earned five thousand dollars for what you done ? JEREMIAH ( Wildly ) That 's right ! ( Leaps at SMALLWOOD , restrained by the OTHERS ) Twist up what I say  --  you sonovagun  --  ( Bedlam reigns - WATKINS can hardly be held back ) p. 85 MR . SMALLWOOD ( Pressing on ) So you did something to earn that five thousand dollars ! JEREMIAH I stuck by Miss Mabel , that 's what I did ! And I 'll do plenty more if I have to ! MR . SMALLWOOD You murdered Mrs. Fletcher ! ! ! JEREMIAH ( Still restrained , he leaps up furiously ) That 's a damn lie ! I ai n't goin ' to stand for them lies  --  not another minute  --  I ai n't  --  MR . SMALLWOOD You tried to kill a man once before  --  JEREMIAH Why you  --  you sonova  - -  -  ( Choking with rage , HE plunges into SMALLWOOD - attempting to beat him . SMALLWOOD , to the surprise of everyone , successfully sidesteps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having missed his target , crashes into the desk . HE rises , securely feeling that he has triumphed ) And if you call me a murderer again , I 'll knock your Gawddamn block off ! ( HE goes out and slams the door ) MR . SMALLWOOD ( Adjusting his clothes ) Get the police . PETER ( Xing to phone ) Sure - he did it alright . I 'll phone the sheriff . p. 86 MARY ( To PETER ) How can you say he is a murderer when - when you do n't know Mrs. Fletcher was murdered ! ( Yanking phone from PETER ) You put that phone down ! ( Bangs the receiver down ) MR . SMALLWOOD ( Going to phone ) Very well - I 'll phone myself . ( Takes up receiver - juggling ) MARY ( Appealing to WILSON ) Do n't let him do it - Rev. Wilson . Mr. Watkins has n't killed anybody . REV . WILSON ( Regretfully ) Mary - this is a matter for the law to decide now  --  MARY ( While SMALLWOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh - I 'm ashamed of all of you ! You 're deliberately taking advantage of that poor old man . MRS . WILSON ( Entering ) What have you been doing to Mr. Watkins ? I 've never seen him in such a terrible temper in all my life . I reminded him about working the projector tonight , he shouted something about : " I knew what I could do with it . " REV . WILSON We 've got to cancel the Bazaar . MRS . WILSON How can we ! People coming from all around . p. 87 REV . WILSON ( Flaring impatiently ) Well , send them back ! ( Distressfully ) I 'm sorry  --  MR . SMALLWOOD ( Angry at the phone ) What 's wrong with this phone ? Watkins 'll get away - if we are n't careful  - -  -  PETER ( Listening in receiver ) These party lines ! It 's been busy practically all day  --  MR . SMALLWOOD Peter - will you show me where I 'll find the sheriff  --  ? PETER Sure thing  --  let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do whatever you like . But leave Peter out of this . MR . SMALLWOOD Peter is doing what any law-abiding citizen would do . PETER Mary , you do n't believe he did it , but he did !

Our engagement is off ! ( Xing from him ) p. 88 PETER Mary - for Pete 's sake ! ( Going to MARY ) It 's you who 's being unreasonable . Watkins could n't stand Mrs. Fletcher any longer . Miss Mabel promised him five thousand dollars when her sister died  --  MR . SMALLWOOD Dr. Harrison - where will I find the sheriff ? PETER Wait a minute , Mr. Smallwood . ( To Mary ) Old man Watkins planted the idea of the forged Will in Miss Mabel 's head . Once he knew that the Will was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the time to blow her to Kingdom Come . " DOCTOR I 'm afraid Peter is right . DOCTOR ( Talking to all ) It 's this way . When Miss Mabel said she would n't have done it , she meant the murder itself . She meant she would n't conceal her knowledge of it , if her sister suffered no pain . PETER ( Topping the thought ) Watkins is the actual murderer . Miss Mabel was simply forced on by Watkins . MARY Is that the way all of you feel ? ALL Yes  --  Yes  --  Absolutely , yes  --  MRS . WILSON ( Confusingly ) Yes , I guess . David , you said , " yes " , did n't you ? ( WILSON nods , then Mrs. WILSON with assurance ) Yes ! p. 89 MARY But there 's no proof . MR . SMALLWOOD Proof ? What more do you want . Watkins hated Mrs. Fletcher . He was puttering around in the kitchen when she died  --  He killed her because she reduced his share in the crops . Besides he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY That ! He only pushed him into the river . PETER But the man could n't swim , Mary . MARY The river was n't deep ! ( SMALLWOOD , completely exasperated with MARY , Xs right ) REV . WILSON The phone 's free now . REV . WILSON ( Cont 'd ) ( Goes to phone , juggling it . SMALLWOOD and HARRISON clutter at the phone . MARY Xs left , thinking , while Mrs. WILSON joins her . PETER stands center , indecisive ) Hello , Miss Agnes - give me the sheriff 's office , please .  --  ( Pause ) He 's not ? ( Pause ) Have you any idea where he is ?

MISS MABEL ( Bursting into the room , breathless from haste ) What is this ? What kind of joke is this ? Brother Watkins tells me you said he murdered my sister . How could you say a thing like that ? ( THEY all stare at her , then each other . WILSON unconsciously replaces the receiver ) MR . SMALLWOOD But , Miss Mabel - you told us yourself a little while ago . MISS MABEL ( Astonished ) I told you ? I told you Brother Watkins murdered my sister ? MR . SMALLWOOD ( Coming to her - quietly ) You told us that Mr. Watkins said that your sister " would suffer no pain . " ( There is a moment of silence . MISS MABEL stares at SMALLWOOD in blank bewilderment unable to grasp his meaning . Then suddenly SHE understands ) MISS MABEL Good heavens , man ! I did n't mean that at all ! Whatever gave you that idea ? MR . SMALLWOOD ( Hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MISS MABEL Not one bit ! It 's ridiculous ! It 's - it 's - the worst thing I ever heard in my life . If you did think I meant that , then your thinking is a mess . ( There is a sudden relaxation and incredulous relief throughout the room . MISS MABEL sits at the table . The phone rings . HARRISON , who is near the phone , answers it ) DOCTOR ( On phone ) Hello  --  ( Pause )  --  just one minute , please  --  ( To WILSON ) Miss Agnes has the sheriff on the phone . REV . WILSON ( Gulping ) It is  --  ? ( SMALLWOOD gestures to WILSON to answer , but WILSON is frozen ) You got me into this , Mr. Smallwood . Now , you get me out . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Taking phone - thinking up what to say , then ) Sheriff - this is Henry Smallwood , a friend of Rev. Wilson . He and I are trying to determine how many Negroes are in the county . Would you happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burring sound from the other end - that causes SMALLWOOD to grimace ) REV . WILSON What did he say ? MR . SMALLWOOD Too many - MRS . WILSON ( Damning Smallwood ) He 's lying , Miss Mabel . They 's been phoning to get Mr. Watkins arrested . p. 92 MISS MABEL Are you all crazy ! MRS . WILSON ( To Smallwood ) You should apologize to Miss Mabel . MR . SMALLWOOD Miss Mabel , accept my deepest apologies . But you must admit that the way you spoke to us - your words entirely misled and confused us  --  MISS MABEL ( Perplexed ) But why ? You said you knew everything ? You told me so this afternoon . MR . SMALLWOOD We knew that it was not your sister who came to my office and made that Will . We were right about that , I think . MISS MABEL Yes , of course you were right . ( Pause ) MR . SMALLWOOD Dr. Harrison called at your home to see your sister that same afternoon . MISS MABEL Ai n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . ( Pauses to think - sadly ) She hardly ever needed a doctor . It was just bad luck . ( SHE thinks again ) If Dr. Harrison had n't seen my sister that afternoon , would you still have found out ? MR . SMALLWOOD I do n't know . There was nothing definite . p. 93 DOCTOR I just saw the date in my book and I spoke without thinking . MR . SMALLWOOD Then I came and told the others about it . MISS MABEL It 's thrown the fat in the fire for all of you . I am sorry . WILSON , PETER , MRS . WILSON ( All at once ) Do n't worry about us . No , you must n't think about that . No , Miss Mabel please . But you do understand , I done what I did because I thought it was right . MR . SMALLWOOD We all realize you had no personal gain in mind . We know that if your sister had made no previous Will . . . MISS MABEL Oh , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you positive ? MISS MABEL Oh yes ! She told me lots of times . It would have been wrong to do one for her if she had . MRS . WILSON ( To SMALLWOOD , triumphantly ) You see ! MR . SMALLWOOD ( After a strange look at Miss Mabel ) In the normal way you would have inherited all her property , free to dispose of it . Did you know that ? MISS MABEL Yes . But it was her money . I wanted it to look like the big generous thing was her doing . p. 94 MR . SMALLWOOD You realize that was forgery ? MISS MABEL I do . MRS . WILSON Miss Mabel ! MISS MABEL I know I should n't have done it . MR . SMALLWOOD And you know that it 's everyone 's duty on finding out that a crime has been committed to tell the police ? MISS MABEL That 's why I hoped you would n't know . REV . WILSON ( Sympathetically ) We 're very sorry you felt you had to go so far . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As nobody but you were likely to suffer by what you did that afternoon , Dr. Harrison withdrew what he told us about attending your sister . He said that he would deny it , so there was no evidence , and no case to take to the police . MISS MABEL That was good of you , Doctor . You did something wrong to help me . I 'm very grateful . DOCTOR ( Deprecatingly ) I felt I had to . MISS MABEL ( Rising to leave . Pauses ) And what about the other thing ? ( SMALLWOOD hesitates and glances at the DOCTOR . The others are startled ) p. 95 MR . SMALLWOOD By the other thing , you mean  --  ( SHE nods ) Then I was right . You see , Doctor . DOCTOR I 'm afraid so . We knew nothing about that until you spoke of it . MISS MABEL ( Xing to SMALLWOOD , incredulously ) You mean you - you did n't know nothing but that I had written the Will ? MR . SMALLWOOD We had no reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , but how stupid I was ! ( Mrs. WILSON goes to her supportingly ) But you said you knew everything ! MR . SMALLWOOD We thought the Will was everything . MRS . WILSON What other thing ? ( To the others ) What is she talking about ? REV . WILSON Please , Hortense . MISS MABEL ( To SMALLWOOD ) Can you remember what I said ? MR . SMALLWOOD You spoke of something that did not cause your sister any pain . MISS MABEL Dr. Harrison took back what he said to save me from getting into trouble about the Will . If I take back what I said here about the other thing , will that be all right ? p. 96 MR . SMALLWOOD It 's impossible to think of two things like this in the same way , Miss Mabel . Forgery is serious and we were going to conceal our knowledge of it , but - other things are serious beyond comparison . MISS MABEL But what good will it do to tell everybody ? I 've got nothing to lose - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the others  --  MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm afraid it would be unbearable for a man like Rev. Wilson to face the future with such a secret on his mind . MISS MABEL But I said so little , did n't I ? MR . SMALLWOOD It was enough to make all of us feel that there was more than forgery . You do n't deny there was more ? MISS MABEL No , I ca n't . How can I ? MR . SMALLWOOD You see , in law , if you know that a crime has been committed - MISS MABEL You mean that Rev. and Mrs. and Peter and Mary - and all of you would be guilty too ? MR . SMALLWOOD If we concealed our knowledge of the crime . MISS MABEL But that is n't fair ! MR . SMALLWOOD It 's the law . p. 97 MISS MABEL ( After a silence ) Supposing I refuse to say anything to you or anyone else ? MR . SMALLWOOD Then everyone would believe you guilty . What else could they think ? MISS MABEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just a joke ? MR . SMALLWOOD People do n't joke about a thing like murder . MISS MABEL ( With a sigh ) What do you want me to do then ? MR . SMALLWOOD Tell us everything . MISS MABEL Will the truth really help ? ( Looks at them reflectively . SHE gives a gesture of resignation , her eyes widen purposefully ) MR . SMALLWOOD Yes . MISS MABEL When my sister came back here , she made up her mind to despise everybody that lived here . She called them ignorant - stupid - terrible things , too terrible for me to tell you . They said she was mean and stuck-up . That she 'd been living in the North and now the North was still living in her head . One day the idea hit me - to tell her - stop hating - start helping - help with your money . Stop spitting on the roots of your own beginning . p. 98 MR . SMALLWOOD She refused , of course . MISS MABEL ( Waves her hand , unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . She should leave her money for the good of her people . I did n't think she could act any worse . I almost gave up . Then I stopped nagging her and started flattering her . I said something that hit deep down inside her  --  MR . SMALLWOOD And what was that ? MISS MABEL I told her in the eyes of her people , if she did this she would be considered a great woman  --  and since she was n't well , God would grant her longer life . She did want to live for a long time . ( Pause ) My sister agreed to leave half her money . ( Reverently ) Was I happy ! ! Then all of a sudden she started getting letters from some man in New York . First it was one letter a week , then later two or three ! I never saw her so happy ! She said he was in love with her ; he was lonely ; he wanted her . Oh  --  it was the most foolish sweet-talk you ever heard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these letters first start about a year ago ? MISS MABEL Why yes , how did you know ? MR . SMALLWOOD I now recall that it was about a year ago , Mrs. Fletcher first wrote me in New York to locate Mr. Black . After a great deal of investigation , I found he 'd just gotten out of jail . p. 99 MISS MABEL Oh  --  he was a notorious gambler - who 'd live with women and never marry them . He used to borrow money from Irma 's husband . Anybody could see what he wanted with my sister . Well  --  one day a letter came saying he just could n't stand loneliness any longer and was coming after her . That changed her mind . She was going to go to him  --  and so was all her money ! ( SHE Xes left ) MISS MABEL ( Cont 'd ) My brain exploded ! I lost my temper . I told her somehow or someway , I 'd stop her . The fit she threw would make the devil blush ! MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MISS MABEL No , she did n't have time . That was the day before I came to New York and made the Will . That night I made up my mind to forge the Will . I called you pretending to be my sister  --  telling you I was coming to see you . I told my sister I was going shopping in Atlanta . I left that morning - took a plane which nearly scared me to death  --  and got to you by three . I knew you had n't seen my sister in five years . I was scared when I walked into your office . Scared I 'd give myself away . I had such a creepy , funny feeling when you called me " Mrs. Fletcher . " Would n't it have been awful if she had called up while I was there ? MR . SMALLWOOD I wish to God she had . ( Rising , Xing to window ) p. 100 MISS MABEL After everything was signed and sealed , I was half glad and half sorry . I flew right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose in getting back home . I did take time out to buy a new dress , knowing Irma would want to see what I shopped for . Remember , Mrs. Wilson - I had it on the other day ? ( Mrs. WILSON grunts feverishly ) MR . SMALLWOOD This question is going to be important later on - when you made that Will , had you made up your mind your sister would have to die ? MISS MABEL Oh , yes ! When I got home , Irma was packing her bags . She said she was going to this Mr. Black the next day . Imagine that ! I had n't even planned on how I was going to do it . MR . SMALLWOOD What did you mean by Watkins ' assuring you : " She would suffer no pain ? " MISS MABEL Oh that ! Well - I kept wondering how I was going to , you know . That night I was lying in bed - just staring at the stars in the sky . One of the stars winked at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winked at me . Then suddenly it came tumbling down - turning into a shooting star . It shot right down to earth and seemed to land in my yard in a clump of toadstools . A rooster crowed - look like the crowing unlocked the gates of my brain . It was then when I got the idea of poisoning her with the toadstools . ( Mrs. WILSON swoons and is supported by WILSON ) I remember what Watkins told me about them a long time ago , when we were kids . An old woman , thinking they were mushrooms , made a plate of soup with them . She drink it and died without any pain at all  --  Watkins said . That 's all Watkins has to do with it . Irma was so excited about leaving the next day , she went to bed early . Luckily , she could n't sleep . It was easy for me to flatter her that a bowl of soup would relax her . She liked for you to make a fuss over her . I went downstairs and gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a spoon , I rubbed them through a sifter . Then let it cool . It smelled like hot rubber . I mixed in some onions and tomato sauce to kill the odor . Irma drank the soup without ever knowing it was n't mushrooms . She soon fell asleep . About an hour later , she was dead . Then I sent for the Doctor . I felt happy and relieved . All during the time I was stirring the soup , I kept thinking about that statue of justice - with the scales in her hand . In one of the scales I put kids learning to play . I put a host of sick people who might die because there was no hospital about . I put a fine boy building homes for our folks and marrying the girl he loves and a good old man with some land he could call his own before his time was up . In the other scale I put a cranky , stingy , mean old woman about to throw her money away on a sorry pimp ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  stuck in the mud like broken down toys . Though I 'd told Irma God would grant her longer life , I played the part of God and ended her life . And I 'm not sorry . I know what I did was a sin - a bad one - maybe the worst ever imagined . But somehow I think He knows what was in my heart and in my mind - and I got a funny feeling He kinda knows and understands . ( The church bell is heard ringing for the evening program . MISS MABEL looks up surprised , not realizing how late it is ) ( Rising ) Oh , I 'm sorry . I did n't realize how late it was . Here I am sitting  --  talking and talking  --  and it 's time for church . CURTAIN p. 101 p. 102 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE : Miss Mabel 's living-room . The next day . It is a fine sunlit afternoon . SMALLWOOD is wandering to and fro . HARRISON is unsuccessful in attempting to relax in the armchair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself against the mantle . There is a heavy tense silence . No one is able to speak , then -- - REV . WILSON ( Resolving ) Gentlemen - - I know what I 'm going to do -- - ( With great effort ) I 'm going to resign --  --  DOCTOR Resign --  -- - ? MR . SMALLWOOD You ca n't resign from this problem . REV . WILSON I 'm going to resign - from the church -- - MR . SMALLWOOD What good will that do ? REV . WILSON I failed my flock . I failed God . I failed Miss Mabel . But most of all I failed Mrs. Fletcher -- - ( BOTH try to interrupt him , but WILSON waves them aside ) If I had been a true pastor - a real servant of God , I could have shown her the way to human kindness - and human goodness . ( Pause ) REV . WILSON ( Cont 'd ) " Who am I to take out the moat of my neighbor 's eye - and the beam is in my own . " " Judge not that ye be not judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff ! p. 103 MR . SMALLWOOD ( Xing to Wilson ) But this is a community . You and Dr. Harrison are members of this community . As citizens - it is your responsibility to report this matter to the authorities - not mine . DOCTOR ( Conclusively ) All I have is my oath . My duty is to save and preserve life - not to destroy it . MR . SMALLWOOD But the law still stands -- - DOCTOR That 's your specialty , Mr. Smallwood ! You devoted your life to it . So - go ahead , follow through ! MR . SMALLWOOD ( Imploring WILSON ) " Thou Shalt Not Kill . " ( Points accusingly ) You are the logical one to report this crime ! REV . WILSON ( Emphatically ) I 'll consult the Master regarding the sin Miss Mabel has committed . As for her crime - that 's up to you law folks and the court . ( SMALLWOOD drums his hand on the table , thoughtfully ) DOCTOR To the scientist - there are no morals - only verifiable facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . germ , I 'm on the side of the blood corpuscle . MR . SMALLWOOD What 's that got to do with it ? p. 104 DOCTOR In this case , Mrs. Fletcher was the T.B . germ and Miss Mabel was the healthy corpuscle . MR . SMALLWOOD Then you think the means justifies the end ? DOCTOR You 're in doubt yourself . MR . SMALLWOOD Well -- who is n't ? DOCTOR Then why try to make it strictly a local matter instead of accepting your share of the responsibility as a member of society ? REV . WILSON ( Impatiently ) Let 's stop thinking of ourselves . The vital relation is between Miss Mabel and God . We have to be very presumptious men to interfere in that . How do we know those mysterious plans . I tell you it 's my fault . And I 'll answer to Him . MR . SMALLWOOD If we follow the ideas of you two - what kind of a society would we have here ? Nothing but wild anarchy . For you two , it 's simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cold , the ulcer , the broken bone . And you , Rev. Wilson , the lie , backbiting and not being born again . But with the law , we must have an equal justice for everyone . A supreme equity which makes no exceptions for any individual . DOCTOR That 's precisely what gets you into a dilemma like this ! ( Rising , coming to SMALLWOOD ) Would n't we doctors be happy if we had one universal remedy for all diseases . In Tibet , today , women have four or five husbands . The more they support , the higher their standing in the community . But with us - a housewife 's adultery is at least - frowned upon . So - your ideal of a universal criminal code does n't apply to human fact or human history . p. 105 REV . WILSON What we 're dealing with is not human fact - nor human history . It is the state of the soul . We must hate the sin --  not the sinner . MR . SMALLWOOD ( Facing it , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hell hole into a happy valley . But it also makes me a member of the machinery that must punish it . DOCTOR Then you notify the authorities . MR . SMALLWOOD It is my sincere hope that there are twelve other men who feel the same way as the two of you  - -  -  or rather the same way as the three of us . ( MISS MABEL , dressed in a neat , dark costume as if she is going away for a holiday , enters . She is talking to Mrs. WILSON , who follows her with an armful of sheets ) MISS MABEL  - -  - So Mrs. Wilson if you 'll cover the furniture down here like you did upstairs --  I 'll be ready to lock up the house - when the sheriff comes . ( The three men react , startlingly . Mrs. WILSON begins her chores . MISS MABEL is about to exit ) MR . SMALLWOOD ( Incredulously ) You 've already told the --  -- - MISS MABEL ( Lightly ) Oh -- yes - I sent Watkins for the sheriff this morning . ( There is a silence ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I - Miss Mabel every time I had a setback , every time we had a program and no one came , or at the picnic when the windstorm came up and blew away the barbecue , you always came along with a smile and said : " Never mind , Rev. Wilson . We 'll still do it . " You never failed me ! Now in your hour of need , I have failed you --  -- - MISS MABEL That 's my burden , Reverend , not yours . ( MARY and PETER enter , followed by ILAHEE and WATKINS . There is a quiet happy glow about PETER and MARY . The WATKINS tarry just inside the door . ILAHEE is carrying a pot covered with a checkered tablecloth ) MISS MABEL Why Peter and Mary - how nice of you to come --  --  PETER It 's Mr. and Mrs. Barlow now --  --  ( Extends Mary 's finger , showing the wedding ring ) Rev. Wilson married us this morning . MISS MABEL What - what did you say --  --  ? PETER We heard of a job for a couple over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were married . So we did it --  --  MISS MABEL But children - without me - without  - -   - -   MARY But it 's for your sake --  --  p. 107 MISS MABEL I do n't understand . PETER Well - Watkins told us about the sheriff --  --  Now this job in service will give us room and board and one hundred dollars a month in the clear . . . . . So -- we 'll be able to give just about all of it  - -  for your defense . MISS MABEL ( After a pause ) My dear sweet children ! But what about your plans -- - family -- children --  --  MARY You are our family - until you are cleared . PETER That 's right . That 's the way we 've worked it out . MISS MABEL ( Embracing BOTH ) You wonderful - wonderful kids . That 's hardly any marriage at all . ( Releases them , turning quite full to hide her emotions . WATKINS steps forward , pulling out a roll of crushed bills and carefully straightening them out ) WATKINS ( Placing money on the table ) Miss Mabel , Joe Potter give me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ought to get out of trouble . You 'll be needin ' help more'n I need a farm  --  The word ai n't been made that 'll tell you how sorry I am . MISS MABEL ( Overcome )  --  Oh  --  you must n't  - -  -  p. 108 WATKINS Jailhouse food  --  I 'm told  --  is rough on the stomach . Ilahee brought you some food to take with you . ILAHEE ( Removint the napkin ) Honey  --  in this pot is every cent I got in this world . Lawyers and courts cost a heap of money . Take them . They 're yours . ( MISS MABEL presses her palms against her face , unable to speak ) WATKINS ( Surprised at Ilahee ) You told me that was a pot of vittuels ! ( Fingering the coins ) There 's hundreds and hundreds in there . Where 'd you get ' em ? ILAHEE I 've saved every Lincoln head penny I ever got hold of . Lincoln freed grandma . I figure these Lincoln heads would come day free me from earthly worry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that matters now is your freedom . There 'll be nothing that I 'll be wanting in a world that 's mean enough to keep you in jail  --  not even a decent burial . MISS MABEL ( She stares at them , deeply touched by their generosity . She Xs to the window to suppress her tears ) WATKINS What 'll happen now - when you die ? ILAHEE Just find a hole and hide - till you come and join me. p. 109 WATKINS You 're a sweet woman , Ilahee . ILAHEE I know it , Jeremiah . MISS MABEL ( Her courage re-enforced by the sacrifices , she comes to SMALLWOOD ) Mr. Smallwood - you know about these things . What am I to expect ? What will they do ? MR . SMALLWOOD There will be an autopsy - to establish the poisoning- MISS MABEL Ca n't they take my word for it ? MR . SMALLWOOD They have to prove these things . MISS MABEL It seems so silly and unnecessary to disturb her . ( Pause ) They 'll arrest me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid so . MISS MABEL Then I 'll get my bag . It 's all packed . I 'm ready . MRS . WILSON Let me help . ( Starting out ) MISS MABEL ( Stopping at the door ) Do you think they 'll let me come home again ? MR . SMALLWOOD I do n't think so . MISS MABEL Surely they do n't think I 'd try to run away . p. 110 MR . SMALLWOOD The law would n't allow bail in a matter like this . MISS MABEL ( To Mrs. WILSON as they are exiting ) I could use another day . ( They 're gone ) MR . SMALLWOOD ( Trying to lift Wilson 's spirit as well as his own ) I 'll personally pay the cost of her defense . WATKINS ( Proudly ) Mr and Ilahee have already raised all the money she 'll need . ( Indicates the bills and pennies MR . SMALLWOOD ( After a generous pause ) That 's fine of you , Mr. Watkins , but that sum would n't pay for a trial like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our money goes for her help no matter who horns in . MR . SMALLWOOD As you wish , sir . REV . WILSON ( To Smallwood ) I 'm sure you 'll do what 's right . But what can I do ? How can I help ? MR . SMALLWOOD Defending counsel will know the best way to use all of our help . WATKINS Aw - He 'll say she 's innocent . p. 111 MR . SMALLWOOD I do n't know . It depends entirely on him . But you can be certain a good man will bring out everything possible in her favor . ( MISS MABEL enters , followed by Mrs. WILSON , who carries Miss Mabel 's handbag and a book . MISS MABEL has a few loose sheets of paper in her hand . SHE puts her coat and case down on the table near the door ) MISS MABEL I 've written a will ! My own Will this time ! ( SMALLWOOD pauses incredulously ) MISS MABEL Oh , but I 'm glad I thought of this . It 's exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretended to be my sister - except , of course , I have n't bothered to leave this little home to myself . The house will go to Peter and Mary . ( SHE smiles . SMALLWOOD tries to interrupt ) It would be silly to leave anything to yourself in your own Will , would n't it ? I never thought of it before , but now the other Will 's no good and my sister 's dead and all the money comes to me , it would be awful if I died without a Will , because then the money would never go to the hospital , the church and the other things at all . ( SHE goes to the table ) Now , if I sign it and you witness it , Mr. Smallwood , everything will be all right . MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm afraid it wo n't be any good , Miss Mabel . p. 112 MISS MABEL ( Astonished ) Why not ? MR . SMALLWOOD No person may benefit in any way as a result of their crime . MISS MABEL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They could n't be that cruel and mean as to take the money away from  - -  -  MR . SMALLWOOD It 's never been theirs , Miss Mabel . And it never can from any Will of yours , because you , yourself , will never receive the money . MISS MABEL But after all I 've gone through ? You mean it was all for nothing ? MR . SMALLWOOD I 'm afraid so . MISS MABEL But the money must go to someone ! MR . SMALLWOOD It would go to the United States Government . To the treasury . MISS MABEL But they 've got so much , and Rev. Wilson and the others have so little . MR . SMALLWOOD It 's the law . MISS MABEL But you 're so clever about these things . There must be a way . ( MISS MABEL sits in the armchair by the fireplace . Rev. WILSON goes to her and lays his hand on her shoulder ) p. 113 REV . WILSON You must n't think of it , Miss Mabel . The church - the hospital - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , and we are going to save you . No matter what it costs , or what we have to do , we wo n't rest again until this nightmare 's over and you are safely back with us in your own home . MISS MABEL I - I do n't deserve anything from you . I wanted to give so much - and I gave you nothing but shame . ( A sudden thought occurs to her . A new light comes into her eyes , and SHE turns excitedly to Smallwood ) Mr. Smallwood , when the sheriff comes , will you tell them I forged that Will ? MR . SMALLWOOD No . It 's not a part of my duty to tell them that . I 'll only tell them that you confessed to giving poison to your sister . MISS MABEL Then nobody will know about the forgery ? MR . SMALLWOOD No one but the beneficiaries . MISS MABEL Oh - that 's wonderful ! Then everything 's all right , and they will get the money after all . To everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you all agreed to say no more about it . The only one who would n't benefit is the one who poisoned her , and I do n't want anything . ( SHE jumps up , trembling with excitement and happiness ) The new church and center is all right , Rev. Wilson . And the hospital and Peter 's career , and Mr. Watkins ' farm ! I knew they 'd be a way ! p. 114 MR . SMALLWOOD All this did occur to us , Miss Mabel , but I 'm afraid it 's impossible . MISS MABEL But why ? MR . SMALLWOOD Because the whole story - the true story , just as you told it to us  --  will be a tremendous weapon in the hands of the counsel who is going to defend you . MISS MABEL I do n't quite understand . MR . SMALLWOOD Do n't you see ? He 'll bring witnesses like the minister and the doctor to prove how you gave everything you had to the people of the town , and I guarantee he 'll make every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the same temptation , they might have done the same thing . ( Pause ) That will be our defense . MISS MABEL That means they 'd have to know all about the forgery . DOCTOR They must . MISS MABEL And there 'd be no money for the hospital and the church ? MR . SMALLWOOD Not from the money your sister left . MISS MABEL What kinda man are you ! Why ca n't you understand ? Those are the things I done it for ? MR . SMALLWOOD What Rev. Wilson said just now is that we all feel . You are more important than all these things and we must defend you with everything we have . p. 115 MISS MABEL I never heard such nonsense . How can one person be worth a church and hospital that 's going to give happiness to hundreds and hundreds of my people for years to come ? MR . SMALLWOOD That 's a fine unselfish gesture , but  --  MISS MABEL Really , Mr. Smallwood , you make me sick . First , you said it was your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you say it 's your duty to throw everything away to get me off ! I do n't think you 're any good at all ! MR . SMALLWOOD You must realize how very difficult it 's been for all of us . As law-abiding citizens , we could n't conceal our knowledge of such a crime . Now we 're going to do everything in our power within the law to secure the mercy that you deserve . MISS MABEL ( Sweeping the whole room ) If you had had your way at the start , none of you would 've let me give my sister the toadstools , and you 'd never got the money . If you had your way now , you 'd tell them all about the forgery and you still would n't get the money . Really , I 'm beginning to wonder whether you deserve the money at all ! DOCTOR We all know what you 've tried to do for us , Miss Mabel . MISS MABEL Then will you do one thing for me in return ? p. 116 MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Of course ! What can we do ? You know we will . Personally , I 'd do anything . MISS MABEL Then will you all please keep quiet and not interfere ? I know you 've done everything for the best , but there 's been too much law about it and not enough common sense . I started this by myself without anybody 's help , and I m going to finish it by myself . Is that understood ? ( Pause ) Is that understood ? You have to understand how I 've longed with all my heart and soul - to bring a little happiness and comfort to my people . Would you be so cruel as to rob me of the one really worthwhile thing I 've ever been able to do ? ( There is a knock at the door . VOICES are heard outside . MISS MABEL quickly tears up the futile Will she made ) We must n't leave this thing around . ( SHE throws it in the fireplace ) ( DEPUTY MOORE , a Negro deputy sheriff  --  a kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  everybody  --  ( THEY nod  --  then to Miss Mabel with reverence ) Well , Miss Mabel , I have orders from the sheriff to arrest you . MISS MABEL Yes , Deputy Moore . And how 's Mrs. Moore and the children ? p. 117 DEPUTY MOORE Just tolerable , thank you . You 'll have to come along with me . MR . SMALLWOOD I will come with you , Miss Mabel . MISS MABEL I do n't want you to come ! I can take care of myself . ( Pause ) May I say something , please ! DEPUTY MOORE You should say whatever you have to say to the sheriff in his office . MISS MABEL But there 'd be no harm in saying it here .

MISS MABEL relates the story factually sans emotion ) I was my sister 's only relative . She was rich and I was poor . By rights her money would have come to me when she died . But she hated me . We quarrelled and to punish me , she went to New York and saw Mr. Smallwood here and wrote a Will leaving everything she had to other people . All she left me was her half-share in this small house and not a single penny of her money . Mr. Smallwood can show you the Will to prove it . It was a spiteful way to punish me and I made up my mind to punish her for it . So I murdered her as she deserved - - - ( Sharply )  - -  - yes , murdered her . You found out what I did , but I do n't care , because I 've nothing to lose . That 's all . p. 118 DEPUTY MOORE ( Shuts his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be going .
