Fully a quarter of the nation 's radio listeners are on wheels-and often listening hard for word of road conditions . To get extra mileage from this vast audience , the Mutual Broadcasting System has set up an experimental " auto network " of 31 stations stretching from Buffalo to Miami . Purpose : frequent weather announcements plus advice not only on the best routes but on what local station to tune in for news of conditions on the next leg of a long drive north or south . If the new scheme works out , Mutual plans to extend it to all 450 network affiliates.
