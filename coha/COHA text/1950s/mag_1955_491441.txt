Our Youngest Ambassadors By HARU MATSUKATA TOKYO . NE dreary day last autumn , in a corner of the drab , overcrowded and noisy airport at Tokyo , a pretty girl , dressed in a striking peach kimono , and a tall , handsome boy were bowing and shaking hands with friends , saying good-by . This ordinary scene at a Japanese airport was unusual because I he boy and girl were American farmers  --  Margaret Lee Stevens , of Goldsboro , North Carolina , and John William Upton , Jr. , of Norman Park , Georgia . Also , their friends were not well-dressed city people but busy farmers , who had taken time out from their rice harvesting and had traveled far to see them off . Immediately after the war , young farmers like Margaret and Bill , members of 4-H Clubs and other rural organizations in America , wanted to make some contribution to world peace . They came to the conclusion that they could do their part best by helping to further an understanding between the rural peoples around the world , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farm Youth Exchange . Since 1947 , when this was started , several hundred American farm youths have gone to more than thirty countries in the world . A similar number of exchangees from foreign countries have gone to the United States to observe American rural life . Because these boys and girls have achieved their goal of promoting better understanding among thousands of farm people , they have been aptly called the " grass-roots ambassadors . " Each country pays for the transportation costs of its delegates , but all expenses in the foreign country are paid by their hosts . An average of $2000 must be raised in the United States to finance each two-way exchange . In America , $700 of this amount israised within the participating state . IFYE ( pro .. nounced eefee ) , as this is called , is sponsored and conducted jointly by the National 4-H Club Foundation and the Cooperative Extension Service . This is the second year of the exchange between Japan and America . Unfortunately , due to insufficient Japanese funds , only two delegates could be sent . Ac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese boy and girl ? both national winners of 4-H projects  --  Kazuta Otsu , nineteen , of ' Odawara City , Kanagawa Prefecture , and Yoko Iwata , nineteen , of Matsue City , Shimane Prefecture , went this summer to America for six months and visited several farm families , including the homes of Margaret and Bill . Both Americans have lived on farms all their ' lives and have been active 4-II members in their own communities for many years . Bill , twenty-one , graduated last June from the University of Georgia , where he majored in animal husbandry . Margaret , also twenty-one , has one more year in home economics at the Women 's College , University of North Carolina . Their similar backgrounds , plus : their eagerness to understand people . qualified them to apply as an " outbound IFYE delegate . " In May it came as an unexpected surprise to them to learn that they had been selected and were assigned to . Japan . After finishing the school year  --  with just a week at home to pack and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington , D.C. , where they met for the first time . In a two-week orientation course , with all the . outbound delegates , they learned about the countries to which they were going . The last week in . June they arrived in Japan by plane . At the airport , David Y. Takahara , managing director of the 441 Clubs of Japan , and officials of the Ministry of Agriculture gave them a warm welcome . It was strange in many respects to Margaret and Bill . As the latter recalled his first impressions of Japan on that dreary , wet day : " I 'll never forget two things  --  the friendliness of the people who met us , and the unusual sight of people shaking bands and bowing at the same time . " Very soon he was doing the same thing . From July through October , the two Americans traveled together all over Japan , but lived separately with eight farm families in six prefectures . From each family they learned something new about Japanese farming  --  how farmers grow rice in paddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up steep hills , and how farmers raise silk cocoons in their homes . " In such a short period these Americans have already become better qualified to talk about Japanese agriculture than almost any Japanese farmer , " a prefectural official remarked to me . One sunny day in October I drove out into the country , fifty miles from Tokyo , to meet Margaret and Bill , where they were living with their farmer hosts . The rows of persimmon trees laden with shining ripe fruit , the dark thatch-roof houses nestling in groves of green bamboo and pine , and the stretches of golden rice fields against the backdrop of snow-capped Mt . Fuji ? this was a delightful sight to me after the noisy , dirty , overcrowded city I had left behind . Turning from the seacoast highway into a narrow lane in the village of Ishibashi , my guide told me to atop at a small farmhouse . In front of thehouse , separated from the road by a low stone wall , a young man was emptying tangerines from a large bamboo basket onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Margaret 's host . Welcoming us , he ran into the house and whispered to someone behind a paper door . Returning , he smiled and said in Japanese , " Please come in and wait a minute . Margaretto-san is prettying up . " Pointing to the steep hills in front of us , he explained , " We just came back from a morning 's work of picking tangerines in the hills up there . " We stepped over the wooden threshold into the cool , dim entrance hall . This part of the farmhouse , with its mud floor , is where the farmers work when it rains , and where they store their crops before taking them to market . Surrounding this space on two sides , on a higher level , are the straw-matted rooms  --  conspicuous for lack of furniture . While we waited for Margaret here , Kenichi told me he was just twenty years old . But because his father had been killed in the war , he was now the head of his family . It consists of his mother ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be married next year ; and a younger brother in middle school , seventeen . The family owns seven and one half acres of hills planted with tangerine trees , and these trees keep the family and a hired helper busy all year . From October through December they are especially busy picking six tons of tangerines . The prefectural officials who select the homes for the Americans chose Kenichi 's because he is chairman of the 4-H Club in his village and vice-chairman of the 4-H Prefectural Liaison Committee . Asked how he felt about having an American girl in his home , he was quick to reply , " We have no feeling at all she is a foreigner : * He said that they were a little anxious before she came , because it was the first time they had associated with an American , especially because they spoke no English ? how were they going to communicate with her ? " But , " be continued , " as soon as Margaretto-san arrived , she put us at ease . With her cheerfulness and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just then the paper door in front of me slid open and Margaret , a tall , pretty brunette with lovely dimples , came out . She gracefully sat down on the tatami , bowing in perfect Japanese style , greeted me in Japanese and invited me to come in . As is customary , I slipped off my shoes as I stepped up into her room . We sat on the floor on small cushions opposite each other at a low table . Margaret had been obliged to learn some Japanese because , with the exception of one home she had visited , none of the families spoke any English . She was delighted to be able to speak in English again  --  something she had n't done for so many weeks . In talking about her difficulties in learning Japanese , she remarked , " The lack of a common language has never been an obstacle in understanding each ot her in any of the homes I 've been . The only times I have really longed for a good interpreter were at some of the meet ings wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innumerable times when college and high-school boys and girls asked her opinion on t he hydrogen bomb , still a live subject in Japan , and ol her delicate issues . ) It was not only Margaret who Mt that way about a common language ; farmer host of hers remarked to me , " This spring a young ( Japanese ) farmer came to live at my house as an apprentice . Even after ninety days with him , I did n't reach the understanding I attained in a week with my American guest . It made me realize how much we Japanese are hound by rules of etiquette and formal behavior , and make the road to an exchange of hearts too long . We really have something to learn from I he Americans . " To the delight of her Japanese hosts , Margaret expressed great interest in Japanese culture , In her room , on I he tokonoma ( decorative alcove ) , was a Japanese arrangement of golden-yellow chrysani hemtlins she had made . At a tea ceremony which she attended with one of her friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking questions . This was a novel experience for the teacher , who was one of the masters of the art and a good interpreter as well . He wits surprised , but also impressed . Later he told a Japanese reporter , " I 've never had a pupil with such an eager spirit of seeking the truth . In all the years I have taught young girls 4Japaneael , they 've never asked questions ; they 've been satisfied imitating just the form . I thought Americans were superficial , but Margaret Stevens would n't be satisfied until she under-stood . " Word had spread ahead of her that their American friend liked the native costume , so on arrival in one of the prefectures Margaret was presented with a welcoming present of a peach-colored silk kimono . None were more Pleased than the farmers who had given her the kimono when they saw her wearing it at the airport the day she returned home . Several hours after I talked to her in the farmhouse , Margaret and I climbed the steep hills overlooking the beautiful sea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walking hack alone I heard Margaret singing a Japanese song with Kenichi and his sister . I had great admiration for this young American girl , who had so graciously and cheerfully fitted into this totally different environment on her very first trip away from home  --  and so far away ! When we were driving again , my patient guide , who had come with me because he was the technical adviser to the young farmers of this neighborhood , spoke about Bill Upton , whom we were now going to visit . Although Bill had learned less Japanese than Margaret , still he was using all he knew to great advantage . My guide said , " In I he village where he is staying , he takes the initiative to greet everybody in Japanese with such warmth and genuineness , no one can resist being friendly with him . " It was almost dusk when we reached the large farmhouse with the blue-painted roof in the middle of the yellow rice fields . The spacious house was completely open and deserted . The only signs of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn and the fluttering of the white Leghorns . Soon , a young girl came running home . After telling me that Upton-san lived here and was expected back from the fields in a few minutes , she disappeared into the house . I thought this would be a good opportunity to talk to her about Bill , so I went to look for her . I found her in the back of the house , in a dark , smoky kitchen , where she was beginning to prepare supper . She was cutting vegetables and had started a wood fire under the big rice pot . " It 's so dirty in here ; please do n't come in , " she said , quite embarrassed . To retreat graciously , I asked to wash my hands . She picked up a basin , led me to the sink outside and pumped water for me . As I finished washing , a friendly greeting made me turn around to face a tall , good-looking boy . Bill acted quite the host . After taking off his favorite Japanese shoes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the guest room , his room . Before we had a chance to start talk- ing , a group of young boys in black school uniforms came calling . They introduced themselves as students of the local agricultural middle school . They were on the school paper and wanted an interview . These boys were members of the FFJ ? Future Farmers of Japan ? and they wanted to know in detail about its American counterpart , FFA , which is a club in rural high schools to create interest . in farming , separate from the 4-H . Farm youths in Japan first become FFJ 's in high school and , upon graduation from middle school at the age of aeventeen , become 4-H Club members . They could n't speak English , so they had brought questions written out in English , and they expected Bill to reply in writing . As it happened , the interview progressed more smoothly because 1 was there to bridge the language gap . They did n't leave till they had exhausted a roll of film taking pictures of their new friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one of the four boys . By that time the entire family had returned from work . Dinner was ready and I was invited to stay . The Tsuiki family , I found , was small , compared to ordinary farm families ? Takeshi , the only son , aged twenty , now the main worker in the family ; daughter . Kazuko , twenty-three ; and their mother . The father had been killed in the war . They grow rice and vegetables and tangerines on three and a half acres of land , and they own live acres of woodland . The dinner was a happy occasion . Because of my presence , for the first time since Bill 's arrival the Tsuikis were able to find out all the things they had wanted to know about him and his family , and Bill found out a lot that . was puzzling him . For dinner we had a typical farmer 's meal ? plenty of rice , broiled fish , some cooked vegetables and pickles and tea . Bill ate everything with the rest of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family told me they made special dishes for him , but stopped that when he politely declined to eat anything the family did n't eat . Both Margaret and Bill learned to like sashimi ? a raw-fish delicacy  --  but I 'm sure they would have gladly swapped this for a real American homemade dessert any time . While we were still eating , many 4-H Club members from the village arrived and were waiting in the next room to have a meeting with Bill . Bill told me that MI h he and Margaret on most days had two or three such meetings . The 4-H Club is a postwar innovation in Japan , introduced by the Americans during the occupation . Its phenomenal growth in six years since its beginning may he seen in the 8478 4-H Clubs and more than 150,000 members among Japan 's rural youth . Since each member is required to have a project , young boys and girls are finding ways of improving farming and , what is quite important , improving rural living conditions . The enthusiasm of the 4-H Club members and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took much longer for the American 4-H Club idea , founded forty years ago , to develop . Akira Sugiyama , twenty , a young , bright-looking farmer sitting opposite Bill on the floor , said he had heard Bill 's family owned a large 150-acre farm , a tractor and a truck . He said , " Is n't it wonderful to have so much land and machinery to do the work ? You roust lead an easy life compared to ours ? full of problems , working a small plot , of land . " Bill quickly replied at length , " My father 's farm is a hundred and fifty acres , but only a hundred acres of it are cultivated . We have a tractor and a truck , but to us they are absolute necessities . Without them we could n't work or raise our crops of corn , cotton and tobacco or care for the cattle and 82 THE SATU111 ) EVENING POST February 19 , MS sheep . On your small farms you could n't use a tractor , except possibly a garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile as yours , so we must use large quantities of fertilizer . We have only one tenth the rainfall you have tsixty-two inches ) ; perhaps you have too much sometimes , but many years we have n't enough to have a crop . " My father has worked for many years to buy the land he works on , but he has n't been able to save enough money . Even though you have only three and a hull acres of land , you get more yield per acre than we ever thought of . You are fortunate because you now own your own land , you own your own house and whatever you grow is yours . Each year many Americans like us get loans in the beginning of 1 he year to buy seed , fertilizer and gasoline to run our machines , and we are lucky if we can repay the loans at I he end of the year . My father did n't have enough money to send me to college . I worked my way through the first two years , but I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go home after this , I have to work and repay the money I borrowed . " Quite satisfied , Akira said , " We are glad to hear that Americans have problems too . " Another boy having troubles of his own asked . " Do you have problems in America of girls not wanting to marry farmers , as we do ' ? " Bill replied smilingly , " I 'm afraid the Anierican girl is only concerned about the boy when she marries , and not whether she is marrying a farmer . She realizes that too late ! " Everybody in the room broke into loud laughter . Like many . Japanese , these young farmers had a great many misconceptions about Americans . Young Kazuta Otte ' , a 4-1-1 member from their village , went to the States last summer as Bill 's exchange . While visiting his first American family , Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Erman , of Coshocton , Ohio , he wrote a letter back home and told these boys how mistaken they were . He wrote : " An idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they dominate the men is n't true . Women here do n't work in the fields as our women do , because machinery does most of I he hard work . But Mrs. Erman works very hard in the home and takes care of the turkeys 4130 ) and chickens ( 25 ) . She plans and prepares full , nourishing meals and puts up a lot of preserved food grown on the farm . The cellar is full of these jars . " The farmers work hard and are very serious . They say a prayer before each meal and do not work on Sundays , but go to church . . . . I have gone to many farms , but none of the men drink . It has made me think , because when we have parties we think sake ( Japanese rice wine ) is necessary to have a good time . Here families bring together home-cooked dishes and both t he young and old have a good time together . They usually drink iced tea or fruit juice . It shows how strongly Christianity has penetrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unlike what we have seen in Hollywood movies . " For these young boys to know Bill , who they found was just a farmer like themselves , was an endorsement of what their friend in America had to say about Americans . The meeting was brought to a close reluctantly near midnight . I still had not had a chance to talk to Bill , so , with little urging , I accepted an invitation to stay overnight . Bill was asked to start the bath line , as a single bath is prepared for the entire family every night . Dressed in a cotton-padded , brown silk kimono , Bill looked quite Japanese , except that he had to duck his head low as he re -- turned through the doorway . " Upton-san , next time you come we shall have a new house built for your height , " Takeshi , his host , remarked . As a special concession to the late night , getting-up time was set for 6:30 instead of the usual 5:00 o'clock . Next day I finally had my talk with Bill before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to plow the field and to plant some cabbage seedlings . On my way hack to the city I reflected with pleasure and is little awe on the delightful understanding I had witnessed . Of this International Farm Youth Exchange a farmer at the base of Mt . Fuji had this to say , " The great people in the city neglect us farmers , but we are half of Japan 's population . This is the first time ambassadors have come to us , and they became members of our families . This is real grass roots and true internationalism . If all Americans were like Upton-san and Margaretto-san , we would n't have had a war , nor would we in the future have one . Send us more grass-roots ambassadors . "
