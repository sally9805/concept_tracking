txt Sam Rayburn has been a member of the House of Representatives for forty-five years and as Speaker is one of the most respected and powerful men in the United States Government . But he does n't own the Capitol . Yet one would think he did , judging by the way his pet scheme to alter the East Front of that historic building is being pushed ahead irrespective of Senate protests , without House hearings and in utter disregard of public opinion and the judgment of some of the most prominent architects in America today . A. Senate committee has just unanimously approved a bill to reconsider the proposed **25;1268;TOOLONG extension of the East Front ; but Mr , Rayburn says that nonetheless he expects the plans to be submitted for bids as scheduled . He is on perfectly secure legal ground , for as long ago as 1955 Congress , with virtually no thought and no debate , authorized this nonsensical scheme to give the House a little more eating , working and walking space at a cost of many millions and the defacement of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this piece of vandalism is admittedly belated . It is , however , genuine and it ought at the very least move the Speaker and his pliant Commission for the Extension of the Capitol , which now controls the situation , to defer any irrevocable action until all the - alternatives can be fairly considered . This would be the only democratic thing , as well as the only reasonable thing , to do . No one begrudges the House its desire for more space , although the third House office building now under way might be expected to go far to fill that need . The plan being pushed by Mr. Rayburn , who is no architect , and also by , Architect of the Capitol J. George Stewart , who is also no architect but a former Congressman , a former Senate committee clerk and a civil engineer , is based on one of two schemes put forward fifty-three years ago , and the less desirable one at that . No . plan to disturb the East Front would be satisfactory , least of all a plan that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half feet , re-erect an imitation in marble and alter the present fine relationship between the East Front and the House and Senate wings . The Capitol Building means a great deal to Americans , and the part that would be changed happens to be the oldest section of that building . The Capitol is an authentic bit of the history of our country , as Daniel Webster recognized when he wrote these words which were placed in the cornerstone of the House-Senate extension of 1851 : * * * And all here assembled , whether belonging to public life , or to private life , with hearts devotedly thankful to Almighty God for the preservation of the liberty and happiness of the country , unite in sincere and fervent prayers that this deposit , and the walls and arches , the domes and towers , the columns and entablatures , now to be erected over it , may endure forever . Cod save the United States . of America .                   @ @
