Airborne leathernecks of the Marine Corps ' First Air Wing made a dashing debut in Korea last week . Taking off from a Navy carrier , gull-winged Corsair fighter-bombers attacked antiaircraft emplacements , troop concentrations , bridges and transports in the vital Chinju area . In low , ground-hugging runs , the Corsairs flushed Red soldiers out of haystacks and woods . <P> The Marine action was part of a general plan to prevent enemy troops from crossing the Naktong River in strength . Jet F-80 Shooting Stars and F-51 Mustangs ranged up &; down the river valley looking for enemy concentrations , went after patrols that managed to get across . Rainstorms prevented constant vigilance , but on one fair day the Far East Air Forces and Royal Australian Air Force fighters and bombers flew a record 550 sorties . <P> Meanwhile , B-29s continued to attack the enemy 's factories. * Pilots carrying out a follow-up raid on a big oil refinery at Wonsan ( one of the principal fuel sources of the North Korean tanks ) , which had been bombed by B-29s the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel . " In three big strikes , B-29s had dropped 1,300 tons of bombs on the Chosen Nitrogen Chemical Co. at Hungnam , 126 miles north of the 38th parallel . The Air Force claimed to have severely damaged at least a third of the " buildings , laboratories , power plants and warehouses " in the target area . <P> At week 's end the B-29s switched back to tactical targets , hit the battered Seoul rail yards with 100 tons of bombs , and bombed railroad bridges to the south . There were indications that the North Korean air force , which has been lying low for weeks , might be getting reinforcements from Russia . F-80 Shooting Stars , twice raiding Kimpo airfield near Seoul last week , counted more than a score of La7 and Yak fighters which had not been there a few days before . The Americans shot up nine of the newcomers . <P> <P> * Washington learned last week that much of the information on which the B-29s were basing their bombing of industrial targets had been obtained by Edwin W. Pauley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Korea , he had made a trip through North Korea , taking photographs and collecting data , in a survey of Japanese assets to guide U.S. reparations policy .
