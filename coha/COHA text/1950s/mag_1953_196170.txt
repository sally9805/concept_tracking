For the first three years of his life , Billy was just another blue-eyed , blond youngster playing noisiiy and energetically with the neighbors ' kids in Phoenix . Then one day he was hit by a car . Except for a bump on the head , he seemed unhurt and soon he was out playing again . But within a few days , he fell on a playmate 's porch and lay there in a convulsive seizure . At the hospital , his parents learned that Billy 's brain had been injured when he was hit by the car . <P> Billy 's condition kept getting worse , and his parents became more desperate . His frequent seizures threw him to the floor where he cut his lips , blacked his eyes and bruised his body . He became frightened and insecure-the more so as other children shunned him . <P> " A Saint . " Billy 's parents went deep into debt , taking him to psychologists , psychiatrists and neurosurgeons ( he had one brain operation , to no result ) . When they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hood , director of Los Angeles ' Institute for Child Study . Psychologist Hood said simply : " Bring the child to me . " Billy 's parents took him to Hood 's special training school . There , for nine months , Hood lived and worked with Billy . Today , Billy is attending public school . Says his mother simply : " Mr. Hood is a saint . " <P> Nobody knows precisely how many cases there are like Billy 's , but they number hundreds of thousands . Famed Neurosurgeon Tracy Jackson Putnam estimates the number of brain-injured persons in the U.S. at as many as 2,500,000 . Of these , he says , 13% have cerebral palsy ( in which the injury to the brain involves the motor centers ) , and for them , much is being done . Perhaps 30% are so mentally retarded ( often because of birth injuries ) that they can be given little but affectionate care . <P> The group for whom most can be done , and least is now being done , according to Putnam and Hood , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been crippled by such things as blows , encephalitis , or a sustained high fever in infancy . Their plight is often worse , in a way , than that of the mentally retarded , because they know they are different and yet can not help their failures and seizures . <P> Most of them are lost in time and space . Many can not judge distances . Billy , for example , is missing the tip of one finger : he was pointing at the whirling wheel of a bicycle on a kickstand and jammed his finger into the spokes , which had seemed to him at a safe distance . Often they can not count unless they can touch the objects . Most victims have a tantalizingly short attention span , so that teaching them calls for Job-like patience , but paradoxically they suffer from perseveration - the tendency to keep on saying a word or repeating an action long after the occasion for it has passed .
