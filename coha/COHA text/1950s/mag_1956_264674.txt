THE SAILOR , SENSE OF HUMOUR &; OTHER STORIES ( 369 pp. ) -V . S. Pritchett-Knopf ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> The scene is a suburban English pub , and two middle-aged ladies named Margaret and Jill are having a quiet chat . Suddenly , a bitter accusation flashes above the gin . Margaret , hiking her skirt , declares that Jill has brought a flea into her life . It seems that the flea-not an " ordinary " London one but " some great black foreign brute " - sprang from Jill onto Margaret . But why was Jill harboring the flea in the first place ? Because a young sailor had given it to her-not intentionally , of course , but because he and Jill went to bed together , and ( to put it briefly ) " fleas hop . " By the end of the story , poor Jill is lying prone on the barroom floor , overcome by shame , double gins , and the loss of her flea-giving lover . <P> This flea circus , a hilarious yarn , sets the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V. S. ( for Victor Sawdon ) Pritchett . At 55 , Pritchett is perhaps the best literary critic now writing in English . He is also a subtle interpreter of national character and environment ( The Spanish Temper ) and an occasional but brilliant dabbler in fiction . He calls his short stories " the only kind of writing that has given me pleasure and always elated me . " The elation is shared by the reader . <P> Pritchett criticism resembles an elaborately woven square of cloth which , held up at one end , hangs together all of a piece . The Pritchett short story is just the opposite . It exists ( as modern life does , in Pritchett 's view ) " in fragments rather than as solid mass , " and exults in bursts of fire , sharp changes of tempo , explosions of mood . And it is usually extremely cheerful , regardless of what it is about-as if the characters , like their author , were glad to escape from the stiffer world of Pritchett criticism . <P> <P> The Saint , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words : " When I was seventeen years old , I lost my religious faith . " Such a loss would weigh heavily on Pritchett in his critical capacity , but in one of his short stories , it is a sure sign of gusto to follow . Ten pages after the loss has been reported , the bereaved youth is floating disconsolately downstream in a punt , while the evangelist who has come to restore his faith is clinging hopelessly to the branch of a willow tree and slowly sinking , like " a declining dogma , " into the cold river water . The moral of this brisk little story is : Be sure your feet are on firm ground before you extend a helping hand . <P> In The Oedipus Complex , a jolly dentist assures his patient he 'll whip out a bad tooth " in a couple of shakes . " He takes a couple of shakes ; the tooth breaks . " So that 's the game , is it ? " crows the dentist , still merry as a grig . He assaults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another piece breaks off . " We 'll have to saw , " cries the delighted dentist . While the tooth is sawed , button-hooked , drilled and shaken , the dentist , dropping his guard for an instant , admits to the patient that he ( the dentist ) has suffered hell in his private life . But that 's all over now . Life is wonderful . " That gum of yours is going to be sore , " the dentist blandly concludes .
