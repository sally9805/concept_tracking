txt Special . to The New York Tithes , BONN , Germany , Dec , 6 ? The Soviet proposal to transform West Berlin into a demilitarized free city may have a fine-sounding ring to it in Ghana or India or in any other far off place where communism has not yet become a menace . But here in Germany , where East Europe 's experience Sounds a continuous warning , the ring is hollow and the proposal is seen as a sham . No responsible person in West Germany believes that only the future of West Berlin and its 2,300,000 people is at stake in this latest crisis with the Soviet Union . Adolf Hitler said in Mein Kampf , the blueprint for his conquests that he wrote long before coming to power in Ger- , many : " An intelligent victor will , whenever possible , present his demands to the vanquished in installments , " West Germany Next The logic of the Soviet drive to win all Europe demands that West Germany become the next installment if West Berlin falls . But Berlin must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communist 's front line in Central Europe , a shining re-. minder not only to East Germany 's eighteen millions but to neighboring Poland and Czechoslovakia as well that there is a way of life other than that imposed on them by communism . The East Germans , Poles and Czechs can not hope to get to Paris or London or New York . But many of them do conic to East Berlin and it is only a subway ride from one part of the divided city to the other ? from greyness and restrictions to bright lights that somehow have come to be regarded as a symbol of a free if imperfect existence , The world 's future may be decided eventually in the Far East by political allegiances won or exacted from the teeming millions of India and China . But this is 1958 , and the balance of power in the world still lies in ancient Europe . The heart of Europe remains Germany . It is not a question of size . The truncated postwar borders of all Germany , East and West , encompass an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , Pennsylvania and Virginia together , The population is more important ? the two Germanys ' seventy million form the biggest single nation in Europe outside of the Soviet Union , But it is not numbers alone that are important in this situa- ' tion . It is the skills , energy , resources and industrial prowess that these people possess that would tip the scales were they all to fall under Soviet domination . The great bulk of these skills , energy , ? resources and industrial powers lie in West Germany , By winning West Germany the Soviets would gather in Europe 's most productive industrial complex , including twenty-five million tons of steel annually , 160 million tons of coal and nearly ninety billion kilowatt hours of electricity . And  --  most important of all '  --  the capture of West Germany for communism would move Soviet power more than 150 miles to the west . Soviet power would then crouch directly over the rest of Western Europe and would probably suck it up like a giant vacuum sweeper . There would be no alternative for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened and alone , and probably make a deal with the Russians to assure survival . Even if the Western Allies did not have the moral commitment to defend West Berlin 's freedom they would need to do ' everything in their power to prevent its falling to the Communists . It is not a matter of dying for Berlin as allied officials see the I issue . It is not even a matter of 1 saving West Berlin . It is a matter of protecting their own interests . Western Pledge In any case the Western allies do have a commitment to defend West Berlin 's freedom . This is one of a great network of commitments ranging around the world on which the whole Western security system is based , That security system depends not only on firepower and mill ' tary and economic potential but also on the conviction of the people concerned that the United States will truly live up to the guarantees which it has given and in return for which they have pledged to join their own resources to America 's for mutual defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as the faith that they will be put into offect whenever required . There is no doubt that the guarantees would lose their currency if the United States were to abandon West Berlin , Both American and West European officials ? are convinced that an overwhelming tide of neutralism and willingness to compromise on basic issues with the Soviet Union would surge around the world if the worth of American security pledges were sapped by welshing on West Berlin . The vital allied interests involved also are behind the objections of the American , Brit- , ish and French Governments to Communist-sponsored proposals , for solving the problem of Ger-1 many 's division . The two Germanys should confederate , say the Communists . Each should maintain its own political , social and economic systems and Berlin would become the seat of an all-German government . The Communists do not say it this way but the government would have such limited powers that it would hardly be a government at all , Little Support Some Germans are attracted by the proposal , but not those responsible for West German government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the point of view of allied interests , For whatever the Communists say now , the West German and allied officials are convinced that confederation would quickly be followed by an irresistible demand for the evacuation of foreign armies from Germany . The Russians would then go back a few miles to Poland and the Americans eventually all the way back to the United States . In short , a military vacuum would be created in the one place  --  Central Europe  --  where the United States , Britain and France are convinced that a vacuum must not be allowed to exist . Selwyn Lloyd , the British Foreign Secretary , finally said something openly in this week 's House of Commons foreign affairs debate that allied officials have been saying privately for many years , This is that the allies prefer a situation in Germany where East and West lean against each other , fully cognizant that in such proximity extra care must be taken to prevent accidents , A neutral belt in Central Europe , these officials believe , would only tempt adventurers . Until Premier Khrushchev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Western Europe believed that the Soviets were happy enough with the status quo in Germany , whatever Moscow might say for the public record . Now no one is sure , The Soviets are apparently willing to gamble in the belief that the cards are stacked in their favor . The West has held rigidly tot what , in the circumstances , is admittedly the most unlikely solution for Germany 's division : free elections to choose an all-German government , But there are powerful voices , both in West Germany and in allied capitals , that argue that one day what now seems a poor bet may suddenly become a winner . This view holds that Moscow ' may eventually be willing to concede East Germany ? and everyone knows that is what ' , free elections would mean ? 1 for political reasons now quite unpredictable . Russia 's suddenli willingness to evacuate Austria after years of intransigence is cited to support this view . No Other Way Seen No one pretends that the formula of free elections has ' any chance of acceptance now or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor , keeps repeating it and the United States keeps supporting him because ' in truth the West sees no other acceptable way of solving the ' problem . In the meantime . both , Dr. Adenauer and the Western tallies would like the status quo , ante Premier Khrushchev 's Nov. 10 speech on Berlin . But neither Dr. Adenauer nor ' the allied officials who ponder these problems are political simpletons . They know that whatever happens the situation in Berlin and West Germany is never going to be the same again , This leaves the question : What to do now ? The brutal , unpalatable truth is that they do not yet know . If there were a great groundswell for confederation or disengagement within German public opinion , the Chancellor might have to bend . But there is not , The voices that speak out for either represent a minority and the Chancellor can honestly say he is reflecting the majority 's opinion when he stubbornly refuses to consider either solution .               @ @ @ @ @ @
