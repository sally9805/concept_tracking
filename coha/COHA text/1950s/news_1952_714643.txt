txt Twenty thousand New Yorkers braved a steady rain yesterday to march down Fifth Avenue in the fifth annual Loyalty Day parade . Led for the first time by 1,000 Federal troops , the parade was an assertion by free men of their faith in democracy and their enmity toward the subject armies of communism , both in uniform and in the subversive 's mufti . The weather , however , was the equivalent of many Red divisions in holding back an army of spectators that had been estimated in advance at more than 1,000,000 . , Even so , the New Yorkers eventually broke through in slightly more than division strength ( the official estimate was 20,000 ) to line the police barriers along the route . After the last taxis and buses had hissed and splashed through the glistening avenue , the first marching units moved south from ) Ninety-fifth Street at 1 o'clock , into what appeared to be a no man 's land .

As they waited an occasional tentative trumpet note or drum beat was heard . A squad of mounted policemen stepped off first , the rhythmical clatter of their horses ' hooves doubling the beat of a drum in the First Army Band that followed . When the bands struck up the first martial air the crash of their music echoed down the side streets , drawing the advance elements of the umbrella sheltered crowds from the apartment houses and from the shops along Madison Avenue , a block to the east . One hundred First Army soldiers marched as an honor guard behind their band . They were followed by a company of Marines from the Brooklyn Marine Base . A band from the New Yorl- Naval Shipyard , Brooklyn , came next , leading a large detachment of white-legginged sailors . The final Armed Forces unit - vas from the !
