txt HARRrmAN , Y .. Aug. ** American Assembly came out today against a " rigid policy of permanent opposition " to the admission of Communist China to the United Nations . The Assembly ? composed of about sixty business , education and labor leaders and foreign policy specialists in the United States  --  made it clear Text of conclusions of 3-day Arden Conference. , Page 2. that it believed the Chinese , Communist regime should not be admitted " on the basis of facts as they now exist . " But in a declaration issued after a four-day series of talks here on international affairs , the Assembly added : " We note and deplore a tendency in the United States to adopt a rigid policy of permanent opposition under all circumstances to the seating of this regime . " The meeting that ended today was the fifth session of the American Assembly , founded in 1950 by President Eisenhower when he was head of Columbia University . The idea was to give prominent Americans in a variety of fields a chance to get together , exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans as a take-off point for more discussion and thought . Parley Lasted Four Days For . the last four days , members of the Assembly  --  bankers , industrialists , professors , union officials , journalists , clergymen and executives of non-profit foundations  --  have been talking about " the United States stake in the United Nations . " The meetings were held at Arden House , a huge stone mansion on a peak of the Ramapo Mountains , which was Averell Harriman 's gift to Columbia University . Chinese Communist representation in the United Nations was just one topic covered in the Arden House declaration . In the minds of many of the participants , one of the most interesting trends to develop in the meetings was a plain coolness toward the idea of calling a conference to revise the United Nations Charter . In the fall of 1955 , the General Assembly , will be asked to consider the calling of a conference to consider amendments to the Charter adopted in San Francisco in 1945 . John Foster Dulles , Secretary of State , has said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review talks . But the majority of the Ameri-1 can Assembly participants believed that the conference might do more harm than good . Their reasoning was that since the ' veto could kill proposed amendments and that since the East and the West were unlikely ' to agree on important changes , the conference would arouse hopes that would be doomed to disappointment . In its declaration , the Assembly said that the United States should wait until next year before making up its mind on the review conference . The statement added that if the majority of the // United Nations members wanted the talks , Washington should not actively oppose them .. A minority of the Assembly was in favor of the Charter review conference . A theme that ran through the declaration was that the United States should make the United , Nations a cornerstone of its for-1 eign policy , " in fact as well as in pious theory . " Despite Soviet obstructionism , the world organization remains an asset to the United States , the assembly , statement said . Like the conversations that preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nationalism and atomic energy . The drive for self-determination in Asia and Africa is so great as to amount almost to a revolution , the declaration said . Early Seif-Government Urged " It directly affects the security of the United States and of the whole world , " the declaration added . The Assembly members went on to make it clear that they believed the ? security inter , ests of the United States could best be served by pressing for speedy progress toward selfgovernment and that wherever possible specific timetables should be drawn up . In the field of atomic power , the declaration included a warning that nations " trembling under the threat of hydrogen weapons " could be pushed into neutrality if the United States was " unnecessarily provocative . " The relationship between United States security and the development of the United Nations also was ; emphasized in - the report .
