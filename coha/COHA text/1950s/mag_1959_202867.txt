Soon after the two dailies in Portland , Ore . started cash-prize crossword-puzzle contests last November , the entries were pouring in at a tidal rate-57,000 a week to the afternoon Oregon Journal ( circ. 182,956 ) , about 60.000 a week to the morning Oregonian ( circ. 233.856 ) . Few entrants knew of the prohibitive odds against winning such circulation-promotion contests : usually more than 100.000 to one. *Last week both Portland papers took to their front pages with embarrassed confessions that some of the winners had somehow reduced the odds against winning to zero . <P> " We have become convinced , " said the Oregonian , " that certain persons have had access to advance information regarding answers to some of the puzzles . " The Journal 's apology , which ran under a six-column head , offered more details : " Our investigations have shown beyond any doubt that at least one of our winning contestants was able to win $2,600 in prize money because of information supplied , through several Portland intermediaries , from persons operating in Detroit . " <P> Winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a tip that the next prizewinner would be a chiropractor 's wife . Sure enough . Mrs. Josephine Hill , a Portland chiropractor 's wife , won $2,600 , and finally told how she did it . Approached by a friend . Mrs. Hill agreed to have an entry submitted in her name-she did not even have to make it out . When it won . she banked $300 of the take and . as agreed , surrendered $2.300 to the friend-who turned it over to the fixer after subtracting $150 as an arranger 's fee . <P> Mrs. Hill was not the only fixed winner in the Journal contest . Another was Robert Alvich , 53 , a hotel desk clerk . A chronic puzzle contestant . Alvich bit on an anonymous telephone caller 's proposal to make him a cinch winner . Following orders , Alvich phoned Detroit , where another anonymous voice gave him the answer to the Journal 's current Cashword Puzzle . Sure enough , Alvich won $2,950 and . still following instructions , wired $2,000 to one " Harry Valk ' ' in Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eager " ) Beaver , admitted that he had been similarly set up to win $1,700 from the Oregonian , had also sent the lion 's share of the loot to Detroit . <P> After reporters clearly established that the fix was on . the Portland papers called in the police and the FBI . In Detroit authorities learned that " Harry Valk " was Harry H. Balk , a shadowy freelance booking agent who had not only collected the prize money wired from Portland but had won $4,400 on his own last December in a puzzle contest in the Chicago American . Last week Balk was hibernating in Brooklyn . The probability that the fix was bigger than Balk arose when Robert F. Kennedy , counsel for the U.S. Senate rackets committee , disclosed that racketeers had attempted to bribe a committee witness by guaranteeing to fix a win for him in a newspaper puzzle contest . <P> One Guilty Defendant . As the Portland story clattered over the press wires , many another newspaper began to turn a wary eye on puzzle contests .
