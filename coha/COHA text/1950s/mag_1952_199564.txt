Back in 1934 when Dr. Hjalmar Schacht was Hitler 's financial boss , he had a law put on the statutes which ruled out of the banking profession anyone whose financial expertness or solvency was questionable , or who had " insufficient honor . " The law helped the Nazis take over Germany 's banking system . A month ago , Schacht , now a persimmon-faced 75 , survivor of the Nrnberg war criminal trials and of denazification courts , asked the Hamburg Central State Bank for a license to establish an import-export bank under the name Hjalmar Schacht &; Co. ( capital : 1,000,000 Deutsche marks ) . Last week the decision was in . The Hamburg senate had refused Schacht his license , under the old 1934 law . Grounds : " insufficient honor .
