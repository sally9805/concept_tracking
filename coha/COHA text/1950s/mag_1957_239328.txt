RAILROADS The Devil &; Dan'l Webster On a preinaugural demonstration of his new , light , low-gravity-center train , New Haven President George Alpert last week savored the unaccustomed compliments of 225 guests , mostly newsmen , along for the ride . The Dan'l Webster , a nine-car , $1,500,000 train , powered by low-slung diesel locomotives fore and aft , was noticeably smoother and quieter than standard equipment though it cost only $1,650 per seat v. $2,850 for the conventional type . As the train from Boston rolled into the outskirts of Manhattan , it was right on time-in itself a subject for congratulations on the oft-late New Haven. * But suddenly the devil got into the Dan'l Webster . A balky cast-iron shoe on the rear diesel rubbed on the third rail , started a fire that stopped the train in its tracks . After 25 minutes the fire was subdued , and so was President Alpert . Said he , as the Dan'l Webster moved into Grand Central Terminal . 55 minutes late : " If this train had proceeded another five or six miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't and I 'm not . " Later , as the damaged engine and two cars made their way to the repair shop , the devil had another go . One of the cars jumped the rails , blocked the tracks , held up 29 outbound trains up to half an hour . <P> <P> - Since Alpert took over last January ( TIME , Jan. 30 ) , passenger trains have improved their on-time record from 84.6% to 94.2%.
