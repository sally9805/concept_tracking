THE WALL ( 632 pp. ) - John Mersey-Knopf ( $4 ) . <P> The wall of John Hersey 's title is the one built by the Germans around Warsaw 's Jewish quarter during their wartime occupation ; his story is the slow extermination of the people caught inside it ; his theme the breaking down of the self-built wall of passive meekness which has so long enclosed European Jewry in the invisible prison of the ghetto mind . <P> Warsaw 's Jews first thought that the Nazis ' coming meant " no more than a switch of anti-Semitic rulers . The book describes their slow wakening to the realities of race murder as the Germans first wall them in , then wipe them out , block by block . At its opening the trapped Jews are living normal city lives ; at its close they can take a crying baby from its mother 's breast and kill it , for fear of the Germans who are searching for hidden survivors . The book ends , symbolically , with a group of ghetto men , liberated from their trap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting partisan , in the open country far outside the city . <P> Wrath &; Terror . Unhappily , Author Hersey chooses to tell the story in novel form , and employs one of the oldest and least effective technical tricks for giving fiction the authentic tang of fact : he pretends that he is merely the editor of papers written by Eyewitness Noach Levinson . This gabbiest of notetakers is supposed to have lived out the days of wrath and terror pen in hand , documenting the horror minute by minute , until he had built up a jumbo collection of manuscript and clippings filling 17 iron boxes and a number of parcels . These he buried before slipping away through the city 's sewers as the Germans finally closed in . The improbability of this archive , in the circumstances , is stressed by an introduction in which Author Hersey tries to establish the reality of Chronicler Noach . Publisher Knopf , seemingly fearful that some readers might believe every word of it , prints a brief introduction to the introduction , pointing out that the " ' archive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the convincing qualities of a three-dollar bill to what actually is an account of one of the great tragedies of modern Europe . <P> Author Hersey makes a point of his editorial integrity in letting his character Noach have his own say in his own way , but an editor really on the job would have cut the story by a third or quarter to make it that much more direct and that much more moving . As it stands , gabby Noach. too introspective to give a clear account of action , and too intellectual to understand the urgent , passionate movements of the human heart , bores the reader into indifference . An effective criticism of the book and evidence of one character 's sound common sense appears on the next-to-last page : " Rachel has been trying to get me to stop writing . But I have some more to put down . Is this the second day ? The third day ? I have been writing steadily . There is a kind of fog at the edges of my field of vision . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind befogged Noach 's thick-lensed spectacles long before , to show his readers Warsaw seen through his own clear eyes .
