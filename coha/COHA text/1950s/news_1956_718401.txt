txt Letters to The Times MILTON M. BERGERMANWILLIAM HENRY CHAMBERLIN.DAVID G. SALTENWILLIAM J. BARNES , ... Letters to The Times TO TILE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : We in the Citizens Union value the hospitality of The Times columns , which has been a great help to us in our civic work . We also welcome criticism . In your editorial of Dec. 5 , however , commenting on our bills to control concessions on public property , it seems to us that you have dismissed an important matter rather lightly and on dubious grounds . To begin with , we have a Board of Estimate which is responsible for the proper ma.pagement of the city 's affairs , and a city planning commission which is charged with the task of doing intelligent planning . The Tavern on the Green episode disclosed the fact that there was a large area of official activity in relation to the fiscal affairs and the proper planning of the city that never came before these bodies . Our bills are designed to remedy that defect . Political Considerations The objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city would put decisions relating to public property in the realm of politics is remarkable . The argument that the elected public officials should not be permitted to supervise certain areas of public affairs because it involves putting those affairs into politics would necessarily mean , carried to its logical conclusion , that the handling of all public property should be taken out of the hands of the Board of Estimate , where most of it now rests , and be given over to individuals who could function without public scrutiny or interference . The Citizens Union prefers to have the property and affairs of the city remain in the hands of the Board of Estimate , as the Charter provides . The press makes great efforts to keep the public informed . It rightly criticizes public officials who try to conduct their activities in camera . Our bills simply propose to put public actions on the public record , where everybody , including the reporters , can see them . Even a good official should not be a law unto himself , and even the best officials can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that you would agree that it would have been better for everyone concerned if the proposal for an enlarged parking lot for the Tavern on the Green had been presented to the Board of Estimate . I should assume you would also agree that the whole Tavern on the Green operation , involving hundreds of thousands of dollars which the city indirectly pays , should have been examined by the board . At least , we think so . Safeguards Questioned You say that " major questions of policy are already under proper safeguard . Where were the safeguards on this occasion and what are they at present ? It took quite an uproar in the press to bring the financial and other aspects of this affair into the open . As for your point that our bills would impose a great burden on the Board of Estimate , I believe you will find that there is no cause for alarm . In the great majority of cases minor concessions will simply be listed on Board of Estimate calendars and disposed of in bulk , as is now the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there , however , for inspection by the public and the press , and an alert reporter may occasionally discover something , even in relation to such matters as " bootblack stands and candy carts , " that calls for a second look . MILTON BERGERMAN Chairman , Citizens Union of the City of New York . New York , Dec , 6 , 1956 , Our Attitude on Nasser To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES : It is unfortunately true , as your editorial of Dec. 6 states , that " it is not to President Nasser 's advantage , judging from his record , to see peace in , the Middle East , to see an accommodation with Israel , to see the Suez Canal opened for free international use . " Does this statement not effort of this Government during November to put Nasser back " stronger than ever " as a result of the enforced unconditional withdrawal of British , French and Israeli forces ? WIr.LrAM HENRY CH AmBERLIN , Cambridge , Mass. , Dec. 6 , 1936 . State School Bonds To THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levitt's. statement that interest on school building bonds is excessive because our present system of marketing these securities is archaic and obsolete deserves careful study by every citizen interested in the welfare of our schools . In Nassau County , for example , the interest rate on school bonds has risen from 3.28 per cent to 4.17 per cent in the last six months . School construction can not he postponed for a more favorable market . Hence the debt service of school districts in the years ahead will be consuming millions of dollars which should be going into teachers ' salaries and the building of new classrooms . School bonds in this state are a safe investment , and , since their come is tax-free , ought to be hig marketable at rates well belov per cent . However , if the finan , ratings of local school districts , not high enough to attract invest ' , the faith and credit of the et should be placed behind these sc rities . Mr. Levitt , as the state 's cl fiscal officer , may be reluctant suggest a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirms the principle t the welfare of our school childrei the responsibility of all the people our state . DAVID G. SALTED Superintendent of Schools , Li Beach . Long Beach , N. Y. , Dec. 7 , 1956 , Red China in U. N. Oppos ' Present Era Portends Swing Av From Hate , It Is Felt To THE EDITOR Of THE NEW YORK Tim The editorials and letters in ' I New York Times recently dealt with the China situation as it lates to the United States hI seemed to me to be very importa However , while we theorize ab the present problem it may be w to recall to mind one or two aspe , of its earlier development . The " Hate America " program China is only a little over ten ye old . It was generated by the Co monists and has been furiously * veloped and pushed by them . was a fictitious , synthetic prods from the start , but in this sit ( time its evil odor has so permeat the Asiatic scene as to be accept by many people as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the fall of 1946 a pla American man , wearing no unifor except plain American clothes , alone , could go about his busine in China , in the middle of the id ; or in the middle of the night , I city streets or country paths , bus or train or river boat or ai plane , in home or shop or gover : ment office  --  that he could go an ; where , except in Communist-col trolled territory , in complete safel and respect , because he was a American . Document of Hate After three months of such tray el , from Peiping ? in the north t Canton in the south , I was unpre pared to look at the first documer of hate to be brought to my atter tion . It was a poster that had bee thrown over a hospital compoun wall near the Communist fringe i the dark of night . It depicted th United States as a diabolic monste wallowing through a helpless thron ; of tortured Chinese women and chit dren . It was a hideous caricature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as crude a distor tion of current history as anything we are seeing in Hungary now , an ( it has continued to be one of thi main tools of the party now in con. trol of mainland China . It it ravishment . of truth . It seems apparent now that mankind is making its most serious effort to discredit military force a.0.1 a substitute for law and justice . Al the same time we are witnessing s revolt whose significance can scarcely be exaggerated , a revolt against treachery and deceit and distortion of fact as prescribed ways of Government . Who knows how widely and deeply this revolt is moving ? Balance on Brutality . The hope of this effort and of this revolt is embodied in the United Nations . The balance in the United Nations , in this new , this post ! Hungary era , is not asking for accretion to the side of brutality and lying hatefulness . There may be academic reasons for admitting the Communist Chi. , nese regime to the United Nations . There are hundreds of millions a human reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Communist hell , and in other lands where they do not wish to suffer it directly in order to learn communism 's true nature . WILLIAM J. BARNES . M. D. Great Barrington , Mass. , Nov. 30 , 1956 . To Cancel Office Parties To TH E EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : For all of us here in the United States this is a season of steadily increasing joy and excitement . For hundreds of thousands of ill-fed refugees in Austria and many , many war-stricken people in Hungary huddled together in inadequate clothing , the season will not be as gay . That is why , this year , I suggest that businesses in New York vote not to hold their usual office parties , Instead , it would seem znost appro. priate to give the money which would have been spent to Red Cross for Hungarian relief .
