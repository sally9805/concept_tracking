What do U.S. audiences really think of the big names of television ? After interviewing 400 families , Chicago 's Social Research , Inc. this week published its findings , embellished by some marginal notes of its own . Items : <P> Milton Berle is " acknowledged to be the king of TV entertainers , but he is not universally liked by his subjects , " many of whom think him " an extreme egotist " and " rude . " His humor " does tend to emphasize physical action , " and " the viewer feels uncomfortable when Berle is obnoxious and gets applause for it . . . In summary , Berle violates a major value of American society-that of self-control . " <P> Ken Murray relies on a single , tried &; true formula . " In contrast to the changing orientations of most variety shows , the major theme of the show is sex . Emphasis is placed on the glamor of the girls , Ken Murray makes cracks with sexy overtones . . . The audience has no strongly formed loyalty to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some others-but likes him as a relaxed and amusing guy . . . The sexual-musical combination is appealing , perhaps especially so on Saturday night , the universal ' dating ' time . . . " <P> Arthur Godfrey is a favorite of " the Middle Majority woman who will seldom admit publicly or individually that she enjoys any form of ' crudity , ' and will say that Godfrey 's wit is n't up to her moral standards . . . . In the morning , with no one in her home to be shocked , she can wholeheartedly join in on the studio laughter and fun . At night , with the husband and children around , she is n't so free but she still enjoys it . " <P> Ted Mack ( The Original Amateur Hour ) " In contrast to Milton Berle , Arthur Godfrey , and Bert Parks . . . he is an eminently serious person who communicates to the audience a feeling of the importance , usefulness and rightness of his program . Respondents ' references to him are quite reminiscent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach , Scout leader or father . " <P> Many televiewers , the survey concludes , are a little ashamed of their taste in entertainment . They are " proud to appreciate entertainment that has a ' seal of approval ' from people with prestige-a pride that is probably a bit elevated because it is frequently pointed out to them that they spend more time watching TV than is quite respectable . " <P> * Translation : the average housewife .
