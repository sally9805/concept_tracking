txt Four years ago we would hardly have wagered a plugged nickel on the chances that the nations of Western Europe would join in making that continent a single trading area . The obstacle was not the inability of many statesmen to see the advantages of it . The idea was embodied , in a small way , in the Schuman plan which did unite six nations in the production of coal and steel . It was an idea discussed by economists for half a century and talked of by politicians at least since the days of World War II . The obstacle lay in ancient economic rivalries . One of the inevitable consequences of free trade is that various industries gravitate to the places where they can perform their functions most efficiently , and while this is to the ultimate benefit of all areas it does tend to cause the dislocation of many local industries . Yet within the past year the mood has changed dramatically . Britain will not commit itself but it is no longer obstructing . And the French Assembly is now completing debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic federation . One , the treaty to establish a European nuclear pool , has practically no opposition ; it has the advantage of starting from scratch in a new field where there are as yet no vested interests . The other treaty , to create a common European market without tariff barriers , will find harder sledding ; it must overcome the opposition of delegates who fear that the local in- , dustries of their provinces might be injured . We would still wager that any real economic union of Western Europe is still a long way off . Nevertheless , French political reporters think a miracle is going to happen  --  that both these treaties will be approved . If they are , that will indeed be progress . And even if the Assembly rejects the economic treaty at this time , the atothic treaty alone will be a step forward . On a long journey progress is sometimes discouragingly slow . But that 's all the more reason to watch for each passing milestone.               @ @ @ @ @ @
