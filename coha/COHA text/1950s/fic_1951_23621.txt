Bush Boy , Poor Boy A Story by James Aldridge Drawings by Lou Block 0 NcE , there were two things that were worth while doing in life . One was to shoot a fox , the other to catch a twenty-pound cod . At one time these achievements were so important to me that I abandoned everything else in life to pursue them . Why , I could n't exactly say , but the reason began somewhere in the difference between myself  --  a bush boy and a poor boy , and young Tom Woodley who was a town boy and a rich boy . There it began ; but in the way of life , it became something quite different to me in the effort to achievement . I lived with my father , a woodcutter , on the Murray River , three or four miles outside the town of St. Helen , Victoria . The truth is , I did n't know much about anything except the bush , whereas young Tom Woodley was a clever boy with everything he touched : school , playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , and that included the teachers and the policeman . Where Tom was the best of everything , I was the worst of it , except in the bush . Every boy in town had something he could laugh at me about , but once they came out of the town and along the river , I could beat them all : that is until young Tom Woodley came out to the river in his father 's Model-T Ford on a picnic and within an hour had shot a fox with a .22 rifle and pulled in a fifteen-pound Murray cod on a line . These were things that I , a bush boy , had never achieved . I had caught amazing quantities of fish , and I had even caught a Murray cod of ten pounds ; but never anythinglarger . When I could get the ammunition , I had shot large numbers of rabbits , in fact I almost lived by selling rabbit skins ; yet I had never once been able to get a fox in range . With Tom Woodley I knew it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good because I knew that I had nothing to stand up to now , nothing at all ; and I stopped going into the town altogether , in fact I even stopped going to school , and I stayed in the bush , determined to catch a twenty-pound cod and shoot a fox before facing the laughter of the boys in shoes and the joking of men behind counters . T HE fox was the more difficult proposition , and yet the day came when I was to stand near enough to a fox to club it to death , if only I had been big enough to do it . It was really an accident . For once I was not hunting or fishing , but looking for mushrooms . I was on Pental Island , which was covered in lagoons and swamps and dry patches and clumps , and as I was walking through a fish shallow pool , I came out on a small dry rise with one clumpy bush on it . I was picking mushrooms under the bush when I saw the fox . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . He was more afraid of the water than he was of me . He backed away from the bush , and I backed away from him . The dry land we shared was only about thirty feet square , and he was less than ten yards away ; but here I was without a gun and there was the fox , standing with his tail up and his teeth bared , but not making a sound . I stepped slowly back into the water . I could n't do anything without a gun and I knew it would take me an hour to get home : I had to swim a river and then go over a mile through the hush . Even so , I knew that thisfox would stay right where he was . 1 knew foxes ; and I knew that this one was terrified of the water and would die before he would move into it . So I put down the mushrooms I had collected in a sugar bag , and got through the pool and started to run for home . At home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't have it with me was my lack of ammunition ; and as I ran I begged myself to think of a place where I could find just one shell : no more . As I ran I thought of the .22 shell I had lost last year in the woodpile . That was no good . I had tried a dozen times before to find it . I could not borrow any , and there were n't any shells in all the drawers in the house : I had searched them time and time before . I was running for nothing , but I did n't stop . I ran through the high grass and came to the river . I jumped off the point and swam across the deep hole and waded the rest . Then I ran up the high bank , through the willow trees , and made for home . I got home and started to hunt in the woodpile , raking up the chips with my hands and feet , still panting and puffing from the run . I could n't find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , so I went desperately into the house . I looked in the chamber of my rifle , but it was empty : I had known , but I had hoped . Then I knew there was only one thing to do . My father was away cutting wood , so I went into his room and got the .303 that hung on the wall . It was so big that I could hardly carry it , but I lifted it down . It had a clip of three shells in the magazine . It was clean , but it had n't been fired for years . My father would n't even fire it himself , and the shells were in it in case of emergency . I took it down and carried it outside . This was the worst thing I could do . I was not allowed to touch this gun , not to touch it at all . But I did n't care now . I put the heavy .303 over my shoulder like a log , and started to run back with it . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone far . Still , I kept running in spasms , I walked and ran , and when I got to the river I nearly sank trying to keep the gun out of water . I could n't hold it up , and it was well dipped by the time I got across . I covered the distance from the river to the lagoon very slowly . I was starting to shake inside , puffing in and out ; but I managed to run the last hundred yards to the BUSH BOY , swamp and the pool . I looked across the twenty-five yards of water to the island , and at the same time I pulled back the bolt of the .303 and put a shell in the chamber . Then I waded across to kill my fox . But the fox had gone . I kicked the bush and looked into it , looking for a hole or a warren , but there was nothing at all , except a few droppings and a feather . He had gone and that was that . I could understand how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place : a quick break in the lagoon had obviously flooded the land around him as he slept on the rise ; that was clear enough ; but I could n't see how he could get off , knowing his terror of water . I started to hunt on the other dry patches , and then on the whole dry land . It was hopeless . So I went home with my mushrooms and the .303 . I got a hiding with a harness strap for taking the .303 , because I could n't give any explanation of why I had taken it . I did not try to tell the truth : I simply made up a long story about chasing a wild pig . My father said there were no wild pigs in the whole country . I knew that too , but I got the hiding anyway . I went back looking for that fox the next day and thereafter . I kept looking ; and though I was eventually looking for any fox , it was always the same fox to me . I kept looking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night I wept for a couple of hours in bed for the mystery and the difficulty of it all , and the next day I went back to fishing for a twenty-pound cod . T - HERE were a number of places along the Little Murray River which were good for cod , and I knew them all . The best was at Old Roy Carmichael 's . Roy had a house which he had built of a boiler . Outside ( near the river ) there was a gate he had taken from some old church , but there was n't any fence . On the gate there was a latch that said IN and OUT . Roy always put it on the right one if he was in or out . He had built mud steps down to the water 's edge , and as the river rose in winter and went down in summer , Roy would mark the height on the steps with an iron peg . I used this peg to hold my rod as I fished for cod , and old Roy himself came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mussel on a hook . " Why do n't you use worms ? " he asked me . " I 've used up just about every worm in the countryside , " I told him . " What about the Council 's pig yard ? " old Roy asked . " I ca n't go up there , " I said . " I got caught digging under the stone floor . " Roy was thin and old . He had a gray mustache that dropped right over his mouth . Sometimes he laughed for no reason at all , and he laughed now . " How is your father , Edgar ? " he bellowed at me . " He went into town to sell some wood , " I told him . " How do you like it when they laugh at him in town ? " Roy said . I did n't know Ivhat to say to that , so I asked him why he lived in the boiler . " I lived over it for twenty years , " he said . " Now I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into a river boat . They do n't make them like it any more . If she had n't hit the Point , the old Rang Dang would he going yet , with that boiler still inside her . " I knew all about it . The old Rang Dang was a paddle steamer which had tried to come up the Little Murray . It had hit low ground at the Point and sunk . Old Roy had been the Captain of it . He had waited around to try and get the Rang Dang up from bottom , but the boat had fallen apart , so he had only saved the boiler . He had stayed right there and lived in the boiler . That was a long time ago . I had asked him once why he did n't get another boat . He had picked up a dead sunflower and thrown it at me , so I had n't asked him again . My father , Edgar Allan , had told me that he could n't get another boat anywhere after that . They , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hit the Point . After that Roy never drank , just to prove that he had not been drunk at the time . " You know that 's a two-inch boiler , " he said to me now . " It looks thick enough , " I said . - " It has n't got a flaked spot in it . Come on up . I 'll show you . " I had been through this before , but I hooked my rod under a stone and went up with him . He passed the gate and put it to IN . He opened the heavy metal fire-door and bent down to get inside . The boiler was filled with a number of things , mostly made from old petrol tins . It had a floor of wood and there were all sorts of clocks with bodies made of tins . There were flower pots in tins with curled-over edges , a cut-out tin was set in as fireplace , and the bed was made of kerosene tins framed together . Everything was painted red . On one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get into the extension he had built . You could still see all the holes where the pipes had been . Old Roy gave me a sledge hammer . " Go on , " he said . " Hit it . Hit it anywhere you like . " I did n't like doing it . When I hit , everything fell down from the shelves . He insisted . " Hit it anywhere ! " I found a clear spot , gripped my bare feet on the floor , and swung the sledge hammer as best I could , upward . It bounced off the iron side , and everything rattled down . " Harder ! " Roy shouted . " Anywhere ! " I hit the side harder this time , in the same place . " How old are you ? " old Roy said . He was angry . " Eleven , " I told him . " Ca n't you hit harder than that ? " " There 's no room , " I said . " There has to be room , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaked spot and you do n't hit hard enough ? A head of steam hits it and the whole lot blows to smithereens . Give it to me . Look . " Old Roy swung the hammer up onto a plate . The whole place shook and the tins rattled . He hit it again in another place . Everything fell down and clattered about Roy kicked everything aside and walked to the back and hit it there . He kept hitting it until he was too tired to do it any more . " You see , " he said . " Not a flake . " He was shaking ; he was an old man . " What about everything on the floor ? " I pointed to the mess . " Junk ! " he said . " The only thing worth while around here is the boiler . " We went out then and back to the mud steps . " What are you fishing for ? " he asked me . " A big cod , " I told him . " Twenty-pounder . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , but I 'm after a big cod . " And I told Roy about Tom Woodley and the fox and the cod . " Have you been getting any cod lately ? " I asked . " No . Perch . That 's all there is in this river . Yellow bellies . " " Fish are fish , " I said . " Why do n't you go over to the Big Murray ? " " The river is still too high to swim . " " I 'll take you over in the boat . " " No thanks , " I said very quickly . Roy had taken me over once before , saying he would pick me up when I came back , if I shouted to him . I had come back and shouted , and he had n't come . He had forgotten all aboui me . The river had been too high and fast to swim , so I had stayed on Pental Island all night , getting a hiding when I went home the next clay . " I 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting sick of the taste of perch . " " All right , " I said . Roy went to get some lines and the oars to his boat . His boat was always tied up here at the steps . He had built it himself , and it was the best small-boat on the river . Roy came down and looked at my rod and said : " What do you want a rod for ? A line is better for cod : they are like elephants : they catch themselves . " " I like a rod , " I said . I liked to fish with a rod . If I caught that twenty-pounder I wanted to catch it on a rod . " Leave it behind , " Roy said . " It 's all right . I want to take it . " Roy siiouted : " Whatever-your-name-is , leave that rod behind ! " I stood there and did n't get into the boat . " Are you coming or are n't you ? " Roy shouted . He was red in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get in , " he said . " Get in . Bring the rod . What do I care . You 're like the rest of them . You can laugh at me ! Get in . Do you hear me ! " He was shouting at the top of his voice , and he shouted and swore all the way over . As we went across we were carried downstream by the current , but Roy knew exactly where it would take him . He had another set of steps on the Pental Island side of the river , and we landed right on them . Pental Island was between the two rivers , BUSH BOY , the Big Murray and the Little Murray . The Little Murray came out of the Big Murray twenty miles upstream , it wandered about , then it came back to the big river just below Roy 's place .. There was a clump of gums where the two rivers joined , and that was where we were going now . On the way I told him about the fox on the dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought had happened to it . " Did you ever see a fox chased by a snake ? " he said . " No , " I said . " That 's it , " Roy said . " That 's it , Edgar . He was scared off by a snake . " " If he was n't scared off by me , he was n't scared off by a snake . " " I tell you it was a snake . " Roy got angry again . " They are more afraid of snakes than of you . " I did n't believe it . At the timber we walked straight through to the deep hole under a hanging gum . Cod were always in the deep holes . Bream were on sandbanks . Perch were in backwaters . Fishing for perch you used a float ; but for cod and bream you fished on the bottom , with two hooks above the sinker . " You can take the dead tree , " Roy said . This was the best place . thanked him , but it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast his line near mine and then come around by me and talk . He did n't believe that noise scared off the fish . " Have you ever seen a fish with ears ? " he used to say . When I said , " No , " he would say , " Well how the devil can they hear ? If they could hear they could talk , or bark . Have you ever heard them talk ? " " No , " 1 would say , " but I 've heard them bark . " " You 're a liar , Edgar , " he would say . " How can a fish bark ? It has n't any ears . " Now I walked out on the dead tree and sat on a fork . Half of the dead tree was in the water . I could drop the line straight down into the hole ; but I like to cast a bit . I baited with mussels , let about a yard of fine hang on the end of the rod , put my thumb on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinker flew out , taking the line ; and it plunked down right where I wanted it . Roy undid a heavy cord line from a stick , baited it , and whirled it over his head and threw it . The bolt which acted as a sinker plunked down very near mine : too near . I jumped , because I believe noise frightens fish . We sat quietly for a while , and I held the line lightly , waiting for bites . Then Roy got up and walked over to the tree and came out on it . " Why do n't you go to school ? " he said to me . " It is too far away , " I said . " School is never too far away , " he said . " You could walk . " " It takes too long , " I said . " Two hours . " " What are two hours ! Can you read and write ? " " Yes , " I said . I could read very little . I could hardly write . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when they asked me that , but I did n't like saying , " No . " " That 's not enough , " Roy Carmichael said . " You have to know about figures and some history . " " I know , " I said . " I would like to know about them . " " Yes . You ought to go to Castle Donning-ton school . " " I used to go , " I told him , " but Miss Gillespie sent me home . " " What for ? " Roy was angry straight away . " She said I was pretty dirty ; and I did n't have any books . It was n't any good having them . I used to swim the river to save time , and I accidentally dropped the books in the river near the Point one day . They were no good when I got them up . It 's funny she thought I was dirty : I had to swim the river every day . " " What does it matter if you 're dirty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only clean people are ? The drapers and butchers . The ones in the bank , and the dentists . You know who the best boys are at that school , Edgar ? " he said . " No , " I said thinking about the fish . " The little bleeders of the drapers and the butchers . Do you know what they grow up to be ? " " No , " I said . " Drapers and butchers . I 've watched them . They are the ones for schools . The dirty faces can go to Hades . You can go to Hades . If I was a boy I could go to Hades . I am the only man alive who can take a boat up the Little Murray , but I could go to Hades . The ones that can sell you a pair of drawersand keep their necks clean , they 're the ones . If I had a boat , I would teach you to take it up the Little Murray . I 'm the only man alive that can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy knew what he did , but I told him : " He carts wood , " I said . " Is that a reason for a town to belittle a man ? " Roy said . I did n't care about that . I was getting small bites , nibbles . I could imagine the fish just pulling on the side of the bait , tearing it away without touching the hook , so I waited . Then it all happened . " Look at your line , " I said to Roy . He looked over to the bank , and the willow springer to which he had tied his line had been pulled clean out of the bank , and was tight in the water . Before he could leave me , I felt a big pull  --  a tremendous pull  --  on my own rod , and I jerked it up to hook the fish ; but the rod bent and nearly broke , and I knew I had my big one . " You 've hooked my line , " Roy shouted in my ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on mine , " I cried back as I held onto the rod , almost falling into the water , just hanging on . " No , " Roy said . " You 've hooked my line . Give me the rod . " He was dancing up and down , his face was red , and his hair was aloft . " You 'll lose my line , you 're pulling it in . You 'll lose the fish . " I did n't have time to look around at Roy 's line . I was trying to hang onto the fish that had hold of mine , and at the same time keep Roy from taking my rod away from me . " What 's the matter with you ! " Roy said and got a good grip on my rod . " Let it go , will you . I 'll break it on your back . " The fish pulled , the rod bent , Roy and I held onto it . Then Roy swung his arm and knocked me clean off the log into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out he was reeling in the fish and walking back to the bank to land it . I ran over and tried to get the rod back , but he pushed me away and landed the fish . It was a Murray-cod all right , and it was more than twenty pounds . It was fat and gasping and kicking as Roy whipped it right up the bank away from the water . I ran up to get hold of the line . I could see already who had caught it . " It was on my hook , it was on my line , " I cried at Roy , and I was really crying . " You caught my fish . " It had been Roy 's line that had tangled with mine : it was his that had ruined this catch . " You caught my fish , " was all I could shout at him . " What 's the matter with you ? " Roy said , and I thought he was going to hit me again . " I got the fish out , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have fallen in the hole , you would have lost it . " " You got my fish , " I said . " That 's the fish I 've been waiting to catch . " " Well you caught it , " Roy said and put his foot on the cod to take out the hook . " I did n't catch it , " I said . " You did ! " " It was on your line , " he said . He was laughing now . " What 's the good of that ! You pulled it in . You caught it . You took it away from me . You caught my fish . " " Well , you can have it , " Roy said . " I do n't want it . I just wanted to catch it . " " Well , damn it , you caught it . You can say you caught it . I wo n't deny it . " " That 's no good , " I cried . " Tom Woodley caught his fifteen-pounder . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was practically screaming at I knew that I would have little of ever again catching another and long . Roy got mad again and threw a clod at me . " You stole my fish , " I said from a distance , to insult . " Take your fish ! " he shouted . " I do n't want it , " I said , and then I ran . I tried to get Roy 's boat out and back across the river , but I beached it on some shallows and Roy caught me and took it over and laughed at me all the way across . Then he held onto me , on the other side , and I said I 'd never get a fish like that and neverget a fox . Never again . I was finished now , and Roy knew it , and he hung onto me and told me he would let the world know I had caught that fish ; and moreover he would help me get that fox . He had ammunition and a fOx whistle , and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish again . Then he let me go . " Do n't you want your rod ? " he called after me as I went . " Keep it , " 1 shouted back and swore at him again . He threw it at me , and I ran away cursing and shouting , leaving my rod , and leaving the big Murray-cod that should have been mine . That cod was mine , and I knew it . Yet not having it , and not having caught it , the thing began to overwhelm me . It was always on my mind , from the moment I lost it , and before long it had become something that I had but could . never have : something I had achieved yet could never achieve . The puzzle and mystery of this was even worse than the mystery of the disappearing fox , and if I 'd wept a little in bewilderment over that , this time I had nightmares that made terror of incidents I had long since forgotten . All of them were puzzles , and all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something so much , to have almost had it , and then to have lost it at the moment of success . It made me sick , and it seemed that I was never in peace again . More and more the necessity of killing that fox became a way to solve these things and give me back a day without thought and a night without terror . That fox was the fulfillment somehow , and I knew I had to achieve it or be miserable forever . T HEN late in summer Roy gave me my chance . He found me one day on Perna ! Island , and after he had boxed my ears for taking a revenge shot at his fox terrier , he began to laugh at me . " Are you still bawling and howling about that fish ? " he said to me . I had n't forgiven him even then for that fish . He had certainly told the town I had caught it ( a twenty-eight-pounder ) , and he had thus half-saved me from Tom Woodley and the town boys ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't caught it , and be-cause my sudden nightmare and its life-puzzle would n't let me go , and I blamed him for that too . I would n't talk to him about that fish , but he laughed and did n't care , so I did n't care , and I told him I would call the next day and get my rod back . " Do you still want that fox , Edgar ? " he asked me . " Yes , but I want to get it myself , " I told him . " Do n't be such a moaner , " he said . " And if you do want a fox , you come down here tomorrow morning before daybreak and I 'll show you where you can get one . " " Where is he ? " I asked Roy . I did n't trust him now . " You come down tomorrow morning and I 'll show you , " he shouted . " You 'll show me where it is , and then you 'll shoot it yourself , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me with a red face . He seemed very upset , and I was sorry . " You come down here tomorrow morning before light and I 'll take you over and get you that fox ! D' you hear ! " " All right , " I said , because he seemed desperate about it . I do n't think I slept at all that night , because I knew that Roy would really show me a fox , and within shooting range . By now , hunting the fox had become habit , even though it was still the most vital thing in my life  --  the one solution and the one satisfaction to the puzzle and inconsistency of each day and each thing . I just did n't know where I stood these days , and more and more all things had become a puzzle to me because of the loss of that cod . Perhaps it was my own doing now , because I could always set off on a blind and hopeless route of thought by asking a few questions about myself , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinge , a piece of wood . All I had to do was look at anything and ask myself what it was and where it came from and what had brought it to this state and where would it go , and all the nightmare of the lost Murray-cod would return . Yet on this night I knew it would end , because tomorrow I would hunt that fox , shoot it , achieve the simple aim , finish this whole puzzle , and go back to normal again . That was tomorrow . I was over at Roy 's long before light , and I had to kick on the boiler door to wake himup . He told me to go away and leave him in peace , but I kept on kicking the door and he finally got up . He gave me a piece of cold meat to eat , and we rowed across to Pental Island . Roy knew Pental Island even better than I did , because he had a trap-line all over it , and he covered it almost every day . We emptied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had me carrying the rabbits on my shoulder as he walked ahead . " Do n't make so much noise , " he said to me as we climbed a little hill . The rabbits were hitting my back , and their bellies were making a rolling and rumbling sound . " Drop those things and keep quiet , " lie said in a whisper . Roy did n't creep , as I would in hunting . He walked upright , but he walked very carefully and slowly , stopping absolutely still from time to time and then moving on again . I moved behind him , doing what he did , and holding my .22 loaded and ready . When we reached the dry red top of the hill , which was bare and round , Roy lay down carefully and put his head over the top . It was still dark , but light was breaking the sky . " Down there , " Roy whispered and pointed to a clump of three or four sphinx bushes , " is a fox Warren . That old fox is sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Of course you ca n't , " Roy growled between his teeth . " He 'll be coming out when the sun comes up . Can you hit him from here ? " It was about fifty feet down to the clump , and if the fox was n't running I knew I could hit him . " Leave him to me , " I said because I did n't want Roy to interfere . He had a .22 himself , and he held it ready for use . " Well , keep your mouth closed and your feet still , " Roy said , " and wait ; and when you see him come right out , let him have it . " We waited , and I had a feeling now that this was all right . It was simple enough to be lying here , it was simple enough for anything in life at all . The sun would rise , the fox would come out , I would shoot , and life would again be normal . I had never felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I looked at Roy and cocked a grin . I was forgiving him the cod . " Keep your eye on that bush , " Roy whispered angrily . I watched the bush and watched the horizon . The sky became pink , the mist rose , the crows flew high , and the kookaburras laughed ; and then came the sun ; and a little after the sun came the fox . He was old and red . He had white feet , a white tip on his tail , and alert ears . He came out of a hole near the bush and put his head around quickly and lifted his nose up and crouched . Then he walked a few feet as if the ground was hot right under him . He turned around and looked straight up at the hill ; and then he sat on his tail and licked his paw , and I had my rifle up Co my face . My .22 was old and the sight , was off , so I sighted below and to the left of his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world was assured , and just as he licked the side of his jaws , I was easing on the trigger . Yet I did n't fire . Whatever the reason , whatever the restraint , I did n't want to kill that fox and I did n't intend to . I held the sight and kept my cheek on the gun and the finger on the trigger and thought to myself that all I must do is give it a pull and that fox would be dead , and I would be alive . " Go on , " Roy said as if he would kill me himself for being a fool . " I do n't want him , " I said and put down the gun . " Shoot ! " he said right in my ear . " I do n't want him ! " I said aloud and the fox heard and was gone like a shot . Roy stood up and I could see his .22 follow the fox for the first few seconds . Then he fired . I was still lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbling over ; but I did n't care . At the same moment another one came leaping out of the warren and went running away , full of life . " Why did n't you shoot ! " Roy cried as he reloaded his gun . " I do n't know , " I said . I really did n't know . " Are you sick or something ? " I shook my head . I thought for a moment that I would like to stay on this hill forever . Roy looked hard at me and laughed for no reason and forgot about the fox and sat down on the warm side of the hill . " How old are you , boy ? " he asked . " Twelve now , " I told him , still waiting for his temper . " Twelve , " he said slowly . " Do you know how old I was when I lost the Rang Dang , lost my boat , lost everything , and never got it back ? " I did n't know and I did n't care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had no idea what he was talking about except that he had lost something and never got it back . For my part I only knew that I was quietly happy again without knowing why . If I had hoped to solve the puzzle of life by killing a fox for the loss of the cod , I knew I was wrong . Life was life , somehow , and that fox had been too alive for me to shoot . The fish did n't matter , the fox did n't matter , Tom Woodley and the town boys did n't matter ; and though I had spared one life to learn so much , I had killed five or six rabbits by the time we went home . Yes , life was life ; but I had it licked .
