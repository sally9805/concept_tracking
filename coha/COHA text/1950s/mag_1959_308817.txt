The man in the brown suit tugged nervously at his socks , squirmed on his chair , periodically leaped up to loose a volley of abuse at a panting Kentucky player . Out on the floor of Louisville 's Freedom Hall , the University of Kentucky basketball team was botching plays , losing passes , defending raggedly against an alert Illinois team . Coach Adolph Rupp relaxed only when a last-ditch Illinois shot rolled harmlessly off the rim , preserving a 76-75 Kentucky victory . Sighed the Baron : " That one nearly killed me . " <P> In 28 years as head basketball coach at Kentucky , Adolph ( " The Baron " ) Rupp , 57 , has fretted and fidgeted his way through 595 victories , lost only 103 games . His teams have triumphed with a pleasant monotony characteristic of the New York Yankees , won the N.C.A.A. championship a record four times , the National Invitation tournament and 19 Southeastern Conference championships . <P> There have been troubles too . Kentucky 's 1952-53 team was banned from N.C.A.A. play on charges that Rupp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars . But Kentucky did not blame the Baron , in fact gave him a vote of confidence . <P> " I Want to Win . " " He 's not the most modest coach who ever came down the pike , " says West Virginia 's Fred Schaus of Rupp , " but he 's the greatest . " Says Tennessee 's Coach Emmett Lowery : <P> " Life does n't hang on the result of a basketball game , but it seems like it when you play Rupp . " Rupp himself cares little about the effect his self-centered personality has on others . Says he : " I am not engaged in a popularity contest . I want to win basketball games . " So far this season , Kentucky has won them all in tough competition , e.g. , St. Louis , West Virginia , Maryland , at week 's end ran its record to 11-0 by dumping Georgia Tech 72-62 . <P> Rupp 's success at Kentucky is traceable to indefatigable recruiting , and a merciless concentration on perfection of fundamentals . Admits the Baron : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky . Every boy in the state , from the time he 's born , lives for the day he can play at the university . " Once Rupp gets his players , he drills them endlessly and without letup . They live together in the same dormitory , eat a special diet . Practices are conducted in semi-silence , save for an occasional tongue-lashing directed by Rupp at a player who is not giving his all . " Boy , " he will holler sarcastically , " give that ball to someone who knows what to do with it . " To another : " Go back in the stands and read your press clippings . " <P> Playing Together . After a defeat , Rupp has been known to order his players to keep their uniforms on until the crowd has left , then send them back on the floor to iron out the mistakes they had made in the game . There is seldom an outstanding star on Rupp 's fast-breaking , hard-running Kentucky teams . Rupp does not believe in them . " If the star has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . " he explains . Says North Carolina 's Frank McGuire : " Kentucky has found the secret of basketball , that it 's five guys playing together . "
