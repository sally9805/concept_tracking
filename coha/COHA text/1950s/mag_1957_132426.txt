THE BEAUTY EXPERT ? Mrs. Elizabeth Graham , founder and president of Elizabeth Arden , owner of Maine Chance Farm , sends out Jewel 's Reward who , after winning The Champagne , is sure to start The Garden State favorite . Willie Shoemaker rides the winner of four of 10 starts in his quest to nail down the 2-year-old championship . // THE SPORTSWOMAN ? Mrs. Henry Carnegie Phipps , with one ace in Bold Ruler , goes after this big one with a chestnut colt , Misty Flight . Second in both The Futurity and Champagne , the Wheatley Stables entry  --  a brother of Misty Morn  --  is bred for distance and should relish this run of a mile and a sixteenth with Eddie Arcaro. // THE CLOTHING MAKER ? Harry Z. Isaacs , whose Brookfield Farms will be represented by Isendu , has traditionally started the names of his horses with the letter I. He is a successful clothing manufacturer in Baltimore , but his colt , although having won over some of Saturday 's foes , will probably be one of the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A. B. ( Bull ) Hancock , here with $750,000 stallion Tulyar , of which he is part owner , once negotiated the purchase of Nashua for Claiborne Farm . Now he sends another son of Nasrullah out for big money . His colt Nadir can run like the wind when he wants to , but he can also sulk like an unruly child . His best effort could win this one . // THE TOBACCO FARMER ? R. D. Prewitt , a Lexington , Ky. farmer who raises sheep , tobacco , cattle and horses , tried to sell Terra Firma for $10,000 a year ago but , when no takers showed up , he kept the colt to race himself . And so far Terra Firma has won five of 12 races and earned $38,485 . Although he is a game colt with a fine disposition , this son of Ky . Colonel may find the distance too long . // THE BOOT MANUFACTURER ? George Lewis , co-owner with his wife of the California entry of Music Man Fox and Martins Rullah , is a native of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chicago and New York . His colts , named for friends , earned a few friends of their own last week by winning both ends of the tough trial over the track . // THE STEEPLECHASE FAN ? Mrs. Marion duPont Scott , who is one of the most admired supporters of American jump racing , will have her Montpelier colors carried by Nala . The colt , another son of Nasrullah , has been in the money in six of his nine starts . His dam is the great brood mare Accra who has also produced Neji , one of the finer steeplechasers of all time . // THE RACING EXECUTIVE ? William duPont Jr . ' s Rose Trellis , a gelded son of Heliopolis , will carry the familiar blue-and-gold silks of the famous Delaware sportsman  --  founder of Delaware Park  --  and owner of Foxcatcher Farms . Rose Trellis , who will carry well his 122 pounds , was a surprise winner of The Hopeful , but his over-all 1957 form has been inconsistent . // THE HOUSEWIFE ? Mrs. William E. Snell , owner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vine-land , N.J. electrical contractor who was one of the original Garden State stockholders . Owners of a small breeding farm , the Snells have seen My Warrior , a gray Greek Warrior colt , win three starts , including Atlantic City 's Homebred Handicap . // THE TRUCK FARMER ? Mrs. Anna Cannuli , wife of a Burlington , N.J. truck farmer , Anthony Cannuli , got the bay Chance It Tony for $2,300 at last year 's Keeneland Yearling Sales . The colt has so far earned her $17,650 in 16 races . Although fourth in last week 's Garden State trial , Chance It Tony would appear to be outclassed in this high-stepping company .
