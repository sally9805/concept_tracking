txt President Eisenhower has again stepped into the breach to counsel patience and restraint  --  I this time in relation to the retention by Communist China of the 11 captured American fliers . There is understandable American disappointment over the fact that the Secretary-General of the United Nations . Dag Hammarskjold , . has returned from Peking without being able to effect the immediate release of the jailed airmen . Hopes are still strong that the airmen will be released , but the negotiations are at a delicate point . In this juncture , Mr. Eisenhower stepped in to characterize the Hammarskjold mission as " only a first stage " in the negotiations for the release of these fliers and other United Nations personnel detained in China . ' With a careful and powerful choice of language , the President said : " Truth and right are on our side . We must have faith in the community of nations and in the tremendous influence of world opinion . It will not be easy for us to refrain from giving expression to thoughts of reprisal or re taliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must not fall into a Communist trap and , through impetuous words or deeds , endanger the lives of those imprisoned airmen who wear the uniform of our country . " They are fighting men , trained to discipline . We now owe them discipline from ourselves . We must support the United Nations in its efforts , so long as those efforts hold out any promise of success . " The President had several reasons ft* stepping forward with disciplined words of care and moderation . For one thing . a White House pronouncement would help to head off inflammatory pronouncements from either members of Congress or the military speaking out of turn . There are impressive indications that the White House has had private assurances that Red China eventually will release the imprisoned Americans . But this freeing of the 11 men may take some time , perhaps as much as three months . Nothing can be taken for granted . and the present optimism is cautious . But it is obvious that tough talk by Americans . particularly by those of the President 's official family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rocked , if the men are to come home safe . For another thing , the President 's statement would remind the American people that Mr. Hammarskjold 's return did not represent the end of a mission . but that further consideration is now necessary as to next steps . The UN Secretary-General suggests that a condition precedent to the release of the airmen is an improvement of relations between the United States and Communist China . He does net suggest that this ' requires a " deal " in the shape of American recognition of Red China in return for release of the airmen . But he does indicate that some individual , unilateral action or gesture from the United States would help to improve the situation . Whether any such action is feasible in the present state of public and congressional opinion is a question . A final reason why Mr. Eisenhower felt it wise to speak out was the unfortunate impression developed abroad by the " Trip to Omaha " of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UN Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
