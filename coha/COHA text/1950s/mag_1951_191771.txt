Just returned from a two-month tour of duty as head of the TIME-LIFE London Bureau , Thomas Griffith , TIME 'S National Affairs Editor , wrote : <P> The hardest job in reporting Britain is to do justice to what is right about it : the plucky people , the enduring greenness , the reminders , both in man and nature , of a memorable past ; the good nature , the good sense and the good heart of the run of the people ; the values and standards still surviving of a way of life that had much to recommend it even though it also had much in it to reform ; the surprising winter flowers , the endless variety of London street scenes . We all know these things , and treasure them , but find ourselves reporting , instead , the transitory , unpleasant news of rationing , muddle and misgovernment . For one thing , in this winter of 1951 , Londoners talked of little else themselves . <P> So let us talk of what they talk about , and that brings us first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A change of government would be good for the country . " You heard this everywhere , even among Socialists . I heard it on several occasions in Prime Minister Attlee 's own circle of advisers . <P> By all signs , the people axe fed up with the Socialists , and by all signs , the Socialists are fed up with governing . Only tenacity and pride keep them in office . Their revolution is over and so is the thrill of adventure that went with it . In February the Labor government nationalized steel , but it was a halfhearted gesture , made without conviction . In the final debates , steel nationalization was not argued as a good or necessary step but defended as a perseverance in dogma . One Socialist minister , as doctrinaire as they come , conceded over a plate of venison that all the other nationalization proposals ( such as sugar ) were only so much window dressing in the last election . <P> So , their revolution over , the Socialists are condemned to preside over the financing and administering of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dons or trade unionists , as pacifists or Marxists , equips them for this task . It is one of Britain 's misfortunes that the Socialists , representing as they do so large a percentage of the governed , should lack enough experienced leaders who are fit to govern . There are able men among them , but as a party they are ignorant of finance , naive about foreign affairs and antagonistic to the military . <P> I am convinced that it is not ideology which has turned the country against them-the health program , for example , is highly popular-but a reluctant awareness that the Socialists are just not up to the job as men and as administrators . They have only five first-rate men , and of these five , two-Sir Stafford Cripps and Ernest Bevin-are all but out . ( The Attlee-Bevin friendship is the only genuine top-level friendship in the party ; the others eye one another distrustfully ) .
