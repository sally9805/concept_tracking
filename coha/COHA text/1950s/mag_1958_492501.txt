. In her younger years Lillian E. Riggs knew no greater delight than feasting her eyes on the sun-splashed mountains surrounding her Arizona ranch home . Then , about sixteen years ago , Mrs. Riggs became totally blind . " It was just as if the bottom had dropped out of my world , " she says . For a while Lillian had the comforting companionship of her husband and her mother . But suddenly this , too , was taken from her . Her husband , Ed , suffered a fatal stroke in 1950 , and her mother died later the same year . Lillian Riggs was left alone with the ranch and her memories . At this dismal juncture Mrs. Riggs could have turned over the management of her lands and her cattle to others and settled down to a life of unseeing idleness in one of the comfortable rocking chairs that adorn her home . But that was not in her . A strong-willed woman who despises inactivity , she chose to go on living her accustomed full and active existence . Today , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has pretty well adjusted herself to her blindness , she has had other troubles to struggle with  --  not the least of them , drought . For the past several years she has been plagued , like many other cattle folk in the Southwest , with the problem of too little rain . The feed on her ranges shrank , and her water sources dried up one by one . Early last summer , when the tanks in the upper pasture went dry , Lillian had to buy water at twenty-four dollars a load to keep her cattle alive . She went to bed each night with a prayer for rain , and her first question each morning was : " How does the sky look today ? " The dry weather broke early in July to the accompaniment Of spectacular electrical storms . Showers came thick and fast . Tanks filled . Dry wells began giving water . Pasturelands changed color from gold to green . " Like old times , " exulted Lillian during a thunderstorm , stretching out her hand to get the feel of the life-giving downpour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months since have not lived up to that early promise . Up to this writing , the winter rains have been short of normal and Lillian is beginning to wonder whether the long cycle of drought is really finished , after all . Faraway Ranch is well named ; the handiest grocery store , for instance , is thirty-seven miles distant . The ranch stands at the threshold of a wild and fantastically eroded area known as the Wonderland of Rocks . Less than a century ago , this rugged region was the homeland of the Chiricahua Apaches and their great leader , Cochise . The strange rocky world up-canyon is now preserved for posterity as the Chiricahua National Monument . It attracts ? thousands of visitors annually , but remains appealingly unspoiled . Like the rocks and the cypress trees around her , Lillian Riggs has been at Faraway Ranch as long as must ( Continued on Page 1:12 ) PbolOvapiti by Joao , Geed , ' . of her neighbors can remember . Since she took aver management , many helpers have come and gone , but there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blindness . Lillian supervises everything and misses nothing . She is constantly moving about and asking questions . " 1 must know everything that is going on , " she told me . " If I did n't I would have to quit . " When this writer first went to Faraway the ranch was an all-woman operation . Lillian 's two comely employees , Adeline ( Dell Lemos and Donna Cramer , seemed capable of doing just about anything around the old place that a pair of male ranch hands could do . Watching Del throw , tie and deworm a calf was a queasy experience for the onlooker , but for Del it was just part of the day 's work . Unhappily , Faraway just was n't big enough for three such individualists as Lillian , Del and Donna . The two girls ultimately moved to another ranch , and a couple from Minnesota took their places . Lillian 's brother , Ben , comes down from the Verde Valley now and then to help out at the old homestead . Ben is a muscular old-timer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the Sierra Madres to the Superstitions . He is quite a hand at spinning yarns about life in the old Southwest . Some of his favorite tales arc about Billy Bowlegs , the hard-rock miner over in Paradise , who gained lasting fame in these parts by consuming fifty eggs at one sitting . Billy Bowlegs accomplished this feat on a bet . And to top it off he devoured a large order of ham and eggs , This story was retold recently in the salty columns of a newsletter published in Chiricahua occasionally by Carson Morrow , who is something of an authority on the region . As a boy , Morrow attended classes at the Paradise schoolhouse , and his schoolmarm at that time was Lillian Erickson , later to become Lillian Riggs . Morrow 's paper boasts that it is published in the Chincahua mountains , " where there are more good people , more beautiful scenery and more burn roads than in any other area of its size in the United States . " On my arrival at Faraway 1 looked forward to a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuous activity . It was not to bc . " Del and I are riding the pasture tomorrow , " said the energetic Mrs. Riggs . " Wo n't you come along ? " So morning found me trailing through the grassland behind Del and Lillian on a horse chosen for its tractability . Del. in the lead , looked very businesslike in her wide hat , chaps and spurs . Mrs. Riggs , also in chaps , checked shirt and sombrero , rode easily alongside , holding her reins in one hand and a guide rope attached to Dcl 's saddle in the other . We were skirting the edge of Sulphur Spring Valley . one of Arizona 's pre-eminent cattle areas . The yellow grass was all around us . It stretched like wall-to-wall carpeting across the valley from the Chiricahuas to the Dragoons . In the clear air the jagged pinnacles of the Dragoons seemed no more than a rifle-shot distant , but we knew they were forty miles away . Lillian Riggs had spent most of her life in and around this valley . She was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renowned Apache Pass , and was brought to the family homestead as an infant in arms . Long before she went blind the landmarks of mountain and plain were etched indelibly on her memory . Now , riding with her , I found it hard to believe she could not see , so at home was she in these surroundings . We drew up at a grove of live oaks , where a group of range cattle had stopped grazing to regard us vacuously . Del turned to the slender lady beside her . " Seven cows here , " she reported , " three with calves , three more calving soon . One heifer has a bad eye . Needs attention . " Lillian took this in . " What 's that calf bawling about ? " she asked , looking with unseeing eyes in the direction of a commotion up the hill . Del explained that a calf had strayed from its mother and was doing what a lost child usually does under like circumstances . Mrs. Riggs turned toward me . " When a cow or a calf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be pretty sure something is wrong . It may be a trilling thing ; it may be something that needs attention . Anyway , it 's always a good idea to find out what the trouble is . " We drove on toward the end of the pasture , while Del tallied the cattle , checked their condition and measured the water level in the tank at the windmill . All this she reported to Mrs. Riggs . The dry grass swished underfoot , but beneath it there was a showing of green . The light showers of a few weeks before were producing dividends , Primroses and California poppies spotted the landscape with white and orange , but their stalks were stubby and poor . Anybody could see that what this land needed was more rain  --  not just a few perfunctory downpours , but a whole series of wet years that would soak the pasture many feet through and build up the subsurface water table . Lillian Riggs seemed to sense my thoughts . " When the first settlers came to this valley , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rider 's stirrups , Now look at it . The old springs arc going dry  --  and some of the wells loo . Oh , we have a wet year now and then , but as long as I can remember it has been getting drier . " The horses plodded along a while before Lillian spoke again : " But it takes a lot of trouble to beat us down . Not many ranchers have quit . Once you have lived here , you do n't want to live anywhere else . We 've got a wonderful climate , plenty of elbowroom and beautiful surroundings . That 's something . We may sell our cattle ; we do n't often sell our land , " Like most ranchers of the area , Lillian runs Herefords exclusively . She buys good bulls , but is not interested in show stock . Pampered livestock , she says , is not well suited to a country where some years it takes from twenty-five acres up , to feed just one cow and her progeny . " When I 'm buying a cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know first whether it 's a good rustler. - I asked Mrs. Riggs how many head of cattle she owned . She smiled , but I could see it was the wrong question . " I have never found a polite way to evade that question , " she replied , " The number of cattle I own is nobody 's business . Do people ask their friends how much money they have in the bank or the amount they own in bonds or stock ? I 'll say this much . Conditions have been so dry that my range carries only about half the number of mother cows it could support in years of normal rainfall . " In good years , the 7000 acres on which Lillian Riggs runs her herd would support 300 to 350 head of cattle . Now there are probably fewer than 200 , counting calves , a few bulls and yearlings . We started back to the ranch house , skirting clumps of prickly pear , yucca and mescal  --  unfriendly plants , all . At the mouth of Bonita Canyon we paused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neil Erickson and his wife , Emma , came to this canyon as settlers in 1888 . They lived the hard , exciting lives of pioneers . Now they lie in peace on the land they homesteaded . We headed our mounts toward the main ranch buildings , about a mile up the canyon . Towering cypress trees and 4 spreading sycamores marked the course of the dry creek bed . Beyond the ranch , battalions of sculptured rocks looked down on the canyon  --  the outer guardians of the Wonderland of Rocks . AI the old corral we dismounted and Lillian doffed her chaps and spurs . She took my arm for guidance up the stony road to the big yellow ranch house . The house had a history . When Lillian 's father and his bride first settled in this canyon the danger of Apache raids was uppermost in their minds , Gcronimo and his band had just come to terms , but a few renegades still roamed the region . The first building to go up was a windowless structure of stones  --  more a fortress than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large house of adobe  --  the present one . It is square , two-storied and homely , but it makes up in character what it lacks in beauty . Several gnarled old almond trees stand in the yard  --  testimonials to Erickson 's thrift . It seems that one winter the family received some almonds for Christmas . Instead of eating them , they planted them . This background of frugality has made an impression on Lillian . She is herself a careful person . " All my life , " she said , " I have disciplined myself not to buy things l can do without . " Lillian Riggs knows every nook and cranny of the old house , and she feels her way with sureness through the cool rooms . The furnishings are uld-fashioned but snug . Pictures crowd the walls , along with a bobcat pelt and the mounted heads of two fine bucks shot in the vicinity of the ranch . Among the photographs arc many of the grotesquely shaped rocks up-canyon . Lillian can indicate any picture and discuss it in detail , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working ranch and guest ranch ; and the tourist season is any old time . Besides the main ranch house , there is the white frame house , the stone cottage and the old log cabin dating back to the 1880 's  --  enough room , in a pinch , for a couple of dozen guests . But the guest-ranch business , like the rainfall , is spotty and unpredictable . There are days on end w hen nobody calls at Faraway but the mailman , only to be followed by a rush of tourists demanding meals , or saddle horses , or overnight accommodations . Though the accommodations are old-fashioned , only a congenital stuffed shirt could fail to melt under the relaxing informality of the place . Lillian 's friends and relatives arc constantly urging her to sell out and retire , which she could doubtless well afford if she were so minded . " Everybody thinks I 'm crazy to carry on , " the sighttew woman says . " But if I quit , how am I going to keep busy ? I 'd like to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old home where I 've met people from all over lb* world and where I hope to meet many more in years to come . Nor do I want to give up my riding . When I 'm in a saddle 1 feel I 'm living again . I 'm in no hurry to part company with my cattle either Cows arc so easy to keep happy . " Dinner is always an important occasion at the ranch house , and Sunday dinner especially . When the cook clangs the iron triangle , the guests gather in the liv- . ing room , where they find Lillian occupy-11P ing her favorite scat opposite the big brick fireplace . A glowing fire of blackjack oak exudes a welcome warmth . Newly arrived ( Continued on Parr 134 ) 111 ( Continued front Nee in ) guests arc often taken aback to discover that their graying , straight-backed hostess is blind , but Mrs. Riggs quickly puts them at ease %s ills her lively interest in all subjects and her seemingly bottomless fund of lore on the Chiricahua region . When all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining room , where she takes a seat at the head of the table while the others assort Ihemselses along its sides . It is a variegated procession of tourists that passes through . During my stay at Faraway we had such diverse visitors as a builder of swimming pools from Tucson , a trio of tourists from Holland ( " Could you show us some live lizards ? " 1 , bird watchers , butterfly collectors and others . The Chiricahua Mountains have a special appeal for nature lovers because of the amazing variety of bird , animal and insect life to be found in the area . Other guests come to eaplore the Wonderland of Rocks , to visit the many other nearby scenic and historic attractions  --  or simply to relax and enjoy a climate that is one of the region 's main drawing cards , Mrs. Riggs enjoys the contacts with her guests . it is one of her ways of keeping in touch with the unseen outer world , But she has no patience with the occasional irresponsible types who will deliberately mar or destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A prize example of such vandalism occurred recently in the Monument . A trio of young servicemen . on mischief bent , placed a hydraulic jack under one of the better-known balanced rocks in the area and attempted to topple It . They were caught in the act before any damage was done . Mrs. Riggs was outraged . " Can you beat that for stupidity ? " was all she could say , Her reaction was understandable . These beloved rocks have been her neighbors all her life , and she feels a proietary interest in them . T Wonderland of Rocks is the product of a succession of lava flows followed by uncounted centuries of splitting . chiseling and polishing by the forces of nature , Much of the lava rock is of a hard and unusual type known as welded rhyolite tuff . It lacks the vivid coloration found in the cliffs of Northern Arizona and Southern Utah , but nature has touched up the rather drab surface with a gaudy patina of multicolored lichens . The Monument is a bizarre kind of place  --  a place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city suddenly frozen into rock . There is something here for evcrybody'simagination  --  likenessesof birds and beasts , people and freaks , anything and everything from the outlandish to the sublime . Balanced rocks arc plentiful , some shaped like human heads , others like mushrooms , and at least one like the cloud thrown up by an atom bomb . There are leaning towers , castle battlements , a giant 's throne and a natural bridge . There are some remarkable pinnacles , too , one of them , the Totem Pole , with a shaft almost 150 feet high . Lillian 's father , Neil Erickson , was one of the first white men to penetrate this area . With two neighbors he pushed deep into the rocky stronghold while pursuing an Indian , Big Foot Massai , who had stolen a horse from a nearby ranch . The three men failed to catch up with Big Foot ( who later set the horse free ) , but they saw something of the stony labyrinth into which he had disappeared . It was years later before people began taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was among the first . tic discovered the major curiosity of the region  --  a balanced rock weighing 650 tons , poised like a spinning top on a spot only thirty-nine inches in diameter . Lil T11 lian shared Ed 's interest and helped him cut the first trail into the wonderland . The two gave names to some of the strange formations and through their photographs stirred the interest of the outside world . This led to further exploration by others and , in 1924 , to the setting aside of the region as the Chiricahua National Monument . A mountain peak , named for Ed Riggs , perpetuates his memory . Lillian Riggs was brought up in a pioneering tradition . Her grandfather came from Sweden as an immigrant , only to be killed by Indians in the Dakotas . Her father came later with a determination to asenge the slaying of his parent . He enlisted in the United States Army and sought service in the Southwest , where the Apaches were still fighting the whites . As a cavalryman he took part in campaigns against Chief Loco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he saw that it was the Indian . not the white man , who needed sympathy . His desire for vengeance faded and before his death was replaced by a real affection for the Apaches , " Dad always said the Indians were cruelly mistreated by the white man , " Mrs. Riggs told me . " He said the Apaches were only fighting for their homeland . He once remarked that in all his life he was never double-crossed or lied to by an In-dian , " Neil Erickson was a sergeant when he retired to marry Emma Peterson and homestead the rock-rimmed clearing in Bonita Canyon . Lillian was the first of their three children , and it was n't until she was sixteen that she left the ranch to go to high school in Illinois . Her parents had to skimp to keep her there , so Lillian telescoped a four-year course into two years and returned to Arizona Territory to teach . Her first job , at eighteen , was at nearby Turkey Creek , reputedly the toughest school in tough Cochise County . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Riggs recalls . " Some of the students were older than I. Most of them turned out all right , but one later became an outlaw and killed two people . He seemed such a nice boy too , " . Lillian spent much of the next nine years alternately teaching and studying before returning to the ranch to stay . In 1923 , she married Ed Riggs . At one time the couple laid plans for converting Faraway into an outstanding guest ranch , but these dreams went aglimmering when Lillian 's eyesight began to fail . Mrs. Riggs believes that the trouble with her eyes traces back to a full from a bucking horse thirty-five years ago . In any case , it was not long afterward that she became aware of a blurring of the vision in one eye . Years later , doctors pronounced her 12 SATURDAY RYENIND POET trouble a cataract . She underwent an operation , but lost the sight of the cyc . Then the other eye began to cloud ow . Meanwhile , an X-ray examination disclosed for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall from the horse years before . Doctors coneectesg that a pinched nerve might have contributed to the loss of sight . It was by then too late to do anything about it . Mrs. Riggs became completely blind in the spring of 1942 . " Life seemed hardly worth living , " Mrs. Riggs said . " Readjustment was terribly hard . 1 tried learning Braille , but my fingers were not sensitive enough . I had done too much rough work in my time . I decided I must learn typing : and after a while I managed it . I used to be a fast walker . Now I had to learn to walk slowly , and I hated it . I was thankful to be able to continue my riding . " Horseback riding has been a lifetime passion with Lillian Riggs . Long before she lost her sight she was known as an expert horsewoman . She is still very much ) at home in the saddle . When riding , Mrs. Riggs is always accompanied- She usually keeps a grip on the guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then she drops the rope to enjoy the thrill of a gallop . Once a week she rides the range , sometimes for four or use hours at a stretch . On these trips Mrs. Riggs rides a big gray named Britches , which she calls her " seeing-eye " horse . " Britches knows I can not see . " Lillian said . " He knows it , and he takes advantage of it . But he is a good horse . He stops when the going is dangerous . He never gets excited . He carries me as if I were china . " If Lillian is not out riding , where she prefers to be , you are quite likely to find her making beds , sweeping floors , ironing clothes or lugging a bucket of water from the old well outside the kitchen door , the evening someone sits with Mrs. Riggs on the big divan and reads her the contents of the Douglas Dispatch . If the cattlemen 's newsletter is in. she goes through that too . And when time hangs heavy she pecks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking books or the k.reaclpiion.0 up with Mrs. Riggs takes a lot of doing . She never misses a roundup or a branding if her cattle are involved , If there is trouble on the range , she insists on investigating it personally . At shipping time . she stands by while her cattle are weighed and loaded , listening in on all details of the operation . If a cow or a calf turns sick , Lillian is soon there with a helper to check the animal and prescribe treatment . Despite her blindness , Mrs. Riggs refuses to become a social recluse . She took me as her guest to the monthly meeting of the Gay Day Social Club , at the comfortable ranch home of one of its members . Ladies came from all over the valley bearing home-cooked viands fur the groaning luncheon board . Lillian belongs p also to the Cowbelles , an organization of cattlewomen and wives of eattlemen . Many of the Cowbelles carry on their car windows the cattlemen 's slogan : " Eat Beef  --  Keep Slim . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take off a few pounds to make the slogan convincing . Every second Friday , with unfailing regularity , Lillian Riggs boards her canary-yellow hardtop and , with a companion at the wheel , rides down the valley to Douglas , sixty-eight miles distant . There she visits her hairdresser , does her shopping and perhaps crosses the line into Agua Pricta , Mexico . l went with her one Friday and was hardly conscious of driving with a blind person . Taking her cue from cattle barriers and turns  --  which she could " feel " ? Mrs. Riggs seemed to know just about where we were at all times . " Now that ranch on your left , " she would say , shortly after we had rattled across a telltale cattle guard , " belongs to Billie Riggs . It 's one of the biggest in the valley . " Ranch after ranch in Sulphur Spring Valley belongs to a Riggs or a relative of a Riggs . The Riggses were among the first to run cattle on the valley 's grassy ranges . It all started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children arrived in the valley with a few head of Texas steers and dairy cattle in 1879 . In the beginning the Riggses homesteaded raw pasture land . Then they bought land . Then they bought more land . Their holdings grew and grew . Their cattle empire on the east side of the valley came to be known as the Riggs Settlement , Today the holdings of the Riggs clan , in and out V of the valley , are believed to add up to around 400 square miles . The old couple have long since passed on , but their living descendants number more than 120 . Most Riggses , when they die , are buried in the Riggs family cemetery , an iron-kneed plot far out on the rippling grasslands . When a much-loved member of the family , Mrs. Nettie Riggs . passed on recently at the age of SI , a procession of cars two miles long followed the hearse thirty miles from Willcox to the little graveyard on the prairie . it was nearly time now for the spring roundup at Lillian 's upper pasture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldrige , neighboring ranchers , had volunteered to lend a hand . Ben would be available , also Adeline Lemos and Donna Cramer . But fixing a date was something of a problem . Like many other a ranchers of the area , Mrs. Riggs never embarks on an operation as important as this without consulting the almanac . The almanac showed a series of unpropitious days . The signs were right , however , for Tuesday of the following week . So Tuesday it would be . A few days before the branding , I made a trip to the Double-Z with Mrs. Riggs . The ranch lies in Apache Pass , scene of more ambushes and killings during the Indian wars than any similar length of trail in the Southwest . To reach it we followed the dirt road north along the foothills of the Chiricahuas , passing the rocky mass of Bowie Peak and the knobbed mountain known as Helen 's Dome or Helen 's Doom , depending on which old-timer you prefer to believe . We clattered across a cattle guard and the ksightless lady beside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . You see that fence that runs from the cattle guard up to the base of Helen 's Dome ? That 's the southern boundary of the Double-Z , " We climbed for several miles through the gently sloping grasslands into the low , stony pass that connects Sulphur Springs Valley with the San Simon Valley . Near the crest of Apache Pass we halted , and I told Mrs. Riggs where we were . " I thought so , " she said . " Now look up to the left and you 'll see a cluster of oak trees , near the end of my pasture . That 's vi here Federal troops hanged six Indians in reprisal for the murder of three white men by the Chiricahua Apaches . " For a defile that had seen so much bloodshed , Apache Pass seemed extraordinarily tranquil . Overhead , a couple of high-flying jets were scratching up the sky with their vapor trails , but except for that all was peace . The scattered boulders from which many an ambush had been staged basked innocently in the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Butterfield stage depot and trading post had melted back into the earth ; and the mesquite . the ocatillo , the prickly pear and the bear grass had taken over . Here and there clumps of Indian paintbrush made blood-colored splashes on the stony terrain . East of the summit the pass was rougher and longer . In the canyon bed we made out the blurred tracks of the old stage route and looking south we could see the ruins of Fort Bowie . There is not much left there now except chunks of adobe wall and fragments of weathered wood spiked with antique nails . But a movement is afoot among history-minded Arizonians to have the ruins preserved as a national monument . Came roundup day , and Lillian Riggs and her crew took off in pickups before dawn for the Double-Z . There they switched to saddle horses , spread out and began driving the cattle up the long sweep of grassy range toward the corrals . Lillian rode right on the heels of the herd , sometimes unguided , sometimes holding the guide rope on Del 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needing attention were cut out of the herd and treated . Then it was the calves ' turn . Separating them from their mothers was quite a chore , but it was finally accomplished , to the accompaniment of loud bawling from both generations . One by one the little fellows were pushed through a chute onto a kind of rack , or table , where they got the full treatment . While Ben applied the branding iron to a protesting animal 's rump , Del got a firm grip on its head and with a razor-edged knife sliced off the tips of its ears . If the calf needed dehorning , Del did it , smearing a tarlikc antiseptic over the bleeding wound . She was soon blood-spattered from shirt to chaps . Donna stood in the background flourishing a hypodermic needle which she injected with vigor into the hide of each calf as it came onto the table . The inoculation would immunize the animals against blackleg , hemorrhag , hic septicemia and malignant edema . Meanwhile another member of the crew , Murray Riggs , stood ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gory , though mercifully quick operation , and it was hardly surprising that the calves left the branding table a little unsteady on their pins , A pat on their bottoms sent them tottering toward their mothers standing in an anxious semicircle about fifty feet from the operating table , each waiting for her particular little darling to emerge from its ordeal . As each calf came out there was a commotion and general edging forward among the waiting cows . One after the other they inspected and sniffed the bewildered calf until Junior and his mother were rejoined . Throughout this performance Lillian Riggs sat on a cottonwood log within a few feet of the branding table . She could not sec the branding , but she could hear the bawling of the calves and she could smell the smoke of their burning hair and their scorched flesh as the branding iron was applied . She looked tired and drawn after the long , hard day . " I hate brdadings , " she sa id . " I hate the hurting and the mutilation of the calves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with at one time . At least they wo n't have to go through it again . " The shadows were long when we drove back to Faraway Ranch . And after a few 135 more days it was time for me to take my leave . Reluctantly I put Bonita Canyon behind me and started out across the spacious valley . Looking back at the Chiricahuas I could make out clearly the great stone face that is known as Cochise Head . This is the profile of a steeping Indian , recumbent and relaxed . I found myself wishing I could go back to those quiet , friendly mountains . I think I was beginning to understand the peace that Mrs. Riggs finds in those precious rocks of hers .
