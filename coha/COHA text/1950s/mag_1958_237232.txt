Out from Du Pont last week came a new liquid gas dubbed Freon C-318 . While the name was just so much gobbledygook to consumers , the gas itself may play a big part in their lives . If tests prove successful , C-318 will bring a vast expansion of the aerosol industry by making possible a big new pantry of liquid-gas-dispensed foods such as frostings , sandwich spreads , sauces and syrups . Until now , aerosol foods have been slowed by the fact that the liquid gases used in nonfood products have been ruled out by the Food and Drug Administration . ( Compressed gases are now in use in a few food products but often lose their pressure before the food is exhausted , though recently developed compressed nitrogen shows promise of whipping the problem . ) <P> Aerosol men figure that the pushbutton foods will help double sales of aerosol products by 1961 . Sales have gone up more than tenfold since 1951 , topped $400 million last year , are heading for $500 million in 1958 . Every day almost 10 million U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million women put on aerosol hair sprays . The 250 different aerosol products on the market can stop runs in hosiery , smoke bees out of hives , extinguish fires , bandage wounds and deodorize homes , pets or people . Said a Manhattan merchandising expert : " People will buy anything in those fascinating pushbutton cans-even air . " Aerosol men agreed . Recently Liquid Glaze , Inc. brought out an aerosol can of compressed gas called Spair , which can inflate a flat tire to 22 Ibs. pressure in six seconds . <P> Battle Against Bugs . Aerosol owes its existence to the anopheles mosquito . During World War II two young Department of Agriculture scientists , Lyle D. Goodhue and William N. Sullivan Jr. , developed the " bug bomb " to kill mosquitoes . The Government got the patent on aerosol ( it still licenses , free , all marketers of aerosol insecticides ) ; Scientists Goodhue and Sullivan got nothing . <P> At first , few companies saw a commercial market for the aerosol cans because their welded steel walls , necessary to hold their high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . But as Du Pont developed lower-pressure gases , the cans became much lighter , and the aerosol industry started to boom . <P> Chance for Small Business . The industry is still so new-and there are so many aerosol products yet to be developed-that many small businessmen are pouring into the field . For example , an Australian shepherd wrote to Du Pont about the problem of marking sheep to determine which ones had been vaccinated . So Du Pont developed an aerosol marker . Several hundred shepherds wrote the company to praise the new product , and now one of them plans to market the sheep dye . <P> In the future , a great growth will come in aerosol drugs . Pharmaceutical companies have begun to market heart medicine in aerosol cans . In case of an angina attack , the patient puts the aerosol tube in his mouth , gets the proper dosage with a single press of a button . Also starting to come out : cortisone skin medicines , burn ointments and antiseptics in aerosol cans .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
