THE SWEENIAD ( 66 pp. ) - Myra Buttle - Sagamore ( $2 ) . <P> <P> A man who sees himself become a public monument in his own lifetime runs the risk of finding rude and irreverent remarks scribbled on the plinth . Such is the case of Britain 's T. S. Eliot . Now he has had the ultimate accolade : a full-and fancy-dress parody . In the season 's least subtle anagram , it is signed Myra Buttle ; it represents the rebuttal to Eliot of a waspish and clever Cambridge lecturer in Far Eastern history named Victor Purcell ( possibly , the publishers heavily hint , he had some distinguished anti-Eliot collaborators , including Robert Graves and C. Day Lewis ) . In Britain The Sweeniad-titled for Apeneck Sweeney , Eliot 's loathed modern subman-has already provoked tempests in all the best literary teapots . " Bravo ! " cried Graham Greene . " A delight , " said Bertrand Russell ( who was once more or less described by Poet Eliot as an " irresponsible foetus " ) . <P> For any reader even vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fun-it might be titled Sweeney Among the Mockingbirds . Parodist Purcell has great sport with Eliot 's comparison shopping between languages and religions , his footnote-prone scholarship , his frequent obscurity ( " Fiffles the refulgence of the Pliocene " ) . Typical of the parody is one passage from a psuedo-Wasteland : <P> . . . And when we were out on bail , <P> staying with the Dalai Lama , My uncle , he gave me a ride on a yak , And I was speechless . He said , Mamie Mamie , grasp his ears . And off we went Beyond Yonkers , then I felt safe . <P> I drink most of the year and then I have a Vichy , * <P> This sort of spoofing aside , the book has a deadly serious animus : its real intention against Eliot is not to tear him for his bad verses but to attack him for his principles-which Eliot once oversimplified in his self-description as " an Anglo-Catholic in religion , a classicist in literature , and a royalist in politics . " Lapsing into angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being a reactionary , a Christian , an American , a spoilsport and ployer of anti-lifemanship , a sociologically irresponsible escapist . In a typical passage , Purcell complains that " The very great improvement in the living conditions of the working classes " after World War I was " of no concern " to Eliot-which is about as irrelevant as panning Shakespeare for being a jingo . <P> In The Dunciad , Alexander Pope 's genius and malice made Colley Cibber memorable ; in The Vision of Judgment , Byron made Southey immortal . But if the name of Victor Purcell-or Myra Buttle-is remembered in a hundred years it will be for the fact that he threw a dead cat at a living poet . Before The Sweeniad nears its inevitable conclusion ( " This is the way that Sweeney ends . Not with a curse but a mutter " ) , the satire has fallen heavily among the bric-a-brac . <P> <P> *The original : . . . And when we were children , staying at the archduke 's , My cousin 's , he took me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Marie , Marie , hold on tight . And down we went . In the mountains , there you feel free . I read , much of the night , and go south in the winter .
