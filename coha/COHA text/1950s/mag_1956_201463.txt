The Eddy Duchin Story ( Columbia ) continues the succession of reverent film biographies of U.S. musicmakers without varying the dependable formula of Boy seeks Fame , Boy gets Fame , Boy realizes Fame is n't everything . <P> As told in the movie , Pianist Eddy Duchin 's way in the world was singularly easy . He arrived breathless in Manhattan , and , within minutes , had a job in Leo Reisman 's band at the old Central Park Casino , and was launched on a successful career that continued without impediment . With equal speed , he met , wooed and wed socially prominent Marjorie Oelrichs , and was instantly accepted by her friends and relatives . <P> <P> In fact , the only tragedy in Duchin 's life was death , a subject that Hollywood ordinarily does not like to contemplate with seriousness . Duchin 's bride died in childbirth , and Eddy had scarcely recovered from the shock when he learned that he was afflicted with leukemia . The film suggests that he had no consolations , either of religion or philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured complaints about how unfair " They " are in arranging man 's fate , the problem was resolved entirely in terms of how and when Eddy should tell his son and prospective second wife about his condition . <P> <P> Tyrone Power plays Eddy with unflagging boyishness , and Kim Novak acts the doomed Marjorie Oelrichs with spectral intimations ( " Hold me , Eddy ; I 'm afraid of the wind . . . " ) . This blowy motif runs throughout the film : death 's advent is always heralded by wind-driven snow , rain or autumn leaves . A stately newcomer , Australia 's Victoria Shaw , is introduced as Duchin 's second wife , and a pair of clipped-accented moppets ( Mickey Maga and Rex Thompson ) perform as the Duchin child at different ages . Moviegoers may enjoy the rippling piano notes ( actually played by Carmen Cavallaro ) that made Duchin a society favorite during the ' 30s , and there is one pleasant scene in which Power plays a duet with a small Chinese boy during his wartime tour of duty as operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feeling ( Paramount ) is a movie adaptation of the 1954 Broadway hit , King of Hearts , by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke , a comedy that screened its thin plot behind an electrical display of wisecracks . Hollywood has added twice as many writers ( Norman Panama , Melvin Frank , I.A.L. Diamond , William Altman ) and got a corresponding increase in plot and even a few more jokes . <P> As a Bob Hope vehicle , the film has its points . Bob is pictured as a ne'er-do-well cartoonist and psychopathic coward who has turned to an analyst for help because Bromo Seltzer has failed him . Reduced to painting nudes on ties and landscapes on the backs of turtles , Hope is visited in his garret by a dazzling blonde ( Eva Marie Saint ) who used to be his wife and is now engaged to George Sanders , a moneyed comic-strip artist whose ego contains more hot air than a Turkish bath .
