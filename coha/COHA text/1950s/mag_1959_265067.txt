Pope John XXIII stepped into his black Cadillac one day last week and rode to the church of St. Paul Outside the Walls . ( Along his route , the night before , policemen had painted out life-size posters of Paris-born Cinema Star Marina Vlady in a skintight bathing suit . ) In a hall adjoining St. Paul 's , before 20 surprised cardinals assembled to celebrate the 1,900th anniversary of the Epistle to the Romans , the Pope announced what may well be the most important 20th century landmark in the history of the Roman Catholic Church ; the 21st Ecumenical Council , which will probably meet in 1961 . <P> Convened under the presidency of the Pope or his legate , an ecumenical council brings together the whole world 's Roman Catholic hierarchy-cardinals , patriarchs , primates , archbishops and bishops , and the abbots and superiors of certain orders . The decisions of the ecumenical council , subject only to papal confirmation , are binding on all Catholics ; it was the last ecumenical council in 1869-70 that declared the dogma of papal infallibility. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council will be " to invite the separated religious communities . . . to seek the unity of the church , desired by so many souls all over the world . " Said John XXIII : " We ardently desire their return to the house of the common Father . . . they will not enter a strange house but their own . " Prime target among the " separated religious communities " is Eastern Orthodoxy . In Pope John 's first public speech the day after his election , he went out of his way to beam benevolence toward the estimated 150 million communicants who are spiritual descendants of the church in Constantinople , which in the 4th century easily rivaled the authority of Rome and finally broke with the Roman Pope over a combination of political and doctrinal disagreements . <P> Unlike Roman Catholicism , Eastern Orthodoxy has no single head but what has been described as " an oligarchy of patriarchs . " There are five major patriarchates : Constantinople ( Istanbul ) , Alexandria , Antioch , Jerusalem and Moscow , plus lesser patriarchs for the Serbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patriarchate of Constantinople , called " first among equals , " whose present incumbent is Archbishop Athenagoras I , longtime friend of Pope John . <P> During his 20 years as a Vatican diplomat in Bulgaria and in Greece and Turkey , John is said to have grown optimistic about the possibilities of closer relations with the Eastern church . <P> Last week one leading Vatican spokesman said that " the chances of healing the rift between the Roman and Orthodox churches are better now than they have been for hundreds of years . " A major factor in the new climate has been Vatican support of the Orthodox churches against increasing pressure from Moscow . But one immovable foundation of Roman doctrine seems to stand in the path of reunion : the insistence that the Bishop of Rome is successor of St. Peter , Vicar of Christ and supreme ruler of all Christians .
