THE day our boy left for boarding school was an emotional , if not to say trying , day for all of us . I had taken the day off , to drive him to the school , and I slept late , wishing to avoid the early morning confusion , since " Goggle " ( a private nickname I will employ to avoid embarrassing revelations ) had asked his close friend , Alan , to spend the night . Breakfast on these mornings usually had an element of whimsy about it . I knew how it had gone when I was awakened by the sound of voices under the window . My wife was in the car to take Alan home , and she was having trouble getting out of the driveway .. , " Ma , " I heard Goggle say , in the intolerable , flat voice of adolescence , which falls on the ear like an air-hammer attacking an asphalt paving , " why do n't you put her in reverse ? " " Because I do not wish to , " my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that she had been pushed too far , and wearily I sat up on the edge of the bed , thinking , it 's the last day . Then it hit me again , as it had been hitting me for the past several weeks , only harder . Goggle was going away to boarding school . I was downstairs drinking coffee when they got back , and while Goggle was outside under the car , trying to see if that new knock meant that the block was about to fall right out on the pavement , my wife told me how her day had begun . Alan had been balancing a large wooden salad spoon on his finger while waiting to be served ( if it occurs to you to askwhy he would be holding a large wooden salad spoon at the breakfast table , do n't imagine for a moment that I can enlighten you ) and when his plate was put before him the spoon fell . There were still egg splashes on the wall , and the pieces of broken plate were gathered together on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake plate that Goggle had broken the night before while using it to demonstrate a football play . " At least I got Alan home , " my wife said . " Now if I can get Goggle to concentrate on packing his things I think I will survive the day . " I went out and coaxed him from under the car ( the front axle looked very doubtful , the exhaust pipe was worn through in two places , and there was some mysterious thing " hanging down " which probably meant that we needed a new universal joint ) and he ascended to his slave labor with deep , pitiful groans . " What do I need all this junk for ? " he called from his room . I had asked myself that same question many times in the weeks before . When the list had come from the school my wife attacked it dutifully , and now in Goggle 's room beside the open foot locker , the Navy duffel bag , and the suitcase were the neat stacks of sheets , towels , blankets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still numb from sewing on name-tapes ) , and I found these objects understandable enough , but the " dark " suit for dress , the jackets for classroom wear , the broadcloth shirts with button-down collars , and especially the " dress " hat were completely incomprehensible to me . Who was going to make Goggle wear them ? His normal dress was a pair of blue jeans . When he went to bed at night my wife was usually too exhausted to pick them up from the floor and put them in the clothes hamper , and Goggle got up so early that she never got to them first , so usually the same blue jeans were worn until they began to come apart at awkward points of stress , and then he was persuaded to ease into another pair . With these he wore , I think , socks , although I ca n't be too sure , and shoes that had once been recognizable as such , but soon came to resemble those foot coverings seen in news pictures as worn by Korean Communist prisoners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a jersey of some kind , and either a red ski cap , or a large straw hat from Mexico . I was so accustomed to seeing him dressed in this way that I rather resented the clothes upstairs myself . p GG LEASE go up and get him started , " my wife said . " You do it so much better than I do . It 's sort of man 's work any-way . " I accepted this transparent device with the silence it deserved , and started upstairs with deep , pitiful groans of my own . " And please do something about his ties , " she added . She was standing at the foot of the stairs and Goggle heard her . " Aw , Ma , " he said . " I 've got a tie . " Actually Goggle had two ties . One was a family plaid , given him as a child . When tied it came down , roughly , to his sternum . The other tie he had won at a party as a prize for something or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture on it . I could really never bring myself to look at it , so my impression of it was rather hazy , but violent . It was my wife 's idea that Goggle should make a selection of ties from my supply . My lack of enthusiasm for this project mystified her . " Let it go , " I said . " If he needs ties he can write to us after he gets there . " I went into his room and looked at the wardrobe and supplies laid out for packing . It seemed like a stage manager 's careful planning for a production that would never come off . I began to pick things up . " Here is your new razor and shaving brush , " I said , in a loud , hearty tone , wondering if a mother felt the same awkwardness about her daughter 's first brassiere . " I wo n't be around to tell you when to take a fast shave , so you 'll have to look in the mirror once in a while . Remember , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grown man than peach fuzz on a boy 's upper lip . It shows he does n't respect himself . Are you listening ? " Goggle was now tying a monkey 's fist knot in a length of cod line . " Huh ? " he said , after a moment . " Listen , " I said , trying to make my exasperation sound like cool reason , " if you do n't do this job with me you wo n't know where your things are . Give a hand here . " " What do you want me to do , " he wailed , quick , adolescent tears springing to his eyes . " Just stand there and hand me things , and watch me , " I said , the bottom dropping out of my stomach , wanting to lock the door and stop the clock and keep us all from ever growing older . We worked in silence for a moment . " Now , " I said quietly , " I think I 've remembered to tell you everything I wanted to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if you draw an absolute stinker , you do n't have to put up with it . Write to Inc . Do n't suffer in silence . You really do n't have to put up with anything , you know . You can always come home . " " Oh , it does n't matter , " Goggle said with gusty despair . " I 'll get some queer who does n't know A from B. It always happens to me . " I reminded myself quickly ( a ) that " queer " did n't have the same connotation for Goggle and his contemporaries that it had for me and mine , ( b ) that Goggle had never been anywhere alone except for one two-week period at a summer camp , so I tried to dismiss from my mind the picture of Goggle as Oliver Twist that his tone had called up . " Here are some envelopes I 've addressed for you , " I said . " Please write to us . I 've tried to make it as easy as possible for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a rainbow after a storm . " If you 'd write the letters , " he said , " all I 'd have to do is sign them and put them in the envelopes . " T ATER , when I had given over to my wife ( it takes a woman to inspire man 's iT work , as I pointed out ) , she said that she saw me wandering outside , looking as if there had been a death in the house . Actually I was indulging in an orgy of sentimental reminiscence , rather like Madame Ranevsky in the last act of " The Cherry Orchard . " Nothing would ever be the same again . There was Goggle 's bicycle propped on the front lawn . The plastic canary with the feather tail , which he had bought with money earned cutting the lawn , was clipped to the handlebar . I would have to tell him to take the bicycle to the basement . Would it molder there ? Would he ever ride it again ? Was it a part of his childhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still hanging from a branch of the pine tree outside his window , the length of radio aerial with a condenser on the end , part of an abandoned project , which I had asked him at least two dozen times to remove . I did not like it there . On windy days it gave our house an air of disaster , as if we had been struck by lightning , or were foundering at sea . Now I did n't think I could bear to have it ever taken away . In the back of the house , from the old oak tree , our tire chains hung from a limb in a similar manner . They had made the ladder by which to climb to the tree house . The tree house itself had been dismantled earlier in the week by Goggle and Alan , who was going away to a4lelifferent school . It had been taken down because " they " ? those secret enemies who lurked everywhere ? might come in and wreck it , or even profane it by using it as a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day when a greater , more magnificent tree house would he constructed . Now I was convinced this would never be . I remembered only too vividly the last construction . It had been a very hot day during the World Series . The architects , to entertain themselves while working , had managed to take a portable radio to the tree by connecting every extension cord in the house . Together with hammering , heated arguments over construction details , the radio tuned to its full volume , I had found it rather difficult to concentrate on my own work in the study inside . After lengthy reflection ( patience , they 're only young once , you 'll lose your temper and make a fool of yourself , your nerves are n't what they used to be ) I had lost my temper , rushed out , where I made a fool of myself , brought about catastrophe. , tears , cessation of all work , both in the tree house and in the study ; and the rest of the afternoon was spent in silence , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by sodas at the drug store . Now I looked at the dismal tire chains . I would never be able to climb up and get them when winter came , and Goggle had forgotten to remove them from the limb where they were nailed . They would hang there and clank and rust , while in the house we grew old and confused and deaf , left alone in our gray backwater of old age . I went around and sat on the front steps . Goggle had sat there beside me on the day when , pale and strained looking , he had asked me where Sing Sine was . He might have to go there some day , he explained . It was n't until a week later that we learned that it had been Goggle who shot out the windows of the new house , with his own little air rifle which I had given him for his birthday . That had been a sentimental crisis . I still had a file of correspondence with insurance company adjusters to prove it . But most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break down and admit his guilt himself . No one had seen him because it was Decoration Day and we were all up at the flagpole with the older boys , watching the American Legion Honor Guard fire its rifles . Btu Goggle had come through . He had admitted it when others were accused . ( Awfully good material for a Presidential campaign . ) It was on the front steps , too , that Goggle 's mother had found him with his arm around the waist of the town flirt , little Alice of the tight pants and the painted toenails . She made the rounds of the town and it had been Goggle 's turn that season , and all that his mother objected to , she said , was his public behavior . While she took him into her room to tell him about women , I sat alone and smoked cigarettes morosely , pondering on the harassed state of man , eternally caught between Mother and That Girl . I was unusually patient with him for the next few days , and in my thoughts I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was shortly after that I felt impelled to give him the Facts of Life Talk , an ill-starred venture which broke down in the middle when we both began laughing too much to talk . We would discuss it in more detail later , I said , lying in my teeth . Goggle would have to learn as I had learned , catch as catch can . - ONE of us felt much like lunch that day , so we decided to start early and stop for a sandwich somewhere along the way . We got the foot locker and the duffel bag and the suitcase into the car . ( Goggle had taken one last magnificent , flying ride on the bicycle , wearing his Mexican hat , before he put it away in the basement . ) When we were ready to get into the car he ran hack for his Biutjachers McnuaL If he wag completely surrounded by dopes he could always tie knots to , pass the time away . He put a great length of rope in the car for this purpose , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could always send it to him . His pockets were stuffed with cod line and that would have to do for the present . It was a beautiful fall day , but we drove unseeingly through the New England hills , where every tree was consuming itself in a great blaze of glory . None of us spoke very much , and when we did think of something to say it came out explosively , too loudly , and then stopped suddenly . Nobody answered . anybody . We stopped for a sandwich , but while we ate it we fed the jukebox with nickels so that we would n't have to talk , and after that , almost before we knew it , we were at the school , placed on its groomed campus as beautiful and complete as a Grant Wood painting . I regretted that I had n't washed the car . The chrome , especially , looked terrible . My wife was too nervous to speak . Her Sunday hat was perched on top of her head . All the women always wore hats when they visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their lives were in immaculate order , and they were clear-eyed , and energetic , and definite , and mothers of men to the teeth , and she wished she could hide somewhere until it was all over . We presented ourselves at the school office , looking like one of those family group snapshots which turn up in the back pages of old photograph albums , where a very possessed " older boy " with a name-plate pinned to his lapel , took us in charge and led us to Goggle 's room . It was impossible to tell how Goggle felt . He had retreated to some ultimate corner of . his being , and on the surface he displayed a nonchalance of manner so advanced that I doubted if he could lift his feet up the stairs . In his room we found ourselves unpacking all the things we had just packed . My wife made the bed , asking him to help , and I asked him to watch where I was putting his things away in the bureau drawers . Goggle heard neither of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pockets and watched the boys arrive . " I am putting your handkerchiefs and socks in the top drawer , " I said , " and your shirts in the second drawer . Arc you listening to me ? " " There 's Jim Halliday ! " Goggle said at the window , and his voice was like the bugle the cavalry used to sound when they came over the hill to save the beleaguered fortress . Goggle 's mother and I looked at each other . Our stiff faces cracked into smiles , and we breathed deeply for the first time that day . We were saved . Goggle never did know until later into what drawers I had put what things . He ran downstairs while we finished the chores , and then we went down to find him . He was standing with Jim Halliday , both of them , hands in trousers pockets , so nonchalant that I felt they ought to be propped against each other to stand . " Hi , " they said . We refrained from overwhelming Jim Halliday with the blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well , and none of us knew lie would be there , and he wo ever know how happy we were to see hit e were nonchalant , too . There was still an hour to go before the boys had to be checked in . Would Goggle like to ride down to the village for a soda ? He walked away with us , but halfway to the car he stopped . " I 'd better not , " he said . " I might miss something . I 'd better stay . Good-by , " he said , just like that . We kissed him on the cheek , lightly . We tried not to touch him with our hands . We smiled . We said good-by , and he walked away from us . We stood and watched him , the boy 's back that was beginning to be a man 's back , the ears that almost looked as if they might belong to his head someday , the feet that he was n't quite used to yet . We got into the car and drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desolate tire chains , the bicycle in the basement . We did n't look at each other , and we did n't speak . 1 r WAS more than six long weeks until Parents ' Day , and every day we went to the post office . During the second week there was one letter . It read as if it had been written at sword 's point . " School , " Goggle wrote , " is , well , okay . Wheh ! " ( We never did find out what that alarming word indicated . ) " I guess it will improve in time , " he went on , " and since there is nothing else to say I will stop . " This , our one letter , was not conducive to long , restful nights in the interim , so we were most anxious for Parents ' Day , even if it did present its special problems . My wife , for example , had nothing at all to wear . She had had nothing new at all for years , as she pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing now , but everything she owned was either too city , too country , or too in-between . She was in despair . She would just have to go into town and see what she could do . I had a problem myself , as I pointed out . Because of my unfortunate tendency to find too much pleasure in serious things , I might embarrass Goggle . " I ca n't go around grinning at everybody , " I said . " They would n't understand . " So I commissioned my wife to go to Brooks and buy me a Proper Tie . " Not a Sincere Tie , " I explained . " A Solemn Tie . A tie that will say to me when I look in a mirror : you are a father , a pillar of the community , a staunch patriot , and a voter of the straight ticket . " My wife protested that this was asking a lot of a tie , but 1 waved her objections aside . " Brooks will understand , " I said loftily . " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit his son in boarding school . They have cross-references for that sort of thing . " My wife left for town before dawn and came back at five completely exhausted butstill in despair . She had not found a thing . She was carrying a box and it had a dress in it , but she was going to send it back in the morning . " I just brought it home to show you the kind of thing I had to put up with , " she explained , taking her shoes off to rub her feet . I made commiserating noises for her , and thought commiserating thoughts for the salespeople , and then I asked about my tie . She had it and it was perfect . It was dark brown and green in regimental stripes . It looked like the sort of tie you could n't possibly buy . You just had it , like those hats triat are said to be worn by Boston matrons . My satisfaction cheered my wife enough to go upstairs and try on all her clothes again . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds that anything new would make her feel uncomfortable anyway . Thus attired we set out , late in the afternoon on the day before Parents ' Day . In our concern to do justice to Goggle we were even later than we had intended ( my shaving lotion was far too fragrant , I decided , after I was completely dressed , and my wife tried on all of her earrings before she decided to wear none at all ) and so we did n't arrive in time for the junior football game . Goggle , we were informed when we arrived , was in the dressing room . He would meet us in the Hall ( called just " Hall " without the article ) for tea . We went to Hall , where I immediately made a search for a mirror to look at my tie , the idea of meeting my son for tea already breaking down all of my resolutions to be a solemn , proper parent . Tea turned out to he cocoa in paper cups , which made me feel I might get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in front of the fireplace and sipped it , Goggle appeared . It was an occasion which a certain beer company should immortalize under its heading of Great Moments in the Lives of American Families . There was Goggle , scrubbed and shining , peach-fuzz-free , his shoes polished , his socks straight ; wearing flannel trousers , a jacket , a button-down shirt , and a bow tie in regimental stripes . We stared at each other across the room , and then , with an expression which I will never forget ? Goggle looked us up and down to see if we were properly dressed ! We moved toward each other , too oppressively and breathlessly nonchalant to say anything but , " Hi . " We smiled at each other shyly . " New tie ? " Goggle asked . " Yes , " I said , looking with awe at his own . " Did you tie it yourself ? " I whispered . " Of course , " Goggle said casually . I looked around . The room was filling up . As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , all wearing bow ties in regimental stripes which they had tied themselves . Brooks had not failed me . I was in . " Wo n't you sit down , Mother ? " Goggle said . Goggle 's mother sat down . Cocoa choked in her throat and trembled in the cup in her hand , and I said something loudly , quickly , jokingly , seeing with alarm the sudden moist brightness of her eyes . E STAYED the night at the Inn ( re-stored as of January I , 1776 , with plumbing /aid on ) and the next day passed as in a pleasant dream . I had The Tie , which I fingered surreptitiously at dangerous moments , and I got though all of it safely . There was the anxious gravity of the everlast-ing football game with the school 's traditional rival , which we won ; there was chicken a la king in Hall ; and interspersed with all , the manly talks with the young masters , all of whom wore tweeds , smoked pipes , and had either two , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked a cake , and we had that with cokes in Goggle 's room , while other boys wandered in and out , speaking the incomprehensible shorthand of boarding school jargon . It was almost dusk before Goggle made us go home . We found we were laughing this time as we got into the car and drove away . We felt young again and happy , and we held hands . " Let 's stop and have dinner at a very nice place , " my wife said . " With a cocktail First . " " Or maybe two cocktails , " I said . We did n't try to put it into words then , but a wonderful , miraculous hope had begun to blossom in our hearts . I thought of all those endless talks we had had about boarding school ; the sleepless nights of indecision . But Goggle had looked at us when he talked . He had listened when we spoke to him . It was even possible that , in time , he might come to see us as human beings , separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
