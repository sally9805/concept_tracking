Trinity Methodist Church in Los Angeles found a new way to increase Sunday-school attendance last week : it got Hollywood Cowboy Roy Rogers to come and bring his clever blond horse Trigger . <P> Before Sunday school , in the street out side , Rogers mounted and put Trigger through some of his famous paces , e.g. , bowing and hula-hula prancings . " This happens to be Trigger 's first appearance in church , " Rogers told the crowd of youngsters . " He should have started long ago . . . Here you learn how to love one another and mom and pop . " He led Trigger into the church annex , posed for pictures ( Trigger on haunches ) . After the horse had been led outside again , Rogers continued his remarks . " This is God 's day , " he said , " and I 'm tickled to death to do things for Him . " Attendance : 1,800 children and parents . Attendance the Sunday before : 1,400.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
