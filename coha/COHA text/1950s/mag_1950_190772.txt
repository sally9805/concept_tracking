BATTLE OF INDOCHINA <P> Last week the Communist high command , facing defeat in Korea , struck a major counterblow in Indo-China . Within a few days , the Communists forced the French to abandon a whole line of forts and thereby wrecked the French plan of containing and eventually starving out the rebels . At week 's end the Moscow newspapers were giving as much space to Indo-China as to Korea . <P> Indo-China adjoins Red China , but the border has never been pegged out . The real frontier is a string of French forts and outposts connected by a road called Route Coloniale No. 4 which winds between steep hills and dense forests . The French Foreign Legionnaires who man the forts say : " The Route Coloniale No. 4 is a road a man travels only once alive . " In a bitter five-day battle fought with the Communists last week on Route No. 4 , over 3,000 Foreign Legionnaires were trapped . <P> The forts were to cut off Ho Chi Minh 's Viet Minh rebel Communist army from the Chinese Communists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild hilly country which lies between the frontier and the Red River to the west . By holding the frontier and the good rice lands of the Red River delta the French hoped to starve out the Communists . For a while it looked as if the plan might work . Ho 's radio exhorted his supporters to save rice , " every grain as precious as a drop of blood . " <P> Last June , before the beginning of the war in Korea , documents captured by the French convinced them that Ho was about to receive extensive aid from Communist China 's Mao Tse-tung . Mao , the French said , was training thousands of picked rebel Viet Minh troops in China and was equipping Ho 's forces with heavy weapons . The Ho-Mao objective : the Red River delta . The time : after the summer monsoon and before the November rice harvest . <P> Soldiers Who Melt Away . A month ago , French fears materialized . Four Viet Minh battalions attacked Dongkhe ( see map ) , a fort at the north end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which they had had before . The French staff decided to withdraw from Caobang , a fort a few miles to the north of Dongkhe . <P> To cover the withdrawal they planned to attack Ho in his own " military capital , " Thainguyen , a town 40 miles north of Hanoi . On Oct. 1 a combined French force of parachutists , infantry and naval units struck at Thainguyen . The operation was perfectly carried out in Western military style , but after a few skirmishes , the Viet Minh defenders melted away . <P> Meanwhile , a column of crack French troops was on its way to protect the withdrawal from Caobang . The Caobang garrison had already pulled out and was on its way south through the jungle . The two French columns met on Route Coloniale No. 4 between Dongkhe and Thatkhe . Numbering together more than 3,000 men , they marched southward for two days . Then , in a narrow valley , a force of 20,000 Viet Minh soldiers descended on them . Only about 700 Legionnaires managed to escape the ambuscade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were killed &; wounded , another 1,000 taken prisoner .
