 | He drew his folded cap out of his pocket and put it on his head . " Good-by , " he said again . They stared at him , still unanswering , and upon the strength of his continuing anger he strode out of the room and across the weedy yard to the gate which hung crooked upon its hinges . He leaped over it and marched down the road , his head high , to meet a world he did not know . Despair drove him and lent him courage , and then the beauty of the land lifted his heart . Surely somewhere there were kind people , someone like Mr. Fong , who would recognize him and give him shelter for a while . He would work and repay all that he received and some day he would , after all , come back and see the wretched children he had left in that kitchen . He had gone perhaps a mile when he heard the sound of feet padding in the dusty road . He stopped and turning his head he saw Bump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want , Bump ? " lie asked the sandy-faced , sandy-haired child who blinked at him , panting . The signs of hominy were still about his mouth . " I 'm comin ' with you , " he gasped . Clem glared at him , for a moment resentful of the least of burdens . Then his conscience leaped into life again . Surely he could take this small creature with him , wherever he went , a younger brother . " All right , " he said shortly . " Conic along . "  | III IN MID-AUGUST the newspaper headlines had announced the end of the siege in Peking , and a cablegram from 1 ) r . Lane brought the news that he intended to stay . The Imperial Court had fled , and the Old Empress had wailed aloud her hardships . She had not even been given time to comb her hair , and her breakfast on the day of the flight had been only a hard-boiled egg . " Serves her right , " Mrs. Lane said briskly . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to your father . But you 'll be able to manage by yourself if I get your clothes ready before I go . " William went to Cambridge for his final examinations in September . He had missed the preliminaries but Mrs. Lane had herself gone to the dean with a certificate signed by the headmaster of the Chefoo Boys ' School . She had so talked and persuaded and demanded that the dean was much impressed and granted her son a certain clemency , and William was admitted conditionally . He was confident that whatever promises his mother had made to the dean , he could iii tlhc course of four years fulfill . Indeed , he preferred not to know all that his mother had said and done for him . Thus he did not know , though he suspected , that the admirable arrangement he had made with Mr. Cameron to be Jeremy 's roommate , and when necessary his tutor , had taken shape first in the active brain of his mother . Mrs. Lane , before she went back to China , had chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron . She had grown friendly if not intimate with them during the summer when William had gone almost every afternoon to play tennis at the house on top of the cliff . He had asked her to call upon Mrs. Cameron , stipulating that neither of his sisters nor his grandmother was to go with her . " The Camerons are the kind of people I belong with , " he had explained . " I want them to know I have a mother 1 need not be ashamed of . Nobody else matters . " Mrs. Lane was touched . " Thank you , dear . " The formal call had gone off well , and Mrs. Cameron had explained that she must be forgiven if she could not return it , since in the summer she made no calls . Mrs. Lane and William were , however , invited to dinner within the month . After the evening pleasantly spent by  | Mrs. Lane 's talking about the Empress Dowager and the magnificence of Peking , it had occurred to the indomitable mother that a problem which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of all her efforts , it was clear that William would be compelled to earn money somehow during college , and she could not imagine how this was to be done . She had inquired of the dean , and he had suggested waiting on table or washing dishes . This suggestion she had accepted with seeming gratitude but she knew it was impossible . William would not wait upon anyone nor would he wash dishes . It would be impossible to make him . She remembered the delightful evening in the great seaside house . It was a pity , she had thought , that the heir to all the wealth was only a pale sickly boy . William would so have enjoyed it , would have been so able to spend it well , looking handsome and princely all the while . She had thought deeply for some weeks , and had at last decided to call one last time upon the Camerons . She wrote h short note to Mrs. Cameron , was grateful for all the kindnesses of the summer , mentioned her impending return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and friendless here , and asked permission to come and say good-by . When Mrs. Cameron telephoned her to say they would be at home on a certain Sunday , thither she went , at five o'clock . The butler ushered her into the drawing room , where Mrs. Cameron sat doing nothing while Mr. Cameron read the Transcript . " Do sit down , " Mrs. Cameron said , and made a graceful motion with her ringed left hand . " Thank you , " Mrs. Lane replied . She had spent a good deal of thought upon her costume for this occasion . It should be plain , but not poor . It must convey good taste and a civilized mind . Knowing the ready impatience of the rich , she had begun upon her theme as soon as Mr. Cameron put down his paper to greet her . " Do n't let me interrupt your reading , " she said . " I have come for a very few minutes to say good-by  --  and for one more purpose . It is about William . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired . " He has always done very well in school , " Mrs. Lane said . " We expect that . His father was graduated from Harvard summa cum laude . No , the concern is in my own heart . William is so young , so lonely . Ile has no one to take his parents ' place . His grandparents , my father and mother , are old and they can scarcely understand him . They have the responsibility of the girls , too . My husband 's parents are dead and  | the family scattered . If I could feel that William would be able to look to you and Mrs. Cameron for guidance  --  through Jeremy ? " " He can always come here , " Mrs. Cameron said in a mild voice . " I 'm sure there is plenty of room . " Mrs. Lane sighed . " Thank you , dear Mrs. Cameron . I dread the long vacations . His father says he must work and earn part of his way , but what does William know about such things ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cameron said . Mrs. Lane agreed quickly . " That is just what his father says , and I am sure you are both right . Please , Mr. Cameron , for the first summer at least , could you help to find something suitable for my boy , something that will not lead him into bad company ? He does n't know his own American people yet . " " Oh well , " Mr. Cameron said . " I can do that . There are always jobs waiting for young men , if they are the right sort . I supported myself entirely after I was fifteen , as a matter of fact . " Mrs. Lane proceeded bravely to the most difficult part of her purpose . " I am going to ask something really bold , dear Mr. Cameron . Do you think that William could be useful somehow to your son ? Could he not perhaps look after him , help him even with his lessons ? When ? if , of course  --  he should be ill , William could look out for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes for him  --  that sort of thing . " Mrs. Lane was faltering under Roger Cameron 's stern eyes , and she looked pleadingly at Mrs. Cameron for relief . To her joy she saw a mild approval there . " It might be a good idea , Roger , " Mrs. Cameron said . " William 's a proud sort of fellow , " Roger replied . " Not too proud to help his friend , " Mrs. Lane said . " William is a Christian boy , Mr. Cameron . " Roger pursed his lips . " How much do you expect me to pay him ? " Mrs. Lane knew her battle was over . She shook her head and folded her hands in her lap . " Please do n't ask me that , Mr. Cameron . I trust your judgment  --  and your generosity . I wish there need be no talk of money  --  it 's so dreadful . Had my husband remained in this country instead of choosing poverty upon the mission field ... but no matter ! " She smiled sadly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of news from her husband 's recent letters , she rose to say good-by . She clasped Mrs. Cameron 's hand between both her own and smiled bravely . " I can not tell you how safe I feel now about William . I leave him in your care , dear friends . "  | Mr. and Mrs. Cameron bowed , still looking a little bewildered . When the door had closed they sat down again exactly as they were before and Mr. Cameron picked up the Transcript . Neither of them spoke for a few minutes , and Mrs. Cameron gazed out of the window into the garden . " It is a good thing that William Lane is so handsome , " she said at last . " We really wo n't mind having him about . Candy says he is clever . I do hope he will always be good to Jeremy . Sometimes I think there is something cruel about his mouth . His hands are small for such a tall boy . Have you noticed that ? I always think small hands mean cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when she did a little rush of words came from her lips , as though reserve had temporarily been removed . Mr. Cameron listened , still reading the paper . " It wo n't hurt Jeremy to have a strong young fellow around to keep him lively . " Mrs. Cameron did not reply for some little time . Then she said , " As for vacations , you must not forget that Candace is also in the house . The two of them , both being so healthy , will want to play games together . . . . I should n't at all like her to marry the son of a missionary . " " Candy will marry whom she pleases , " Mr. Cameron said . He loved his daughter and was proud of her , though with steady pessimism . Sooner or later the young always betrayed the old . " Do keep quiet , there 's a good girl , " he went on . " This Bryan is putting me into a state , even on Sunday . He 'll be the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he know about those foreigners over there ? " Mrs. Cameron fell silent , and Mr. Cameron read the paper with fury , chewing the yellowed ends of his mustache . The examinations were easily passed , for which William was grateful to the hard grueling of English schoolmasters . He was practical enough to realize that he could also thank his own talents and ambition . It was intolerable for him not to ( 10 well and so he did well . WhGn Mr. Cameron had asked him to come and see him , one day after his mother had sailed for China , he went with some excitement within , although with entire calm upon his surface . His mother had told him , not quite truthfully perhaps , what Mr. Cameron would talk about . " He has some idea that you might be a sort  --  of tutor for Jeremy , " she had said that last day . " Do n't get proud and refuse it , William . Remember the alternative is dishwashing or waiting on the college  | tables . Besides , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will have the chance to live in those beautiful rooms . I do n't think I could get you in there otherwise . " The beautiful rooms , he had already discovered , were on that short and noble street called the Gold Coast . There the sons of the wealthy lived like young princes in suites of rooms with separate bedrooms , a private bath , and a shared living room . Anything less seemed impossible to William . He made up his mind that he would accept whatever Mr. Cameron offered . He was pleasantly grateful , then , when the offer was made . " I leave it to you , " Mr. Cameron said , " to see how you can help my boy . You know him pretty well now , do n't you ? " " I think so , " William said , and he added quite sincerely , " At least I like him more than any boy I 've ever known . " " That 's good , " Mr. Cameron said with more heartiness than usual . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful , you know  --  that 's very important . We do n't believe in medication . It 's very important to believe in the power of mind over matter . " " Yes , sir , " William said . " Now , " Mr. Cameron went on . " Will a hundred dollars a month be about right ? " " Whatever you say , sir , " William replied . He was startled by the amount , but he would not show his amazement . " Well , if you find it is n't enough you can let me know , " Mr. Cameron said . " And look here , one more thing , what say we keep this little arrangement to ourselves ? It might make Jeremy feel queer with you . He 's democratic and all that . " " You mean just you and me , sir ? " He thought of Candace . He did not want her to know that her father was paying him . " Just us , " Mr. Cameron said . " Of course , Mrs. Cameron knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I tell her not to , and she is n't interested in details . " " I 'd like it , " William said . " That is , sir , I 'd like to forget it myself , so that I wo n't be thinking of money in connection with Jeremy . " " No , no , " Mr. Cameron said , quite pleased . " I 'll just ask him if he will let me room with him , " William suggested . " That 's right , " Mr. Cameron said . " You fix it up and on the first of every month there 'll be a check . " The outcome of this was that when the two young men entered college , William found himself on the Gold Coast , with a bedroom  | of his own across the pleasant living room from Jeremy 's . Mrs. Cameron came with them and spent a week furnishing the rooms properly . There was even a small grand piano for Jeremy to use . William , secure in the monthly check , spent the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxuries that she had not been able to persuade the agitated mission treasurer to include in his necessities , a handsome set of razors , some silk pajamas , a blue brocaded satin dressing gown and leather slippers to match . Thus William began his four years of college . He was reserved , modest , and dignified , and took his work with secret seriousness , though outward ease . He fulfilled exactly his every obligation to Jeremy and was at once kind and stern . I le felt sometimes that Jeremy did not like him but he did not allow this to disturb him . The brilliance of his own academic standing was answer enough . Among the hundreds of young men who were matriculated at Harvard that year , William was notable . In prudence he made no close friends as the months passed , but he surveyed the Gold Coast carefully . It did not occur to him to search for friends outside that bright area . He marked here and there men whom he might cultivate as time went on . There was plenty of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who attracted him above all others , a handsome fellow who lived in Westmorly , too careless to be ambitious for hi ; li marks with his professors , too self-confident to consider marks of first importance . He had already his group of friends , in the upper classes as well as among the freshmen , for he had prepared at Groton . Ile did many things well . He sang in the freshman glee club , he was a fine oarsman , and he was already marked for those clubs which William exceedingly desired to enter . Franklin Roosevelt was the mail , William told himself , that he would like to have been , his father rich and his mother secure in her place in American society . Having everything , the gay and handsome boy could say what he liked , could believe as he felt , behave as he willed . In the election that autumn he was for Bryan , although his own cousin , Theodore Roosevelt , was running for vice-president , and he flouted England by raising money for the Boers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have taken sides against England even though he could not approve the Boers , or disapprove the English , and he envied the case with which it seemed that Franklin did both , without liking the Boers or disliking the English . For some reason which William could not comprehend , there seemed to be such an overflow in this youth , such a limitless privilege , that  | he made a habit of believing that the poor , the uneducated , the miserable must be championed , although without hatred of the oppressor . William knew nothing of South Africa . That he might prove to himself at least that the man he unwillingly admired was wrong he began for the first time in his life to read newspapers and to perceive , though dimly , how omnipotent they were . Even he was dependent upon them to shape his own opinions about the war . He was convinced from what he read that England was right and that the Boers were coarse farmers , ignorant dwellers upon the soil . When he announced this opinion , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered only by loud though pleasant laughter . His opponent refused to argue . He did not care what William believed . The tall young man did other things more amazing . Ile helped the men who lived in the Yard , in the cheap dormitories and in even cheaper rooming houses , and the day students , to organize themselves and win the class elections away from the little group that had always won them . The Gold Coast inhabitants sneered . " Anything to get himself popular ! " William listened and said little . He was cautious in the world of his own country , still so new to him , and being insecure and unready to take what he felt was his proper part , he hovered near the young Roosevelt who had no doubts and behaved like the prince of a royal house . He made his approach of friendship tentatively slight , a conversation in the dining room at Memorial Hall , a chance to walk together to separate classrooms . Roosevelt answered without assuming superiority and was mildly interested to hear of . William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fortune in China and his grandmother in her twenties had visited the fashionable parts of Hong Kong and Canton . Upon this slight interest William built his hopes . Of all the young men he knew or saw , this one was most nearly his equal , most fitted for friendship . Why that friendship did not grow , why the hoped for companionship faded , William never knew . It was a bud that did not bloom . Franklin Roosevelt 's greetings were carelessly kind , but he had no time . There was never a time for talk , no time for companionship , and William , too sensitive , withdrew into cold and secret criticism . He was reminded of the English days in the Chefoo school . Because he was not allowed to love , he took shelter again in hatred . The fellow , he told himself , wanted to run the college . When both of them were chosen for the staff of the college newspaper , the Crimson , William  | felt himself freeze toward the young man who was still too happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in William 's sophomore year , his father stood on the balcony of Mr. Fong 's bookshop . Dr. Lane knew Peking well , and the day before he had walked along the street judging each house for its view of the Great North Gate , through which on this day , the seventh day of the Western first month , the Old Empress with her Imperial Court was to return to the palace . Dr. Lane did not know Mr. Fong and it was by the merest chance that he saw above this bookshop the narrow balcony to which one must climb by a ladder , since it was merely a facade upon the roof . From it , however , was the best possible view of the great event of tomorrow . Dr. Lane went into the bookshop and bowed to Mr. Fong , who stood behind the counter reading an old book he had bought from the library of a man recently dead . Since the man had no sons and none of the females of the house could read , there was no more use for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elder Brother ? " Mr. Fong inquired . He was polite to all foreigners because , being a good man , he was sorry for everything that had happened . While he could not say that he was glad that his country was defeated , for he put no more trust in foreign governments than in his own , yet he grieved that foreigners and Chinese had been killed . Especially was he ashamed of the folly of the Old Woman who had put her faith in the society of ignorant then called Boxers . She deserved the catastrophe that had befallen her when she had been compelled to flee the city in such haste , seventeen months ago . So impetuous had been the Court 's flight , as Mr. Fong heard , that more people had been killed by the Imperial Guard in getting t lie Old Buddha out of the city than the foreign soldiers had killed when they came in . It was ever at last , to the disgrace of all concerned , and pity to those dead , both Chinese and foreign , and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of a foreign face now that it was safe to be friendly . Dr. Lane replied with equal politeness . " I wish to rent a few feet of your excellent balcony tomorrow in order that I may see the return of the Empress Dowager . " Mr. Fong was surprised . " Elder Brother , are you and the elder brothers of your country pleased to see her return ? " " At least I am , " Dr. Lane said . " I believe that the people need their  | government and I have every hope that the Empress will have learned her lesson and that she will allow the young Emperor to put in reforms . " " Western elder brothers have more faith in women than we have , " Mr. Fong replied . " Whether Elder Brother is right I do not know and it is always likely that I am wrong . I could not take money for the balcony . Pray use it , as though it were your own . " After some minutes of such talk , Mr. Fong finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much since the foreigners were eagerly buying whatever space they could find . Chinese would not of course be allowed to see the royal return . All doors were to be barred , all windows closed , and blue cotton curtains were even now being hung across side streets and alleyways , so that no common eye could look upon the Old Buddha . Foreigners could not be thus controlled since they were the victors in the brief war . " You know , Elder Brother , " Mr. Fong remarked when the transaction was over , " I feel more than usually unhappy to take silver from you because I had once in this house a clever small brother of your people . " " Indeed ! " " Yes , " Mr. Fong said , stroking his sparse beard . " I lc came to teach my son a foreign language . He did not take money for pay . Instead he asked for my foreign books , of which I have a few . Servants steal such books from their foreign masters to sell for a few coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who was this foreign boy ? " Dr. Lane asked . " You remember the god-man who was killed , lie and his wife and children ? The one who was always begging for bread ? " " I do , indeed , " Dr. Lane said . He remembered very well that the Miller family had been found lying in their own blood , but the boy was not there , nor had he ever been heard of , although the American officials had made efforts to trace him . " The boy was here , " Mr. Fong said solemnly . I-Ic tapped his polished wooden counter with his long fingernail . " here lie was in my house . He came early to teach my son . Thus he escaped death . Surely there was meaning in it . I have considered it a good omen for my house . " " What became of him ? " Dr. Lane asked with intense interest . " He came back , " Mr. Fong said . " And he told me what he had found in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape . Then I told him to go east to the sea and to find a foreign ship and to return to his own land and his father 's father 's house . "  | " That was very good of you , " Dr. Lane said . " I shall report this to the American officials . " " Please do not do so , " Mr. Fong said hastily . " It is better not to tell anyone so long as the Old Woman is alive . She will come back smiling , as you will see tomorrow , but who will know what is in her heart ? " Who indeed could know ? Dr. Lane himself would never wholly recover from the long siege within the Legation Quarters . He had caught dysentery in the heat of that summer , and was nearly dead when at Iast the soldiers from the West came surging into the city . When his wife came back to him from America , after William was safely in college , she had tried to make him give up China . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have done nothing yet , " he replied . It was the beginning of the long struggle between them over whether China was worth his life . " See how many foreigners have been killed ! " she had cried passionately . " Hundreds of us have been saved , and by six men , " he had retorted . It was true . Junglu , the favorite of the Empress Dowager , had done all he could to save the foreigners from her fury . Yuan-cheng and Hsu Ching-cheng had deliberately changed the word " slay , " in the royal edict , to " protect . " Li-shad , Liu-yuan , and Hsu Tung-i the Empress had put to death for opposing the war against the foreigners . And there were the noble host , those whom tic never forgot , the thousands of Chinese Christians , more than two score of them of his own church here in Peking , who had refused to give up their faith and who died , martyrs for a god who to them was a foreign one . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife 's power , strong woman though she was , to move him from his own faith , not only in God but in the Chinese people . " I will be here tomorrow , " he promised Mr. Fong . Thus on the next day Dr. Lane stood upon the balcony , wrapped in a thick quilted Chinese robe inside of which he still shivered . Mrs. Lane had refused to stand there with him , when looking out from the window of their bedroom this morning , she had seen the city shrouded in yellow dust from the deserts of the northwest . A bitter wind was blowing , even then . Dr. Lane had been slightly exasperated to perceive it , for it added to the honor of the Imperial return . It was an ancient tradition in the city that whenever an emperor left his palace a strong wind would go with him , and would bring him back again . Heaven itself seemed to be on the side of the Old Buddha .  | While he waited on the balcony in the fury of the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fong had told him . The Miller boy had doubtless done exactly what his Chinese friend had bade him . 1Ir might now be safely in America . He must write and tell William of the possibility . He had reported the story to the American officials yesterday , concealing Mr. Fong 's name . He glanced with concern at the great gate . There was still no sign of the royal entourage . Helen had been wise , perhaps , to content herself with seeing the Empress at the mighty reception which she was to give to her conquerors when she reached the Imperial Palace . Yet he did not want to attend it . He was not dazzled by her arrogant and heathen splendor . He hoped to see her as she came in the North Gate and to discern for himself whether she had repented . He had prayed solemnly that her heart might be softened for the good of the people . He did not honestly know whether such prayers were answered . Everything was in readiness for the moment at the gate . Across the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls and booths . The street had been swept clean and spread with bright yellow sand , yellow , the imperial color . No common man was on the street . The imperial guard stood waiting , and princes and dukes were ready each with his own banner corps . Here and there down the street foreigners stood at windows , a few opened by permission that the visitors might witness the return . Mr. Fong 's head appeared above the edge of the ladder . He held out a small brass handstove . " Take this , Elder Brother , " he whispered . " I have put fresh coals in it . " Dr. Lane took the handstove gratefully and before he could speak his thanks Mr. Fong was gone . Now he perceived certain signs . A line of Chinese heads would appear here and there over a rooftop , instantly to disappear again . Word was running through the city that the Old Buddha was near . She had descended from the train . For the first time in her life the Old Buddha had ridden on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had not enjoyed it . The dust had been suffocating , the noise insupportable . When the whistle blew she had been terrified and indignant , and when she learned that this was the duty of the engineer she sent word by a eunuch that he was not to blow it without telling her before he did it . The railway from Paoting to Peking had been destroyed during the war and rebuilt again under the foreign victors and the foreign soldiers had brought it into the very heart of the city , tearing great holes in the walls . The Old Buddha would not pass through these desecrated walls . She had ordered the court to alight  | outside and to enter their royal palanquins , that they might return to the city in proper state through the great gate . Dr. Lane , holding the little handstove , heard a rising shout . A small army of eunuchs on horseback galloped from the gate . They wore black caps with red feathers and on the breasts of their robes were huge medallions of red and yellow embroidery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high voice that the Imperial Court was returned . All those officials waiting on the street fell to their knees and bowed their faces into the dust . Dr. Lane leaned on the frail banisters of the balcony and stared down into the street , and the destiny of this moment was impressed upon him . He watched everything , intent to remember it all , to tell William . He saw the Imperial Guard , followed by military officers . Great flags of yellow satin swirled in the wind , and upon each was embroidered a blue dragon swallowing a red sun . On either side of the flags were the imperial banners embroidered with the imperial arms . Behind these rode the young Emperor , a sad young man , sitting within his yellow palanquin , which was lined with blue silk . The curtain was up and there he sat , his face unmoved , gazing straight ahead . He sat upon his crossed feet iii the position of a Buddha . " The sacrifice of youth , " Dr. Line murmured to nobody . Death was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the Impress herself . He was indignant to see the redoubtable figure , seated in her great palanquin in the midst of her guards , followed by the young Empress and the court ladies . Upon that gay and wicked old visage there was nothing but the liveliest pleasure . Seeing the foreigners , who were her conquerors , she had put aside the curtains of the palanquin and waved her handkerchief at them . He was the more indignant to see some of the foreign ladies , among whom he recognized Americans , too , wave back to the old sinner , laughing as they did so . Thus quickly was all forgot . He came down from the balcony and returned the handstove ' to Mr. Fong with thanks . " How did the Old Woman look ? " Mr. Fong inquired . " She has not repented , " Dr. Lane said grimly . " Did I not tell you ? " Mr. Fong replied and he laughed , though his face was full of rue . William Lane remembered suddenly in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not read his father 's letter . He had got it in the morning with other letters , one of them from  | Candace , and hers he had read first . He wanted very much to be in love with Candace , and most of the time now he thought he was . The obstacle to his complete conviction was simple enough  --  herself . She expected from him a quality of attendance , a constant gallantry , which he found little short of degrading . For a woman to be beautiful was entirely necessary in his eyes . He despised his sister Henrietta for her plain face . Candace was beautiful enough to satisfy him , could he subdue her other less-attractive qualities . At the moment , however , his relation with Candace was puzzling and exciting . He felt at a disadvantage , there was so much he did not know because he had not always lived in his own country . The secret hostility he had always felt toward his father for compelling him to be born the son of a missionary in China was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of this he loved his father in a strange half-hating fashion , and some of his darkest moods were those in which he brooded upon what his father might have been had he not heard the unfortunate call of God . Handsome itu face , winning in manner , a leader of men , there was no reason , William thought when his fancy was rampant , why his father might not have gone into politics and even become the President of the United States . There was nothing wonderful about Theodore Roosevelt . William spent a good deal of time studying that bumptious angular face . Anybody coulcl be President ! He pulled his father 's letter from his pocket and saving the Chinese stamp for Jeremy , he tore the envelope and took out the sheets of thin paper , lined closely with the delicate and familiar handwriting . He was quite aware that his father always took pains to communicate with him on equal terms , and especially to tell him constantly what was happening in the land that had been left behind . William was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the dear only son would come back to China , to be a better missionary than anyone had ever been before , to persuade the changing nation toward God . Some day or other , William knew , he would have to destroy this dream , but he had not yet the courage for it . He slid not put it in terms of courage . He told himself that he was only waiting for the moment when it would hurt his father least . Now quickly and carelessly he read what his father had written slowly and with care . I told you of the pending return of the Court . Now it has come . It was a strange and barbaric sight , a motley crowd of rascals ruled over by a feminine tyrant , and yet somehow there was magnificence  | in it , too , a sort of wild and natural glory , the atmosphere which the Chinese can manage so well in whatever they do . The Old Empress is too great a person , in spite of her monstrous evil , to remain ungenerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault , and now she sees that she must begin reforms for the people . Even before the return she issued an edict demanding that the officials of the empire immediately learn all about political science and international law . She has given them six months in which to complete this task , upon pain of death . Six months . There speaks the old ignorance and the new ! Perhaps more exciting , because more practicable , is the fact that she has appointed a commission to draft a public school system , the first that China has ever had . Some day the old examinations will be entirely abolished and China will be modern . It may happen before you finish college , dear boy , so that when you come back it will be to another country altogether , one which you can help to build . But I do not wish to speak only of China . Tell me about yourself at college . What you say of Jeremy seems pleasant and good . What fortune to find such a friend ! I had feared loneliness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have not their exact experience . Give him my warm regards . Your mother is writing you tomorrow , she says , about the reception which the Old Empress held f all the foreigners . It was a great affair . All the diplomats and their wives went and so far as I can learn from your mother , the Empress behaved exactly as though she had won the war and was graciously meeting her captives and freeing prisoners . So successful was she that a number of ladies capitulated to her frightful charm . I myself refused to go . I could not stomach having to be polite to that female personification of the Evil One . Your mother was not so scrupulous and apparently enjoyed herself . His father 's letters always took him back to China , however much he might resist . He could see clearly that bold figure of the Old Empress , great enough to accept defeat lightly and so be still imperial , still powerful . There was power in her which William felt was sacred , compelling a quality in himself which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood to his full height of six feet one , he felt the excitement of his ambition surging into his body and his mind . He was drawn always to the powerful and the proud . Once he had passed  | the famous president of the university crossing the yard with an enormous watermelon under his arm , and he never felt the same respect again for him . Whatever the genius of Charles Eliot , and William acknowledged genius , it was lessened by the man 's lack of pride . Nothing could have persuaded William to carry even a bundle under his arm . Indeed , few of his professors fulfilled his secret expectations . It was hard to give high respect to a pudgy philosopher with a big head thatched with rough yellowish gray hair covered with an old tiredlooking hat , or a little man with a high forehead and a shaggy disheveled mustache . Two men alone satisfied his instinct for dignity and seriousness . One was a great handsome German who looked like the Kaiser and taught psychology with the voice of a thundering god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniard , whose eyes were dark and cold . Under George Santayana alone William sat with complete reverence . The man was an aristocrat . The same absolute and delicate pride he had seen long ago in the Chinese Empress , a quality which could not stoop to common folk . For William democracy meant no more than that from among the common mass a king might arise , a Carlylean hero , a leader unexplained . People tried to explain such persons by many myths of virgin births and immaculate conceptions . Chinese history , he had often heard his father say , was rich with such myths . The unexplained great men , born of ordinary parents must , the people felt , be the sons of gods . In the dark depths of his emotions William acknowledged the possibility of explanation . How explain himself ? There was no one in his family like him . He could not be explained any more than the Chinese Empress could be , for she was born the ( laughter of a common small military official . Somewhere in the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invincible combination . I lc would never forget the haughty face of the indomitable ruler bent above him , a young American boy . It had been his first glimpse of greatness and it remained in him , a permanent influence . So William created his world in his own image . The sons of gods were the saviors of mankind and they lived upon the Gold Coast , anywhere in the world . William folded his father 's letter and saw on the back of the sheet one further note : By the by , here is something interesting . You remember the Faith Mission family Miller , who were killed by the Boxers . Actually the  | boy escaped . Quite by accident I met a Chinese who had saved his life and sent him on his way to the coast . From there , if he got a ship , he may have reached America safely  --  may be there now , under God 's care . This news did not interest William . That brief and humiliating moment in the dusty Peking street was repulsive even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threw it into the wastepaper basket under the desk . In William 's junior year he reached his final hatred of Franklin Roosevelt when Roosevelt was chosen president of the Crimson . William had supposed himself secure for the place and he did not know why he had failed . He was not able to hide his disappointment from Jeremy , always quick to feel suffering in anyone else . " Sorry , William , " Jeremy said . " You would have done a magnificent job . " " It does n't matter , " William said with a grimace . " Do n't be ashamed of feeling , " Jeremy said gently . William allowed a few words to escape from his vast inner misery . " It seems unjust that I should n't get it , and that fellow got it so easily . " He saw Jeremy looking at him with a peculiar and pitying gaze and he averted his eyes . " I 'd like to say something to you , William , if you 'll let me , " Jeremy said after a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh . " Perhaps we ca n't say such things to each other . We never have , somehow . Perhaps if we could we would both feel better . " " Say what you like , " William said . I lc sat down abruptly at the desk and pretended to fill his fountain pen with ink . " Roosevelt has got everything he wanted because he is warm toward everybody . He is full of a sort of  --  of  --  love , if you know what I mean . " " I 'm afraid I do n't , " William said . " IIe is full of loose ideas , so far as I am concerned . " " I know some of his ideas are crazy , " Jeremy admitted . " But everything else about him is so right that he can just about think as he likes . " William dropped the pen and it fell on the floor . His gray eyes were furious under his black brows and his lips tightened . " I suppose you mean his father is rich , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , all the sort of things that I have n't ! " " You know I do n't mean that , " Jeremy said . " We 'd better drop it . "  | They had dropped it and he was too proud to tell Jeremy that he did know what he meant . For William was beginning to know that he lacked one grace among his gifts . He could not win love from ordinary people . He excused himself by saying that it was because they felt his superiorities , his obvious mental power , his ability to do easily what others did only by effort . The superior man , he told himself , turning the pages of his Nietzsche , ' must always be hated by his inferiors , but even this hatred could be turned to advantage and used as a tool for further power for good . " I must expect hatred , " William thought . " I must accept it as my due because I am not understood . What the common man can not understand he hates . " ' Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed and he was careful to seem kinder to his friend , more quick to help him , more patient with his frailties , his headaches , his manners . William , relentlessly remembering his defeat , was further disturbed by an editorial in the Crimson before the class elections . Roosevelt wrote : " There is a higher duty than to vote for one 's personal friends , and that is to secure for the whole class leaders who really deserve the positions . " These were the words of a man determined to be a liberal in spite of class and property . While the Gold Coast repudiated them , votes belonged to the many . William never forgave Franklin Roosevelt . He had already begun to believe that the people anywhere in the world were clods and fools and now he was convinced of their folly . The Boers who fought England were clods and fools . The Chinese he remembered upon the streets of Peking were clods and fools . From now on he spoke to no one at Harvard except those who lived on the Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified him again . A pallid professor with long mustaches said these words with an emphasis too fervent for William 's taste : " The American people control their own destiny . " William began then in earnest the study of the history and government of his own country . He perceived to his dismay that the professor 's remark was a true one . Clods and fools though they might be , the American people elected their rulers , laughed at them , despised or admired them , obeyed or disobeyed them , clung to them or rejected them . He began after that to look at the people he passed on the street with consternation and even fear . Out of ignorance apparent  | upon their faces , obvious in their crude speech , these men chose from among themselves certain ones upon whom they bestowed the powers of state . It was monstrous . For months William felt himself in a den of lions . He tried to talk to Jeremy , who first laughed at him and then tried to explain : " Americans are n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such reverence . What he saw beyond the Gold Coast reminded him ominously of the streets and roads of China . He had feared the common people there . Had they not risen up in all their folly against men like his father ? Von Ketteler had been murdered by an ignorant clod . He remembered that dignified German , who at the Fourth of July celebrations at the American Embassy had more than once spoken to him with courtesy . The common people could rise against their betters anywhere and kill them , unless they were taught and controlled . Yet , how to control these boisterous , independent , noisy jokesters who were the common folk of his own country ? They would not tolerate a real ruler . They had no respect for those above them . They delighted to pull down the great and destroy them . Look at Admiral Dewey , a hero for an hour , whose plaster triumphal arch , designed for marble , fell to dust and was carted awry by the garbage collectors ! The whim of the people was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing now his own lack of charm , that strange senseless power to attract his fellows , the charm which young Franklin Roosevelt possessed as easily as he possessed height , fearlessness , and ready laughter . Without this frail gift , William told himself proudly , he must rely upon his brains and devise a means of teaching and controlling the wild beast of the multitudes . He would lead them wisely , insidiously , charming them through words , himself never seen . In that third year in college he wrote to his father to say that he would not come back to China . " I feel 1 am needed more here than there . The truth is , I am not impressed by American civilization . I intend to start some sort of newspaper , something ordinary people will read , or at least look at , and so do what I can to enlighten my fellow countrymen . " Some day , William vowed to his own heart , he would be the editor and owner of a newspaper , perhaps even a chain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disliked or disapproved . To dislike was to disapprove . Money , of course , he must have but he would get it somehow . Quite stupid men were able to get rich .  | Meanwhile , Franklin Roosevelt did not win the Phi Beta Kappa key , and William felt assuaged when he himself was among the chosen . Yet the college years , as they passed , were good ones . He became a member of the Cameron family and spent his vacations with them , after brief duty visits to his grandparents and his sisters . It was accepted now that William was independent and different . Henrietta was proudly silent with him , Ruth worshiped him timidly , and his grandparents tried , somewhat in vain , to treat him as an ordinary young man . They knew he was extraordinary . Even Mrs. Cameron saw that now . It was pleasant to have about her a handsome young man who knew how to dress and was always ready to do what she needed done . He paid little attention to Candace , she reflected after each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her poor son . She introduced William to the ladies at her Christmas At I Tome and forgot to mention that his father was a missionary , leaving the impression that he was connected with the diplomatic corps in Peking . William did not correct her . His dreams hovered about the many happy weeks he spent in the great square house on Fifth Avenue . Each summer he accepted a job that Mr. Cameron offered him . He went to Europe wit Jeremy , a combination secretary and guide , and they shared a valet . Together the two young men wandered about old cities and sailed tl , c Mediterranean . It was a matter of course that William would always go home with Jeremy when the journey was over . IIc. had his own two rooms in the vast Cameron house . They opened into Jeremy 's suite . From there he seldom wrote to or heard from his sisters and his grandparents , and Peking he had nearly forgotten . The Camerons had become his family . He thought about the Camerons a great deal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might reach vague heights he imagined but could not see . Among the many things he discussed with Jeremy this was not one . William was not crude . IIe had lived too long among Chinese , even though only servants . Iie felt crudity in his mother and shrank from it , but he forgave her because of her willingness to sacrifice . His mother was " for " him , as he put it , and when he discovered this quality in any person , he overlooked all else . Nevertheless he was glad that during his college years his mother was remote in Peking . He was still not yet sure that the Camerons were entirely " for " him , not even Jeremy . This uncertainty made him pleasantly diffident and unselfish in his dealings with each of them .  | To Jeremy , he gradually became someone always willing to spare him tiresome stairways when he wanted a book from the library , and so he wore away dislike . To William 's listening silence Jeremy in vacations talked more freely than at college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a spirit confounded by conscience . Thus Jeremy spoke on the solid matter of money . " I know that if my father had not been rich I would now have been dead . But I wish I could owe my life to something else . " " Perhaps you might say that you owe it to your father 's being so able as to get rich , " William had suggested . " I do n't know that merely being able to get rich is anything particularly noble , " Jeremy had replied . " Not everyone can do it , nevertheless , " William said . " Your father must have had some natural gift . " A look of aversion came upon Jeremy 's pale and too mobile face . " The gift is only that of being able to overcome someone less strong in the competitive game . " To this William put up silence , and into the silence Jeremy continued to talk . " Sons of rich men always complain of their father 's riches , I suppose . Yet there ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death . " Still William made no answer . Jeremy had come to no grips with life . The trouble with Jeremy was that he wanted nothing . He himself wanted everything ; success with the newspaper he meant to have , and after that a wife beautiful and wealthy , a mansion to live in , a place in the world where he could be unique in some fashion he did not yet know , and the means to all this , he perceived , was money . He was perfectly sure that money was what he wanted first of all . In his quiet way he reflected further upon the Cameron family . His brotherly relation to Jeremy he could easily develop . Quite honestly , he liked Jeremy . Candace he would consider as time passed . He was too nearly an intellectual to be in haste for marriage . Mrs. Cameron he understood and did not fear . His thoughts , flying like tentative gray hawks , now lit warily near the image of Mr. Cameron . This man was the central figure , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real finesse . Mr. Cameron knew secrets . Pondering upon that vague and unimpressive person , William perceived that behind the nondescript face , the long and narrow mouth , there was something immense , a power strong and profoundly restrained . He guessed by some intuition of like mind that Mr. Cameron never told his true thoughts to his family , certainly at least not to women ,  | and probably not to his delicate and oversensitive son . Into that loneliness William determined to go , not with deceit but with honesty . " Mr. Cameron , " he said on Easter Sunday , " I would like to ask your advice about something . " " Why not ? " Mr. Cameron replied . Sunday was a day on which he drowsed . It was now afternoon , however , and late enough for him to have recovered from the immensities of dinner . He had slept , had waked , had walked in the garden with his wife and daughter to see the promise of some thousands of daffodils , and had come in again to reread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , which was his favorite resting place . There William had come , after waiting patiently in his own room , from which he could see the prowling among the daffodils . Jeremy and Candace had gone with their mother to see their grandparents . He sat down at a respectful distance from Mr. Cameron and upon a straight-back chair . His childhood in Peking had taught him deference to elders , and he would not have been comfortable had he chosen one of the deep chairs upholstered in brown leather . " I would like to talk about my future , sir , " he said . " What about it ? " Mr. Cameron asked . His eyes roved to the newspaper at his feet . The financial section was uppermost and he was disgusted to see that the profits of a rival company had risen slightly above those of his own . " I want to get rich , " William said simply . Mr. Cameron 's gray eyebrows , bunched above his eyes , quivered like antennae . " What do you want to get rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something more than his usual careless interest . " I see that here in America a man can not get any of the things he wants unless he is rich , " William replied . Mr. Cameron smiled and agreed suddenly . " You 're damn right ! " i le kicked the newspaper from his feet , sat back , and felt in his pocket for a cigar . It was a short thick one , and he lit it . and puffed out a cloud of blue and fragrant smoke . The vague harrier that stood always between himself and his son 's friends fell away . He felt he could talk to William . He had always wished that he could talk to young men and tell them the things he knew . If an older man had talked to him when he was young he would have got along faster . " I 'll tell you . " He shifted his cigar to the corner of his mouth . " If you want to get rich , William , you 'll have to quit thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to put your mind to it . "  | " Yes , sir . " William sat at attention , his hands folded upon his crossed knees . They were small hands , as Mr. Cameron remembered his wife had said they were , and they were already covered with surprisingly heavy black hair . William 's hair on his head was black , too , in contrast to his light gray-green eyes . An odd-looking boy , Mr. Cameron reflected , though so handsome . " Have you thought of any special line ? " Mr. Cameron asked . William hesitated . " Did you , sir , at my age ? " " Yes , I did , " Mr. Cameron replied . " That 's the trick of it . You have to think of something that people want  --  not a few rich people , mind you , but all the ones who do n't have much money . You have to think of something that they must buy and yet that wo n't cost too much . That 's how I thought of the Stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William knew the Cameron Stores very well . There was one in almost every city . He had wandered about them more than once , looking at the piles of cheap underwear and kitchen utensils and groceries and dishes and baby carriages and linoleum , everything that an ordinary family might want and nothing that Mrs. Cameron would have had in her own house . It was repellent stuff . " I 've thought of a newspaper , " William said . Mr. Cameron looked blank . " What about a newspaper ? " " A cheap newspaper , " William said distinctly . " With lots of pictures so that people will first look and then read . " " I never thought of such a thing , " Mr. Cameron said . He stared at William , digesting the new and remarkable idea . " There are already plenty of newspapers . " " Not the kind I mean , " William said . " What kind do you mean ? " Mr. Cameron asked . " I thought I knew about every kind there was . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What I am thinking of , though , is new for America . I got the idea from England  --  and a little bit , perhaps , from the New York World , and then the Journal . But I did n't think of doing anything myself until I began to hear about Alfred Harmsworth in England . Ilavc you seen his papers , sir ? " " No , " Mr. Cameron said . " When I 'm in London I always read the Times  --  maybe look at the Illustrated Times on the side . " " My paper , " William said , as if it already existed , " is what 's called tabloid size and it is to have everything in it that can interest the masses . It wo n't be for people like you , Mr. Cameron . It will have  | plenty of pictures . I 've noticed even in college that most of the men do n't really read much but they will always look at pictures . " " I hope you do n't mean yellow journalism , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , " William said . " I hope I can do something more subtle than that " He paused and then went on thoughtfully , his eyes on the patterned carpet . " I thought , if you approved , I would talk with Jeremy about it and some day we might go in on it together . " Mr. Cameron was pleased . It might be the very thing for Jeremy , easy work , sitting behind a desk . He had often wondered what to do with his fragile son , but he was too prudent to show approval . " Well , it would depend on what Jeremy wants . Newspapers cost a lot of money to start . " William was calm . " That 's why I want to get rich . " He was too wise to repeat what his mother had often told him , even before he went to Chefoo . His mother had sown in him early the seeds of common sense . " You ca n't have but so many friends , " she had said . " And each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the folly of useless friends in the English school ; his speaking acquaintance there with the British Ambassador 's son had served him more usefully than the horde of missionaries ' children . At college he had selected from among Jeremy 's friends three whom he was transferring to himself , Blayne Parker , Seth James , and Martin Rosvaine . Blayne William still doubted because he was a poet , and Jeremy supplied to him something that William knew was not in himself . Seth and Martin he was resolved to keep . Yet there was no reason why the five of them , Jeremy included , should not stay together after college . Seth 's father alone could , if he would , supply the capital they would need . Meanwhile he was getting into their clubs . " Got it all figured out , eh ? " Mr. Cameron said . A look of admiration came over his face , mingled with reluctance . if Jeremy had been this sort of a fellow , he would have got him into the Stores . Invitation was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He swallowed the words . William would be too smart , maybe , ten years from now when he himself was getting to be an old man . I Ic might not be able to cope with that new young smartness in case it opposed him . It was all right to give young men a chance , but not the whole chance . On the other hand , William might be the making of the Stores , at the time when he needed somebody . If the boy married Candy , for example , it would be almost as good as though he were born into the family . This would take time to think out . He leaned back and crossed  | his hands on the small paunch that hung incongruously on his lean frame . " When the time comes , " he said dreamily , " I might be able to do something myself , William . Only might , that is . I ca n't tell from year to year , government being what it is in this country . " William rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cameron , " he said in a firm and resonant voice . " I 'm sure I can stand on my own feet . " It was entirely the proper answer , although he felt that the time would come when he would need Mr. Cameron . Far better to owe money to Mr. Cameron than to the father of Seth James . Before Mr. Cameron could reply , the door opened and Candace came in looking , her father thought fondly , like the morning star . She was all in rose and silver and wrapped in soft spring furs of white fox . Her cheeks were pink with the wind , for she had insisted on having the carriage windows open , and her yellow hair was curled about her ears and feathered over her forehead . " Why have you two hidden yourselves away here ? " she demanded . " Mother says please come out at once and be public . We have callers . " " We 've been talking business , " Mr. Cameron said . It was his instinctive reply to any demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " William has n't any business . " " He has an interesting idea , " Mr. Cameron said , fitting the tips of his fingers together . " A very interesting idea . " Then he got an idea himself . I Ic rose and made haste with his slow step toward the door . " I 'll go , just to please your mother . William does n't have to be bothered with our friends unless he wants to . I 'll bet it 's the Cordies , anyway . " " It is , " Candace said , with dimples . " Do n't you come , William , " Mr. Cameron said . " They wo n't remember you next time they see you , anyway . " Thus he left these two young members of his society together , and went his way inwardly pleased . Candace could be trusted . She would n't let even her own husband do the family any damage . He was long used to eating his cake and having it too . The secret of such maneuvering had laid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the misfortunes of others . Maybe when the time came he would help William . He had a lot of loose cash he did n't know what to do with . Left alone with Candace , William said nothing and she sat down in the chair where her father had been sitting , threw off her fur jacket , and lifted her small flowered hat from her head . " What have you two been talking about ? " she asked .  | " Your father asked me what I wanted to do after I finished college and I said start a newspaper , " William replied . Her very clear blue eyes were sweetly upon him . " And why a news-paper ? " William shrugged his handsome shoulders . " Why does one do anything except because it is what one wants to do ? " " No , William , do n't run around the corner . Why do you feel so inferior to everybody ? " She had thrust a point into his heart . His blood rushed into his face and he was careful not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " His usually careful voice was dangerously - careless . i " Do n't you ? " she demanded . II " I really do n't know myself . " She refused the responsibility of special knowledge . " Anybody can see that you never come straight out with answers . You always think what to say . " " I suppose that is because I have never lived much in America , " he replied . Though he despised his China , he often found it convenient to take refuge there . It gave him a reason , faintly romantic , for his difference from ordinary people . " You mean the Chinese do n't answer honestly ? " she asked . " I think they prefer to answer correctly , " he said . " But honesty is always right . " " Is it ? " he asked with wisdom gentle and superior . " Is n't it ? " " I do n't know , " he said again . " But you must think , " she cried with soft impatience . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 1 guess my way a good deal of the time . I meet people every day whom I can not understand . I have no experience that would help me . " She considered this for a brief instant . " Arc the Chinese so different from us or are you only pretending ? " " Pretending what ? " " That you are different . " " I hope I am not too different from you , Candy . " This was a bold step and she retreated . " I do n't know if you are or not . I ca n't make you out , William . " He felt he had gone far enough . " Nor I you , sometimes , except today you look lovely . We do n't have to make each other out as you call it  --  not yet , anyway . Let 's not hurry , eh , Candy ? I want you to  | know me , as I really think I do n't know myself . That means time , plenty of time . " He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet rejected . She fended him off . " Why do you keep talking about time ? " He laughed silently . " Because I do n't want someone else to come dashing up on a steed of some sort and carry you off ! " This was very plain indeed , and she dropped her eyes to the pink rose she had fastened upon her white fur muff , and considered . When she spoke it was with mild malice upon her tongue . " Yet I am sure that you always reach out to take what you want ? as soon as you are sure you want it . " William met this with astuteness . " Ah , but you see , this time you might not want what I want . And I confess to being Chinese again to this extent : I do n't like to be refused , even indirectly . I prefer not to be put in that position . " " That 's your sense of inferiority again . " " Call it just being sensible . " " A bad sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not sport . " He spoke with such quiet authority that her youth was compelled to respect his . He was only a year older than she , and yet he might have been ten years her senior . " I do n't know what we are talking about , " she said wilfully . " You and me , " he said gravely , " though two , or three years , perhaps , from now . " " I sha n't want to marry anybody for a long time yet , " she said . " That is all I wanted to know , " he replied . He had been leaning against the marble mantelpiece , his hands in his pockets . Now he went over to her and lifted her hand and put it to his lips . She would have pulled it away but he did not give her time . In the same instant he put her hand down and left the room . His lips had been cold and dry but his palm was damp . She took her handkerchief and rubbed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat for a long time alone and thoughtful . As the last months of college passed , William was oppressed by fear lest his parents decide to return for his commencement , a fear that he had never acknowledged even to himself until his father had written in April from Peking :  | Neither your mother nor I can be there to see you take your honors , my dear son . This is a real grief to us . We have discussed the matter many times , and at first I was inclined , with her , to use our small savings and ask for leave of absence without salary . Then it seemed to me that I had no right to put personal feelings ahead of God 's work . This is a peculiar age in which we now live in China . The opportunity to preach the gospel is unprecedented . Much as I deplore the manner in which we finally brought the Old Empress to her knees , and especially the looting of the city by Western troops , nevertheless it has taught her a lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mysterious ways and we must not lose the harvest . I only wish the old Dowager Empress could understand that she is defeated . Alas , she can not imagine it . Two weeks later his mother had sent pleasantly heartbroken pages : My darling William , I can not see you in all the pride of graduation from Harvard ! The girls are costing us so much this year . Henrietta 's operation for appendicitis has prevented it . The Board paid for it , of course , as they should do , but when I asked for a brief furlough to see my own only son graduate they refused me , saying that they had already been put to much expense . We can not blame Henrietta , still it does seem strange it should have happened like this . We could use our savings  --  such a mite  --  but I will not do it , for it would give the Board future ideas . They owe us much for just living so far from our homes . Oh my son , do have many pictures taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends who will , for your mother 's sake , make the day visible to mc . I ) o beg dear Jeremy , or Mr. Cameron . Tell them how my heart aches not to be with you and them . William had written a suitably sad letter and then , his spirit freed from the possibility of the presence of his preposterous parents , he had set himself to finish his senior year with glory . One evening in June he was dressing himself for a dance . It was a few days before commencement and Martin Rosvaine 's family in Boston was giving him the occasion . The Rosvaincs were old Bostonians , proper except that their ancestry was French instead of English . Wealth mended this defect and Gallic gaiety lingered in their blood and made them enjoy pleasures more lavish than could be found usually among other Bostonians . William was as near complete happiness on this evening as his unfulfilled ambitions allowed . Candace it  | was among the young women invited and she and her parents were staying at the Hotel Somerset until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her soft and pretty face , and he wondered , if he would tell her that his name stood among those few who would receive their diplomas summa cum laude . He decided that he would not , because Jeremy had barely passed , in spite of William 's unflagging help with higher mathematics and modern languages . Candace was quick to be scornful of boasting and he could not explain to her that the English schoolmasters had grounded him well and had taught him to dig into fundamentals . Jeremy , persuaded by tutors through a delicate childhood , had not known that mathematics must be seized as one seizes a thistle , that German can not be learned unless it is grappled with and overcome by force , that French can elude mind and tongue with its smoothness and escape memory entirely . Because an English schoolmaster in a Chinese seaport had used a ruler freely upon William 's balms , had cracked him over the skull , had tweaked his ears , had poured out the bitterest and most dry sarcasm about upstart Americans who were properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve even his small ambitions . Somewhere in dark and private action there had to be struggle and mastery . Never having had the advantage of such knowledge , Jeremy had been content to escape failure . Ile was now lying in bed , dressed in lavender silk pajamas becoming to his fair hair and pale skin . He had declared himself exhausted by watching the baseball game in the afternoon . Idly he watched William shave clean his strong dark beard with an old-fashioned razor . June sunshine poured through the windows and William stood with his feet iii a bright square . His mind was busy with plans that had nothing to do with college . After commencement was over he would take two weeks ' holiday with the Camerons , and then he would plunge into the matter of getting money for the newspaper . His first plans for getting money he had given up altogether . He could not beg money from his college mates and their relatives . He would find it himself , get it , if possible , from Roger Cameron , borrow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire Martin Rosvaine and Seth James . But he would do most of the work himself . " You 're thinking about the paper , " Jeremy said suddenly . " So I am , " William replied . He was putting on his tie , his small fingers expert and supple . " How did you know ? "  | " I know that godalmighty look on your face , " Jeremy replied lazily . " I fear and respect it . " " I 'm no son of a millionaire , " William said with a mirthless smile . " I have to get out and hustle , the way your old man did . Maybe my son will be able to lie around and write poetry . " " I ca n't imagine your son doing such a thing , " Jeremy retorted . He fell silent at this mention of William 's son , for inevitably a son must have a mother , and he knew by now that William wanted to marry Candace . He was in the puzzling place of being the confidant of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betray to either what the other told him . Each was equally unsure . William had said frankly , only a few days ago , " I do n't know if I am doing wisely in letting myself fall in love with Candy . I like her being your sister , I like the notion of being your brother-in-law , you son-of-a-gun ! But she 's used to everything , and I shall have a hard row to hoc . I sha n't want her running home to papa , either . When I marry 1 ' 11 be the boss . If I have to eat cornpone , she 'll have to eat it and like it . " William had looked particularly handsome at the moment when he had so spoken . They had come back to their rooms from a stag dinner at their club , and he was wearing new evening clothes presented somehow by his mother . He had gone down to New York to have them fitted . Jeremy had laughed . " I 'll guarantee you wo n't eat cornpone twice yourself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastidious and expensive , shaped , Jeremy always said , by his early years of feeding upon shark 's fins ' and bird's-nest soup in Peking . When Candace had last mused upon marriage in his presence he had warned her that William was hardhearted . " He has to be the master , " he had told Candace . " Has he been that with you ? " she demanded . " No , because he has not got all he wants from me yet . " " What does he want ? " " He wants power more than anything , " Jeremy said thoughtfully . " That 's because he feels inferior , " Candace said at once . " He is afraid , in his heart . That 's so pitiful , Jeremy . He does n't know that he need n't be afraid of anything or anybody , because actually he 's wonderful . He does n't know how wonderful he is . " Jeremy grinned in brotherly fashion . " Doubtless he 'd like to have you tell him so . But I warn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , once he 's got you . " Then , after an instant 's silence , " It makes my flesh crawl . "  | This startled her . " Why ? " she demanded . He shook his head . " There 's no love in him anywhere , for anybody . " " Maybe he 's had nobody to love , " she said simply . Fragments of such conversations came back to him as he lay watching William dress . " You 're going to be late , " William said , throwing him a sharp look . His light eyes under the dark and heavy brows had a strange metallic quality . " My family is used to me . They 'll wait . Maybe we 'll do the waiting . I wish my father had bought an Apperson instead of a Maxwell . " " The Maxwell is bigger , " William said . Mr. Cameron had surprised them all by buying an automobile after Easter , and had chosen the Maxwell for touring . It ran by steam , an idea already old-fashioned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A gooselike honking rose through the open window , followed by a hissing of steam . Jeremy leaped out of bed , put his head out of the window and shouted to the chauffeur , " Cool her off , Jackson ! " He disappeared into the bathroom , snatching towels as he went , soft silky towels embroidered in Ireland with a large and intricate initial . Left alone , William thought of Candace while he finished his toilet . His fingernails perfected , his coat adjusted , his tie correct , his hair smooth , he examined himself in the mirror . The dark oval of his face did not displease him , although he did not like the faint resemblance he saw there to Henrietta . He looked at his watch . It was later than he had thought and he wondered if the florist had delivered the pink rosebuds and blue forgetme-nots he had ordered for Candace . His thoughts played pleasantly about her for a moment . He had made up his mind to marry her , and thinking of it he felt a hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask her tonight ? A warm , fine night , the romantic setting of an opulent house , his own sense of success to be crowned soon with summa cum laude  --  what else did he lack ? He was not impulsive , emotion had waxed slowly to this moment , and he would complete this first era of his history by settling the matter of his marriage . He was so silent and even solemn that Jeremy watched him thoughtfully while dressing . In the car they were compelled to silence , muffled in caps and dusters , while Jackson speeded at more than ten miles an hour across the darkening countryside . There was a rising wind , and when in Boston the door of the huge house opened to them , sustained  | by a footman , both young men went at once to a dressing room to wash the gray dust from their faces . William was separated from Jeremy immediately by Martin , come to find him . " William  --  I say ! " Martin cried in a low voice of excitement . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper ! " He had pulled William into a corner under the vast oaken darkness of the stairs . " I ca n't ask people for money , " William muttered . " Do n't be silly , " Martin said . He took William by the elbow and pushed toward the ballroom , where an old lady in black lace and diamonds sat in a high-backed chair against some palms . " Auntie , this is William Lane , " Martin said . William bowed . " So you 're the young man , " Aunt Rosamond said in a loud voice . " Come from China , my grandson tells me . It 's an awful country , from all I hear , tying up women 's feet and killing missionaries ! " " I hope that is over , Miss . Rosvaine , " William said gracefully . " Do n't talk about China , Auntie , " Martin said impatiently . " Talk about our newspaper ! " Over the plumed white head , Martin 's eye met William 's and winked . " Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely read ? " William asked . " Aunt Rosamond is a shrewd woman , " Martin replied . " Are n't you , Auntie ? Why , she tells her own investment men what to buy and what to sell . " Aunt Rosamond giggled . " I 'm old enough to he their mother , " she said in her harsh , loud voice . " I 'm old enough to be anybody 's mother . I could be your great-grandmother , only I 'm glad I 'm not . Young men are so ribald these days . Is your newspaper goin ' to make money ? " " Piles of it , " William said . " That 's why we 're starting it . " " I hope it 's not for any nonsense of doin ' good to the masses , " Aunt Rosamond said still more loudly . " Only good to ourselves , " William said . " I want to be a millionaire before I am thirty . " He knew now that the only way to interest the rich was to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aunt Rosamond commanded with quick interest . She turned large black eyes to his face , and he saw with surprise that once she must have been beautiful . " Thank you , " William said . He turned to Jeremy . " There is Candace . Do excuse me , Miss Rosvaine . " He bowed and left them  | because he did not want to seem eager before a rich old woman , and he saw in Martin 's face the unwilling admiration which he loved . Walking across the carpeted floor he stopped to shake hands with Mrs. Rosvaine , a gray-haired , handsome woman in a silver gown , and then with Mr. Rosvaine , who looked like the portrait of his French great-grandfather hanging over the mantelpiece . Then he went to the Camerons and , pretending that he saw Candace last , he shook hands with the two elders before he turned to her . She wore a long filmy white dress and carried the roses and forget-me-nots . She looked as a beautiful girl should look and as he wanted his wife to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature rolled up out of his heart . It was intolerable that anyone except himself should possess this precious creature with all her gifts and graces . He might look the world over and not find a woman so suited to him , who was at the same time attainable . " You look like a princess , " he told ( ; andace . " William , do n't tell me you 're poetic . " She gave him her careless and pretty smile . " No , just that I 'm partial to princesses , " he protested . " I grew up in the neighborhood of a palace , in Peking , you know , where princesses lived and played . They 're not strange to mc . " Mrs. Cameron overheard and said a little sharply , " Are your sisters coming to commencement , William ? " Taken aback he , too , spoke more sharply than he knew . " They 're coming tomorrow . " " You 're a silent sort of an ape , " Jeremy put in . " Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think you 'd be interested , " William retorted . " Of course I am , " Jeremy insisted . " You know my sister and am I not to know yours ? " " Henrietta is quite ugly , " William said with apparent frankness . " And though Ruth is pretty , I have never discovered anything interesting about her . " " Men never see anything in their sisters , " Candace declared . Their interest in any conversation not connected with themselves waned quickly . In the fashion of the rich , William thought . " It is going to be hot , " Mrs. Cameron said in a plaintive voice . " You ca n't possibly be as hot in that outfit as I am in mine , " Mr. Cameron told her . " I do n't know , " she said . " I have to wear a cor ? " " Mother , spare us ! " Candace put in.  | " I do n't mind William , " Mrs. Cameron said . " He 's used to us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come and sit down . I hope you 've made Candace keep the first dance for me . She promised it but she never keeps her promises . " " She 's a very naughty girl , " Mrs. Cameron said with vague indulgence , sitting down . " I did keep it , " Candace said . " And I do n't break my promises . " The orchestra began to play and the ballroom seemed suddenly full . William made a smile serve for answer and drew Candace into his arms . He danced beautifully and he was aware of watching eyes . He imagined them thinking of him with admiration , however reluctant . He liked to compel admiration . Then he looked down and-saw Candace 's face , calm and beautiful . Her skin was fine and smooth and creamy white , her lips sweet and deeply cut . How fortunate for him if she would marry him soon ! Why should they be long engaged ? He needed Candace now , for herself and for everything she could bring to him . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him . It was a man 's own business whom he married and when he married . In such dreams , compounded of the many mixtures in himself , he went through the evening , evading Jeremy , dancing with Candace again and again , and when she was not free he asked no one else . Then to his horror he saw her ( lancing twice with Seth James . Pangs seized him . Seth was one of her kind , the son of a man richer even than her father . He went to Candace to claim his own last dance . " I ca n't let Seth look at you like that , " he said sternly , as he took her in his arms . She smiled dreamily without answer and he saw her shoulders shining white and her hair gold in the light of the lamps . 1 lc imagined that she was withdrawn from him and instantly he wanted to force her attention to himself . " I wo n't tell you how beautiful you are , " he said half carelessly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " she murmured . He imagined that she was holding herself away from him and he drew her closer . " You are not in rhythm . " " They 're playing the waltz too slowly , " she replied , but she yielded herself , her cheek all but touching his shoulder . Still he was not satisfied . He stopped and they stood motionless in the whirling crowd . " Come along outside , " he said abruptly . " I 've been full of something all evening  --  something I 've wanted to say . "  | He put her hand in his arm and led her away , looking strangely grim for a young man in love . Jeremy , across the room , watched them go through an open door and since for the moment he was not dancing , he went to find his parents . They were waltzing quietly together in a distant corner and they stopped as he came up . " I just want to warn you , " he said in a low voice . " At this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh dear ! " his mother exclaimed . His father looked grave . " I do n't know that we can do a thing about it , " he said after an instant 's thought . Before Jeremy 's astonished eyes the two looked at each other and resumed again the slow measures of their waltz . He left them after another moment and then went to pour himself a large glass of whisky and drink it down . Outside the house , under a wisteria bower in the garden lit by Chinese lanterns , William began his proposal to Candace . He had wondered often how this should be done , and had made some half-dozen plans , none of which he now used . She looked so cool , so full of sweet common sense , that he felt it wisdom to approach her in like mood . " Candy , I think you have known for a long time that I want to marry you , if you will have me . " These were the words he spoke almost as soon as she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile had given her the fan last Christmas , a thing of silk and sandalwood which his mother had chosen for him in Peking . He smelled the sandalwood now in the warm air of the night , and childish memories stirred , sandalwood and incense and the close sweet smell of o1 ( 1 temples in the hills where the American missionary families had sometimes picnicked in the long , bright northern summers . He turned away from such useless remembrance . Candace had not replied . " Well ? " he asked a little too sharply . " I did n't think you would ask me quite yet , " she said . He was not able to tell from the pure cool tones whether she was glad or sorry . " I did n't know , either , " he replied in the manner with which he had chosen to present himself to her . " Perhaps I ought to wait until I have some sort of income . But the last few days I 've asked myself why I should wait . I 'd rather like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palace and filled it with slaves that I proposed to you when I was penniless and that you accepted me so . "  | She laughed . " A nice idea ! " She waved the fan and once more the scent came blowing against his face . He moved from it half impatiently . " Then will you , Candy ? " " Will I what ? " " Oh , Candy , do n't tease ! " " But you have n't said you love me ! " " Of course I love you . " It was the first time he had ever spoken the words to any creature and they sat upon his tongue like pebbles . " How strangely you say that ! " she said shrewdly . " Because it is strange to me . I 've never said it before to anybody . " This touched her , he could see . She looked at him curiously , her lashes lifted and long . He had the usual amount of passion in him , he supposed , though he had never tried himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about visiting strange places , the young men whom William had cultivated were not often physically gross . Lustfulness was not one of his own natural sins . Yet slowly he felt rise in him a strong desire to touch this beautiful girl and , guided by instinct , he put out his arms and felt her come into them . Beneath and against his cheek he felt her hair . " Dearest ! " The word rose to his lips of its own accord . He had heard his father use it once or twice to his mother . They had not often been affectionate before others , and the word had clung in his mind . " Will you be good to me , William ? " " Yes , I will . I swear it . " He heard her sigh , he felt her lean against him and the fan dropped to the ground . It seemed to him suddenly that he loved her with all the love he ought to have . Over the grass , in moonlight and lantern light mingled , a quickened waltz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's go back and dance ! " " But are we engaged , Candy ? " he urged . She stood up but he would not let her go , his arms about her waist . He wanted to be sure she was his before she went back into the rooms crowded with young men . " I  --  I suppose so , " she said , half unwillingly , half shyly . " We are ! " He stood up and seized her again and kissed her long and hard . When he released her she gave a little cry . " Ah , you 've broken my fan ! "  | He had indeed . When he picked up the fan it lay in his hand like a broken flower . He had crushed the filigree with his heel , and the scent was strong in his nostrils . " Never mind , I 'll send to Peking for another , ivory instead of sandalwood , and set with kingfishers ' feathers instead of silk . " " Ivory has no scent , " she complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sha n't ever like a fan so well again . " He gave them to her , half resentfully , and they walked into the house and began to dance together in silence . He was angry with himself and then with her . The moment that he had wanted to be perfect had ended badly . He had been awkward , perhaps , but she had been unforgiving . Nevertheless he had proposed and had been accepted . They went on dancing . On commencement day William rose and breakfasted before Jeremy woke , and from the dining hall he went out and across the Yard to the big elm under which he had agreed to meet his sisters and grandparents . They had reached town early , had taken a hack to a , small second-class hotel and there had breakfasted . He saw them waiting for him now , and for a moment they were as detached , as isolated , as a photograph in a family album . Henrietta was plainer than ever and his grandparents were more middle class than he had thought possible . Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden renewal of affection for her . He need not be ashamed of her . But no distaste showed on his resolute young face . He smiled and shook hands properly with his elders . " How are you , Grandfather ? ( I andinotlier , it 's awfully good of you , really  --  I hope the trip was n't hard . " I is kissed Henrietta 's cheek and squeezed Ruth 's slender shoulders in his arms . " Come along . We 'll get good seats . " The Yard was coming to life . Seniors in cap and gown were hastening here and there . He led his guests into the wide-open doors of the hall where a few people were already gathering , and he took pains to find seats where they could see him receive his honors . " Ruth shall sit on the aisle , so she can see me when we come marching in , " he said , and caught her smile . Henrietta had said nothing since they met . She wore a plain dark blue linen suit and a stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were brown like their father 's , but they were deep set and intense , while his were shallowly set and pleasant . This William  | saw but he did not notice her silence . He was in haste to be off on his own business , to leave them . " Let 's meet again under the elm after this is over . " He met their solemn , dazed eyes , tried to smile , and hurried away . His rooms were empty . Jeremy was gone . He snatched his cap and gown and put them on , glanced at himself in the mirror , and joined the thickening crowd . He felt them looking at him as he strode toward the Yard but he pretended he did not . Confidence , excitement , the assurance of success , were hid behind his set and handsome face . The honor the day would bring him was only the first step to all that lay ahead , and he knew it . He took his place among his classmates , and the important day began , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then suddenly he lost it as he was to lose so many days from his life . Everything became unreal to him . His mind seemed to leave his body . It raced ahead into the years , planning , fighting , conquering , gaining all that he wanted . When would he have enough ? When would he know and what would be satisfaction ? I lc tried to bring himself back to this hour , which now that he had it seemed no more an end but only a beginning . He even felt vaguely that he was losing it and he wanted to keep it . It was a part of satisfaction , the first step at least toward fulfillment , a fragment of his life completed . I le tried to think of Candace as he sat among his fellows ; he tried to value the sound of his name upon the list of honor men . " William Lane , summa cum laude ? " But he had ceased already to value what he had , so immense was his desire for what was yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went at once to his grandparents and his sisters . They were waiting for him under the big elm , and his grandmother murmured affection as he came to them . " Your mother will be so proud . " Her eyes misted with the easy tears of the old . " My father got the same honors , " William said modestly . " It was harder in his day , I daresay . He took much more Greek than I did . " Ruth held out a small package , and he took it with affected surprise . " A chain for your watch , " she murmured . " it 's nothing much . " " I brought you a book , " Henrietta said , producing a package . " I wrapped it in red because it 's what they do in China . " " And Grandma and I just have a little check , " his grandfather said , giving him an envelope .  | " It is all too much , " William said gracefully . Ruth cried out softly , " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father ! I know Mother was going to try to have a letter here on this very day . " " We 'll go by my rooms on our way to the hotel , " William said . When he looked in his box there was no letter from China . A few bills were there , still to be paid , and one letter addressed in a hand he did not recognize . It was a tight scrawl , crude and yet formed in some curious personal fashion . He saw on the envelope the address of a town in Ohio that he did not know , and above it was the name of Clem Miller . " No letter , " he told his sisters . " None from them , I mean . Here 's a strange one . " He tore open the envelope . Within it was a single sheet of lined paper , upon which was the same cramped , clear handwriting . Dear William , You may not remember mc . Once you told me to stop fighting a Chinese fellow in Peking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a grocery store . Got a fair job . Wish , though , I had a chance at your education . Am fighting my way up though . I got your address from your father . Wrote to some friends of mine named Fong in Peking but had forgot a good deal of my Chinese and wrote English thinking maybe their son , Yusan , would be able to read print . He showed the letter to your father , and I got a letter that way telling me you were finishing college . I have n't had the chance . Your father told me to get in touch , and I am doing so in memory of old days . Yours sincerely , Clem Miller . " Who is it from ? " Ruth asked , as they walked toward the street . William was looking up and down for a hack . The sun was getting hot . " You remember that Faith Mission family in Peking ? " Ruth shook her head . " I ca n't remember very much about Peking . " " I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the letter . " " You may keep it if you like , " William said carelessly . " There is no reason for me to answer it . " He saw a hack , called it , and they climbed in , he taking the small and uncomfortable seat although Ruth offered to sit there . " You are my guests , " he said with his best smile . The day went on , he living each hour of it grimly and correctly .  | He showed his family about the college and his grandmother suggested seeing his rooms . He put this off until Henrietta was suddenly cross . " I think you do n't want us to see them , " she declared . Upon this , with secret anger , he led them to the rooms , dreading the possibility that the Camerons were there . But the rooms were empty , and his grandmother sat down in Jeremy 's easy chair and slipped her shoe from her heel . " I bought new shoes for the big day , " she said in apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He did not reply to this dreadful remark , and was restless until he got them up again . Yet not in time , for at the moment when they reached the door Jeremy came in and William could not refuse introductions . Jeremy , with his usual grace , stood talking to the elders and Ruth joined them . Henrietta waited in her stolid fashion . It lasted but a moment , and he was leading them on again , now toward the gate and the hack . Then they were gone and he felt exhausted and yet he could not show exhaustion , for mcii he did not know stopped to congratulate him on his honors . IIe tried to accept their praise modestly , to seem careless as though honors meant nothing to him , but he imagined that they saw through his pretense , and then he grew brief and proud and he felt hurt and weary . 1 lc was hot and he wanted a bath and a few minutes ' sleep . Half an hour later , stretched on his bed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , when he tried to think of Candace he found himself thinking instead of Aunt Rosamond . It might he very easy indeed to get money from an old lady like that , perhaps a great deal of money . Then after some deep thinking of this sort he felt that he would like honestly to be ashamed of it , but he could not be . He had nothing and no one to help him . There was not one person in his own family who could be anything but a hindrance to him , and the sooner he separated himself from them the better . He toyed with the memory of Aunt Rosamond 's invitation . It meant nothing . He knew by now that the rich could speak pleasant words as easily as they breathed , with as little significance . It was hard to be the friend of rich men and their sons , but it was the only way to get what he needed for his own independence . Some day , when he had all he wanted , he would let them know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOT ROOM in the suburban house , Henrietta was writing a letter to Clem Miller . She was desperately tired and as usual , after she had been with William , melancholy wrapped her about . His first glance at her had been enough to tell her that she was still ugly , still all that she did not want to be . It was a sign of greatness in her which she did not recognize that she loved Ruth tenderly and humbly in spite of William 's preference . Why , she asked herself again tonight , did it matter what William thought ? But she did care and would always care what he thought of her . It had begun in the old days in the mission house in Peking when the amah who had served them all had taught her that girls must always yield to the precious only son of the family . " You , " Liu Amah had said , " you are only a girl . Weelee is a boy . Girls are not so good as boys . Men are more valuable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should have been sleeping but she could not . Her grandparents and Ruth had gone to sleep , or else by now her grandmother would have tapped at her door to inquire why her light was still on . Swept by the bottomless misery of youth , Henrietta had reached out into the night and had thought of Clem . His letter was still in her handbag and she read it through twice , carefully and slowly . Then she began to write . Dear Clem : You do not know me , but I am William Lane 's sister . William is too proud to write to you . Ile has always been a very proud boy and now he is worse than ever , although he is no longer a boy . He considers himself a man . I suppose he is a man since he has finished college . He is very smart . lle was graduated yesterday with highest honors . I am sorry to say I do n't think he will ever write to you . But I think someone should , since you knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing to you . I do n't know anything much about you , and so I will tell you about myself . I am eighteen and next autumn I will go to college , I hope . I am not at all pretty  --  I had better tell you that right away . It is strange , for I look a good deal like William , and he is thought  | to be very handsome . I suppose it is not the way for a girl to look . My sister Ruth is pretty . She paused and realized that she had nothing to say . This was another of her miseries . She felt so much , she was so racked with vague sorrows and longings and infinite loneliness and yet none of this could she put into words to anyone . She and Ruth went to a public school , since all the money had been needed for William , but she had found no special friends there . The girls thought her queer because she had grown up in China . Perhaps she was . She bit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you ever think of Peking ? I do , often . From the window of my room there in the house where my parents live I used to look out upon a sweet little stubby pagoda  --  a dagoba , I think it was called . There were bells on the corners , and when my window was open and I lay in bed I could hear them ringing . Please tell me whether you think of such things . And shall you go back one day ? I would like to but I can not think how to earn my living there , not wanting to be a missionary . Beyond this she could not go and so she signed herself sedately , sincerely his . When the letter was sealed it seemed to her that she must post it at once , even though it was now midnight . The small clock on her mantel gave this severe notice to her but she did not heed it . She put a dress over her nightgown , and with her feet slippered she went silently down the stairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where stood a postbox . At seven o'clock , she knew , the mail was collected and by breakfast time the letter would be on its way to the small Ohio town that seemed as far away as Peking . She heard the envelope rustle softly behind the shutter , and then she went back home and to her room again . Now she could go to bed . She had put forth a hand into the darkness and perhaps someone would rearli out and clasp it . Comforted by hope she flung herself upon her bed and fell into a sleep that led her back into childhood dreams of a walled compound in Peking , a big shadowy mission house , where soft-footed brown servants came and went , bringing smiles and gentle encouragement to a shy and plain-faced American child . When the letter reached Clem he was in the grocery store . It was the middle of the morning , and Owen Janison , the owner and his employer , came in from his daily trip across the street to the post office .  | Clem 's letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and postmarks . " You got a letter from some place in New York , looks like , " Mr. Janison said . He was a tall thin man , whose mustaches hung down his chin and joined a faded yellow beard . He wore a gray suit and a stiff white shirt with a celluloid collar . Clem was shirtsleeved behind the meat counter . He took the letter and looked at it carefully without opening it . " Thanks , Mr. Janison , " he said . He slapped a piece of corned beef on the scrubbed wooden counter and trimmed off some porous fat . " A pound , did you say , Mrs. Bates ? " he inquired . " Mebbe a pound and a half , " the customer replied , hesitating . " Mr. Bates is terrible fond of the stuff though I do n't eat it myself , more'n a bite . " Clem did not answer this remark . Int the years since he and Bump , one weary morning , had walked into New Point , Ohio , he had learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real . Mrs. Bates was immediate but not real . Even Mr. Janison , upon whom he and Bump were dependent for their living , was immediate and not real . Real was the past and real the future , both equally clear to him alone . To recapture the past he had written to Yusan , Mr. Fong 's son , and he had received the letter from Dr. Lane . Yusan had forgotten his English and had given Clem 's letter to the missionary . From Dr. Lane had come a friendly letter , mainly about William and only a little about Yusan . Dr. Lane took it for granted that a youth in America named Clem Miller must be interested in his son William . Reading the faintly stilted lines of the letter , for anything Dr. Lane wrote fell inevitably into the shape of a sermon , Clem had felt all the old realities . Yusan at sixteen was betrothed to a girl in the mission school , though the wedding was still far off . He had grown into a sober young man , over whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian . Real was the memory of Yusan , the stubborn boy , growing into a young man . Real were the hours Clem had spent with him in Mr. Fong 's bare house . Real was the memory of the Peking streets , the wind-driven snows that covered the tiled roofs of house and palace in winter . Real were the fabulous summer skies . Clem . remembered every detail of his childhood , the pleasure of owning sometimes three small cash with which he bought a triangular package of peanuts wrapped in handmade brown paper thick and soft like blotting paper . Real , too , was the joy of a hot sweet potato on a cold morning , bought from a vender 's little earthen oven , and real the pleasure of  | a crimson-hearted watermelon split upon a July day . Real were the caravans of camels padding through the dust , led by a man from Mongolia who knitted a garment as he walked , pulling from the camels the long strands of wool which they shed when the winter was ended . Real were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling actors and the magicians and all that had made the city streets a pleasure place for a wandering foreign child . Out of the need to bring nearer to him that reality of childhood in the remote land which was still his own but which he could not claim and which did not claim him , Clem had upon an impulse written to William , whom he remembered only as he had looked that clay when a Chinese lad had called his father a beggar because he trusted God for bread . The letter Mr. Janison now brought him was , he supposed , from William . He waited , however , until it was time for his midday meal , which he made by taking a roll of stale bread and cutting off a slice of cheese and eating in the storeroom . Mr. Janison went home to noonday dinner and Bump was working on a farm , now that school was over . Clem had been firm about Bump 's going to school . Ile had given up the hope that some day he himself would go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like geography and arithmetic , which he could get for himself out of books in his room at night . He wanted to learn large important matters , such as how to feed millions of people . He was obsessed with the business of food , although his own appetite was frugal . A thin , middlle-sired boy , he had grown into the same kind of young man . His frame had taken on bony squareness of shoulder , leanness at the hips , without any flesh . Even the square angles of his face remained fleshless and his cheeks were hollow and his blue eyes deep set . He had discarded the faith of his father , and said no prayers except those he spoke to his own soul . There were , he believed , only a few essentials to a good life , but they were essential to all people , and food he put first , cheap , nourishing food . Bump , for example , could not be filled . He sat sometimes watching Bump eat in the small room they lived in together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , a stew or a hunk of boiled beef and cabbage and plenty of bread and butter . His own slender appetite soon satisfied , he enjoyed Bump 's bottomless hunger . He had provided the food and this was the pleasure he felt . Nobody had given them anything . Ile had worked and bought the food . He bought cheap food for it was good enough . He had no desire for fancy eatables and was stern with Bump about cake and pie .  | If everybody could eat his fill of good plain food , he would tell Bump , then there would n't be any more trouble in the world . He was bringing up Bump himself and by himself , sometimes ruthlessly but on the whole kindly , with the deep paternal instinct with which indeed he viewed the world , though he did not know it . His cure for a drunk coming into the store to beg on a winter 's night for a nickel to buy " a cup of coffee , " was to take a stale loaf and slice off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Eat that and you wo n't want to get drunk for a while , " he said with young authority . In the back room , the store empty during the town 's midday meal , he now sat down on a crate and took the letter from his pocket . Without wasting time on curiosity , he tore the envelope open and was amazed at the first words . He had never had a letter from a girl , nor ever written to one . He had thought little of any girl , being busy at earning his living and rearing Bump . Now a girl had written to him . He read the letter carefully and considered it a sensible one and read it again . She remembered Peking , too , did she ? He felt excited , not because she was a girl but because she , like him , had been born in another world which nobody here knew anything about . He had learned now to live in America , but there would always be the world for him as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Americans . They did not want to know about it . The people here were satisfied not to know about anything except what happened in their own streets . He sat musing until he heard the tinkle of the bell that announced a customer , and then he went back into the grocery store . He would answer the letter , maybe on Sunday when he had sent Bump off to Sunday School . Thus two weeks later , on a Thursday morning , Henrietta received the letter for which she had waited and for which she had gone herself every morning to open the door for the postman . The moment she saw it she took it and thrust it into the bosom of her apron . That day she was cleaning the attic for her grandmother , a musty place , hot under the roof and filled with dead belongings . There she returned to read Clem 's letter . Dear Henrietta , It was a surprise of course but I had rather maybe have a letter from you than from William . I am older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of earning my living . I am an  | orphan and I have an orphan also to support . I do not even know his whole name , Bump he is called but I am sure it is not his name . He says when he was little he was thought bumptious and so people began to call him that . He can not remember any family and so was an Aid child . I do n't know why I tell you about him . Some day I will tell you how I got him . I am a poor letter writer not having much time but I would like you to know that I do remember Peking . It would be nice to talk with you about it as nobody here knows anything about it over there . Who knows , sometime maybe I could come to see you though not until I get Bump educated . I have a great many ideas of what I want to do when that job is done when I can think of myself and my own life . I would enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus began the passage of letters between a small town in Ohio and a suburb of New York . Without seeing each other for two more years , boy and girl wove between them a common web of dreams . So profound was their need to dream that neither spent the time to tell the other the bare facts of their lives ; Henrietta that she had graduated from the big bare public high school almost friendless because the other girls thought her too proud to join their chatter of boys and dances , and Clem that he was grinding out his youth behind a counter in a country store . These things neither considered important . They were both weaving together the fabric of the past to make the fabric of the future . It was years before Henrietta learned all the simple facts of Clem 's life . These were the facts . He had turned back that day to see Bump padding through the dust after him . That night they had slept in a barn , taking care not to rouse the farmer and his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early morning . " Reckon the Aid will chase us ? " Bump asked in the course of the next day . " I do n't think she 'll care what becomes of us , " Clem replied . The sky was bright above their heads . On that clay he began to have his first intimations of his own country . He had walked for endless miles across the Chinese land with an old woman he did not know , linking village to village with his lonely footsteps . Now he walked as many miles with a child who was a stranger to him , across a landscape  | strange to him , too . Here there were few villages and the farmhouses stood separate and solitary . He avoided them unless he needed food , and then he went to knock upon a kitchen door to ask for work . He was stiff with softhearted farm wives who wanted to give them a meal and he demanded that he be allowed to pay for what he got , and he was equally harsh with surly men who declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be , he told them , because they must have food . How many days he walked in that bright autumn he did not count or care . Slowly he learned to love the look of this land , even its uncultivated spaces , its ragged roadsides , its sparsely settled miles . He learned to be wary of old tramps and to choose the back roads they avoided . In the back roads and the remote farmhouses the people he found were good . They were not gregarious , these countrymen of his . They did not live in big families as the Chinese did . Two generations in a house were enough and maybe too much . More often a man and a woman and their children were alone under a roof . The children were usually towheaded and their faces were burned brown with the wind and sun , and because he was a stranger they ran when they saw him just as the Chinese children had done . He thought of these dwellers on the land as folk half wild and scarcely civilized and yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle down somcwheres ? " Bump asked , as the days went on . " Some time soon . You have to get to school , " Clem said . " Do I have to go to school ? " Bump wailed . " Surely you do , " Clem said sternly . One day at last they came into a town he liked , though it looked no different from any other . But it was in Ohio , a state that he had come to enjoy in the past days , a place where the people were decent and Bible reading . They made him think of his own Bible-reading parents , mingling kindness with rigid goodness . The streets in the town were clean and there was a schoolhouse of wood frame painted white . The church , the post office , and the general store stood around a green square , in the midst of which was a rough statue of Abraham Lincoln . These were the reasons Clem chose New Point , and he went first to the store . Inside he found the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then let him rent a room upstairs as part of his weekly wage . Clem bought Bump a suit of clothes and a pair of shoes and two pairs of socks on credit , and started him to school the next Monday .  | At the end of that Monday he had given Bump his first and only whipping . The boy had come back from school gloomy and had gone upstairs quietly . Clem was busy with a customer and as soon as he was free he hastened up the stairs behind the store . There he found the boy packing his clothes into a flour sack . " What are you doing ? " Clem demanded . Bump scowled at him from under sunburned brows . " I ai n't stayin ' with you , " he said in a flat voice . " Why not ? " Clem asked . " I ai n't goin ' to no school . " Clem glared at the boy who had become his whole family . " Why not ? " he asked again . " I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like to go to school , not to take the chance that was offered , not to accept the gift of sacrifice , seemed to him ingratitude so immense that earth- could not hold it nor heaven allow it . He rushed at Bump and seized him by the scat of his trousers and swung him clear of the floor . He flung him down flat and knelt beside him and beat him with his open hands until the boy howled . Upon this scene Mr. Janison hastened up the stairs . " Lay off ! " he bellowed . " You want to kill that boy ? " Clem turned upon him a face set and white . " 1 ie 's going to take his chance if I do have to kill him , " he replied and finished his punishment . When he let Bump get up he pointed at the flour sack and waited until the weeping boy had unpacked it and put his clothes away again . Janison waited , too , a quizzical look behind his mustaches . Then Clem turned solemnly to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my own brother . That means he 's going to get a good education , the kind I 'd give my eyes to have , nearly . He 's to be a man , not some worthless son-of-a-gun . " Mr. Janison pulled his goatee . " Go to it , " he said . " That was as pretty a lickin ' as ever I see . " He went downstairs again and Clem sat clown on the bed . " Bump , I hope never to lick you again , " he said gravely . " I do n't believe in it and I do n't feel I ought to have to do it . But if you dare to run away and throw out a fine chance like I 'm offering you , I will come after you ' and lick you wherever you are . You hear me ? " " Ye-es , " Bump sobbed . " Well , then , " Clem did not know how to go on . " You come downstairs and I 'll get you some crackers and cheese  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food , he thought , was what the boy needed , and something sweet , maybe . During the next years , as Bump began to grow into a satisfactory boy , Clem wondered often about his beginnings . That he was a child without parents , Clem knew ; without parents , that is , except in the simplest animal sense . Mom Berger had told him one night after the younger children were in bed , that they were all love children , " except that there Bump . " " What is he ? " Clem had asked . " I du n no what you 'd call him , " she had said mysteriously . With an embarrassment which sat ridiculously upon her thick person , she had pursed her lips and remained silent . Pop Berger had taken up the sordid story . " That there Bump , " he said after some moments of rumination and chewing upon a vast quid of tobacco . " He 's what you might call a rape child . " Clem had flushed . " You mean ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relishing the evil news . " His paw attackted a girl on the streets of I'l , illy . ' T was all in the papers . " " Yeah , " Mom Berger said from beside the stove . " And I ast you was it real rape . A woman do n't rape easy or if she do , it ai n't rape . " Pop took the story away from her again . " Anyways , it was brought up in court for to be rape , and the raper , that was Bump 's paw , mind you , he had to pay the girl a hunnerd dollars . " " Some women makes their livin ' one way and some another , " Mom Berger had said , and had clattered a stove lid to let Pop know that enough was enough . If the story was true , Clem had told himself in reflecting pity , then Bump had no parents at all , neither fat her nor mother . By the accident of two conflicting bodies he had been conceived , his soul snared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for even an orphan had once possessed parents . The boy 's solitary creation moved all that was fatherly in Clem 's being , and it was most of him . He had not been alone in what he did either for Bump or himself . With the affection so easily found in any small American town , the citizens observed the solitary and ambitious boy . They knew no more about him than that he was an orphan and they took it for granted that Bump was his brother . That he had run away from an eastern state endeared him to them . Mr. Janison soon began to spread news of Clem 's monstrous good qualities . His industry was astounding to the employer . When other young males of the town were crazed with  | spring and the baseball season , Clem continued behind his counter , even staying to sweep the store as usual when the day was over . His belated arrival on the baseball field and the frenzy of those who awaited him only made him more beloved . For all his medium stature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air and send a ball faster than imagination . " A good all-round feller , " New Point decided , " a feller that 'll make his way . " Two persons kept to themselves their thoughts about Clem . Miss Mira Bean , Bump 's teacher to whom Clem had gone after the whipping , knew that Clem was more than New Point discerned . She knew it the first evening he had come to her door , clean and brushed and holding his cap in his hand . " Come in , " she had said with her usual sharp manner to the young . Clem had come into her small two-room flat . " My name is Clem Miller . " " Sit down , " she commanded . The rooms were small and crowded with furniture and books . There was little space to sit , and he took the end of a haircloth sofa . Miss Bean was like any of the middle-aged women he saw upon the streets of New Point , a lean , sand-colored shape , washed and clean , straight-haired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . " I want to talk to you about Bump , " he said . Iie had gone on then to tell why he had felt compelled to whip the boy . " But I ca n't whip him again , " he said . " You , Miss Bean , have got to make him like school well enough so he will want to get an education . " " He 's got to stay in school , whether he likes it or not , " Miss Bean said somewhat harshly . " It 's the law . " Clem had sat looking at her . " I do n't think you ought to take advantage of that , " he said . " The law is on your side , of course . But even the law ca n't make a boy get an education . It can only make him sit so many hours a day where you are . He 's got to like it before he can get educated . " Miss Bean was not a stupid woman and she was struck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called a man . " You 're right about that , " she said after a moment . She had done her best , not only for Bump but also for Clem , lending him books , guiding his reading , letting him talk to her for hours on Sundays . For though Clem made Bump go to Sunday School  | and lectured him about the value of going to church , he himself never went . " Why n't you go , then , if it 's so good ? " Bump grumbled . Clem , polishing Bump 's ragged school shoes , paused to answer this as honestly as he could . " I just ca n't get myself to do it , " he confessed . " What 's more , I ca n't tell you why . Something happened to me once somewhere . " " What was it ? " Bump asked . Clem shook his head . " It would take me too long to tell you . " He never told anyone anything about himself . It would indeed have taken him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he explain his origins ? How could he ever tell anyone in this peaceful town in Ohio that he had once lived in Peking , China , and that he had seen his parents killed ? There were things too endless to tell . Only to Henrietta was he one day to speak , because she knew at least the beginning . The church bell came to his aid . " You run along , " he told Bump briskly . The shoes were polished and he washed his hands in the china bowl . Then he fixed Bump 's tic to exactitude and parted his hair again and brushed it . " Mind you learn the golden text , " he said sternly . The minister at the Baptist Church was the other person in New Point who kept to himself his thoughts about Clem . He stopped sometimes in the store to see the industrious young man and to invite him to come to the house of God . I lc was a red-haired , freckle-faced young minister , fresh of voice and sprightly in manner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did fear him , nevertheless , though the young minister was persuasive and ardent . " Come to worship God with us , my friend , " he said to Clem one day at the meat counter . He had come to buy a pound of beef for stew . Clem fetched out a piece of nameless beef and searched for the knife . " I do n't have much time , Mr. Brown , " he said mildly . " I really need my Sundays . " " It costs more time in the end not to be a Christian , more time in eternity . " Clem smiled and did not answer . He cut the meat and weighed it , and then cut another slice . " Tell Mrs. Brown I 'm putting in a Iittle extra . " This was his usual answer to those whom he refused something . He gave a little extra food . The store , Clem knew as the years passed , was not his final destina-  | tion . He was learning about buying and selling , and he was learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the small town , he began to recover from the shock of the farm and the man and woman who lived upon it . In its way , he sometimes mused , it had been a shock as severe as that he had received when he found his parents murdered on that summer 's day in Peking . He was taut with nervous energy , he never rested , and there were days when he could not eat without nausea . Food he held sacred , yet food could lie heavy in his own belly . He could not drink milk or eat butter because he could not bear the smell of the cow , and he disliked eggs . Meat he ate almost not at all , partly because he had been so little used to it . He forgot himself . Around the matter of food his imagination played and upon it his creative power was focused . Under Miss Bean 's dry guidance , he read economics and came upon Malthus , and lost his temper . The man must have been one of those blind thinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting out and seeing what was really going on in the world . People were starving , yes , but food was rotting because they could not get it . There was plenty of food , there were not too many people , the trouble was that men had not put their minds to the simple matter of organization for distribution . Food must be bought where it was plentiful and cheap and carried to where the people could buy it . When this idea first came into Clem 's mind , its effect upon him was like that of religious conversion . He did not know it yet , but lie was illumined as his father before him had been , not then by the satisfaction of feeding human bodies , but by the excitement of saving men 's souls . Clem had no interest in saving souls , for he had a high and unshakeable faith in the souls of men as he saw them , good enough as God had made them , except when the evils of earth beset them . And these evils , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for from hunger came illness and poverty and all the misery that forced men into desperation and then into senseless quarrels . Their souls were degraded and lost because of the clamoring hunger of their bodies . As simply as his father had left his home and followed God 's call across the sea , so simply now did Clem believe that he could cure the sorrows of men and women and their children . He did not want to leave his own country as his father had done . Here among his own people he would do his work , and if he were proved right , as he knew he would be , then he would spread his plan of salvation to other lands and other peoples and first , of course , to the Chinese . Other people would see his success and follow him . If he  | had money he would not keep it . He would pour it all into spreading the gospel of good food for all mankind . On Sundays when Bump was at Sunday School and the town in its Sabbath quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside beyond Main Street , planned the business of his life . As soon as Bump was through high school he would begin and Bump could help him . Mr. Janison had offered him a partnership in the store in three more years . He would take it . He had to have a center somewhere . He would make New Point the center of a vast marketing network , buying tons of food in regions where harvests were plentiful , and supplying markets wherever there was scarcity . Meanwhile he must prepare himself . He must learn accounting and management as well as marketing . He must learn the geography of the country until he knew it as he knew the palm of his own hand , so that he could see what harvests could be expected from every part of it . A vast scheme , he told himself , and a noble one , and he wanted to tell Henrietta . He clarified his own mind for many weeks afterward , writing to her every week of his developing ideas . " Keep my letters , Henrietta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make copies . Sometime I may want to check with myself and see how well my notions have worked . " Henrietta kept his letters with reverence . She bought a tin box and painted it red and kept it locked and in the back of her closet . The key she wore around her neck , and when she wrote this to Clem he sent her a strange dirty-looking little amulet on a string and told her how he had come by it from an old woman in China . " Put it in the box along with my letters , " he told her . " It might bring us luck . " William 's wedding was in September after his graduation from college . He had not wanted so early a marriage , and he had suggested to Candace that they wait for a year , or even two , until he knew where he was going to find the two hundred thousand dollars he felt was the least possible capital upon which he could hope to start his newspaper . Candace , who could be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of delay . " If it is only money ? " " It is not just money , " William said . " I must make my plans very carefully . You do n't just start a newspaper . You have to have a prospectus and a dummy and you have to get advertising together . " " You could do all those things as well after we were married as before , " she insisted . " I 'm going to talk to Papa . "  | When she said this William was about to forbid her and then he did not . All summer he had worked hard and late in the city and he had worked alone . Through months so hot that one by one Martin Rosvaine and Blayne Perry and Seth James had stolen away to luxurious homes by sea and mountain and lake , William had lived steadily alone in a cheap two-room flat in lower New York , working day and night upon one dummy after another to get exactly the newspaper he wanted . Once a month he allowed himself to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't want to depend upon your father , " he said at last . " Do n't be silly , " Candace replied with easy rudeness . " Papa would do anything for me . " " So would I , " he said , smiling . " Then let me talk to Papa , " she said . " But do n't ask him for money , please , " he replied . " I can find it somewhere . " He was sorely tempted by the old possibility behind her words , for he had felt compelled to delay his marriage while lie searched for money . Grimly handsome and determinedly suave , he lui.l made friends wherever he could among the rich . He was not one of them but he knew how to be . Though through this summer he had stripped himself bare as a coolie , a towel about his loins while he sweated at his desk night after night , there had been other nights when his garments were such that he feared no valet as he sallied forth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not talk easily but his high-held head and his correct courtesy served him well enough instead . Silence had this value , he found , that when he did talk people listened . On this next visit , the last before his marriage , Roger Cameron asked him to come into his private library one night after dinner . William knew the room well for he had been made free of it during college vacations . The books were curious and heterogeneous , and they provided a fair pattern of Mr. Cameron 's self-education . There was a whole shelf on Christian Science and now , in latter years , another on the religions of India . " Sit down , " Mr. Cameron said . " Candace has been talking to me . " " I asked her not to , sir , " William said somewhat sternly . But he sat down . " Yes , well , Candy never obeys anybody , " Mr. Cameron replied mildly . " Now , William , she wants to get married and she tells me you feel you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel only that I should see my way fairly clear before I take on the support of a wife and a house and so on , " William said . " That 's reasonable , " Mr. Cameron said . " Very right and reasonable . I did no more in my young days . Fact is , I had to wait . Mrs. Cameron 's father would n't hear to anything else , no matter how she cried or how I got mad . We waited . Well , thinking about that makes me feel I do n't want my girl to go through the same thing her mother did . How much money do you need , William ? " William looked reluctant . " I do n't know exactly . " " No , I know you do n't , " Mr. Cameron said with mild impatience . " I 'm just asking . " " I think I should see two hundred thousand dollars ahead , " William said . Mr. Cameron pulled his underlip . " You do n't need that all at once . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay my hands on it . " They were silent for a while . The big room was dark with oak paneling and the lights were lost in the beamed ceiling . " Suppose you tell me a little more about this paper , " Roger Cameron said at last . " What makes you want a paper , anyway ? Why do n't you come into the Stores with me ? " " I appreciate that , Mr. Cameron , " William said very properly . " I do , indeed . But I have set my heart on building up an entirely original sort of newspaper . If it is successful , l shall begin a chain . It will sell for two cents , and it will have nior news than two cents ever bought before . " " You 'll have to get a lot of advertising , " Mr. Cameron said . " That 's where the money will be , " William replied . " But it 's not entirely a matter of money . " " If it 's not a matter of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some astonishment . " I want to accomplish more than making money , " William said . He was not afraid to tell Mr. Cameron the truth . His thin erect body , his high head , his small tense hands clasped together were taut with earnestness . " I look at it this way , Mr. Cameron . Most of the world is made up of common people . They are stupid and ignorant . What they learn in school does n't help them to think . They can not think . They have to be told what to think . They do n't know what is right and wrong . They have to be told . " " People do n't like to think , " Mr. Cameron said shrewdly . " I know that , " William said . " Therefore they act without thought or they listen to Socialists and agitators and they act foolishly and  | endanger decent people . I propose to do the thinking , Mr. Cameron . That is why I want a newspaper . " " How do you know people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . He was very much astonished . He did not know himself what to think of this young man with his lichen-gray eyes . " I wo n't say they are my thoughts , Mr. Cameron , " William said . " I shall do exactly what you do in the Stores . You have men whose job it is to find out what sells best and you buy in quantity what you think people want . Actually , you show people what they ought to buy . That is what I shall do . My paper will be full of what people like . There 'll be plenty of stories with pictures about oddities , about murders , about accidents . But there 'll be events that happen in the world , too , that people ought to know about . " " Where are your ideas , coming in ? " Mr. Cameron demanded . " In the way everything is told , " William said . " And not told , " he added . Mr. Cameron shot him a sharp look . " Smart , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're always right . " " I wo n't be always right , " William replied . " But I shall try to be . " It was more than he had told anybody , even his friends . ' I'hcy knew that he was to be the editor for he had always assumed that he would be , but they did not know that he planned to shape every item , every line , decide the news he would not tell as well as what he did . The paper would be a reflection of his mind and the direction that of his own soul . When he had put out his first issue he would take it to big business firms and show it to top men . He 'd say , " Here is your safeguard . Advertise here and help me influence the people toward Us and away from Them . " " You do n't like folks , do you ? " Mr. Cameron said suddenly . William did not know how to answer . Then lie chose the truth . " I have a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeds contempt , " Mr. Cameron said sententiously . " Perhaps , " William said . " You feel the same way , though , Mr. Cameron . " Mr. Cameron was pulling his lower lip again . " In a way , " he admitted . " I knew it as soon as I saw the Stores , " William said . " If you did n't despise people you could n't sell that stuff to them . " " Here=here ? " Mr. Cameron said sheepishly . " I admire you for it , " William said . " But I have a little more idealism than you have . I think the people can be guided to better things . "  | Mr. Cameron looked at him sidewise . " You may be wrong , William . People are awfully mulish . " William did not yield . " They can be influenced toward something or away from it , just as in the Stores . If you should decide that purple was to be the season 's color , you could get people to buy things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cameron said . " It makes no difference to me what they buy . " " I do care , " William said . They did not talk much after that , but after another ten minutes Mr. Cameron got up . " Well , William , whatever your reasons are I 'll say this : I 'll put away a hundred thousand dollars  --  half of what you need  --  and keep it handy , and I want you to go ahead and have the wedding . " William flushed . " Nothing would please me better , Mr. Cameron , " he said . His marriage day dawned as bright as though he had commanded the sun . At that light striking through his open windows he remembered a story his mother used to tell of his childhood . He had waked once at dawn in the old temple where his family was summering upon one of those bare brown mountains outside the city of Peking . The light was pearly above the horizon and he had shouted , leaping out of bed , " Come up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience to his command , the sun sprang above the edge of the earth . He could not have been more than four years old . The sun had come up as suddenly this morning and he lay realizing as much as he could the meaning of this day . Everything was ready and all that he had to do was simply to be the bridegroom that the day demanded . He had no doubt of himself , for he was to be alone . He had struggled for months over the matter of his sisters and his grandparents and then had dismissed his conscience . Both the girls were at college and . his grandfather was not well . The old man was recovering slowly from a stroke and one side of his face was askew . William would not have them at his wedding . When Candace spoke of them he shook his head . " I do n't want them there , " he said . She had looked at him with strange eyes and had said nothing . The bridesmaids were six of Candace 's schoolmates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blayne and Seth were his ushers . He had made everything as he wanted it .  | The door opened and the valet came in , a middle-aged man with a careful English accent . " Shall I draw your bath , sir ? " " If you please . " " Mrs. Cameron thought you might like your breakfast fetched on a tray . " " I would , thanks . " The ceremony was to be at noon and they were sailing for England immediately . Roger Cameron was giving them the trip . He was giving them a house , too . Not a large one , but a pleasant small structure of cream-colored brick near Washington Square . William had not pretended that either luxury was in his power to provide . " Someday I 'll be able to do all these things for Candy , sir , " he had said , gracefully accepting the gifts . " Of course you will , " Roger Cameron had replied . The bath water stopped running and a valet held up a silk robe , his head turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his shoulders . " Bring breakfast in half an hour , " he said with the brusque manner he had learned in his childhood toward servants . The valet disappeared and William went into the bath . I Ie would stay in his room this morning , away from everyone . Tile rehearsal had gone off well yesterday . There was no detail left for anxiety . Candace was supposed to sleep until just before she needed to dress for the ceremony . He did not want to see Jeremy or any of the fellows . He could do with two hours or so of pure leisure . There was a knock at the door and he answered . A footman came in with a small wheeled table on which was set a large tray of covered dishes . In the midst of them was a little silver bowl of roses . " Your breakfast , Mr. Lane , " the man murmured . " Set it there by the window , Barney , " William replied . The man was young and not much older than William himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his eyes were innocent and humble as the eyes of the poor and ignorant should always be . William liked him and had sometimes encouraged him to talk . " ' T is a nice day for it , sir , " Barney now said . He arranged the tray by the window , from which could be seen the trees of the park , their green tinged with coming autumn . " It is , indeed , " William said . He had put on his new dressing gown , an affair of blue and black stripes , effective with his dark hair and stone-gray eyes . He should perhaps have kept it for tomorrow when  | he would be breakfasting with Candace , but he felt that magnificence alone had also its special pleasure . Barney hovered about the table . " Your eggs is turned as you like ' em , sir , and the toast I did myself . " " Thank you . " " Well , sir , " Barney said at last , " my best wishes , I 'm sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon such composure Barney retired . When he had eaten William sat for a while , smoking a cigarette and drinking a second cup of coffee . Two hours were left in which he need do nothing . He did not know how to do nothing . He thought of going to bed , but he could sleep no more . He did not want to think about Candace . There would be plenty of time for that . He could not read . Two hours  --  a valuable space of time ! When would he be alone again ? He got up abruptly and went to the desk at the other end of the room and sat down before it . There for the two hours he worked steadily and in silence until the thump upon his door announced Jeremy . It was time to get ready for his wedding . A perfect wedding , of course , he had expected . Anything less would have surprised and annoyed him . Ills ushers did their work well and Jeremy was only less efficient . 1le seemed strangely thoughtful throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring , so long that Candace looked at him with startled eyes . But the ring was there in Jeremy 's vest pocket and he gave it to William with a veiled , beseeching look . William did not notice the look . He was absorbed in the proper conduct of his own part , and he slipped the ring on Candace 's finger and made his promises . Going down the aisle a few minutes later , his steps measured to the music , he held his head high in his habitual proud fashion . The fashionable church was crowded . He looked at no one , and yet he was aware of every personage there . Beside him Candace walked as proudly as he did , but it was he who set the step . He had begun the stately march of his life . Clem 's engagement to Henrietta took place abruptly and even awkwardly . The first tentative letters that they had exchanged had carried far more than their proper weight of meaning . They were secret communications between two persons completely solitary . Though Henrietta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | comfortable , unfashionable suburb , living with Ruth , their grandparents , and the two elderly housemaids , she knew herself as lonely as though she lived upon a desert isle . Ruth was popular and pretty and might easily have married while very young any of several men , even before she went to college . That she did not ( 10 so , that she postponed marriage by going to college , was because she visited more and more often in William 's home . Vacations soon meant a few hurried days with Henrietta and getting a wardrobe together suitable for the rest of the vacation , even the long summer , with William and Candace . There was no discussion of Henrietta 's going , too . Ruth had learned to live delicately between her brother and sister , conveying to each the impression of apology and greater affection . " I feel guilty , " she told Henrietta . " I go flying off and you stay here and take care of the grandparents . " " It is what I want to do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silky film . " You would like Candace if you let yourself . Everybody does . She 's very easy . " " I dare say I would like Candace but there 's William , " Henrietta replied with her terrible honesty . " He is your brother , " Ruth persisted , though timidly . She was equally afraid of Henrietta and William . " I ca n't help that , " Henrietta replied . " Do n't forget 1 knew him long before you did  --  and much better . We had those two years together at the Chefoo school when you were at home in Peking with Papa and Mama . " Nevertheless , when Ruth was gone , when she had waved to the pretty face under the flowery hat , smiling through the train window , Henrietta knew she was lonely . Like William 's the lines of her face were severe and her frame was angular and tall . Inside she was like him and yet how unlike ! She was so like him that she could see in herself his very faults . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in their spirits there was no likeness . She was possessed with honesty and a depth of simplicity that frightened away all but the brave , and among the young there are few who are brave . Young men feared her and young girls avoided her . There remained Clem , whom she never had seen and who had never seen her . To Clem , in long silent summer evenings , she poured out her feelings almost unrestrained . He answered her letters on Sundays , when he had sent Bump to church . He had no other vacant hour throughout the week . Even on Sundays he had to work on the books for Mr. Janison . She went to a small girls ' college , an inexpensive one , while Ruth  | had decided to go to Vassar . She did not want to be with Ruth for by then even she could see that Ruth had chosen William and the sort of life he wanted . She listened to Ruth 's accounts of that life , repelled and forlorn . Ruth 's flying blond hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape were the means whereby she was welcomed in William 's life . William was living in a beautiful house , neither large nor small , on Fifth Avenue . Candace had furnished it in pink and gray and gold . There was a great room where they gave parties . It had been two rooms but William had ordered the wall between taken down . William worked fearfully hard and his paper was getting to be successful . Everybody was talking about it . " We ought to be proud of him , " Ruth said . Henrietta did not answer this . She sat gazing at Ruth rather stolidly and no one could have known that she was in her heart giving up this younger sister whom she tenderly loved . When Ruth came back from a long summer spent with William , she had been prepared to tell her about Clem . She had planned it in many ways . She might say , " Ruth , I do n't want you to think I 'm in love , but . . . " Or she might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peking ? Well , I know Clem again . " Or she might simply choose one of Clem 's letters , perhaps the one that explained how he wanted to open a chain of markets , right across the country , in which people could buy good food cheaply , or if they had no money , they could simply ask for it free . " People do n't ask unless they must  --  that is , most people , " Clem had written . He had a deep faith in the goodness of people . People did n't like to beg or to be given something for nothing . The human heart was independent . Henrietta was moved by the greatness of Clem 's faith . In her loneliness she wanted desperately to believe that this was true . But when Ruth talked about William , Henrietta could not tell her about Clem . The two names were not to be linked together . Then one day she saw something new in Ruth 's face , a quiver about the soft lips , a shyness in those mild eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly collapsed into tears , her arms around Henrietta 's neck and her body flung across her sister 's lap . " Why , baby , " Henrietta breathed . She had not used the name since they had been little girls playing house , and she had always been the mother and Ruth her child . She put her arms about the small creature now and hugged her , and felt how strangely long it was since she had offered a caress to anyone . She and Ruth had not been demonstrative in recent years , and there was no one else . " I 'm in love , " Ruth sobbed . " I 'm terribly , terribly in love . "  | " Do n't cry , " Henrietta whispered . " Do n't mind , Ruthie . It 's all right . It 's not wrong . Who is it ? " " Jeremy , " Ruth said in the smallest voice . Henrietta did not release her hold . She tried to remember Jeremy 's face as she had seen it when William graduated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , very kind , this she remembered . Then she remembered slow , rather careful movements , as though something inside hurt him , and very pale and delicate hands , bony and not small . " Does he know ? " she asked . " Yes , he does , " Ruth said . She slid from Henrietta 's lap to the floor and leaned against her knee and wiped her eyes with the edge of Henrietta 's gingham skirt . " He told me first  --  I would n't have dared ? " " You mean you are engaged ? " Henrietta asked . Ruth nodded . " I suppose so  --  as soon as he dares to tell . Candace knows , but none of us dares to tell William . " " Why not ? " Henrietta said with fierceness . " Is there any reason why it is his business ? " " It just seems to be , " Ruth said . " Nonsense , " Henrietta replied . Her mind flew to Clem . Was not this the moment : to reveal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not speak of him . " I 'll tell William myself , " she declared . " Oh no , " Ruth said quickly . " Jeremy wants to do it . Ile will , one of these days . I do n't know why he thinks William wo n't like it . " " I know , " Henrietta said . Her voice was gloomy . " William does n't want the people he goes about with to think he has any family at all . Nobody is good enough for him . " " That 's not quite true , " Ruth said . " William 's very nice to me , usually . " " Because you always do what he says , " Henrietta said . " Well , usually I do n't see any reason why I should n't , " Ruth said . " Anyway , it 's to be kept a secret for a while . " She got up from the floor and went to the mirror and smoothed her curls . The intimate moment was over . William had broken it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clem . The college year began again and the sisters parted . Clem 's Sunday letters reached Henrietta on Wednesday . She had chemistry laboratory on Wednesday afternoons and among her test tubes she read the long , closely written letter lying between her notes . Then one week there came the letter she had not expected . On Thursday she scarcely ever bothered to go to see whether she had mail , but  | that day she had happened to pass by the office and , on the chance that there might be a rare letter from her mother , she stopped and found instead another letter from Clem . " Do I have to be home early ? " Bump had inquired . He was now a pudgy boy who had just begun to wear spectacles . Long ago he had given up rebelling against Clem . Clem looked at his big dollar watch . " You can stay out till eleven o'clock but you ca n't play pool . " " I was goin ' to the nickelodeon . " " All right . " Thus Clem had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Henrietta . It might have been the solitude that moved him to ask her now to marry him . It might have been his constant wish to comfort her for loneliness . It was certainly his unchanging feeling of union with her , though he had never seen her face . She was the only person in the world who could understand when he spoke about his childhood , that other world wlierc all his roots were planted so deeply that there could be no uprooting . " You and I have not met , " he now wrote . " It may seem ? " he paused here to look up the word in his diet ionary ? " presumptuous for me to have the idea . But I have it and I might as well tell you . It seems to me that you and I are meant to get married . I have not seen you nor you me , but I take it we do n't care first for looks . There is something else we have together . We understand things , or so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused here a long time . When he went on he wrote , " I do not like this idea of proposing to you by letter . if you are willing I will come to see you . Mr. Janison owes me some time and I have saved money . Bump can help in the store after school . I could get away a couple of days and have a whole afternoon with you . " When he had written these words he then went on to tell her the usual news of his life . Bump had got to like school at last and was even talking of college . He 'd have to work his way . He himself had given up hope of a real education but he read a lot , Miss Bean telling him what books . He had just finished The Wealth of Nations . It was hard going but full of sense . Then he told his big news . Mr. Janison , not having any children , had asked if he did n't want to consider taking over the store some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written this . Then he went on to tell Henrietta again what he felt and what he had never  | told anybody except her . " If I do take this store I wo n't be content just to handle the one outfit . I will likely start up my cheap food stores in other places . I have n't got it all worked out but I believe it can be done like I have told you . Farmers can sell cheap if they can sell direct . Plenty of people need to eat more and better food . I could maybe think out some way even to ship food across to the people in China , or maybe just help them over there , once I learned how here , to get their own food around . It 's really a world proposition , as I see it . " He paused again , frowned and sighed . " Henrietta , I hope you will understand that I am not just interested in material things . But I feel that if everybody had enough food so they did not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then they could think about better things . I have not the education for teaching people but I could feed them . Anyway , to my thinking , food is something people ought to have the way they have water and air . They ought not to have to ask for it or even work for it , for all have the right to live . " He paused again and closed his letter with these words . " I hope you will forget your brother William 's attitude toward you as you feel it is , and remember that I care enough to make up for it to you , if you will let me . " Such a letter deserved many readings before it was committed to certainty , and he read it again and again . There was nothing in it to change , he decided finally , although he would have liked to make it more polished in the writing since she was in college . This he did not know how to do and so he sealed it , addressed it , and took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town clock that it was a quarter past eleven . He was just beginning to allow himself to feel severe about Bump when he saw the light come on in the room above the store . The boy was home , then . Everything was all right . He walked down the street toward the store whistling slightly off key a tune whose name he did not know . This was the letter Henrietta received on Thursday . She kept it with her all night , waking twice to read it over again by the thin light of a candle shaded against her sleeping roommate . Of course she wanted to marry Clem . No man had ever asked her to marry him , no boy had ever even asked her to a dance . Yet she wanted to go slowly about loving Clem and marrying him because it was her whole romance and there would be no other . It was wonderful to feel his letter in her bosom , a warm and living promise of love . She could  | trust his love as she had not trusted even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tomorrow , in the library where it was quiet , up in the stacks where she had a cubbyhole because she was doing a piece of original research in her chemistry , she would write to Clem and tell him that if when they met , they both felt the same way .. . The next day in the cubbyhole , writing these very words , she was interrupted by her giggling roommate . " Henrietta , there 's a man wants to see you ! " " A man ? " She was incredulous , too . " A young man , terribly skinny , covered with dust ! " She knew instantly that it was ' Clem . Without a word more she ran down the narrow iron steps and across the hall , across a stretch of lawn to the dormitory sitting room . It was early afternoon and no one else was there except Clcm. 1 le stood in the middle of the floor waiting for her . " I had to come , " he said abruptly and shook her hand with a wrenching grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter . If a fellow wants to marry a girl he ought to come and say so . " " Oh , " she gasped , " that 's all right . I did n't mind . " They stood looking at each other , drinking in the detail of the flesh . They were both plain , both honest , both lonely , and one face looking at the other saw there its own reflection . " Henrietta , do you feel the way I do ? " Clem asked . His voice trembled . Henrietta flushed . Then he did not mind the way she looked , her straight dark hair , her ugly nose and small gray eyes , her wide mouth . " You might not like me  --  after you got to know me . " Her voice was trembling too . " Everything you are shines right out of you , " he said . " You 're the kind I need  --  somebody to put my faith in . Oh , I need faith ! " She gave a great sigh that ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed me , I guess . Oh , Clcm ? " They put their arms around each other awkwardly and their lips met in the passionless kiss of inexperienced love . He stayed the rest of the day and she forgot her work . They wandered together over the campus and she told him about the buildings and pointed out her window . She took him into the chemistry laboratory , empty by the end of the day , and explained to him what she was trying to do , and he listened , straining to understand the union of the elements .  | " I sure do wish I had education , " he said with such longing that she could not bear his deprivation . " Clem , why ca n't you give up the store and go to college ? Lots of the fellows work their way through , or very nearly . " He shook his head . " I ca n't afford to do it . I 'm too far on my way . Besides , I have n't time for all of it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , forninstance . I have an idea I could discover a whole lot of new foods . Has anybody gone at it that way ? " " Not that I know of , " she said . They took the eight o'clock train to town and had a sandwich together at a cheap restaurant . The night was warm and the darkness was not deep when they were finished . They walked up and down the platform together , hand in hand , dreading to part , now that they had met . " When shall we meet again ? " she asked . " I do n't know , " he said . " I ought to ask your father , I guess . Is n't that the right thing ? " " I wish nobody needed to know , " she cried with passion . " I wish you and I could just go off together and nobody ever know . " " I guess that would n't be just the right thing , " he said in a reasonable voice . " I 'd feel a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this . Maybe I ought to tell William . " " No ! " Henrietta cried . She scuffed the edge of her shoe along the black cindered ground . " I want it all to myself  --  until we really are married . " " Wo n't you tell William ? " Clem looked grave . " No , " Henrietta said in the same passionate voice . " At least we do n't have to tell William . " " He 'll have to know sooner or later , " Clem said . " Let him find out ! " she cried . The train came racketing in , drowning their voices , and they kissed again quickly , mindful of people about them though they were all strangers , and then Clem swung himself up the steps and she stood with her hands in the pockets of her green coat , watching until the train was gone .  | THERE 'S A LETTER from your mother , " Candace said to William . She never opened letters addressed to him after she discovered during her honeymoon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were stupid because she could never foresee what he would like and what he would not . But once she knew she never forgot . It was December and they were in the town house . Next week she must gather herself together for Christmas . She clung to these last days of the year , spending the midday hours in a large glass-enclosed porch . She was pregnant with her second child , and next summer there would be another baby . Just now , Willie , William 's namesake , was nearly two years old . She had been married more than five years . Shc lay on a long and comfortable chair , feeling a little exhausted , perhaps from her horseback ride in the Park . She had not told William that the doctor had forbidden riding because she did not intend to obey such orders . William , had he known , would have insisted upon obedience . He sat down beside a small metal table and tore open the envelope thick with Chinese stamps . Two letters fell out , one with his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le chose his mother 's first , for she gave him the most news about what was happening in Peking . She gave the incidents and his father provided the commentary . William was profoundly interested in what was taking place there , for he believed that it was a preliminary pattern of what must happen all over Asia , a surging rise of the common people he feared and distrusted . The mob upon the Peking street had become a memory stamped upon his brain . The one power that could control such madness was in the unconquerable Empress . He remembered the brave old face , impatient and arrogant , bent above him when he was a little boy . He remembered the times he had climbed Coal Hill to look down upon the roofs of her palaces . Having now seen many mansions , he realized that the Old Empress had a magnificence that no mere millionaire could buy . Her palaces were forbidden to all men but no one could forbid an American boy to climb a hill and look down upon her roofs of porcelain blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who passed could stare at her closed gates of enameled vermilion . Early in July his mother had written of a garden party to be given in September in the Summer Palace and to which all diplomats and their friends had been invited . Now he read that it would never take place . The Old Empress had fallen ill on a bright day in the early autumn , his mother wrote . The young Emperor , sitting at his desk , was disturbed by a eunuch running in and crying out , " The Old Buddha is dead ! " Without one word , without waiting one instant , the young Emperor began to write upon the sheet of paper he had been preparing for the brushing of a poem . Instead of the poem he wrote an order for the death of that statesman who had betrayed him to the Old Empress ten years earlier , when he had dreamed of making his country new again . Before he could seal the paper , the eunuch came running in to cry still more loudly , " The Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live weeks longer . William kept silent , for Candace could not know what the Old Empress meant to him . He read on . She had rallied more than once after that , determined to outlive the young Emperor whom she so distrusted for his eagerness to change old ways for new . he , too , was ill , and she lived and lived again when she heard he was not ( lead . When she heard that at last he was gone , she gave a great gusty sigh and was willing to die . " I of scanty merit , " the haughty old woman wrote in her last message to her people . " I have carried on the government , ever toiling night and day . I have directed the metropolitan and provincial leaders and the military commanders , striving earnestly to secure peace . I have employed the virtuous in office and I have hearkened to the admonitions of my advisors . I have relieved the people in flood and famine . By the grace of Heaven I have suppressed all rebellions and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled grimly . Brave Old Empress , brave until the end ! She had not died until she had seen that weakling ( lead , a degenerate youth , a puppet in the hands of revolutionists , who would have unleashed all the madness of the people . Candace watched him but he did not know it . She could never read his face but she saw the passing smile and wanted to know its cause . " What is it , William ? Has something happened ? " " Something is always happening , " William replied . He curved his lips downward very slightly . He was reading his father 's letter , a short one , ending as usual with a bit from the Chinese classics . " We are upon  | the threshold of wonderful events , now that the cruel old woman is gone , " his father wrote . " As Mencius said four hundred years before Christ , The people are the foundation of the State ; the national altars are second in importance ; the monarch is the least important of them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been spent here in China . It is the center of the coming world , though few know it . " William smiled again at this , a different smile . He did not for one moment believe that China was the center of the world and he did not agree with Mencius . Candace , watching his face , felt one of her waves of recklessness creep upon her . Why was she afraid of William ? She had not been afraid of him before she was married and she could think of no single reason , certainly no incident , to explain why she should now feel that he might be cruel . Jeremy was partly responsible . Jeremy was drinking too much . She had tried to say something to her father about it but he refused to believe it . His religion was a cushion against everything that he did not like and he took refuge in it without shame . There was no use in talking to her mother and she was afraid to tell William . He was hard enough upon Jeremy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief copy editor . Jeremy was managing editor and stood between Seth and William . William insisted on seeing all the copy and Seth had to make it follow the policy William outlined for his staff upon every event as it came about in the world . " We do n't have to think , " Jeremy had said with his too sprightly humor . " It 's wonderful not to have to think , Candy . It leaves you so much time . " Seth was not so gay . He refused to talk about William and with Candace he was exceedingly formal . She had to ask Jeremy what was the matter with Seth . " An independent mind , " Jeremy said with his changeless merriment . " It 's one mind too many . We do n't need it . We have William 's . " No one could contradict William . The fantastic success of his newspapers was the final answer to any disagreement with his decisions . In five years the one newspaper he had begun in New York had grown into four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco . With a wily combination of pictures , cartoons , and text , William had devised something that had become indispensable to millions of people he never saw . His papers were small enough to handle easily on the subways and while men were eating their lunches at crowded drugstore counters . He gave them exactly what they wanted : financial and business news in a brief space , with a short half column of pre-  | diction and advice ; news in carefully chosen pictures of tense drama , the photographs cropped to show nothing but concentrated action ; news in capsules of simply written , carefully shaped text , suited to millions of people who read with difficulty and thought very little , and who craved constant diversions because of their inner emptiness . William was too clever to preach . What he wanted could be done by his choice of what news to tell and how it was told . Elimination was half the secret of his power , and headlines were the rest of it . Headlines alone could tell people how to think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk of the papers and of William . They were awed by his genius while they grew more and more afraid of him . " In another ten years William will be telling the world what to think and nobody will know it , " Martin said . " Of course Aunt Rosamond simply loves it . She wo n't let him pay her back her hundred thousand . " Aunt Rosamond , as soon as she heard that Roger Cameron had given William a hundred thousand dollars , had insisted on matching it . William had returned Roger 's money but it was true that Aunt Rosamond refused any such return . " The interest is my annuity , William , dear boy , " Aunt Rosamond cackled in her hoarse old voice . She was almost blind but now and again she insisted upon a visit from William , and lie treated her half affectionately . There was something he liked in the rude , ruthless , selfish old woman who enjoyed his success and laughed at his newspapers . " Wonderful trash , " she called them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ribs with her sharp old elbow . Upon the three young men , however , William 's monstrous and increasing success was beginning to have effect . Martin had attacks of conscience , irritated by Aunt Rosamond 's greed , Seth threatened rebellion against William 's interference with copy , and Jeremy had begun to drink . The long indecision about Ruth , the months when they were half engaged , the months when he felt he did not want to marry anybody , other months when it was Ruth he did not want , had become years . Through it all her unchanging patience , her unfailing sweetness and faithful love had never let him go . In the end Ruth had won . A month ago Candace thought Jeremy had softened and become more like the boy she had always known , a moody boy , gay with a gaiety she disliked , but capable of times of thoughtful gravity , hours  | when he could talk with her , moments out of which he sometimes brought a handful of verses to be cherished . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would again and she hoped he would , for it was good for him to write poetry . Something in him was crystalized and so became permanent . She thought she understood the change in him when he told her that he had made up his mind to marry Ruth . He had really fallen in love with Ruth at last , she believed , though Jeremy gave as his reason when he told her so that Ruth was the opposite of William and therefore he could not help loving her . " But you did like William in college , " Candace said . " I got to depend on him , " Jeremy said . " I could n't have passed my exams without him . I have the same feeling now . " " You do n't have to work at all , " Candace said . " You and Ruth could live somewhere quite happily . Father would n't mind . " He looked at her with bewildered eyes . " I do n't know why I ca n't do that , " he said . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jeremy , I have n't said I 'm glad . But I think I am . Will William like it ? " " Of course he wo n't , " Jeremy said . " Even Ruth thinks that . " " Oh , why not ? " " He has an instinct to deny everybody except himself . He likes to feel he has no flesh and blood of his own . I Ie 'd like to have a myth about him that he was born without parents  --  pure son of God . " Candace was shocked . " That 's a mean thing to say when I 'm going to have a baby . " " Oh , the baby will certainly be another son of God , " Jeremy had said too flippantly . He had been lying on his back on the grass , his body limp , his voice lazy , staring at patches of sky between the leaves of the maples . Candace had not answered him . " William , " she now said , " I want to tell you something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Jeremy and Ruth are engaged at last , " she said baldly . " I 'm glad . It 's been on and off for years  --  he could n't make up his mind . " She turned her head to look at William and saw a bluish flush upon his face . " When did this take place ? " he asked . " About a month ago . " " And you have known all this time ? " " Not quite all . "  | She waited for his anger but it did not fall . The bluish flush died away and he was more ashen than ever . " Do n't you think it 's rather nice ? " she asked . He got up , his letters in his hand . " I do n't think one way or the other about it , " he said . " It seems to me a matter of no importance at all . " " Then you wo n't mind her being married here ? " " I suppose not . " " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I get too clumsy . They do n't want to wait . " " Do as you please , " William said . He hesitated a moment and then went on rather abruptly . " These letters give me an idea for an editorial I 'd like to write for tomorrow . I hope you wo n't mind if I do n't show up for dinner . " " I 'll miss you , " she said with her coaxing smile . " I 'm sorry , " he said rather formally . He bent over her , however , and kissed her hair before he went his way . She watched him as he walked and seeing his bent head , his hands holding the letters clasped behind his back , she thought suddenly that he looked like a priest . That , perhaps , was what William should have been . Ruth was married on New Year 's Eve and Henrietta was her maid of honor . Upon this Ruth had insisted , and Candace had chosen the wedding garments . Ruth of course must wear white satin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk of daffodil yellow to be worn with a wide green sash . Henrietta 's darkness was made . to glow . She did not protest . Holding within her breast the ineffable secret of Clem , she allowed herself to be dressed for the first time in her life with purpose for beauty . She was twice in William 's house , and the first time was after the fitting of her dress , when Candace brought both young women home for luncheon . William was not there , but Jeremy was . He had left the office brazenly early , without telling anybody . " What is the use of being William 's brother-in-law if I have to be afraid of him ? " he inquired of them . " He ca n't fire me . " " Oh , Jeremy , " Ruth cried , softly shocked . " Jeremy is not to be taken seriously since he grew up , " Candace told Henrietta . " He used to be quite serious when he was a little boy . " They were at the long table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian lace . They sat two by two , Henrietta beside Candace , and the ends of the table were empty , though the butler had  | set William 's place . His place was always set , whether he came or not . " When I was a little boy I was serious because I thought I was going to die , " Jeremy said , tilting his wine glass as closely as he could without spilling the red wine . " Now I know I have to live . One has to be gay when one can not escape life . Eli , Ruthie ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " Ruth cried happily . The wedding was beautiful . William gave Ruth away since their father was in Peking , and against his dignity her white softness was the contrast of a rose against rock . The wedding was in William 's house , although Ruth had wanted a church wedding , and had thought that it would be in St. John 's where William and Candace went regularly on Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Christmastime , had come into some strange conflict with the rector , which he had never explained , and had withdrawn his membership . He went to church no more and it would have been too conspicuous to have allowed the wedding to take place somewhere else . It was only a small wedding . Ruth had never come out , and she knew few people . There was no reason , William told Candace , why his friends , or hers either , should be invited to come to sec a young woman married of whose existence they had only accidentally heard . The large drawing room made a pleasant place . The florist set up an altar at one end and Ruth 's college preacher came to marry them . William was kindly even to Henrietta , and to his grandparents he was almost gentle . They had aged very much . Henrietta matched him in being kind , and thought of Clem and still could not bring herself to speak his name . None of them were staying after the wedding . They went with Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship for France . William was not with them . A call from his office had compelled him away . Then , with her daffodil dress packed carefully in her suitcase , Henrietta went home with her grandparents . That night she told them about Cletn . They sat together in the large and now rather shabby living room , and she tried to make them see why she must marry Clem . " He is the only person in the world who knows everything about me , " she told them . They listened simply , knowing somehow that there was very much that they did not know . China was a land they could not imagine and it seemed to them monstrous and inexplicable . " You wo n't be going back to that China , I hope , " her grandmother murmured .  | " I do n't know what Clem will do , " Henrietta said . " He is always thinking about the world . If he goes of course I will , too . " The old couple had had a hard day and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touched the bell . When Millie , who always sat up until the family was in bed , came he asked for milk . " Make it hot , Millie , and put a little sherry wine in it . " " I will , Mr. Vandervort , " she answered . A few minutes later , drowsily drinking his sherried milk , he nodded his head to Henrietta . " I suppose it is only what we must expect , " he said vaguely . They went upstairs to bed without asking her anything more and she sat down at her desk to write Clem a long letter . " Clem , I want to be married now . I do n't want to go on with my doctorate . . . . " After her graduation from college she had decided to go on with her doctorate in chemistry with the hope that she could be useful to Clem . This was after something he had said one day . " I do wish I could have studied chemistry , hon , " lie had said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat bean curd ? You reckon you know enough to help me , hon ? " " I 'd have to study some more , " she said . She was still a little hurt because he had cried out eagerly , " Do you reckon you could , hon ? " But she would not let herself be hurt with Clem . She knew his greatness . He could not put himself first . After she had finished college , summa cum laude , an honor of which she scorned to tell William and which Clem could not fully comprehend , and which seemed only to surprise her parents , she had entered Columbia for more work in chemistry . Now , halfway through , suddenly she could not go on . She gave her wild arguments to Clem , that nobody loved her and that she was too lonely to live . Even at college she had been lonely because , not having lived in America , she could not talk with other girls . She wanted to be with Clem , and him alone , and never leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing her education and not regretting things later , and about not being able to forgive himself if afterward she were sorry . ' When lie had a torrent of letters from her all saying the same thing over and over again , he knew that it was true that she could die of her loneliness , because it was like his , a spiritual hunger that sent out seeking roots to find an earth its own . It was time for them to come together . He went to her one day in June and made himself known to her  | grandparents to satisfy his own conscience , since he could not speak face to face with her father nor would Henrietta allow him to tell William of their love . The old couple were bewildered and anxious to do no wrong , but when Clem talked to them a while they were glad to think that there was nothing they could do . The young people had made up their minds . " You may write to Father and Mother and tell them you can not do anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We wo n't write , Henrietta . We 'll leave it to you . " " It 's up to you young people , " her grandmother murmured . " We 've done our best . " Henrietta was moved to kiss them both for the first time in her life . She was a new creature now that she had made Clem understand that it was right for them to be married at once . She was almost gay . No wedding , she said , for whom had they to invite ? As soon as Clem had the license , she and Clem and the grandparents went one evening to the parsonage of the Presbyterian church nearby and there they were married . She wore her yellow dress , and Clem bought her some shell-pink roses to hold . He had bought , too , a wide , old-fashioned gold wedding ring , the only ring she had ever possessed . When Clem put it on her finger she knew it would be there forever , enclosing dust when she was dead . They went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drink a toast in burgundy wine from a bottle her grandfather opened . Then she changed into her ( lark blue silk suit , the only new garment she had bought , and she had a strange uncertain feeling that though her grandparents yearned over her , they were glad to see her go , glad to get youth out of their aging house . They were tired and they wanted to sleep .  | VI HENRIETTA SAT SEWING in the small living room of her home . She was not good at sewing . Her fingers were clumsy and the thread knotted often , but it did not occur to her to give up merely because she was not adept and so she sewed steadily on , glancing only occasionally through the window by which she sat . The scene was simple enough , a street of cheap houses much like this one that she and Clem had rented next to the store . Whatever grace the street had came from two rows of maple trees which were now beginning to show the hues of autumn . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaves , running hither and thither , apparently unwatched unless a quarrel brought a mother to the door . " You , Dottie ! Stop kicking your little brother ! " " But I wan na ! " " I do n't care what you want . Stop it , I say ! " She wondered if Clem wanted children . They had never talked of children , each for some unspoken reason . She was not sure whether she even wanted children . She had never got used to living in America and she would not know how to bring up a child . In China there had been the amahs . Here she would have to wash all the child 's things , and tend it herself when it cried . Besides , Clem was enough . He was a dozen men in one , with all the great schemes in his head . It would be as much as she could do to see that he lived to carry them through . That he would succeed she did not doubt . hro n n the moment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had believed in him . Trust was the foundation of her love . She could not love anyone unless she trusted and for that reason she really loved no one except Clem and her father . As long as she lived she would not forgive William because he was angry when he found that she had married Clem . She had written to Ruth , after all , and at first Ruth had not dared to tell William the whole truth . She had let William think the marriage had not yet taken place and he tried to stop it , thinking it still only an engagement . He had actually cabled to Peking to his mother . When she opened the  | cable from her mother forbidding her too late to marry Clem , she had known it was William 's doing . " That ignorant fellow ! " William had called Clem , and Ruth had told her . Even Ruth was sorry . " I wish you 'd told us , Henrietta . It was n't kind . He is n't suitable for you . You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I shall never want to go to William 's house . " That was what she had answered . She would never be afraid of William , however many newspapers he had . Clem was so innocent , so good . He did not like her to say anything against William . " He 's your brother , hon  --  it would be nice if you could be friends . " That was all Clem said . When she told him how William felt about their marriage , Clem only looked solemn . " He do n't understand , hon. People are apt to make mistakes when they do n't understand . " She could not persuade him to anger . She had written to her parents herself , a vehement letter declaring her independence and Clem 's goodness , and her father had replied , mildly astonished at the fuss . " I do n't see why you should not marry Clem Miller . I should be sorry to see you in the circumstances of his father , but nowadays nobody lives by faith alone . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present a tablecloth of grass linen embroidered by the Chinese convent nuns . Henrietta guessed shrewdly that her mother did not really care whom she married . As for Clem , he wistfully admired William 's success . " If William could get interested in my food idea , now , how we could go ! He could set people thinking and then things would begin to happen . " " He does n't want them to think , " I Ienrietta said quickly . " Oh now , now ! " Clem said . The clock struck six and up and down the street the supper bells rang . She rose to look at the roast and potatoes in the oven and to cut bread and set out milk . Clem would be home soon and he would want to eat and get back to the store . She moved slowly , with a heavy grace of which she was unconscious . Her immobile face , grave under the braids of her dark hair , seldom changed its expression . Now that she was with Clem her eyes were finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her clear brows ; yet at times they held a look of inner bewilderment as though she were uncertain of something , herself perhaps ,  | or perhaps the world . It was no small bewilderment thus revealed but one as vague and large as her mind , as though she did not know what to think of human existence . The door in the narrow hall opened sharply and then shut , and the atmosphere of the house changed . Clem had come in . " Hon , you there ? " It was his greeting although he knew she was always there . " I 'm here , " she replied . Her voice was big and deep . He came to the kitchen , his light step quick moving . Their eyes met , she standing by the stove with a pot holder in her hand , and he crossing to the sink to wash . He washed as he did everything , with nervous speed and thoroughness , and he dried his face and hair and hands on a brown huck towel that hung on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was not quite as tall as she was . " Food ready ? " " I am just dishing up . " He never spoke of a meal but always of food . IIc sat down to the roast she set before him and began to carve it neatly and with the same speed with which he did all else . Two slices cut thin lie arranged on a plate for her , put a browned potato beside them , and handed the plate to her . Then he cut his own slice , smaller and even thinner . " Ca n't you eat a little more , Clem ? " Henrietta asked . " Do n't dare tonight , hon. I have a man waiting for me over there . " " You did n't want to bring him home ? " " No . I was afraid we 'd talk business all through our food and my stomach would turn on me again . I want a little peace , just with you . " She sat in silence , helping him to raw tomatoes and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke while they ate . She was used to this and liked it because she knew that in her silence he found rest . They were in communion , sitting here alone at their table . When he was rested he would begin to talk . 1 lc ate too fast but she did not remind him of it . She knew him better than she knew herself . He was made of taut wire and quicksilver and electricity . Whatever he did she must not lay one featherweight of reproach upon him . Sometimes she tortured herself with the fear that he would die young , worn out before his time by the enormous scheme he had undertaken , but she knew that she could not prevent anything . He must go his own way because for him there was no other , and she must follow . In this country which was her own , she still continued to feel a stranger and her only security was Clem . Everything else here was  | different from Peking and her childhood and she would not have known how to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him this he listened until she had finished . Then he always said the same thing , " Folks are the same anywhere , you 'll find , hon. " But they were not . Nobody in America was like the Chinese she had known in Peking . She could not talk to anybody in New Point about  --  well , life ! They talked here about things , and she cared nothing about things . " All under Heaven ... " that was the way old Mrs. Huang used to begin conversation when she went over to the Huang hutung . She looked at Clem and smiled . " Do you remember how the Chinese loved to begin by saying , All under Heaven ' ? " " And go on to talk about everything under heaven ! " " Yes  --  you remember , too . " " I wish I did n't have to hurry , hon , but I do . " " I know , I do n't know why I thought of that . " They were silent again while he cleaned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for which they sacrificed themselves . William , sitting in his splendid offices in New York , was a slave to a scheme as much as Clem was , and yet how differently and with what opposite purpose ! She could not have devoted herself to Clem had he wanted to be rich for power . 1 le did not think of money except as something to further his purpose , a purpose so enormous that she would have been afraid to tell anyone what it was , lest they think him mad . But she knew he was not mad . Clem put down his knife and fork . " Well , what 's for dessert ? " " Stewed apples . I would have made a pie but you said last time ? " " Pie wo n't leave me alone after I 've eaten it . I ca n't be bothered with something rarin ' in my stomach when I 've got work to do . " She rose , changed the plates , and brought the fruit . He ate it in a few bites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and closed his eyes . For ten minutes he would sleep . She sat motionless , not moving to clear the table or take up her sewing . She had learned to sit thus that his sleep might not be disturbed by any sound . His hearing was so sharp that the slightest movement or whisper could wake him . But she did not mind sitting and watching him while he slept . They were so close , so nearly one , that his sleep seemed to rest her , too . Only her mind wandered , vaguely awake . He opened his eyes as suddenly as he had closed them , and getting up he came back to his seat at the table facing her .  | " Hon , I feel I 'm wasting you . " She could not answer this , not knowing what he meant . " Here I have married me a fine wife , college educated , and all she does is to cook my meals and darn my socks ! " " Is n't that what wives are supposed to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondly and she flushed . She had learned now that she would never hear the words of love that women crave from men . Clem did not know them . She doubted if he had ever read a book wherein they were contained . But she did not miss them for she had never had them , either . She knew very well that Clcm was the only person who had ever loved her , and of his love she was sure , not by words but by his very presence whenever he came near . The transparency of his being was such that love shone through him like light . It shone upon her now as he sat looking at her , half smiling . She saw memory in his eyes . " Remember that brown Chinese bread we used to have in Peking , hon ? The kind they baked on the inside of the charcoal ovens , slapped against the side , and sprinkled with sesame seeds ? " " Yes , I remember . . . . the flat ones . . . . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know . I get a hankering sometimes to taste it again . What say we go back , hon ? " " To China , Clem ? " " just for a look around . I might forget what used to be if I saw what Peking is like now . " He looked white and tired and her heart felt faint . Why did she always have that premonition , undefined , unreasonable , that she was stronger than he , more indestructible , more lasting ? No flame like his burned within her , and she was not consumed . " It would be good to go back , Clem . " " Think so , hon ? Well , we 'll see . " He got up with his usual alertness and the premonition was gone . There was no reason to think  --  anything ! But when he was gone she sat thinking and idle . Yes , she remembered the loaves of sesame bread hot from the oven of the old one-eyed vender . She had often slipped through the unguarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission compound , she had waited , hidden by a clump of dwarf bamboo at the end of the wall . She could hear even now the vender 's high call as he came down the street , always at the same hour , that  | hungry midmorning hour on Saturday when she and Ruth were supposed to be doing their lessons for Monday . He always looked behind the bamboos for her and grinned when he saw her , his jaws altogether toothless . " Hot ones , " she always said . " Do I not know ? " he retorted , and reaching down into the little earthen oven he peeled the bread cakes , two of them , from the sides . His hands were always filthy . Flour and dough blackened by smoke clung in their cracks and his nails were black claws , but she would not think of that in her hunger for the bread . She paid him two pennies and ran back into the compound , the cakes under her jumper . Ruth would not eat them because his hands were dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sesame seeds nutlike in their delicacy . Clem had eaten that bread , too , but William never had . Like Ruth , William would have thought of the man 's dirty hands , but she and Clem thought of the bread , hot from the coals . It was good bread . She rose and began to clear the table . What Clem was doing was as simple as what the old vender did . Two cakes of bread , for a penny apiece ; the old vender made it and went about selling it . If it was good enough people bought it , that was all . Not only bread , either ! If anything was good enough and cheap enough , people wanted it . That was all . What Clem was doing was simple and tremendous , so simple that people did not think he was doing anything , and so tremendous they would not have believed it had they known . Only when they saw the finished thing , the bread , the meat , the food , standing there ready to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And believing they still would not understand . Sometimes at night Clem wanted to read the Bible . They did not go to church and neither of them said their prayers unless they felt like it . But sometimes he wanted to read aloud to her . The night before , when they were in bed , he had lighted the lamp and taken up the small old Bible he kept on the shelf under the bedside table . He turned to the place where Jesus had taken the loaves and fishes and had fed everybody that was hungry , and he read it slowly , almost as if to himself , while she listened . When he had read of the baskets of crumbs that were filled he closed the book and lay back oh the pillow , his hands behind his head , his eyes fixed on the ceiling . " That 's what I aim to do , " he had said . " In my own way , of course . But I like to read once in a while of how somebody else did it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to find some way of making food cheaper , hon. I wish I could make it free . There ought  | to be a way for a starving man to get food without paying for it . There must be a way . " When the table was cleared , the dishes washed , she sat down again to her sewing . The afternoon sun shone down on the quiet street . It was as peaceful and permanent a scene as a woman could look upon , and millions of women looked out upon just such quiet streets in small towns all over America . They would expect to spend their lives there , rearing their children , caring for their grandchildren . But Henrietta , lifting her eyes , knew that for her the street was only a moment 's scene . Clem wanted her to go with him , and there was no end to a road once he had set his feet upon it . Clem was master now in the store . He had bought out Mr. Janison after he and Henrietta were married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clem was immensely proud of Bump and , since he was a college graduate , Clem treated him with something like reverence . It was a miracle to Clem to see that the lost child had become a serious , spectacled young man , honest and painfully hard working  --  though unfortunately without a sense of humor . Bump listened to everything Clem said , and to his nonsense as well as to his commands , to his dreams as well as to his calculations , he gave the same intense attention . He gave his advice when Clem asked for it , which was often , and tried not to be hurt when Clem did not take it . Clem was an individual of deepest dye , and in his way a selfishly unselfish man . I le paid no heed whatever to any schemes for the benefit of mankind except his own . He was convinced more than ever that any government would fail unless people were first given a steady diet of full meals , but given this diet almost any government would do , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , always with a pad and pencil , Clem toured the country in one of the earliest of the Ford cars . In villages and out-of-the-way places , wherever crops rotted because the railroads could not serve the farmers , he found ways of conveying the foods by hack , by wagon , and as time went on by truck to railways or to markets . His markets he established anywhere there were people and food near enough to be brought together . Travelers came upon huge , hideously cheap structures in the midst of the tents of migrant workers as well as in the slums of great cities . Some of the structures were permanent , some were immense corrugated tin shacks , made to be taken away when people moved on . In spite of himself , Clem was beginning to make money . He looked  | at Bump with a lifted right brow one day and threw half a dozen checks at him across the big pine table in the back room of the store , where he made his head office . " More stuff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of ways to spend it . All I need ahead is enough to start the next market , but it keeps rolling in . Guess I 'll have to begin on the rest of the world . " In this instant an old smoldering homesickness sprang into flame . With money piling up he could go to China at last . He had no wish to stay there . He wanted merely to go back to walk again the dusty streets , to enter again Mr. Fong 's house , and to see for himself the graves of his parents and sisters . For Yusan , reviving his English , had written to him long ago that Mr. Fong had gone secretly for the dead bodies and had buried them outside the city in his own family cemetery upon one of the western hills . Upon two heavy Chinese coffins , in each of which was a child with a parent , Mr. Fong had sealed the lids , had lied to the guards at the city gate , and pretending that the dead were his brother and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the wounded bodies into the earth . Could Clem see for himself not only the graves of his dead , but also the faces of the living people friendly again and cheerful as he remembered them , then some secret load of which he never allowed himself to think might roll away . He would be homesick no more for any other country . But he could not go without Ilcnrietta . He could hop into his Ford , rebuilt to his order so that it would survive equally well the hill roads in West Virginia and the sands in Nebraska , and he could leave her for weeks , so long as they were on the same soil . But he could not contemplate the ocean between them . One day last November he had seen an item in the country newspaper , the only newspaper he read . There was no big headline , and it was not even on the front page . Nevertheless it was a piece of news whose importance no one but himself in the town , perhaps no one but himself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empress of China was dead . This in itself was enough to change the atmosphere of his living memory . Clem read and sat down on a keg and read again . So she was dead , that gorgeous and evil woman , whose legend he had heard in the city over which she had brooded , a monstrous , gaudy bird of prey ! When he thought of her gone , of Peking freed of her presence , of the palaces empty , bonds fell from his heart . His parents , his little sisters , were avenged . He need not think of them anymore . The past was ended for him .  | Now , with these checks before him , it suddenly came to him that it was time to go to China . " Bump ! " he cried . " Take over , will you ? I 'm going home . " Bump nodded , and the young clerks glared at Clem . But he saw nothing . He walked home with his brisk half trot and opened the front door and shouted : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " From far off , somewhere in the back yard where she was taking dry fresh clothes from the line , came Henrietta 's voice . " All right , Clem ! " Swaying in a temperamental train northward from Nanking , Henrietta gave herself up to nostalgia . In their small compartment Clem gazed , ruminating , from the dirty windows . It was comforting to see good green fields of cabbage and young winter wheat . The Chinese knew how to feed themselves . His stomach , always ready for protest , was soothed and he turned to Henrietta . " You know , hon ? " " What should I know ? " A flicker upon her grave lips was her smile for him . " When I get to Peking I am going to hunt tip one of those old Mohammedan restaurants and get me a good meal of hroiled mutton . I have a hunch it would set well with me . " " If you think so then it will , " she replied . They had received no mail for weeks , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents were in Peking , and soon she would meet them . How she would behave depended upon how they received Clem . Her father , she knew , would be amiable , his nature and his religion alike compelling him to this , but her mother she could not predict . To prepare them she had telegraphed from the bleak hotel in Shanghai . To this telegram she had no answer while they waited for hotel laundry to be done . Twenty-four hours was enough for laundry , but a zealous washerman starched Clem 's collars beyond endurance for his thin neck , and the starch had to he washed out again . The laundryman declared himself unable to cope with collars that had no starch , and Henrietta had borrowed a charcoal iron from a room boy and ironed for a day while Clem roamed the streets of the Chinese city . They left the next day without waiting for the telegram . Her father might be on one of his preaching trips , her mother perhaps visiting in Tientsin while he was gone . At Nanking , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel and provoking in its economy : DR . AND MRS . LANE LEFT FOR UNITED STATES . " But why ? " she asked Clem . " We 'd better go on to Peking and find out , " he said . " We 've been traveling too fast for letters , hon. " So they sat in the compartment and watched the landscape turn from rolling hills to the flat gray fields of the north . Clem was unusually silent and she knew that he was facing his own memories at last . They were tender toward each other , thoughtful about small comforts , and now and again at some well-remembered sight and sound , a chubby child barefoot in the path , the clear sad note of a blind man 's small brass gong , they looked at each other and smiled without speaking . She did not ask Clem what his thoughts were , shrinking from intrusion even of love upon that gravity . The country grew poorer as they went north and villagers , despoiled by bandits of their homes , came to the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their hands like cracked bowls , wailing aloud the disasters that had fallen upon them . A few small cash fell out of the windows of second- and third-class windows and once she put out her hands filled with small bills and saw the unbelieving joy upon the faces of the peoples . " American  --  American ! " they shrieked after her beseechingly . " I 'm glad you did that , hon , " Clem said . " It 's no use , of course , " she said and got up and went to the club car because she could not sit still . There , his back to the window and the ruined village and the beggars , a young Chinese in a long gown of bright blue brocaded silk was looking at a copy of one of William 's newspapers . She wondered how he had got the paper , but would not ask . Doubtless some American traveler had left it at a hotel , and it had been picked up eagerly , as all American papers were . She sat down near him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is this your country ? " " Yes , " she said . " It is the land of my ancestors . " " How is it that you speak Chinese ? " " I lived here as a child . " " And you come back , when you could stay in your own land ? " " Not everything there is as you see . " " But this is true ? " He kept his eyes upon pictures of rich interiors of millionaires '  | houses , upon huge motor cars and vast granaries and machinery which he could not comprehend . " Such things can be found , " she admitted . She wanted to explain to him how anything was true in America , all that he saw and all that was not there for him to see . But she knew it was no use beginning , for he would only believe what he saw , and then she was really convinced that William had done this with purpose , that there would never be anything in the pages of William 's papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted them to see . And so , no one would ever really know America , and to her the best of America was not there , for the best was not in the riches and the splendor , in the filled granaries and the machines . She got up because she did not want to talk to the young man any more and went back to the little compartment . Clem sat asleep , his head bobbing on his thin neck . A frightening tenderness filled her heart . He was too good to live , a saint and a child . Then she comforted herself . Surely his was the goodness of millions of ordinary American men , whether rich or poor , and Clem was not really a rich man , because he did not know how to enjoy riches , except to use them for his dreams of feeding people . He liked his plain old brass bed at home , a thing of creaking joints and sagging wire matt ress , and he still thought a rocking chair was the most comfortable scat man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways very ignorant , but all the beauty of America was in him , because he talked to everybody exactly the same way and it did not occur to hint to measure one man against another or even against himself . She sat down beside him . Softly she put her arm around him and drew his head down to rest upon her shoulder and he did not wake . In Peking Clem continued silent . Against his will the horror of old memories fell upon him . Here he had been an outcast child respected neither by Americans nor Chinese , because of his father 's faith and poverty . By accident the hotel where he and Henrietta lodged was upon the very street where he had fought the baker 's son and where William had descended from his mother 's private riksha . He pointed out the spot to Henrietta ten minutes after they had entered the room and for the first time he told her the story . Listening , she discerned by the intuition which worked only toward Clem , that the old pain still lingered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fierceness.  | Clem shook his head at this . He was repelled by judgments . " I was a pitiful specimen , I guess . " He dismissed himself . " We 'd better go and find out about your folks , hon. " So they left the hotel and walked down the broad street , followed by clamoring riksha men who felt themselves defrauded of their right to earn a living when two foreigners walked . " I 'd forgotten how poor the people are . I guess I never knew before , being so poor myself . " " Here is the back gate of the compound , " Henrietta said . " I used to creep out here to buy steamed meat rolls and sesame bread . " They entered the small gate and walked to the front of the square brick mission house . " I was here once , " Clem said . " It all looks smaller . " The house was locked , but a gateman ran toward them . " Where is Lao Li ? " Henrietta asked . The gateman stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village . How did you know him ? " " I grew up here , " Henrietta said . " I am the Lane elder daughter . Where are my parents ? " The gateman grinned and bowed . " They have gone to their own country , Elder Sister . Your honored father grew thin and ill . He goes to find your elder brother , who is now a big rich man in America . " " Can it be ? " Henrietta asked of Clem . " Could be , hon  --  want to go right home ? " She pondered and spoke after a nn , nn  --  nt . " No  --  we 're here . Have n't I forsaken them to cleave to you , ( lcm ? I really have . Besides , Mother would go straight to William , not to mc . " Clem received this without reply , and they went away again . The quiet compound , budding with spring , was like an island enclosed and forgotten in the midst of the city . ' I'lie only sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far end of the lawn , digging clover and shepherd's-purse to add to their meal that night . " It all seems dead , " Henrietta said . " It is dead , hon , " Clem replied . " In its way all that old life is dead , but the ones who live it do n't know it  --  not even your father , I guess . What say we find the Fongs ? " Mr. Fong had prospered during the years of civil war . Ignoring the political maneuvers of military men and passing by in silence the rantings of students upon the streets , he had begun to stock his book shop with other things people wanted to buy , needles and threads , brightly  | colored woolen yarns , clocks and dishes , machine-knitted vests and socks , leather shoes and winter gloves , pocketbooks and fountain pens and tennis shoes , pencils and rubber hot-water bottles . Most of his goods came from Japan and he was uneasy about this , for young students who were also zealous patriots often ransacked shops , heaped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows announcing that so and so was a traitor and a Japan lover . Mr. Fong made two cautious trips a year to Japan to buy goods , and he had consulted with the Japanese businessmen with whom he did such profitable trade , and thereafter his goods were marked " Made in USA . " A small shipping town in Japan was named Usa for this convenience . Mr. Fong had then continued to prosper without sense of sin , for he considered all warfare nonsense and beneath the notice of sensible businessmen . He had peace of mind in other ways , for his family shared his health and prosperity and his eldest son had continued to improve the English which Clem had long ago begun to teach him . Yusan was now a tall youth , already married to a young woman his parents had chosen for him , and she had immediately become pregnant . On a certain clear cool day in early spring Mr. Fong felt that life would be entirely good if politicians and soldiers and students were cast into the sea . His content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lard that Mrs. Fong was mixing together in preparation for some cakes , helped by his eldest daughter , who was already betrothed to a young man whose father was a grain dealer . Mr. bong 's two younger sons , Yuming and Yuwen , were playing with jackstones in the court , for the holiday of the Crack of Spring had begun . Upon this pleasant household Clem and Henrietta arrived . The door was opened by Yuwen , who had been born after Clem went away . Nevertheless the American was a legend in the Fong family and Yuwen recognized him with alacrity and smiles . 1 lc left the door ajar and ran back to tell his father that Mr. Mci had come hack . Mr. Fong dropped his pipe and shouted for Yusan , who was in his own part of the house and made haste to the gate . With hands outstretched he greeted Clem . " You have come back ? you have come back ! " he spluttered . " Is this your lady ? Come in  --  come in  --  so you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clem said . Thus Clem with Henrietta at his side entered again this fragment of the old world of his childhood and smelled again the familiar smells of a Chinese household , a mingling of sweetmeats and incense and  | candles of cowfat . There was even the old faint undertone of urine , which told him that Mr. Fong had not become more modern during the years and that he still stepped just outside his door when it was necessary . Smell of whitewash from the walls , smell of old wood from the rafters , and the damp smell of wet flagstones in the court were all the same . The pomegranate tree was bigger , and the goldfish in the square pool , roused by the sun , were huge and round . Clem gazed down into the shallow pool . " Same fish ? " " The same , " Mr. Fong said . " Here everything is the same . " A scream made them turn . Mrs. Fong rushed out of the open doors of the central living room . " You are come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in both of hers . " He is like my son , " she told Henrietta . Her round face was a net of smiling wrinkles . " You must take her for your daughter-in-law , " Clem said . " Her father is Lane Teacher . " " A good man , a good man ! " Mr. Fong cried . Yusan came out next and he and Clem shook hands in the foreign fashion , and then Yusan put his hand over Clem 's . " We have often asked the gods to bring you back to us . " To Henrietta he said with great courtesy , " My inner one asks you to go to her . She is very big just now with our first child , and does not like to come out before men she has not seen before . " " Come with me , " Mrs. Fong said , and Henrietta stepped over the high wooden threshold . " We will sit in the sun , " Mr. Fong said to Clem . " I do not need to be polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand there staring . Go and fetch tea and food . " The three men sat down upon porcelain stools set in the court and Mr. Fong surveyed with love this one returned . " You are too thin , " he tgld Clem . " You must cat more . " " Elder Brother , I have a weak stomach , " Clem replied . " Then you are too agitated about something , " Mr. Fong said . " Tell me what it is . You must not agitate yourself . " Thus invited Clem began talking , as he always did sooner or later , about his hope of selling cheap food even here in China . Mr. Fong and Yusan listened . Yusan never spoke before his father did , and Mr. Fong said , " What you have undertaken is far beyond the power of one man . It is no wonder that you have a weak stomach and that you are too thin . A wise man measures his single ability and does not go beyond it . What you are doing is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Empress ever did . As for these new men we have now , they do not think of such a thing as feeding the people . " " Are they worse rulers than the Old One ? " Clem asked . Mr. Fong looked in all four directions and up at the empty sky . Then he drew his seat near to Clem 's and breathed these words into his ear . " In the old days we had only certain rulers . There was the Old Buddha and in each province the viceroy and then the local magistrate . These all took their share . But now little rulers run everywhere over the land . It is this little man and that little man , all saying they come from the new government and all wanting cash . We are worse off than before . " The two younger boys came out with an old woman servant bringing some of the new cakes and tea . " Eat , " Mr. Fong said . " Here your mind may be at peacc and your stomach will say nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetmeat , but lie was suddenly hungry for these cakes that he remembered from his childhood . He took one and ate it slowly , sipping hot tea between each hit e . " When one eats lard and sugar , " Mr. Fong said , " hot tea should surround the food . . . . Thus also one drinks wine with crabs . " Clem said , " Strange that I do feel peace here as I have felt it nowhere else . In spite of the wars and the new rulers , I feel peace here in your house . " His Chinese lay ready on his tongue . I le spoke it with all the old fluency and ease . His thoughts flowed into soft rich vowel sounds in the rising and falling tones . " We are at peace here , " Mr. Fong agreed . " The outside disturbance has nothing to do with our peace within . Stay here with us , live here , and we will make you well . " In a corner Yuming and Yuwen were eating cakes heartily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose and blinked his marble-round eyes at the hot delicious fragrance . It did not occur to either boy to share his cake with the dog . To give a beast food made for human beings would have been a folly , and the Fongs did not commit follies . A hard , age-old wisdom informed them all . Clem sat watching , . relaxed , though he was not less aware of all that waited upon his conscience . Peace was sweet , and sweet it was to find nothing changed . Of all places in the world , here was no change . In the small square central room of the three rooms which Mr. Fong had allotted for his son and his son 's wife , Henrietta sat be-  | tween Mrs. Fong and jade Flower , who was Yusan 's wife . Each held one of her hands and stroked it gently , gazing at her and asking small intimate questions . " How is it you have no child ? " Mrs. Fong asked . " I have never conceived , " Henrietta replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer speak Chinese , but it was there , waiting the sight of a Chinese face . Something warmly delicate , the old natural human understanding she remembered so well and had missed so much was between her and these two . Mrs. Fong exclaimed in pity . " Now what will you do for your him ? " " Him " was husband . Mrs. Fong was too well bred to use the word . " What can I do ? " Henrietta asked . Mrs. Fong drew nearer . " You must mend your strength . You are both so thin . Stay with us and I will feed you plenty of red sugar and blood pudding . That is very good for young women who do not conceive quickly . When you have been with us a month , I will guarantee that you will conceive . My son 's wife was less than that . " " Fourteen days , " Jade Flower said in a pretty little voice , and giggled . Mrs. Fong frowned at her , then smiled and concerned herself again with Henrietta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Much more , " Henrietta said . Mrs. Fong looked alarmed . " You should not have waited so long . You should have come to us before . Do they not understand what to do in your country ? " " Perhaps they are not so anxious for children , " Henrietta replied . She could not explain to this woman , who was all mother , that Clem was somehow her child as well as her husband , and that she did not greatly care if there were no children , because she did not need to divide herself . Mrs. Fong would not have understood . Was it not for the man 's sake that a wife bore children ? " It may be better to take a second wife for him and let her bear the children for both of you , " Mrs. Fong said . " This is not allowed in our country , " Henrietta said . Mrs. Fong opened her eyes . " What other way is there for childless wives ? " " They remain childless , " Henrietta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what does he say ? " " He is good to me , " Henrietta said .  | " He must be very good , " Mrs. Fong agreed . She stroked Henrietta 's hand again . " Nevertheless , it is not wise to count on too much goodness from men . Little Sister , you shall drink red sugar in hot water and I will kill one of our geese and make a blood pudding . " She looked at Henrietta . " Can you , for the sake of a child , drink the blood fresh and hot ? " " I can not , " Henrietta said quickly . " That is what I did , " Jade Flower urged . " I drank it one day and soon I had happiness in me . " Mrs. Fong frowned at her daughter-in-law and smiled at Henrietta . " We must not compel , " she advised . " Not all women are alike . Some women can not drink blood , not even to have a child . If they drink it , they vomit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two or three puddings , one every day . Then we will see  --  we will sec ? " and she stroked Henrietta 's hand . " You trouble yourself without avail , " Mr. Fong said t o Clem . They had been several days in Peking , living in the home of t he Fong family . Clem 's digestion ran smoothly and he was more quiet in mind than he had been for years . " How do I trouble myself ? " he asked . They sat in the big family room , a comfortable , shabby , not too-clean place , where the dogs wandered in and out and the rats sprawled in the warmest spot of sunshine , and neighbor children came to stare at the Americans , while Mrs. Fong bustled everywhere . 1 lenrietta was unraveling an old sweater to knit a new jacket and cap for the Fong grandchild to be born now at any hour . Mr. Fong cleared his throat and spat into a piece of brown paper , which he then threw under the table . " You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . This is a dangerous dream . It only gives you the stomach trouble of which you have told me . Nothing is more dangerous than for one man to think he can do the work of all men . " Clem 's skin prickled at this criticism . He was secretly proud of his dream , which he had done so much to fulfill . At heart a truly modest man , he had nevertheless the modest man 's pride in his modesty in the face of achievement . Mr. Fong , wrapped in an ancient black silk robe long since washed brown and ragged at the edges , perfectly understood what Clem was feeling . He looked at him over his brass spectacles and said , emphasizing his words with his forefinger , " It is presumptuous for man to consider himself as a god . The head raised too high even in good will  | be struck off too soon . Each should tend only his own . Beyond there is no responsibility . " He picked up a cat that happened to be lying by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This creature is blind . I do not feed any of the cats , not even this one . They are here to catch mice . But the other cats bring at least one mouse each day to this blind cat . " The aged cat , outraged by his grasp , now scratched him with both hind and forelegs and yowled . Immediately three cats came into the room and looked pleadingly at Mr. Fong , who dropped the cat and wiped his bleeding hand on his gown . " Please continue to teach my husband , " Henrietta said . " I want him to live a long life . " Mr. Fong inclined his head . He was so much older than Clem that he knew he could say anything to him . Meanwhile nothing Clem said impressed him . Yusan listened with deference , since in this case he was the younger man , but he had no wish to take the part which Clem wanted to put upon him . " I shall certainly see that my own family is fed , and such others as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go further . " This was Yusan 's conclusion . He went about these clays from shop to house in perpetual readiness to hear a small loud cry from the three rooms which were his home under this roof , and he was impervious , in his generation , to the cries of others . Clem , walking with Henrietta one afternoon upon the city wall , a vantage which gave them a wide view over the roofs of houses and the green trees of the courtyards , paused to gaze down into the vast square of the city . The palace roofs were brilliant under the sun of autumn and the temple roofs were royal blue . " I guess Yusan does n't get my ideas , " he said sadly enough to arrest Henrietta 's wandering attention . " Oh well , " she replied for comfort , " there are n't any very hungry people around . Maybe that 's why . Even the beggars are fat . " She loved Clem with the entire force of her nature but she had never shared his sense of mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this city where she had spent her childhood and where she had learned early that women were of little value . It was a lesson to be learned soon , for it needed to be lifelong . Nothing in America had taught her more or differently . She was useful to Clem , and as long as he needed her , her life had meaning . " I wish I could see Sun Yatsen , " Clem said suddenly . " I believe he 'd understand what I 'm talking about . "  | " Who knows where he is ? " Henrietta asked . Clem paused for thought . " I believe Yusan knows . " " Then ask him , " Henrietta suggested . Instead Clem decided to ask Mr. Fong . He did not believe that there were secrets between this father and son . Mr. Fong received the question with calm . " The time is not ripe for Sun Yatsen 's return , " he said . " Where is he , then ? " Clem demanded . " Perhaps in Europe , perhaps in Malaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his powers . " " At least he is not in China ? " " Certainly he is not in China , " Mr. Fong said firmly . Clem said no more . The atmosphere in Peking was one of waiting , neither anxious nor tense . Empire had gone , in all hut name , and the people did not know what came next . But they were at peace . They had never been dependent upon rulers and governments . Within themselves they had the knowledge of self-discipline . Fat hers commanded sons , and sons did not rebel . All was in order , and would remain in order so long as the relationship held between the generations . Meanwhile the people lived and enjoyed their life . Clem 's early mood of unusual relaxation changed to restlessness . The peace of the Fong household began to weigh on him . ' I'lie grandchild was born , fortunately a son , and Yusan was inuuediately absorbed in fatherhood . Old Mr. Fong relapsed into being a contented grandfather . Although Clem and his wife were welcome to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the family . The end of the visit came on the day when Mr. Fong and Yusan hired four rikshas and took Clem and Henrietta outside the city walls to the graves upon the hills . The visit had been many times postponed , Mr. Fong saying that Clem must not be disturbed by sorrow until his digestion was sound . Suddenly he had decided upon the day , and Yusan had so told Clem on the night before . " Elder Brother , my father has prepared the visit to your family tombs . Tomorrow , if you are willing ? " " I am ready , " Clem said . So they had set out , and an hour 's ride had brought them before two tall , peaked graves . Clem stood with bowed head while Mr. Fong and Yusan thrust sticks of incense into the ground and lit them and Henrietta picked wild flowers and laid them upon the weedy sod . There was no other prayer . Clem took Henrietta 's hand and they stood  | together for a few minutes , he remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforting him . When the moments were over they got into their rikshas again , and when Clem got back he went aside with Mr. Fong and tried to tell him his gratitude . " You have kept the graves of my parents as though they were your own family , " Clem said . " Are not all under Heaven one family ? " Mr. Fong replied . Nevertheless he perceived thereafter Clem 's restlessness . One day he invited Clem to come into his private office , a small square room behind the shop , with enclosed shelves upon which were the old account books of five hundred years of Fong shopkeepers . Mr. Fong closed the door carefully and motioned Clem to a seat . Then he opened a drawer of his desk and took out a slip of paper upon which an address was brushed in Chinese characters . " Go to this place , " Mr. Fong said . " You will find the one you seek . Give him my name to send you in , and if he asks for further proof , describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you sit . " Clem looked at the paper . It bore an address in San Francisco . " You had better go at once , " Mr. Fong said . " He comes back soon . Something will happen this very month here in this city . Whether it fails or succeeds he will come back . If it is successful he will take power . If it fails , he must come to comfort his followers . " Clem got up . " Thank you , Elder Brother , " he said to Mr. Fong . " I hope I can repay you for your faith . I hope he 'll listen to me . " The next day he left Peking , I lcnrietta with him , but not yet understanding why he must go away so quickly . " I 'll tell you , hon , " Clem said . " 1 ' 11 tell you as soon as I have time . " There was time only when Clem was imprisoned by the sea . In Shanghai he spent money like the rich man he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the dawn after they had arrived . He could haggle over the price of an overcoat and he had never worn a custom-made suit in his life , but when it was a matter of getting what he wanted , money was only made to be used . They caught the ship and Clem , studying timetables , planned the swiftest route from Vancouver to San Francisco . The English ship was still the most swift . " One of these days we 'll fly , hon , " Clem said to Henrietta . " Before I die , that will surely be . " " We 'll fly in heaven , I suppose , " Henrietta said now with her small smile .  | " Long before that , " Clem said . " It 'll be a sorry thing for many if they have to wait for heaven ! " At last , almost reluctantly , on the second day out , he told Henrietta why it was he wanted to see that man , Sun Yatsen . " He 's going to get China , see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people there are just waiting for somebody to save them and he has risen out of nowhere , the way savior men always ( 1o . They come up out of the earth , see ? They get an idea , a big idea  --  just one is enough . He 's got the idea of giving the Chinese people their own government . Well , he 'll do it if he can get them to believe in him . People got to have faith , hon. He 's got to have faith , too . Everybody who does anything has got to have faith in a big idea . So I 'm going to him and I 'm going to say , look , if you give the people food , they 'll believe in you . Now how are you going to give your people food ? Some men do it one way , some another , but nobody ever got people to follow him without giving them food . People have got to be fed . Remember Jesus and the loaves and fishes . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 1 lenrietta was lying on the long chair he had lugged here by a lifeboat on the highest deck , away from everybody as she liked to he . By squinting a little she gazed at his face , and imagined that the bright sea shone through his eye sockets , so blue were his eyes this day . The color of his eyes was a barometer of the measure of his hope . When he was on the crest of a new hope , his eyes were sea blue , and when he was cast down , as sometimes he was , they were almost gray . " He 'll listen to you , " Henrietta said . " I 'm sure he will listen to you . " The train from Vancouver reached San Francisco just after sunset . Clem deserted Henrietta at the station . " Hon , you can get yourself to the hotel , ca n't you ? IIop into a hack with our stuff . I guess the Cliff House is all right . Wait there for me  --  do n't go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fantasy that Henrietta must not walk out alone after dark lest she be molested . " You 'd better tell me where you are going , " Henrietta said . " If you do n't come back I 'll know where to look for you . " " I 'll get back all right , " Clem said . " Chinese all know me , I guess . " He hurried off , too busy to do what she asked , jumped into a horse cab and gave directions . Then he sat , taut , leaning dangerously forward while the cabman drove him over the rough streets . He sought the Chinese rebel in one of the miserable tin shacks which had sprung  | up in the ruins of old Chinatown after the great fire . The old dark beautiful city within a city , small and close , set like a gem within San Francisco  --  the haunted narrow streets that were the center of Chinese life transplanted and nourished by generations of homesick Chinese ? had been wiped out . Those living creatures who remained alive had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets , still dazed and lost . There was no beauty springing new from ashes . Clem , however , did not include beauty within the necessities . Oblivious to ugliness , he dismissed the cab and walked briskly through the dim streets to the address he had memorized , so often had he read it . Even the smell of old Chinatown was gone , that mingling of herbs and wine , that scent of sandalwood and incense , that sad sweetness of opium and the lusty reek of roasting pork and garlic and noodles frying in sesame oil . The sound of temple bells was gone , and the venders were no more . The clash of cymbals from the theater was silenced and the theater itself was still in ruins . Instead the night air was weighted still with the acrid smell of ash and seaweed and charcoal smoke from the braziers of families cooking in the open . On the old Street of Gamblers , its iron gates a ruin of twisted rust , Clem found the place he sought . The door was locked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was not opened at once and he heard the sound of voices within . " Open the door ! " a strong voice said . " Of whom am I afraid ? " Then it was opened , and a cautious yellow face peered into the twilight . " What ting you want ? " the face asked . " I am looking for the Elder Brother , " Clem said in Chinese . Clem held up his left hand and on the palm he traced with the forefinger of his right hand the ideograph of Sun . " Come in , " the face said . The door opened widely enough to let Clem in . The shack was one room , partitioned by a curtain , and it could be seen that it belonged to a laundryman . The face belonged to the laundryman and he went back to the table piled with the clothes he was ironing , paying no further heed to Clem . Two men sat at a small table scarcely larger than a stool . One was Sun Yatsen , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clem spoke to Sun . " I am sent here by Mr. Fong , the bookseller on Hatamen Street , in Peking . " " I know him , " Sun replied in a quiet voice . " I have come with an idea which may be useful to you , " Clem said .  | " I have no seat to offer you , " Sun replied . " Pray take mine . " He rose , but Clem refused . The laundryman came forward then with a third stool and Clem sat down . Sun did not introduce the American . " Proceed , if you please , " he said in his strangely quiet voice . " I am to set sail shortly for my own country , and these last days , perhaps hours , are valuable to me . " " Has the news been good or bad ? " Clem asked . " It is bad , " Sun said . " I am used to bad news . But I must get home . " The hunchback interrupted him with a high sharp positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have an army . No revolution has ever succeeded until there was an army . " " Perhaps , " Sun Yatsen said , without change in voice or face . " I have n't come to talk about an army , " Clcm said . I le felt uncomfortable in the presence of the white-faced hunchback . He hated intrigue and he did not believe revolutions were necessary . People fought when they got hungry . When they starved they were desperate . But after it was over everything depended again on whether the new rulers fed them . If not , it all began over again . " I want to talk to ' you about food , " Clem said abruptly . " I want to tell you what I believe . People will never be permanently at peace unless the means of getting food is made regular and guaranteed . Now I have worked out a plan . " He leaned forward , and began to speak in Chinese . Thus he shut out the hunchback . He had a feeling that the hunchback was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifetime of pain and misfortune , spoke cruelty and violence . But if he had thought by speaking in Chinese to drive the man away , he failed . The hunchback waited motionless , his eyes veiled as though he were asleep . The laundryman stopped ironing and listened to Clem 's quick , persuading words . " True , true , " he muttered , to no one . Clem 's eyes were fixed upon the face of the revolutionist . He studied the high forehead , the proud mouth , the wide nostrils , the broad and powerful skull . He could not tell whether or not he was impressing his own faith upon this man . Sun Yatsen was a good listener . He did not interrupt . When Clem had made plain his desire to organize in China a means of food distribution that would guarantee the contentment of the people , Sun Yatsen shook his head . " I have only so much money . I can choose between an army which will fight the enemies of the people and set up a righteous government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , or I can , as you suggest , merely feed the people . " " Your government will not stand if the people are not fed , " Clem said . Sun Yatsen smiled his famous winning smile . " I have no government yet . First must come first , my friend . " " Only if the people have food will they believe in you , " Clem said . " When they believe in you , you can set up what government you choose . " " It depends on one 's point of view , " Sun Yatsen said suddenly in English . " If I set up a government then I shall be able to feed the people . " The hunchback came to life . He opened his narrow and snakelike eyes . " Exactly , " he said . " Force comes first . " Clem got to his feet . " It is a misfortune that I did n't find you alone , " he said to Sun Yatsen . " I guess I have failed . But you will fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else will come in and the way they will get in is just by promising the people food . Maybe they wo n't even have to deliver . Maybe by that time the people will be so hungry that just a promise will be enough . " Sun Yatsen did not answer for a moment . When he did speak it was to say with the utmost courtesy as he rose to his feet : " I thank you , sir , for seeking me out . Thank you for caring for my people . I am touched , if not convinced . " His English was admirable , the accent faintly Oxford . It was far better , indeed , than Clem 's American speech , tinged with the flatness of Ohio plains . " Good night , " Clem said . " I wish you luck , anyway , and I hope you wo n't forget what I 've said , even if you do n't agree with me , because I know I 'm right . "  | VII CANDACE FELT THAT William was annoyed . He stooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mood after these years of marriage and she saw a wintry stillness gathered about his heavy brows and firm mouth . When he spoke his voice was formal . " I am sorry to be late . " " Are you late ? " She yawned nicely behind her hand . " Then I 'm late , too . I was tired when I came home from the matinee . " " Was the play good ? " " You would n't think so . " She rose from the chaise longue where she had been drowsing and looked from the window . Far below the vast park lay in shadows , pricked with lights . " I do hope the children are home . Nannie keeps them out too late . She is a fiend for fresh air . " " There was a strong draft along the hall from the nursery door and so I suppose they are home , " William replied . " Why do you think her first impulse upon entering a room is to open the windows ? " She asked the useless question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked off when she threw herself down . William seated himself in a chair and took his characteristic pose , his small dark hands gripped together , his legs , long and thin , crossed . Whatever the fashions for men , he wore his favorite gray , dark with a faint pinstripe , and his tie was dark blue . He did not answer his wife . ' I'liis , too , was usual . Candace asked many questions she did not expect to have answered . They were the queries of her idle mind . He had once given them thought until he discovered them meaningless . She straightened her skirt and sauntering to her dressing table she picked up a brush and began smoothing out her short curls . Something was wrong but if she waited William would tell her . It might be anything , perhaps that he did not like the odor of food floating upstairs from the basement kitchen . The maids left the doors open in spite of her orders . Perhaps it was only while watching her as she brushed her hair he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut against his wishes . " I had a letter from my father today , " William said abruptly .  | " I thought something was wrong , " she said , not turning around but seeing him very well in the mirror . His face , always ashen , was no more so than usual . Something in his Chinese childhood , a doctor had said , perhaps the dysentery when he was four , had left his intestines filled with bacteria now harmless but more numerous than they should be . " They have decided to take their furlough , after all , " he said . She went on brushing her hair , watching his face . " That 's good news , is n't it ? I have never seen your father , and the boys have never seen even your mother . " He frowned and the thick dark brows which always gave his face such somberness seemed to shadow and hide his deep-set eyes . " It is a bad time for me , nevertheless . I 'd just decided to launch the new paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirled around . " Oh , William , you are n't going to start something more ! " " Why not ? " " But we do n't see anything of you as it is ! " " I sha n't need to work as long hours as I did with the others . I 've made my place . " " But why , when we 're making money ? You sacrifice yourself and us for nothing , darling ! " She let the brush fall to the floor and flew to his side and dropped on her knees , leaning her elbows on his lap and beseeching him . " I have always to take the boys everywhere without you . All last summer at the seashore you only came down for week ends , and scarcely that ! It is n't right , ' William , now when they 're beyond being babies . I did n't say anything when you were getting started , but today , just when I was thinking we might go to the theater sometimes together ! " He was entirely conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given much to be able to yield himself to her but he could not . Some inner resistance kept him even from her . He did not know what it was , but he felt it like an iron band around his heart . He could not give himself up to anyone , not even to his sons . He longed to play on the floor , to roll on the carpet as Jeremy did with his little daughters , but he could not . He was most at ease when he sat behind his great desk in the office giving orders to the men whom he employed . " I went to the theater with you only last week , " he reminded her . " But that was an opening night and you know what people go to  | that for  --  to see and be seen . I want us just to go sometimes all by ourselves , and only for the play . " He did not enjoy the theater but he had never told her so . He could never forget that it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was fed daily by the excitement of his own life , his secret power which he felt growing beneath the power of the printed words he set upon his pages . He alone chose those words . What he did not want people to know he did not allow to be printed . They learned only what he selected . Sometimes , meditating upon his responsibility , he felt himself chosen and destined for some power over men which he had not yet reached . He had been reared in Calvinism and predestination , but in his rebellion against his childhood he had rejected all that his father taught him . He had become almost an atheist while he was in college . Now he was made religious by his own extraordinary success . In the few years since he had put out the first of his newspapers , their sales had soared into millions . Yet he was not satisfied . Even now , traveling upon a train , he could feel vaguely hurt that on every other seat there should be lying the crumpled sheets of a paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so carefully made . Then his mood changed to pride . There were two of his papers to one of any other . Such colossal success meant something . There was a God , after all  --  and predestination . " What are you thinking about ? " Candace asked . The question slipped from her tongue and she wanted it back instantly but it was too late . William disliked to he asked what he was thinking about . It was an intrusion and she knew now that he guarded himself even from her . It had taken her time to learn this and meantime she had wept a good deal alone . Tears , she had now learned , only irritated him . She shed no more of them . " No  --  do n't answer me , " she said and impulsively she put her crossed fingers on his lips . He took her hands rather gently , however , and did answer her . " I was thinking , Candy , that it is a great responsibility for one man to know that he feeds the minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Three million ? " " That is the number of our readers today . Rawlston gave me the last figures just before I came home . A year from now he says it will be twice that n'imber . I suppose I am worth more than a million dollars , now . " She was used to her father 's joking , " A millionaire ? Nothing to it . Just keep ridin ' high and never look down . "  | " You 've made a great success , William . " She was not at all sure that this was the right thing to say and with his next words she knew it was not . " I 'm not thinking only in terms of personal success . It is easy to be successful here in America . Anyone with brains can make money . " " But you do like money , William . " Her sense of being wrong compelled her to justify what she had said . Besides , it was true . In his own way William valued money far more than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to have money . " His voice was dry , his eyes severe and gray . " Without it one is hamstrung . There is no freedom without money . " She remembered something she had heard her father once say . " A man needs enough room to swing a cat in . " Room , that was what money gave . A big house to live in , months in which to idle beside the sea , to live winter in summer and summer in winter , to buy without asking the price . " Yet you do n't seem to enjoy life very much , William , " she said rather painfully . She had a profound capacity for enjoyment without a sense of guilt . Her father had frankly enjoyed getting rich and he distrusted all charities . She teased him sometimes by saying that he had become a Christian Scientist so that he could ignore the sufferings of others . He had grinned and refused to be teased . " Maybe you 're right , daughter . Who knows why we do anything ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody starving , with my own eyes , I 'll feed ' em . I wo n't pay out good cash for what I do n't see . Ten to one they 're lazy . If they hustled like I did .... " Even going to church , while a social duty , had nothing to do with giving his money to strangers . Roger Cameron had cultivated no conscience in his children and Candace had grown up believing that pleasure was her normal occupation , once the dinner was planned and the children cared for . But no pleasure she devised could coax William from himself , or whatever it was that he dwelled upon in his soul . A ball which she planned as happily as a child might plan a birthday party fretted him with detail . A dish badly served spoiled his dinner . A servant who was not well trained  --  but of servants she would not think . He demanded of those in his service a degree of obedience and respect and outward decorum which had made her wretched until her father had found her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her alone when he knew William was at his office . He took a cab  | and came all the way from Wall Street to arrive at three o'clock in the afternoon or at eleven o'clock in the morning . On one such a visit he said , after he had inquired as to the cause of the tears his shrewd eyes had seen in spite of powder and even a dash of rouge , " You ca n't find Americans who 'll give William the service he wants . We do n't respect ourselves enough yet . We 've always got to be showing that we 're independent and do n't have to obey anybody . Besides , we 're too honest . When we hate anybody we act ugly . You hire your house full of English , Candy  --  they can act nice while they 're stirrin ' up poison for you . An English servant can polish your shoes as though he loved it . Of course he do n't . " So she had filled the house with English servants , and a butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . " I do n't know that life is merely to be enjoyed , " William now said . She was still crouching beside him . Idly she had taken one of his hands and playing with the fingers , she noticed the strange stiffness of his muscles . " What 's life for ? " she asked , not expecting an answer . " I do n't know , I do n't suppose anyone does , exactly . We 're here , that 's all . " " It is for something more than amusement . " He disliked her playing with his hand and he drew it away , ostensibly to light a cigarette . She felt his dislike and got to her feet gracefully , took his head between her hands and kissed his forehead . " Poor darling , you 're so serious . " " I do n't need your pity . " " Oh , no , William , I did n't mean that . Only , I enjoy life so much . " She drew back and met the hurt look she feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ? She cried out . " I low silly we are to keep talking about nothing when you have n't even told me your real news ! When are your father and mother coining ? " He was relieved to be able to withdraw from her . " 1 had a cable this afternoon . They sailed the thirteenth on an Empress ship . " " Then in a fortnight ? " " More or less . Just when I shall be busiest . " " Never mind , I 'll look after them . Dad has time , too , now he 's retired enough to stop away from the once if he likes . And there 's Jeremy and Ruth ? " " I shall need Jeremy . " Of the young men with whom he had begun the paper only Jeremy was left . One by one the others had deserted him . Martin Rosvaine had gone into the production of motion pictures and Blayne
