PARTY GOING ( 255 pp. ) - Henry Green-Viking ( $3 ) . <P> On the literary stock exchange , the novels of England 's Henry Green rate well up among the blue chips . Readers of Loving , Nothing and Concluding collected dividends in wit and wisdom . Party Going , the sixth of Green 's eight slim novels to be published in the U.S. , proves that Green can put out penny stock , too . <P> Party Going is shy of plot , even for plot-shy Henry Green . Seven bright young crumbs from the British upper crust set out for a holiday in France ; they never get there . A dense fog anchors them to a London terminal-and four hours of each other 's clabbering company . The rich and amiable sponsor of the party , Max Adey , wangles hotel rooms to wait in , and they go for each other , hammers &; tongues . <P> One of the girls , Julia , is out to trip Max into matrimony when a recent flame named Amabel shows up with an older idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max frothing and fumbling . When the pair rejoins the others , Amabel looks " like a cat that has just had its own mouse coming among other cats who had only had the smell . " But Amabel 's triumph is short . When the fog lifts , the only kitten Max has eyes for is gentle Julia , who sports retractable claws . <P> In a sinister shadow play of symbols , Green tries to suggest that life is more than a kittenish spree . A pigeon falls dead on the first page ; Julia worries endlessly about not packing her good luck charms , " her egg with the elephants in it , her wooden pistol and her little painted top " ; a spindly mystery man gibbers in changing dialects about the grave illness of somebody 's stricken aunt . Like signposts in limbo , these point everywhere and nowhere . And Party Going 's old-fashioned pastime-noodling flea-brained upper-class Britons-is next door to limbo . Writing this novel in the ' 30s , Author Green wrapped the comedy of a lesser Waugh in the chatter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a satire with about as much yoke as a ping-pong ball .
