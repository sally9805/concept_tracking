WITH LOVE FROM GRACIE ( 335 pp. ) - Grace Megger Lewis-Harcoud , Brace ( $5.75 ) . <P> The sad point of Babbitt was not so much that Zenith 's leading realtor was a philistine , but that he half knew it and hankered vaguely after something more than the life of a rich land shark . <P> The sad point about Main Street was that Carol Kennicott knew that Gopher Prairie was full of philistines , but did not understand that Chanel No. 5 would never rout a gopher from its hole . <P> There was something of Babbitt in his creator , Sinclair Lewis , and there was something of Carol Kennicott in his first wife , Grace Hegger Lewis . Gracie was , Lewis once wrote , " all the good part of Carol . " This lends an uncommon interest to what would otherwise be a commonplace biography-Grace 's account of her years with " Hal . " <P> The facts of Lewis ' life are well known , but Gracie Lewis , now sixtyish , gives them an extra dimension of pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lost , once-loved husband . <P> Gracie Was a Lady . She met Harry Sinclair Lewis after he had come to Manhattan from his native Sauk Center , Minn. , via Yale . It happened in 1912 when young Hal-his friends called him " Red " for his thin , gingerish thatch-saw a lady across a tearoom . It was Grace Hegger , daughter of a Catholic German-American art dealer . She had golden hair , a job on Vogue , and she brought out the romantic in Hal , who wrote her some of the goofiest poetry boy ever wrote girl : <P> Princess , princess , silver maiden , Throw your casement open ; see- On the terrace I am singing ; Come and take the road with me ! <P> The princess did , and it was a long , rough road . But Gracie makes clear that young Hal 's romanticism persisted , and that it gave him a place from which he could see his own America with an out side eye . <P> Being a Famooser . The couple went to Sauk Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis turned his home town into Main Street , an overnight literary sensation . Lewis was then 35 , and Gracie thinks fame came too early . He and Gracie and their 3-year-old son Wells ( named for H.G. ) took ship for England and the captain of the Carmania asked them to sit at his table . " Jeezus ! " cried Lewis in the very accents of Main Street . " There 's something to this being a Famooser ! " <P> He met everyone from Osbert Sitwell to Lady Astor , and of course Wells met Wells . The British were eager to see in Main Street support for the comforting conviction that Americans , though rich , were a pretty uncouth lot . So Lewis was warmly received , but not all appreciated his japeries . When he met some prominent Irishmen , his notion of humor was to sing a funny song about Christ walking on the water . Lewis insisted on doing imitations at dinner , and they went on too long . He even fancied he resembled Bernard Shaw and bought a wig at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Shaw impersonation ( the older clown was not amused ) .
