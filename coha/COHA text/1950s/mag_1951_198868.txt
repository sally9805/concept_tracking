It sounded like just another Communist accusation . A U.N . night-flying plane , said the Reds , had " made machine-gunning " over the Kaesong neutral zone . Five U.N . colonels ( four U.S. , one South Korean ) were dispatched to investigate . This time , the Red charge proved to be true . <P> The U.N . officers were shown bullet holes in houses and bullet marks on masonry less than a mile from the conference house ( in which no truce talks had been held since Aug. 22 ) . Some flattened .50-cal. slugs were lying on the ground ; the Reds did not claim that any person had been hit . In addition to this evidence , U.N . officers had other proof - the record kept by their own radar operators . At about the time the Communists said the attack occurred , U.N . radar had spotted a plane over Kaesong . Investigation showed that it was a U.S. B-26 of the 3rd Bomb Group . The pilot 's story : he had fired on Kaesong , mistaking it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner Joy sent a formal apology to North Korea 's Nam Il : " The United Nations Command regrets this violation of the agreed neutrality . . . Appropriate disciplinary action is being initiated . . . " <P> The incident , while it will probably have little influence on the situation , weakens the U.N . ' s position , which is based on General Ridgway 's heated assertion that the past Red charges were phony . The candor with which the U.N . admitted the plane incident testified to its sincerity ; but some people could now argue that if one violation happened-by mistake-perhaps some of the other incidents the Reds cited had happened in the same way . The Peking radio crowed triumphantly , indicated that the Communists would resume the talks if the U.N . pleaded guilty to all the other charges , too . <P> Meanwhile , the Reds officially rejected General Ridgway 's proposal that the site of the cease-fire talks be changed . They branded it an attempt to " run away from your side 's responsibility for violation of the Kaesong neutrality agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communist leaders , Ridgway firmly repeated that , after thorough investigation , all the Red charges except the one apologized for had been found false . He added : " I again emphasize my concern in the achievement of a just and honorable military armistice ... I am still prepared to order my liaison officers to a meeting ... to discuss . . . resumption of the armistice talks . "
