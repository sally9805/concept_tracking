Dear Time-Reader <P> When TIME reported the appointment by President Eisenhower of the new Joint Chiefs of Staff ( May 25 ) , the story was headed " Brainier Board . " I was reminded , when I read it , of a TIME correspondent 's report on the Army 's training maneuvers held in Louisiana in September 1941 . Said the 1941 dispatch : <P> " It is refreshing to find an officer of whom everyone speaks highly , to whom is freely applied the Army 's commendation of a superior man : ' He 's the finest officer in the Army . ' During two weeks ' maneuvers I heard several so lauded . The one officer who probably was praised more highly than any other during the maneuvers was Colonel Dwight D. Eisenhower , 50-year-old Texan , a red-faced , trigger-brained officer who was made a brigadier general a day or two after the maneuvers had ended . . . Well-informed Army men predict that Eisenhower will be a major general within six months . <P> " Alfred M. Gruenther , 42 , was General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his right ) at the GHQ directors ' group at Camp Polk . Gruenther became a lieutenant colonel during the maneuvers . . . Eisenhower says Gruenther is one of the best soldiers he has ever known-and so do dozens of other people . Gruenther is a thin , pale , frank officer who proves to be studious , well-informed and extremely well-liked . . . The knowing element in the Army is betting on the Eisenhower-Gruenther combination to swim to the top quickly . " <P> By April 1942 , TIME was able to report that Eisenhower 's fellow officers were right in their assessment and prediction . He had been promoted to major general . About three months later he became a lieutenant general , and TIME commented : " Top commander of the A.E.F. is Lieut . General Dwight D. Eisenhower , 51 , whose promotion to the top ranks was one of the cheering signs that War Secretary Stimson and Chief of Staff Marshall had abandoned promotion by seniority , had long been digging deep in the Army files for the best men it had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a vintage year for finding the men with brains and ability to lead the U.S. and her allies to victory . And TIME 'S early background reports helped mark the young men who would be important in achieving that victory . Since the end of World War II , the importance of the nation 's military establishment has continued virtually undiminished , and the importance of thoughtful reporting on the military is as great as ever . With this in mind , I would like to quote briefly from a recent story speculating on possibilities for the new Joint Chiefs of Staff ( TIME , May 4 ) : <P> " Ever since the votes were counted last November , top Congressional Republicans have been arguing that Dwight Eisenhower should appoint a new team to replace the present U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff . . . Last week President Eisenhower privately assured his congressional leaders that he will name new chiefs . . . Scuttlebutt ranked the possible candidates this way :                  @ @ @
