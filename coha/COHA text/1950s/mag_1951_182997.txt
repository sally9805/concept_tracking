SINK ' EM ALL ( 416 pp. ) - Vice'Admiral Charles A. Lockwood-Dutton ( $5 ) . <P> <P> BATTLE SUBMERGED ( 244 pp. ) - Rear Admiral Harley Cope &; Cap fain Walter Karig-Norton ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> Before World War II , the biggest noise a U.S. submarine could make was by sinking unintentionally . In the Navy itself , the " Silent Service , " never pitted against a maritime power , was a freakish stepchild with neither battle experience nor fighting tradition. * A pampered stepchild , foreign submariners thought : the big air-conditioned subs were " luxury liners " ; ice cream and hot showers would turn the crew into " softies . " But U.S. subs had been designed for the war they would one day have to fight , and in grueling 60-day patrols into " The Empire , " i.e. , Japanese waters , the service abundantly proved its worth . U.S. subs were soon chewing up Japanese shipping at the rate of over 200,000 tons a month . The U.S. submariner turned out to be a calm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feats of the submariners are recounted in Battle Submerged , by Rear Admiral Harley Cope and Captain Walter Karig , and Sink ' Em All , by Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood . Unfortunately , each book spills some of the drama in the detail , but they make clear that the undersea arm now has handsome traditions of its own . Examples : the stories of the Barb , the Tang and the Growler . <P> Life Begins at 40 . The Barb 's skipper , Lieut . Commander Eugene Fluckey , knew that a fat Jap convoy had holed up in Namkwan Harbor on the China coast opposite Formosa . Gene Fluckey and his crew " cased the joint . " Going in , the Barb was going to have to take its chances with the enemy minefields ; going out , Fluckey figured he would slither through an area marked " rocks " and " unexplored " on his chart . That way , the Barb would be an hour 's run from safe diving depth , and it might make deep water if , as Fluckey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . Shortly after 3 a.m. the Barb went in . It was a submariner 's dream : some 30 ships lined up like pins in an alley . Eight torpedoes hit six of them , including two ammunition ships , and turned the harbor into " a wholesale fireworks display with the aurora borealis and a couple of sunsets to boot . " An hour later , Skipper Fluckey noted in his log : " Crossed the 20 fathom curve with a sigh ... However , life begins at 40 fathoms . " <P> The Tang 's favorite assignment was also " redirecting " Japanese shipping . But during a two-day air strike , Commander Richard Hetherington O'Kane and his men were given a new job : fishing downed airmen out of Truk 's big lagoon . The first day was relatively uneventful : only three saved in the teeth of enemy gunfire . On the second day , soon after dawn , the Tang picked up three airmen off fortified Ollan Island ; a little later , three more , seven miles to the east . Then a Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea too choppy to take off . The plane reached the Tang with eight more flyers , some straddled on the wings . All day the Tang ferried and fished . At dusk the last two dripping aviators were pulled aboard . Of 46 airmen who hit the water during the two days , 28 were rescued , 22 of them by the Tang .
