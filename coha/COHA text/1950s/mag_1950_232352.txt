NEW PRODUCTS Come Out of the Kitchen As the $50,000-a-year president of Chicago 's Cory Corp. , one of the biggest U.S. makers of glass coffee brewers , James William Alsdorf , 37 , considers himself his own best customer . He drinks 21 cups of coffee a day , all made in a Cory coffeemaker . One afternoon last week , Jim Alsdorf bubbled with excitement as he showed off another product which can be used after each cup is emptied . It is the " Cory Made Maid , " a 23-lb. electric dishwasher , compact enough to fit on the kitchen drainboard , cheap enough ( $89.95 ) to undersell most existing electric models by more than 50% . With it , chipper Jim Alsdorf cockily predicted that he would revolutionize the home-dishwasher market . <P> Alsdorf quit the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School of Finance and Commerce as a sophomore in 1933 , took a selling job with his father 's A. J. Alsdorf Corp. , one of Chicago 's oldest export businesses . Among their exports was the vacuum coffeemaker made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey Cory . Young Alsdorf did so well selling the coffeemaker in coffee-drenched Brazil that he began to think of what he could do with proper salesmanship in the U.S. In 1942 , when Founder Cory retired , Alsdorf and a group of friends scraped up enough money to buy control of the company . He added electric fans , stoves and air humidifiers to the Cory line , and in five years boosted sales from $2.5 million to a 1947 peak of $10.2 million-and profits from $151,500 to $1,200,000 . <P> Alsdorf picked up his dishwasher from California 's Applied Products Co. on a royalty deal ( a minimum of $20,000 a year plus $2 for each machine sold in excess of 10,000 ) . The machine , which has an adaptation of a powerful hydraulic pump previously used for cleaning airplane parts , needs no installation ; just plug it into a socket and hook it onto the kitchen faucet . <P> Last week , Alsdorf was stepping up production of his Matic Maid to reach 400 units a day by month 's end . To sell it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the woman . Says he : " Seventy-four percent* of the men in this country help their wives with the dishes . Now they can duck the job without feeling like heels . " <P> <P> *A private guess , based on the reading of women 's magazines .
