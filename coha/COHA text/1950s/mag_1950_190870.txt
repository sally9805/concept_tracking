BACKGROUND FOR WAR <P> Just ahead of the winter freeze-up , the broad-bottomed barges cast off from Nome 's weather-beaten docks and tagged southward behind their tugs toward the Bering Sea . Townsmen ashore watched the cargoes of Air Force trucks , black oil drums and crated airplane parts disappear into the blue distance . The Air Force was leaving Nome , lock , stock &; barrel . On the plains east of the city , Marks Air Force Base-once the hub of several satellite fields and home for 10.000 World War II troops-was deserted save for its housekeepers and the solitary comings &; goings of commercial airliners . The little ( pop . 1,852 ) Alaskan coastal city , just under 30 jet-driven minutes from Siberian fighter outposts , last week found herself 500 miles out in front of the new U.S. defensive position . <P> Nome had company in her shivery loneliness . All the way across the Aleutian chain , most of the old World War II air bases were deserted , their torn Quonsets flapping and creaking before the storms . South toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for air bases-the last detachments of troops had been moved out of Ketchikan and Sitka , and out of Juneau , the capital of the territory . Under the armed forces ' new strategy for defending Alaska , the U.S. was coiling its strength-its winterized jet fighters , its cadres of weather-wise pilots and its supporting Army troops-into one tight defense net in the Alaskan heart . <P> Road Fed &; Ice Free . The heartland is a 500-mile-long loop of sea , plain and jagged mountain , notable because-in Alaska 's trackless central land mass-it is stitched together by year-round transportation . It begins in the southwest at the island naval base of Kodiak , encompasses the ice-free ports of Seward and Whittier , fans up along the 471-mile Alaska Railroad , and there hooks on to the Alaska ( Alcan ) Highway , last segment of the 2,350-mile overland route from the U.S. <P> Here , and only here , the Joint Chiefs of Staff had decided , could the U.S. build a base that 1 ) could be supplied through the paralyzing winters , 2 ) would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be central enough to defend Alaska against attack . In any future world war , Alaska would be a prize in transpolar air warfare . Here the U.S. would first intercept Russian planes curving eastward out of the Chukotsk bases ( where the Soviets have been building up fuel supplies ) , bound for such atom-worthy targets as the Hanford plutonium plant in eastern Washington , or the West Coast aircraft plants-or possibly industrial targets in the upper Midwest . Offensively , Alaska was a strategic refueling point for transpolar B-36s . <P> Non-Global War . Why , then , was the U.S. falling back to Alaska 's inner core ? It had been different in World War II . The Japanese , landing on Attu and Kiska , had tied up ten U.S. divisions . The Navy , hard-pressed at the crucial battle of Midway , had nonetheless spared five cruisers , 13 destroyers and six submarines to defend the big peninsula against a diversionary raid . Air bases were strewn along the coast and down the Aleutians at enormous cost : in 1942 the Army diverted desert-camouflaged planes intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now closing out bases .
