American composers have never been so busy . The Louisville Orchestra and the Boston Symphony between them are lavishly commissioning new works . Latest patron : Manhattan 's Juilliard School of Music , which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a " Festival of American Music . " This month and in April Juilliard will perform 35 brand-new compositions , all but three of them commissioned by the school . The festival , says Juilliard 's President William Schuman , " reaffirms the school 's sense of responsibility toward the music of its own time . " Last week the festival opened in Juilliard 's University Heights auditorium , 65 blocks north of Carnegie Hall ; the concert suggested nevertheless that modern American music is no longer as out-of-the-way as it used to be . <P> Led with precision and enthusiasm by Conductor Jean Morel , the Juilliard student orchestra began with an eclectic taradiddle called a " Preamble " by Manhattan Composer Bernard Wagenaar , then settled down to serious business : Composer Roger Sessions ' Concerto for Pianoforte and Orchestra . It was the second Sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a symphony and a Mass still to come this spring . Played brilliantly by Pianist Beveridge Webster , the score , to tradition-attuned listeners , was like being sprayed with salvos of molten metal and broken glass . But the salvos were always tightly under control , and the fragments landed in a precise , intricate pattern . The concerto moved in a strong , surging series of climaxes , without concession to showiness or chic . For all its uncompromising musical headwork , Sessions ' concerto had a lyric calm that pervaded even the lightning shifts and stabbings of the fast passages . <P> Third composition on the program was Peter Mennin 's Concerto for Violoncello and Orchestra , which made fewer demands on the listener , and showed less originality and toughness . It provided a neoromantic contrast to Sessions , and for long stretches sounded as if it might have been titled " Mr. Brahms Goes to Juilliard . " Composer Mennin , who has six performed symphonies to his credit , kept the orchestra mostly under wraps to make his concerto one long melodious song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the festival program furnish a virtual Who 's Who in American Music , including Composers Walter Piston and Roy Harris , Aaron Copland , Paul Creston , Wallingford Riegger , Henry Cowell , Norman Dello Joio.
