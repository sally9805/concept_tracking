Murdo Ewen Macdonald remembers his first West of Scotland congregation-on the Isle of Skye-as " very churched people . The acids of the modern temper have n't corroded them much . " <P> Last week Presbyterian Macdonald , 36 , now pastor of Edinburgh 's St. George 's West Church , told Americans how to clean up the kind of corrosion he has found outside the Isle of Skye . To a big midsummer congregation in Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church and to students at Union Theological Seminary , he gave the same message : " The thing wrong with religion today the world over , and especially in America , is that it is too centrally heated , too cozy and comfortable . " His remedy : less social psychology and good fellowship , more emphasis on an austere gospel of sacrifice . Said Macdonald : <P> " Christian evangelism will never make an impact until it regains the genius of the Cross , the capacity for sacrifice . Look what the Communists have required of just ordinary people . . . Religion today does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Macdonald learned the worth of sacrifice in a hard school . In 1942 , after two years as a British army chaplain , he switched to combat duty with the paratroopers . A bit later , while commanding a platoon in North Africa , he was taken prisoner . Until the end of the war , he ministered to fellow prisoners , mostly U.S. airmen , in a Luftwaffe camp . " The war , " he said , " taught us the indescribable latent courage of the ordinary person . " <P> This spiritual courage can only be evoked by a strong spiritual message . Although Macdonald greatly admires the informal relations which often exist between U.S. ministers and their congregations ( " Perhaps we in Britain are more formal " ) , he doubts that good fellowship and social consciousness can be substituted for active Christianity . <P> " We must preach a social gospel , but we must first of all preach the Word . . . To call the wrath of God a metaphor , to smoothly rationalize Hell , to smother the Cross in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a religion left , but it is not the religion of the New Testament .
