The Senate 's Small Business Committee , a restive watchdog , last week barked at big business . Charged the committee : ten large manufacturing companies * have received 40% of the $22 billion worth of defense contracts awarded since Korea . By hogging defense contracts , said the committee , big corporations have choked off supplies of critical materials to small companies , which can neither carry on civilian production nor get defense work . <P> If the committee had looked more closely at arms production it might have held its scolding tongue . Big companies get the bulk of prime contracts because they alone have the facilities to turn out such big items as bombers , ship generators and half-tracks . But they subcontract their orders to thousands of small businessmen . Examples : Lockheed Aircraft Corp . has signed up 4,000 firms , of which 2,835 are small businesses ( fewer than 500 workers ) ; General Motors Corp . ' s normal list of 12,500 suppliers will soon be swelled to 19,000 by subcontracting . <P> Even in prime contract work , small businessmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on letting contracts for heavy " hardware " and started ordering many less complicated items , the small business share of prime contracts has jumped from 21% to 28% . <P> <P> * The committee 's top ten as of June 1 : General Motors Corp. , $3.5 billion in defense contracts ; Ford Motor Co. , $1 billion ; Boeing Airplane Co. , $960 million ; Curtiss-Wright Corp. , $840 million ; Lockheed Aircraft Corp. , $674 million ; Republic Aviation Corp. , $549 million ; General Electric Co. , $500 million ; United Aircraft Corp. , $490 million ; North American Aviation , $481 million ; Bendix Aviation Corp. , $475 million .
