The surviving remnant of the great race of whooping cranes , hardly more than two dozen birds , will be " escorted " this fall from Canada to Texas . That is , they will be escorted insofar as it is possible for human beings to escort wild creatures which fly high and come to rest in lonely places . But , elusive though they may be , these huge white birds with the black wingtips will be followed on their route by thousands of well-wishers. // In advance of their coming a campaign is being conducted to alert the human population along the migration route of the cranes . As was the case last fall , radio stations will broadcast appeals to report the birds but not molest them . Their trip will be announced by newspapers . Sportsmen 's clubs and civic organizations have helped spread the word . Thousands of post cards bearing the facts and a picture of a whooper have been mailed to persons living along the flight lane . // All this is part of the international effort to help America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 ARE LEFT // When the birds migrated last spring there were 26 whooping cranes left  --  in the entire population of the species . Grus americana does n't occur in other parts of the world and they have been studied so thoroughly that the chance of even a single bird being discovered outside this group is highly improbable . // Two of the cranes , found crippled by gunshot , are now captives in a New Orleans zoo . The rest winter on the wide marshes and prairies of the 47,000-acre Arkansas Federal Wildlife Refuge on the Texas coast , 40 miles from Corpus Christi . There they live singly and in family groups , each family occupying a territory of some 500 acres from which other cranes are driven . Without the use of a blind it is difficult to get within half a mile of them . On a trip to the refuge I jeeped and stalked the prairies for days before I got a close view of the cranes . When a pair finally flew right over me I was told that I was luckier than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining whoopers has not been found . This summer a scientist hovering in a helicopter over the wild country south of Canada 's Great Slave Lake looked down and spotted four whooping cranes , three adults and a young one . His find was the best evidence so far of the general location of their breeding grounds . // The whooping crane once inhabited the central part of the continent from the Arctic Coast to central Mexico . It demanded plenty of space in which to live and rear its young , and when it stood at full height to utter its challenging buglelike call , it was almost six feet tall . But as the prairies were tamed and planted , the whooping cranes dwindled steadily . // A PROJECT FOR SALVATION // Now the Fish and Wildlife Service , the Canadian Wildlife Service and the National Audubon Society are partners in a project designed to save the whooping crane from extinction . Numerous state agencies and private groups are cooperating . One of the prime workers on the project is Robert P. Allen , research ornithologist of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensive study of the cranes , hoping to find a way to halt their decline . // During that time he lived with the birds on the lonely Texas marshes in winter . In early spring he took off by plane in advance of their migration and intercepted them along the Platte River in Nebraska . He traced their migration route through Texas , Oklahoma , Kansas , Nebraska , the Dakotas and into Saskatchewan where they disappeared into Canada 's north country . He flew thousands of miles in the far north in a vain search for their nesting grounds . // People often ask how on earth the cranes know enough to go right to the refuge to spend the winter . The answer is that the presence of the whooping cranes there is historic and was one of the main reasons why the refuge was established in 1937. // As a result of Allen 's recommendations , numerous steps have been taken to aid the cranes . One of the main objectives has been to find the nesting grounds and learn whether there are any factors there which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nesting area is found it will be declared an inviolate sanctuary . Plans are now being made for a systematic search of the area next summer . // Each fall the refuge men are waiting eagerly as the cranes come back in little groups . By early December they are all in and the refuge men make an exact count by flying over them in small planes . In recent years the flock has returned with an average of four young birds . But usually a few of the parents are lost , some from being shot , and others from unknown causes . Sometimes the population fluctuates perilously . The gain or loss of a single bird is vital to the survival of the race . // Last year there was a gain . Twenty-one whoopers took off for the North in the spring and in the fall all 21 returned , bringing three gawky offspring with them . This fall more eyes than ever will be on the alert in the country 's most unusual bird-watching program .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
