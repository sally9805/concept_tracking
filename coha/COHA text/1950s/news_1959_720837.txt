txt In a smarting reaction to being relieved today of his command in East Boston , Police Capt . Patrick J. O'Reilly has challenged United States Internal Revenue agents to prove that a $26 , - 000,000 gambling operation was going on across the street from his Station No. 7 . " That figure , " replies Frank J. Cavanagh , Massachusetts District Director of IRS. " did not originate in the Internal Revenue Service or with any employee of it . " We know that we picked up over ** in 27 minutes in East Boston . If some people other than IRS officials projected the figure over an annual period , that is a matter over which we could not exercise control . " He did not comment on the estimates by Fred G. Pastore , IRS intelligence division group supervisor . that the East Boston quarters , raided Oct. 30 by his men , conducted a $500,000-a-week operation . Mr. Cavanagh says it will take three to five weeks for his men to analyze the quantity of material seized in the two raids conducted since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his office will have no further comment . The 13 men seized Oct. 30 appeared before United States Commissioner Peter J. Nelligan yesterday and secured a postponement of their hearing until Dec. 9 . Police Commissioner Leo J. Sullivan yesterday announced Captain O'Reilly would be returned this morning to the department 's Bureau of Criminal Investigation and that he would be replaced in East Boston by Capt . John J. Slattery , Jr . Captain O'Reilly 's stinging response came at 3 a.m. today when he called newsmen and deMM. dared that a ** bookmaking ring in his division was preposterous . He said , " If they can show any evidence that Burke 's , Inc. , ( object of the second T-man raid ) was linked to any booking operation , I 'll resign from the force today . " He charged that such a sprawling gambling operation could not possibly operate from such a small headquarters as Chick 's Bargain Shoe Store . " 1 have been embarrassed and ridiculed in the press as either corrupt or stupid , " declared Capt . O'Reilly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisor of the Internal Revenue Service who led the raid to back up his statements . . . . " I have been transferred from my division as division commander to the BCI under a cloud and I feel it is my obligation and duty to my family to place This matter before the public . . . " " When this thing is all over , " he added , " there are going to be a lot of red faces but not in Division 7 . " In addition to Captain O'Reilly 's transfer , seven sergeants and four detectives have been moved from Station 7 to other divisions . All transfers were effective early this morning , Nov. 5 . Asked at his press conference yesterday why no demotions resulted from the East Boston situation , Commissioner Sullivan replied that transferring his men is the only disciplinary course open to him . They are civil service employees , he says , and can not be removed unless it is proved that they actually knew that a bookmaking operation was in progress .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
