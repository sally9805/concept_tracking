txt Harold R. Fetzer , Kansas Attorney General , filed suit here today to recover $110,000 from a. fraternal insurante company that sold a tuberculosis sanitarium to the state and paid an 11,000 fee to C. Wesley Roberts , the present chairman of the Republican National Committee , for his part in negotiating the sale two years ago . Mr. Fatzer , a Republican , ruled that the building , erected in 1928 on state property near Norton , Kan. , always had belonged to the state and not to the Ancient Order of the United Workmen of Kansas , which was named as defendant in the recovery action filed in the Shawnee County District Court . While Mr. Fatzer 's suit did not name Mr. Roberts , the action is , expected to have national repercussions because of its bearing upon the activities of Mr , Roberts as a public relations consultant before he assumed the chairmanship of the Republican party following the election of President Eisenhower , who is pledged to end influence peddling . There have been demands in the Kansas press for the removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's expression of confidence in him . Legislators Holding Inquiry The State Attorney General announced his ruling on state ownership of the sanitarium and his in tention to file the suit to recover the purchase price before a joint committee of the Kansas Legislature that has been investigating the deal and Mr. Roberts ' . participation in it for about ten days . The committee , which already has heard Mr. Roberts ' defense of his right to the fee as a public relations consultant and his denial of any lobbying or other wrongdoing , is scheduled to end its hearings late this week , and to file its report with the . Legislature by next Wednesday . A representative of the insurance company welcomed the suit as an opportunity to prove in the courts what it contends are its legal title to the building and the propriety of the sale to the state . Harry W. Colmery , attorney for the A. 0 . U. W. and former National Commander of the American Legion , said it should have been apparent to the Attorney General that property rights could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to litigate it , I say ' swell , ' " said Mr. Colmery to Mr. Fatzer before the committee , " but // you will find a lot of obstacles in your way . " The legislative investigation has deeply stirred Kansas and has produced angry debate across the state over the propriety of Mr. Roberts ' actions . So far , the fight has been largely among Republicans in this state where that party is dominant . The Democrats , for the most part , have stayed on the sidelines hopeful that the split will help to bring their party to power in the next elections . Gov . Edward F. Arn , who approved state purchase of the building , has defended Mr. Roberts before the investigating committee and has placed the blame for the inquiry upon a " grudge " held against Mr. Roberts by Alvin McCoy , the Kansas correspondent of The Kansas City Star . Reply Expected Today It was Mr. McCoy who first brought to public attention the payment of a fee by the insurance company to Mr. Roberts . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertions that he " distorted and slanted news stories to attack Mr. Roberts . " Governor Arn originally was elected with the support of The Star , which has wide political influence in this state , and his attack upon Mr. McCoy has raised the question whether the Arn group of the Republican party now has broken with that newspaper . The Star thus far has offered no editorial comment on the legislative inquiry or on the Governor 's attack Upon its Kansas correspondent . Before filing his suit today , Mr. Fatzer told the legislative committee that he believed only the courts could determine the title to the tuberculosis sanitarium . He said he had not decided to bring the action until the committee had heard all the pertinent evidence on ' ownership of the building . Mr. Fetzer has been participating in the inquiry and questioning wit- , nesses . At issue , in the legislative inquiry and the law suit filed today , is a contract between the state and the fraternal insurance company entered into on Jan. 17. 1928 . It provided that the company would build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state would give first priority in housing and treating to members of the insurance company . $1 a Day a Patient Paid The insurance company paid $1 a day for the care of its members . and the state was allowed to use any unoccupied beds for the care of state patients . Testimony before the committee has brought out that there was an understanding between officials of the insurance company and the state that the building would become the property of the state if and when the insurance company abandoned its interest in the building . In accordance with this agreement , the company constructed at a cost of $51,712 a twenty-eightbed hospital in 1928 and four years later added an eight-bed extension at a cost of $14,500 . Insurance company officialsee-said. that over the period of twentythree years , the company spent an additional $58,000 on maintenance and upkeep , making a total investment of $124,000 . The insurance company financed this benefit for its members by an assessment of five cents a member a month on the 12,000 members in this state . Over a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitarium fluctuated from as high as eighteen to twenty at one time , down to two patients at the end of December , 1950 . Although under the 1928 agreement the state charged the insurance company $1 a day for the care of its members , testimony be-1 fore the investigating committee , brought out that this treatment cost the state more than $7 a day.I In the suit filed today , the At-1 torney General asserted that the original contract of 1928 was ' signed by officials of the A.O.U.W.1 but " was not signed by any official of the State of Kansas other than , the attorney general . " The agreee ment introduced into evidence contained a blank space above the place meant for the signature of the vice chairman of the State Board of Administration . Whether signed or not , Mr. Fatzer 's suit contended , the agreement ' was void and without legal effect " because neither the State Board of Administration nor any officer or agent of the State of Kansas had legal authority to enter into such understanding or arrangement . " Privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers or agents had any I right or authority to grant to the Ancient Order of United Workmen or its members as a class the privilege of using public land as a private benefit where such benefit does not accrue to the general public . " the petition said . " Such action is in violation of ! Section 2 of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the State of Kansas which provides that all ' free governments are founded on the authority of the people and are instituted for their equal protection and benefit . " The Attorney General also asserted that there was no written agreement that the title to the building " would not follow the title ' to the land on which it was constructed . " Title to the building was at all time in the State of Kansas , according to the petition . In the only paragraph bearing directly upon Mr. Roberts ' activities , the Attorney General 's petition said : " In or about the beginning of the year 1951 , and during the months of January and February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives that the State of Kansas purchase the building . That pursuant to such solicitation , the State Board of Social Welfare sought and obtained an appropriation from the 1951 Legislature of the State of Kansas in the amount of $110,000 with which to purchase the building . * 4 The State of Kansas paid to the defendant the sum of $110,000 for the building and title thereto . " Mr. Fatzer 's suit asked recovery of the full sum voted by the Legs-. lature plus 6 per cent interest since July 6 , 1951 , the date on which title was passed . Mr. Roberts has testified that he was approached by the officials of the insurance company in late 1950 or early 1951 , He has testified that he was at that time a public relations consultant , but that he did not have an office , except at his residence in Holton , Kan. , nor did he have a secretary or business stationery . He emphasized that at the time of his employment by the insurance company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had retired in August , 1950 , as state chairman , and in the fall of that year had managed the successful Senatorial campaign of Senator Frank Carlson . Governor Arn testified on Monday that when he had recommend .. ed Mr. Roberts to an official of the Cities Service Gas Company when that company was seeking a representative in Topeka to keep it informed on the progress of legislation during the 1951 session of the Legislature , Mr. Roberts got the job and received $3,750 for his services , which , he emphasized , did not include " lobbying " activities . There has been no testimony before the investigating committee that Mr. Roberts at any time ' lobbied " with members of the Legislature to influence them for or against legislation affecting either the Cities Service Company or the purchase of the A. 0 . U. W. building . There has been agreement , in ! the testimony that the one legisIlator approached by Mr. Roberts ! concerning sale of the insurance company building was Chris Green , ' a Republican State Senator , but i at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both have agreed that Mr. Roberts simply asked the procedure for obtaining consideration by the committee obtaining any proposition submitted by state officials for the purchase of the sanitarium . Senator Green was a witness before the committee today and said that Mr. Roberts had not disclosed Ito him that he was a paid representative of the insurance company . " I thought he Mr. Roberts was representing the state , " said Mr. ! Green . " Did you still think of him as state chairman of the Republican party ? " the Senator was asked . " Sure , " Senator Green responded . Was Approved Unanimously It was Mr. Green who presented the proposition to buy the building to the committee , which approved it unanimously . The bill subsequently passed the House and Senate without dissent . Asked if he would have favored the bill if he had known that Mr. , Roberts was to receive $11,000 , Mr. Green said that he would have been " absolutely against it . " The testimony has brought out that Mr. Roberts , acting for the insurance company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-fold proposition . The insurance company , he said , might be willing to sell its building for a fair price thatcould be fixed by appraisal of the State Architect , and that the company could take or leave it . If the building were not to be sold , it was testified , the insurance company had in mind continuing Mr , Roberts as its public relations counsel to publicize a program to sell more insurance for the treatment of patients . Officials of the State Welfare Board were warned that the insurance company might exercise its rights to occupy all of the thirty-six beds in the building at Norton , with the state paying , for all care and treatment over and above $1 a day and being forced to move patients already in the building . Dual Responsibility Cited State officials were told that if insurance company patients occupied all the beds , and reimbursed the state only $1 a day , the possible cost to the state might be $75,000 annually , for an indefinite period of years . Testimony disclosed that state officials had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual responsibility for patients at the Norton Hospital , " and as long ago as 1945 , the Ways and Means Committee had recommended purchase of the building for $15,000 . This amount was rejected by the insurance company . After several conferences with Mr. Roberts and other A. 0 . U. W. officials , the State Board of Welfare decided to buy the building if agreement could be reached on the price . Charles Marshall , the state architect , gave several estimates that averaged $110,000 , and Mr. Roberts was asked to communicate this figure to the insurance . company . The company promptly s.ereed to this amount . It was at this stage that the State Board of Welfare notified the Ways and Means Committee in writing of its desire to purchase the building . Mr. Green , as chairman , put the measure before his committee after con.fening with Governor Arn and getting Ms approval of the appropriation as " an Administration measure , " Mr. Roberts has insisted that in ' his dealings with the welfare board , and with the Governor , he was neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
