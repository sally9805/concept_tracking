txt The Soviet Union and , China opened diplo. matic negotiations designed to broaden military and economic collaboration of ' these two great powers today . Observers felt certain the discussions would closely review the question of peace both in Europe and the Far East with a view to achieving the closest identity of positions for both China and the Soviet ' Union in the light of any eventualities . The chief discussions , in the meetings were expected to be conducted by Foreign Minister Chou En-lai with Deputy Premiers Vyacheslav Molotov and Anastas L Mikoyan and Marshal Nikolai A. Bulganin , all members of the Politburo , while staffs of both sides work out the details of collabora ? tion , technical assistance and re ? ' Iated topics . Generalissimo Stalin was expected , to give the confer ' ences his closest attention . Korean War No. 1 Topic The general outline of the Chinese-Russian dicussions as ' envisaged by diplomats in Moscow was expected to embrace the following questions : I. Possible eventualities in connection with the Korean war including the possibility of its extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an agreement . 2 . The general question of SovietChinese relationships in the Far East in the light of Japan 's peace treaty with the Western Powers and moves that might be made by the two Communist Powers toward regularizing rations ' with Japan . 3 . Questions of possible threats to the peace arising in Southeast Asia and the subject of the relations of the two Powers with India . 4 . Questions of future developments in Europe and possible threats to the peace in that area , particularly as regards Germany . 5 . Expanding the program of China 's broad scale industrialization and particularly the question of broadening the economic and technical assistance now being given China by the Soviet Union . 6 . Details with respect to the turning over to China of the Changchun railroad and Port Arthur , which is required to be completed this year under the agreements of the 1950 treaty . Present Treaty Covets Far East The most important aspect of the talks , in the opinion of the Moscow diplomats , was a review by the two Powers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two countries . The present Chinese-Russian treaty of alliance is , for all practical purposes , confined to the Far East and is aimed specifically at ' the possibility of a resurgence of Japanese militarism . The 1950 treaty calls for each power to go to the aid of the other lin the event of an attack by Japan or a nation allied with span . The treaty vas concluded in conditions that envisaged the early signing of a general Japanese peace treaty by all the powers in the war against Japan . Since these conditions did not eventuate  --  the Soviet Union and Communist . China did not sign the San Francisco pact ? it was assumed that both countries might find it useful to re-examine . the question of collaboration under present world conditions . The Chinese-Russian treaty , for example . was signed almost a halfyear before the outbreak of the Korean war at a time when , although threatening , conditions in the Far East were generally peaceful . Furthermore , it was noted by diplomats , that the present treaty is aimed at the Far Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points at which peace might be threatened and which are not covered by its terms . The Soviet has repeatedly characterized the situation in Germany as the chief threat to world peace at the present time and it was thought not illogical that both countries might wish to study their commitments in the light of possible eventualities in Europe as well as in Asia . Nuch Depends an Red Analysis *. ich , it was felt , depended upon the general world outlook as analyzed by the Soviet and Chinese leaders . If both felt that what they choose to call threats to the peace have not been reduced in recent times , but , on the contrary ; have increased , they would naturally be eager to take steps designed to meet all possibilities . One of the thorniest problems . ' facing the negotiators is that of the Korean war . It would come as Inc ) surprise to diplomats here if the Soviet-Chinese approach to this question gave an indication of what can be expected from both ' in the event extension ' of the conflict to China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation of a whole group of high representatives of different ( left of China 's armed forces Ileft little doubt that many specific land detailed military questions would be up for discussion . China has taken great steps to reorganize and strengthen her defense capabilities in the past two years . There was no doubt , that the Chinese and Russian defense chiefs would have long and intimate talks . On the economic side it was recalled that at present the Soviet Union is providing China with equipment under a five-year $300 , - 000,000 agreement arranged two years ago . It is certain that China 's needs have broadly expanded since that time and it is expected they will be carefully reviewed particularly in the light of the general contraction of trade between East and West that has occurred in the past two years . Russia and China are interested in a general expansion of world trade as well as in its augmentation between themselves . Soviet technical assistance to China thus far has mainly been concentrated in such fields as oil development , air transport and other specialties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
