Everywhere Bandleader Ray Anthony plays these days , dance halls develop a tremor under the thud of teen-age feet . The reason : a vigorous new conga-style dance number called The Bunny Hop , in which every verse ends with " Hop ! Hop ! Hop ! " For Anthony , it all started last spring , when he heard that the Coke set of San Francisco 's Balboa High School had worked up the dance . Anthony contrived a tuneless tune , recorded it ( for Capitol ) , ordered a batch of fuzzy bunny ears to give a touch of costume and started plugging song &; dance across the U.S. In cooperation with parents , who regard the dance as relatively sedate , if energetic , disk jockeys and Capitol press-agents have built The Bunny Hop into a minor teen-age mania . <P> Other new pop records : <P> Lyrics by Ira Gershwin ( Nancy Walker , Louise Carlyle , David Craig ; Walden LP ) . A fetching collection of ten off-beat tunes with lyrics ranging from innocence to sophistication . Only three are by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke , Kurt Weill , Aaron Copland , Jerome Kern , Arthur Schwartz . <P> Old Curiosity Shop ( Victor LP ) . Stagy old recordings , dating from 1911 to 1929 , that should bring mist to many an eye . Among the performers : Maurice Chevalier ( Valentine ) , Helen ( " boo-boop-a-doop " ) Kane ( I Have to Have You ) , Marlene Dietrich ( Falling in Love Again ) , Fanny Brice ( My Man ) , Gloria Swanson ( Love ) . Added features : monologues by Will Rogers , De Wolf Hopper and John Barrymore . <P> Broadway 's Best ( Jo Stafford ; Columbia LP ) . Several of these eight songs deserve to be ranked with the " best , " e.g. , Embraceable You , Night and Day , Come Rain or Come Shine , but not even Jo 's pretty voice is appealing enough to survive the grief-stricken tempos . <P> City of Glass ( Stan Kenton ; Capitol LP ) . Somebody obviously threw a stone at this musical city ; it is full of prismatic rubble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the best of Kenton 's symphonic experiments , frequently stimulating ( some of them closely related to such modern symphonists as Roger Sessions ) , and played with a virtuosity that a symphony orchestra might envy . <P> I Went to Your Wedding ( Spike Jones ; Victor ) . Spike lowers the boom on this one , and about time , with an outrageous vocal by " Sir Fredric Gas . " Fun for a while .
