Pierre Mends-France talked the language of action , used such expressions as " original , " " daring , " " the need for a psychological shock . " " You must choose , " was his challenge to the Assembly . His fellow Radical Socialist Edgar Faure talks the language of moderation and gradualism , speaks of " carom shots , " and " economic billiards . " " If you ca n't get over an obstacle , go around it , " he likes to say . Last week the French Assembly chose to go around with Faure . <P> For three weeks , as French movie audiences cheered pictures of Mends and booed the procession of Old Guard leaders to the presidential palace , France 's ship of state had been in irons-sails thrashing , the crew in shouting confusion . Night after night , old President Ren Coty had climbed from his bed to confer with pouchy-eyed politicians , while ample Madame Coty padded about the palace kitchen in her silken peignoir , serving endless cups of coffee . <P> Faure was the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party leaders themselves finally agreed was the best hope . " He is the exact middle , " explained Elder Statesman Paul Reynaud . Shrewdly , the Assembly 's old cuties had calculated that Faure was young enough , dynamic enough , and leftist enough to cut the ground from under Mends with the voters . " His dialogue is left , his politics right . This is a very useful arrangement , " said one supporter . <P> The Juggler . But even Faure almost failed before he succeeded . His first move was to consult his old friend Mends-France . Mends had kept Faure on as Finance Minister after the fall of the Laniel " richman 's government , " until Mends could turn his personal attention to reform of the creaking French economy . More than any man , Faure is credited with France 's relative prosperity of the past year and a half . But even before Mends ' fall , there had been friction between Mends and his more conservative Finance Minister . Now Mends flatly refused him support unless Faure would " remake our old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialists for a left-center coalition . Dutifully , Faure tried . But the Socialists , eager to campaign for higher wages in the 1956 elections without the embarrassment of having participated in a government that kept the lid on , refused him . Faure turned to the conservatives for his majority , and Mends turned openly hostile .
