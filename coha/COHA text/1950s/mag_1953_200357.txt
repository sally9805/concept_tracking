How much of an increase in world production is needed to raise the backward nations to a minimum standard of decent living ? The world needs at least another $25 billion worth of food a year and another $15 to $25 billion in housing , medicine , clothing , etc. , - an increase of 7% to 10% in present world production of consumer goods and services . This is the estimate of Economists Wladimir and Emma Woytinsky , a husband &; wife team who have spent five years compiling an exhaustive ( 1,268 pages ) study , World Population and Production , published by the Twentieth Century Fund . <P> To achieve the necessary increase , the world will need to produce more than four times as much energy by the end of this century as it does now . The demand for more energy is already being felt in backward countries , where the U.S. and Western Europe , by exporting capital and know-how , are setting up a " spiral of industrialization " which will mechanize underdeveloped areas . Say the Woytinskys : " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grinding grain and making flour at home . " <P> The quadrupled energy requirements are based on an estimated population increase from 2.4 billion at the half-century to 3.3 billion 50 years hence , and on a " conservative " increase in per capita energy needs of 2.5% a year . Thus , if our sources of energy are used twice as efficiently by the century 's end , we will still need twice as many sources . <P> Where will all the needed energy come from ? Surprisingly enough , the Woytinskys estimate that four-fifths will be obtained just the way it is now-from coal , oil , gas , water , wood and work animals-and only one-fifth from such new sources as the sun , the wind and the atom ( see chart ) . While petroleum consumption " is certain to rise from decade to decade , " there may be a worldwide shortage by the end of the century . Coal , on the other hand , sometimes regarded as a dying industry , is in for a big boost in the coming decades . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid and gaseous form from the earth 's crust will probably . . . approach its completion by the end of this century . The era of coal , which began 150 years earlier , is likely to continue longer and leave a deeper impact on mankind . " <P> The Woytinskys are unenthusiastic about the immediate prospects for atomic energy , point out that for several decades , more energy will go into building atomic piles than the plants will release . Eventually , however , some time after the year 2000 , man will stop picking " crumbs of energy " from the soil and move toward " deliberate control over the energy in his environment .
