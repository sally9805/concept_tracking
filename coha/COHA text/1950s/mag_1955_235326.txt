The scientific courts judging the Salk polio vaccine have had an exasperating way of reversing themselves . Now it 's safe , now it is n't . Now it works , now it does n't quite . In Kansas City last week , 6,000 members of the American Public Health Association listened to further testimony on how effective the Salk vaccine proved itself in last summer 's mismanaged mass inoculations . <P> The verdict was that the vaccine was generally safe and effective . Normally cautious Epidemiologist Alexander Langmuir of the U.S. Public Health Service reported , on the basis of returns from eleven states plus New York City , that the vaccine had been 75% effective , or better , in preventing paralytic polio among children in the five-to-nine age group , even though many had received only one or two inoculations instead of the desired three . <P> <P> New York State ( outside the city ) , with a massive 450,000 children inoculated , had telling figures : the paralytic-polio rate among the unvaccinated was 21 per 100,000 , but only four per 100,000 among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only about 3 to 2 , but final returns were expected to show that the disease had been milder , on the average , in vaccinated children . Chicago was unofficially reported to have had only two cases of paralytic polio per 100,000 among the vaccinated , as compared with 32 among the unvaccinated . <P> Eastern Mystery . Dr. Langmuir was forthright in listing cases where something went wrong . Among those who got vaccine made by California 's Cutter Laboratories , 79 developed polio ; so did 105 members of their families and 20 " com community contacts . " Three-fourths of the cases were paralytic ; there were eleven deaths . Vaccine from a second manufacturer , Pennsylvania 's Wyeth Laboratories , was suspected of responsibility for an unstated number of polio cases in the East , but the most rigorous testing by the federal Division of Biologic Standards failed to demonstrate live virus . These cases remained a disguieting mystery . <P> The PHS 's Surgeon General Dr. Leonard Scheele then read a report by his technical committee on the most recent steps to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Scheele , in " the degree of clarity of the different fluids " from which the various manufacturers have prepared vaccine . After the virus is grown in a broth of monkey-kidney tissue and left standing , a sediment may appear at the bottom of the flasks . The sediment is like lumps in porridge . When formaldehyde is added to kill the virus , it can not reach the particles in the middle of the lumps , thus leaving them dangerously infective . <P> In some cases , said Scheele , manufacturers had left virus cultures lying around for months and had failed to filter them before adding formaldehyde . Why this was permitted he did not say . Now , filtering must be done within 72 hours before the virus is killed and with the finest of glass filters .
