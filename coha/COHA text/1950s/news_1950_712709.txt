txt In a speech delivered at Alexandria yesterday against the background of Washington 's birthday observance , President Tillman summarized again the fundamental principles and aim of our foreign policy . The principles , he declared , are those of the free anti democratic ? society for which Washington fought a society which believes in self-government and a bill of rights . The aim , ' he said , is to defend that world against the attack of an armed imperialism which uses communism as an instrument and to develop that world so it ; can fulfill its great promise in peace ' and security . In his address Mr. Truman answered both the isolationists who would use Washington as the patron saint of their isolationism , and the Communists who would profane the revolution he led into a justification of their own revolutionary conspiracy . To the isolationists Mr. Truman pointed out that as a result of scientific progress , and in contrast to Washington 's time , the nations of the world , have been drawn together into a compion destiny , and that our . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before to the advance of freedom . and self-government in other lands . To the Communists and their sympathizers he pointed out that Washington led his people in a revolution against tyranny and for freedom , not for the establishment of an even greater tyranny and the suppression of liberty . At least by implication , the President also replied to critics wifo describe our foreign policy as negative because of our refusal to make new overtures at this time to Soviet Russia . As in Washington 's day , Mr. Truman said , our first ; ask must be to defend de- , mocracy against its enemies . That requires unity and concerted action among the free nations of the world , which we are trying to establish both within the United Nations and , within its framework , through the North Atlantic Pact and the military aid prdgram . But the , aim of defense is not to impose our way of life on others but to ' deter aggression . Subject to this primary aim , we shall continue to do our utmost both to find peaceful means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking agreements on the reduction of armaments and the control of atomic weapons . In this connection , and possibly with an oblique reference to the issue raised by Winston Churchill , Mr. Truman declared that we continue to believe in the United Nations as the proper forum for reaching such agreements , and that we also hold fast to the plan approved by the great majority of the United Nations . But he added that we have no pride of authorship and that we shall continue to explore every avenue and every possibility of reaching new agreements , provided that they are no mere sham but offer an effective andworkable control system which will decrease , and not increase , the dangers to the world . Our second task , mr . Truman pointed out , must be to make democracy work at Home and abroad . , That quires not onl .. the propagation of ideals but also the creation of an e nomic basis for their realization .
