TOMORROW AND YESTERDAY ( 250 pp. ) - Heinrlch Boll-Criterion ( $2.50 ) . <P> <P> Periodically , eleven-year-old Martin Bach is catechized by his grandmother . " Your father fell in action , did n't he ? " " Yes . " " What does it mean-fell in action ? " " Killed in the war . Shot . " " Where ? " " Near Kalinovka . " . . . " What is the name of the man responsible for your father 's death ? " " Gaseler . " " Repeat the name . " " Gaseler . " " Once more . " " Gaseler . " " Do you know what it means to deprive a child of his father ? " " Yes . " <P> Martin knows-and so does his best friend Heinrich , whose father was also killed on the Eastern front . It meant that Father was replaced by an " uncle . " Sometimes the uncles are nice , like Martin 's Uncle Albert , who shares the same house as Martin 's mother , but not her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heinrich 's Uncle Leo , the last of a long succession of uncles who moved in with his mother , stayed a while , and moved out . <P> Cued Films . To Martin and Heinrich , small boys in a Rhineland city , the war is like a persistent , annoying noise heard from a distance . The war means the NAZIS-whom Uncle Albert called terrible , but who are described by their schoolteachers as NOT so BAD . It means the rubble of the city that was being swiftly replaced by angular , modern buildings . Martin and Heinrich would just as soon forget the war , and so would their elders , bowed by a dead weight of memory and guilt . Martin 's mother Nella , a blonde beauty who looks " exactly like the women pictured in the Nazi books about race-only not so boring . " drifts through the years giving and going to dull parties . It seems to her that she is endlessly playing in an endless movie . People answer the phone the way actors do in second-rate films ; they smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stand and posture just as if a director were cueing every scene . <P> When she meets the hated Gaseler , the Nazi who was responsible for her husband 's death at Kalinovka , Nella has a moment of wild hope that reality has at last broken through the interminable bad movie of life . But the film grinds on , the director calls for the cinema dramatics of the great confrontation scene , and Nella can find neither hatred nor pity in her heart - only boredom with this ridiculous villain . But Grandma , who does not realize she is merely a character actress , demands vengeance . Uncle Albert , as exhausted by heroics as Nella , seeks out Gaseler and knocks him down . " Cut ! " cries the invisible director . <P> Typo Trick . This fourth U.S.-published novel by Heinrich Boll ( Adam , Where Art Thou ? The Train Was on Time ) , best of Germany 's postwar novelists , needs all his skill to emerge convincingly from a clumsy translation . A typographical trick of frequently capitalizing phrases and sentences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no discernible reason .
