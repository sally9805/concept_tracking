Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar , a chubby man of 56 , last week commemorated the day 24 years ago when , as a lowly army sergeant , he threw out a bumbling government and began his long career as off-and-on President and strongman of Cuba . But even as he pep-talked loyal troops at Camp Columbia , outside Havana . Batista warily shuffled guards at all military installations , held Havana cops on the alert in their barracks . Rumors were flying that the bearded young rebel , Fidel Castro , holed up in the Sierra Maestra , planned to celebrate Batista 's 24th anniversary with an uprising . Next morning the revolt came , in the sugar port of Cienfuegos ( pop . 99.000 ) , Cuba 's seventh city . <P> Mutiny . About 300 navy men , defectors to the Castro cause , mutinied at dawn and quickly seized control of the Cienfuegos naval station , built on a peninsula in the town 's harbor . They clapped pro-Batista officers in the brig and swept out through town in jeeps , carrying arms from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 200 pro-Castro civilians were waiting to join them . The rebels swept into Marti Park in the center of town , surrounded the pro-Batista national police headquarters and demanded surrender . The police refused . While two rebel navy planes circled overhead , the rebels charged , and after a vicious fight that littered the street with dead , the building fell . By noon rebels controlled the city-the first such feat they have been able to pull off since last November , when they held the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba for a few hours in a badly timed prelude to Castro 's seaborne invasion from Mexico . It was also the first big show of strength outside the Santiago area , where rebel sentiment is strongest . Most important , it was the first time that some of Batista 's military forces had gone over to the rebel cause . <P> Defeat . But the uprising was doomed to short life . By early evening Batista 's troops and tanks were rolling into Cienfuegos from nearby Santa Clara , while B-26s and F-47s from Camp Columbia pounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by morning the rebels had fled into the hills or had died defending their battered strongholds . <P> Estimates of the death toll ran from 75 to 200 ; the dead included two navy captains and the commandant of the maritime police . The army colonel in charge of mop-up operations was wounded . Three rebel navy officers , 13 enlisted men and three maritime police were captured and flown to Havana to face a rough round of questioning on how the revolt got started . Batista 's troops began a house-to-house search for a reported 2,000 guns distributed to civilians from the arsenal . <P> As in other bloody episodes of the anti-Batista war , the Castro men had shown plenty of nerve but little coordination . But by proving he could subvert Batista 's well-fed , well-trained military , Castro had punched a worrisome hole in the dictator 's armor.
