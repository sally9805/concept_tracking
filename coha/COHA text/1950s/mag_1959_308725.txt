<P> In his dealings with the big powers , Cambodia 's saxophone-tootling Prince Norodom Sihanouk tries to play it real cool at both ends of the scale . The 36-year-old Prince ( who resigned as King in 1955 because he likes being Premier better ) has welcomed aid missions to Cambodia from the U.S. , France , Russia and Communist China alike . After tours of Red China and the U.S. , he proclaimed himself impressed by both . But Neutralist Sihanouk is sadly out of tune with his next-door neighbors on the Gulf of Siam . <P> Neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam strongly disapprove of Sihanouk 's diplomatic recognition of Peking last July , but their differences really date back to ancient tribal feuds and jungle rivalries . South Viet Nam declares that Cambodia allows Communist Viet Minh guerrillas to cross its territory to stage raids in South Viet Nam ; in retaliation , South Vietnamese troops picked up a border marker , moved it 1 miles into Cambodia and threw a minefield around it . Thailand has given haven to opponents of Sihanouk . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sihanouk accepted increased economic aid from Red China , broke diplomatic relations with Thailand . In recent months the volatile Prince has grown more nervous . <P> Something to Chew On . The most respected soldier in Cambodia was Dap Chhuon ( pronounced Chew-on ) . As a reward for his brilliant rise from French army corporal-dap means corporal-to guerrilla leader , against first the French and then the Communist Viet Minh , Dap Chhuon had been named Royal Delegate and Governor of the Siemrap area , which includes the renowned ruins of the lost 12th century Khmer civilization of Angkor Wat . Slim , natty Dap Chhuon made Siemrap his personal fief with three battalions of Cambodia 's 31,000-man army under his personal command . <P> Recently Communist informers reported to Sihanouk that Dap Chhuon planned , with help from Thailand , to assassinate the Premier , overthrow the monarchy and establish an anti-Communist republic . Sihanouk dispatched a battalion to Siemrap with orders to get Dap Chhuon , dead or alive . <P> Dap Chhuon fled in the night into the jungles in his under-sarong . Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shortly afterward the government announced that Dap Chhuon had died " of injuries , " but had made " important revelations " first to his captors . <P> Message to Ike . Pictures of Dap Chhuon 's bleeding body were posted in triumph on the trees lining Pnompenh 's avenues , and Sihanouk flew a delegation of foreign diplomats into Siemrap to show them the " proof " of a plot-two captured Vietnamese radio operators , $4,000,000 worth of gold , and a purported message to Cambodian exiles in Thailand asking the strength of their forces . Brushing aside the denials from Thailand and South Viet Nam , Sihanouk thanked the Communists for tipping him off , and then turned on a " certain leading power " that furnishes arms to both Thailand and South Viet Nam . Demanding to know why the U.S. , if not involved , had not told him of the plot , Sihanouk fired off a message to President Eisenhower asking U.S. intervention to prevent " further subversion " of Cambodia with U.S. arms .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
