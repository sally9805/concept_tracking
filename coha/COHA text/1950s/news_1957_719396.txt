txt COCOA BEACH , Fla. , Dec. 18 ? Less than nineteen hours after the successful test firing of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile , an Army Jupiter was launched from Cape Canaveral tonight . The Defense Department announced in Washington and here that the launching had been " successfully carried out . " But in a single supplementary sentence issued a little later , the department added : " The missile failed to complete its full flight because of technical difficulties . " The Jupiter is an intermediaterange ballistic missile . While an ICBM like the Atlas is intended to go about 5,500 miles , surface to surface , an IRBM has a 1,500-mile range . In size , the Army Jupiter is from twenty to thirty feet shorter than the Air Force Atlas , which rears more than eighty feet tall . In girth , the Jupiter is about a foot narrower at its widest diameter than the Atlas , nearly nine feet across . The exact dimensions , and the exact power of the rocket 's thrust , are classified . The Jupiter is knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were attributed to fuel slosh  --  the shifting of the liquid fuel within the cylindrical chamber . It is known that beside these two failures the Jupiter was fired at least once and perhaps more , than once to the limit of its range of 1,500 miles at an altitude of 250 to 300 miles . Although much technical attention has been devoted to correcting the problem of fuel slosh , no explanation was offered tonight as to the nature of the difficulties of the latest test . Actually , what happened tonight might have been an example of what Maj. Gen. Donald N. Yates , commander of the Air Force Missile Test Center here , said yesterday at a news conference . He was commenting on the launching of the Atlas . The general and an official of Convair , prime contractor on Atlas , agreed that what is a " failure " to the casual viewer may be a success to the experts because of the data transmitted by the missile during its flight . On the other hand , the gen // eral said , a " success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure " in terms of data . All eyewitnesses agreed that tonight 's Jupiter flight was spectacular . There was no way of knowing to what extent the ' failure to complete the full intended flight had cut short the desired flow-back of scientific data . Great interest was attached to the Jupiter 's launching be ' , cause of the speculation in some quarters that the Army might have moved up its schedule so ' as to try to launch not the original single-stage Jupiter , but , the multiple-stage Jupiter C. This is the vehicle with which the Army intends to try to put a projectile-shaped satellite into space , probably early next year . Reports Prove Incorrect Reports tonight , current in the first few minutes after the Jupiter rose from its pad on the Cape , impressing some witnesses as if it were " a giant Roman candle , " were that the Army had " sneaked up " its satellite . These reports turned out to be wholly without foundation . But even those who had witnessed many previous missile firings , including that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rocket rose superbly and with an unusually loud roar as it arched to the southeast . As is traditional , the rocket had been picked out on its launching stand , after the red and white gantry crane had been retired , by the beams of powerful searchlights . They pin'pointed it on the Cape like a gleaming white bullet pointed upward . Unpredictable " holds " during count-down periods in getting missiles ready for firings explain why the shots have so often come at night . This is a matter of coincidence rather than of intention . It was learned tonight that although another Atlas ICBM is ready for test firing , it will not be laur.ched in December . Yesterday 's Atlas was deliberately held to a short flight of from 500 to 900 miles . But it landed in its selected " impact area " and from the standpoint of performance and data , was declared to be a complete success . On June 11 and again on Sept. 25 , Atlas missiles had to be destroyed by the range safety officer as they flipped over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Yates emphasized yesterday that from the standpoint of data transmitted , the first of these two " failures " had actually been a 95 per cent success .
