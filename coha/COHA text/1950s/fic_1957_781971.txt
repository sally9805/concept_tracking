 | better build up his confidence a little bit . " Sandy just shrugged . " I ca n't do it all , " he said , very plainly , and lay down to investigate something on his stomach . According to the consensus , in which I was not included , the birds had gone through the swamp and out onto a slope on the side , but a slope that was still thickly wooded . We went into the swamp and , as we crossed , a single flushed wild on the edge . I banged at the blur , and a couple more got up . Nothing whatsoever dropped . You could barely see them through the branches . Frank considered briefly and then detoured me around the bird area . He stationed me up on the hill , and when I started to follow him down he said , " No , boy , for the love of Pete . I 'm trying to make it easy for you . " I stood on the slope . Frank sent Sandy down into the swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither dog made any effort to point . They found birds and flushed them , and when they flushed they were clear targets in the open . A ' short while later I had four more birds in my pocket . We worked back toward where I was to meet Ma . Sandy ? spied another sawdust heap and marched off toward it . This time the birds were in a three-foot copse of sparkleberry bushes . Murder . The dogs had given me so much confidence by now that I just sort of casually raised the gun and collected a double with as much assurance as if I 'd been a meat hunter with a sawed-off . Sandy sat down to investigate his rear end , as portion of which seemed to have been mislaid . Frank went and got the birds and stowed them in my coat . He looked up and told me that for a dumb kid I followed orders pretty good , and now let 's go home . I looked longingly over to where the birds had pitched in a field of broom straw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Old Man would n't like it . " I said okay , let 's go find Ma . The dogs never made a move to hunt , although I knew of at least three mor coveys in the land we passed . They just trotted along at heel . When we got back , the Old Man seemed not to be so near  | death as before , because I could detect a slight odor of the medicine he always used to ward off the chills . It came in charred kegs and was colored a mahogany red and was illegal at that time . He seemed real pleased when I spread the ten birds  --  six cocks and four hens  --  out in front of the fireplace . " Learn anything ? " he asked casually , puffing on the pipe . " Yessir , " I said . " One thing I know is that after the rains you got to hunt the high ground , because quail do n't like to get their feet wet , and at this time of the year there ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The birds are in the woods , eating the mast and what 's left of the berries . Also , they seem to like sawdust piles . " " I du n no why , " he said , " but seems to me I never recollect a sawdust pile that did n't have a covey of bobwhite using near it . Maybe they like to dust in it , or maybe they eat sawdust instead of grit to keep ' em healthy . Learn anything else ? " " Yessir . I learned that late in the afternoon , especially when it 's wet , birds do n't want to roost in a swamp , but will either settle down on the near side or fly through and put down on the far side . Also , they do n't fly so far late as they do early . Also , that there 's no point in trying to shoot in a swamp when you can stand on the side and send the dogs in to flush for you . " " Send the dogs in ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , the dogs went in , " I said , sort of lamely , " And they would n't let me go in with ' em ; so I stood on the side and shot four easy birds . " " Anything else ? " " Well , I found out I can shoot pretty good when I 'm out by myself . You do n't have to watch for the other fellow , and you can take chances on birds you would n't shoot at ordinarily , and somehow you pick up some confidence as you go along , because you 're relaxed and you do n't want to disappoint the dogs . " " That all ? " " Well , sir , one thing more . I reckon that there ai n't nothing  | anybody can tell a good dog that the dog do n't know better than the man . I reckon it 's the dog 's business to know his business . " The Old Man smiled a big , broad , tobacco-stained , mustachy smile . " I was kind of hoping to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few people ever learn it . You take a dog and you train him right , and then leave him alone and you got a good dog . The same thing applies to boys . Spoil a dog early , and no amount of hollering will cure him . That also applies to boys . Beat him when he 's bad , early , and you do n't have to take a stick to him later . Did you have to holler whoa at Sandy ? " " Just once . " " Did he whoa ? " " He whoaed . " The Old Man looked even more pleased . " Boy , " he said , " I will tell you a very wise thing . If a man is really intelligent , there 's practically nothing a good dog ca n't teach him . But a dumb man ca n't learn anything from a smart dog , while a dumb dog can occasionally learn something from a smart man . Remember that . " And now , " he said , and I knew what was coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good enough to shoot is good enough to use , and the longer you put off cleaning a bird or a fish the harder the job is . Scat now , because I got a hankering for some quail with my grits . I do n't believe I 'm going to die tonight after all . " The winter had gone in a wild , cold flurry of nasty rain , and the sun was beginning to be a little more prevalent . It was too late to shoot and too early to fish , too hot for football and too cold for baseball . I had the adolescent nervous twitches . You know , when the house is too small and there does n't seem to be anything around but school , with summer still too far off to be hopeful about . I reckon my behavior was not what the dictionary calls exemplary , unless it was a bad example . The Old Man looked at me with some amusement . I was in  | between engagements , so to speak , and he knew it . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard one day and showed me something . It was a pointer puppy , the saddest-looking pointer puppy I ever saw . It had feet as big as a grizzly bear 's and one twisted ear , and was about half-dead from the mange , the hair gone off its hide and the skin wrinkled pink and ugly . " This , " the Old Man said , " is a damned fine bird dog . Pretty much in the rough , I 'll admit , but a good dog nevertheless . 1 know about his parents . But he needs some work done on him , and the time to train a dog is in the spring , when you 've got nothing better to do . The first thing we will do is get rid of this mange . " " Where 'd you get him ? " I asked . " I never saw such a homely critter . " " Do n't let the looks fool you , " the Old Man cautioned . " His blood is better'n yours . What happened was that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell , and he left the bitch with a share-crop farmer and the whole litter picked up the mange . Once we get this mange fixed , you will have yourself a dog . And now that you been pretty well trained by the old dogs , mebbe you 'd better try your hand at training a puppy , so 's you can learn some more about dogs , from dogs . " I grinned just a little bit , remembering the other day when frank and Sandy gave me a kindergarten course . " What do we do about this mange ? " I asked him . " Very simple , " the Old Man said . " We go down to visit Gus McNeill at the filling station , and we beg some old used crankcase oil that he 's got , from changing the oil in automobiles from winter to spring . Then we go see Doc Watson in the drugstore , and we buy a little sulphur off him . We mix the sulphur with the old crankcase oil and douse the puppy in it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Man was right . We smeared the puppy with the mixture for a few days , and before long you could see the hair growing back , and it was n't more than a month before he was haired out real nice and beginning to grow up to his feet . We  | named him Tom , for some reason or other , and I took over his education . " A bird dog , " the Old Man told me , " is trained in the back yard . There ai n't no way in the world you can teach him to smell ; so you do n't have to bother about that . There ai n't no way in the world you can teach him bird sense ; so there ai n't any use worrying about that . All you can teach this dog is a little discipline , so that he can use his talents to the best advantage . Like they 're trying to teach you a little discipline in school . Whether you got brains enough to take advantage of it is strictly up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked the Old Man . " Well , there 's all sorts of ways to train a dog and not break him . Do n't you ever let me hear you use the word break . ' You do n't want a broken dog . You want to educate him , not crush him . A man who 's got to break a dog do n't deserve the dog . All you want to teach him is a little common sense and some politeness . The first thing you want to teach him is the difference between yes and no . We 'll start with something basic , like food . " We only fed the dogs once a day ; so they were pretty hungry . We fed ' em mostly table scraps and hard cold hominy and a lot of cold corn bread and turnip greens and fatback and now and then a can of salmon or some canned dog food , but not much . We fed them about five o'clock in the afternoon , and we always fed each dog out of his own tin pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed neither Frank nor Sandy ever made a move at the dinner pail until the Old Man snapped his fingers and said , " Hie on . " And right in the middle of the meal , if the Old Man said , " Whoa ! " they quit eating . Old Frank was pretty cute . You could put a sliver of steak or some other tasty victual on his nose and he 'd just sit there , and when you gave him the okay word he 'd flip his head , toss the meat in the air , catch it , , swallow it , and then sort of take a bow . We trained the puppy very simple . We put his pan down , and when he lunged for the food I 'd just grab him by the tail  | and say , " Whoa ! " I would gentle him some and tell him he was a fine upstanding puppy , and then I would say , " Hie on " and let him go . It did n't take a week for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I would say , " Whoa " and he 'd whoa . He would turn his head and wait for the snapped fingers and the words , " Hie on , " and then he would eat . In the middle of the meal I 'd grab him by the tail again and say , " Whoa . " I e learned that one in about two days . When I said , " Whoa , " even when he was swallowing , he would quit , haul back on his haunches , and wait the word again . Like all puppies , he loved to go dashing after sticks or balls , and , like all puppies , he liked to run off with the stick or the ball and tease you with it . He was not what you 'd call a naturalborn retriever . He was a joker . The Old Man showed me how to lick that one , too . We bent a line on his collar and chucked out the stick , and when he picked it up and started off for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a leap with the rope and hollered , " Fetch ! " Then he hauled him in so fast that he was sitting in front of us without his feet actually having touched the ground very often on the return trip . We added " Fetch " to his vocabulary in about three days . He quit thinking that this business of bringing things was a game . It was now a serious business . " The thing about a dog , " the Old Man said , " is that you got to teach him the difference between business and pleasure . And you got to keep reminding him of it . Like about rabbits . There never was a good bird dog that did n't like to chase rabbits . Rabbits are fun for him , where quail are just hard work . You can tell when a bird dog is pointing a rabbit , because he points all hunched up and with his ears cocked and his nose turned down kind of quizzical , and then he 'll jump and look around at you like the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite sure what it is . The way to keep a dog from running rabbits is to discourage him early . We 'll do this in the fall , before the bird season opens . " In the meantime we will not let him run loose this sum-  | mer , because a dog gets into a lot of bad habits in the summertime ; and if you turn him loose to chase everything and anything , come autumn he has forgot what his real business is and ai n't much good for anything in particular . I do n't approve of chasing dogs except for a couple of things . One is running rabbits and the other is running up quail . A puppy is going to do both at first , out of natural high spirits and just plain puppy dam-foolishness . I would n't give you a nickel for a dog that was n't jealous about another dog over the quail subject , but he 's got to learn to control that jealousy , even if it drives him crazy . Else you got no dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended on . " We spent the spring teaching this pointer puppy Torn his back-yard manners , and we spent the summer insisting that he remember what we taught him in the spring . He learned " Heel , " and he learned " Down , " and he learned that the back of the car , not the front , was where he was supposed to jump into . He learned " Fetch " and " Go " and " Hie on " and " Whoa . " He learned that a whistle was not a tin toy but had some pointed meaning , and that when you waved an arm one way it did n't mean that he was supposed to run the other way . All this time he never smelled a quail . The summer passed and the leaves turned rosy-crisp . It was nearly time for the bird season to open , and here I had me a puppy , almost grown up to fit his feet , that was like one of those correspondence-course students who 's learned it all by mail but has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know whether I had an idiot or a genius , but at least his table manners were perfect . One Sunday afternoon in early October the Old Man said , " All the young birds are big enough now not to mind a bit o bother , and most of the snakes have gone to ground . Why do n't we take the puppy out and see if he 's got any sense at all ? " We took him out in the back section where there was a kind of tame covey of quail we could always locate , either in the broom straw or the grove or in the peafields , that the Old Man  | had taught me to shoot on and had always schooled the dogs on . We never shot it down under ten birds , and we always planted plenty of food for ' em and left plenty of cover , so that the birds stayed and stayed for all the years I can remember , sort of like being in the family . The first thing the puppy did was point a rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , his tongue hanging out , looking triumphant . All the " Whoas ! " I 'd screamed had n't made a dent in his eardrums . " Whip him , " the Old Man said . " Whip him good . Wear hint out . And say , No ! ' I cut an Indian-arrow switch and beat him pretty good . The next rabbit , he jumped at , ran a little ways after , and then came back and lay on his back , all four feet in the air , and said , more or less , " Beat me , boss . " I beat him , but not very hard . And that was the last of the rabbit trouble . He had learned some early discipline in the back yard . We steered him to where the quail had to be , and they were there . It was a funny sight to see . He was like a potential drunkard who had never tasted whisky before and had suddenly got the smell of it . He did n't know what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he had something to do about it . I Ic approached very cautiously , cakewalking , and in the great moment of indecision , the moment he did n't know himself what he was going to do and when every inclination was to jump off and chase , he paid off his professors . He had a brief argument with himself , and he won it . What he did was stick his rail high in the air like a knobby flagstaff , and stiffen his body into a crouch , and raise his right front paw , and aim his nose right smack at where he thought something he 'd never Bern and never smelled was . And he stayed there , in that position , and he would be there now if I had n't walked past him and kicked up the birds and said , " Whoa , " when he started to chase them , and he whoaed in mid-leap and watched them fly away . He watched where they pitched and went over and pointed  | five single birds , and never made a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . But I do know that all the days he lived he never had another stick to his hide and rarely a command . He never ran another rabbit , and after the first " Whoa , " when he was working with the old dogs , he never crowded a point . He would backstand until you needed a bulldozer to move him . I took him out alone on the first day of the season , in another part of the country , with which he was entirely unfamiliar . He was less than nine months old . He went magically to the first covey , without fiddling , without fuss , without falsepointing . When he had it made , he made it , and lifted his forefoot again to tell me about it . The birds rose , and I killed the first one and missed the second . He did not chase . " Fetch ! " I said , and he sped straight to where he 'd marked the bird  --  a bird whose feathers he had never tasted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid it in my hand and spat out the feathers and said , " Well , boss , they went thataway , " just like the old dogs did . And thataway was where they went , and where we went , and where the birds were , like he said . I went home that day with a coatful of birds and a glowing progress report , but the Old Man was n't the least bit impressed . " I told you , " he said , " that this mangy puppy had the right blood in him . When a dog or a person 's got the right blood , all he needs is a couple of suggestions to use the blood right . I hope you turn out as well as the puppy , but , like I said , the puppy 's bloodlines may be a little better than yours . At least , though , I did n't have to cure you of the mange. "  | All Colts Are Crazy in the Spring We were living at a place called Wrightsville Sound that spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had numberless attractions for a boy . As is so much of the coastal South , it was semitropic . There were vast forests of gnarled , craggy liveoak trees , which were hung with Spanish moss , and tall timberlands of longleaf pine . The Sound itself led to two inlets on a beach two miles away , and the tides brought ocean fish into the Sound and kept the water clean . There were little back bays that were full of fish , and in the winter , ducks . The woods were chattery with squirrels , little gray fellows and the big black-and-silver fox squirrels . There were quail in the brushy flats , and some deer , and rabbits untold . The trees were full of the bright blue jays I  | never seem to see these days , and the little bluebirds that have also made themselves scarce . Even the wild vegetation was exciting to a youngster . There were whole groves of wild plum , and the wild asparagus shot up in the spring , and there were blackberries growing wild by the millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little brown sweet nuts like chestnuts  --  and wild artichokes . There was almost no day in the year when a boy could n't go out on an expedition of his own and make an adventure of living off the country . A bellyache usually accompanied the experience , but at least a man felt free of his parents and the necessity of carrying a box lunch . At this time I was almost completely a young Tarzan . There was no house that could hold me . I swung through the trees like an ape , and generally managed to bust something about once a month . I had a tree house built high in the branches of a wild cherry , and an interlocking series of caves that threatened to undermine the county . My progress in school was deplorable , because I was just marking time for that last bell to sound and let me loose into the bush . There was a convenient stream  --  we called it a crick  --  near the school , and we would slip off at recess and go swimming naked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nasty notes were written to parents . I did n't know then who I was , but it was a cross between Tom Sawyer , Huck Finn , Tarzan , Daniel Boone , Buffalo Bill , and all the heroes of Ernest Thompson Seton . I contracted ground itch and poison ivy and various wound , from fish hooks . Jellyfish stung me in the water . I played hooky constantly and acquired magnificently bad report cards in the process . My mother caught me smoking secretly , and there w a loud flap about that . My companions were mostly fishermen , and my language was shocking . I was about to run away and join the Indians  --  somewhere , I do n't know where  --  when one day the Old Man looked at me sort of sardonically with one eyebrow cocked and said , " Hey ! " " Yessir ? " I said .  | " It 's about time you calmed down a little , young feller , " he said . " You ' mind me of a young buck Apache with no warpath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all colts go crazy in the spring , but you need some sort of project to quiet you down . I think I got the answer : a boat . There 's something about a boat that is powerful soothing to springtime hysterics . If you 'll pay a little more attention to clean ears and arithmetic , I 'll help you build one this month , and when school 's over you can learn a whole lot of new things about fish and water this summer . You can also learn a whole lot about yourself . Ai n't nothing like a boat to teach a man the worth of quiet contemplation . " The business of building the boat took the rest of the spring . The Old Man was working very methodical . He collected a great pile of planks and some sawhorses and stuck them in the back yard . What he was aiming for was a twelve-foot flat-bottom skiff , broad in the beam , that would n't draw any water at all and could be controlled by a boy , but that had room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shooting gear . She had a locker under the stern sheets to keep fish or lunch in , and a bait locker . I reckon this was the cheapest piece of construction that ever went into a boat , because he got the wood for nu ) thing from his friend in the sawmill , including the hickory that went into the oars that he whittled out himself and fined down with sandpaper until they were as smooth as glass . He littld the strakes so close that , once we stuck her in the water and Ict her seams swell , she never leaked another drop . The Old Man scorned a two-piece keel . He went out into the woods until he found a piece of hickory  --  dead but not decayed ? with the right curve in it , and he built the boat around it . Apart from the nails and the anchor , there was n't a piece of ctal in her . He despised oarlocks , noisy , clumsy iron things at were always falling overboard or being stolen or that you ci to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber thole pins that cradled an oar like a mother holds her baby and did about half the rowing for you . We named her the Charlotte Morse after two strong-minded women we  | were both afraid of , and cracked a Coca-Cola over her for launching purposes . The Old Man had a slightly more serious snort . He was n't one to waste good whisky by pouring it over a boat . If I ever get rich , I may buy me a boat of some sort , but it 'll never have the adventures that the Charlotte had . They were never big adventures . I looked for buried treasure on Money Island with her , and got blistered by the sun , but never found the pieces-of-eight . I fell out of her and stuck her on sand bars and had to swim after her now and again when she slipped her moorings . I shot out of her and caught fish out of her and got lost in her and durn near drowned alongside her . But like I said , she gave me some quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , because none of it was vicarious , which means , I think , getting your thrills out of what somebody else has already done better . When I was out alone in that boat , I never had to worry about amusement . I was Captain Blood looking for pirates , or I was actually on Treasure Island , running from Long John Silver . I was Zane Grey catching marlin off New Zealand  --  wherever that was  --  or I was a section of the Spanish Armada or I was Hawkins or Drake . Occasionally I was Robinson Crusoe , marooned on a little island and looking for a Friday . I used to take those books with me and read ' em while pulled up for lunch on one of the thousands of little sandy islands , and they meant a lot more than they did on the Required List at the schoolhouse library , with some four-eyed schoolmarm standing over me . But mostly I learned about how much fun a man can have amusing himself , and about how exciting solitude can be if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , row her out to one of the sand bars , jab an oar deep in the sand , and make her fast . Then I would kick around in the ooze , feeling for clams with my feet and looking for soft-shell crabs . When I had a mess of clams , I would take the cast net and prowl the shallows for mullet and shrimp for bait , casting the net in a  | great circular spread that drove upward sharp slivers of water as she settled , with the shrimp and the mullet bucking and arching inside the cords . In time I got to know , just by experimentation , where all the better holes were  --  where the big blackfish lived , where the weakfish hung out , where you could n't catch anything but spinybacked perch . Sometimes I would take the boat around into the channel and have fun with the skipjacks , the little channel bluefish , and then I would tie her up under the channel bridge by the barnacle-encrusted pilings and fish very quietly for sheepshead . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the big black-and-yellow fellows , whose claws were all white meat and whose body was practically nonexistent , was a big event . But the best of it was at night , when you rigged up a jack light , took her out on a low tide , and let her drift gently while you looked for the shadow of flounders in the flickering yellow glow . You used a three-pronged harpoon and nailed the flounder to the bottom , and he flopped mightily when you dragged him into the boat . I used to sell the flounders , if I had a good night , and made what to me was a power of money , sometimes as much as a whole dollar . Some of the best part of going out in the boat was eating the lunch I 'd caught myself , pulled up to another little sand bar or a palmetto island . I kept salt and pepper and a skillet in the locker , and there was always driftwood for a fire . It occurs to me now that I was dining then off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh clams and oysters and broiled soft crabs , the freshest fish in the world . Perhaps it was cooked crude , but I 've never eaten better since . It was maybe a three-mile pull at the end of the day , with your lips salty and burned from the glassy bounce of the sun off the water and your back sore and your bare feet shriveled from the salt water . That last half-mile pull seemed like it was never going to end , and it was a great temptation to just beach the boat and leave her dirty and full of mud and fish scales . But the  | Old Man had caught me at that a few times , and the weight of his scorn at filthy fishing was too heavy for me to bear . I would wash her out and make her fast , and string the fish and shoulder the oars , and stagger home so tired that I could have cried . Nobody had to whip me to get me to bed . I was plain-out beat . By the time that summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sound , every fish hole , every sand bar , every creek and cove . I knew the tricks of the tides around the inlets and the rate the water would drop , according to how the wind was blowing . It was all trial and error , cut feet , bruised fingers , mosquitoes and sandflies and sunburn . By the end of the summer I was considerably calmed down . Like the Old Man said , there is nothing like being alone on the water in a boat of your own to learn the value of peace , quiet. , and responsibility . I found out you did n't need companionship to amuse yourself ; that there are actually times when you can have more fun without people . A boy alone on a big water is a very small thing . I did n't ever tell the Old Man about the time I got caught in the rip and was swept out through the inlet into the sea , and had to let the boat go out more than a mile on the ocean before I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach . I did n't tell anybody about the dead man I found  --  what was left of him  --  jammed into a little wedge of marsh . He 'd been in the water a long time . Did n't tell , either , about the rusty nail I had to cut out of my foot with a pocketknife I had cauterized in a fire . I remember that very clear , sawing and hacking at the underpart of to big toe , with the nail run clean up under the ball of my foot , the knife dull and me alternately crying and cussing . Told my mother I cut it on an oyster shell when I asked her for t iodine . I guess I was afraid they would keep me out of the bo and the marsh hen season was coming along , with the big sw len tides of the September northers . When the tides covered the marsh grasses so that only tips showed , the big rails had no place to hide and would  | awkwardly up ahead of you , birds as big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat then , and they flew so slow that you could leave the pole stuck in the ooze , grab a gun , and still knock down the bird . Or sometimes you moored the boat and got out of her , prowling the edges of the shore line , where the birds had come in from their flooded-out home in the marsh . They flushed skittering like snipe , and headed for water , and it was fine shooting . Schooltime came again , and the weather got colder , and we hauled the boat up and put her on rollers for the winter . I went back to school feeling a little more like a man and a little less like a boy . I reckon the Old Man knew what he was talking about when he said there was nothing like a boat to smooth the kinks out of a kid . This must have shown on the report card a little bit , because for Christmas that year there was a little one-lunged outboard motor under the tree . The Old Man said he guessed I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women It was one of those special days in May , when there was a drowsy , almost-June feel to the softly stirring air . The little warblers were twittering away in yellow clouds in the molting fruit trees , and a catbird was meowing softly in a hedge . The sky was a pale washed-denim blue , and the sun shone down gold and warm but not hot . It was a day to sit , maybe , or perhaps a fishing day , but it was not a day to do anything that might rile up the blood . The womenfolk were housecleaning , flapping sheets and dusting and sweeping and tormenting things , as women will , and the Old Man was nowhere to be seen . The Liz was sitting in the front yard , under the oak trees ; so Himself could n't have strayed far . In our town there were only so many places where  | he might be  --  the Cedar Bench , the pilot office , the poolroom , Uncle Jimmy 's store , or Watson 's drugstore . I walked slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a slow sight on the Cedar Bench . It seemed to have a cluster of old gentlemen perched on it like crows , and amongst the old black coats , battered sea captain 's caps , shapeless yellowed palmettos , and ratty old felts was the Old Man . The Cedar Bench , I might say , was the exclusive property of the town 's elder statesmen . It was a square wooden bench surrounding a wind-twisted , salt-silvered , ancient cedar . About equidistant from the pilothouse , the ship chandlery , and the shrimp dock with the shrimp houses , it was n't too far from the fuel dock or the wharf where the pilot boat was moored , and the other docks where the pogie fleet tied up . The old Cedar Bench still hung together , but flimsylike , because it had been whittled at until parts of it were no wider than your hand . It had so much aimless knifework on it that the Old Man once remarked that if you sat long enough on enough sections of it your behind would eventually be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over fifty years old . Nobody talked very much on the Cedar Bench , except around election time . It was a place of meditation . The Old Man was meditating real good when I arrived . He had his hat pulled down on top of his nose , like the pictures you sometimes see of Mr. Bernie Baruch sitting on a park bench . The 01 ( 1 Man 's eyes were closed and his pipe had gone out . He had one knee cocked up , and his bony , brown-freckled hands were clasped around the knee . There was little sound except the scream of a sea gull , the hum of insects , and an occasional splat as one of the other elder statesmen ejected an amber stream of tobacco juice at an unwary butterfly . Some of those old boys could spit a curve against the wind and were deadly with the poolroom spittoon at ten paces . I went and sat quietly down alongside the Old Man , and bimeby he opened first one eye , then the other . Ile kind of  | shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , " he said . " What 're you up to ? " " Nothin ' very much , " I said . " The womenfolk were cleaning house and it made me nervous . " " Makes me nervous too , " he said , heaving himself to his feet . " I come down here for a rest  --  snuck out early when I heard the mops begin to swish and the buckets to rattle . Come on , let 's walk down to the end of the dock so 's we wo n't disturb these other gentlemen . It seems to be housecleaning day all over town . " We strolled down to the T-shaped end of the dock . The Old Man sat down creakily and leaned his back against a bollard , and I did the same . The gulls wheeled and curved and sailed on stiff wings , and the water was dimpled with the breeze , the sun striking tiny little sparks off the droplets . The Old Man fetched up a gusty sigh and stuffed his pipe . " I reckon most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-'count lazy , " he remarked to one of the wheeling gulls . " It ai n't necessarily so . Your grandma , if she ever saw fit to dirty her shoes on the water front , would take one look at the Bench and say something , with a sniff fore-and-aft of it , like : Look at those good-for-nothing loafers , so lazy that dead lice would n't drop off them , when they could be doing a hundred things we 've been at them all winter to get done . ' But , of course , that is women for you . It is the reason that , apart from having babies , no woman has ever done a first-class job of anything . They ca n't even cook as good as men . It 's because they do n't take the time to think . They 're all like little old banty hens , scratching and pecking and looking around at every noise with beady eye that 's meant to be intelligent but ai n't . " I had to laugh a little at that one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're never still , always peering at their backs , looking for lice with their heads swiveled all the way round , or pecking at their chests or under their wings , or scratching , or flapping wings , or jumping up on something , and always cackling , either with indignation or in triumph  | when they 've squeezed out another egg . Grandma  --  housecleaning , with a towel wrapped round her head , a dustcloth in one hand , and a feather duster in another  --  was just like a littlebitty old banty hen . She only paused to squawk . " Now you take me , " the Old Man said . " I 'm not really lazy . A lazy man is a man who fiddles and fools around with a job he 's supposed to be working at . I know a lot of do-less cusses like that . There is a difference between laziness and meditation , even meditation with the eyes closed . Just because I close my eyes and sit in the sun do n't mean I 'm triflin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " today I am recovering from the rigors of the cold winter and the wet and windy spring . I am recovering from the past and storing up strength for the future . There ai n't no telling what the next six months will bring that will call for full concentration and maximum effort . If I should git myself into some sort of big operation , such as inventing an airyoplane or running for Congress , it would be a shame to tackle it all wore out from last year 's labors , and let some fresh , rested feller get the best of me . " I interrupted . " But you 're a man grown , " I said . ( The Old Man did n't like anybody to refer to him as old , except himself . ) " I ai n't nothing but what Aunt Mae calls a shirt-tail boy . It seems to me that there is some sort of grown-up rule that rest is bad for boys , that they got to be doing something all the time . I never set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast net that one of the women did n't come marching in with some chore for me to do , like going to the store or running over to Aunt Ada 's for a cup of something or half a pound of something else . " " Unjust , unjust , " the Old Man sighed . " Boys need more rest than grown-ups . Boys are busy growing bones and making incite to go on the bones , which is a full-time job in itself . Boys burtll up more juice than grown-ups . Boys run a kind of a fever until they 're past twenty-one years old . There seems to be some sort of deluded idea that boys were created to run errands for the old folks . "  | " Just like boys ai n't supposed to like white meat . " I was a little bitter . " Boys are supposed to like backs and wings and legs and the part that goes over the fence last . Grown-ups are supposed to like white meat . Boys are supposed to like to split kindling and clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rake yards and cut grass . Speaking as boy to man , I would sure admire to say that the grown-up idea of what boys like is a sight different from what boys think boys like . " " True , too true , " the Old Man said . " And unjust . But the grown-up 's idea is that he 's conditioning the boy for the toils and troubles of manhood . " " I 'm going to be all wore out by the time I run into any toils and troubles of manhood , " I said darkly . " I ai n't got any time for what you call meditation , except when I 'm hunting or fishing . " " I 'd say you had enough time , then , " the Old Man said tartly . " Seeing as how you manage to do one or t' other or both for about ten months a year , whenever you ai n't in school . You never seem to be tired from rowing a boat ten miles or walking six hours in the rainy woods behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Work is doing what you do n't like to do because somebody tells you to do it . " The Old Man ignored that for a bit . He chawed on his pipe stem and spat at a sea gull that flew too close . " Speaking of work , " he said , " I am so rested up from this morning that I feel like a little honest toil would n't kill neither one of us . I 'll make you a deal . You know that fishin ' shack of ours took a powerful pounding this winter when we had them two hurricanes in a row . I figgered we 'd build her back stronger this time . There 's plenty of solid driftwood all up and down Caswell , big joists and logs and such as that . Now , if you was to stir yourself and walk  --  not run  --  up the street to your Uncle Jimmy 's store and buy us a mess of provisions , such as sour pickles , johnnycake , a little fatback , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosey over to the house and gather up the rest of the truck we need . We can spend the  | week end ? The women are so busy getting everything antiseptic they 'll never miss us . " That sounded like a fair-enough deal . I got up and stuck out a hand to the Old Man , hauled him creaking to his feet , and we walked off the dock . He headed home ; I set a course for Uncle Jimmy 's . Now I could cheat and pretend that it happened to me , but it did n't . It happened to a little colored boy , and it was the standing joke around town . Most of Pa 's family was pretty relaxed , but Uncle Jimmy was the champion relaxer of them all . He was relaxing when I got to the store , sitting on something on the porch , his hat over his eyes and his little fat hands folded on his little fat stomach . " Hey , there , " I said . " Hey , there , son , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out and add it up on a paper sack and leave the sum on the counter . " He closed his eyes to the bright sun . I snickered . The story was that one day a little colored boy came to the store and found Uncle Jimmy in the same position . " What can I do for you , son ? " Uncle Jimmy kept his eyes closed . " Papa sen ' me say he need a poun ' tenpenny nails , Mistah Jimmy . The back po'ch near ' bout fallin ' down . " " You go look ' em , son , " Uncle Jimmy said . " I think they 're in the back of the store som'ers . Look som'ers around the pickle barrel and the overhalls . " The little colored boy disappeared and returned . " They ai n't there , Mistah Jimmy . " " Well , son , try som'ers around the eatin ' tobacco and the snuff and the two-for-a-penny cakes . You know , them pink ones with the coconut strings and the choc'late marshmellers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , rummaged around , and reappeared . " I swear ' fo ' Gawd and three ' sponsible witness , Mistah Jimmy , I done look high an I done look low , but I cai n't fin ' no tenpenny nails . " " You look ' round the yard goods and the bellywash and t  | lickrish sticks ? You look up high where we keep the Army shoes and the sardines ? " " Yassuh . I done look everywhere and I cai n't fin ' um . " Uncle Jimmy stirred , scratched his head , wrinkled his brow . " I know we got some , " he said . " I ordered a mess from the hardware drummer last time he was around , and a whole shipment come in on the Willing But Slow the other day . " Uncle Jimmy let out a sudden guffaw and slapped his leg . " That 's a joke on me , son , " he wheezed . " Whilst we been talking about them nails , I been settin ' on the nail keg this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , closing his eyes again , " suppose you come back again t'morrow . " That 's what they told on Uncle Jimmy , anyhow . They said he was the first man in the business to invent self-service , which became so popular later on . Except he did n't believe in a cash business . He sent- out bills once every so often , when he thought about it , and when small boys came to pay the bills for their people he was always good for a sack of jawbreakers or one of those mammoth , sickly sweet soft drinks he called bellywash . I knew where everything in the store was ; so I made my purchases , scribbled down the total on a paper sack with a nubbin of a pencil , hooked a pink-striped peppermint , and went out into the sun . Uncle Jimmy grunted what was probably good-by and never opened his eyes . By the time I walked most of the three long blocks home , the Old Man was in the Liz and heading in my direction . " Jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning like Old Ned upstairs and 1 give ' em the slip . Let 's skedaddle . I left a farewell message pinned to the lamp shade in the parlor . " We bumped happily over the shell road and headed toward Caswell . As we came to the creek you could smell the pogie factory , and the odor of ripe fish meal was sweet to the nostrils , was the hot smell of rotting marsh . The red-winged blackrds rode the tops of the waving marsh grass , and away off a fish hawk was circling , looking for his dinner . The sun shone brighter , and the Old Man grinned . " How was Jimmy ? "  | " Just the same . All I got to do is look at him and I feel full of vinegar . I feel like work now . " " Me , too , " the Old Man said . " But I would n't of felt like it if I had n't of replenished myself this mornin ' . " We pulled up to wait for the little ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were n't in no particular hurry to get there , and I noticed the Old Man had his hat tilted forward over his eyes again . His breath , or maybe the breeze , ruffled his mustache . Today there 's a lot of people who do n't understand , when they see me sitting out in the yard in an easy chair , that I 'm not really loafing . I 'm doing what the Old Man said . I 'm recovering from the past and storing up for the future .  | 11 Summertime , and the Livin ' Was Easy June is a nice time of year , because school lets out and it has n't got real hot yet . The mornings are fresh and dewy and everything is green and sweet-smelling , and generally the mosquitoes have n't started and the nights are still cool enough for covers . The nicest thing about June is that the awful memories of school are behind you , and September is so far away that it does n't even count . The summertime belongs to boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country clubs and take vacations , but summer truly belongs to kids . It 's sunburn time and ground-itch time and poison-ivy time . It 's barefoot time and **28;0;TOOLONG time and baseball time and whippoorwill time and **32;30;TOOLONG time .  | Seems to me the summertime had so much good stuff in it that it should have been made illegal for most people . You had all sorts of wonderful things to give you the bellyache  --  peaches and pears and wild berries and tame berries , such as raspberries and strawberries , and the big purple plums and the yellow-and-rose plums , and the figs , and the big cool green watermelons or the tiger-striped ones that you took out of the cold water in the springhouse and ate by just shoving your face in and chewing on through . Finally , as the summer would wear on and it began to smell a little smoky in the air , like fall was knocking , the grapes came  --  the big , fat , juice-bursting scuppernongs , white and chokingly sweet , and the slightly tart black ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed up Sunday school as well as regular school in June , which suited me just fine . About all I ever learned in Sunday school was how to shoot craps down in the basement , a pastime so deplorable that Mr. James Stebbins , the sandy-haired Englishman ( a foreigner ! ) who tried to domesticate us young demons , eventually renovated our shocking morals by ringing in a pair of loaded dice and busting us all for the spring term of religious worship . He was as steely as a professional bookmaker about the IOU 's , and he put all his ill-got gains into the collection plate . I remember I was just paid out , and was feeling pretty religious about it , when the Old Man cornered me one morning after breakfast . It was one of those days when a boy figures he 's got to pop if something does n't happen to him  --  something big , something adventurous , something stupendous , like saving a maiden fair from the wild animals that have busted loose from the circus , or rushing into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything . Making tar balls out of the bubbling asphalt pavement was n't enough . Eating plums that were too green or trying out a sneaky slingshot on a catbird was n't enough . It was one of those days you maybe remember , with the bobolinks balanced on the bending grasses in the breeze , and the Baltimore orioles scattering notes around like millionaires throwing  | coins , and the wild cherries black and sweating sweet on the big leafy tree with the Tarzan house built into it . The Old Man stabbed me with his pipe stem and his eyes . " I been hearing about you , " he said . " I been hearing a lot of things about you  --  about how you cut Sunday school every other Sunday , and about that dice game you young hellions started down in the basement at Saint James ' , and it seems to me you are doomed for perdition . I thought I had you straightened out in the school business , but now I reckon I got to teach you a little humility . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin ' to get preached at , or made to do something I do n't want to without knowing why I do n't want to . The Old Man was awful shifty when he come down hard with the parables according to Himself . " What are you goin ' to do ? " I asked him . " Fishin ' , " he said cheerfully . " We 're just goin ' fishin ' . " Now , you certainly do n't punish a boy for irreverence by taking him fishing ; so there has got to be a catch in this one somewhere , I thought . But I had learned from the Old Man to play pretty cosy ; so all I said was , " What kind of fishin ' ? " " Fresh-water , " the Old Man said . " Maybe catch us a big of bass or so , or at least a mess of brim . We 'll take the Liz and rent us a boat from a man I know on Big Crick . Wait till I go get the rods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rotten logs and see if you can turn your undoubted talents to filling a tin can full of worms . " I ambled down to the cow lot , behind which there was a low , wet swamp where the pigs rooted and the quail came to drink , and turned over a few old punky logs and filled up a big paint can with fine fat worms , just as happy as worms to be wriggling around in the loose , wet dirt I put in the can . When I got back to the house , the Old Man had produced a couple of light split-bamboo rods and a couple of little reels that I never had seen before . " Where 'd they come from ? " I asked the Old Man . " Oh , " he said , " I 've had ' cm around for a long time . There 's  | a lot of things I got you do n't know about . I ai n't a man to take every whippersnapper I meet into my confidence . I got plenty of secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my secrets . On this coast it 's supposed to be sissy to fish fresh water ? either sissy or downright po ' barkerish . " A po ' barker is the kind of shiftless white trash who would be so trifling that he 'd have to feed his family off perch and catfish . I cranked the Liz , and we snorted off . I never went off in the old Liz without snickering a little bit . The Old Man said only a monkey was fit to drive one of the old T-models . " You need both hands on the wheel , both feet on the pedals , and a tail to keep the door shut , " he said . But they never built a better car . It would go anywhere that one of those Army tanks would go , and with about the same amount of noise . It rode high off the ground and looked like an old lady with her skirts held up off the mud , but it never wore out . We drove about fifteen miles and came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose , but Big Crick was what we called it . Actually , it was a little river that connected up somewhere with the Cape Fear River . There were a boathouse and a landing and a few skiffs pulled up alongside the landing . When we got there , it was about four o'clock in the afternoon . The Old Man paid fifty cents for the rent of a boat . He just indicated the oars to me with a jerk of his head , and I started pulling upstream in the slow , brown , leaf-dyed waters , against a lazy current that made little ripples and bubbles and sucking sounds as it ran over and around little rocks and old greenlichened snags . While I rowed , the Old Man fussed with the fishing gear . I noticed that he put a split shot and a single hook on one leader , and tied a bright red-and-white wooden lure with some pork-rind streamers on the other . We came around a bend of the Big Crick , and the Old M:ur told me to head her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pads and weeds and , it looked like , some fairly deep pools . He handed me the rod with the single hook and the little sinker on it .  | " Now , " he said sternly , " we will fish . You will use some of those worms you dug up and catch us a mess of brim . I will see if I ca n't do something about a bass or so . When you 've caught us a bait o ' brim , switch the hook and try for the bass yourself . They wo n't be bitin ' for another hour or so , anyhow , until the evening fly hatch rises . " Now , then , son , " the Old Man said , " we ai n't goin ' to talk any , because fishin ' is a silent sport and a lot of conversation scares the fish and wrecks the mood . What I want you to do is set there and fish , and when the fish ai n't bitin ' I want you to listen and look and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hereafter . Look around you and do n't take nothing for granted . Look at everything you see and listen to everything you hear , just like you were brand-new come from another world , and think about all those things and how they got there . Now let 's fish . " I threaded a big , juicy worm onto the hook and flipped the line over the side , and in less than a minute a big fat bream had seized onto it and I jerked him into the boat . They only ran about half a pound apiece , but they bit like they had n't ever seen a worm and thought it was candy . The Old Man was potting away at lily pads or close aboard them and flicking his line along the shore under overhangs of old logs or rocks , and was n't catching anything at all . I pulled in about two dozen bream , and then switched to a plug and started to imitate the Old Man . I had a little trouble with the wrist , but not much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'd learned to throw a cast net , and boys do n't have much trouble learning anything outside of ! book lessons . Nothing hit my hook either . It was just flip , reel in , poise , flip , and reel in the water like a frog kicking his legs in a breast stroke . Well , sir , when you ca n't talk , you got to think and look and listen , and all of a sudden I was the lonesomest boy in the world . You know anything about what it 's like in a fresh-water  | swamp in the South when the sun is starting to drop and the noises begin ? Or what it smells like and feels like as it cools off from the heat of the day ? And what sort of things are all around you ? I got to looking at the water . It was clear and clean , but as brown as your hat from the leaf dye , and when you scooped up a handful it tasted a little like leaves smelled if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all sorts of little things ? bugs that hopped and popped , little crawlers that left a tiny wake behind them , like a mink swimming . Fish swirled and rose to snap at the first beginnings of the fly hatch . A big bullfrog gave a loud , croaking ker-tunk ! and leaped into the water with a splash . Over on the other bank a water moccasin slithered down the greasy earth and slipped into the water without a sound . It was so lonely in that swampy river that it made you want to cry . All the sad sounds in the world suddenly started . A dove set up that woeful oo-hoo-oo-hoo-hoo across the swamp , and another one , sadder still , began to answer him back . They sounded like two old widow women swapping miseries . In the utter hush a million noises intruded . A bittern roared . A heron squawked . A kingfisher rattled . A deer snorted and barked . A bird screeched . A crow cawed . Somewhere deep in the swamp there was a growl and a scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was answered . Leaves rustled . Things fell off trees . Bushes stirred mysteriously with the passing of unseen animals . Along the creek a piece a raccoon came down to drink , washing his little paws as daintily as a lady . The sun sank lower , and the huge old live oaks , their Spanish-moss beards swaying down to the water 's edge , looked as ominous as monsters . The cypress knees made all sorts of strange shapes . Along the banks the ferns grew  --  the delicate maidenhair fern and broader-leafed ones I did n't know the names of  --  in an indescribable carpetry of cool greenness . Litt lo silly flowers poked their button heads up among the ferns .  | Away off somewhere a cowbell tinkled very sadly , and you could hear a rich Negro voice singing its way through the frightening , falling shadows of the intruding evening . He sounded scared , and he was scared , and he would n't get any less scared until he sighted his shack with the fire going under the big black iron kettle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly vocal bugs were beginning to sound their eventide notes , like an orchestra tuning for the overture . In my brain I looked at all of it  --  the trees , the grass , the moss , the bugs , the birds , the ferns , the flowers , the setting sun , the rising hatch of flies . I felt the dark creeping and saw the first shining speck of star and heard the mounting noises in the swamp . I felt cold in my bones from the rising miasma of mist as the air cooled . I was so lost in what was going on , in the million slivers of vibrant life , that when a big fish hit I lost him out of sheer panic . The bass bit beautifully , there just at dusk , and we caught ten or so between us  --  not very big ; but a two-pound bigmouth on a whippy rod is quite an order . When it got black-dark , the fish eased off and I shoved the boat into the stream and let the current carry us down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and put the plugs back in the tackle box , and I just sort of warded the scow off the snags . The Old Man lit his pipe and puffed peacefully . He said nothing , nothing at all . It was main late when we hit the landing . The stars had crept out bright now , and a little wedge of moon was slipping sneakylike up over the trees . The frogs , the bugs , the night birds , and the animals were making a din . I got to thinking about eternity , and how long something that never ended would be , and I got to thinking about how much trouble Somebody went to , to make things like cocoons that butterflies come out of , and seasons and rain and moss on trees , and frogs and fish and possums and coons and quail and flowers and ferns and water and moons and suns and stars and winds . And boys . Especially boys .  | Once we got back in the Liz , the Old Man did n't say anything for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ai n't said much . What do you feel like ? " " I feel like I been to church . I feel like I got  --  that word you said . " " Humility ? " the Old Man asked gently . " Yessir , " I said . " I feel awful little and unimportant , somehow , and a little bit scared . " " You 're beginning to learn , boy , " he said . " You 're beginning to learn . " Summertime seemed to be almost equally compounded of music and baseball . The Old Man and I used to sneak off into the woods some nights , when we could get out of the house without an argument , and just follow the singing until we came onto a big revival meeting , white , or a big camp meeting , colored , or a most amazing exhibition when the Holiness people got took down with the Sperrit , rolled and writhed in the sandspurs , foamed at the mouth , sang to Glory , and spoke in the Unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the Sperrit got a firm grip on him , he was a sight to see . He got trancified , and walled his eyes , and spoke in the Tongues , and when he really got to rolling , he did n't seem to feel the sandspurs , which were nigh about as big as golfballs , with inch-long spikes . The white revivals were a little depressing , because everybody including the preacher was full of sin and eager to admit it . People I knew well who had n't had a bad thought or committed an evil deed in forty years used to go to the bench and confess to the most amazing breaches of the peace of state and soul . I always felt like they were bragging , so as not to be left out el things . One Sunday , though , we went to the Big Town and heard Billy Sunday produce a fire-and-brimstoner under a big tent , and I was powerful impressed , possibly because the Devilhating Mr. Sunday had been a professional baseball player once . I did n't smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | tobacco , for fear of hell-and-damnation . I even gave up baseball and fishing on Sunday for a little spell . What I liked best  --  and so did the Old Man  --  were the colored folks ' camp meetings . I reckon between us we knew every Negro in the country , old and young , male and female , ornery and exemplary . They would congregate in a clearing somewhere well out of town , with a thatched shelter over the big rough pine tables where the food was , and sometimes go on for days . The camp meetings had a lot of preaching and exhorting , and a lot of casting out of Satan , and a lot of mourning on the bench , and a lot of people reborn in the Lamb , but it was all much better-natured than the white folks ' revivals . The colcored folks seemed to be on a more intimate basis with the Lord . The backsliders were there to renew faith and acquire fresh hope , but the majority of the people who made up the congregation were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the spitting of the fish in the skillet , and the grease on hands and faces in the firelight , were part of it , as the watermelons and the lard cakes and the fried chicken and the rice pilaus were part of it . There was always some homespun corn whisky , and some home-stomped scuppernong wine too , which was as much a part of the festival as the music . I heard no music like that until I went to Africa a great many years later . When I first heard the Wakambas singing the working songs , and the lifting , toting songs , and the Waluingulus putting on a nocturnal meat-thanks concert in the bright of the moon , I could close my eyes and roll back thirty years to Brunswick County 's camp meetings . The singing would start out with a formal hymn , which would gradually syncopate into a chant , and would move easily from hymn to spiritual , with the African beat becoming more pronounced . The shuffling would become a stamping , hands would clap , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies , with the firelight flickering on greaseshining black faces . The voices of the women would separate into wailing minors from the deep rich basses and baritones  | of the men . Groups of singers would stray apart , answering and asking each other questions in song , blending in the refrain , pausing at the breath stops with deep-chested grunts from the men . ( The old lion grunt is parcel to nearly all the African music I ever heard . ) From time to time one of the women would let out a piercing , neck-hair-lifting scream , and throw herself on the confession bench , as the music took her and her sins welled up , to plead for purification . When Sister Mary had enjoyed her moment of full attention , Sister Kate would throw back her head and let out a screech , and in time all the good Sistren would have their prideful moment at the bench . Old Satan used to take a fearful beating . The men very rarely were taken , but provided the constant chant . A good bass singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as popular as the preacher in terms of chocolate cake , fried chicken , and free access to the fruit jar . I remember the Old Man spotting a strange face in the crowd once , and asking the man where he came from , and why he was there . The man smiled , understanding our rather peculiar patriarchal attitude . " Ah comes from Onslow County . Ah come heah to drink whisky and sing bass , " he replied in a voice that would have made patil Robeson sound like a soprano . This fellow was very popular with the younger female set , and usually disappeared from view around midnight . We never mixed into the festivities , of course , but sat at the edges , and were tolerated because we were the Cap 'm and the Little Cap 'm , and because my mammy , Aunt Laura , had been born a slave and wore a conjure bag until the day she died . We were kind of part of the family . From time to time somebody would fetch us a dipper of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field peas with fatback . It was a mutually understood laissez-faire ; the same shining ( ) lack faces could be seen on the outskirts of the dancing when the white folks had their big square dances  --  interestedly watch ing the high jinks as the bokra ( white people ) leaped and cavorted and kicked their heels and sashayed in time to the  | fiddles . And I must say that a white-folks ' Saturday night square dance , for action , might have made a Masai ngoma look tame , once the sweaty dancers got sufficiently lubricated on the white corn that burned a path down the gullet and landed with a fiery thump in the pit of the stomach . White music or black , summertime created a lot of vocal exercise , a power of banjo plinking and fiddle sawing . The baseball was another thing entirely . The Old Man bought me a glove , a ball , a catcher 's mitt , and a bat , which kind of gave me a corner on the two-o ' - cat market . We pitched and caught interminably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was simply called " The Grove . " We batted flies and rapped grounders on the one stretch of sidewalk in the town . This was perishing hard on the ball , which soon became scuffed , frayed its seams , and peeled its horsehide . The ball was then wrapped in bicycle tape , and landed in the glove with a leaden thump that like to have torn your hand off . Walter Johnson was the big hero among the pitchers , and Babe Ruth was becoming so popular they named a candy bar after him . We , at least , promptly gave up O. Henry for Baby Ruth . Pictures of the stars came in cigarette and candy packages , just like the movie stars , and very brisk trading went on . Saturday was the day of the big game between the town 's pickup adult team and one of the surrounding hamlets . This game actually had as many as nine men on a side , and the catcher not only owned a " mast , " we called it , but a belly protector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a fellow named Fred Something played a fancy left-handed first base , and the two St. George boys , Donald and Bill , were the battery . They said that if Donald had n't fooled around too much , and drunk a little too much corn , he could have pitched in the majors . I suppose there is always one man in every town who could have made the majors if he had n't fooled around too much . Saturday night in the summertime was when they swept the  | small fry off the streets early , because the rival teams had a way of canceling hostilities by burying their noses in the same jug , and by midnight were apt to be burying blunt instruments in each other 's skulls . The word would go out that Tom or Joe or Bill " was drinking " ? they always used that phrase , " was drinking " ? and sisters and mothers and aunts would hustle out like agitated setter dogs to retrieve their wayward kith and kinry . The fathers were known weaklings , and sometimes two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; father and son wrapped in each other 's arms and either fighting or singing lugubriously . We were not , as I recall , a breed of social sippers in that day and age . When a man got his face stuck into a fruit jar , he kept it there until paralysis set in . The Old Man said that he approved of baseball because it was the only neat sport he knew of  --  three strikes , out ; four balls , walk ; fair and foul clearly marked ; over the fence , a homer ; just so far around the bases ; and always the same distance from the pitcher 's block to the plate . But he did not approve of the wassail-all which followed the games , and his heart nigh broke when the Black Sox scandals came to light . He reckoned among other things that there had been too much postgame drinking mixed up in it , and that was in some indirect way responsible for this breakdown of moral fiber in Chicago . Yet there never was a man who liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just felt that if you were hunting , you were supposed to hunt , and a cockle-warmer came at the end , not in the middle of it . Same way about fishing , work , or baseball . He made an exception in camp meetings , recognizing that alcoholic incentive was part of the festivity . There was a kind of unwritten rule in our town that nobody was supposed to have any fun on Sunday , but was to stay home , eat an enormous dinner , and spend the afternoon bored and half-drugged from the monumental midday meal . The Old Man took heavy exception to this . He said he had been clean through the Good Book , and while he admitted that it came  | out strong against working on the Sabbath , he could n't see anything wrong in a man translating his day of rest any way it pleased him , so long as it did n't constitute a nuisance or offend other people 's delicate sensibilities . At this time there were very few privately owned automobiles , and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Model T or the Locomobile and go for a grueling expedition called " the Sunday afternoon ride . " For a youngster it was torture , packed in with the old folks and the musty smell of jet-beaded black funeral silk which constituted old ladies ' Sunday uniform . That 's when we would slip quietly away after dinner and go fishing . " The fish do n't know if it 's Sunday or Wednesday , " the Old Man said . " It 's all the same to a fish . So long as we are not catching fish for sale , which constitutes work , I reckon we are leaving the Sabbath intact according to formal rules . It certainly is n't any worse than racketing around in a car , or spending the afternoon playing this golf everybody 's getting so crazy about , or just setting around the house trying to stay awake . " We never took very much trouble with Sunday fishing . If somebody else wanted the Liz , we just ambled down to the water , scooped up a mess of fiddler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the big sheepsheads to come out from their caverns around the rotted , barnacle-encrusted pilings . You caught more toadfish than sheepsheads , but occasionally there was a small blackfish to relieve the monotony . Now and again we shoved the skiff off the shingle and rowed half a mile or so to some holes we knew , close by an ancient wreck , stopping by the marsh on the way to net a few shrimp for bait . There was always a mess of croakers and the occasional weakfish to liven up the afternoon . Sometimes we just took the crab net and a piece of ancient meat and went crabbing off of one of the little piers . Or we 'd rig up a light and a trident and pole the boat around after dark on low tide , stabbing the odd flounder . If  | the car was n't working for somebody else , we might drive a few miles to one of the big fresh-water cricks and have a try at a few largemouthed bass when the evening cooled . No , I reckon there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it got to be September before you knew it , with the big salt-water fish beginning to run , and the high , moonswollen tides to make the marsh-hen shooting easy on the first big norther . And then the tortures of school and shoes began , and before very long the frosts had crinkled the persimmons and the hound dogs started running the woods by night , with quail and Christmas just around the corner . But I still ca n't hear that " Summertime " song without fetching up the Old Man , as large as life , despite all he said about summers belonging to boys and the old folks standing aside . I reckoned for most of his days the Old Man figured he was a kind of overgrown boy himself .  | 12 September Song ? 11 Even for a young ruffian like me , getting back to school in September was a little bit of fun for a few days . You saw a lot of people you had n't seen for three months , and the football practice was starting . In class there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moved in from some other town . There would be a couple of new boys , too , and it took a bit of time and a fist fight after school to squeeze ' em into the pattern . This was a pretty good September . Through some sort of accident I skipped a grade and was now a senior in grammar school  --  practically grown , I thought . There was a very pretty blonde girl named Rose Ellen sitting next to me , and I fell in love the first day . This did n't mean much because I 'd started falling in love in kindergarten and had two or three scizurcs  | every year from that point on . I carried a mess of books in those days . I was kind of in love double that year , because we had a redheaded , freckle-faced young sprout of a teacher named Miss Carrie Mae Knight , who was a real humdinger . You hear a lot about juvenile delinquents these days , but I 'm here to tell you that if every classroom had a Carrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with kids . You never saw such a woman as this Knight female . Mind you , she was teaching a class that had boys in it older than she was , because she was only nineteen , and some of those big country kids were easily twenty . They got in one grade and just stayed . Miss Carrie Mae Knight could do nearly anything we did better than we could . She coached the football team . She scandalized the principal by putting on pants and showing a great big clunk named Clyde Something how to really take a tackle out of play , and she rattled his teeth when she hit him . She could play any position on the baseball team , and when she pitched she came in with a high hard one that bore no resemblance to the crooked-arm way that most girls throw . She never sent any ratty notes to your folks about whatever deviltry you 'd been up to , and she never squealed to the principal or shifted her disciplinary responsibilities , which wo called " being sent to the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even when some big oaf she was keeping after school made a grown-up grab at her . She killed her own snakes . She hit him a punch in the chin with a straight left and crossed with her right , and never had any more trouble . I seem to remember that she had been raised with five brothers , all red . headed . Carrie Mae  --  we called her Carrie Mae outside the classroom ? had a big following at the parties , when we played kissing games , like post office and spin-the-bottle . She seemed to know instinctively how to hang onto kids , boys and girls . She was  | taking flying lessons , and she used to give us a half-hour fill-in on her progress  --  in the middle of the study period . She read to us a full hour every day . It was never kid stuff , either . She read a lot of Mark Twain and Kipling and contemporary stuff from the magazines . To the best of my memory , nobody ever made a paper airplane or threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those natural-born readers who could lift you out of your seat . She even read us Shakespeare and made it sound like a Wild West story , and I still get hungry when I remember the first time I ever heard her read Charles Lamb 's dissertation on roast pig . I knew about cracklin ' ; I 'd been raised on it . Carrie Mae was the first real contact I made with the outside world of adults . Of course the Old Man and some of his shooting and fishing friends were sort of buddies of mine , and I did n't think of them so much as grown-ups . I had a lot of adult friends among the fishermen and the Negro field hands and suchlike , but teachers and people like them were all enemies , guilty until proved innocent . What really sold me on Carrie Mae was the day the Old Man drove up to the school and asked for me about ten o'clock in the morning . Miss Knight went out to see what the old gentleman wanted , and then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her out into the hall . The Old Man was in the lobby , twisting his hat in his hands . " Your grandfather , " Carrie Mae said , " has got a crisis . He has explained to me that this is the day the dove season opens and he just got a message from a friend of his that there 's a big dove drive taking place , away off in the other end of Brunswick County . He says that he does n't think the entire progress of education would be ruined if I excused you from the rest of the classes today to go along with him . He 's also asked me to dinner to eat some of the doves . You better run along . I 'll need about two hours ' help with some papers tomorrow afternoon , and you can pay me back then . "  | That was as close as I ever came to kissing a teacher , un several years later , of course . I made my manners and roa down the hall like a train with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " That 's quite a filly , " he said . " If I was about forty-odd ye younger , I 'd choose her up myself . She 's reasonable . A reason able redheaded woman is hard to come by . Let 's us go she some doves . " The Old Man had the guns and little Mickey , a golden cock that I have n't told you about yet . Mickey was of the old cocke breed  --  pretty near as big as a springer , and an all-round hunting dog . She had hair about the color of Miss Knight 's , and she had a good flat head and a square muzzle like a dog , not like some of the popeyed , pointed-headed idiots they call cockers today . They 've bred all the sense out of most cockers and made sissy dogs out of them , but there was a time when a good cocker would rassle a bear and hunt anything that flew , ran , or climbed . We drove across the river on Mr. Oscar Durant 's old ferryboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willem farm , a big corn , cotton , and tobacco holding . The roads were made of corrugated clay , and it took time . We had plenty of time to get there for the afternoon shooting unless the Liz decided to throw a shoe . As we bumped along , the Old Man was lecturing a little bit , as he generally did when we took on a new subject . " Doves , " the Old Man began , " are the easiest hard shootin ' in the world . Or maybe it 's the other way around . Maybe they 're the toughest easy shootin ' in the world . I 'm telling you right now , you figger to miss more'n you hit , and it would n't surprise me none if you did n't hit any for your first box o ' shells . " A cranked-up dove that 's been driven is as fast and tricky as any bird in the world . He 'll swoop like a swallow , and he 'll change his flight pattern just when you start to pull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  than a feather-tick mattress . When he 's going away , you can shoot off his tail and pull a  | and of fluff off him , and he 'll still continue on his errand. deleted paragraph We finally got to the farm , and there were twenty or twentyfive men standing around in the clean-swept sandy front yard under the chinaberry tree , smoking pipes and chewing tobacco and spitting meditatively at targets . They all had guns , mostly rusty-looking old pumps and a few wire-wrapped single-barrels . There was a general air of festivity and an odor of crushed grain that was not unfamiliar . They all said a hearty Hello to the Old Man and tossed a few jokes at me , such as , " Are you sure it 's safe to hunt in the same field with this feller , Ned ? " Or " Can we trust him not to kill all the birds and leave a few for us ? That looks like a mighty potent hawgleg he 's carrying , do n't it ? " Then they would slap their blue-jeaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season was a kind of community party , like a house raising or a cane grinding or a quilting bee . The Old Man laid a hand on my neck and said , " Do n't you worry about this feller . He 'll wipe all of your eyes when he gets the hang of it . I 'm here now . What 're we waiting for ? Let 's go shoot some doves . " It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when we started to trudge out to the stubble field , a huge cornfield that must have been a mile across and two miles long . I had two boxes of shells for the 16-gauge . The Old Man said I 'd need ' em . The cocker spaniel trailed along behind us , as though she knew what she was doing .  | We came to a far corner of the field , and the Old Man pointed to a big hickory tree with some old dogfennel bushes under it . " Sort of scrootch down here , " he said . " I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry drive . The dog'lI stay with you . Just tell her to fetch , if so be it there 's anything to fetch . " And the Old Man laughed loud ? " Haw-haw " ? and stalked off to crisscross the field , driving up the doves . All those grown men were strung out around the edges of the field , partly hidden by trees or clumps of bush . Half a dozen were driving , and pretty soon you could see the doves whistling up , aimless at first , but working up steam as they got higher and leveled off . Then the guns started to go off , boom-boom here , boom-boom there , and now and again you 'd see a swiftly darting dove crumple in a puff of feathers and drop like a brick , or slant or flutter down in a long glide . The late sun was bright on their rosy breasts when a few came my way , and I tried to remember about leading ' ern enough , and hauled down . I made quite a lot of noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doves , because as the guns spoke all round the field they crisscrossed back and forth , flying higher and faster , darting more , dipping more , swerving and looping more . I shot . And shot . And shot , until the barrel . were hot . Mickey , the cocker , looked up at me with a slight frown . I had two birds on the ground  --  both straightaway shot%% with no leadoff involved  --  when I scrabbled for more shells , There were n't any more in the first box . I had shot twenty-five times and had two birds and maybe a couple of possiblcs that the dogs would pick up later . Ten shells later I had four birds on the ground  --  one killed coming straight at me , the other quartering away . And then ? little machine clicked in my head , and the lead-off angl worked themselves out . I was leading passing birds as much twenty or twenty-five feet , and they were coming down like hailstones . I was nailing incoming birds , and they were falling  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursing dog language , but she was cursing at overwork . When I fired the fiftieth shell , there were fourteen birds on the ground under the tree ; and my muscle was black and blue and red from the kick . I felt pretty pleased . I had knocked down ten doves out of the last fifteen shells , and some I had shot at twice . I stuffed the birds in my old canvas hunting jacket , picked up the gun , and headed off across the field . It was getting a little nippy , and the sun was red in the face and headed for bed . I reckoned the persimmons would be ripe in another month or so ? and then it would n't be too long before the quail season started . The Old Man was sitting on the running board of a car ? cars had running boards in those days  --  and holding forth on something or other . I walked into the yard and inside-outed my hunting coat . The birds tumbled out , and the Old Man looked smug at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' cm said , " I would n't be surprised if he ai n't set a record . " He was kidding , of course , because nobody paid much attention to bags on doves in those days . " Like I said , " the Old Man remarked as we drove bumpily home , " it 's the easiest hard shooting or the toughest easy shooting in the world . When you get it figured out , it 's a cinch , but the figgerin ' costs an awful lot of gunpowder before you 'll admit that these things need all the leadoff you can crank into your head . The last ones come so easy you wonder how you missed the first ones  --  until next time , and then you wonder all over again . " I must say , though , " the Old Man said as we turned into home , " once you 've got a dove on the ground , your troubles are over . You can breathe on ' em and the feathers will fall off . Suppose you go try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mae Knight came over to the house for supper the next evening , and she ate three doves all by herself . She said she had never enjoyed any birds quite so much , because  | there were so few shot in them . I expect that Miss Carrie Mae Knight was righter than she knew . I reckon the Old Man was about as queer as they come , a stickler for a whole lot of things that might n't make much sense to other people . It was as if he had figured out a whole complete set of rules and regulations , according to his own ideas , which were good enough for him . You could do two things : you could play it his way , or you did n't play at all . " I am an old boar coon , " he told me one time . " I 'm too old and sot in my ways to learn a mess of new teachin ' . I have seen the elephant and heard the owl . I do n't do nothin ' I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people , but it suits me , because I have tried it all and made two mistakes for every mistake I did n't make . I am what you might call a monument to trial and error . " The Old Man had a lot of peculiar hates . He could n't abide a loud talker , for one thing . He said a man that had to holler for emphasis was just echoing the wind that blew through the vacant space where his brains ought to be . He especially hated noise in the woods , particularly people that were always hollering at dogs . He said it not only confused the dog but confused him as well . It made him nervous . He was a garrulous old man , and he loved to talk at length when talking had some point . But he purely despised idle chitter-chatter , people that just talked without having anything to say . And he hated to be interrupted . " The world , " he used to say , " is full of fine fragmentary thoughts , killed at birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man hated what he called uppity people , young and old alike . He had no time for a smart aleck . His friends were simple people that knew what they knew and kept their traps closed about things they did n't know . He hated discussions at the table , arguments , and problems and such . They interfered with his digestion . About the first thing I remember he ever said to me , when I was a very small boy , was that chile  | dren should be seen and not heard at the table . This went for most adults too . But he was a stickler for politeness . He claimed there was no excuse for impoliteness . He said that " sir " and " please " and " thank you , ma'am " were as cheap as dirt , and that ordinary good manners were a measure of the man , because only a dodlimbed fool was rude when he did n't have to be . It was a long time ago , but I remember just as clear that one day when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **26;64;TOOLONG . This Willie was one of those rich Yankees who had come into port with his ocean-going yacht . Ile had on a yachting cap and a double-breasted blue coat and white pants and pipe-clayed white shoes . There were another man and three women with him , and from the way they were carrying on in the stern sheets of that yacht they had been punishing the booze pretty frequent for some time . Between sunburn and whisky , the **26;92;TOOLONG had a face like a beet , more purple than red . I do n't even know what the ruckus was about . I think it was something about the yacht being sloppily moored at a private pier that belonged to the Pilots ' Association , and the yacht was beating up the pilot launch . The Old Man had some interest in the association , the pier , and the launch . I believe he asked the Willie if he would kindly nurse his yacht around to another slip or sling his hook a little farther out so as to take up a little strain , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it kindly . He came bustling up on the pier , like he was about to pop , and started to holler and wave his arms . He said , playing it big for the womenfolk , that no old moss-backed yokel was going to tell him what to do with his yacht , and that if the Old Man did n't watch his step he 'd buy the town , and so forth . The Old Man just stated his request over again , in a very mild voice , using " please " and " sir . " The Willie blew up . " Why , you old son of a bitch , " using that Truman term which does n't get you very far in an argument down South , " I 've got a good mind to  | Which was as far as he got , good mind or not . The Old Man . who was a good twenty to thirty years older , squared off and clouted him on the chin . The Willie staggered back and fell off the dock into the drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Willie was about half coaled out , and he was flopping and spluttering in the water . The Old Man hopped onto the pilot boat and grabbed a boat hook . He grappled the Willie in the seat of his flannel britches and hauled him aboard , choking and gasping like a big fish , and then being sick to his stomach . The Old Man never even looked at him . He hopped back onto the dock and bowed to the women . " I wish to beg your pardon , ladies , " he said . " I found the gentleman 's language offensive in front of the ladies . Please accept my apologies . " Then he turned to the other man . " And now , sir , " he said , " for the last time , move that boat . Please . " When we left the dock , the city slickers and the three women were moving the boat . The Old Man muttered all the way home that he despised brawls , but there occasionally came a time and a place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad manners with worse manners . " There ai n't anything , " he said , " that 'll settle an argument as fast as a punch in the nose if you know you 're right and the other feller knows he 's wrong . But it sure is undignified . " The Old Man was strictly a shark on good manners in the woods . I have already told you how persnickety he was about cleaning up campsites and burying rubbish and washing down boats and keeping guns and gear clean and oiled . But he would n't hunt or fish with a meat hog or a rude man . He used to shoot quail quite a lot with a man named Joe , a very pleasant fellow until you took him to the woods and let loose a couple of bird dogs . Then Joe changed coats and because a hog . He was one of those fast walkers , always right on the heels of the dog when it was working game . He was a fast shooter , too . A bird would get up , clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time to let the bird straighten out , and just as you were about to pull down , pow ! Joe 's gun would go off and the bird would fall , because Joe was a very fine shot . I went along on a few hunts with Joe and the Old Man , not shooting , because the one thing the Old Man was adamant about was more than two guns loaded when you were hunting quail . Even not shooting , just watching Joe made me nervous as a fox in a forest fire . It made the dogs nervous too , because Joe was stepping on their tails all the time , and they did n't have a chance to work the birds properly . The dogs rushed the birds , and the birds flushed wild , and always there was Joe , right smack in the middle of the wild birds . Even on steady points this Joe was a hog . Although they supposedly took turns on singles points , you 'd never be surprised to see your bird drop before you shot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think you were going to shoot , " or , " I thought that palmetto bush had blocked off your bird . " The Old Man was deadly with his gun , but he never brought in more than half the birds Joe did . I noticed a lot of things . Every time they did get confused and both fired at the same bird , Joe would take the bird from the dog and put it in his pocket  --  even though it was the Old Man 's turn . And when they got home , if Joe had fifteen and the Old Man had six , Joe would keep the fifteen , and there would be no mention of a divvy . Finally the Old Man quit hunting with Joe . He said it took all the fun out of shooting . " Hunting ai n't a competition , " he said . " You ai n't trying to win any prizes . Hunting is watching the dog work , and taking it easy , and shooting just enough , and walking slow , and enjoying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races at my age , not if I never fire off another shotgun . And if a man wants a bird more than I do , he can have him . But not in my steady company . " So the Old Man and I took to hunting regularly together , and we killed about as many birds as Joe did , but we killed  | them according to ordinary politeness and what the Old Man called protocol . We did it calm and easy . When the dogs would point a covey , I would stand to the left and the Old Man would take the right . If all the birds swung my way , he never shot . If they went his way , I let ' em go , and hoped a lay bird would jump up in front of me . Most of the time one did . On single birds , we shot turn and turn about . If two birds got up when it was my turn , the Old Man never shot at all . He only shot if half a dozen jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 18o degrees from where I was pointing . Quite a lot of birds got away from us , in one sense , but then quite a lot did n't . For one thing , knowing that you did n't have to compete with some itchy trigger behind you or on one side of you calmed you down . You 'd let the bird fly and straighten out and kill him dead , rather than snap-shoot him and either miss him clean or blow him to pieces with the full charge . And the difference it made in the dogs was unbelievable . The Old Man was n't wrong when he said a nervous hunter can make even a good dog nervous , to where he starts crowding the bird and flushing him or running clean over a lay bird that he would have smelled if he 'd been taking his time . I reckon we more than made up for the ones that got away with the ones we shot that we would n't even have suspected of being there if we 'd been in a hurry . After we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs had retrieved , the Old Man would generally sit down under a tree , call in the dogs , and light his pipe . " Let 's give ' em a little time , " he 'd say . " It 'll take those singles ten minutes before they start to move around a bit and leave enough scent for the dogs to smell ' em out . A bird that 's just hit the ground do n't have hardly any smell at all . He has to move a little first . " Well , I learned something there , too . If you go crowding and stomping right into where you 've seen the single light , you 'll kick up bird after bird that the dogs have run smack over , especially if it 's in thick grass . Lots of times the birds will get up again as a covey , or as two halves of a covey . Or if they 've  | lit in sparse cover , they 'll flush wild , whereas if you 'd left ' em alone a little they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent for the dogs to follow , and you 'd have gotten a stanch point and a good shot . By just leaving them alone ten or fifteen minutes , when you did go to roust ' em out you 'd have your dogs pointing a bird here , a bird there , two birds here , and each bird holding hard on the ground , even with the guns going off . The way the Old Man hunted singles , there was many a time we could have wiped out the covey , excepting that the Old Man did n't hold with shooting more than three or four birds apiece out of any one bunch . I sat down one winter  --  we always kept strict account of the birds we brought in , and filed a report to the Game Department at the end of the year  --  and figured out an average bag for the pair of us . There was a fifteen-bird limit then , and we averaged twenty-one birds per hunting day for two guns . I missed a lot of birds , and I averaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rain and snow and dry-nosed , sick dogs and just plain bad-luck days , we had to have a lot of days when we killed the limit , fifteen birds apiece . But the important thing was that we had plenty of lovely time in between the actual shooting . So suppose it took us all afternoon to get a limit or a near limit ? We had just that much more time in the woods , to see all the things a man can see in the woods if he 's traipsing along slow and easy and taking his time . There 's no fun going hunting at three o'clock if you 're going to be back in the tin Liz at four-thirty , with the best part of the day still ahead of you . In later years it seemed to me that this feller Joe missed all the important part of hunting , just from being in a hurry and greedy to see a little bundle of feathers fall . The Old Man said that hunting was not so much what you brought home in the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a small return on your original investment . " Otherwise , " he said , " you might as well build yourself a  | quail trap or take a couple dollars and buy a gross from one of these pot hunters . There just ai n't enough meat on a bobwhite partridge to make it worth while to turn yourself into what that **26;120;TOOLONG called me . I would rather come home any time with a few birds and a good day in the woods . " The Old Man was peculiar , all right . I wish there were more of his brand around these days . Maybe we 'd have more birds .  | 13 Even School Ca n't Hurt October It being Prohibition in those days , I had no way of knowing what brown October ale tasted like , but there were a passel of other things to recommend the month . I 'm not referring to school , and wearing shoes again , because by October you 'd got used to about six hours of torture and your feet had quit hurting . ctober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oysters were prime again , and there was enough leaf off the trees so that you could see a squirrel . The big fish were beginning to run , rind the first frosts had come , so that a fire felt fine in the evenings . And if October were here , why then it was n't so long before the bird season opened , and once you had Thanksgiving settled you had Christmas practically made . It was one of those nice bright Saturdays when it forgot to  | rain . Speaking of rain , did you ever notice that for five schooldays the sun always shone , but as soon as a boy got loose from learning and fixed his mouth to do something worth while with his time on a Saturday , it always poured rain ? Anyhow , this was one of those nice bright Saturdays , or promised to be , because the sun had just come up blood-red and was starting to turn gold , and the first mild frost was white and stiff on the browning grass , and there was n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Old Man had parked the Liz , and we were walking down a corduroy country road , heading for a big hickory grove we knew about . We were carrying a couple of .22 rifles and were accompanied by that five dog , Jackie , the mongrel with the curled tail that swooped up in the air and came back to rest approximately between his shoulder blades . Jackie was dirty yellow and had a fox 's face , and nobody could have accused him of having a hound 's bugle , but there was one thing Jackie could do better than any other dog in the world . If there was a squirrel in a tree or rooting for nuts on the ground , Jackie would know about it , and tell you about it in a thin little voice that sounded like an angry woman quarreling . " We 'll just tie this masterpiece of bad breeding to a tree for a spell , " the Old Man said . " All the squirrels are still in the trees , and we do n't need no expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will still-hunt ' em a spell . I reckon there 's enough leaves off so we can see ' em . " We came into the hickory grove . It was as still as a cemetery . " A great morning for squirrels , " the Old Man whispered . " It 's a waste of time to hunt them in the wind . They just do n't move , and they do n't feed much . Be quiet now , and let 's wal soft and go sit under that big hickory yonder and see wh happens . Ssshh . " We sat down , the Old Man on one side of the tree and me o the other . All over the grove you could hear the squirrels hcgi to talk . Chirr is about as close as you could come to the noise they make , but you can make about the same sound by sliding  | your tongue sideways across the top of your mouth . There was plenty of action going on this morning , I must say . You could hear them chirring all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the nuts , and now and again you would hear a mild crash in the foliage as a big fellow traded trees and the branch he sailed off of would whip back . I heard a chirr behind me on the ground , and a click , and I knew it was the Old Man talking squirrel . He was making the click with his safety . It sounded just like a squirrel bragging about the size of the nut he was tackling . Pretty soon there was a shaking in the branches of a tree just ahead of me , off to the right , and I sat still as a statue . Then there was some more shaking , and a head stuck out of a crotch . All I could see was head , but it was black-silver and it had to be a fox squirrel . Bimebye I saw a tail flicker , and then the old fox slid round the trunk , flat-plastered to the bole . I let him come all the way round until his back was to me and he was peeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .22 real slow , held high on his back between the shoulders , and squeezed her off , The long rifle hit with a thump , and Mr. Squirrel came down like a rock . He hit with a thud , kicked a couple of times , and quit . A soft-nosed .22 long rifle between the shoulders will make a man stop and think , let alone an old squirrel . From where this fellow lay , he looked as big as a tomcat . He was near solid black on top , with a lovely black-and-gray tail , and he was almost three times as big as a gray , or what we call a cat squirrel . It was n't long before I heard a rustling behind me , then a wait , and the Old Man 's little gun spat . I heard a thump as something hit the deck , and judged the Old Man 's gun eye was st ill working . With the Old Man making his chittering noise , the squirrels came to that big hickory like they were cats and we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little splat ! , followed by tunk ! as the bullet hit , and blump ! as the squirrel came tumbling down . There were mostly grays , but I acquired two more of the fox variety , one a lovely silver-gray and  | the other blacker than the first . The Old Man 's gun was speaking pretty constant , too , and in less than an hour we had more than a dozen . Then I heard the Old Man creak to his feet and heard the rasp of a match as he fired up his pipe . " Let 's pick up and move on . We done wore out our welcome here . How many you got ? " he asked . " Seven , " I told him . " Three foxes and four cats . How ' bout you ? " " I got eight , " the Old Man said , " but only one fox . I missed another I coulda killed with a rock , if I had of had a rock instead of this cannon . " " I missed three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to hit one jumping , and the other two I coulda caught with my hands . A squirrel looks like a mighty big target when he 's flattened out or sitting up , do n't he ? " We had a couple of towsacks with us , and I filled mine with my squirrels . Then I went around to where the Old Mart had stacked his squirrels in a neat pile , and dumped ' em on top of mine . Fifteen squirrels in one sack is a powerful mess o squirrels . It was all I could do to heft the bag . " Gim me , " the Old Man said . " I 'll just hang it up here ii this low crotch , whilst you go let Jackie loose . It do n't do to frustrate a dog , any more than you 'd tease a young'un . He 's been hearing the gun go off , and he 's probably hung himself by now . We can still use a lot more squirrels . I promised a iiucsl to half the neighborhood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young'uns to feed , and the boa weevils hit the cotton this year . " I grinned . The Old Man was powerful cute somerim Abner McCoy was as black as the ace of spades and he had mouth as big as a scoop shovel . He farmed a lot of land next the store , and he had more quail than anybody round . Alin a dozen fat squirrels would make a prime bait of meat for h family , and there would be enough heads left over for a pro squirrel-head stew . The squirrels would fix our hunting lc for another year .  | There may have been a limit on squirrels in those days  --  I disremember  --  but we did n't hunt ' em much , and when we hunted we hunted serious . So I rested my gun on my hat and trotted off to unleash Jackie , who was having a fit of nervous frustration and was foaming at the mouth . He nigh dragged me off my feet as we headed back to the grove . " Turn him loose now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over yonder to that rise where all the scrubby oaks and chinquapins are . The survivors 'll be on the ground . That 's Jackie 's business . " Jackie took off in the right direction , and presently we heard his squirrel-up-a-tree signal , a feverish yapping that would make you think he 'd treed a panther or a bear , at least . He was standing under an oak  --  did I say standing ? He was dancing an Irish reel and yipping his head off , with his sharp fox face pointing to heaven . " You take that side , " the Old Man said . " I 'll take this . In a minute one of us will spot him . " Shooting treed squirrels is almost ridiculously simple . It is just a matter of knowing how to look for ' em . With two men to a tree , the squirrel , who is plastered to the trunk or squatting in a crotch or stretched full length on a branch , will move away from one side as soon as he is aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy on the other side shoots him . Pretty soon I spotted a head sticking cautiously around the bole , and a gray body , stuck flat , eased around to my side . The little .22 talked some more , and down he came . Jackie raced over , picked him up by the back of the neck , gave him a sharp twist , and broke his neck . Then Jackie spat him out on the ground , barked a sharp bark of self-appreciation , and whipped off . It went on like that until nearly eleven o'clock . I reckon Jackie must have netted us another two dozen squirrels , mostly rats , but at least six or seven more foxes . We filled the other bag , and it was so heavy that the Old Man ran a stick through  | a couple of holes in the hem , and we packed it out together . When we got to Abner 's , the Old Man dumped the first bag in Abner 's clean , white-sanded front yard . Abner 's vast , plumblack face split in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Man , dat sure a bait o ' skwull , " Abner said . " What in de yudder crocusack ? " " More squirrels , " the Old Man told him . " These fifteen are for you . " " Bossman , dat powerful neighborly . Us kin use some meat in dis house . Seem lak every day I count another young'un I did n't know us had , and de price o ' sowbelly powerful high . Tell you what us best do , " Abner said . " Dat too many skwull in de yudder sack for two people clean . I call my biggest chillun , and we set right down here and skin ' em now . You chillun ! Come hope me and de Cap 'm ! " Children of all sizes boiled from the little house . " You , Woodrow Wilson , you go fotch de knives ! " Abner ordered . " You , Hardin ' , you go tell Mama I say start de fiah and boil water in de hog-killin ' pot . You just makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dat chinkyberry tree , while de chillun fix de skwull . And if I ai n't outa my station , Cap 'm , maybe you like a little snort of somepin I found in de branch las ' week , and de young Cap 'm , maybe he like cool he th'oat with a little dipper scuppernong wine , yeddy ? " The Old Man said he could n't think of a sounder idea . We sat in the shade , and Abner brought a half-gallon Mason jar full of white liquid , and a similar jar half-full of a darker liquid . The white liquid was sweet and cool from the well , and the brown liquid must have had plenty muscles in it , because the Old Man closed his eyes and his body contorted when he downed a dipperful . He wiped his mustaches with the back of his hand . " How are the birds this year , Abner ? " he asked . " Never seen so many patridges in my life , " Abner replied . " City man out here de yudder day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him I save my buhds for my white folks . "  | The Old Man looked at me and winked . It was n't long before our two dozen squirrels , skinned , gutted , and washed , came pink and clean in the tow sack . " I guess we better get on , Abner , and many thanks , " the Old Man said . " Good-by . " Abner said good-by , and the chillun waved . The Old Man drove slowly out of the yard . He turned and winked at me again . " There 's more ways to kill a cat than to choke it to death on butter . " I reckon you all think I 'm powerful concerned with food , because I 'm always writing about it . I guess I 've got to plead guilty , but it seems to me a boy lives mostly in his belly , and the Old Man said one time he did n't trust nobody that did n't like to eat so hearty that a nap was bounden necessary after Sunday dinner . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbecue rigs , with the host wearing a girl 's apron and a chef 's cap . Mostly what got cooked was cooked inside a house , on a slowburning wood stove , by a slow-cooking colored lady who did n't want nobody messin ' round her kitchen . The men did n't cook ? least the men did n't cook public in town . But the sneaky spirit of the chef was always there , inside the hairiest of the roughnecks , and Christmas was a time of year when everybody who was n't sweet as a peach ( a Southport euphemism for being as drunk as a goat ) was apt to be doing something in the woods or on the water . It was a kind of point of honor to go somewhere to spend a couple of days living off the land . They still have them in my part of the South , but they 've got a lot fancier now , and I 'm talking about the old-fashioned oyster roasts . A roast was as much a part of the festive season as the Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In these outdoor cooking sprees , the men mostly took over . The ladies had their hands floury enough from making the fruitcakes , and they just sort of sat back , patted a foot , and let the boys be boys .  | The first thing the boys did was go out in a skiff and tong up a bait of oysters and clams . The oysters in that neck of the woods were mighty fine . They were big  --  big as a bar of laundry soap  --  gray , striated , and shading to white around their wrinkled edges . The clams were nearly as big as tennis balls , purple-black on the shell and a plum-yellow solid globe on the inside . They came up muddy from the cold gray water , and when you swished the tongs in the clean water they tumbled onto the deck of the boat shining bright as jewels . The fruits of the sea were taken to a proper oyster shed , which meant a lean-to under which a rough wooden table perched on trestles ; the chairs were anything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light  --  I forgot to say that no respectable oyster roast was held in the daytime . It was not considered polite to get drunk in daylight , and a good portion of our holidaymakers considered oysters and corn liquor inseparable . Wet-down moss would do , but a really top-grade oyster chef smothered his oysters in freshly gathered kelp . The actual oven was a simple compromise on a modern barbecue apparatus , meaning that three sides of stone or concrete held a sheet of heavy tin or galvanized iron on top . A slow fire was built under the metal sheet , and the oysters , blanketed in seaweed , were allowed to steam until the hinges relaxed and you could slide an oyster knife between the shell lips without cutting the valve . The smell is still vivid to me , because the oyster roast was held close by salt marsh , the scent of marsh and myrtle and beach pine mingling with the steam from the roaster . You were supposed to tee off with either clam chowder or terrapin stew ; you never got both at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was very simple . The chowder contained no milk or tomatoes . It had clam juice and clams and diced Irish potatoes and browned fatback and onions and salt and pepper , and it simmered into such a delicious symphony that you had to hold yourself back , remembering the oysters . One of the ladies generally bestirred herself to make the chowder , for  | the gentlemen were always very busy with the oysters and with the half-gallon fruit jars that contained a white beverage which was known simply as mule . But the oysters were the main operation . The chowder just paved your stomach for the real debauch . I do n't care how they eat oysters today ; there 's only one way . As the Old Man said sometimes , " I value your opinion , but not when I know better . And in this case I know better . " First you take a bushel of oysters , smoky steam writhing , from their bed in the kelp over the slow coals , and you introduce them to a small Negro boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . In front of you , on the rough pine planking of the table , is a bowl of red-hot melted butter and a wide , empty plate  --  almost platter size . For a condiment there is a thin-necked jug of pepper vinegar , with the little curled-up red peppers , hot as Hades , still inside . There is a platter full of johnnycake , corndodgers , or even hushpuppies in front of you . For a beverage , you drink Bevo , a concoction that was supposed to taste like beer but wanting a little needle to gain authority . At the signal " Go ! " the colored boy starts to open oysters , and if you are a man of control and high purpose you will allow him to release a dozen before you start to dip them in the butter , season them with the pepper vinegar , and put them away , mopping up the " gravy " of oyster juice , butter , and marsh mud with the already greasy johnnycake , corn fritter , or hushpuppy . Somehow , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomparable to anything , unless you know exactly what a Carolina marsh smells like with the wind in your nose and the water oaks shivering before the wind . You then lick your fingers and look reprovingly at the little boy if he has not managed to liberate another dozen oysters during your complete concentration on the first twelve . The Old Man used to say , " There ai n't no such thing as enough oysters  --  it 's just that the human stomach was never really designed to handle a decent bait of them . " My best  | record was four dozen , each oyster as big as a candy bar . It was possible , of course , for a man to open his own oysters , but you lost something of glamour in the process , for the small boy was as much a part of a roast as the odor of steaming seaweed , the smell of the sea and trees , and the scent of the roasting oysters as they reluctantly relaxed their valves under the steady pressure of the flame . You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owl and the hollow boom of the surf and the damp smell of the white beach sand , or the rustle of the sea oats that grew down on the dunes nearly to the water 's edge . There was another thing  --  two things , as a matter of fact . One was that a man opening his own oysters never had enough will power to unleash a dozen before diving into the butter . The other thing was that you robbed the little colored boys of a chance to bet their night 's wages on which client could eat the most oysters . A man who was having his oysters shucked for him was duty-bound to founder himself , or it would cost his little assistant a mess of money , as much as fifty cents . The boys kept the shells as a tally . They rarely lost money backing my appetite . There was a certain artistic elegance to this scene of gourmandizing  --  the firelight red on the already-flushed faces of the cooks , glistening off the white eyeballs and black faces of the little Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eaters , lighting up the rough shed with weird shadows , and making weirder shadows of the angular , wind-tortured trees . The road to the roast was always of gleaming crushed oyster shell , which seemed fitting , and there was a bone-white , high-piled stack of shells off to the side . This was the coeducational outdoor aspect of the holiday time . The more intimate and cruder cookery by the gentlemen came on the two- or three-day hunting trips . Some of the richer men , off after ducks or deer , took along a cook . At that time there was a profession amongst the Carolina colored folks that  | possibly no longer exists , more 's the pity  --  that of " sporting cook . " He would be a man of the approximate moral equal of his employers , which is to say he would n't work steady if there was an excuse in the world to run loose in the woods and listen to that fine man-talk . Generally he drank  --  intemperately , sporadically  --  and so was adjudged a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fellows , and the best of them all was a paroled murderer who worked occasionally for my family . The name has gone away , but he was wizard in the woods . He did some things with a few rocks and an iron grill , shoved some oak chips underneath , with hard hickory to flavor it , and the venison chops that came off the grill would make you cry . Venison is a hard meat to cook , and a lot of people spend a lot of time basting it with this and that , and undrying it with jellies and wines , but this fellow would just toss it onto the coals , haul it off , and slap it steaming on the plate , and you always burned your tongue because you could n't wait . I used to go to bed , full as a tick , already thinking about breakfast next morning . Breakfast would be something special in fried eggs  --  he always toted an iron skillet , because he said you could n't fry anything so a dog would eat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some broiled deer liver , and slabs of fried buttered bread , and maybe , if everybody was hungry , a squirrel fricassee . He made hoecakes , which are nothing but hushpuppies  --  meal and water and salt cooked in ashes . You scrape off the ashes , and there is a noble one-bite piece of ecstasy , especially if you 've got some redeye ham gravy or fatbackflavored potlicker to dip it in . I have never liked any egg , in any form , in a restaurant , but a fried egg in the woods , sizzled in bacon fat until its white edges turn to fine Belgian lace , grading up to brown , is a noble thing . And if it is accompanied by fried sowbelly and busted into a plate of fine-ground hominy grits , and the whole mess flavored up with grease , there may be indigestion around the corner , but it is not worthy of worry .  | A lot of people wo n't eat a possum because it looks like a rat , but our cook could take a possum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few carrots , and I 've never eaten anything in Paris , France , that could touch it . It was n't fat and it was n't lean . It was a kind of blend of both . Remembering back to eating in the woods , it seems to me that the main staple , apart from coffee and sugar and salt and stuff , was corn sirup or molasses . A can of beans slow-cooked with molasses and onions and strips of bacon quit being just pork and beans . We used the long sweetening for everything ? to sweeten coffee , drown the hotcakes , help the beans . We even combined it with ketchup on the spaghetti . There are worse things than a duck or a fish caked in clay and set to slow-cook until the clay cracks , and when you peel it off the feathers or scales come with it . There are worse things than a chunk of fresh-killed deer liver broiled on a green stick around a campfire . Nobody has yet found a way to commercialize creek water , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no comparable liquid for making coffee in a tin percolator in a nest of coals . Of course you realize all this was a very long time ago , and memory tends to make a man salivate . Youth and a body unjaded by whisky and tobacco are part of it , and of course the excitement of being out of doors . The only thing I ca n't figure out is that when I do it today it still tastes as good as I remember it , and very possibly a little better . The first real concept of conservation that crawled into my head was fed me gradually by the Old Man , without his ever saying anything much about it . It took a period of years to develop , but one day it came into bloom like an autumn rosebush . There are a lot of things mixed in with keeping your game supply up to standard ; some things that even a millionaire ca n't buy , such as friendship and cooperation . Like most boys , I was as bloodthirsty as a cannibal . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years old , and the robins and the blue jays and the catbirds and the rain crows really took a pounding . I shot everything from English sparrows to the neighbor 's cat . When we had nothing better to do , my Cousin Roy and I went out into the woods and played Indians and shot each other from ambush . Why somebody did n't lose an eye will always be a source of wonder to me . A big , old , sassy mocker lived in the magnolia tree alongside our house , and he used to sing late at night in the moonlight . He would scatter those notes around like one of the fishermen on Saturday-night payoff . He was a pet of my grandmother 's ; so it was natural that when I took down the Daisy one day and removed him from the concert business , the Old Man took down my pants and applied a very limber lath to my behind . It was one of the few times I ever had a hand laid on me , and it made an impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my noise had slacked off , " is the noblest sport yet devised by the hand of man . There were mighty hunters in the Bible , and all the caves where the cave men lived are full of carvings of assorted game the head of the house drug home . If you hunt to eat , or hunt for sport for something fine , something that will make you proud , and make you remember every single detail of the day you found him and shot him , that is good too . " But if there 's one thing I despise it 's a killer , some bloodcrazy idiot that just goes around bam-bamming at everything he sees . A man who takes pleasure in death just for death 's sake is rotten somewhere inside , and you 'll find him doing things later on in life that 'll prove it . I realize all young'uns get that first phase when they want to carve up desks and bust windows and shoot mockingbirds , but I aim to see you grow out of it , or I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want you to go to bed tonight and stay awake thinking about the mockingbird that sung so pretty and your grantitna loved , and then think of that little mess of dirty feathers cvcn  | the cat did n't want . And then think a little bit about this nice air rifle that Santa Claus brought you to learn to shoot with , and wish you had it back again . " Whereupon the Old Man took the little Daisy and busted it over his knee , and threw it over into the bushes where he had thrown the carcass of the mockingbird . That was Lesson One . I went quite a spell before I got my first shotgun , and when the Old Man took me out to learn to shoot quail he spent quite a time reading me the riot act about how many quail a man could shoot out of a covey and still have some quail left to shoot next year and the year after . Like most kids , my idea of what to do , once you got birds scattered pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That sank in pretty good , because those quail and the Old Man had been friends for a long time ; because he trained dogs over ' em , and knew to a bird what came out of the spring clutches . I did n't want him busting up my 20-gauge like he did the Daisy . And since he was my pretty constant companion in the woods , I could n't have cheated if I had wanted to . We hunted for quite a few years before it dawned on me that we had exclusive shooting rights to nearly a whole county . We shot land that said " Strictly Posted . " But we shot it with the owner 's permission , and we always started out with a word with the farmer , black or white , in his back yard , and always had a long , cold drink of icy well water out of the tin dipper . And when we came in tired and reached the house , we went in to warm chapped hands by the farmer 's fire . Then maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would have a little bit too , and a handful of cookies or a doughnut before we got in the Liz to drive home . This applied to both white and black . The colored folks were generally landowners , not croppers , and they had a big pride of land . I do not know how many little clapboard or log shacks I have been inside , with a roaring pine-knot fire actually showing through the house , the yard full of pickaninnics and yellow five dogs , with some old woman always doing something  | over an iron pot in the yard  --  scalding a hog , doing the clothes , but always doing . When we went inside to warm up , the house was always neat and clean , with the walls papered in colored pages from newspapers , calenders , or sometimes just newspapers . Outside , the white-sand yard was always swept clean . I had my first taste of squirrel-head stew in one of those little colored-folks ' houses , my first possum and sweet ' taters . I still love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tastes sweeter than any of those fancy French dishes . I called the older folks " Aunt " and " Uncle , " and the middle folks by their first names . They called the Old Man " Cap 'm , " and called me " Young Cap 'm " or " Mister Bobby . " There was n't any special servility , because the Old Man was always laughing and joking , and they always made a lot of fun of me , all loaded down with canteen and Scout ax and a gun as long as I was . Old Aunt Florence , grizzled and bent , would sometimes say , " Cap 'm , strange city man come out here the other day with some buhd dogs , and he drive up and ask me if I got any buhds on my place , and I say , Nawsuh . Ai n't seen a single buhd since dem big rains come last spring and drownded ' em all . Anyhow , dis place posted . We got too many hawgs loose in de woods . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yo ' buhds . I sont him off . " Aunt Florence 's little farm was so surrounded by coveys of quail , on purely public property , that she practically had to build a fence to keep them out of the yard . But the only way to the big timber leaseholds and swamps was through her yard , and she could look pretty fierce , surrounded by dogs that yapped ferociously at strange white folks . Or we would stop to pay a call on big Abner McCoy , who was six foot four and had all those young'uns . Abner would grin horribly over his gums and say , " Cap 'm , stay ' way from that covey over by de Old Church . There a den o ' foxes over there been eating up yo ' buhds and my chickens , and J  | got traps set thicker'n pine needles . Would n't like none o ' yo ' dogs to get caught . " But the other day I was cuttin ' some kindlin ' over by dat of graveyard , between de graveyard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covey of buhds I ever seen . Dese is new buhds . Must been usin ' cross de road , where dat loggin ' goin ' on , and plain could n't stand de commotion . So dey come live with us . Wait a minute , I finish dis chore , I come show you exactly . " We never wasted any time finding birds , whether we were hunting on Sheriff Knox 's big farm or Aunt Mary Millette 's , who did the washing . Either the birds were here or they were there . If they were n't here , they had to be there . And you found ' em from one year to the next . We had peafield birds and swamp birds and woods birds that roved a little to eat the pine mast , but usually centered around a certain scrub-oak grove or a sawdust pile or a copse of gallberry and dead branches . What is more , we had the whole county  --  a big county  --  to hunt in , and only one large estate was off limits . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day it suddenly struck me that no millionaire could own that much prime shooting , and there must be a reason for it . Well , there were a lot of reasons for it . For one thing , country folks in those days had no interest in quail unless they caught a covey running down a corn row and could kill the whole kaboodle for a stew . Or maybe to trap a few when times were tough and bellies growling . So they never paid anv attention to partridges  --  which is what we used to call the bobwhite  --  and never made any effort to help them survive or to keep people from just killing off whole coveys right and left . There were pot hunters in those days , dead-eyed gents with pump sawed-offs , who could wipe out a covey in a day if the birds scattered right in the broom sedge . The Old Man was pretty devious , as always . Everybody in the county knew him . I lc was in a position to give credit at t  | feed-and-grain store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of people planted on credit , and fed their cows on credit , and got their laying mash on credit . The Old Man could be counted on for one dollar 's or two dollars ' worth of personal loans , and at Christmastime he always went around with the flivver full of oranges and red candy . He had what are known today as connections at the source . Well , when he started to circulate the idea among his friends that he thought right high of those little speckled partridges that ran together in droves and called to each other so mournful at dusk , he got action . He would tell one farmer that it would be a nice idea if he planted just a few black-eye peas down by the swamp , or another if he would let some stock stand here or there after the harvest , or not plow that field of broom over to the west if he did n't really need the space that year . He said he 'd give two shotgun shells for every tame cat gone wild that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hawks and foxes and similar varmints . He said he 'd kind of appreciate it if the folks would keep account about where they flushed the coveys oftenest , so he 'd know where to go look for ' em . In return he was a sort of game scout , rounding up lost hogs and strayed cattle , and he was a terror about fire in the piney woods . Any time he came across a coon or a possum he would shoot it out of the tree and fetch it along to the nearest family . 1 le usually had a few tins of snuff or a plug of Apple tobacco in his hunting coat for the old folks . Well , sir , the upshot was that we had the primest shooting land around , and we had it pretty much to ourselves , and we had friends all over the place who looked after our game and kept down the brush fires and planted a little extra for the birds to eat . We had fires to warm us and cold water to drink and whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry . A long time later I read about conservation , but it seems to me the Old Man had it taped a long time ago . The only thing was , he did n't believe in sharing the wealth with every Toni ,  | Dick , and Harry . Only his friends and me , because he could control us . The Old Man reckoned that those birds were his birds , and not for nonappreciative short-time murderers to shoot into extinction . The more I look around at the opportunities for good shooting today , the more I think he might have been right on all counts .  | 14 Everybody Took Sick but Me I suppose everybody has one little particular chunk of time he wishes he could get back and live all over again . The one fine time I remember best and most lovingly was when whooping cough hit the schools  --  all the schools . It was what they called an epidemic . The epidemic struck about two weeks before the Christmas holidays started . First there was whooping cough , and then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of us lucky ones . The teachers had them too  --  including the principal . There was n't a thing to do but shut up hop and let the diseases run their course . By the time the race was run , it would be so close to Christmas that there was n't any  | use in starting classes all over again , just for a few days . So they knocked off school for nearly a month . I tried real hard to regret this unforeseen gap in my keen pursuit of such things as Latin and geometry , but it so happened I had enjoyed whooping cough and two kinds of measles , and I was salted . Maybe the other people were sick , but not me . I felt just fine . The chances are I was grinning all over my face when I got home the day they announced the closing of the schools . The Old Man looked sharply up at me and asked , " What happened to start you grinning like a Chessy cat ? Teacher break her leg ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They just closed down the schools until after New Year 's . We got an epidemic or something . School 's suspended . Hot diggety ! " " Look at you , " the Old Man chided . " Happy as a dead pig in the sunshine . Here you are , going to grow up ignorant , and all you can do is grin . I 'm ashamed of you . " " It 's not my fault I already had whooping cough and the measles , " I protested . " I did n't close the school . But as long as it 's closed , I do n't figure to cry myself to death . I think I 'll just go and shoot some squirrels . You want to come ? " " Not me , " the Old Man said . " This lumbago 's got nee . You 're going to have to handle this misbegot holiday all by yourself . Just try to check in with me once in a while , so 's I wo n't feel too left out of things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved his specs a little higher up on his nose and took to reading some book that must have weighed ten pounds . I changed my school clothes and went off to look for some squirrels . I did n't take the bird dogs along . I took old Mickey , the spaniel . People today talk a lot about these German Weimarancrs that 'll hunt anything from rats to elephants , but I 'll stack that Mickey up against any of them as a plain meat dog . She was a spayed golden cocker bitch , durn near as old as me and a whole lot fatter . She was a pure-T hunting fool .  | Mickey was slow but she was certain . She would find a covey of quail as good as any professional quail dog . Although she would n't hold a point , she 'd slow down enough to give you time to get up with her before she let out a yip and jumped . She would run a possum at night or tree a coon . She was poison on rabbits , because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outthink ' em and run ' em past you . She loved to hunt squirrels , and she 'd retrieve anything from a buck deer to a ground mole . She especially loved to go duck hunting , because the colder the water , the better she felt . One time I saw a big old bull mallard just about drown her . I do n't want to tell you any real big lies about Mick . She did n't run rabbits as good as a pedigreed beagle . She was n't as ( lead on wounded ducks as a Chesapeake or a golden retriever . She did n't cover as much ground on quail as even a slow pointer , and she was n't half the squirrel treer that little Jackie , the fice dog , was . But for most purposes she was the most all-purpose dog you ever saw . As long as the Old Man was laid up I could n't get too far away from base , because I was n't old enough then to drive the Liz . And there were n't many quail around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time to hunt much with the bird dogs . But there were a whole lot of little bits of game  --  a few quail , a few ducks , rabbits , squirrel , snipe . So for one solid month it was me and Mickey . The cold had come , and there was a thin crust of ice on the ponds in the morning , not heavy enough to bear your weight , but enough to force the ducks into pools of free water . The leaves were off the trees , so that you could see the squirrels , and a lot of the underbrush had died , so that the rabbits were fairly easy . You could always find one in a brush pile . There were a few doves still in the fields . Shotgun shells cost a nickel apiece . I reckon that this was the time when I picked up a very bad habit that has caused me a slew of complaints ever since . I was n't then , and never will be , what is called a dedicated hunter , just burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | more like a highly trained quail dog that has slipped his leash and is having a glorious time chasing rabbits . I liked to go out and just sort of mess around , with some No. 8 's in the shotgun and a few 4 'S in my hip pocket and two buckshot shells in my shirt pocket just in case a deer should run up and start out to trample me . One of the days I spent might have been typical of most of the days , and I will try to tell you how it was . I was out of the bed in the cold black night , with just a little glow in the old square stove in the living room . I dressed as close to it as I could get , and then went back into the kitchen and ate a cold sweet potato , a pickle , a glass of milk , and some leftover pound cake . I stuck a couple of apples and a bag of raisins in my hunting coat and did n't forget to grab a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun and the shells , I carried a small belt ax and a hunting knife and a light Army canteen . That was all I needed to be Dan'l Boone . Missis Mickey and I started out to conquer the country . We 'd go first , stumbling and half-frozen in the black morning , to a duck pond about half a mile away , and creep very quietly in the dark down to the water 's edge and hide in sonic brush I 'd stacked up to make a blind . When the first gray light came , there would be ducks on that pond  --  some butterballs and bluebills and a gray duck or a black mallard or so . I knew what I was going to do as soon as there was enough faint light to see by . I was going to pop off the first barrel at a clump of them on the water and then bang at a flyer as tltcy went away . Mostly I was good for about four more shots , because they 'd circle the woods and come back again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinch to bag about four , five , six ducks , especially if I got a couple on the water . This one morning I got only one on the water , and a wounded one fluttered up and I gave him the other barrel , just so I would n't have to go and hunt him in the woods . The ducks made the first return run , and I knocked down another and  | missed one going away . Then a fresh segment came in and I was lucky . I got one coming and one going . The first one I hit in the head . He went up about a hundred yards in the air like a skyrocket and came plummeting down as dead as a mackerel . Well , that was a fine start , I said to Mick as she plunged into the icy water . One black mallard , two butterballs , a bluebill , and a gray duck . We will now hang these ducks in a tree and go and investigate the squirrel situation . Mickey fetched the last duck and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said . Man , that water 's cold ! We were just a few rods from a big stand of hardwood trees , hickory mostly , with a few wild pecans that had sprung up a long time ago when somebody was farming there . You could almost always pull a few squirrels out of it , because there were acorns and pine mast as well . We walked very slow and quiet , and you could hear the squirrels chittering and making that click-clack noise on the nuts , and once in a while that long , metallic chirring sound . Mickey and I hunted very scientific . If the squirrels were on the ground , she 'd chase them up a tree and raise the roof barking . The squirrels would watch her , and I would edge around the other side of the tree and shoot . One morning I saw a big black-and-gray fox squirrel go into a nest , and I shot into the nest and four fox squirrels fell out . This morning we did n't have that kind of rich luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told Mickey to hush and we sat quiet under a tree and called the squirrels , slipping the safety of the gun back and forth to sound like teeth on nuts , and making that squirrrrr noise with my tongue . A couple of fool squirrels came skipping through the trees to investigate the noise , and I collected the pair . We picked up one more by accident as we walked through the timber stand , heading for a big deserted peafield that usually had some quail in it . Mickey lumbered off to where she figured the birds ought to be , and sure enough they were there . She shook her stubby tail and wiggled her rear end like she 'd slipped a ratchet some-  | where , and the birds got up wild ahead of her . I shot twice and downed one . I reloaded , and two lay birds got up , and I killed one and missed the other . The birds went into a wildgrape swamp that was so thick they were n't worth following ; so we quartered the field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . We were doubling back around to pick up the ducks and go home for lunch when Mickey cocked her ears and jumped a big buck rabbit , and I added him to the bag . When she fetched him , he looked bigger than she was . I pulled out my dollar watch , and it was only ten o'clock ; so I decided to stop and light a fire and clean the game . There would n't be any lunch for another two hours anyhow . I took the belt ax , and hacked off some pine knots and a couple of chunks of dead log , and built me a blaze . I shucked the squirrels and the rabbit and opened them up and started on the ducks . I had already eaten the apples and the raisins and I was still hungry ; so I took one of the quail and plucked him and stuck him on a green stick over the coals . He tasted a little burntfeathery and a touch raw , but he filled enough corners so that I could make it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a rather indelicate bitch . When I got home , I washed the ducks and the one quail and the dove and the three squirrels and the rabbit , and cut them up and put them in the icebox . Then I washed my hands and went to lunch , which was black-eyed peas cooked with sowbelly and hard country ham and bright golden cornbread and milk and apple pie with cinnamon dusted on it . Then I tool* a little nap , after asking big fat Lil , the cook , to wake me up at 2:00 P.M. , about the same time I 'd generally be thinking of getting out of school . I reckon I smiled when I slept , because all I had to do that afternoon was what I 'd done that mornin only in reverse order  --  rabbits first , then quail , doves , squirrc ducks . I performed this routine every day except Sunday for three weeks . Christmas Eve came , and the Old Man , better now of his  | lumbago , asked me what I thought I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't stop to think before I spoke . " Nothing that I can think of , " I said . " I 've had my Christmas . Except maybe I need some shotgun shells . I 'm about shot out . " The Old Man grinned . He 'd been watching me every day , stumbling home dead beat with a backload of game . " I sure am glad that epidemic of yours is about played out or there 'll be nothing else left in this neck of the woods to shoot . Remember what happened to the buffaloes . " Christmas morning dawned bright and clear , but I was n't there in the house to see it . I was down by the duck pond , with Mickey shivering beside me . I had clean forgot to look under the Christmas tree .  | 15 The Goat and 1 There was one spring when everything seemed nice ; it came early and stayed put , so that you got out the baseball stuff a month ahead of schedule and started to think about fishing and summer vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing and vacation , I started to plague everybody for a pony . I had read nearly all of Mr. Zane Grey 's cowboy stories , and I was horse-minded . The Old Man was pretty unimpressed with my **25;148;TOOLONG stage . He did not care for horses very much . " A horse , " he said , " is the dumbest animal I know , and he rakes a power of looking after . He 's got to be fed and watered and curried and combed . He 's always knocking a fetlock on the mall or something , and you need the vet to conic running  | every whipstitch . He has to be looked after like a baby , and I do n't know if you 've got enough concentration to look after an animal that big after the first interest in getting throwed off him has dwindled down . " Also , you know , " the Old Man said , " his stall has to be cleaned and his saddle polished and his blankets aired . Ile needs fresh straw , and he eats a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be walked to get himself cooled out after you 've run him hard . You got to watch his hoofs and take him to the blacksmith . You got a bicycle ; what do you need with a horse ? " I muttered something about every boy ought to have a horse , just like every boy ought to have a dog . The Old Man snorted . He said that pretty soon I would be telling him that every boy ought to have an automobile , and that some day I would be arguing that every boy ought to have an airplane . " Tell you what , " he said . " A horse is too large an investment for an unproven ability . We will just sort of try you out on a goat . Anybody that will look after a goat and cart will be a likely candidate for a pony , because nothing is quite as ornery as a billy goat . I know where there 's one for sale . I le 's a real handsome goat , if you like goats , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness . " We went to a place called Foxtown , where the colored people lived , and we stopped at the home of Albert Grey , the big colored boy who worked in the yard and told me fascinating stories to avoid doing any more work than he had to . Albert 's aunt owned a goat . The goat was for sale for five dollars . He was a real good-looking goat , young , fawn-colored , with a black stripe down his back , neat black hoofs , and a white star on his forehead . His horns were n't mature yet and had n't curved out , and he had a forehead that was rock-hard . I lc had the worst disposition of anything or anybody I ever met . We dragged  --  and I mean drug  --  Billy home , and he was protesting every inch of the way . He did n't want to leave Foxtown . He was happy in Foxtown , living under the house and eating anything that crossed his view . 1 Ie did not want to go and liv  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and penned him up in the cow lot . The first thing he did was charge the cow , to the intense surprise of the cow . It was a big old creamyyellow Jersey , with big horns , but that pint-sized he-goat had her scared stiff in five minutes . We left Billy glaring at us through the fence and went off to see about the cart . The Old Man brought the tools out , and we got a big packing box and converted it into the body . The Old Man found some wheels somewhere , and we mounted her on the wheels , stuck some shafts on her , and painted her red , and she was a very handsome cart . Then he got some leather thongs and some buckles from the hardware store and produced a fine harness . He even made me a small whip . " You 'll need it , " he said , kind of mean . " A goat takes a lot of explaining to . " The Old Man said that any boy fit to own a horse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because no cowpoke worth his salt would ride a horse somebody else had broken . The same , he said , applied to a goat . I would have to break Billy myself , so that Billy would respect me and be a oneman goat . In later years I began to suspect that there was a lot of evil humor in the Old Man . Bright and early the next day I set out to break Billy to his proper role of beast of burden . I went down to the cow lot and jumped over the fence , and Billy charged me like a lion . He hit me square in the stomach with that knobby skull , and I went over , all the breath knocked out of me . Billy backed off , sort of roared , and came again , like a cannon ball . This time I got out of his way , ran him down , got a strangle hold on his neck , grabbed an off leg like I 'd read the cow hands bulldozed a steer , and spilled him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated me with his cold yellow eyes . Well , sir , trying to put a halter and a harness on that durn goat was a sight to see . I know it was a sight to see because a few minutes later , when I was red-faced and sweating and as mad at the goat as the goat was mad at mc , I heard a chuckle .  | There was the Old Man , leaning on the fence and laughing so hard that the tears were streaming down his face and running into his mustache . " I do n't think you 're going at this exactly right , " he said , " but I 'm danged if I can tell you what you 're doing wrong , unless it 's that you ai n't got but two hands and need six . Wait a minute . I 'll help you hook him up . " Somehow between us we rassled the ornery beast into the harness and then tried to lead him to the cart . He sat down on his behind and braced his back legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped and he started to choke , but he did n't follow . He was n't a very big goat , and the Old Man finally picked him up in his arms and toted him to where the cart was . Then we tried to back him between the shafts . I heard somewhere about the camel and the needle 's eye , and the camel had a cinch to get through . Getting this goat backward into the shafts was like trying to thread a needle with a snake . He blatted and kicked and butted and wiggled , but we finally got him in and secured  --  we thought  --  with the little hames on his shoulders and the reins threaded . I got into the cart and cracked the tiny little whiplash and hollered , " Gee haw , " or some such . The goat looked around at me with the purest , most undistilled hatred I have ever seen in any eyes , and promptly lay down . We would drag him to his feet , and as soon as I got into the cart he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist and turn , and before long the harness looked like a backlash on a fishing line . Billy looked pleased . The Old Man shrugged . " I think that 's enough for one day , " he said . " We do n't want ' to rush his training . Let 's drag him back to the cow lot , and we 'll have another shot at him tomorrow . " We had another shot at him tomorrow , and it was the same old thing . This was a goat who would n't gee , would n't haw , would n't lead , would n't be dragged , would n't get up when he was lying down , and would n't lie down if he happened to want to stand up . He would n't go through the gate in the cow lot ,  | which had a low fence ; so I just simply took to throwing him over the fence . I had heard about Milo of Crotona in school , and I reckoned by the time Billy was a full-grown goat I could still heave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crotona was , but if Milo could heft a bull , full-grown , by starting out with him as a calf , I was n't going to be backed down by any damn billy goat . We worked on that goat for three months , and he never gave an inch . We had to battle to get him in the harness and battle to get him out of it . We had to run him down and catch him to get him out of the cow lot , and we had to throw him back like a fish when we were done with him . I was getting no mileage and no amusement out of this goat at all . Then one day I found out by accident that this goat was a true warrior . He loved to butt and to eat anything that was regarded as inedible , but he had another vice too . He loved to wrestle . He would rear up on his hind legs and charge , and when I grabbed him he would twist and turn and do his level best to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in except food . The wrestling wore a little thin after a while because if a boy wants to wrestle he might as well find another boy ; and anyhow , my mother was beginning to complain about my smell . This was a complete billy goat , including smell . I tried everything I knew in the way of kindness to gentle him , and all I got was that yellow goatish glare . It is n't any fun to live with something that hates you and wo n't work even a little bit for his board and keep ; so finally we took Billy in the I . iz and returned him to Foxtown . He let out a happy blat when he saw his old home , and promptly dived under the house when we turned him loose . I must have looked pretty downcast , because the Old Man stopped at Cox 's Store and bought me a soft drink and a nickel 's worth of candy . When we went on home he said , " Do n't feel too upset . There are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that ai n't worth troubling over . You can feed ' cm and  | gentle ' em and worry over ' em and coax ' em and try to teach ' em , but they 'll stay obstinate right on , like that damn goat . After a while , when you see it ai n't any use , the only thing is to give up . The thing is to know when to give up  --  not too early , not too late . " I did n't say anything . " You still want a horse ? " the Old Man asked very gently . " Not this year , " I said . " I 'm plumb wore out with that cussed goat . This year I 'm going to concentrate on fishing . At least I can manage a rowboat . " " Now there you are showing signs of sense , " the Old Man said . " No man can do everything well . A lot of men spread themselves out , trying this , having a dib and a dab at that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for something new when they 've failed . A smart man knows when he has a few things he can do well , and he 's wise to do ' em , especially when he 's failed at something . This gives him time to collect his wits and calm his disappointments , and then he 's fit to go off and try something new again . I think the bigmouths might be biting tonight , if you 'd care to try ' em . " The bigmouths were biting , and pretty soon my hurt feelings and frustrations cooled off and I was n't mad at the goat any more . But I will never forget that animal as long as I live . He put a scar on my self-confidence , and since then I have met a power of people like him . When I run up against a person or a situation that has all the earmarks of Billy , that is when I quit and go fishing . Up to now it has n't failed to help .  | 16 The Pipes of Pan The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy  --  the spring winds eased and the sun burned away the April rains , the green pushed softly up and all the smells began . Mornings before breakfast were delightfully cool and breezy , and bred a restless excitement that made you want to caper barefoot on the dew-wet grass . The smells were something . Down by the creek the dogtooth violets pushed up through the moss . The heavy tuberosy smell of the yellow jasmine filled the countryside , and the dogwood trees were white and pink with delicate bloom . In the orchards the early peaches and plums were breaking into blossom , adding their scents to the wild ones . The first tame flowers were popping out into the warmth , competing with the wild violets  | and the Johnny-jump-ups . I used to think that heaven would smell like this  --  cool and moist and very delicately fragrant . You took to the woods then , not as a hunter or a fisherman , but as a naturalist . The Old Man was very firm about that . " You 're a bloodthirsty savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodthirsty savages . But there 's a heap more to it than killing . Seeing the whole world come alive again after a long winter 's nap and a wild , wet spring is more fun , ' specially as you grow older , than all the shootin ' and fishin ' there is . And I never was able to explain it , but the critters seem to notice this too . You 'll see how tame everything is this time of the year , when it 's wilder'n a buck rabbit in the shootin ' season . " Maybe it seems a little dull today , but we used to go berry picking , after the blackberries had turned from green to red to purple-black , glistening on their thorny vines , and found it exciting . There were so many things to see and hear in the spring when you took a pail and went out berrying , to come home tired , with a crick in your back and your fingers and lips dyed purple from the juicy berries . There were birds around that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluebirds , which came early in the spring and went away later in the summer . There were lots and lots of the big , fierce-looking redheaded woodpeckers ; lots of what we called yellowhammers , another species of peckerwood known as flicker ; the big cuckoos we called rain crows ; the carnivorous shrikes with the bandit 's velvet masks across their cold robbers ' eyes ; and hordes of the big , brilliant , raucously screaming blue jays . The wet , plowed fields were crowded with teams of killdeers and the dainty-walking titlarks , racing along like pacing horses . The bobolinks were beginning to sway on the ends of high weeds , the stalks bending under their negligible weight . Soon the Baltimore orioles would be along , filling the air with sounds like the clinking of coins . The big cardinals were patches of blood against the dark green of the pines and cedars , and the scarlet tanagers darted like air-borne snakes .  | When I think of it now , I think of it in terms of sounds and smells rather than sights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the big , fat , sassy old mocker that lived in the magnolia mimicked the catbirds . The doves cooed sadly from a great distance , and the quail called from the brushy cover at the edge of the cultivation . They came marching boldly into the strawberry patches , not in coveys but in pairs , walking through the back yard as if they owned it . The killdeers wheeled and dipped in clouds over the wet fields , the skies filled with the mournful kill-dee , kill-dee , and the meadowlarks sang in the fields , and out of the wet places came the wild , sweet song of the woodcock . The crows and the jays raised general hell with everything , including the spring , and you could hear the rain crows ' hollow tonk from some hidden position in a tall pine , and the solid knock of the woodpeckers , and the sweet chirrup of the little bluebirds . This was the time of the year when the boys rushed out of school to swim naked in the creek at recess , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the time of the bellyache from eating berries that had not completely ripened , from experimenting with stone-hard green peaches ; and this also was the time of the lavish use of castor oil and calomel . It was impossible to concentrate in school , for the drowsy hum of June was just over the hill . Hence this was the time that boys were kept after school for throwing spitballs and making paper airplanes and dipping pigtails into inkpots . Summer vacation was yearned for by the teachers even more eagerly than it was craved by the students . Marks dropped terribly , and discipline teetered on the ragged edge of anarchy . The Old Man said he reckoned the whole world went a little crazy at this time of the year , and he told me if I listened real close I could hear the piping of some old pagan god n.nncd Pan , who was half billy goat , away off in the wood . I t old t he Old Man that if Pan was anything like my billy goat I would just as lief have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it may , " the Old Man said , " that wood back there is creeping with all sorts of forest gods and spirits right now , and if we went and set quiet I ai n't so sure but what we might see some . Hear ' em , anyhow . " The forest he mentioned was located back of the cow lot , and it was bounded by a big field of sedge where my pet covey of quail lived , and by a gully in which my secret interlocking caves were built , and by a big pond in which the diedappers swam and dived , and by a big soybean field that was full of doves in the fall . The forest covered about six acres , and was composed of towering pines and twisty live oaks and dogwood trees . Its floor was clean and mostly free of brush , a slippery floor of pine needles and jaunty wild flowers . The Old Man and I spent a lot of time back there . We had to remodel some of the caves , which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh beams under the heavy sod roofs ; so some woodcutting was in order . It takes a lot of work to keep a cave in good shape , especially when there are half a dozen connected by long tunnels . The reason we needed so many caves was that I was then chieftain of a robber band , and in watermelon season the robbers needed plenty of sudden sanctuary . Sometimes , when we got tired of working on the caves , the Old Man and I would sit down under a tree and lean back against the bole . He would light his pipe and tell me all sorts of wild tales about the Druids , who lived in trees , and the first Britons , who dug enormous caves called dene holes in the Kentish countryside in England , and about the bad spirits that lived in the Black Forest in Germany , and about the old pagan gods like Pan , who , I gathered , was a pretty fast fellow with the girls . The Old Man had been near about everywhere , and I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember today I remember from what he told me . I always got pretty high grades in geography , because if they asked what country Kent was a county of , like New Hanover or Brunswick County in my state , I could always say " England , " on account of the  | dene holes . I understood what a dene hole was because the Old Man and I had just dug us one . We saw a lot of interesting things , just sitting quiet or walking carefully . One time I saw a rain crow , one of those big cuckoos , chase a dove off a nest and settle down in it herself . I went back the next day and shinnied up the tree , and sure enough , there was one great big egg laid in the clutch of smaller dove 's eggs . We saw the squirrels fighting and chasing each other through the trees , and once I saw two squirrels breeding . The rabbits hopped around softly and unafraid of us . Once a deer and a fawn walked right up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old lady sort of nodded to junior and they went off , not running , not jumping , just sort of frisking , with junior kicking up his heels . I never did get to see Pan or any of the other strange people that live in the woods , but I swear I heard noises that I could n't hook up to bird or frog or animal or insect , and soft rustlings that proved to be nothing at all when I went to look , my skin goose-pimpled and my neck hair lifting like a worried dog 's when he hears a sound he ca n't quite figger . What I did get was the feeling that there were spirits who lived in trees , and that there was something very special about an ancient wood , and that there was some peculiar magic about the late spring that has been justified by the behavior of beasts and people down through the ages . ( This I learned later from books . ) There had been some talk among the grown-ups at the time about sending me off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was hot for it until the spring got soft and sweet and started to beckon toward the summer , and the Old Man and I made our daily pilgrimages past the cow lot and into the secret woods . But in May I would begin to weaken on this camp thing , and by June the camps had lost a customer . I knew when I had it good , because the Old Man always used to say that a smart feller knew when he was well off and was a goldarned fool to change it for something he did n't know about .  | Then , too , you understand , I was too busy to go to camp . The Old Man and I had a lot of projects together , apart from the baseball and the swimming with the other boys . We had to get the boat in shape for the summer 's fishing , and there was a puppy litter about due . We wanted to do some work on the duck blind , of course , and there was this billy goat to discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then there was fishing , of course , salt-water for blackfish and speckled trout and croakers , and fresh-water for bass , and by the time we got done fishing it would be September and the tides would swell , and then there would be the marsh hens jumping creakily out of the flooded marshes . When we finished with the marsh hens , the bluefish would be along ; and when we got through with the bluefish and the puppy drum , then the quail season would be on us , and before you knew it , Christmas holidays had come and gone . We were sitting quietly in the secret forest one day , waiting to hear some word from the Old Man 's friend , Pan , when he stabbed his pipe at me and said , " I suppose you 're going off to camp this summer and leave me alone and unprotected with all the grown-ups , eh ? " " I reckon not , " I said . " Why not ? They got all sorts of things up there in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and archery , and woodworking , and basket making , and lectures , and all sorts of things . You 'll get to live in a tent and paddle a canoe and " I been in a tent and I got a boat and I got the Atlantic Ocean and the Cape Fear River to swim in , " I told him . " I got you for a counselor . I ai n't interested in basket making or archery , because I got a shotgun and a boat that needs fixin ' . I just ai n't got time to play with children . The duck blind 's a mess . " " But here it is just spring , with a whole summmer ahead of you , " the Old Man was teasing me . " The way I figger , I 'm through Christmas already , " I said ,  | " and by that time it 'll be puppy-training time and we 're right back in the summer again . " " I expect you may be right , " the Old Man admitted . " Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I s'pose , is why one day you wake up suddenly and you ai n't a boy any longer . Anyhow , I 'm glad you ai n't going . It gets awful lonesome around here with all them grown-ups . "  | 17 Life Among the Giants " Did you ever wonder why I spend so much time and trouble and accumulated wisdom on you ? " The Old Man paused to look at his pipe as if it were a strange contraption he 'd never seen before . He convinced himself that it was a pipe , the same old scarred , crook-stemmed , thick-caked pipe which smelled like an incinerator and which he had owned about as long as he 'd owned Grandma . Or possibly as long as Grandma had owned him , which was more likely . Now , honest to John , what is a feller going to say to this tinestion ? No , sir ? Yes , sir ? I did n't say anything except a sort of mutter with a rise on the end of it , like a bigmouth coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  | " You 're gettin ' smarter already , " the Old Man told me . " I liked that Yumph ' you just did . You did n't give nothing away , and kept yourself covered at both ends . Like poker . You know , poker is like fishin ' , or mebbe more like waitin ' out a deer stand or a turkey blind . Did I ever tell you about poker ? " " Numph . " " Hmmmm , " the Old Man said . " I would judge you had kings backed , and maybe my queens ai n't good enough . You 're gettin ' real cagey in your old age , ai n't you ? " " Mmmmph . " I was noncommittal-like . I had stepped in those traps before . " Why , " the Old Man asked me , " would you suppose that a man of my advanced years and general accomplishments would waste so much time trying to beat a little knowledge and a few good manners into the head of an unlicked cub ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I du n no . Am I trying to leave a memorial behind me ? You tell me . " " I do n't know , sir . " I reckoned I had taken that " Yumph , umph , mmmm " business about as far as it would travel . " I like the answer , " the old gentleman declared . " Damn rare thing these days , in the age of experts , where a feller 'll set down and say he do n't know something . It 's a smart-aleck age , full of **27;175;TOOLONG , people that 'll just spar for time while they 're trying to figger out a way to conceal inbred ignorance . You ever notice I talk grammatic about one fourth of the time , and vulgar the other ? It 's because a man has to be able to talk correctly before he can allow himself the privilege of vulgar speech . You ever get curious about it ? " " Yes , sir , " I said . " I wonder , because they 're always at you in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g 's , and not use double negatives . I find it kind of hard to follow you sometimes . " " You like crackling ? " the Old Man asked . I could tell this was going to be a hard day . Crackling is the seared skin of a young pig . It is as crisp and tasty as the things they give you at cocktail parties today , and has more nourishment . But it had no point in the conversation .  | " Yes , sir . I sure do . I like chitterlings , too , and scuppernong wine , and ham hock , and collards . And candy . " I was getting a little mad . If the old gentleman was going to throw these things at me , I figured I 'd heave a couple back . " Only reason I asked about crackling , " the Old Man said , " was that I was rereading that thing of Charles Lamb 's  --  what d' you call it , Dissertation on a Roast Pig , or some such , I forget ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They make you read that in school yet ? " " Yes , sir . " I was very heavy with those " sirs . " Once in a while the Old Man went big literary on me , and " sir " was the only way out . We got mixed up with some old Englishman named Chaucer once , and Chaucer and I went round and round for what seemed like years , until I " sirred " my way out of it . " Well , all I got to say is , any man who can make you hungry after he 's been dead a hundred years is a hell of a writer , " the Old Man declared . " Where was I ? Oh , yes . What you gon na be when you grow up ? " " Confused , " I started to say , and bit it off . The Old Man liked to handle the flippancy business himself . " I do n't know , sir . Maybe an artist . Maybe a writer or a sailor . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's handy , not to know what you want to be until the time comes to be it . " The Old Man liked that one . " Until the time comes to be it , " he repeated , and kind of licked his whiskers like a happy cat . " I 'm pretty well pleased with you today . " " Yes , sir . " " You can overdo them sirs , ' boy , " he said . " You ai n't fooling nobody with that mock humility . So I will tell you why I spend all this time and conversation in my failing years , when I could just as easy be setting and rocking instead of talking . The reason is that all I got of me to pass on is you , and I know a couple or three things I like . I know quite a lot of goods and quite a lot of bads , and as long as I ai n't got any money I would like to leave a few of the good things behind . You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Well , now , " he continued , " a gentleman starts down at his boots and works up to his hat . A gentleman is , first of all , polite . A gentleman never talks down to nobody , or even to anybody that says anybody ' instead of nobody . ' A gentleman ai n't greedy . A gentleman do n't holler at anybody else 's dogs . A gentleman pays his score as he goes . He do n't take what he ca n't put back , and if he borrows he borrows from banks . He never troubles his friends with his troubles . " It looked as though we had disposed of what a gentleman was apt to be made of . I did n't say anything . " What is a sportsman ? " The Old Man was n't even asking me this . He nodded his head , as if he was giving himself a vote of confidence . " A sportsman , " he said to nobody , " is a gentleman first . But a sportsman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it 's a fish or a bird or an animal , or what he wants for a special reason , but he never kills anything just to kill it . And he tries to preserve the very same thing that he kills a little bit of from time to time . The books call this conservation . It 's the same reason we do n't shoot that tame covey of quail down to less'n ten birds . " This I could understand . We trained the puppies on those birds , and the birds always stayed put . " I never knew a bad man who was what I 'd call a sportsman , " he said . " I never knew a true sportsman who was n't a gentleman . So if you are a gentleman and a sportsman , you ca n't be a bad man . Is that clear ? " It was n't , but I said it was . It seemed to save an argument . " I ai n't going to live forever , " the Old Man went on . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scars on your carcass that maybe you could remember me by , like the old beaver trappers blazed trees to mark their passage . This is why I 'm such a windy old bore . But up to now you ai n't shot anybody or busted into a store , and you have n't even been expelled from school . If they keep exposing you to education , you might even realize some day that man becomes immortal only in what he writes on paper , or hacks into rock , or slabbers onto a canvas , or pulls out of  | a piano . You know , " he said , " I really am getting old . I ask your tolerance and forgiveness for the lecture . I reckon I 've started talking to myself . What would you like to do ? " " You would n't think I 'm silly , would you , if I showed you something you do n't know about that I been doing lately ? " " I would n't think that anything you ever showed me was silly if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Man said . " Lead on , Macduff , and damned be he . . . " Well , I have to write this kind of quiet , because I embarrass easy . The Old Man and I walked over to a great big wild cherry tree , about a thousand yards from the house , and I showed him the steps nailed neat onto the tree , plenty wide enough for handholds and footholds at the same time . The steps went up about thirty feet or so . Then in a big crotch of this tree was a house . I had been reading The Swiss Family Robinson , and I had been fascinated with the tree house they built , that they called " Falconhurst , " and I had built me one , as I said . There was a curious four-way spread of branches in this cherry tree , and it was pretty easy to make a house in the spread . It was a good house , although hoisting up the planks with a primitive block and tackle had been difficult . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anybody to be prying at . I 'd found some clay down by the creek , good potter 's earth , and I had made a very sad stab at being a sculptor . There was a bust of the Old Man I thought was right fair , but it had a tendency to crumble , and I did n't know the first thing about glazing clay . Then there were some awful drawings I had made with crayons of what I thought birds and dogs and deer ought to look like , and I had stuck them around the rough board walls of my Falconhurst . I had some pelts for carpets on the floor , some stiff-dried hides of rabbits and squirrels . In this tree house I had a bed of pine tops lashed with rawhide over bendy branches . I even had a stove , which I had contrived out of some old junk iron from the local dun p , and which nobody could have cooked anything worth eating on .  | In this house there were spears which I had made and pointed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arrows . There was a bookshelf , filled mostly with things like Robin Hood and Ernest Thompson Seton 's Rolf in the Woods and Two Little Savages and quite a lot of Tarzan and Buffalo Bill and Treasure Island , and even Sir Walter Scott . There were some arrowheads I 'd found and the usual junk a kid will hive up when nobody 's looking  --  sea shells and secret stuff he wants to keep away from grown-ups who 'll be apt to discount it as childish . I was taking a chance on the Old Man when I showed him my stuff . Really , I should n't have worried . He climbed creakily all the way up the tree , sat down in a little makeshift chair I had built onto the planking of Falconhurst , and panted a little while he fumbled some tobacco into his pipe . Then he looked around at everything and asked me , one question at a time , about how I got the things , and why I got the things , and especially if I had ever read anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay fright-mask I had made of him . He took the books down off the shelf , reverently I thought , and he rubbed his hands over the badly tanned skins , and he tested the bounce of the bed . He looked at the stove , and hefted the bow and arrows and the spears , and clucked appreciatively when he noticed that the bowstring was rawhide and not cord . Then he looked at me as though expecting me to ask him something . " I suppose it 's kind of silly , " I hesitated , and he answered with something I 'm never apt to forget . " I wish I had me a house like this , " the Old Man said . " It 's got everything in it that a sportsman and a gentleman needs to be happy in . And now I have answered that first question I was asking you , about why I spent the time and trouble on you . " A lot of people said a lot of nice things to me since , but nobody ever beat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree .  | There is a time in the life of every Lilliputian when the gigantic grown-ups around him are very important . This is the time when the boy is not so very far away from being a grown-up himself , and the grown-ups are not so far away from being boys . What I mean to say , a certain politeness is indicated . There is a time when it is very bad to patronize a boy , just because he is n't quite a man yet . The Old Man was a couple of hundred years older than I , the way I figured it ; so we did n't have any conflict there . I mean , he was old and seasoned before I was born ; so I was willing to take him like you accept the old dog that 's too tired and too creaky to hunt any more , and just wants to lie in front of the fire . The Old Man was past proving anything . He had it wrapped up . I 've been lucky all the time I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what small boys needed in the way of companionship . Looking all the way back as far as I can look , I ca n't remember anybody who ever made me feel as small as I was . This was a mighty little town in the South , a poor little town , which had one movie  --  it 's still called the Amuzu  --  and one restaurant run by a Greek named Pete , and two drugstores , and two grocery stores , and one undertaker who was also the coroner and who had an interest in one of the grocery stores . It had a couple of boarding houses and something that could have been called a hotel if you stretched a point . I want to stretch a point for a minute and tell you a little bit . about the town . My cousin Kate Stewart ran a boarding house , and she had a colored man who worked as waiter and whose name was Allen Jinny . He was named Allen Jinny because his mother 's name was Jinny , and there were n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . Allen Jinny had a deplorable habit . He drank . When he got drunk , he was liable as not to spill some hot soup down the neck of a customer who was spending a whole hard fifty cents on Miss Kate 's cuisine , which was excellent if it was eaten inste*d  | of being worn . One night Allen Jinny was weaving through the dining room at Miss Kate 's place on the water front , and he tipped a scalding tureen of soup down a gentleman 's best boiled shirt front , and the gentleman raised a considerable ruckus . Miss Kate decided she 'd better have a word with Allen Jinny . She took him more or less by the ear and led him aside to tell him the ancient parable about what happened to the man who killed the goose that laid the golden eggs . Miss Kate was a lengthy talker , and she sort of overpowered Allen Jinny with analogies and things . She considered herself as the classic goose , and Allen Jinny 's livelihood as the golden eggs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quit spilling soup on people the goose was going to quit laying those golden eggs . This appeared to interest Allen Jinny strangely . He went back to the kitchen . The cook was waiting , because you can always sense a turmoil outside a kitchen . " What Miss Kate done say you , boy ? " the cook asked . " I du n no presackly , " Allen Jinny said . " Something ' bout some silly son of a bitch want to eat a goose , but I do n't know who de hell gone pick it . " That 's the way the town was . If you mentioned a goose , somebody had to pick it , parable or no parable . And so my goose got picked pretty good by some grown-up men  --  who at that time could n't have been more than twentyish to my teenishness . I 've already told you about Tom and Pete , the boys who pogie-fished some and made bootleg licker and drank bootleg licker and poached a lot and always wore hip boots in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old as they were . But my special grown-up friends were my Cousin Tommy and my non-Cousin Doonie and my non-Cousin Reggie and Dick , my Cousin Margie 's boy friend , whom she married later . There was my Cousin Bonner , who run the shrimp boat , and my nonCousin Willie , who was a little bit deaf in the ears . We had quite a lot of Scandinavians around at that time , and some Portygees , but the Squareneck I remember best was my  | Uncle John Ericsen , who is still alive and looks better than I , which is n't hard , come to think of it . I remember there was a time when John and another Scandihoovian were mistily trying to get aboard a boat that was swinging away from the pier , and the other ' Hoovian said , " Yoomp , Yon , yoomp ! " And John said , " Yoomp ? How de hell can ay yoomp ven ay got no place to stood ? " John speaks elegant English now , of course , because this was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Uncle Walker Newton , and all the St. George boys , especially Bill , who played catch on the ball club , and Donald , who was brilliant , but of whom they used to say he drank a little . And then there was my Uncle Rob . Uncle Rob was married to my Aunt May , and Uncle Rob was what we called chronically peevish . That 's to say , nothing suited him , except maybe me ; and me and Rob , why , we always got along good . Uncle Rob looked like a Scotch terrier , which is n't surprising , seeing as how his last name was McKeithan , and he had no truck with frivol or fancy . He was a fact man . I will tell you what I mean . One time Aunt May trapped him into going to church . There he saw another one of my female relations who would win few prizes for prettiness . Rob took one look at her and muttered . " That 's the ugliest damn woman I ever saw in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shhhhh , Rob , " Aunt May said . " The poor thing ca n't help it if she 's ugly . " " No , but ding-dong and double-goddammit , " Rob said in his fretful falsetto , " she could stay home . " There was another time I remember when my best beloved uncle came in one Christmas Eve just a little , you 'll pardon the expression , fried to the eyes . He fell into the Christmas tree , toppled it over , busted the decorations , and set tire to the drapes . We used candles in those days . Uncle Rob pulled him-  | self up out of the mess , scraped some tinsel off one ear , and brushed some powdered glass from the smashed ornaments off his coat . He glared mistrustfully around him . " God damn Santa Claus , " he said , and staggered off to bed , summarily dismissing Christmas for all time . I hung around these men and they treated me like a man , and I never learned any nastiness from any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose ; he was a seafaring man and a bit rough , and so was Reggie Pinner , but he and Cousin Tommy and the rest took us young'uns to raise . Right . Doonie would fight , and Tommy would fight , when the mood come strong when the moon was right and the moonshine was wrong ; but when they had to do with me and my Cousin Roy and Harold and George Watson , they were the best governesses you 'll ever think to see . If we cussed , we got walloped , hard . The men did n't even cuss around us much , just an old damn or hell once in a while , and if us kids talked dirty , barn ! We went to the woods and on the waters whenever school allowed a breakout , and there was always a self-appointed chaperone to teach us caution and care with guns , neatness with camps , fire prevention , and love and respect for wildlife . They taught us such things as how to smother a grounder , moving up on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few knacks of aiming guns , and not shooting robins , and why a boat must be kept clean and the oars taken away and the boat dragged up on the shingle and overturned to keep the rain from rotting her innards . I wo n't name any names here , but some were drunks and some were loafers and some did n't shave or wash very often , but from a boy's-eye view they were the best men I ever knew . Some arc dead today and some have reformed , but I 've got more sweet memories of a tender taking-to-raise from those men than you could find in all the schools and churches and contrived ways t o give a kid a little dignity . Maybe we have lost this a little bit today . In the older times  | the town characters showed a little special wonderful tenderness to the kids . My ma and the Old Man never had a qualm when I was off in the woods with one of the roughnecks . They knew that roughneck would n't come home except to die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or Ted or Harold or Tom or George . And there were all sorts of things on the side . For instance , I learned about Kipling and Chaucer from one of the roughnecks who had , at one time before the bottle bruised him , graduated with honors in three years from a rather famous university . But he also told me about the barrio chino in Barcelona , and what it was like on the grosse Freiheit in Hamburg , and how to bust a bottle to use it fast if you needed a busted bottle in a brawl . He had been to two colleges  --  one literary , the other practical . I s'pose he was the one made me run away , eventually , to sea  --  but it was my Cousin Victor Price who saw that nobody bothered me when I was ordinary-seamaning around the tough ports of North Europe . He was an executive in the line I was working for . The Old Man , in his vast wisdom , never worried about what would happen to my moral character so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairy townsmen . The Old Man said once , " A boy has got to grow up to be a man some day . You can delay the process , but you ca n't protect the boy from manhood forever . The best and easiest way is to expose the boy to people who are already men , good and bad , drunk and sober , lazy and industrious . It is really , after all , up to the boy , when all is said and done , and there are a lot of boys who never get to be men , and a lot of men who never quit being boys . " I 'm not doing a very good job of this , I realize , but the tremendous love I had for all those people when I was a kid prevents me from doing a very good job of it . You 've got to realize what it means to a boy to be treated as a man grown by tncn already grown . You 've got to realize what it is like to be gently carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de-  | cency that they fear to bruise the stalk which is an adolescent , shooting up and subject to heavy impression , subject to hurt , as you might mishandle a gawky plant . I reckon that 65 per cent of the men who took me to raise could n't be admitted to a club , a church , or a tea party . I reckon that most were unread , most were profane , most broke laws , most did n't work , most drank too much , and most had dirty fingernails . And I reckon if we filled the schools with them as instructors today , and gave them jobs as cops , and set them up as tutors and baby sitters and camp counselors , we would n't have so much of a problem of delinquency . In my life as a grown man I have managed to stay out of jail , pay taxes , and live a life in which the values are pretty clearly drawn . This makes me lucky , maybe , but it is also a reflection on the positive contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bills and Reggies and Bonners and Robs and , of course , the Old Man  --  all of whom , in their own fashion , took me to raise . I got mixed up sentimentally serious with the Coast Guard at a very early age , because around where I come from the Coast Guard was an industry as well as a luxury and a necessity . We lived in a little town where the Cape Fear River emptied out into the ocean , and there were Coast Guard stations on a big island called Bald Head and also on a spit of land named Fort Caswell . There was a lighthouse on Bald Head , and there was a lightship a little farther offshore , because we had some shoals called Frying Pan that were powerful treacherous . There is something about real functional Coast Guarders that is maybe a little different from other people . They are a special breed ; you could maybe call them a race . They mostly all seem to come from down around Hatteras and Ocracoke  --  so much so that we used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Midyette , except the ones who were named Willis or Pickett or Barnett or Robinson . These men lived with windswept loneliness and they lived  | with cold wet death . They were veterans of battle with what somebody later called the cruel sea . They lived on gale-raked islands and rode patrol on the silent beaches on horses and mules always looking seaward for signals of distress . I remember well that the father of a friend of mine , named Bill Styron , was struck by lightning while riding beach patrol at Hatteras . The bolt killed him but did n't kill the mule , which tells you something about mules . When the wind came furious and whipped up a stranger 's offshore trouble , and a ship was fast aground or heading that way , when the lighthouse could n't prevent it and the lightship off Frying Pan had n't successfully done its job , friends of mine like Pete Midyette went into business . They had these double-bowed whaleboats , called surfboats , that nothing or nobody could capsize , and they shoved them through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold , wet , enormous-waved nights to see what they could do about who was in seafaring trouble . To me they were greater heroes than anybody I ever met later , because they did their jobs when others would have run away to a snug bed and a fire . Quite a lot of them got drowned in a cold Atlantic Ocean , for very little money and practically no amusement at all , because those islands were bleak . A boy named Dallas Pickett was a friend of mine when his old man was cap'n of the Bald Head station and an older friend of mine named Bill Willis was running Caswell . Bill was a pure down-homer , stringy and weatherbeaten and wrinkled , and in addition to his other duties he had to go out and knock off a rumrunner every now and then in the little cutter they gave him to chase rumrunners with . It did n't make no difference to me that they said Bill Tyce  --  that was his middle name , Tyce  --  never took on a booze boat until all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing was that he would sometimes take me with him when there was a rum boat to chase , and I learned a lot about fishing while we were chasing booze . It was the same way with my friend Dallas Pickett 's papa . I is  | would let Dallas bring me and my Cousin Roy over for week ends to Bald Head , and we would stay in the big , bare , sandyfloored , stripped-for-action Coast Guard station . We would climb the watchtowers and make the beach patrol at night with the men , and we would go out in the heaving surfboats on pracrice beach launchings . The Old Man encouraged these expeditions . He was a deepwater man himself , a sea captain and a licensed river pilot , and a fisherman too . In the off season he went to sea after menhaden , or pogies , the fat-backed fertilizer fish , in a creaky old boat called the Vanessa  --  and he liked me to know about water and what its chances of killing you were . Also he said he never knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot by hanging around people that used the sea as a livelihood , always remembering it as an enemy . In any case , I was over to Fort Caswell one time when Cap'n Willis , Bill Tyce , that is , broke out the rum chaser and said he heard there was a booze boat close at hand , and would I care to go help him chase the rumrunner . You understand the government boat was a rum chaser , and the quarry a rumrunner . This seemed to me to be an invitation worthy of acceptance , because I knew that on rum chasers there were machine guns and rifles , carefully cherished in scabbards of sheepskin with the clipped wool inside , well soaked in oil to prevent rust , and I knew the runners had the same armament , and once in a while when there was a disagreement between law and order and man 's naniral thirst , the guns came oily-wet out of the clipped-fleece scabbards and people started to shoot at each other . At my age , I hoped there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could aid in some capacity in the shooting . Well , we overhauled the runner off Frying Pan Shoals , and a sad little beat-up craft she was too . I have to report regretfully that there was n't no shootin ' . The Cap'n signaled her to heave to , and she plain hove to . She had a few cases of illegal booze from the Bahamas and a dirty , unshaven , scared crew of three , and so the Cap'n put a prize crew aboard her , and told the prize  | crew to take her in for the Customs to worry about and for the Federals to worry about . I think the prize crew was a man named Midyette , which is a safe bet , because the prize crew looked pretty thirsty . Well , sir , with the business of law and order taken care of , no shots fired , we looked around . There the old chaser was right smack on the lip of Frying Pan . There are shoals , I swear , where a man who knows how to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his left hand and then jump over the side and drown himself on the starboard side , without changing course a half degree . What I mean , Frying Pan is tricky , and you may remember that tricky shoals breed fish . Cap'n Bill announced that he had n't had a mess of real fresh mackerel in a whole hell of a long time , and did anybody have any trolling gear aboard ? The Coast Guard said yes , because in those days the Coast Guard was better prepared than the Boy Scouts ever thought of being . Cap'n Bill went for'ard and had a word with the Helm . The Helm knew his business . We started playing tag with Frying Pan Shoals . The Helm took the chaser so close to those shoals that you 'd swear we 'd smash aground if there was another knot in the breeze , but gentlemen , may I say , what fishing ! The gear consisted simply of hand lines and a couple of rods with reels older than Noah 's original equipment . For lures we had quills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a piece of sailcloth , or anything else that would create a ripple . You could of trailed a finger over the side and if there was a hook on the fingernail , you 'd have caught a fish . Now let me see if I can tell you what it was like . You had the white-gleaming shoals shimmering underneath a shining sun at about this time of the month , and you were a boy among men  --  a youth among warriors  --  and the sun and salt and breeze were fresh in your face . The water was the cleanest blue , clear , shading to green and finally to the white of shoal water , and in that roily water were fish . They were maybe not the biggest fish a fellow ever caught ,  | but there were more of them than I can believe possible today . There were vast schools of blues  --  fat , greasy , jut-jawed blues ? weighing up to maybe three pounds , and mean-frisky from the cold sea . There were gangs of Spanish mackerel , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a horse mackerel or so . And they were hungry , eager for the hook . I would n't say there was much sport in the actual catching of the fish , because all you did was throw out the line , let her trail a bit , and as soon as she was clear of the screw you had a customer on the other end . Then it was up to you to get the fish back into the vessel , whether you were hand-lining him or horsing him in on reels that would n't go either way , in or out , unless you fought ' em . And barked fingers . The real sport was the job the man at the wheel was doing . He was playing the boat like it was a big salmon in tough swift water , on a four-ounce rod with a no-strain line . He did n't want to kill the fish , and to not kill the fish he had to slack his engines , and he had to fight those shoals with a knowledge of wind and water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did any bullfighter play a bull like this boy played that ship against those shoals . I swear , I yanked too hard one time and the fish flopped out on the beach . And we were deep-water trolling ! We filled that Coast Guard boat full of fish  --  brown-gray-green spotted mackerel , lean shimmering-steel blues with all the fat under the smooth submarine shape , and blunt-nosed bonito  --  and in a couple of hours we were headed home . I can not remember the name of the man at the wheel , but he never touched a screw or a keel to those deadly shoals , and the ship frisked like a colt when he took her in to the last inch , and tossed her mane as she came away . It was a tremendous thing to be a boy among men ; and sitting in that rum chaser , sunburnt , sweaty , hot skin cooling from breeze , all full of righteous indignation that any bootleggers would even attempt to try to fool my Coast Guard , I was a young king amongst his faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept her off the  | shoals . It was my friend who was skipper , and who had kept the Atlantic seacoast free of the Demon Rum this day , while catching bluefish and mackerel besides . We were coming in triumphant after having saved America without firing a shot . The man at the wheel had headed the chaser home , and her prow knifed a clean line through the sparkling sun-kissed spraytossed waters . The things you see when you are going home triumphant are marvelous . I watched a gannet working on a red bank of menhaden . I saw the porpoise sounding and rising . The little ship bucked and pranced , full of rightful triumph . I was not even about to be seasick , because I was a man out with men , doing a man 's job . Of course it is easily possible to say that a boy had no place , legally , on a rum-chasing expedition , and that a government boat that was coursing a bootlegger had no business to stop and go fishing , and that maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another , before the righteous arm of the law could smash the bottles . But there was one thing more : There was a boy's-eye view of men at work , but men with time to play , and men to make a boy feel a man . There was a Charlie Snow to ask you down to his house around Matamuskeet to teach you how to fool a goose . There was a Bill Barnett , a burly , red-faced man who was exec before Bill Tyce went off the station , who never made you feel a boy so long as you were with men , and who never expected you to act like a boy so long as you were with men . These days I read about the delinquents and what causes delinquency , and I suppose you could say that a child as young as I was had no business combining rum chasing with fishing , that maybe I should n't have hung around the docks with people who cussed . I do n't know . Maybe my later character was imperfectly formed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of Frying Pan Shoals , after you 've just knocked off a rumrunner , is a type of sport you are n't going to get out of comic books and television . And until a man has put his shoulder be-  | hind the sharp stern on a surfboat , to shove her in the black night through the shore-crashing seas , off the cold clean beach of Bald Head , with the gulls crying and a dying ship offshore ? well . There are all sorts of ways to get to be a man , the Old Man used to say  --  and none of ' em easy . The Old Man was fairly grumpy through the summer months , because the beaches were crowded with summer people and the bluefish knew it and stayed offshore . All our pet sloughs were full of swimmers , splashing and making noises , and if you tried surf-casting the inlets at night you had to pick your way through the neckers . " Labor Day , " the Old Man said , " is the best holiday of the year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and leave the water to the professionals . A professional " ? the Old Man grinned ? " is the kind of damn fool who actually fishes when he goes fishin ' . He do n't turn it into a whisky party or an excuse to play poker , not that I 'm low-ratin ' either sport if taken in the correct perspective . " Some of the Old Man 's feeling rubbed off on me . I could hardly wait for that first Tuesday in September , because the beach would be scrubbed clean of people by noon , the summer visitors having taken their hang-overs back to town for another year . Then and only then did the hardshells emerge  --  the yearrounders who were plank owners in the boardwalks . They were a grimy , grizzled , hard-bitten lot , including the few women who were admitted into the high society of surf casters . Then we owned the beach . A beach suddenly flushed clean of strangers is a wonderfully lonesome place . All the boarding houses and summer cottages and hotels board up their windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dance hall shuts up tight . The trolley service goes on winter schedule , and only the Greek keeps his general store open part time  --  I say part time , because most of the time the Greek is whipping the sloughs for  | the bluefish and sea trout and channel bass that come in close to feed off the minnows and sand fleas . The weather knows it when the tourists leave . It invariably stayed fine for the long , noisy week end , but by Wednesday we generally had a gorgeous three-day norther started , and that norther was always the most exciting thing about the summer . An Atlantic beach in a norther is wild and exhilarating . The sky turns gray , and the wind drives the rain in angry gusts . The surf booms , and towering sheets of spume drive skyward as the waves smash onto the sands . Suddenly the tin stove earns its pay , and the driftwood in the fireplace burns blue and green . A sweat shirt and flannel pants feel wonderful , and there is a snugness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer squalls . For three days the wind screams and the water boils white , and then the best time of the year begins . The sun comes once again , warm and golden , and the skies are washed bright , but now the breeze is crisp and the air is full of wine . The water is not too cold to fish barefooted , but if you stumble and wet yourself all over , the goose-pimples form when the wind hits you . Give the waters a day to clear from the roily muddiness of the storm , and the fish swarm in to feed in the sloughs . The biggest fish have n't shown yet , and wo n't until late October , but the blues run to three pounds , and the puppy drum go up to fifteen , and there are always plenty of sea trout and Virginia mullet . All up and down the beach , toward the inlets , tiny , happy-lonely figures wade out and cast , walk backward and reel in as the rod curves and a bright sliver of fish flops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a part of our September song . Another part was in the Sound , where the north wind raises the tides above the iiiarsh grasses , and the mounting moon keeps the water high , until just the tips of the grasses show above the surface . That was when the Old Man 's mouth cracked in a big grin and he took the shotguns from their cases and sent me under the house for the push pole and the paddles.  | " Marsh-hen time , " the Old Man said , and we dragged the old flat-bottomed skiff off the shingle , where she had been upturned to keep her innards from rotting in the rain . We 'd kick her across the channel with the little one-lung motor , and when we hit the grass we 'd tilt the kicker and the Old Man would take the pole or  --  if the water was exceptionally high  --  paddle the skiff along like she was a canoe . I do n't suppose today that there is a great deal of sport in shooting the big rails we called marsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can miss . As the boat crept stealthily over the grasses , the big hens would spring creakily into flight , flopping low over the water and seeming slower than they actually were . The natural inclination was to shoot behind them , because of the water-skimming lowness of their flights . " Ai n't but one man at a time supposed to shoot out of a boat , " the Old Man said . " Otherwise you will be out with some blame fool some day and he will get excited and blow the back of your neck off . There 's plenty of marsh hens to go round , and you can only eat so many . " So the Old Man would push or paddle and I would sit on the bow thwart . The hens would rise from under the boat with a cackle , and more often than not you 'd have a chance to try for a stylish double . Then , after half a dozen birds were in the boat , I 'd move aft and take over the propulsion , and the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poling after the hens was hard work ; your boat was always getting stuck onto a mudbank , and there were still plenty of mosquitoes and other varmints clinging to the higher grasses . The sun smote down plenty hot , and your back ached like a tooth after hours of driving that skiff over what amounted to solid ground . But a boat full of the great , tawny rails , with their doe eyes and long legs and long , curved , mud-probing bills , made the blistered hands and sunburnt neck worth while . There is no more fascinating place than a marsh anyhow . A marsh literally crackles and pops with life . Off yonder in a  | wide stretch of water , a thin ripply wake tells you a mink is swimming . An old blue heron looks grumpily at you and waits until the last minute before he flops away in swaybacked , ungainly flight . Over there a bittern booms like a tomtom , and the white herons sit silent and secure , because they know you wo n't shoot them . Red-winged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the barest ends of the swaying grass , hurling their joyful song into the air . The sky above the marsh is always full of crows , cawing angrily as they scavenge . Along the edge of the mainland there was an enormous lightning-riven tree , where my private eagle always sat . The eagle , several times a year , was good for a fine show of aerobatics . There was a pair of fish hawks  --  ospreys  --  that haunted the area , and it used to delight me to watch them fish . You would see the male plummet down like dropped shot , smack the water with his outstretched talons , and struggle , wings flailing furiously , with a big bluefish nailed through the spine . As the hawk labored for altitude , Old Baldy would take off from his tree top and head for the stratosphere . When the hawk got enough height to level off and head for his nest with the flopping fish , the eagle , high above him , would fold his wings and come screaming down in a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions , and then drop the fish . Usually the eagle , still screaming down , would flash by the hawk and sink his grapples in the falling fish before it hit the water . Then he would come out of his dive and leisurely flap back to his lightning-ruined perch . Then the hawk would go fishing again , and this time he would be allowed to keep his catch . There were always ' gator holes to see , and occasionally you would see an old ' gator sunning himself on a greasy mudbank . The edges of the marsh were usually good for a coon or two , and the high hummocks close to shore were likely to yield you a brace of ( lark swamp rabbits . We ' most always took a couple of light rods and the cast net along , and when the water slacked  | off and began to drop so you could n't shove the skiff over the grass , we 'd take the net and seine a few shrimp and drop the hook by one of the potholes we knew by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of croakers , blackfish , big sand perch , and now and again a weakfish . Or , again , when we spotted a big school of fairish mullets , the Old Man swirled the cast net like a bullfighter 's cape , hauled hard on the draw cord , and dumped a half-bushel of leaping mullet on the deck of the skiff . The big ones we kept for the skillet ; the little ones made wonderful baits for surf casting . Around the edges of the sand bars there were always clams in the mud  --  big purplish clams that came shining from the ooze . They tasted wonderful in the raw , the hinges smashed with the back of a fish knife , and eaten there on the spot . We always kept oyster tongs in the boat , and added a bushel or so of the big , briny ones to the mixed bag in the bottom . We 'd roast these later , covering them with seaweed , and when you dipped them in melted butter there may have been better eating , but I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back leg , we chuffed under the bridge that spanned the channel and tied up in the swirling dark water next a barnacle-crusted piling . Here the huge , black , yellow-speckled stone crabs lived . here the sheepshead swam close to the old pilings , and if you knew your business you could hook them in their silly little mouths that spat out a shrimp unless you fixed the hook just right . By the time we got back home and pulled the old scow up on the shingle , it would take about three trips to the house to completely unload her . By the time the fish got cleaned and the marsh hens skinned and put in salt water to soak sonic of the fish out , it was dang near dark and time to get out the surf rods and fish the twilight into moonrise . It would be getting cold on the beach around dark , and I usually fixed us up a driftwood fire and set the oysters to roasting while we cast into the surf . By eight o'clock the Old Man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's when you ran a stringer through the fish , carried the steaming oysters up to the house , pulled off your wet pants , and shoved the coffeepot onto the stove . The broiled marsh hens followed the oysters , and once in a while we barbecued a fish or just settled for a cold crab salad . A long time after all this happened I heard Walter Huston sing " September Song , " and the old man seemed pretty high on one of my favorite months . But he was thinking about love , mostly , and love ai n't but about one-fifth of what September 's really like . My September song is still based mainly on the fact that all the tourists went home and left the beaches and the marshes to the Old Man , the eagle , and me.  | 18 November Was Always the Best A lot of people figure November to be a middling sad kind of month , with the trees showing naked against the leaden skies late in the afternoon , and the grass all crisp and brown from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red in the morning , and the evening cold making your nose run . The year has only one more month to live , and that is sad too , to some people . But November was the month I aimed my whole year at , for the very simple reason that the bird season opened round about Thanksgiving , and if you lived in my neck of the woods , " birds " did n't mean canaries or parrots or hlucjays . Birds meant quail . The Old Man was with me all the way on that one , but he liked to fuzz it up with a little philosophy . Like  | most pipe smokers , he needed some extras to hang on it to make it dignified . We were talking about the seasons one time , and the Old Man said that if he had to he could do without summer and all of spring except maybe May , and he would be just as happy to settle for October through January , and give the rest away . He said he would pick November as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was n't too cold , and you could do practically anything in it better than any other time of the year , except maybe get sunburnt or fall in love . " Although , " he said , " there ai n't nothing wrong with November , or any other month , for falling in love if the moon 's right . But mainly the reason I like November best is that it reminds me of me . " He stopped and struck another kitchen match to his pipe . " Look at me , " he went on . " Here you see a monument to use . I 'm too old to fall in love , but I ai n't old enough to die . I 'm too old to run , but I can outwalk you because I know how to pace myself . I know when to work and when to rest . I know what to eat and what sits heavy on my stomach . I know there ai n't any point in trying to drink all the licker in the world , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be rich , but I 'll never be stone-poor , neither , and there ai n't much I can buy with money that I ai n't already got . " A man do n't start to learn until he 's about forty ; and when he hits fifty , he 's learned all he 's going to learn . After that he can sort of lay back and enjoy what he 's learned , and maybe pass a little bit of it on . His appetites have thinned down , and he 's done most of his suffering , and yet he 's still got plenty of time to pleasure himself before he peters out entirely . That 's why I like November . November is a man past fifty who reckons he 'll live to be seventy or so , which is old enough for anybody ? which means he 'll make it through November and December , with a better-than-average chance of seeing New Year's. 1 ) o you see what I 'm driving at ? " I said , " Yessir , " because I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because I was worrying about a young pointer puppy who was going to have his first chance at being a working dog , and I was worrying over whether those late rains had n't drowned off the whole second clutch of quail , and I was worrying over my shooting eye , which had fallen off alarmingly the final two weeks of the last season . " What 's your idea of November ? " he asked , his eyes halfclosed . I wanted to tell him that it was mostly the opening of the bird season , and the Thanksgiving holidays , the persimmons wrinkled and ripe on the trees , when the weather was real nice , and it was hog-killing time in the country , and the punkins looked yellow and jolly in the fields , and the sun set good and red , and a lot of other things ; but I could n't manage to squeeze it all out because I had no way with words . " The bird season , " ' I said . The Old Man looked at me and sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make no philosopher out of you . Let 's us go look at the guns and figger out where we 'll best go tomorrow , when she opens . " The day and night before the opening of bird season lasts longer than anything , including the week before Christmas holidays . Awful , horrible thoughts keep you awake , such as will it be raining , or what if the dogs get hot noses or the quail have all moved ? And then the next morning dawns clear and bright with just the right breeze , and it is another ten years untiI afternoon . I used to beg and coax to start in the morning , but the Old Man was stone-set against it . " There ai n't no point to hunting in the , horning . Not quail , " he said . " They do n't feed out until nine or ten o'clock , and later if it 's cold , and maybe not at all if it 's too hot or raining . And if they come out at all , they do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you can get the dogs calmed down . You 'll find you 'll kill all of your quail in two hours  --  between three and five o'clock  --  with very few exceptions . All-day hunting just tires you and the dogs , and if you do  | get lucky and find birds in the morning you 've got your limit and there ai n't nothing to do in the afternoon . No , morning is the time for deer and ducks and turkeys , but the bobwhite 's a late-sleeping bird . " So we would mess around all morning , and then have us a light lunch about noon . By two o'clock we 'd be where we had headed , with the dogs shivering and nipping from excitement and slobbering at the mouth , and me wishing I could . We had a lot of places where we hunted , but we usually started her off at a place called Spring Hill , which we had a lucky feeling for , after trying for three or four coveys closer in , just to let the dogs wet down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . It is difficult , very hard , to try to explain what a boy feels when he sees the dogs sweeping the browned peafields , or skirting the edges of the gallberry bays , or crisscrossing the fields of yellow withered corn shocks , running like race horses with their heads high and their tails whipping . And then that moment , after nearly a year , of the first dog striking the first scent , and the excitement communicating to the other dogs , and all hands crowding in on the act  --  the trailers trailing , the winders sniffing high , but slow now , and the final eggshell-creeping , the tails going feverishly and the bellies low to the ground , presaging a point . Then the sudden freeze , then the slight uncertainty , then A minor change of course , and then the swift , dead-sure cod ; of head which says plainly the bird is here , boss , right under my nose , and now it 's all up to you . The backstanders edge closcr , especially the puppy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You walk past the backstanders and then up to the pointer , who is still stamped out of iron , like an animal on a lawn . And you walk past him and kick , but nothing happens . At this moment a blood-pressure estimate would bust the machine that takes it . Your heart is so loud it sounds lilac ? pile driver . There is something in your throat about the sir.c of a football , and your lips are dry from the temperature you 're  | running , which is maybe just under i io degrees Fahrenheit . You are looking straight ahead of the dog  --  never down at the ground  --  and you are carrying your shotgun slanted across your chest , the stock slightly cocked under your elbow . Nothing happens . The dog changes the position of his head and creeps forward another six yards , and you come up behind him when he freezes again . This time he 's looking right down at his forefeet , and when you walk past him he jumps and the world blows up . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of you , tiny brown bits with the thunder of Jove in each wing . They go in all directions  --  right , left , behind you , over your head , sometimes straight at you , sometimes straight up before they level . Then a miracle happens . Out of these billion bits you choose one bit and fire , and if the bit explodes in a cloud of feathers you choose another bit and fire again , and if this bit also explodes you break your gun swiftly and load , figuring maybe there 's a lay bird and you can turn to the Old Man with a grin , and when he says , " How many ? " you can answer , " Three . " More likely you 'll answer , " One " or " None . " But the tension is over now , and you find you have broken out into a heavy sweat . If there 's a crick nearby , you go and plunge your face in it , or at least you take a long drink from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hand is the first bird of the year  --  the neat , speckled , cockaded little brown fellow with a white chin strap if he 's a cock , a yellow necklace if she 's hen . He weighs less than half a pound , but has just induced nervous prostration in a man , a boy , and two dogs . This is when you first sniff the wonderful smell of gunpowder in an autumn wood , and notice that all save the evergreens have crumpled into red and golden and crinkly brown leaves , that the broom grass has gone sere and dusty yellow , and that the sparkleberries are ready to eat , the chinquapins ready to pick . The persimmon tree that always sits lonely at the edge of the cornfield is bare except for the wrinkled yellow halls that the  | possums love , soft and liver-brown-splotched now , and free of the alum that ties your tongue in knots and turns your mouth inside out . The dogs are roving out ahead , and the Old Man says , " Well , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the singles went ? " " I thought about six went over there by that patch of scrub oak , just at the end of the broom , " I say . " Le 's go have us a good look , " the Old Man suggests . " The dogs seem to think you may be right . Old Frank has either found a friend or turned into a stump . " At the edge of the broom , with the scattered scrub oaks making a screen before the swamp , is old Frank , nailed to something . And over there , like a lemon-spotted statue , is Sandy , nailed to something else . " You take this ' un , I 'll take that ' un , " the Old Man says . " We 'll walk up together . " Two birds get up under my dog 's nose , and I miss both clean , blim-blam ! I hear the Old Man shoot once , and then the rest of the group explodes in my face , and me with the gun broke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sneaker , gets up behind me , and I whirl and watch him drop off the end of my gun barrel . " That 's enough , " the Old Man says . " We got three apiece . Le 's go find another covey . There used to be one hell of a big one over the top of that rise that we never had no luck with last year . I was beginning to think they was bewitched when the season ended . Unless the cats and the foxes been at ' em , we could take the rest of the limit out of that ' un and not even make a dent in ' em . " The Old Man lights his pipe and I break an apple out of my pocket . I think I never really appreciated an apple until I ate it in the November woods , after the first covey of the first day of the year . We follow the dogs over the hill ; and when we top the brow , there is the white dog stiff , the black dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his haunches , wondering what to do next . This did n't happen every day , or even every year , but once in a while it happened like that , and I mean to say that the walk up to where the dogs were painted against the side of a hill was the longest , happiest journey I ever took in my life .  | 19 You Separate the Men from the Boys I do n't know why they did n't take February right out of the calendar , instead of monkeying around with it and making leap years out of it , because it is the worst-weathered of all the months , being halfway between winter and spring , with all the bad habits of both . I mean cold and rain and a little snow and a lot of wind and just natural nasty . The trouble with February is that January 's gone and March is coming next , and March is the most useless month of all , since there is nothing you can do in March except sniffle and wish the wind would quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too early to fish . There 's still a long way to go until school 's out , and " There ai n't any wonder , " the Old Man said , " that they told Caesar to beware the Ides of March . " I did n't  | ask the Old Man what an Ide was . I was afraid he 'd tell me . But we are n't talking about March . The subject is February , and there 's one thing you can do in February better than any other time of the year . That is shoot quail . For a long time I did n't believe it , but the Old Man always insisted that February was the best quail month of all . I remember one day it was drizzling that slow , cold , nasty , steady sizzle-sozzle that is so cold it burns like fire and turns your ears into ice blocks and makes your nose run steady . The sky was a dark putty , and you could see the icicles hanging on the window frames and on the roof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fire that was drawing so strong that she whistled as the flames sucked up the chimney , and occasionally he would cut loose and spit in the fire . It sounded like a blacksmith tempering a horseshoe . Hisssss ! The Old Man stuck out his foot and nudged a log that had almost burned through . It dropped in a shower of red coal to the bottom of the hearth and shot fresh slashes of flame up through the topmost chunks . The Old Man looked at me . " There is always one way to separate the men from the boys , " he said . " That is to watch and see if a feller 'll do a thing the hard way , when all the other fellers are sitting around grumbling and quarreling that it ca n't be done . " He cut loose another amber stream at the fire and looked at me with his head cocked sidewise , like a smart old dog . " Most people quit doing things as soon as the wire edge has worn off and it ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty part for a few individualists . Soon as the clerks run to cover , the big people got the field to themselves . " I did n't say anything . I knew the old buzzard pretty well by now . He was as tricky as a pet coon . All I had to do was nrjl:c one peep , and he 'd have me hooked . It 'd be something he wanted me to do that he did n't want to do himself . Such as going to the store in the rain for some new eating tobacco , or going out for more wood , or having to report on Shakespeare , or something . " You take quail , " the Old Man went on . " When the season  | opens around Thanksgiving , every damfool and his brother is out in the woods , blam-blamming around and trampling all over each other . The birds are wild , and the dogs are nervous , and they crowd the birds and run over coveys they ought to sneak up on . The ground is dry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no such thing as good single-bird shooting , because the bobwhites take off and land as a covey , instead of scattering . " Then along comes Christmas and New Year 's , and the parttime quail hunter is tired of bird shooting , and it 's too cold and too rainy , and he has to clean his guns ever ' time he comes in to keep the rust off ; so he ties up the dogs and forgets hunting until next year . This leaves the woods free of the city slickers and the ribbon clerks and the fashionable shooters . By this time the birds are steadied down and the dogs have had a lot of practice , and they 've steadied down too . The young birds have been shot over and have grown their heavy feathers , and the young dogs have figured out that if they find birds the man will shoot some and they will bring them to the man , and that everybody  --  the dogs , the man , and the birds  --  is in business together . It ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's men 's work . " I gave up . He had me nailed . " I 'll go get my gun , " I said . " You can drive me out and sit by the stove in Cox 's Store while I catch pneumonia . That is , if the dogs will go out in this weather . " " They 'll go out , " the Old Man told me . " The dogs are professionals . They ai n't part-time sports like some people I know . Go get ' em , and you better wear those oilskin pants and the oilskin jacket . The woods 'll be sopping . " Man , I reckon I 'm never going to forget that particular day . I sure was glad I was n't a fish , because those woods were wetter than a well , with the little droplets clinging onto the low bush , the gallberries , and the broom grass , and the trees dripping steady . There was n't a steady rain . It just sort of seeped down , half drizzle and half fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my fingers practically stuck to the steel . Rain collected on the gun sight and ran down the little streaiuway between the  | barrels . The dogs looked as miserable as any wet dog always looks , sort of like a land-borne otter . Rain is miserable anywhere , but I expect there 's nothing quite so cheerless as a wet wood in February . The sawdust piles have been soaked stiff and hard and dark brown . The green of the trees all turns black in the wet , so that you do n't get any color contrasts , and the plowed ground is a dirty , ugly gray . The few shocks of corn that still stand are spotted and shriveled , and the sad little heads of cotton hanging onto the dead stalks look like orphans lost in a big city . But the good Lord put feathers and fur on birds and animals to keep them dry and warm , and life goes right on . Except that the Old Man is right , as he nearly always is . Wet woods make birds a heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around very much , and you can spot exactly where they 're apt to be . And a dog 's nose works dandy in the wet , just as a car runs better on a rainy night , when you get richer combustion . I had n't been out of the Liz for five minutes when Sandy , the covey dog , disappeared into a little copse of pine saplings halfway between a peafield and a broom-grassed stretch that led to a big swamp . Old Frank , the single-bird expert , went to have a look and then came back to give me the word . He jerked his head in the direction of the pine trees , impatient as a traffic cop who wants a car to move on , and then he dived into the bush with his tail assembly shaking like a hula dancer . Maybe I have mentioned that I do n't shoot very well except when I 'm by myself or with the Old Man , because I 'm not selfconscious in front of him and do n't have to worry about shooting too fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself it seems as if it 's almost impossible to shoot bad , because you shoot in any direction  --  backward , sideways , or whatever  --  without worrying about blowing somebody 's head off . I knew what old Sandy would be doing when I stepped into the dark , dripping grove . He would have suggested to the birds that they move to the outer edge of the pine thicket , so that they  | would have a nice clear field of soggy broom grass to fly over on their way to the swamp . I was pretty well trained by now . The dogs had been working on me for a couple of years , and the Old Man said he was surprised , that sometimes I showed as much bird sense as a half-trained puppy , and there was hope that I might grow up to where the dogs need n't be ashamed of me . Sandy had herded the covey to the edge of the thicket , surer enough , and old Frank had come up on his right flank , inside the thicket , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do was show a little common intelligence and walk along the left wing , outside the thicket , and when I came abreast of Sandy 's nose Frank would run in from the right and Sandy would charge straight ahead and the birds would flush , leaving both me and the birds in the open . Then all I had to do was shoot some . It was an enormous great covey  --  about twenty or twenty-five birds in it . Either it was two shot-over coveys that had got together , or one that had been missed entirely ; I reckoned it was the latter . When Frank roared in from the right and old Sandy broke point and jumped into the birds , they got up in a cloud and fanned perfectly past me , giving me the best shot there is  --  a three-quarter straightaway where you lead just a little and let the shot string out behind your chosen bird . This was jackpot day . Lots of times I had killed two birds with one shot , which is always an accident . You pick one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocks off another . I held on one of the front-flying cocks and pulled , and the whole doggone sky fell down . I stood there with my mouth open , just watching the rest of the birds sideslip into the edge of the swamp , and did n't bother to shoot the left barrel . The dogs started to fetch  --  even Sandy , who does n't care much about it as a steady job , because he reckons any damfool dog can pick up a dead bird and fill his mouth full of loosc feathers . But they were interested in this job , because by the time they finished collecting the enemy I had six birds in my coat with one shot . The answer , of course , was very simple . Just as I  | pulled on the cock bird some of his relatives executed a cavalry maneuver and did a flank on him , and I simply fired right down the line , raking the face of the flank . Sandy brought the last bird and spat him out on the ground and looked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , Sandy was saying . By the time he gets home , he 'll think he did it on purpose . This time next year it 'll be twelve birds when he tells it . Frank laughed and nodded agreement . We hunted through the sopping woods , and everywhere a covey of birds was supposed to be , a covey of birds was . I could n't miss anything that day . I had to use two barrels on one single , was all , and I got that extra barrel back again a little later . It was just one of those days when all the birds got up right , pasted flat within an inch of the dog 's nose before they rose . The singles clung to the ground like limpets , and you literally had to kick them up . Birds fly slower when they 're waterlogged , and it was pretty near murder . The extra barrel I got back , to make the score perfect for the day , was a present from Frank . I shot into the last covey and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise . Frank fetched both birds and then disappeared into the big , spooky black swamp into which the rest of the covey had flown . A year ago I would have thought he was acting like an idiot , but , as I said , the dogs had trained me pretty good , and Frank , of all dogs , was no covey chaser . I reckoned that I had hit another bird and wounded him without knowing it , and that Frank had seen a leg drop , or something . I sat down on a stump and let the rain punish my face , and old Sandy sat down by me and shrugged his shoulders as an adult will when he can not control a child . If that dam f ool dog wants to go drown himself in that swamp on a wild-goose chase , Sandy said with his shrug , let him . Not for me , bud . There are too many birds around . Frank was gone for nearly half an hour . When he came back , he was wetter than a drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . He had evidently chased the runner for half a mile . I cracked the fugitive 's neck and shoved him in my coat and went  | back to the store to collect the Old Man . He laughed out loud when we came into the bright warmth of Mr. Cox 's potbellied stove . We must have been a sight  --  wet dogs , wet boy , wet coat full of bedraggled birds . The Old Man is real clever . " How many shells ? " he asked . " Nine . " " How many birds ? " " Fifteen , " I said , with pardonable pride . " Do n't tell me how it happened right now , " the Old Man said . " I want to get you out of those wet clothes , and I reckon I 'll need a little spot of nerve medicine to make me strong enough to listen to the bragging . But tell me one thing : was I right about February bird shooting ? " " Yessir , " I said . " But then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That , " the Old Man declared , as we walked out into the rain and climbed into the Liz , " is a very sage observation from one so young , and I am highly flattered . If it 'll make you feel any better , I made all my mistakes when I was young , which is the difference today between an old man and a boy . Youth is for making mistakes , and old age is for impressing the young with your knowledge . My Lord , it 's an awful day , is n't it ? " " It 's a beautiful day , " I said .  | 20 March Is for Remembering " March , " the Old Man said , " is a fine month for remembering . I suppose that 's because there is really nothing else you can do in it . Do n't ever let anybody tell you that getting old happens in the autumn of your life . It happens in March . " The Old Man and I were sitting , just sitting , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your worst enemy . The wind was blowing fit to split your teeth , so that your skin felt as if it was currycombed every time you walked out of doors . A few flowers had poked their heads up , and then a new frost nobody 'd counted on arrived and the flowers ducked their heads right back again . It was just a touch too early for the geese to he flying north . Everything was finished  --  the quail season was over , and  | the fishing had n't started , and in those days there was n't any television . I got up and started to pace , like a nervous cat when it 's raining outside . The Old Man watched me walk a bit and then he sort of giggled under his mustache . He liked it right where he was . He did n't want to walk ; he was n't headed anywhere . " Offhand , " he said , " I would surmise there ai n't nothing wrong with you that calomel ca n't cure . But if you 'll settle down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's this : Nobody ever got any younger , because if they had I would of heard of it , and maybe bought some . So what a man has got to do is take a little time off as he grows older , and devote the waste space to remembering the things he did that he maybe wo n't never do again . That 's how you get your muscles back . It 's also a fine preventative against the nervous indigestion . And when you get tired of thinking about all you 've done , you can always use the time thinking about what you 'd like to do in the future . You done anything lately you admired ? " I said , " Yessir , several things . " " Well , boy , " the Old Man suggested , " suppose you sort of rehash ' em in your head and then tell me what it was like to do ' em . Just for instance , " he said , " I bet you that you wo n't remember much of the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot that day you came home full of the brags . " There had never been a day like the day I shot the four geese and came home full of the brags . I had had an accidental day with the fifteen quail on nine shots , but accidents do n't count . Everybody touches perfection once ; I touched it that day and knew I had it in my hand . But I had n't tried to appraise it . I just knew I had it . It happened like this : I was down in the east end of the state with some friends , down around Hatteras , and it was a fine big year for the old Canada honkers . By " fine " I mean nobody was shooting very many , because they would sit out there on the wide water until the shooting time was finished , and then they 'd fly into the cornfields to feed . They must have been operating by  | stop watch , because you could hear ' em holler when the legal shooting was done , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not having much else to do , I kept betting that some day they were going to get their time-check signals fouled , and some of those geese would flock in off the big water a bit early , and I would be there when they came . So I made me a nest in a ditch in the cornfield and waited ' em out with two shotguns , both I 2 'S and both doubles . I did n't want to be undergunned when they did decide to arrive an hour early . I had both guns loaded with No. i bucks . In my youthful enthusiasm I reckoned that if No. is were big enough for a deer they were big enough for a goose , if you could hit a goose with ' em . Every day I went and sat in my little hidey-hole in the corn shucks . Every day the geese came in just after the curfew . Every day I got up and went off with the two guns . The reason I did n't cheat was fairly simple . the Old Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game wardens he was going to be on the side of the game wardens , and I could stay in jail and rot for all he cared . He said game laws were made on purpose , so you 'd have some game to shoot next year . There was that day I changed loads and shot a crow at a great distance because there were n't going to be any geese and I was bored . I shot him with an old thirty-incher double , full-choked , and he dropped like a stone at about sixty yards . There was another day I shot some doves , because the geese were still in a high V , talking , but not seriously , about dinner . But finally I learned the value of patience , and just sat there without shooting . I reckoned the geese would come some day , and they would be more apt to come if I did n't loose off at crows and doves . It was late in the fall and the corn shucks were stained brown by frost , the crisp yellow leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of yellow nubbin ears on the crazy-bending stalks , with the dried-out dark brown whiskers at the top of the cars and the husks split to show the seed inside . It was Iona '  | some , like it can get to be lonesome in a cornfield , because there is nothing I know of as shambly and dilapidated as an old cornfield . But there was still food a-plenty , and the honkers knew it . They would n't leave it until they finished it . And they had n't even begun to finish it . A late-autumn day is a wonderful thing , all by itself , because in hog-killing time the sun is bloody red from the wood smoke of a fire that 's always going on somewhere . The ground gets gray and cold and hard in the late afternoon , and you find that your fingers stiffen from about three-thirty until you go home to the fire . All the lonesome sounds start earlier in the late fall : the scattered quail trying to call each other back into a covey ; a cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crow 's caw sounding wistful instead of ornery . And then you have the goose sound . It is n't a gabble . It is n't really a honk . It just sounds like a goose , and it will never sound like anything else as the old gander lifts his gaggle off the lake or off the Sound and issues the correct instructions about where his herd is headed . A goose in the air is music . It is sad music when you know the goose is not apt to light , and beautiful music when he makes that big landing circle and stops his wings , holding them slanted in the cold , clean air , losing altitude and gliding down in a decreasing flight pattern until he drops his legs and bumps into a rocky landing . The thing about a goose is he 's a keen looker . He 'll drop that snaky neck and shove his head down and check the terrain before he does anything at all about it . That is when you do n't move an eyeball , not when a goose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I got a lot older , I shot blue geese in Louisiana , and they would even come in to a bad call , if they were young enough and had lost mama . They would also come in to a sheet of newspaper stuck on a stick or a dead cousin propped up on the ground . But this one day I had in mind the geese left the water early . I held still in my cramped little hide-out in the ditch and looked at the three landing circles without getting nervous and without  | shooting too soon . I did n't move the barest part of a muscle , and when the old fifteen-pounder decided it was safe to land he said a word to the flock and they dropped in low . I shot two coming . I dropped one gun and picked up the other and shot two going . Possibly I never saw anything in my life like four geese , all seemingly dropping at once . They fell like shot-down aircraft and hit the deck with a thump like a bomb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shoved a fresh load into the gun I was holding and held the bead on his head , and he quit leaving the premises . The indignation in the sky was considerable . When the old gander came plummeting down and the other three fell out of the flock , there was a flat accusation of betrayal , and the survivors pushed on south , complaining bitterly as they flew . I could n't begin to describe the emotions . When you 've got four dead Canada geese on the ground at once , you do n't know which one to pick up first . I ran from one to the other like a nervous old lady , and then I decided I would just pick up the geese as I found them , starting with the first two that I shot coming , and winding up with the last one that I had to give the finisher to . To me , a coat with ten quail in it is still a big event . But four Canada geese , four old ringnecks , is a feast , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say how a small boy carried two big i 2-bore shotguns and four mature honkers , but I managed . I think maybe I could have flown the load home with one hand . To pluck a goose takes time , especially if you want the dry down to stuff a pillow with . To pluck four takes a lot of time , but somehow it was time I did n't mind spending . The old boss gander was tougher than whitleather , but I ate him happily . The others tasted not much better . The guns , I thought , had a new dignity , because I had never met anybody who had killed four Canada geese in one salvo . I felt like a man who would never again shoot less than four Canada geese . This is what I tried to tell the Old Man . " It was as if I had shot  | four elephants , " I said . " I never had such a big day in all my life , with the exception of the one when we got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , pushing it gently toward me . " No , " he interrupted . " Do n't remember any more today , or people will say you 're a bore . You had enough remembering with the geese . You got to save some remembering for the next rainy day in March . But tell me one thing , what stood out the clearest about that day ? " " The day , " I answered , before I thought . " All of it . There really was n't anything bigger in it than all the little things in it . I felt lucky when I started it , sitting in the ditch in the cornfield , and I kind of knew that this was the one day for the geese to come in , and I knew I knew it . That was the only big thing . I knew it was going to be the right day for it . " " Well , " the Old Man warned , " remember one thing . When you start remembering again , remember that there ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that go to make up the day . This 'll give you considerable comfort when you 're as old as me . Do you understand what I 'm driving at ? " " Yessir , " I said , because this was getting too deep for me . " I sure do . " I sure did n't , actually . I just wanted to get off the platform . But now today I do . I remember very carefully , even a war , and there is n't any one event in any day I remember that was bigger than what I had for breakfast .  | 21 You Got to Be Crazy to Be a Duck Hunter The day was slaty , and the wind whipped the Sound into a froth . The clouds tumbled low and menacing , with a suspicion of snow to come . My ears seemed to catch fire when we came into the warmth of the house , and little droplets clung to my nose . My hands were wrinkled from cold water and as red as radishes . There was no feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was never happier in my life . " Just look at the pair of us , " the Old Man said . " Froze stiff , probably going to die of the pneumonia , wet , muddy , and miserable , and both of us grinning at each other like Chessy cats . We 're crazy as loons , but then you got to be a little crazy to be a duck hunter . Nobody in his right mind would get up before dawn to sit and freeze in a blind on the off chance that some old  | buck mallard full of fish will fly close enough to get missed . " We had had quite a day . The wind that tumbled the waters had broken up the enormous rafts of ducks  --  you know , the ones that sit so maddeningly in the middle of the bay on a bluebird day . The low ceiling had ' em well down within range , and the wind had also blown the water out of the little secret pools . As happens only once in a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they came to the decoys like cats to catnip . " There ai n't nothing , " the Old Man said , " as smart as a black mallard when the weather 's with him . He can see from here to Japan , and he can spot a phony decoy from a mile high , which is generally where he 's at . But you let that weather change and blow up a lot of wind , and mebbe a little snow , and there ai n't nothing as stupid as a duck . That goes for geese too , and I reckon the old honker is generally smarter than the duck . You get the right weather , and you have to bat ' em out of the blind . How about that fellow today that lost his mama ? " The Old Man was talking about a two-thirds-grown Canada goose that had strayed off from the V , up there in the dirty gray sky , and was making pitiful sounds . The Old Man had snickered at it . " Some of them big fellows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fellow will be real fine for your grandma 's oven . See , now , how I call him down . I am going to make some noises like his mama . " He got out his goose call and began to talk like a goose 's mama . I have no way of writing down the sounds , but you could sec that lost goose stick his neck down as soon as the Old Man 's wheedling call reached him . He dropped his flaps and cane down out of the sky like a hawk after a fish . He came practically into the blind , and I took a whack at him and discovered I had done one of those things you do once in a blue moon  --  shot my gun dry and plumb forgot to load her . The goose took off , and the Old Man said , " Do n't worry . Load her up and I 'll call him back . Shoot him good this time , or we 'll have him in the blind with us . " He set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back to the blind . This time I was loaded with 4 'S , and I delivered a mess right into his head and neck , and he came down like a rock . " It 's a mean trick , " the Old Man said , " but you can always call a lost young goose with that mama noise . And they do eat better than the old ones . " The Old Man had shot behind live decoys in his time ; it had been legal . You 'd have a hen mallard tied to a stick that was stuck in the mud , and she had more conversation than a woman . She would stand on her tail and flutter her wings and talk sexy to the passing flocks , and they would turn on a dime and come in with their feet hanging out and wings cocked . There is no easier target than a fat mallard or pintail grabbing for water with his feet and his wings locked . Well , the wind stirred the water to a devil 's broth , the ducks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mallards were the prettiest , of course , but it was the pins that the Old Man admired most . " The French duck is gaudy , " he said , " with his yellow shoes and all those colors in his plumage and that big yellow shovel for a bill , but you ca n't trust him . He 's a puddle duck , and if you do n't give him enough grain he 'll double-cross you and eat himself sick on fish , just like any old merganser . But not the pin . Look at the gentlemanly clothes he wears , while the mallard looks like a pool-hall sharpie . You 'll never find a pintail eating fish . He 'd starve first . " I know you read a lot about the canvasback and how fine he is to eat , and how all the politicians in this neck of the woods wo n't eat anything but terrapin and canvasback at their big dinners , but the old can ai n't got any more morals than a mallard about eating fish . The only big duck I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ducks , I never ate a fishy teal so far . As a matter of fact , when all is said and done , for the dinner plate you ca n't beat a teal . " Ducks . . . " the Old Man said . " Now , take teal . They fly fastcr'n greased lightning , and on a teal in a tail wind you got to lead him thirty foot . But they will skitter in amongst the decoys  | right while you 're blam-blamming at a bunch of other ducks , and swim around like they owned the pond . It do n't make sense . Once you got a teal on the water , you practically ca n't scare him off it , ' less you shoot at him . " I mentioned casually that we seemed to waste an awful lot of ammunition shooting cripples , and that the few belts I had at teal , sitting , usually resulted in the teal 's taking off to Mexico . " I ca n't explain it all to you , " the Old Man replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water is like an iceberg . About eight-tenths of him is under water , and water sheds shot like a tin roof . You practically got to hit him in the head to kill him , because his wings are folded and the wing feathers and the back feathers 'll shed shot just like water . I 've noticed that in all sorts of bird shooting it 's a heap easier to shoot a flying bird than a sitting bird , all question of sportsmanship aside . A flying bird opens up his vulnerable parts , his softer-feathered parts , and he spreads his wings enough to give you a chance to bust one . Sitting , wings folded , he 's damned near armor-plated . " And there 's one thing more : standing in a boat or a blind and aiming down at water does something to the shotgun pattern . Do n't ask me what or how , because I du n no . But shotguns were made to shoot either up or straight out , not down . A smarter man than me could probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , though , is to watch , on the next cripple , how irregular the pellets strike the water . " The Old Man and I were not steady permanent-blind boys . He was against it . Said the ducks got to associate the blind with noise and the sudden death of a relative , and would skirt it just enough to pass outside good range , unless it was such a dirty day that they completely lost their minds and became as crazy as duck hunters . " The way to do it , " he said , " is in a bateau . The Cajuns call it pirogue , ' but bateau  --  which is French for boat , ' my ignorant young friend  --  is a flat-bottomed skiff . You pole her out to whcrc the wind and water seem right , and stick her in a bunch of reeds or rushes , and you cut yourself some roseaux , or tules  --  which is  | French and Spanish , respectively , for reeds , ' and build your blind around your boat . You always wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep your face down until you are ready to shoot , because anything but a teal or a bluebill will see your white face or bald head from as high up as he can fly , and all the decoys and calls in the world wo n't get him down  --  unless , like I said , the weather 's so lousy they 've quit caring . You peep through a little hole in the reeds , and you let them circle your blind twice , unless it 's a very clear day , and on the second circle they 'll decoy like cream . " A man with patience will kill an awful lot of ducks , because when they drop those feet and lock those wings you get the first one automatic , and all you got to do is like the Cajun said  --  aim at the nose when the other half is climbing . A mallard looking for sky when he 's just left the water is not really moving very fast , because he 's fighting for altitude and his centrifugal force is all out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man what centrifugal force was . Like I 've said so many times , if you asked him he was apt to tell you , and it would take an hour or so , and everybody from Julius Caesar to Einstein would get mixed up in it . The Old Man read me a lot of lectures about trash ducks and ducks that ought to be conserved . He would n't ever let me shoot a wood duck , because he said they were too pretty and too little , and besides , there were n't enough of them to go around . He never would shoot a gray duck or a spoonbill if anything else was flying , and when I complained that they looked like hen mallards at a distance he said I ought to sharpen up my eyesight or quit mingling with grown men . I took a crack at a swan once , and the Old Man took a crack at me . He said they were n't any good to eat and there were dodlimbed few of them around and what there was ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in those days of practically nonexistent game wardens , abundant game , and large limits , one thing stands out about the Old Man . He never willingly took more fish or game than we could cat or give away , and he ncvcr  | shot a gun  --  or allowed me to shoot a gun  --  just to hear it go off and kill something useless . He was absolutely firm about leaving a nucleus of game , whether it was quail or deer , and of never shooting females if the females were identifiable . This sex definition did not , of course , apply to quail or ducks , because unless it 's mallards close at hand or a quail flying at you , there just is n't time enough to tell . But it seems to me I 've been rattling around all over the place , and what I really wanted to concentrate on was what the Old Man said first , which is that it takes a crazy man to be a duck hunter . As we stood in front of the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death by drowning , exposure , and pneumonia , after having been up since black night , after having rowed and poled miles , after having frozen fingers setting out decoys and having frozen feet from inactivity  --  after having been uncomfortable constantly in the quest for a few pounds of bird meat that I did n't like to eat too terribly well , I concluded one thing : if you have to be crazy to hunt ducks , I do not wish to be sane .  | 22 X Plus Y to the Second Power Equals Bluefish I think the subject came up because of some very bad marks on the report card , mostly having to do with algebra and Chaucer . Miss Hetty Struthers taught the algebra , and Miss Emma Martin taught the Chaucer , and I could n't get anywhere with either one . My folks tore a small strip off me , and I was complaining bitterly to the Old Man one Sunday when we were going off to investigate the late run of bluefish . " It do n't make any sense to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning things like Whan that Aprillc with its shoures sooty the droghte of Marche hath perced to the root v ' ? I can make more sense out of Gcechec talk . At least when I ask a Gcechec , Boy , where you get don rope ? ' and he says , ' Alan , I  | t'ief ' urn off de dock , ' I know what he 's saying . I know he stole the rope . " " Well , everything 's got some uses , " the Old Man said mildly , tying a slipknot in a leader . " Maybe even Chaucer 'll come in handy some day , although I must say I go along with you on this old English . We speak a lot of old English around here , such as holp ' for help , and we call a bed a stid , ' which I suppose is short for bedstead , and we say twig , ' which I understand is Cockney for look . ' " " Yessir , " I said , " but we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we spell better than they spelled in those days , and I just do n't see no sense in it , a-tall . How 's it going to help me make a living ? " " Well , since time began , " the Old Man said , " they have been jamming a lot of old stuff down young fellers because it is supposed to give ' em culture and make ' em think . What 's your excuse for the D ' in algebra ? " " Please , sir , you 're not going to stand there and tell me that x plus y divided by z equals q ? You taught me fractions by cutting up apples , and I understood that , especially when I ate the fractions . But this business of y to the third power is the cube root of p times 10 just do n't rub off . What good is it ? " " I du n no , " the Old Man admitted . " Maybe something will come of it , and maybe you ought to know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on a fish boat all your life ? " " Yes , " I said stubbornly . " If it means Chaucer and algebra , I 'd rather work on the Vanessa with Tom and Pete , and make liquor in the wintertime . " " That ai n't any sort of an answer , " the Old Man told me . " Mind , now , you 're cutting that mullet too thick . You 'll be going to college one of these days , and then you can study what you want to study , but first you got to get out of high school . And to get out of high school you got to make yourself do a lot of unpleasant things , which is how life works . It ai n't all one way , you know . IIand me a sinker .  | " Bear this in mind . Knowledge is an accumulation , like a pack rat hides things . Things you never knew you knew have a way of popping up later .

That ai n't a threat . It 's a suggestion . Let 's go catch some fish . " We caught a lot of fish . The big blues had come in to feed in the sloughs , and so had the drum  --  the channel bass , that is ? and there was a big run of enormous weakfish . We 'd had a pretty good norther that had cut deep sloughs and firmed up the sand bar , and all you had to do was just give the rod a little flip , and the four-ounce pyramid sinker landed right in the mouth of something big and full of fight . I caught a thirty-pound drum that day , and the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were tired , and we had enough fish to fill up the back seat of the Liz . We went home dead beat , and for once the Old Man helped me gut and scale the fish . There were just too many for one boy . We ate  --  not much , because I was tired ; just some cornbread and milk and eggs and bacon and jelly  --  and I went to bed , but I could n't sleep . Algebra and Chaucer kept chasing themselves round and round in my head , all mixed up with bluefish and channel bass and quail and camp making and horse riding and heaven and hell and how long is forever  --  one of those bad nights a kid 'll have once in a blue moon . About 2:00 A.M. I got up and dressed and called the dogs and went for a walk down by the river . The moon was nigh full , still sailing high and pretty in the sky , and all over town you could hear the dogs howl , like somebody was going to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get one thing out of my mind : " You ca n't pour a gallon of knowledge into a one-quart brain , " the Old Man had said . I wandered sad and lonely as a  | cloud  --  we 'd had that one in English too  --  wondering if I was one of those people with a one-quart brain . One pint was more like it , I thought finally as we walked down to the wharf , and I sat and dangled my feet and watched the moon turn the water to milk . Then I began to think of something else . I thought about how many things I already knew that the Old Man had taught me . These things skipped through my head helter-skelter . I knew how to train a puppy to be a good bird dog . I knew how to call a turkey or a duck . I knew how to row a boat and stand a deer . I knew about moon and tide and their effect on fish and game . I knew that a sea turtle wept huge tears when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to hook a sheepshead with a sand fiddler . I knew how to make a camp and build a fire and skin a rabbit in one shuck . I knew how to cook in the woods and throw a cast net and lead a dove and grapple an oyster and draw a seine . I suddenly decided I knew an awful lot about an awful lot of things , some of which I had been taught , some of which I had learned on my own . But mostly it seemed to me that what I knew  --  the odd pieces of information , like not calling the Aphrodite of Melos the Venus de Milo , and how the guano birds worked  --  all came out of the Old Man . It seemed to me that if they put the Old Man to work teaching school he could even make algebra easy . It also seemed to me that if a boy worked half as hard learning Chaucer as he worked hunting a coon , Chaucer would become a minor nuisance and could easily be got out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big buck deer , and probably had less mathematics to it . Whereupon I whistled up the dogs and went back to bed , and this time I slept . Then a strange and wonderful thing happened to me in the schoolroom . I discovered reading . Real reading . I found out that Shakespeare had more muscles than Doonie Watts and was responsible for more rough characters than a water front . He knew more man-type jokes than the boys at Gus McNeill 's  | filling station , and his language was frank enough to be of great interest to a boy . I took on Shakespeare as I 'd learned to build a turkey blind , and he was a cinch . I had more fun with Walter Scott than Ivanhoe ever did . I fell afoul of some naturalists like Ernest Thompson Seton , and some archaeologists , and some Gibbon , and I got so interested in Rome that I practically bought myself a toga . The Greeks and the Egyptians and the Phoenicians got to be personal friends . Robin Hood and Treasure Island and Robinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Defoe had a lot of know-how , and while Mr. Wyss ' Swiss Family Robinson was a bunch of lies , mainly , it also had a lot of know-how in it . I mean about salting down fish and taming onagers and building tree houses and such as that . The shock that I actually liked all this came one day when I was hunting with a friend of mine named E. G. Goodman , who was going to grow up to be a doctor like his dead daddy , even if his mamma , Mis ' Eliza Goodman , had to beat him with a stick . The E. in his name stood for Erasmus or Erastus , I disremember which , but if you called him " Ras " you had to fight him . G. and I had a real fine day at his farm . We hunted everything , like boys will  --  rabbits and squirrels and doves and quail . We were up before the dawn and bedded down early . We ate like starving Armenians and must have walked a hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care what he chased . That was the first day I really got into the texture of things . I mean , how big was a scuppernong grape , how much juice was inside it , what the moss on an old live oak looked like , the freckles on the leaves of an old cornstalk , the weight of a beefsteak tomato served with sugar and vinegar , the way a possum skin tacked to the weathered silver-gray boards of the smokehouse curled at the edges , the differing voice range of the bull hound when he was after a black swamp rabbit or was interested in a squirrel up a tree .
