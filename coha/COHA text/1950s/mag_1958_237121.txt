Hurok sheepishly admitted that he was fired from the job " because the dispatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong corners . " <P> Ex-Prime Minister Clement Richard Attlee , since 1956 a member of the House of Lords ( as the first Earl Attlee ) , described his move from the skirmishing of active politics : " It 's like sipping champagne that has been on the table for five or six days , " ungallantly proposed a mode of address for the first soon-to-be-appointed female members of Lords : " I should think they would be called Baron Ladies , and with considerable justice , I am sure .
