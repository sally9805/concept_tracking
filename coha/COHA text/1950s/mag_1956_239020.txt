Time was when Japan 's cheap prints of almond-eyed prostitutes , grimacing kabuki actors and brawling porters were as popular as penny dreadfuls , and treated with no more regard . Few Japanese mourned their passing when they fell early victims in Japan 's Westernization drive , and it was left to European artists-Renoir , Monet , et al. - to recognize them as minor masterpieces of art . But today , spurred on by a growing group of artists who have revived the neglected art of printmaking , hanga ( block-print picture ) art is beginning to bloom again . Most recent international recognition : a first prize at Venice 's Biennale ( TIME , July 9 ) , awarded to the wild man of Japanese hanga artists , squat , myopic Shiko Munakata , 50 , who also won a first prize in last year 's Sao Paulo Bienal . <P> " I Love That ! " Fellow artists like to say that " Munakata is kamigakari-obsessed with God , " and at work Munakata vividly demonstrates why . Kneeling before his low work table with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a sumi ( black-ink ) drawing he has pasted to a block of Judas-tree wood . Suddenly he seizes his chisel and , in a fury of motion , starts jabbing at the block , banging away with the mallet as the chips fly in all directions . <P> Sweat drenches his tousled black hair as he cleans the carved block , then splashes it with jet-black ink . Finally he selects a sheet of thin paper , carefully centers it on the block and begins pressing it with violent scrubbing motions . Cautiously peeling off the paper , he shouts : " Horete Iru ! " ( I love that ! ) , then bursts into croaking laughter . <P> Divinities &; Nudes . Munakata and his fellow hanga artists take for their subjects anything from nudes to Buddhist divinities , treat them in styles ranging all the way from medieval prints to posterlike realism . And in one important respect modern Japanese artists break sharply with the old print masters . Instead of merely drawing the designs for woodcuts , then handing them over to craftsmen to carve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way through , from sketch to finished work . The result : a more expressive art form , bearing the stamp of individuality throughout the work . <P> Among Prizewinner Munakata 's leading fellow artists : <P> Koshiro Onchi , who died last year at 64 , pioneered in new techniques and materials , printing from wood blocks that incorporated anything from rubber heels and fish fins to leaves and string to get the textures he wanted . <P> Kiyoshi Saito , 49 ( TIME , Sept. 10 , 1951 ) , probably the biggest seller of the current wood-block artists , who earlier this year exhibited his work in a traveling U.S. show that went from Boston to San Francisco and Seattle . He frankly admits that he came to woodcuts through Gauguin , rocked Japanese art circles when the first Sao Paulo Bienal jury passed over Japan 's painting entries to award a prize to Saito ( for a woodcut ) and Tetsuro Komai ( for an etching ) .                  @ @ @
