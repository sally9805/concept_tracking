In the struggle for power in the Middle East , alignments were shifting . <P> Pivot of the shift was Jordan , which in nine years has been transformed from a quiet Bedouin kingdom to a turbulent and strife-torn nation dominated by Palestine Arabs . The crisis in Jordan was misleadingly billed by Arabs and Israelis alike as strictly an " internal " Jordanian affair . It was anything but that . Jordan is an artificial country carved out of the desert , and can not live without support from somebody . Ever since the British abdicated , King Hussein 's chaotic and impoverished kingdom has been open to every neighbor 's intervention . During last fall 's Sinai war , neighboring Arab states sent in forces to " protect " Jordan against possible Israeli attacks . At Mafrak , 3.000 Syrians are encamped , dedicated to the proposition that Jordan is rightly part of Greater Syria . Farther south , 5,500 Saudi troops occupy two points near Jericho , as well as the Aqaba area long claimed by Saudi Arabian kings as their own . Iraqi troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the most effective army of all , watches anxiously from the west . <P> Common Fear . In the Jordan showdown , army and Cabinet leftists were working for some sort of federation with Syria and Nasser 's Egypt . But when the King moved against them , Iraq 's King Feisal and Saudi Arabia 's King Saud forgot their old rivalries to join in backing Hussein against any Syrian army intervention . <P> What unites the three kings is a common fear of the Communist influence that Nasser and the Syrian army extremists have brought into the Middle East by their arms deals . Within the past month both Saud and Feisal have heard ex-Congressman James Richards , President Eisenhower 's special representative in the <P> Middle East ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , explain the new U.S. policy for opposing Middle East Communism , and have signed agreements under the U.S. 's emergency $200 million aid program . Hussein , who last week began a purge of Communist and pro-Egyptian elements from Jordan 's army , schools and government offices , is convinced that only U.S. aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week his new Cabinet was debating whether to risk stirring up Jordan 's street crowds by inviting Ambassador Richards to Amman . <P> Common Complaint . But if the three kings seemed to have cut loose from Nasser on East-West issues , they appeared bent on making it up to their brother Arab by re-emphasizing their solidarity against Israel . After the U.S. flag tanker Kern Hills , on Israeli charter , sailed through the Gulf of Aqaba to unload Iranian oil at the Israeli port of Elath , the Saudis informed U.N . Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold that they considered the gulf a closed Arab sea , and that if Israeli ships tried to pass they would " oppose " them . In rapid succession Iran , Iraq , Syria , and even the West 's staunch friend Lebanon , registered their solidarity with Nasser over the gulf passageway .
