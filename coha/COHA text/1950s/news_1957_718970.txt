txt Governor Furcolo today offered an increase in the cityandLtown share of the revenue from the proposed sales tax as a major ? concession to obtain passage of the controversial 3 per cent limited leiry . The proposal , by which the cities and towns would get three-fourths of the sales-tax revenue rather than two-thirds , was offered at a conference attended by Senator EdWard C. Stone ( R ) of Barnstable , leader of the Republican legislative forces seeking major income-tax concessions as - the price of passage of the sales tax . The cOnference  --  Was also ' attended by Joseph P. Healey , state Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation ; Charles Mahoney , executive assistant to the Governor ; Charles D. Sloan , the Governor 's special counsel , and Representative Edwin D. Gorman , ( D ) of Holyoke . The new Furcolo offer was in addition to previous proposals to increase basic income tax exemptions by $500 and to increase from $400 to $600 the allowance for each dependent child . Countermove Seen ? As reported by some of the , conferees , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered by Senator Stone , chairman of the Leg ; . illative Committee on Taxation . It is reported that Senator Stone proposed a reduction in the basic rate om earned income from 21/4 per cent to 2 ' per cent , and a similar cut in the basic 6 per cent rate on unearned income , plus other inecate-tax revisions . It is understood the Governor stood firm against such a plan . Meanwhile , the taxation committee postponed until midafternoon its executive session on the Governor 's original plan for sales-tax plus . income-tax cuts . ' The postponement was voted after a motion by Senator Stone , who , sought additional time for further compromise efforts . The committee vote came after a =brief battle between the members , some of whom were strongly opposed to postponement and wished to report adversely the Governor 's plan without delay . ? Increase Estimated The new Furcolo offer is actually being presented before the committee by Mr. Gorman , who has served as the Governor 's spokesman in previous . committee . sessions . Although Mr. Gorman did not connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering an amendment to the pending bill to increase from two-thirds to three-fourths the municipal share of-revenue from the proposed sales tax . On the basis of the Governor 's original estimate that $112,500,000 would be raised annually by the sales tax , the municipal share thus would be increased from 75 million dollars to 84 million dollars . Some time ago such organizations as the Massachusetts Federation of Taxpayers Associations and the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce , ardent advocates of the sales tax , proposed increasing the city and town share . Special Message ? If the proposal were adopted along with the 24 million to 25 million dollars in income-tax cuts proposed by the Governor , the state itself would actually make a net gain in taxes of about 16 million dollars . This figure would include 28 million dollars from the sales tax , minus about 12 million dollars in revenue lost through the income-tax cuts . The cities and towns would have a net gain of about 72 million - dollars ? 84 million dollars from the sales tax minus 12 million or more in their share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxation committee should go along with the Governor on his new proposal he may be forced to send in a new special message to wipe out technical barriers now present which might bar its consideration by the Legislature . Point-of-Order Threat As the situation now stands , legislative parliamentary experts say a point of order could be raised successfully against any plan differing in major provisions from the plan submitted by the Governor himself in his July 1 special message . As the tax issue headed toward a Beacon Hill climax , politics and political maneuvering constituted a major problem in reaching an acceptable compromise . ? While Senator Stone heads the compromise drive , it was apparent that Republican leaders are maneuvering so that any legislation proposed will have a Furcolo or Democratic label on it . Even though Republicans have long been far more enthusiastic for a sales tax than have Democrats in the Legislature , they do n't want to go to the November , 1958 , polls as having provided the majority of the votes for it , Meanwhile , the battle of words over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of Boston , Senate Minority Leader and most vocal of the sales-tax opponents , insisted a sales tax would be " Inequitable and impractical " and in effect a pay cut for every wage earner . Norman , executive director of the Massachusetts Federation of Taxpayers Associations , insisted the sales tax is " the only way to relieve property of its present impossible tax burden .
