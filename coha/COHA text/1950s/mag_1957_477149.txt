LET 'S have a teacher be murdered . " That suggestion was made instantly when I told my small class in creative writing that we would compose a story . These were preadolescents , from nine to twelve , and this was only the second time we had met . As I had planned the course , they were not ready to write individual stories , but I 'd thought we would spend one session discussing-a plot , chiefly to give inc a chance to see how their minds were working . I would not guide them in this , I said : the story would be all theirs ? and would someone propose a subject ? The murdering of a teacher came out at once . The class accepted it with enthusiasm . I was startled but tried not to show it . I simply said , " It 's your story , and how are you going to work it out ? " But I wondered why , of all possible subjects , this was the one that had burst from their minds . The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier . Why were n't they thinking of baseball , of swimming , camping , the annual pet show , or their vacation reading ? I assumed that their choice was not accidental . Since I am a writer , I know something aboutthe connection between one 's subconscious turmoil and the creative expression that springs up most spontaneously . There might be a clue here to some disturbance . . These were children , from different grades in all parts of the city , who had been especially invited to join a " creative workshop . " They were supposed to be high in scholastic rank and to have shown signs of creative talent . Their teachers had made the choices . It therefore did n't seem likely that there had been any personal animosity between the teachers and these particular pupils . Those who might stir up behavior problems had been ruled out specifically . Yet all of these youngsters were willing ? eager actually ? to imagine a teacher murdered . Why ? I would not probe for the answer . If there were any distressing emotion here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , without prompting . They did come out ? not as hints but as bald statements of the way teachers seem to these children who had been processed in modern schools . It is such a distorted view that at first I could not believe the children meant what they said , I protested , I argued , but I could not change the children 's opinion . They know their teachers , they said , and 1 do n't , and this is the way it is . The words they used were wrong , their interpretation was wrong . And surely something is wrong in their schoolrooms too , or these children would not sec their teachers in such a fantastic light . With the stark , honest view of the young , they may he sensing a situation that needs correcting . It is nothing that they can reveal to the teachers themselves , for the relationship as they see it makes frankness impossible . Meanwhile they go along with an impression that damages the learning process , and perhaps could damage a child 's whole development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might surprise the adults . Our creative workshop included instruction in drama , art , puppetry , modeling , papercraft , and writing . The leaders were not all professional teachers ; I was not . If any person was practicing an an or craft with some success and had an interest in children , he was considered qualified . Therefore the workshop had no schoolroom atmosphere . - The children could choose whatever class , or classes , they wished to join . Most of those in the writing class were , surprisingly , boys . They were youngsters , it turned out , who enjoyed reading and who already were conscious that writing requires a technique . We met one morning a week for eight weeks . I knew there would not be time in eight sessions to train them in grammar , nor did I think it important for them to do much writing themselves . I had only one objective : to leave in their minds a hint of what good writing is , and also what it is not . It is not writing produced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out . for the purpose of showing the writer 's cleverness , Good writing , I told the class , is communication : a thought , an experience , an impression that somebody wishes to share with others . The quality of the thought is what matters . Our discussions took us at once into essentials , into honest appraisals of our experience . At the end , the children 's remarks about teachers and schools seemed the most significant , but I want to mention other ideas their minds were playing with , in order to show what good minds they were , and what good emotional balance those particular children had ? that is to say , why their comments deserve a hearing . PLOTTING THE KILL T 0 GET the class outside the routine of thinking conventionally , we spent one session on words , on their origins . We asked ourselves how people communicated before there were words , and we tried to decide why one sound in the mouth , instead of another , was used ? as examples ? for clap , and dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize how the sound of the happening itself had been used for clap , thunder , patter , murmur , and crackle . We discussed the word dog , which came into the language late and is a puzzle to linguists . I believe one of the boys had the answer . I mentioned that once I had stood at one end of a corridor while a woman talked at the other end to a newsboy about his dog . The only word I could catch was dog , again and again , although all the rest remained a jumble . " Dog is a sound that carries a long way , " said this boy . " Early people probably named their pets dogs in order to call them . " That boy has a talent for analyzing . I asked the children to write down a list of their favorite words . Their choices would be almost universally pleasing : flame , throne , delicious , quiet , xylophone , sincere , shimmering , sparkle , and filmy : also , surprisingly , bundle , sandy , and eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained why I liked them , and the children later brought up the fact that I had . Teachers , they said , never express what they themselves think . By the second meeting we were well down in the level of consciousness from which a writer 's , or artist 's , creativity rises . That was the time I said that the class should make tip a plot . The boy who had analyzed dog suggested the subject , the murdered teacher . In the following discussion everything but the subject was a matter of controversy . As incidents were considered , they were put into the story , or rejected , on the basis of realism : " It would n't happen that , way , " or , " What they really would do is this . " Besides the children 's concern with the truth of the situation , I was impressed by the decency with which most of the characters were supposed to act . The criminal was made an automobile salesman . Everyone else in the story was courteous , honest , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six high-school pupils confessed to the crime because each of them thought that his best friend had done it and wanted to save him from punishment . Girls were allowed to share in the sacrifice . The boys in the class assumed that even girls had fine feelings . Aside from this youthful mass-martyrdom , the final plot was a good little mystery story , tight and logical when it was finished , and it was worked out entirely without my help . I said I was pleased with it ? praise that had a surprising effect , but that fact , again , I did not learn until later . When the plot was completed one boy said , " Of course this is nothing but a whodunit . " His remark started off a lively criticism of movies , radio , TV , and much of the literature now being produced for children . The class , they made clear , felt contempt for most of this fare , not only because many books are poorly written , as they could recognize , but because the subjects did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but one of the boys said : " You can hardly find anything written for children that is n't about space ships or else detectives . In these books children act as detectives . Even girls do . Everybody knows that children ca n't be detectives . " All through the course the children expressed a conscious distaste for anything phony , and an eager acceptance for everything honest . I told them my own definition of the best literature : writing that takes a common experience and describes it in such rich detail that we , as readers , begin to lead our own lives more fully . We begin to look for what we have been missing . That thought was immensely stimulating . It was something new to be conscious of sounds , tactile sensations , sights , and odors , and the children examined the room where we worked , smelling the curtains , the concrete walls , the furniture , trying to find the words that would best capture their qualities . Their environment seemed to be something that they were discovering for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conveying it often startled me , it was so expressive . Our talk ranged over many subjects . Someone thought that we must seem very slow to squirrels . He described a man under a tree , heavy and labored , as a squirrel would see him . " I think that time feels entirely different to a squirrel from the way that it feels to us , " said this boy . At the end we came back to the feeling in words themselves . " Dread , " said one ten-year-old , " has a deep , mournful sound , but if you say dreading , the ing kind of levels it out . It is n't as bad then . " TEACHERS , NOT PEOPLE A L L through the workshop sessions I had been surprised by the children 's perceptiveness . Their honesty had that fearlessness which is exciting wherever found , and more : in their limited frame of experience , these children had good judgment . I believed them , therefore , when one of the boys said : " We have been talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise . " " Would you all say that ? " I asked . They all nodded . They were a little uncomfortable and they told why : " Maybe you praised us just to encourage us . " I protested that I had not done that ? that people who do creative work , like writing , enjoy flashes of creativeness wherever they find them . It had given me personal satisfaction when the class talked poetically about chimes and clocks and squirrels . Had it been wrong to show feelings of pleasure ? Many times they had shown me their pleasure at subjects I had brought up . " It is n't wrung , but teachers do n't , ' ' I was told . " Teachers never praise anybody . " " They never do ? " I persisted . The children thought hard . One said that when he was in the fourth grade he met his first-grade teacher and she told him that he had done good . work when he was in her class three years earlier . That seemed like belated encouragement . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , if a teacher had a chance privately she might tell a pupil that he had been pretty good . " Why do you think they don't. praise you during the school year ? " I asked . " If a teacher praised one , that would make the other pupils all jealous . " The class agreed . This , I thought , shows from the children 's side the current attitude that the slowest mast not be made to feel inferior . It is called democracy . How many , who could do superior work with encouragement , are sacrificed so that the dullest can have the illusion of being smart ? I remembered what one of my friends , an English teacher trained several decades ago , had told me : that she had been taught to find something to praise in every theme turned in by a student . I said to my class , " But everyone could be praised for something . If a boy is not good at his studies , he could be praised for wearing a nice clean shirt . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were a nicer boy today than you were yesterday . ' let them absorb the thought and continued , " I am not suggesting that there should be teacher 's pets . But I , frankly , believe in praise . When I was a child , I needed it , I worked hard for it , and I got it . And when someone does something that seems excellent to me now , I would n't be real if I held hack my approval . To me that would seem like a kind of aloofness . " " But you are talking like people , " said one of the boys . " Teachers are never people . " Now I was the one needing time to absorb a thought . I asked , " How do you mean , they 're not people ? " " Well , you know what people are . Everybody knows . " Ile said this with an inclusive gesture . - But teachers are different . Teachers are n't people . " I asked the class if they knew what he meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure they had discussed the subject . " Teachers are people , " I told them . " They have headaches . They run out of money . They own pets , some of them . They have relatives . They are people the same as you and I are . " " Why do n't they act like people then ? " " Do n't they ever ? " I asked . " Not in school . They do n't act like people or talk like people . " That was the statement of one hay , but all agreed . I asked : " Did n't any of you ever have one teacher who seemed like a human being ? " These children had gone to school individually in several states and altogether they must have known between twenty and thirty teachers . A boy finally answered , " I did have one teacher who kind of acted the way people do . She was the only one . " Another boy said , " If you meet a teacher some place away from school , and nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hello ' almost the way people would . " They brought up another angle : " You have told us the things you like . Teachers would never do that . They never say what they think . " I did my utmost to explain teachers , to defend them , but I was too baffled just then to do a good job and at the end the youngsters were not convinced . When we separated they still were protesting that teachers " are n't really people . " I never would so have described any teacher I had . MI my teachers seemed live human beings . In this they were aided , I'll. admit , by the outdated custom of Having the Teacher to Dinner . When a teacher would sit at our dining table , unexpectedly beautiful in a silk dress I never had seen before , the conversation would fill in unknown details . The teacher perhaps had a brother who was a doctor ; she was born in Kalamazoo ; she liked apricots ; she lived with her parents ; she had a cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con-sider important ? the teacher became more a person , an individual . She was learning too about us . Now she knew that my father was born in Canada , that we spent our vacations there , that we liked sailing , that my brother 's hair came in curly after he had typhoid fever . She was certainly told that I was studying music seriously , practicing several hours a day , and perhaps she could sense any other stresses that there might be . In any case , now the teaching and learning process had taken on depth . It had been put on a natural basis . I know , at least , that I thought of my teachers as no different from neighborhood women or friends , and I'm. sure that those dinners were not the whole reason . In school and out of school they were like anyone else , except that they were especially concerned with helping me to grow ' up . There were four , however , who were so instrumental in helping me find myself that I ca n't imagine what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any less human . One was my second-grade teacher , a cripple . She was very strict and she seldom smiled , but in some way she made us know that she loved us . We returned the love with protective tenderness ; it was the greatest privilege when one was allowed to get her crutches or move her chair . She was the first cripple that I had known , and naturally her deformity made an impression , but the thing that gave her so great an influence was her character . I once heard a physician speak of his five-year-old son 's " fine adult reactions . " In my second-grade period I did n't have many fine adult reactions . I was just a. small girl , afraid of the dark , afraid of thunder , afraid of fires , and afraid of some large , vague menace ? a child 's first intimation that there is unfriendliness in her universe . What I wanted in any adult was what I believe that most children want : nobility , an absolutely dependable goodness on which the immature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cripple who had surmounted her problems could have had goodness in the degree Mrs. Paine had . To remember her still gives me a sense of security . The next of my stellar four was my fifth-grade teacher . By most parents ' standards she was a strange one , a gaunt woman who lived in a small dingy room in order to spend her money on summer trips to outlandish places . Most of the people our family knew who went " abroad , - followed a well-worn route : to England , Germany , France , and Italy . The Scandinavian countries and Spain almost marked one as unconventional . It is different now , but my teacher did not wait till the farthest outposts became respectable . She had gone to Mongolia , Burma , New Zealand : she had sailed around the Horn and visited Lapland and a place with the fabulous name of Zanzibar . She was no longer young but she went on some lengthy trip every year . coming back with her eyes more remote than ever , but with something wonderful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traveler would tell the class something about the countries that she had seen . But with me and two or three of the boys , she would share the whole story of her adventures . On occasional Friday afternoons we would go home with her . She would invite us to dinner , a simple meal cooked on her two-burner gas plate , and she would show us her souvenirs . There were bright , peculiar-shaped shoes , weird masks , stone weapons , gourd cooking utensils , a shrunken human head , and exotic jewelry . We would hold these things in our hands and the countries from which they came would rise right up before our eyes . And then , as we ate the teacher 's bean soup and bread pudding , she would describe the leaky , small boats in which she had sailed , the primitive families with whom she had stayed , the food , the smells , the sounds ? tales that showed us that there were other worlds besides this prosaic one with the Superior School at its center . Anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Alaska and learned that the North is my heart 's native land . It is possible that I would not have made that discovery except for this teacher-friend . NO PETS T HOSE visits to teachers ' houses never gave advantage at school . I know that the boys and I who were shown the traveler 's treasures had to work harder than other pupils to make our grades . There was never any suggestion that we were the teacher 's pets , and certainly never any Aunt Susan kind of familiarity . Children have an innate sense of fitness , and most of them can be trusted . Given a privilege , - I  - -  believe- they . - wciu- td  -- ant-Dverctep -- -so tong , that is , as the teacher remains an adult . If she plays with them on their own level , I have been told that the relationship may become confused . But no one could say that all teachers should adopt pupils as friends . Most teachers probably have more than enough of the company of the young by the time the day is over . It is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my writing class . Those boys soon will be in high school ? will they find there today men like the two who complete my foursome of outstanding people ? One taught chemistry , or , more than taught : he implanted chemistry in our minds , so forcefully nobody could resist . Yet he was not aggressive . I 'd guess that he 'd grown too fast ; for he still had the tall-boy 's loose , languid motions . He would sprawl over his desk , with one hand in his wild , thinning hair , and say whatever came into his mind with exciting candor . Those were the days before do-it-yourself became popular . He had painted his own house and one of the school board , passing on Saturday , had seen him up on the ridgepole and complained that he was undignified . The teacher reported this happening to us without comment , but with a wonderful merry smile . All pompousness was demolished with it . He often would discourse , wholesomely but realistically , about the relationships between men and women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail , but emotional sanity was discussed and I learned much more from him than from the inhibited woman botany-teacher who was assigned to the task of giving the girls ' gym classes some of the facts of life . And finally the Latin teacher : unknown to our parents , of course , he was an alcoholic ? or as the boys in those days said , he drank . " Possibly I never saw him when he was entirely sober . But he had a passion for classical literature that he could impart to even the dullest child . Meanwhile there was time in his classes to talk about many things , especially the ideal civilized human being . From him I got the first impression of the part that intelligence should play in a moral life , the first inkling that hard thought should precede any stand that one takes . He too was sometimes informal in class ; I remember how wittily and instructively he discussed relatives-in-law , for example . His mind was always discriminating , although on some days it was not very clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not even mention it to our friends , out of loyalty to this man we respected . What would a school board today  - -  think of these four : the cripple , the wanderer , the housepainter , and the alcoholic ? Could they even get jobs ? Probably not , for I doubt that they 'd had any teacher-training courses , any drilling in theories of education . If they had had , their treatment of us would have been less direct . It would have been modified by techniques for approaching the young . In their schoolroom manner was no suggestion , ever , of any formula . They were completely accessible to us as human beings . Their concern was with subjects , which they loved and therefore imparted to us with contagious enthusiasm . If we ever were discipline problems , they handled us with their human wisdom . THE TECHNICAL CURTAIN H E S E are times , today , when many rela- tionships between people are being formulated into techniques . Managers , salesmen , politicians , radio announcers , also physicians , preachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects on people . Even the Eskimos in Alaska now arc being urged to be " jollier " with the tourists . ( Otherwise tourists are disappointed , because they have heard that Eskimos are a jolly people . ) To some extent , indeed , all of us are becoming aware of the possibilities in our personal public relations . Perhaps the techniques are necessary . in a competitive culture it might be impossible to survive in sonic lines of work without a formula that breaks down resistance . And with some , such as doctors and teachers , the techniques are mostly designed for the benefit of those worked upon . But let 's recognize what all such techniques are on the human level : insincerity . An unreal situation . An approach that is not what it seems . The Eskimos are merry companions but only normally after they have known so ? eone well enough to feel safe when they are off guard with him . Any jolliness that they show to tourists will be strictly phony . Phony too , in spite of their motive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied handling of children . Excellent in intent , yet these methods can not escape being , to some extent , artificial . All deliberate methods in human relationships do sonic barns no doubt , though perhaps not too much when inforrised adults are involved . But in the case of children , must their honesty be affronted so early ? Must there be this attack upon the priceless , clear view of the young ? What they want is the blazing truth in all the adults that surround them . Anything else they can recognize as in some way false . The teacher may be convinced that a certain theoretical method will be most effective in dealing with some particular situation ; the books said it would ? and it well may be ? most effective at any one time . But the final result of too much technique may be an impression that teachers " are never people . " 1 recently talked to one of my friends , a mother of four , about what the writing class said of their teachers . She told me an incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door to her and a few days later said to her with regret , " I guess I ca n't sit on my steps any more . Three of the neighborhood children are in my class and today when I was relaxing out there in the sun , they came over and talked to me . " My friend misunderstood . She asked , " Did they bother you ? " " Oh , no , " said the teacher , " but I could n't talk to my pupils outside of school . That would be a mistake . " I think of that teacher , alone and silent behind her curtains , and I think of my teacher-traveler , holding her favorite souvenir , which was a braid of stiff black hair . She said that it came from the tail of a horse , a horse in Mongolia . " His owner said that he probably was descended from the horses of Genghis Khan when he conquered China , " she told us . " I guess he was . That horse was the w. ' ildest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her aging dark eyes . " I rode him , " she said ; and I gasped . I had been a child without very much physical courage , but from that day I had such a fervent wish to be brave that I even got myself into some situations of actual danger . In casting about for reasons why juvenile delinquency rates are rising so rapidly , critics blame parents , TV , radio , movies , comics , but seldom teachers . If teachers are dropping a curtain of technique between themselves and the children , perhaps they too should take some responsibility for the fact that many children today do not seem to be growing up , they only seem to be growing older . My writing class did not complain in so many words that anything less than a human approach to them is not fair . They do n't have enough experience yet to do that , not enough understanding . But when they composed a story , they spoke from subconscious sources , and the wish they expressed was to murder a teacher .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
