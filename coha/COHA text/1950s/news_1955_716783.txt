txt Governor Harriman 's new budget is expected to recommend a special $4,000,000 educational grant to New York City . It would be earmarked to help finance special public school classes for non-English-speaking students . The fund would be in addition to other education subsidies for the city under existing programs . The proposal was discussed today by the Governor with Dr. Paul H. Appleby , his Budget Director . It had been discussed with State Controller Arthur Levitt , a former president of the New York City Board of Education . , The Republican legislative majorities advanced , meanwhile , two bills to continue for another year the 10 per cent forgiveness of personal income taxes and the 25 per cent forgiveness of the unincorporated business tax . Both measures were approved in the Senate Finance and the Assembly Ways and Means Committees today despite Democratic protests . They will come up for final legislative action next Tuesday . Democrats on the Senate Fi // nance Committee voted against reporting the two proposals on the basis of a statement by Senator Samuel L. Greenberg of Brooklyn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charged Senator Greenberg characterized the speed shown by the Republican majority as " pure politics . " He emphasized that similar bills never had been acted upon until the new budget had been- submitted . - In the Ways and Means Cornmittee the . Deinperatic members did . not Note on the ' measures . - Senator Walter J. Mahoney , Republican leader Of the Senate , told the State Women 's Joint Legislative Forum today that- the Republicans intended to pass the bills before the budget was submitted . ? " They will be passed , " he explained , " not : to embarrass the Governor but because we think that the taxpayer is entitled to know as soon as possible what his tax rate will be and ** there is no reason now for soaking the people 10 per cent more on their income tax . " Referring to the state campaign last fall , Senator Mahoney ' recalled that Governor Harriman had " promised not to increase taxes and said any increased expenditures would be met by increased efficiencies and - economies . " " Sometimes camp &ign; promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added : " Everything that Speaker Oswald D. Heck of the Assembly and ' I have said regarding the state 's fiscal situation proves that there is no fiscal crisis in the state and there is no need to raise the income tax and it wo n't be raised . " The recommendation for a special ? grant to New York for non-English speaking students is said to be one of a few new programs that Mr.- Harriman will propose . An increase in state expenditures is in prospect to finance existing programs . The prospective cost of the Governor 's new programs has not been disclosed . Mr , Harriman has estimated that existing programs will cost $100,000,000 more next year . Republican spokesmen assert that the increase will not be more than $80,000,000 . School Subsidies to Rise How the increases for existing programs and the new programs will be financed is expected to be a major controversy between the Democratic Governor and the Republican legislative majorities . One of the biggest causes of increased state costs will be a large rise in state subsidies for schools under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in children attending public schools . Attendance is a major factor in : determining how much individual districts get . The State Education - Department estimates that it will take $347,400,000 in the new budget to continue state subsidies to local school districts on the present basis . This represents an increase of $38,900,000 . Only $a , 700,000 of the increase would go to New York City ; under the existing program . Its share of the total would be $99,100,000 next year , compared with $90 , - 400,000 this year . The city 's school population has not grown in proportion to attendance elsewhere in the state . The proposed special $4,000,000 grant to New York is less than city officials had hoped . But it is said to represent all that Governor Harriman and his advisers feel justified in view , of the condition of state finances . Presumably the Governor informed Mayor Wagner of this fact last week when they conferred in New York on city-state financial relations .                   @ @
