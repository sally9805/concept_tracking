Spirits were abroad on New Year 's Eve along the beaches around Rio de Janeiro . The five-mile crescent of Copacabana and the other Rio beaches blazed with the ritual candles of some 600,000 devotees of Brazil 's fastest-growing cult : " spiritism . " Altars were set up everywhere in the sand , heaped with fetishes and food offerings , bottles of beer and the rotgut alcohol known as cachaa . Around the altars , while drums pounded faster and faster , men , women and children danced and shouted , stomped and babbled . Yemanj , goddess of the sea , was the special object of honor ; poor families from Rio 's slums and evening-clad nightclub patrons waded into the water to toss in offerings-liquor , perfume , jewelry , and thousands of bouquets of white chrysanthemums . <P> As the pulse of the drumming quickened , the spirits drew nearer and began to possess their worshipers , who writhed and rolled in the sand : twitching and groaning . One believer pointed at another , yelling , " The evil god Exu has entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , touched it off with a candle , and watched his blazing victim run shrieking through the crowds . A young shop clerk , possessed by the spirit of the amorous Indian god Arruda , wrestled a pretty woman to the ground , died when her husband emptied his .45 into him . The next morning the beaches were littered with grisly debris-fetishes and bottles , blood , clothing , and the occasional headless carcass of a sacrificed chicken . <P> Oxala &; Ogun . The upsurge of spiritism in Roman Catholic ( 95% ) Brazil is a phenomenon of the past decade , but its roots go deep . Slaves brought their gods from Africa , and many of them changed in their new country : among the Nags , Yemanj was a river goddess who became a sea goddess on the journey across the water ; Calunga , the Bantu sea god , became the god of death during the slave ship trip to Brazil . The spirit deities also merged with Catholic theology : Oxala is both the Lord of Creation and Christ , Yemanj is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine , is also St. John the Baptist , and Ogun , the war god , is also St. George . <P> Brazilian spiritism has its European origins as well . Inspired by the lore of mediums and table-rapping in the books of Frenchman Allan Kardec , the Brazilian Spiritual Federation was founded 74 years ago , now claims 3,600 centers throughout the country . In the 1950 census some 900,000 Brazilians declared themselves spiritists , but best estimates are that about 10 million of Brazil 's 61 million population now indulge in the cults . One , the Confederaao Espirita da Umbanda , claims , in Rio alone , more than 1,000 centers , known as terreiros ( earth places ) . <P> The Roman Catholic Church , embarrassed by a shortage of priests that leaves only one for every 5,250 people , has only recently taken serious steps to combat the movement . " Our people have faith , " says Archbishop Helder Cmara of Rio . " They are instinctively religious , but they need help and spiritual guidance which they can not always get . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maximum of only 355,000 people - out of a population of 3,000,000. "
