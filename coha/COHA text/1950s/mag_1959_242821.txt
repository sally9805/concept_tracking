The battle of the 1960 Democratic presidential nomination , said the pundits at year 's beginning , would be won on the playing fields of the 86th Congress . And what green fields they were . The Democrats had swamped the Republicans in the November elections ( House 283-153 ; Senate 64-34 ) ; the Republicans were stuck with their refusal to spend their way out of the recession ; their once-popular President was held to be an ailing lame duck . Four 1960-minded Democratic Senators - Texas ' Lyndon Johnson , Missouri 's Stuart Symington , Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey , Massachusetts ' John Fitzgerald Kennedy-appeared on every score card . But by the time the 86th Congress got ready to adjourn this week for its half-time break , the four Democratic hopefuls had learned the dangers of underrating the other team . The four : <P> Texas ' Johnson , the adroit , trend-sensing Senate Majority Leader , started the session by delivering his own " State of the Union " message to fellow Democrats , pushed a liberal-spending , twelve-point program ( e.g. , " bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several items clearly beyond his legislative role and inside the executive area ( " breathe life into the newly created space agency , " " a consistent policy for Latin America " ) . He got off to a fast start on a quicker-than-the-eye maneuver to limit slightly the Senate 's filibuster Rule 22 , hoppered his own civil rights bill as a necessary prerequisite for any ambitious Texan seeking to prove that he is a Westerner , not a Southerner . <P> But in midseason , Johnson , whose chief political appeal was a habit of success , suddenly lost his rabbit 's foot . His own Preparedness Subcommittee failed to fulfill its purpose of discovering dangerous flaws in Administration defense policy . His dramatic proposal for a Congress-authorized commission to study unemployment-a tinhorn political promise thrown the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ' s conference on unemployment in Washington last April - gathered dust in a House pigeonhole as the economy boomed to new heights . His civil rights bill got nowhere . <P> So Quarterback Johnson , backed by his old coach , House Speaker Sam Rayburn , decided to play Dwight Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurl their spending bills full-sized against inevitable vetoes , thus make an irresponsible " record " for next year 's campaigns . He sought instead to shrink the proposals just enough to get under the veto , but failed in this tactic when Ike refused to compromise on the budget line . Johnson was blamed by labor for swinging key Texas Congressmen to a tough version of the labor reform bill . So by half time , Johnson had picked up a serious new handicap : many a labor leader and many a Northern Democrat have vowed to see that he gets no place on the 1960 ticket .
