Skirts Ahoy ! ( M-G-M ) , a musical about the U.S. Navy 's WAVES , might just as well have been titled Encores Aweigh . The film follows three sailorettes through boot camp , where the activities seem to consist mostly of swimming , singing and dancing in Technicolor . Esther Williams is a spoiled society girl who left her bridegroom languishing at the altar ; red-haired Joan Evans is a small-town girl who was stood up at her wedding ; blonde Vivian Elaine is a salesgirl with a Brooklyn accent . <P> On the prowl for wine , men and song , the three girls finally snag their sailors . Esther glides gracefully through several swimming numbers , and there are guest appearances by Billy Eckstine , Keenan Wynn , Bobby Van and Debbie Reynolds . But , through soggy direction of a waterlogged script , Skirts Ahoy ! comes in at only a low tide of musical entertainment . <P> The San Francisco Story ( Fidelity-Vogue ; Warner ) shows how stouthearted Joel McCrea cleaned up sinful San Francisco during the 18503 . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackmer , who is apparently responsible for most of the corruption in California . Blackmer 's good friend , sultry Yvonne de Carlo , horsewhips McCrea and then tries to have him shanghaied , but deep down she really loves him . In the end , McCrea , assisted by Yvonne , bests Blackmer in a shotgun duel on horseback and sets the stage for law &; order in San Francisco . A horse opera that tries determinedly to be rugged , The San Francisco Story merely succeeds in being ragged .
