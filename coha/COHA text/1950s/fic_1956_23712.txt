THE TAMPERER A Story by Thomas C. Turner Drawings by Stanley Wyatt T HERE is about good freshmen an aura of ignorant hopeful expectation which invites hazing or swindling or teaching  --  in every case some kind of tampering with innocence . This must have been very true of me the warm October night Acton Denbigh came to my dormitory room . A clink was on the back of my head , a textbook lay open in my lap , and my door stood slightly ajar . After a tap on the door a portly man with a mist of thin golden hair over his large head came into the room . He carried a silver-headed cane , and he walked with an erect stroll , which suggested a delicious feeling of ease in the bowels . This stroll as much as his mastery of the stinging random remark I learned later Ieft a wake of clenched teeth wherever he went . I got to my feet , for obviously he was not an undergraduate  --  more likely a member of the faculty . He advanced toward me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Darrow ? " " Yes , sir . " " I am Acton Denbigh , your cousin . You were in the cradle the last time we met . " We shook hands . I had heard a lot about Acton . He hadattended a record number of universities , including Oxford , and he was in graduate college here at Princeton now . His presence inspired some awe in me . The door opened , and a stranger entered and pitched himself on my sofa without speaking or even glancing- at me . He had a Tong nose , small furtive eyes , and the upward slant of his hair reminded me of the crest of a flycatcher . He looked to be an undergraduate . Acton pointed at the newcomer with his cane . " That is Milney , " he said . We did not shake hands . Acton seemed to be naming the species of the newcomer rather than introducing him . " Darrow , " said my cousin , pacing about the room , " I can give you some advice . Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his keen eye made me conscious of how carelessly I had selected these second-hand furnishings . " First about clothes , " said Acton . " That shirt you 're wearing . Do n't wear dark-colored shirts or anything that is called a ' sport ' shirt . " He threw open my closet door . " Get yourself three dark suits . " He poked about the closet with his canc . " Get rid of these two double-breasted suits . " He fingered my neckties distastefully . " Wear only stripes , small patterns , and single colors . " The array of toilet articles on my battered chest of drawers caught his attention , and he tapped one bottle with his index finger . One miscellaneous point : do n't use any hairdressing or after-shave preparation with an odor . " When asked what you want to drink before dinner , say a dry martini . If they ' have n't that , take what they have . After dinner ask for Scotch and water . Do n't he afraid to mix beverages . That 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You will , " said Acton . " Do n't go to chapel . Identify yourself with some local church . Meet the minister . As for the extracurricular field , engage in one activity , preferably some kind of athletics . Do n't publish any poetry and do n't agitate for anything . Oh , yes , you will see other undergraduates wearing dirty white buckskin shoes . Avoid them . Any questions ? " " Yes , " I said . " I was wondering about some good courses . What would you say ? " " Learn French and German . Take the best courses in each department  --  Buzzer 's history , Alyea 's chemistry , Root 's English . Avoid the trade sciences . " He gestured with his cane in the direction of the science buildings . " They will take up your afternoons with laboratories . " He wok a visiting card from his pocket and wrote on it with a fountain pen . " Here is my address . I 'll be glad to have you drop in , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry now . " He strolled to the door and paused there . " One more thing . There is a lesson to be learned in college  --  the lesson of laissez faire . Not in economics where it 's been dead for many decades , but laissez faire in personal dealings . It is not always easy to learn ; at prep school I 'm sure you were taught the opposite . Misfits must be hounded , eccentricities punished , the unathletic confounded . Everyone in college should learn , if anything , to be tolerant and not to interfere . " Milney , who had been quietly yo-yoing on the sofa , got up and walked between us to the open closet door , then crowded after Acton . I was alarmed to see that he had two of my suits slung over his arm . " Hey , wait , " I said with a nervous laugh . " Acton , your friend is taking my clothes . " Acton turned and said sharply : " Suppose you explain yourself , Milney . " Milney looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits ? " His voice trailed away . " Yost thought what I said made these clothes your own ? " Acton said cruelly . " I do n't know . I heard you say that , and I saw them , and I do n't know what happened . I guess I swooned . " Sensing that this word did nothing to heighten the plausibility of his explanation , .11ilney added : " 1 blacked out . " " Very lame , " said Acton . " Now put those suits back this instant . " " I 'm too young to die ! " screamed Milney , writhing and struggling against imaginary captors . " I did n't do it ! I 'm innocent ! I been framed ? " Acton silenced Milney with a light whack of his cane . " And I told you to leave that yo-yo in your pocket . " Acton looked at me with a pained smile and departed . . Milney dumped my suits in a chair and followed him . I gathered up my suits and hung them in the closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's presumptuous advice . On the contrary I was grateful , though some of the things he said , when I turned them over in my mind , were not clearto me . What he meant about white bucks , for example . Did he mean to avoid white bucks or the people who wore them ? I would have to ask him . Actually I did not reject any of Acton 's advice , but somehow I never got around to taking any of it . Freshmen often do that . Perhaps they are not so vulnerable as they look . Some of Acton 's advice was not really practical : I was never able to find any odorless hairdressing or shaving lotion . Also there was a certain amount of paradox in his advice to avoid the sciences and to take Alyea 's chemistry . But the most confusing aspect of Acton 's visit was Milney. just could n't understand why he tolerated Milney . T H E next week on a lonely Sunday afternoon I visited Acton 's apartment on Nassau Street . The heavy curtains held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor , tobacco , exotic soaps , and a strain which I associated with new clothes or books . There were eight people in the room . Acton was in the center , lolling like a manatee in a bog of an oversized sofa . Without stirring he introduced me to the others , and they hastily shook hands with me. 1 realized that I had interrupted something . " Here he comes , " said someone at the window . " I 'll bet even Milney wo n't drink that , " said a lanky blond boy named John Gordon . " I 'm sure he will , " said Acton , holding up a glass of amber liquid , in which I could see a piece of ice and a strange brown curd . " He never refuses free whiskey . " They explained the joke to me . This was a drink they had just invented called the 1Vhiskey Sweet , made of equal parts of bourbon and of black-strap molasses . Milney burst into the room and immediately accepted the glass which Acton held out to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass warily , realizing that we were all watching him . " How was it , Milney ? " said Acton . Milney licked his lips and looked into the glass . " It tastes very milbon , " he said , offering his glass for a refill . " What did he say ? " I asked . Milney seemed unaware that the word was out of the ordinary . " Milbon , " he repeated . " That 's characteristic , " said Acton . He coins words quite unconsciously , and that one is obviously a corruption of his own name  --  his way of saying that he liked that nauseating drink . No , you ca n't have another , Milney . You 've already made an ass of yourself by enjoying that one . " Acton sank back into his nest of pillows with a sigh . " He has some words which are much purer than that  --  some which have no comprehensible derivation . " I had come at a good time to learn how Acton ran his establishment . His friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that Acton always had the floor . This was his dominion , and no one interrupted him . Because I was Acton 's cousin , they accepted me , but freshmen were not generally welcomed . The group had a spirit which is difficult to describe . In effect it meant that nothing in the interest of perpetrating a joke was too expensive or troublesome , and I quickly gained a feeling of comradeship toward everyone I met there . Another undergraduate whom I met that afternoon , John Gordon , became my closest friend . The apartment itself filled me with envy , for it was beautifully furnished anti contained a large collection of phonograph records , more than two dozen pieces of fine cut glass carefully locked away behind glass doors , and many expensive hooks  --  some antique , others full of reproductions of paintings , a few in languages like Dutch which Acton could not read . Acton 's remarks that Sunday afternoon set off a great deal of interest in Milney 's speech . Milney found that for the first time in his life people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as he opened his mouth . Some of the remarks which attracted attention were merely mistake 's , like his claiming that his favorite author was W. Somerset Mormon . Acton dismissed this as a lie , for he had seen-Milney 's library , which except for textbooks consisted of only two volumes  --  G. A. Henty 's By Sheer Pluckand some mimeographed pornography called the Diary of a French Type Secretary . Some of Milney 's words like the word " beach " remained obscure in meaning . Others were clear enough . I once saw Nlilney reach down and pick at what appeared to be egg on his shirt . " Kuncktum , " he said , wiping at it ineffectually . This was apparently a generic term for anything he spilled on himself . Acton had touched off this new interest in Milney , and he was soon to regret it . Not two weeks later I. went to Acton 's and found him there alone , looking as though he were going to cry . He peered at me from his sofa and said anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then seeing that I was alone , he settled back , his lips thrust out in disappointment . " Where is everyone ? " 1 asked . " I 'll tell you where they arc , " he said angrily . " Milney 's holding court in his room , and they 're all there . If it were only a crowd of freshmen , I would n't mind . But everyone 's there  --  Ordway , both the Carrington brothers . Even John Gordon spends more time there than here . You go too , " he added bitterly . " Blood is not much thicker than water . " " But I do n't want to . Milney 's a terrible bore . And I Ca n't understand why they go . " " I 'll tell you wily . It 's that word-coining . They sit around , and every time Milney says anything , they scream with laughter . " He clenched his teeth . " I would n't go there if my life depended on it ! " A CT 0 N in a sense had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an error of the admissions office , the kind of error which i5 usually rectified by dismissal at the end of its first semester . Milney , saved by Acton 's tutoring before examinations each semester , was now in his second college year . Why Acton persevered it took me some time to find out , for while Milney was one of the most ignorant people I have ever known , Acton was probably the laziest . Acton 's method was to send Milney to the library for files of previous examinations , figure out likely questions , and dictate their answers . Milney wrote down and memorized these answers and passed enough examinations to stay in college . I studied some of Acton 's productions myself , and they were marvelously worked out . Yet Milney was in a whiny mood early in December when the time came again to select his courses for the next semester . I hail heard that lie was in trouble in most of his current subjects , and that was why he was at Acton 's instead of performing for the all-too-responsive audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach on the floor of Acton 's apartment , staring at the prospectus . " I want some real gut courses , " he whined . " How about astrology ? " I suggested . " I 've had that , " said Milney . " How about Roman numerals ? I hear there 's nothing to that . " " He 's had all the really easy courses , " said Acton . " Even I ca n't get him through a difficult course . He 's come to the end of his tether . " Acton looked moodily over the prospectus . " All the easy courses except one . " Acton began to pace restlessly about the apartment . " Milney , how would you like a course so simple that you could pass with no more effort than it takes an apple tree to grow apples . A new course worked out too late for the prospectus . It seems there has been a feud between the linguistics and philosophy departments , and this course of study is a gesture to make peace between them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student to coin words . " Milney was looking at Acton blankly . " You do that anyway , Milney , " I pointed out . " They expect the preceptorials to be chaotic , " said Acton dreamily . " Everyone shouting new words and who 's to say who 's talking nonsense ? Of course the lectures will contain a lot of linguistics and philosophy , but the exam 's incredibly simple . They say it will have one question : Write our two absolutely new words . " Milney had gotten to his feet . " 1 do that anyway , do n't I ? " he said excitedly . " Indeed you do , " said Acton . " How do you spell that ? " said Milney . Acton spelled out the word " neologisms " slowly and at the same time poured some brandy into the bottom of an enormous snifter . " I 've hoped that they 'd let me teach it . My first course . But I 'm afraid they 'll give it to someone else , someone who is less partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clutching his prospectus and course card , he ran wildly out the door . I leaned close to a window through the sash of which leaked trickles of cold December air . On the street below I could see Milney hurrying along with his distinctive loping walk . " He 's headed for Nassau Hall , " I told Acton . " Are n't you afraid he 's going to make trouble ? " " I 'm bloody sure he 's going to make trouble . " " I mean for you . " I was watching Milney 's receding shape in the twilight . " Do n't you sec how far out of line this coining of Milney 's has got ? Do n't you realize that the situation is critical and calls for surgery ? " " Well , you started it . " " Yes , " said Acton quietly , " and I 'm going to finish it . " He moved to the phonograph . " Now let 's have silence for Boyd Neel 's splendid recording of Handers first concerto grosso . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning but stopped by Acton 's apartment around noon for a report on Neologisms 101 . John Gordon had seen Milney about an hour before , and this was apparently what had happened . Milney had gone to his adviser to get his course card approved . The adviser had called the dean 's office to make sure Neologisms 101 would be given . The dean and his assistants said they knew nothing about the course but conceded that there might he one . They did a lot of telephoning to try to find someone who knew something about it . That was the last I heard about the course until Acton 's telephone rang late that afternoon . Acton turned the phonograph down and answered the telephone . After a few monosyllables he hung up and turned to me . " They 've traced it to us . We 're wanted at the dean 's office right now . " We walked toward Nassau Hall in silence . It was a gray misty day . I was resentful and a little frightened , feeling that I had been unfairly dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech to exonerate myself before the dean . " What do you think he 'll do ? " I asked Acton . " I do n't know . Keep us standing for a while , I 'm afraid . " We found this note tacked on the dean 's door : " There will he no course in neologisms given next semester . " Inside stood the dean , a tall neat man who looked at us coldly and curiously through gleaming rimless glasses . Beside him stood Milney and two other undergraduates whom I did not know . " Mr. Denbigh , " said the dean wearily , " these boys find it hard to believe that no course in neologisms will be given at this university . I want them to hear the truth from your own lips . " Acton turned to Milney and the two other diehards and said gravely : " Well , I 'm afraid there wo n't be one next semester although God knows I 've done what I could . " The dean looked at Acton for a long time . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Acton said , yes , that was correct , and the dean shook his head and sighed . I felt that the dean should not have said that about Acton 's being a graduate student , thereby implying he was too old for this kind of horsing around . I could tell Acton did n't like it because for one thing he had nothing to say . " All right , " said the dean , sitting down . Acton and I went out , with the neologists trooping out behind . Actors was moody all the rest of that day and well into the next , and his mood dampened my spirits . Gordon and I sat in his apartment , filling out our course cards , talking in low voices . Acton lay back , sipping a glass of wine , his large form glittering in his golden dressing gown . " A great year , " he said , staring into his wine glass . " Do n't play the phonograph , please , Darrow . It does n't suit meh . " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in and got himself a can of beer from the refrigerator . Except for the little noises he made drinking , the wont was quiet . Acton regarded Milney speculatively . " Milney , they 're going to give that course in neologisms after all , " he said . John and I looked at each other in surprise , This was riding a joke a little hard , even for Acton . " Yes , " said Acton , " and it looks as though after the trouble with the dean yesterday  --  you saw the way he washed his hands of it  --  it 's my baby . Are you still interested ? " Milney nodded vigorously . " Well , just enter it on your course card and meet me over in McCosh lounge for tryouts at seven-thirty tonight . Yes , just mark through one of those courses and write in Neologisms 101 . " When Milney went back to the kitchen for another can of beer , I whispered to Acton : " The dean is really going to be burned up . Better stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want both of you to be there , " said Acton , forking two fingers to include me and Gordon . " And do n't act silly or you 'll give it away . " J O H N and I were there at seven-thirty , and so was a graduate student loiterer named Ordway who smoked a short pipe . Milney was already there , sprawled in a leather arm chair . A Chinese boy came in with an armload of books , asked politely if this were neologisms preceptorial , and being told that it was , sat down . Acton came then , out of breath , jolly , and apologetic about being late . He sat down , toldus we could smoke if we liked , saw to it that we all had ash trays , then plunged into a five-minute history of neologisms from the earliest times . He explained that this course would not take up new uses for old words , a meaning for the word neologism allowed by some dictionaries . Only brand-new words would be accepted . " 1 ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said informally . " Let 's have a go at it . " His accent became more brittle and precise than ever . " Try this one . ' Imitation of natural motions . ' That 's basic enough . " My mind was a hazy jumble about the origin of the dance from an encyclopedia article , and the word " dance " would not budge from my mind . " Vocculation , " said Ordway . " Too latiiiate , " said Acton . " Too hybrid a sound . " " Skink , " said the Chinese boy , making a swerving motion with his hands . " Skink is a good English word , " said Acton . " It 's a lizard . " He looked at me encouragingly . " Mr. Darrow , we have n't heard from you this evening . " " Would you repeat the question ? " " I prefer not to think of it as a question . Imitation of natural motions . Call it , the nonverbal counterpart of onomatopoeia . " " Danceburger , " I said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the others . " Mr. Gordon ? Mr. Marley ? " " Plimmon , " said Milney . " Plimmon is correct , " Acton ruled promptly . My efforts for the next half hour were too embarrassing to recall , and Gordon did no better . Every word the Chinese boy suggested , once he spelled it , turned out to be an English word . Ordway was too educated for Neologisms 101 ; his words all sounded like Greek or Latin to Acton . Milney 's words were all ruled best . it was true that he was enough of an ignoramus to have his mind completely free . It annoyed me for him to shout someone else down with a word of his own and for Acton to pronounce that word excellent . When the preceptorial broke up , Milney walked back to my room with me . For once he was in a position . to lord , it over me , and I suppose he displayed . remarkable restraint . He would reminisce about how he had been stumped at some point during the preceptorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up to my room to discuss it further , but I would n't let him , saying I had to study . His parting words were : " It was really a rocket , was n't it ? " " Yes , I guess so , " I responded coldly . M ILNEY 'S manner had changed com- pletely when I ran into him on the worn brick steps of Nassau Hall the next afternoon . " Too much of a rucket for you guys , was n't it ? " he said angrily . " What do you mean , Milney ? " He held up a very messy course card , on which Neologisms 101 had been marked through and Geology 104 written in its place . " Acton says the dean wo n't let him give the course , " said Milney , " because you guys dropped out . " I was relieved to hear him say that . Evidently Gordon and Ordway had persuaded Acton to call Milney off . Milney was at Acton 's when I went there a few minutes later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors , and once again Acton had the floor . He was glowing , gesturing , walking about triumphantly as he talked . He interrupted himself to tell me as I entered : " Milney is very much disappointed in you . " " We would 've had a good gut if you guys had n't rocketed out , " said Milney . He used his word self-consciousiy ; . scanning our faces , waiting expectantly for applause . Acton looked at me with a smile . " Yes , he 's spoiled it , has n't he ? I think I see some disapprobation in your eye , Cousin . " He continued to look at me , but he was clearly talking for the others . " Milney means something to me , and perhaps I ought to explain exactly what . When I first met Milney , I thought , ' Here is a completely unprepossessing young man , but doubtless he 'll turn out to have redeeming qualities and be another uninteresting mediocre shard of humanity . ' But he did n't . " Acton formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no redeeming qualities at all . He was loud , vulgar , unscrupulous , adolescent . Then he started coining these words , and I admit it had a certain charm . But now he 's spoiled it . I knew he could n't stand the victory of last night . His asshood is consummated once more . Do you see ? It rather tidied the thing up . " It was the pleased smile on Acton 's plump pink face that exasperated me enough to protest . " You remember what you said that first night about laissez faire ? Do n't you think Milney as a human being is entitled to a little of it ? " I could see surprise on every face but Milney 's . They turned to Acton to see what he would do to me . I felt very uncomfortable in the ensuing silence . Acton thoughtfully caressed the stem of his brandy inhaler . " No , not entitled to it , butI see what you mean  --  on principle . That 's an interesting idea . Go on . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my gaze was arrested by the sight of Milney . " Milney , " I said . ' ' Speak up . Do n't let him treat you this way ? " But Milney had not been listening . He sat on a chair arm and gazed out at the twilight . What were his thoughts at that moment ? I despaired of ever finding out . I had never wanted to be innocent , and seeing Milney sitting there , I felt that I had been losing my innocence for years . But Milney 's innocence had not even been touched although what Acton had done should have turned him into a bitter has-been . " Milney 's not such a had fellow to have around , " I said , and I think they understood .
