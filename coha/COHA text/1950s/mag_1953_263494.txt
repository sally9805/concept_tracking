Many scientists think that life appeared on earth when the atmosphere , instead of being its present mixture of oxygen , nitrogen and carbon dioxide , contained methena , ammonia and hydrogen . These ingredients , still to be found in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn , slowly combined into larger and larger organic ( carbon-containing ) molecules , according to the hypothesis . At last one molecule , a complex protein , showed the ability to absorb other molecules and create replicas of itself out of their material . This " Adam molecule " was the first life ; it could grow and reproduce itself . <P> When Nobel Prizewinner Harold Urey Jaborated on this theory last year ( TIME , Mov. 24 ) , he said that one of his students <P> s checking it experimentally . Last week 's Science carried the promised report . Graduate Student Stanley L. Miller , 23 , told how he had simulated conditions on a primitive earth and created out of its atmospheric gases several organic compounds that are close to proteins . <P> Miller set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the water was heated , its vapor circulated the other gases past a small electric " corona " discharge , which promoted chemical reactions among their molecules . This sort of thing may have happened on the primitive earth , where lightning was probably common . In any case , the influence of the electric discharge was similar to that of the strong , solar radiation beating down on the top of the primitive atmosphere . <P> When the apparatus had run for a day , the water grew pinkish , then turned red . After a week . Student Miller analyzed the mixture . It proved to contain at least three amino acids ( glycine , alpha-alanine and beta-alanine ) . This was the hoped-for payoff : amino acids are the building blocks of which proteins are made . <P> Professor Urey and Student Miller do not believe that they have created life . What they have done is to prove that complex organic compounds found in living matter can be formed , by chemical reactions , out of the gases that were probably common in the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big as the ocean , and if it had worked for a million years instead of one week , it might have created something like the first living molecule .
