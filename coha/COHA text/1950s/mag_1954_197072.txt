On Sunday , Aug. 24 , 1873 , pioneer Western Photographer William H. Jackson and his helpers clambered up the iced boulders of Colorado 's wild Sawatch mountains with a bulky camera , primitive film , darkroom tent and developing chemicals to make the first photograph of a natural wonder : the Mountain of the Holy Cross . Jackson made thousands of other pictures , but Holy Cross was considered his masterpiece . Despite technical progress , the thousands of Holy Cross photographs made since never surpassed Jackson 's famous picture . And none , it turned out last week , ever will . <P> Legend has it that two 18th century Spanish monks first found and named the 14,000-ft. mountain with the cross , formed by two great snow-packed crevices . After Jackson 's picture made the mountain celebrated , pilgrims and plain tourists came by the thousands . Eventually , just 25 years ago , President Herbert Hoover proclaimed the mountain a national monument . With due ceremony , Colorado last week began to celebrate the monument 's 25th anniversary . <P> Governor Dan Thornton put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for " a pilgrimage in spirit to the Mount of the Holy Cross . " On the City Hall carillon , Faith of Our Fathers and other suitable anthems were played . The Rocky Mountain News wrote : " The hand of the Creator wrinkled the brow of this majestic peak in a symmetrical cruciform that cradles the ice and snow of ages . . . " An apologetic mountaineer heard the bells , read the paper , and called the News to say that something had been overlooked . The left arm cross has been crumbling away from slides and erosion . Four years ago , when the cross was no longer apparent , the National Parks Service recommended to President Truman that the mountain be taken off the list of national monuments . He acted accordingly . <P> The bells had scarcely stopped ringing last week when Colorado quietly called off the rest of the 25th anniversary ceremonies .
