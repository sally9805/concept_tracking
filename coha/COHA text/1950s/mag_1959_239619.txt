Exercise is a good thing , physicians from a variety of specialties agreed last week at a Sports Medicine Congress held in Chicago in connection with the Third Pan-American Games . But how much exercise is best ? What kind ? At what time of life ? To these key questions there were no sharp answers , because medical science knows surprisingly little about the specific effects of different types of exercise on the human heart . As the experts puffed toward the finish line , they reached a consensus on some preliminary findings . Athlete 's heart " is an unfortunate term that should be discarded , because it indicates a diseased state that does not exist , said New York University 's Dr. Louis F. Bishop .

Wolffe of Valley Forge Hospital said that the muscles in a normal person 's limbs will give out , leaving him unable to move , before he can strain the more powerful heart muscle . Some of the rare cases of collapse and sudden death during exercise may be due to exhaustion of blood sugar rather than heart damage . Exercise helps to guard against obvious obesity ( a proved life-shortener ) , said Boston 's bicycle-riding Paul Dudley White , 73 , himself as lean as a beanpole , and also against harmful fat deposits that hide in arteries supplying the legs , lungs , heart and brain . <P> To do the most good , even moderate exercise should be continuous throughout life . Said Dr. Bishop : " About 25 , many young adults become too busy for exercise ; yet in the next two decades of their lives they probably need it even more than children . ' '
