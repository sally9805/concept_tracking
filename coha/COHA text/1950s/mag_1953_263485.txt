In his cell in Prague 's grim Pankrac prison one day last week , one of the world 's most celebrated political prisoners got unexpected visitors . Two U.S. Embassy officials called on Associated Press Correspondent William Oatis , 39 , who had been in prison two years on a spying charge . They left two oddly matched articles-a pair of Argyle socks knitted by his wife , and his passport . The Embassy was acting on the suspicion that Oatis might need both for traveling . Fourteen hours later he did . Oatis was taken before a Czech Communist official and told that he had been freed . He was no more astounded than everyone else . The U.S. had apparently been making little progress in negotiations for his release , and only two weeks ago the Czechs announced that a new amnesty order for Czech prisoners did not apply to Oatis . <P> From Pankrac , Oatis was taken to the U.S. Embassy in Prague , and after breakfast with Ambassador George Wadsworth , was driven to the U.S. zone of Germany . To newsmen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , seemed bewildered . On his face was the look of utter confusion that imprisoned men often wear when first confronted with the outside world again . Newsman Oatis had been cut off so completely that he did not know Eisenhower was President , that Stalin was dead , that he himself had become a symbol for the free press of the West . When one reporter greeted him with the words , " You 're famous now , Bill , " Oatis only replied in a puzzled voice , " I do n't see why . " <P> The Letter . Why had he been released ? The Czechs , said Oatis , told him that " a letter my wife wrote to the President of Czechoslovakia had a great deal to do with it . " From St. Paul , where she is an ad copywriter in a department store , Laurabelle Oatis had indeed written a pleading letter to the late President Gottwald seven months ago : " At the time he left for Czechoslovakia we had only been married three months . . . We married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days go by ... Surely there must be some way in which you . . . can commute his sentence to expulsion from Czechoslovakia . I appeal to you with all my heart for mercy . " But no one seriously believed that the letter had been anything more than a convenient excuse for the Communists to free Oatis , probably as part of their " peace offensive . " <P> In an Army hotel in Nrnberg , Oatis , nervously chewing gum and chain-smoking , appeared before 100 newsmen for his first press conference . Asked about everything from his imprisonment and trial to his confession and treatment by the Reds , he seemed to find it hard to tell what he had undergone . Said he : " It would be very difficult for me to describe what happened so that I could be understood by anyone not familiar with such proceedings , or with what is done , individually ... If what I was heard to say or was reported to have said during the trial sounded like I was reciting something , why , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistreated or terrorized ? <P> " No , I was not , " said Oatis . " The treatment varied from time to time , but in general it was good . "
