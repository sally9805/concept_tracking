The U.S. was the last of the great Western nations to possess a national gallery of art . Yet now , less than 14 years after its dedication , the National Gallery in Washington ranks with the world 's finest . The gallery 's principal offering is a grand tour of Western art-from stiff but splendid beginnings in Siena and Florence right through to the skyrocket flash and fizzle of modern times . Casual visitors may make the tour in a day , students in a decade ; the gallery is solidly studded with masterpieces . <P> Fat Cushions &; Big Lights . Washington cab drivers are likely to refer to the museum as " the Mellon gallery , " which is just what its founder , Financier Andrew Mellon , hoped to avoid . He wanted to build no personal monument but a palace for Everyman , which would be a lasting glory to the nation . The neoclassic building cost Mellon $15 million , is as palatial as any structure to be found in the Western Hemisphere . Its central dome was modeled on the Pantheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed of over 40 kinds and shades of marble , from " Istrian Nuage " ( Italy ) to " Vermont Radio Black , " and enclose five acres of exhibition space . There are fat-cushioned couches for the foot-weary , and fountain courts ringed with fishtail palms to soothe the eye-weary . Behind the scenes is an air-conditioning system that gulps 5,000 gallons of water a minute . Some 600 lamps , like those used for night baseball , glow softly through the diffusion-glass ceiling . <P> In turning his own collection over to the gallery , Mellon urged that it be used as a criterion for further acquisitions in order " to prevent the introduction ... of inferior works of art . " To assure a continuing high standard , he set up a self-perpetuating board of trustees which examines all gift horses with a dentist 's doubtful eye . Since Mellon 's death in 1937 , vast bequests from Samuel Kress and Joseph Widener ( old masters ) , Lessing Rosenwald ( prints and drawings ) and Chester Dale ( old masters and modern French paintings ) have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,696 sculptures ( mostly small ) , 21,451 prints and drawings , 22,000 watercolor renderings and photographs of American art objects ( made under WPA auspices ) , 815 objects of decorative art , and 1,436 photographs from Alfred Stieglitz ' collection . Total worth : more than $200 million . <P> Happily for future donors , almost a third of the gallery remains to be filled . Director David Finley is in no hurry to fill it . " We would like to be not one of the largest galleries , " he explains , " but one of the best . " The truth is that European masterpieces in private hands grow fewer every year , while laws prohibiting their export from most European countries make them ever harder to obtain .
