Most accounts of Nixon 's career in the Senate adopt an apologetic tone , as if it were hardly fair to count this interval against him . It is customary to brush lightly over the fact that he served only 19 months , that fresh ? man Senators are more often seen than heard , that as a congenital lone wolf he failed to achieve any real per ? sonal standing in the " most exclusive club in the world . " But in the opinion of so informed an observer as Wil ? liam S. White , Nixon 's record in the Senate " was even more lacking in distinction " than in the House . The dramatic highlight of the 1951 session of Con ? congress was the MacArthur incident ? Truman 's peremp ? tory order April 11 removing the General as Supreme Commander in the Far East and the Senate hearings that followed in May . For Nixon , the MacArthur affair was a windfall that smacked of pure providence . He had campaigned against the Truman-Acheson Far Eastern policies , and on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rejection of appeals for unity . " The fact that the policies of our State Department over the past five years have resulted in failure , at least in the Far East , makes it imperative , " Nixon said , " that we develop a new policy which will have a better chance to succeed . . . Unity on a policy which was wrong could bring even greater disaster . What we must have is unity on a policy which represents the best thinking of all our people . " To spell out such a policy , he called for military strength , a strong economy including price controls , ra ? tioning and wage controls , and finally a policy of foreign alliances . In succeeding weeks he lost no opportunity to label the Administration 's foreign policy a failure and to criticize the conduct of the war in Korea . At the end of January , at the Women 's National Republican Club in New York , he took an even bolder line , calling upon the United Nations to " get into Korea " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said our men were being asked to " fight a battle with their hands , in effect tied behind their backs . " " In other words , " he declared , " the time has come when either the UN should recognize the obvious fact of Chinese Communist aggression and take effective action to meet it , or the US should withdraw its troops from Korea . Certainly we can not ask our men to give their lives unless we back them to the hilt . . . . " From the beginning , Nixon was one of those who failed to grasp the concept of a limited war as a com ? bined politico-military struggle . He took the familiar view that a war to be successful must end in the destruc ? tion of the enemy , or of his will to fight , and in the physical occupation of his territory . When that enemy was nominally a tiny patch of soil like North Korea , Nixon and kindred formalists , whose adjustments to the strategic implications of Commu ? nism had to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had not per ? ceived , or were not yet prepared to admit , that North Korea was not at all what it seemed , was not an inde ? pendent sovereignty but rather the spearpoint of the Communist empire , and it was therefore unconquerable so long as the will to fight existed in the rest of the Communist empire . Hence , whether the United States was " backing to the hilt " its fighting men in Korea depended on what was expected of the war . Victory in the narrow military sense could be achieved only by an all-out struggle with the Soviet Union ? in other words , the dread holocaust of a third world war . Victory in the larger political sense might and , as events proved , did consist of preventing the extinction of the Republic of Korea . The logic of this analysis had failed Nixon and a good share of the American public in the early months of 1951 . MacArthur 's dismissal thus came as an unparal ? leled outrage to millions who had been led to accept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instinc ? tive traditionalist found himself in their company . But , however faulty the Senator 's premises may have been in the light of history , he nevertheless judged aright DECEMBER 14 , 1959 in the immediate political context . Within hours after the announcement , he had taken up the cudgels in the General 's defense . " The happiest group in the country , " he said in a statement , " will be the Communists and their stooges . The President has given them what they have al ? ways wanted ? MacArthur 's scalp . " His next ploy , harking back to his success with it in the recent campaign against Helen Douglas , was to link the British with Communism . " The President has lined up with Dean Acheson and the British bloc of appeasers in the United Nations , " he said angrily . " . . The only possible explanation of the President 's action is that he felt it was necessary to get rid of MacArthur so that Acheson would be free to make a deal with the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacArthur , he said , " was fired simply because he had the good sense and patriotism to ask that the hands of our fighting men in Korea be untied . " He pleaded for the avoidance of " tragic appeasement " and promised that the " policies of MacArthur will bring victory and peace in the Pacific . . . " On the same day he drafted and introduced Senate Resolution 126 in which he would have had his col ? leagues declare it to be the sense of the Senate " that the President of the United States has not acted in the best interests of the American people in relieving of his com ? mands and depriving the United States of the services of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur and that the President should reconsider his action and should restore General MacArthur to the commands from which he was removed . " To climax that busy April 11 Nixon took the floor in the Senate to engage in a long colloquy setting forth his defense of MacArthur and his indictment of the Admin ? istration 's Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he deplored " emotional and personal considerations " and suggested " it would be wise for members of the Senate to consider objectively and fac ? tually what our differences are . " Prescription for Victory What followed was his usual skillful polemic ; Mac ? Arthur was paraded across the stage from time to time as a martyred symbol , but the spotlight focused hard and continuously on those in power , on " those who have failed so miserably . " " Let me say that I am not among those who believe that General MacArthur is infallible , " he assured the Senate . " I am not among those who think that he has not made decisions which are subject to criticism . But I do say that in this particular instance he offers an alternative policy which the American people can and will support . He offers a change from the policies which have led us almost to the brink of disaster in Asia . . . . " THE NEW REPUBLIC ventured one more intrusion into the MacArthur affair . On April 26 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led down a dignified blind alley , Nixon introduced a bill which , he explained to the Senate , would make it a " violation of law for any officer of the federal government to dismiss or otherwise discipline a government employee for testify ? ing before a committee of Congress . " With the MacArthur hearings about to open , he said , it was " essential to the security of the nation " that every witness " have complete freedom from reprisal . Unless protection is given to witnesses who are members of the armed services or employees of the government , the scheduled hearings will amount to no more than a parade of yes-men for Administration policies . " The Emerging Strategy In the MacArthur hearings that followed between May 3 and June 25 , Nixon 's bill served no practical pur ? pose , but it fitted neatly into the evolving Republican political pattern . It was part of the over-all strategy of guilt-by-association and indictment-by-innuendo to suggest the existence of dire skeletons in the Truman closet , the existence of conspiratorial forces and secret plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good tactics to hint in advance of the hearings that powerful pressures would be used to cover up , and it was part of the masquerade to let voters know that the loyal opposition was on its toes , fighting the fight . Nixon was on his feet in the Senate again April 27 , pleading the cause of the Chinese Nationalists on For ? mosa , and ridiculing the Administration 's policy of fighting a land war " instead of using to the fullest extent our naval power and our air power . . . . We are using our airplanes only for the purpose of tactical bombing , " he said accusingly , disregarding the fact that we had no jet bombers capable of raiding China , and no long-range jet fighters capable of escorting our obsolete B-29 's . " We are not using our Navy for the purpose of a blockade . . . . We are unable to win a military victory in Korea . We are unable to do so because we are restricted in the use of both strategic bombing and naval power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his relentless strategy of opposition , rose to his feet to echo Nixon and to spur him on . " The Senator states the case very clearly , " he said in his flat , passionless monotone . " I agree with the Senator . It was a mistake originally to go into Korea . . . . That 's correct . That is my view . " It was a question whether the Junior Senator from California , the youngest member on the Republican side , was his own spokesman or Taft 's puppet . Certain ? ly at no time during the Korean War did any responsible military staff on the United Nations side endorse the Nixon-Taft-MacArthur thesis . Those charged with the grave responsibility of making decisions disagreed cat gorically with Nixon 's assertion on May 1 : " I believe th only way we can end this war is not by a go-day-lon ' peace talk ' but by military victories and economi blockades to shut out all foreign trade and smugglin such as now continues to aid Red China . There can b no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment was wrong , of course , as the Eisen hower Administration was eventually to demonstrate , not only in Korea but in Indo-China as well , but this did not prevent him from using the discredited MacArthur thesis as a club with which to beat the Democrats in his ' 51- ' 52 appearances at GOP rallies . - As early as May 12 , he was assuring an audience of lawyers in Akron , without a shred of evidence , that MacArthur had won a personal victory in the great de ? bate over Far Eastern policy . He listed what he called six " basic changes " in policy for which he contended Mac .. Arthur was responsible , culminating with the assertion that the Administration had been " forced to agree " that the only way to end the Korean War was with victory on the battlefield . Nixon 's role in the MacArthur incident stands out with special clarity in any evaluation of his career . In it he took a categorical stand from the first moment . He carried the fight aggressively , both on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of months . For political rea ? sons , he committed himself impulsively to a military doctrine that lay outside the bounds of his training and experience . He staked his judgment , not on facts , but on a series of hypotheses , and he ignored facts that could have saved him . History will make the final assess ? ment , but so deeply has his thesis been eroded in the interval that his basic capacity to judge and govern must seem to have been grievously impaired . Influence Peddling The MacArthur controversy had scarcely subsided when it was succeeded by a new sensation . On the ini ? tiative of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , it was revealed that the Chairman of the Democratic National Commit ? tee , William M. Boyle , Jr. , had intervened two and a halt years earlier on behalf of a client to obtain a half-mil ? lion-dollar loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corpo ? ration . At the end of September , 1951 , the case gravi ? tated to Nixon 's permanent investigations subcommit ? tee , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican National Committee had also been a party to dealings with the RFC . At Senatorial hearings from September 31 to Octobe 5 , 1951 , testimony showed Boyle had made an appoint- ' ment February 28 , 1949 , for officials of the Lithofold Company to see Chairman Harley Hise of the RFC , What made that simple transaction suspect was tha Lithof old had been three times turned down , that it go its loan three days after Boyle 's intercession , and that Boyle , while using his position to arrange for the inter ? view , was being paid a monthly retainer by the com ? pany . In addition it was learned that Boyle had built up a highly lucrative law practice while serving as acting chairman , and had sold out to his partner , Max Siskind , for $150,000 on becoming permanent chairman . Finally , in the case of Gabrielson , it developed that , before he assumed the unpaid chairmanship of the Republican National Committee , he had once represented the Car ? ' thage-Hydrocol Company as president and general counsel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shifting the Issue From this synopsis , manifestly , there was nothing resembling a genuine conflict of interest , but it was plain that both men had been playing politics according to rules that were ancient in Caesar 's time . Nixon took an active part in the questioning , without developing any significant new facts ; and when it became clear that no laws had been violated , he shifted quickly to the moral issue . It was easy to infer that there may have been influence peddling , as there always is , and the RFC , with its political administration and its millions in loans , was as likely a place as any to look for it . " This inquiry has too many loose ends to call it closed , " Nixon announced as the hearings recessed Oc ? tober 5 , " and I think we 'll have to resume hearings . " But no one wanted to thrash a dead ox , except perhaps Nixon . Three days later , in what amounted to a farewell salute to the inquiry , he filed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congression ? al Record ( weeks before a committee report could be filed ) he inserted a careful summation and appraisal of the Boyle-Gabrielson circus . " On the basis of their own testimony , " he said , " both Mr. Boyle and Mr. Gabrielson should resign their posi ? tions as chairmen of the Democratic and Republican National Committees . The basic issue is whether a high official of the national committee of either major political ? cal party should be in a position where he can profit financially from the influence which he may be able to exert with government agencies . . . . " Mr. Boyle says that in making the appointment he was only doing what he would do for any person . . . . He sees no difference in the fact that the appointment in this instance was made for a client . The answer is that when the national chairman of the party in power Intervenes in behalf of a client , such action is influence Jr ' itself , regardless of whether he goes further and ad ? vocates the merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many respects from the Boyle case but the same conclusion must eventually be reached . . . . There is no evidence of improper influ ? ence on behalf of his client during the time he has been chairman . On the other hand , Mr. Gabrielson 's state ? ment that he has no influence can not be acceptdd . He has the power of criticism and the potential power of recommending appointments and promotions . The opportunity for influence exists , and where the oppor ? tunity for influence exists , charges of impropriety are bound to follow . . . . " I see no evidence of illegality or moral turpitude in the actions of either Mr. Boyle or Mr. Gabrielson ... but . . . the paramount need today is to restore public confidence . . . . The top officials of both major parties should set an example of propriety and ethics which goes beyond the strict legal minimum required by law . " From that time on , the Californian continued to capi ? talize on the issue . In November , he accused Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? posed that Congress set up a special committee " or a group of special prosecutors similar to that set up in the Teapot Dome case to investigate charges of corruption in governmental bureaus . " A month later when Truman repeated his determination to deal severely with dis ? honest government workers , Nixon demanded the dis ? missal of Attorney General McGrath and Treasury Sec ? retary Snyder , and asserted the President 's own actions " in defending and condoning unethical practices by members of his own official family have done more than anything else to encourage the decline of morality among government employees . " Champion of Integrity Nixon had subjected himself to some criticism inside the party for his boldness in censuring Gabrielson as well as Boyle ; but in the end , in the climate of mink coats , deep freezes , and big and little scandals that pervaded the closing months of the Truman Adminis ? tration , he emerged as a champion of integrity in public life , a reputation that had no little bearing on his nomination for the Vice Presidency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same battleground , pleading his innocence against charges that , while he had indeed stayed within the " strict legal minimum required by law " in accepting $18,000 in gifts , he had blurred the same ethical lines as the men he had stepped forward to condemn . Again in 1956 , Nixon came under attack when his campaign manager , Murray Chotiner , called on two Presidential assistants at the White House and per ? suaded them to make telephone calls about CAB cases in which he was interested ; on this occasion , Nixon kept silent and the defense took the pragmatic line that Chotiner did no wrong because his clients lost their cases . As for the ethical question ? just what makes an influence peddler ? thit question went begging . The last significant act of Nixon 's Senate career , with in a month of the 1952 nominating convention , found him involved with the national real estate lobby in a move to kill public housing . In that year Congress had authorized construction of 35,000 units of public hous ? ing , and the Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remove the Korean War 's infla ? tionary pressure on rents , had contracted to build 10,000 units . The real estate lobby , therefore , picked Los An ? geles as its first target in a heavily-financed campaign to destroy the program through local action . The Fight Against Public Housing The first move was to subvert the Los Angeles city council which caved in under pressure and voted 8 to 7 to cancel the housing contract and submit the question to a referendum . The council 's action led to a court ruling that the contract was binding , and that even a referendum would be powerless to abrogate it . How ? ever , since the housing proposition had already been printed on the ballot , it was allowed to remain ; and the ensuing straw vote June 3 favored cancellation by a margin of about 8 to 5 , with only a third of the electo ? rate voting . Since this vote was without legal effect , the pressure then shifted to Congress , where Knowland and Nixon agreed to carry the ball . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . Sponsor of the anti-housing campaign was an organization calling itself the " Com ? mittee Against Socialist Housing " or CASH . One of the leaders of CASH was Joseph Crail , an attorney and president of the Coast Federal Savings and Loan Asso ? ciation . As it developed later , when Nixon 's secret fund was made public , Crail was also one of the loyal contrib ? utors to the Senator 's fund , along with two other lead ? ing supporters of CASH . The sequel was not without its ironic overtones . The initial Knowland-Nixon strategem June 12 was to fight for an amendment to the Defense Production Act that would have ordered a halt on any public housing project rescinded by local vote , provided the " community " re ? funded any money already advanced by federal agen ? cies . The proposed language contained no definition at all of who in a " community " would be responsible for making such a refund or how the federal authorities could enforce repayment . The Senate killed that scheme on a technicality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rep. Gordon L. McDonough solved their problem June 27 in the House by tacking a variation of the amendment onto a supplemental appropriation bill , dur ? ing the rush toward adjournment . It might have slipped through the Senate also but for the watchfulness of Sen. Joseph C. O'Mahoney , but at the latter 's insistence the language of the rider was cleaned up to provide that , any such contract cancellation , the local " governing body " must have " tendered the United States full re ? imbursement . " In that form the legislation achieved nothing , for neither CASH nor the Los Angeles city council nor the Los Angeles Housing Authority was prepared to refund $13 million in federal money already invested in the project ! Hence the contract was fulfilled , not cancelled , Nixon 's part in the affair attracted relatively little attention at the time , except for the position he took on the Senate floor June 12 in advocating the proposal . Knowing that the referendum nine days earlier had been legally meaningless and had expressed the view of only a minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The question before us . . . is whether or not Congress believes the federal government should force down the throats of people of a local community a public housing . contract which they have voted to rescind and on which they are willing to reimburse the federal govern ? ment . . . . " It seems to me that the issue is clear ; and under the circumstances members on both sides of the aisle , re ? gardless of how they may feel about public housing or its merits ? because that is not what is involved here - should vote to recognize the clearly expressed intent of the law and the will of the people . " Aside from the verdict of the 1952 Republican con ? vention , the only contemporary assessment of Nixon 's contribution in the Senate came from a poll of political scientists conducted by Dr. B. L. Johnson of Denver and Dr. W. E. Butt of Pennsylvania . In the poll , legislative specialists in the American Political Science Association rated Senators on domestic and foreign attitudes , legis ? lative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 on the list were Douglas , Kefauver , Morse , Lehman , Fulbright , Smith ( Maine ) , Lodge , Aiken , Saltonstall , and McMahon . McCarthy beat out Jenner for last place . Nixon was rated 71st among the 96 Senators .
