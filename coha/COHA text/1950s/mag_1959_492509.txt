DDAY PART TWO By DAVID HOWARTH The British Air Drop At twenty minutes past midnight in the dark , cloudy sky above Normandy , the first of the parachutists jumped and the first of the glider pilots cast off from their tugs to drift down in silence on the wind . Their target for D Day was the eastern end of the invasion shore and its three waterways  --  the Caen Canal , which runs from the sea to the city eight miles inland : the Orne River , which is close to the canal ; and then , five miles farther east , the Dives River . On this fateful day , June 6 , 1944 , the main German armored reserves were in the area east of Caen . The role of the British 6th Airborne Divisign was to drop in the five-mile strip between the two rivers and protect the sea-borne forces againstarmored counterattack while they were landing . This task called for speed and good timing . Before dawn on June sixth the division had to win a territory of twenty-five square miles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns were carried in gliders , but nobody before had ever attempted an accurate landing in enemy country of large numbers of gliders in the dark . Nevertheless , under Maj. Gen. Richard Gale , the division evolved a plan which looked promising , The keys to it were seven small bridges  --  fivti over the Dives River , one over the Orne and one over the canal . The Germans had flooded the valley of the Dives as part of their scheme of defense , creating a marsh from half a mile to four miles wide . No doubt they assumed that control of the river bridges would be in their hands , but Gale decided to destroy the bridges by surprise attacks and so turn the barrier of the marshes to his own account . With these five bridges down , German armor could not attack from the cast and Gale could concentrate his antitank defenses to the south . The Orne and the Caen Canal , on the other hand , lay between his own landing zones and the British beaches from which he would ultimately be reinforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be captured intact . When the division 's plan was completed . the main events of the night appeared as follows : . 12:20 a.m . A force in gliders to land at the Orne and canal bridges . Pathfinders to drop by parachute , to mark out dropping zones for the main parachute forces . 12:50 A.M. Main parachute drop to begin . Objectives : to demolish the Dives bridges , reinforce the defense of the Orne and canal bridges , capture a coast-defense battery , seize the territory between the rivers and clear landing zones for the main glider force . 3:30 A.M. Main force of seventy-two gliders to land with antitank armament , transport and heavy equipment . Each of these separate actions depended on the quick success of those before it . And dawn began at 5:30 . Much had to be accomplished in the seven hours ' darkness of the late-spring night . The pathfinders and the first gliders of the British Army came down in groups between the rivers . At almost the same moment , American landings started fifty miles away on the Cherbourg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first troops in action were probably three platoons of the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry , for this was the force assigned to capture the Caen Canal bridge . At midnight these platoons were close to the coast of France , cooped in pitch-dark Horsa gliders towed by Halifax bombers . In the leading glider everyone was singing Abie , My Boy . Almost all the men were Cockneys , and wisecracks flew around . Over the channel somebody dropped a machine-gun magazine with a metallic clang . " Old so-and-so 's dropped ' is false teeth . " a voice said cheerfully . It seemed tremendously funny at the time , but heaven knows what fears were hidden behind the laughter : for apart from the apprehension of the coming battle , these men knew that their glider was going to crash deliberately . The situation of the Caen Canal bridge demanded this desperate measure . The bridge is a large steel structure which can be raised to let ships through . At its western end arc the first houses of the village of Benouville . A quarter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge across the Orne . British Intelligence had learned that both these bridges were under guard and wired for demolition . Air reconnaissance had shown trenches , barbed wire and concrete pillboxes . To capture them was therefore a matter of split-second surprise . It had to be done before the guards had time to make up their minds to press the blow-up button . The glider pilots confidently promised to crash-land six gliders within three minutes of 12:20 A.M. , three at each bridge and all within a few paces of the abutments  --  and to do it without killing their passengers . The passengers in this deadly experiment were led by Maj. John Howard , one of the company commanders of the Oxford and Buckinghamshire . Howard was a regular officer , thirty years old , who for the first two years of the war had commanded a training company . Angrily impatient for combat duty , he heard in 1942 that the " Ox and Bucks " were going airborne and decided to join them . Just before he made that decision , John Howard had married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her he had decided to become a parachutist , she told him she was going to have a baby . That was an unpromising beginning for an airborne career , but Joy understood his professional pride and did her best to hide her anxiety . A month before D Day their second child was born . The flight across the channel took one hour and twenty-four minutes , a curious pause between the end of the preparations and the beginning of battle . Howard 's thoughts were a mixture . He thought about Joy . He thought that it was a wonder he was not being airsick  --  he had always been sick on training flights ; it had become a standing joke in his company . And he thought with pride of his 160 men . Many of them were hardly more than boys : they had always done everything he told them , and he felt responsible for their fate . Next to him in the glider , for example , was Lt. Den Brotheridge , the platoon commander . Brotheridge had been a cadet in Howard 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air-borne forces . Howard knew that Brotheridge had a young wife with a baby on the way , and he reflected now that without his persuasion Brotheridge would not have been there at all . On the other side of Howard , at the controls of the glider , was Staff Sergeant Wallwork . Howard had told Wallwork and the other pilots that he wanted the first glider to stop with its nose inside the wire defenses of the bridge and the others to stop ten yards behind and five yards to the right . He had no idea how such precision could be achieved , but the pilots had made light of it , and his troops had caught their mood of confidence . Sitting there in the dark , listening to the singing and the rush of air , Howard thought over these special worries of his own and also the worry which beset almost every man who was crossing the channel that night . Did the Germans know they were coming ? Were they run ning into an ambush ? In the pause between songs Ile heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' As n't the major bin sick yet ? " 12:16 : Wallwork turned in the pilot 's seat and shouted , " Casting off ! " Howard called for silence , and the singing died . The towrope fell away . As the glider 's speed fell off , Brotheridge undid his safety belt and stood up , with Howard and the platoon sergeant holding him , and swung open the forward door . Cold air streamed in . The glider banked steeply to the right , and peering into the darkness beneath , Howard glimpsed a dimly gleaming ribbon : the Caen Canal . " Hold tight ! " Walhvork said . All the platoon linked arms and lifted their feet off the floor and sat there waiting . The concussion was shattering . The glider tore into the earth at ninety miles an hour and careened across the tiny field with a noise like thunder as timber cracked and split and smashed itself to pieces . Then suddenly everything was still . The doorway had crumpled into wreckage , but in front of Howard was a jagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it head first and fell on the earth of France , picked himself up and felt his limbs for broken bones . There against the night sky , precisely where it should have been , less than 100 yards away , was the steel lattice tower of the bridge . Brotheridge came running round the tail . " All right ? " he said . " Yes , " Howard said . " Carry on . " Brotheridge shouted his platoon letter , " Able ! Able ! " to rally the men who were tumbling out of the wreckage , and the action began which they had rehearsed on bridges all over England . A phos-phorus smoke bomb was thrown at the pillbox by the bridge . A machine gun opened fire from the pillbox , but one man ran forward under cover of the smoke and dropped a Mills grenade through the gun port , and the platoor scrambled across the wire barrier whict the glider had demolished , up an eal ? bankment onto the road , and with yell ! of " Able ! Able ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second ma chine gun on the far side . Howard made for the spot he hat named as his command post , followef by his radio operator . Corporal Tap penden . He heard crashes behind him-the two other gliders coming in . Soot his second and third platoons came run ning through the darkness , shoutin . " Baker ! " and " Charley ! " The German sentry on the bridge wa a young man Inwiinn ( ? 1. /ram Page 8N ) named Helmut ! Writer . He saw the first glider crash and thought it was LI bomber , because there were heavy air raids going on in Caen and along the coast , When men with blackened faces charged across the bridge , he was taken by surprise . He ran for the trenches . There was no lime for the guard to turn out . but a noncom fired the machine gun and shot down the first of the men who were coming across the bridge . Then the wave of them broke into trenches on the far side of the bridge , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash the attack had succeeded . Engineers searched for the demolition wiring and disconnected it . With the bridge in their hands , the infantry went on to dear out the houses beyond it . One man came back to tell Howard they were finished . " But Mr. Brotheridge is hurt , sir , " he said . By Howard 's side , Corporal Tappenden was trying to call on his radio the other half of the company , which by then should have landed at the Orne bridge down the road . He could get no answer . Men came back over the bridge carrying Brotheridge on a stretcher . He was still alive , but Howard knew that the man he had persuaded to go air-borne was going to be the first to die in action . Tappenden looked up from his radio . " I 've raised them , sir ! They got the other bridge ! " The attack on the Ome bridge had been a walkover . The leading platoon , commanded by Lieutenant Fox , got to the bridge just in time to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like an exercise . The commander of the second platoon , running breathlessly onto the bridge , found Fox there , staring down at the dark water of the Orne . " How 's it gone ? " he asked anxiously . " It 's gone all right , " Fox said . But where the hell are the umpires ? " Howard had been allotted two code words to signal the success of his attack . The capture of the canal bridge was to be reported by radio to brigade headquarters by the word " ham . " For the Orne bridge the word was " jam . " Corporal Tappenden could not get an acknowledgment from brigade , and for half an hour , squatting by the roadside , he broadcast those pregnant words , " Ham and jam . " Nobody at brigade headquarters heard Howard 's signal because all the brigade signal equipment had disappeared in the drop  --  the first symptom of a difficulty which was to bring the whole air-borne attack to the edge of disaster . The pathfinders of the division were parachutists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up lights and radio beacons on which the main parachute forces would be dropped . Troubled by wind and cloud , air crews had dropped the pathfinders farther eastward than planned . They had to set out their beacons where they were , although one of the Improvised zones was dangerously close to the Floodlands of the Dives . Close behind the aircraft of the pathfinders were those of the 3rd Parachute Brigade , assigned to destroy the five bridges across the Dives River and a powerful coast defense battery at Merville , near the mouth of the Orne . The Merville battery commanded the beaches on which the left flank of the British 3rd Division was to land at dawn . If the battery was still in action at the break of day , it would cause havoc . The job of silencing it was given to the 9th Parachute Battalion , whose commander was Lt. Col. T. B. H. Otway . When the brigadier had first given Away his orders he had described the job , quite rightly , as a stinker . Reconnaissance had shown that the guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belt of barbed wire . Outside this was a mine field thirty yards wide , and outside that a second barbed-wire entanglement . Beyond all this was a further 100 yards of mines surrounded by a wire fence . Intelligence estimated that the place was held by 200 men with ten machine guns and two dual-purpose cannon . Otway 's battalion had to march a mile and a half to this stronghold and capture it by 5:15 . At that moment , if they had not fired a colored rocket as a signal of success , the Navy was to shell the spot . The only support offered to Otway was a preliminary bombing attack by 100 Lan-casters of the R.A.F. But neither shelling nor bombing was expected to destroy the battery . The only way to destroy it was to get inside it . Terence Otway was twenty-nine , and at that age he commanded 750 of the toughest of British troops . He was slim and lightly built ; one might have taken him for an artist rather than a colonel of paratroops . But such appointments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had entered the Royal Military College , Sandhurst , and been commissioned 91 into the army , intending to stay only five years . The five years expired a few months before World War 11 began , so he had not been allowed to resign . By D Day he had served for ten years and had revealed  --  perhaps to his own surprise  --  an incisive military brain . When he had been told  --  four months before the invasion  --  what his battalion was expected to do . he began to train his men with fantastic thoroughness . He went out with the secret maps and photographs of Merville to find a stretch of English countryside which resembled the surroundings of the battery and found one near Newbury in Berkshire . Within two days he had had it requisitioned and persuaded the government to pay for 15,000 pounds ' worth of crops which he had to destroy and had begun to build a duplicate of the battery and its defenses . On this artificial stage the battalion rehearsed its attack again and again , using live ammunition . Otway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put sixty of his men in three gliders and crash-land them inside the defenses , right against the walls of the gun emplacements , at the moment the attack began . But it was obvious that the sixty men would have even less chance than the rest of living through the action . He assembled his A Company , told them what he had planned and called for volunteers . This procedure was no more than a formality , because the whole company took a smart pace forward , and it was left to him and the company commander to select the sixty men . Antiaircraft fire began as they crossed the coast of France . Otway had his first warning that the drop was going to go wrong when the pilot began to throw the aircraft about in violent evasive action . The effect on the drill of the parachutists was chaotic . When they tried to move down to the door to jump , the sudden lurches threw them off balance . Some fell on the floor , encumbered by heavy equipment . Others tripped over them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hold your course , you fool ! " " We 've been hit in the tail ! " one of the air crew shouted back , " You can still fly straight , ca n't you ' ? " Otway asked angrily . But before he was given an answer , the signal came to jump . Otway 's turn was early . In those few seconds of heavenly quiet which reward a parachutist between the shock of the jump and the shock of the landing , Otway looked down , seeing the terrain clearly in diffused moonlight . There was the dark square of the wood which was his rendezvous . Beyond it , gleams betrayed the sodden marshlands of the Dives River . Below him were fields with thick black hedges , and across the fields , downwind , a farmhouse which he recognized . It was the last place he wanted to land , for it was marked on his map as a German battalion headquarters . He hit the wall of the house itself , some feet above the ground , and dropped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there already . A German threw open an upstairs window and leaned out . One of the men with Otway picked up a brick and threw it . There was a crash of glass and the German put his head in . Otway and his companions ran to the back of the house , while the German staff poured out of the front door . Among the men who jumped with Otway was his batman , whose name was Wilson . Before the war Wilson had been a professional boxer and a professional valet , and nobody could have had better qualifications as an air-borne colonel 's batman ; but his drop was even unluckier than his colonel 's . The German headquarters building had a greenhouse attached , and Wilson went through the roof 92 and landed in a shower of broken glass among the flowerpots . None the worse , he set off for the wood alone . As Otway hurried toward the rendezvous he picked up a few men heading for the wood in twos and threes . On the way they heard strangled cries and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mud was a parachutist , struggling , sunk to his shoulders in the ghastly slime . They reached his parachute and hauled in the lines till they were taut . Half a dozen men were on the lines before the end came , but fighting for a foothold themselves they could not overcome the suction of the bog . Still shouting for help , the man sank lower . The unknown man gave a last cry before the mud silenced him . When Otway got to the wood he met his second in command , who said , " Thank God you 've come , sir . " " Why ? " Otway asked . " The drop 's a ghastly chaos . There 's hardly anyone here . " It was nearly two o'clock . Only a few men had reached the wood . Glancing round , Otway became aware of Wilson , ever the perfect servant , proffering a small flask . " Shall we take our brandy now , sir ? " Wilson said . As time crept on in the darkness below the trees , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Otway had to face a disaster worse than anything he . had imagined . His plans had been flexible , but nobody could have planned for a drop in which only a handful of men survived and only a few odds and ends of equipment could be found . By 2:30 A.M. , only 150 men had come in . Six hundred were missing . They had only one machine gun . Their mortars and antitank guns and mine detectors and radios and all their heavy equipment had disappeared . Otway was in a dilemma . He had to decide whether to throw his remaining men into an attack which seemed to be suicidal and doomed to failure or whether to save them for secondary objectives , leaving the Merville battery to the Air Force and the Navy . If he decided to attack , he had to decide exactly when to move . There was still a mile and a half to go . and the Germans were thoroughly alerted . If he moved too soon , he would lose the help of any men who might still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , he would not be on hand when the gliders came in . So for an hour , in the solitude of command , Otway prowled round the group of men who were waiting in the wood and wrestled with his problem . The only man to whom he showed his fears was Wilson . At a quarter to three , the time of final decision had arrived . " What the hell am I going to do , Wilson ? " Otway said . " Only one thing to do . sir , " Wilson answered . " No need to ask me . " Otway laughed . " Yes , I know , " he said . " Get the officers and N.C.O. 's . We 'll move in five minutes . " The officers and noncoms gathered round him , and he told them they were going to attack with exactly one fifth of the battalion . At ten minutes to three they moved out of the wood in single file . Shortly after the start , Otway met the commander of a reconnaissance party which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , and some was bad . He had cut the outer fence and crossed the large mine field to the inner belt of the wire . Engineers who had landed with him to clear a path through the mines had not found their mine detectors , but they had got through by searching for mines with their fingers . But the bombing attack had been a washout . The La ncasters had loosed their bombs not on the battery but half a mile away on the dropping zone of the reconnaissance party . Men drifting down on their parachutes had heard bombs whistling past and seen them explode below , When the 150 men reached the outer wire the final blow awaited Otway 's plans . It was 4:30 A.M. His gliders were due . Until that moment he had clung to a hope that somebody would turn up with the mortar flares with which he should have signaled the gliders in to land . But no flares came , Precisely on time he saw two of the three gliders and their tugs approaching . The tugs flashed their headlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gliders circled down . Otway had no way , of telling them he was there and ready to attack . Without a signal , they would veer away . He saw one glider skim over the battery , a hundred feet up , but it turned off to come down behind him . With this last hope gone , he gave the signal to attack . The battle was short and terrible and bloody . Otway established his command post beside the gap in the outer wire and waited there with Wilson and his adjutant and signal officer , while the first men crept forward to blow gaps in the inner wire . He saw the explosions . At once a fury of fire burst from the battery defenses . Silhouetted against the tracers , his men were moving across the mine field , running and dropping down to shoot or to lie where death had found them . That was his own moment to advance . Irrelevantly the thought flashed through his head of what Wilson would think of him if he hesitated . He shouted , " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . The officer beside him fell , shot through by a machine gun . Otway flung himself down inside the wire . The remnants of a company he had kept in reserve came through behind him and dropped down , waiting for his orders . He had planned that the leading companies were to go straight in for the guns , wasting no time on troops outside the casemate . This they did . In a few minutes he could see them right up against the casemates , firing through the openings . He ordered the reserve company up to clear the trenches . Soon shouts in German were heard ? " Paratroops ! " ? and Germans began to surrender . In twenty minutes from his first order it was over . His men were in the casemates , doing their best to blow up the guns by stuffing German bombs into the breeches . The rocket was fired to signal success . A spotting aircraft passed on the signal to the Navy , fifteen minutes before the shelling was due to begin . Otway 's gallant remnant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their hand-to-hand fighting , but victory gave them no feeling of elation . On the contrary , when the men assembled they were pale and silent . Of the 150 who had charged twenty minutes before , seventy-five , exactly half , were now lying dead or wounded ; and of the 200 Germans in defense , only twenty-two could still rise to their feet to surrender . The battalion had other assignments that morning , and before dawn Otway marched off , with one out of ten of all the men who had embarked with him . They were extremely angry with the Air Force for the chaos of their drop . Later , when they heard what had happened to their vanished comrades , the news did nothing to calm their feelings . Some had been landed twenty or thirty miles away . Navigators had mistaken the Dives River for the Orne River and cast out their troops on the wrong side of the marshes . Some of these scattered men got back to their unit in the end . One sergeant turned up four days later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped thirty miles inland and bringing also , like scalps , the paybooks of a number of German officers . But a great many of the scattered troops were killed or captured . Of Otway 's 750 men , 192 were never heard of again , alive or dead . Very likely the quagmires of the Dives closed over their heads and their bodies lie buried there today . Fortunately , Major General Gale , the divisional commander- , was not discouraged by the scattering of his forces . He knew that no other battalion had suffered quite so much as Otway 's . Besides , he was an old soldier , used to the setbacks of war . Richard Gale had fought in the bloodier battles of the First World War and had won his Military Cross in 1918 . He was six feet three , and he would have been delighted to think that his juniors feared his displeasure  --  as they did  --  more than they feared the Germans . The general himself landed with the main glider force at 3:30 A.M. With him were his aide-de-camp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcycle and two or three of his headquarters staff . His landing was rough , but nobody was seriously hurt , and the general stepped out to a scene which in less experienced eyes appeared disastrous . With the help of two air-borne bulldozers , the parachutists had cleared the glider landing zone in time , removing the posts which the Germans had planted . Of seventy-two gliders dispatched , forty-nine landed on time and right on the cleared meadow . For two or three minutes they converged from all directions in the dark . Wheels , undercarriages , wings were torn off . Some buried their noses in the soft ground . some collided . One went right through a small cottage and emerged bearing with it a double bed  --  rumor said that a French couple were still in the bed when everything came to rest . By 3:35 the meadow was covered with wrecks  --  yet most of the passengers survived . Upward of 1000 men scrambled out , dragging with them their jeeps and ten out of eighteen of the antitank guns . The general 's jeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than wait he set off for his headquarters in Ranville on foot . The night passed without any news of the demolition of the five bridges on the Dives River , by which the division 's flank was to be protected . One troop of Royal Engineers assigned to destroy the Robehomme bridge , had fallen mostly in the marshes . The bridge was blown by a solitary sergeant who happened to drop nearby ; he had borrowed explosives from Canadians who had come down there by mistake . The most important of the bridges was the one which carried the main road from Caen to Rouen and Le Havre across the river , just beyond the small town of Troarn . This bridge was four miles outside the area which the division intended to hold . It was planned that a troop of engineers under Maj. J. C. A. Roseveare , protected by infantry , should dash for this bridge while the Germans were still confused . They were to carry explosives in jeeps and trailers  --  to be landed in gliders . But this plan also went astray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no landmarks which he knew . Gliders were landing in the darkness nearby , but not the gliders which were carrying his jeeps . lie rallied what men h could  --  six officers and about forty er listed men ; of the protecting infantr there were only twenty . They ( nun plenty of explosives , but there was nosh ing to carry them in except handcart ! This party set off under mortar an machine-gun fire to haul the carts up steep hill . Before long they came to crossroads signpost which told them the had dropped two miles too far north . Th Troarn bridge was seven miles away , an there was little hope of hauling the cart that far before dawn  --  no hope at all a hauling them through the town by day Just then a jeep with a trailer appeare from the darkness . It was not an cog fleets ' jeep ; it belonged to the Roya Army Medical Corps , and it was full o medical supplies . The engineers dumper the medical stores and loaded explosive By then it was four o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to Tro am . Roseveare sent most of his fore across country to another , nearer bridge He himself took the wheel of the jeep ant piled one officer and seven other men or the jeep and trailer . When they reached the main road or the edge of the town , Roseveare sent twt scouts ahead . A German soldier rode past on a bicycle . The scouts pulled the unlucky man off his bicycle and , becaust he began to shout , they killed him ; bu they foolishly did it with a Sten gun ant so gave the alert to the town . Stealth was useless after that . Rose veare trod on the gas , but the overloadet jeep and trailer would do only abou thirty-five miles an hour . Soon they wen under fire from the houses . One man lz then had dropped off somewhere . The in maining seven passengers fired back with Sten guns and a Bren . At a bend in the road they saw the main street extendint for a mile , downhill toward the bridge There the tiring was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the floorboards . The overloadex jeep ground slowly forward . The passer gers blazed away in all directions . It wa the hill that saved the situation . On th downward grade the jeep picked ul speed , swerving from side to side of th road as the trailer swayed behind , ant tore out of the town pursued by shot from a heavy machine gun . They came t , the bridge and found it unguarded . Fiv minutes later the job was done . The bias dropped the center span of the bridge i the river . They drove the jeep up a sid track and ditched it , just as the sun wa rising ; and they reached the air-horn perimeter again that afternoon . By dawn , in spite of the scattered dror the division had achieved every one of immediate objectives . But it was still to soon for General Gale to congratulai himself : A counterattack was certain t come . Men were still creeping lost throug the hedgerows and forests or lying alor in pain . Many who had started the nigl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn the living heard a sour which encouraged them : Behind a sound of aircraft and bombs and sma guns close at hand , an even deeper thui der shook the earth . On the canal bridge , one of Majt Howard 's corporals listened . " Hear the sir ? " he said . " That 's the Navy . " Before long the enormous naval she ! were passing overhead , ranging on targe ten miles inland . One could hear the rumbling across the sky from north south . The corporal , hearing this extra. : dinary noise for the first time , looked as if he hoped to see the shells . " Cur , " said , " what next ? They 're tiring jeeps . "
