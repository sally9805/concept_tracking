In the old days , no one ever dared arrest a member of the ruling dynasty of Tunisia . But last week Prince Salaheddine , boisterous third son of the Bey of Tunis , languished in a jail charged with attempted murder of a police inspector ( he had played once too often his favorite game of driving full speed toward a cop and slamming on the brakes just in time ) . Salaheddine 's arrest was a sign that the end was near . Before the week was out the 76-year-old Bey , whose family has ruled Tunisia for 250 years , was unceremoniously toppled from his throne , and the throne itself ( both as an institution and a piece of furniture ) was tossed on the scrap heap of history . <P> <P> Out of Trouble . The descendants of a Greek renegade first placed on the throne by the Turkish masters of the Ottoman Empire , the Husseinite Beys of Tunis became in later years little more than abject puppets of French colonial rule . With personal prerogatives rivaling those of true oriental potentates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France pays its own President ) , the Beys had only to pile up their wealth and stay out of trouble . Since dynastic law provided that each Bey should be succeeded by the eldest male relative on his father 's side , most had reached a state of pleasantly senile complaisance by the time they reached the throne . <P> The last of the lot , spade-bearded El Amin , had a passionate concern for antique clocks , and an urge to garb himself in bemedaled uniforms of the old Ottoman army . He made an impressive showpiece at royal functions , never bothered to learn French , and gazed tolerantly at the antics of a huge and predatory family . <P> <P> Out of Office . During the early years of insurgent Tunisian nationalism , El Amin refused to put his royal seal on a few French decrees . The irritated French ringed his palace with soldiers to put him back in line . The Bey 's gesture was enough to keep him on the throne for a while after Tunisia got its independence . But Tunisia 's modern-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to tolerate the antique dynasty for long . Gradually the Premier cut down on the royal prerogatives . Two weeks ago , Bourguiba announced in a weekly broadcast : " The hour of reckoning will come . The country can not continue to suffer evil in high places . " <P> Last week Tunisian ambassadors from all over the world were summarily recalled to Tunis . After meeting with them and with the executive committee of his own ruling Neo-Destour Party , Bourguiba called a special session of the nation 's Constituent Assembly . In a hall from which the Bey 's old throne had disappeared , the governing body of Tunisia voted unanimously to 1 ) do away with the monarchy , 2 ) establish a republic , 3 ) make Habib Bourguiba its first President . " Because of the affection of the people for me , " Bourguiba said cockily , " I could have myself declared Bey . But I urge the people to choose a republic . "                 @ @ @ @
