In Manhattan 's Aeolian Hall one afternoon in 1925 , Conductor " Walter Damrosch put down his baton , turned to the audience that had just listened to the first performance of a new work by an unknown young composer . Roared Damrosch , in facetious disavowal of music that he had nonetheless thought well worth performing : " If a young man of 23 can write a symphony like that , in five years he will be ready to commit murder . " <P> Many a listener , nerves frayed by the dissonances and the jerky jazzy rhythms he had just heard , sourly agreed . But time has proved audience and conductor wrong . Nobody has ever accused Aaron Copland of murder , even murder of harmony and counterpoint , and this week he reached his soth birthday the most-played and most-honored of living U.S.-born composers . From all over the world , his colleagues were letting him know it . <P> A Bill for Boston . U.S. composers in particular have a lot to thank Copland for . In a way , homely , friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brooklyn , " on a street . . . that can only be described as drab , " he survived the iron classical discipline of his first teachers , then , at 20 , took off for Paris and the " encouraging " teaching of Nadia Boulanger ( TIME , March 31 , 1947 ) . Other U.S. composers-Virgil Thomson , Walter Piston , Roy Harris , Marc Blitz-stein-were soon following the same Paris path . <P> In 1924 , Copland came back to a U.S. that was not accustomed to paying a cent to a serious native composer for the privilege of performing his music ; it was supposed to be gratification enough for an American to get his work played at all . With the help of Serge Koussevitzky , then conducting his first season with the Boston Symphony , Copland blazed that trail too . " Send them a bill ! " commanded Koussevitzky after a rehearsal of the young composer 's Symphony for Organ and Orchestra . Copland sent the symphony society a modest bill ( " maybe $25 , I 've forgotten " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Composer Henry F. Gilbert about his check , Gilbert clasped his head in mingled joy and disbelief . <P> Copland was the first U.S. composer to win a commission ( for his Music for the Theater ) from the newly formed League of Composers , the first to be awarded a Guggenheim fellowship . He has also collected a Pulitzer Prize , in 1945 , for Appalachian Spring , and a Hollywood " Oscar " this year , for his score for The Heiress . <P> A Flirtation with Jazz . One night last week , Manhattan 's musical advance guard gathered in the Museum of Modern Art auditorium to help the League of Composers pay Composer Copland a birthday tribute , and to hear a retrospective reminder of the musical trails Copland has traveled and how far " they have led him .
