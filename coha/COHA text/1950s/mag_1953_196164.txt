Old men puffed frostily , and baby-laden women walked beside them with chattering teeth . It was not yet dawn , and chilly , but on the mountain paths leading to Sanare. 4,400 ft. up in the western Venezuelan Andes , and on the rutty road leading to Sanare from the " outside . " everyone was elated . Hardly a young man among the 5.000 travelers was not carrying a guitar , a violin or a pair of maracas ( seed-filled gourds ) . Making up words as they went along , they sang : <P> We 're going to see the tractor , The marvelous tractor of Sanare ! <P> Reaching Sanare , the throng poured into the sports stadium . There stood a wonderful brute of a tractor , aflutter with flags and painted a fire-engine red . The timid countrymen hung back , black eyes shining-although as members of the Friends of Sanare Society , they were all part-owners of the tractor . <P> Sanare is an area rich in coffee , fruit and flowers , but its 15,000 farmers are poor because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out inefficiently over mule paths . To remedy this situation , the society last March resolved to buy a roadbuilding tractor . " Even the poorest farmhands gave a bolivar ( 30 ) , and one rich man sent 10,000 , " said Pablo Jose Tamayo , president of the society . " But he who gave 10,000 is neither more nor less the owner than the man who gave only one . " Last August , having raised 95,000 bolivars , the Friends ordered an International Harvester TD-24 with bulldozer . <P> The fiesta marking its arrival began with an open-air Mass and a blessing of the machine . Then the Friends of Sanare feasted on rum and roast veal , and danced their traditional step , the tamunangue . Next day , in Sanare 's old colonial plaza , they gathered and Mayor Rodriguez Diaz climbed upon the tractor . <P> " I speak at this emotional moment , " he said , " not as your mayor , but as a simple son of Sanare . And this is all I want to ' say . They tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be so . But of one thing I am sure : the people of Sanare have a heart of 148 horsepower ! " <P> " Ole ! Ole ! " cried the crowd . <P> The following day the tractor was put to work , and last week it completed its first task , scooping out a small reservoir . Then it turned to roadmaking . Plodding away from the fiesta , a Friend of Sanare had said , " Next year , when we celebrate the machine 's birthday , possibly we shall not have to walk . " An old woman added . " If God wills it , and the Virgin . " And then someone struck a chord on a guitar , and they walked off singing : <P> Sanare has a machine , A beautiful machine , That knows how to make roads .
