txt Approval by the House of Representatives of the biggest military construction program in either peacetime or war was held up today by a demand that a $19,019 , - 000 expansion of the Grandview Airport , near Kansas City , Mo. , be eliminated . The airport is where President Truman 's private plane lands when he visits his home at Independence . The whole program , containing $470,200,000 of work on overseas bases and $302,200,000 of topsecret installations , was estimated to cost $5,768,720,328 . The pending measure is an authorization and would be followed by an appropriation later . The demand for the elimination of the Grandview Airport was made by Representative H. R. Gross , Republican of Iowa . He termed it " a glorified W. P. A. project " to provide super-accommodations for Mr. Truman and jobs for his neighbors . In hot justification of the improvements , Representative Carl Vinson , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , told the House that Grandview Airport was to become the headquarters of the Continental Air-Command , which now is at Mitchel Field , L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " against my better judgment . " The Defense Department had notified Senator James P. Kern , Republican of Missouri , last month that the headquarters of the Continental Air Command would be moved to Grandview Airport some time after June of 1953 . The command was organized in December of 1948 to strengthen the Air National Guard and Air Reserve Programs and to handle administra- tion and training of all civilian components of the Air Force . It has no tactical functions . An amendment by Mr. Gross to strike Grandview out was defeated , 56-16 , with a sparse membership present . Later he moved that the whole $5,000,000,000 program be sent back to committee with instructions to kill the Missouri project , and asked for a record vote . Because of week-end absentees , House leaders had agreed to forego record votes temporarily , so the measure remained blocked until next Tuesday . Meanwhile , the $56,062,405,890 Department of Defense appropriation bill , which the House approved yesterday , was received by the Senate , and work was under way to prepare it for floor action within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops-for-Europe issue , the most controversial phase of the House consideration of the bill , would arise in the Senate . Senate Resolved on Limit Last spring the Senate adopted a resolution opposing the sending of more than six divisions of ground troops to Europe to implement the North Atlantic Treaty without further approval by Congress . In the House yesterday , Representative Frederic R. Coudert Jr. , Republican of New York , offered an amendment designed to write this Senate expression into law . It was rejected by a vote of 131 to 84 . The vote was given erroneously in THE NEW YORK TIMES this morning as 131 to 18 . Today Senator Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska , the Senate Republican leader , who offered the original Senate troops-to-Europe limitation proposal , said he had no present intention of reopening the question during debate on the appropriation bill . He said he considered the Senate 's expression of last spring sufficient , and assumed that the military would consult with Congress if developments indicated a need for sending troops beyond the currently planned six divisions . Senator Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subcommittee in charge of the bill , the largest single peacetime military money measure in Congressional memory , had completed testimony-taking on the Army ( $20,798,845,700 ) and Navy ( $15,737,920,000 ) budget estimates for the current fiscal year . The Air Force estimates totaling $20 , - 501,143,000 , he said , would be taken up next Tuesday . Before votes were taken on appropriation proposals , Senator O'Mahoney said , he wanted the subcommittee to go into objectives and many basic economic and military factors with the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . War Cost Not Included " This $56,000,000,000 bill , " Senator O'Mahoney said , " does not give the whole picture of the fiscal year 's military program by far . Nor does it indicate the whole program 's impact on the national economy . " " The measure does not provide for this year 's costs of fighting the war in Korea ( estimated as at least $4,500,000,000 ) . It does not include the $5,768,720,328 military construction program , or the recommended $8,500,000,000 foreign military and economic assistance program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must be remembered that the American economy is our first line of defense . " The $5,768,000,000 military construction bill contains hundreds of projects in twenty-four states and the District of Columbia , the territories and possessions and at foreign points , some secret , on a global scale . In New York it calls for $51,427,800 of construction divided among posts as follows : ARMY ? At Fort Jay , Pine Camp , Schenectady General Depot , Seneca Ordnance Depot , the Signal Corps Photographic Center , New York ; the United States Military Academy and Watervliet Arsenal . NAVY ? At the Naval Shipyard at Brooklyn and the Naval Air Station at Niagara Falls . AIR FORCE ? At Mitchel Field , Niagara Falls Airport , Suffolk County Airport , Samson Air Force Base , Griffis Air Force Base and Cornell University . The $5,768,720,328 was scaled down , Mr. Vinson told the House , from some $12,000,000,000 of requests from the armed services . He emphasized that the program was scaled down to the minimum ' essential for armed Forces totaling 3,500,000 men and an Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsor of a bill that would increase the Air Force to 138 combat wings , plus ' twenty-five troopcarrier wings . His measure also called for three , rather than one , new super-carriers for the Navy , each of 59,000 tons and capable of launching and landing the heaviest , and longest-range bombing planes . The Armed Services Committee anticipated questions as to why the facilities left over from World War II would not prevent the presenting of such a huge program in peacetime now . It reported to the House on this in this way : " The beginning of our construction program for World War II and our entry into World War II were practically simultaneous . Speed was of the essence . As a consequence , the great majority of the facilities constructed were either mobilization-type , consisting of frame buildings with unfurnished interiors , or theatre-ofoperation-type which consisted of a wood frame with tarpaper siding . " All of the **25;475;TOOLONG buildings have long since succumbed to the ravages of weather and the same is true of a substantial portion of the wooden-type buildings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were declared surplus and disposed of under the Surplus Property Act , the report added . Further , it was emphasized , the new era of jet planes has made airports obsolete and subject to reconstruction . Still another factor , the report brought out , is that construction costs are now double what they were in 1941.
