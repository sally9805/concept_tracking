WHEN Doctor Zhivago was first pub- lished in the West , it had very favorable reviews . In the United States only the daily reviewer of the New York Times dared suggest that while it was a good book , it might not be as great as his colleagues thought . In the Soviet Union all was quiet until Pas ? ternak was awarded the Nobel Prize ; thereafter the book was treated exclu ? sively as a Cold War property . There can be no doubt about the lit ? erary beauty of the novel . In spite of the organizational weaknesses mentioned by some of the reviewers , Pasternak suc ? ceeded in writing a great piece of poetry in prose . Doctor Zhivago is assured of a very long life even after the Cold War tide has receded . But it is question ? able whether the book is on the whole as revelatory as the critics seem to think , or in the ways they emphasize . In taking a second look at the book , we should keep in mind that Pasternak wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its topical aspects deals with material with which its expected readership has been long and painfully intimately acquainted . There is nothing sensational about Pasternak 's description of the Soviet society , nothing even that has not been long known in the West . What distinguishes it is not its topic ? many other books presented fresher and more startling material . Nor is it the fact that it was written under the heel of the Soviet regime . Aside from its purely lit erary qualities , Doctor Zhivago 's claim to greatness lies in the depth of its phil osophical inquiry and insight . And in this respect the book poses questions that are universal , as relevant for the West as they are for the East . Zhivago lives . They are presented for what they are , relative , and often highly subjective . He does assert the sacred , somehow primordial right of the indi ? vidual to autonomous existence , if that is his need . But he does not protest the price such an individual must pay to the society . Pasternak at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disproportionate , or wrongfully ex ? acted . THERE is a vital relationship between Doctor Zhivago and his society . Never does he become a true outsider . Non-adjusted , yes . Even a reproach to his countrymen who had hounded him to death . But not a curse upon them . In his death as in his life , Doctor Zhivago " bears witness " to the condition of man , to the freedom of his aspirations and to his imperfection . But at no point does he sit in judgment . He had accepted the Russian Revolution for its aspirations . He has never rejected the revolutionary ideal . But once the Revolution became mired in human stupidity and brutality , he had no choice but to go on . Doctor Zhivago is not a case study of the brutal ? ity , stupidity , vengefulness , and moral or intellectual corruption of the " men in the Kremlin " or their henchmen . They , no less than Doctor Zhivago , only point beyond , to the tragic condition of man . In this sense , Pasternak has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have referred to the " primitive Christian " views expressed in the book . They do not seem to comprehend that the " primitivity " of these views is part and parcel of Doctor Zhivago 's quest : they are just as irreconcilable with the organized Church as his other views are with the reigning social order . The novel is a minute and sensitive illustration of the process of privatization that goes on under the conditions of modern totalitarian life . In the assertion of his autonomy Doctor Zhivago is not the " autonomous man " of David Ries-man . He is not free ( as Pasternak is ) to " choose his goals and modulate his pace . " He is clearly driven by the thor ? oughly internalized values he inherited from his pre-Revolutionary Russian in ? tellectual environment . This conclusion is supported not only by our feeling of the compulsive nature of his quest , but also by such circumstantial evidence as his relationship to his children , and his keeping of a diary . Doctor Zhivago 's acceptance of the Revolution as some ? thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance a not-too ? orthodox writer takes out in the Soviet world . It also springs from the values young Zhivago had already internalized . The way in which he subsequently breaks with the post-Revolutionary reality , how ? ever natural appearing to the Western reader , is really inevitable only because of the authoritarian and compulsive na ? ture of his values . Doctor Zhivago never really transcends his past and present . IF this aspect of the novel is autobiographical , it can be only partly so . For judging by all available evidence , Paster ? nak is an autonomous man in the true sense of the word . In 1937 he is said to have refused to sign a petition of the Soviet writers demanding the execution of General Tukhacevsky , and to have escaped retribution only thanks to the other writers who covered up ( ? ) for him . He continued in his poetic creation in spite of official blasts and the disfavor with of the regime . Finally , in 1948 he began writing Doctor Zhivago because , he says , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own name . " No ? where in Pasternak 's career do we find anything that would suggest Zhivago 's kind of compulsive drive , unless it be the drive to create . On the contrary , we have the feeling that every case is carefully considered on its merits , and that he arrives at his decisions freely . Perhaps the key to Pasternak 's free dom lies in the fact that he is not afraid of death . The impression one gets from his behavior as well as from some passages in Doctor Zhivago is one of a man who has stood " in the shadow of Death , " who has experienced its reality , and in that sense had died . His feeling of freedom once he had realized that " his days are numbered " has been expe ? rienced and described by a number of political prisoners of our day , as usu ? ally occurring after their arrest and/or trial . But there is no reason why a man of greater sensitivity and imagination could not live through potential arrest , trial , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pasternak could modulate the measure of his par ? ticipation in the life of the society around him , freely determining his dis ? tance from it . B ECAUSE of its style , his novel has been likened to Tolstoy . But Doc ? tor Zhivago is not a book or horizontal vistas . One thinks of an eagle soaring overhead . Because he is looking down upon the scene , he does not see " sides " : " It 's only in mediocre books that people are divided into two camps and have nothing to do with each other . In real life everything gets mixed up ! " ? If the West now picks out of his work passages critical of the Soviet way of life and celebrates him for the courage of an act of defiance of the Soviet regime in writ ? ing it , it misunderstands him as previ ? ously as his own people do in accusing him of treason . Pasternak is not defiant . He is not heroic , is not even courageous as we understand the word . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " bears witness . " With the same dignity he cabled to Stockholm his reaction to the news of the Nobel Prize award , and later dis ? cussed with Max Frankel of the New York Times the responsibilities he saw facing a Soviet Writer who is also a Nobel Prize winner , adding , " Oh , of course I am extremely happy , but you must understand that I am confident that I will move immediately into this new , lonely role as though it had always been that way . " Only a free man of his under ? standing of how everything can get mixed up in real life , could have com ? mented in the same interview on the growing attack against himself : " I am not a victim of any injustice . I have not been singled out for special treatment . Under the circumstances nothing else could have been done . " Later , with the same frankness he cabled his rejection of the Prize , because of " the meaning attached to it in my country . " Within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his com ? patriots were demanding his expulsion from the Soviet Union , It is prob ? able that the demand was fairly sponta ? neous . But it could not have been more effective had it been carefully calculated . For Pasternak is tied to his people and to his country by strong rational as well as mystical ties . Through them as through an umbilical cord Pasternak the man and the poet receive their nourish ? ment . Cut the cord , and Pasternak 's spiritual death inevitably follows . In this extreme moment Pasternak wrote a letter to the Party , and to Khrushchev person ? ally . As he accepted the honor of the Nobel Prize without false modesty , so now he simply and earnestly pleaded for his life : He pointed out that he may have committed errors ( the question of " scien ? tific truth " is irrelevant to his work , any ? way ) ; he pointed out his past contribu ? tions to the Soviet Union and his capacity to be of further usefulness to it ; and he frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death , hoping that such an extreme meas ? ure would not be deemed necessary . STRANGELY ENOUGH , the " Pasternak affair " did not really get underway until the Nobel announcement . The cita ? tion , for " his important achievement both in contemporary lyrical poetry and in the field of the great Russian epic tradition , " is about as diplomatic about the inclusion of Doctor Zhivago among Pasternak 's merits as can be ? a fact that was dwelled on with more zeal than dis ? cretion by Dr. Anders Oesterling , per ? manent secretary of the Academy , in a broadcast of the same day . In the same broadcast , according to the New York Times , Dr. Oesterling not only hailed Doctor Zhivago 's " pure and powerful genius , " but also paid tribute to the cour ? age of the author in writing , as a Soviet citizen , a work of such independence . The immediate Soviet reaction was on the quiet side . A direct inquiry elicited a reply from the Soviet Minister of Cul ? ture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prize " now , so many years after the best of his poems had been published . " But within hours , whether or not moved by the tenor of Western comment , the award was called a Cold War trick , and an attack against Pasternak was launched . Of course the fact that the attack could appear in the Soviet press and that it could be pronounced from a speaker 's platform in the presence of Soviet gov ? ernment officials indicates its tacit en ? dorsement by the government . But second thoughts on the Russian reaction offer some interesting insights . THE Soviet public is not entirely un- acquainted with Doctor Zhivago . Ex ? cerpts from it were published in the USSR in 1956 . In that year , too , the decision had been reached not to pub ? lish the work in its entirety , in spite of Pasternak 's announced willingness to make any changes and/or omissions that would make the work acceptable for publication . A letter from the Writers Union signed by Konstantin Fedin , Kon ? stantin Simonov , Boris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lished new in Novy Mir ) explained that the book should not be published in the Soviet Union because it was " immoral " in essence , " deeply unjust , not objective historically , " and " deeply anti-democra ? tic and alien to any kind of understand ? ing of the interests of the people . " Pasternak 's acceptance of the Nobel Prize for this work thus would appear to them the unsavory act they profess to see in it . This conclusion seems to be sup ? ported by the fact that Pasternak is by no means the only Soviet writer non-ad ? jLzsted to the Soviet society . For example , Evgeny Evtushenko , the most talented of young Russian poets , and the novelist Leonid Leonov , are two authors whose works show the same basic attitude to ? ward Soviet society that Pasternak ex ? presses . Nevertheless , the works of both are being published , in books and in leading Soviet literary magazines  --  in ? cluding the very magazines that periodi ? cally blast them for the " decadence , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been held so far to assess their political guilt . The action of the Union of Writers , expelling Pasternak from the union and stripping him of the honorific title of Soviet writer for activities " in ? compatible with the name of Soviet writer , " thus seems to be the product of joint East-West stupidity . The hand of the Soviet government is also seen behind the various public meetings in which the good Soviet citi ? zens who had never had a chance to read Doctor Zhivago for themselves screamed for Pasternak 's banishment . But it is really not so strange that the Soviet citizen should rise against the author of Doctor Zhivago without being bothered that he did not see the book , upon the simple assurance of his government ( given tacitly by publication of the con ? demnation of the book by other writers in the government press ) that it attacks , and he threatens , the Soviet society . In fact , it is to be expected . There is , psychologically , no qualitative difference between the Soviet citizen 's attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pasternak 's novel : he has seen neither ; he can verify his government 's reports on neither ; he believes the one as he does the other . Americans visiting all parts of Russia report being met everywhere with the reproachful question of why the United States wants to wage war on the Soviet Union , and all agree that this con ? cern is genuine . If after all these years our propagandists have not succeeded in convincing the Soviet public of the peace ? fulness of American goals , they do not stand much chance of convincing them of anything that requires questioning the credibility of their own government . uI ) to the , time of the Nobel award , Doctor Zhivago was primarily a literary affair . The reviewers made it uni ? formly clear that this was not a political book . The award seems to have changed all that . Dr. Oesterling 's comments have been mentioned . In my opinion , they support rather than disprove the allega ? tions that the award might have been unduly influenced by political considera ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , it was hotly repeated and denied the world over . The Vatican pavilion at the Brussels World Fair meanwhile , in line with the Vatican 's long tradition of defending the right of every individual to read what ? ever he pleases , was passing out at its back door copies of a Russian edition of Doctor Zhivago to Soviet visitors . On October 23 Radio Liberation , a private organization broadcasting West ? ern propaganda into the Soviet Union , announced it would begin broadcasting the text of Doctor Zhivago on the fol ? lowing morning . On October 25 the New York Times shifted the news on Pasternak , which it had so far listed under the " Amusements and the Arts " heading in its index , to the " International " category . The occa ? sion was the announcement of the attack on Pasternak in the Literaturnaja Gazeta . ( On October 28 Pasternak was moved back to the " Amusements and the Arts " section . ) By the beginning of November the daily press was ? routinely referring to Doctor Zhivago as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are witnessing one of the absurdities of the Cold War : The Soviet people , well acquainted with Pasternak 's poetry but ignorant of Doctor Zhivago , are tearing Pasternak out of their hearts and the citizens of the free world , most of whom have never heard of Pasternak and his work , celebrate him for what they . view as an act of defiance of the Soviet regime , without worrying much about his book ( which few will prob ? ably read to the end , in spite of the sensational sales ) , or about his poems . Pasternak the great human being and Doctor Zhivago his great human docu ? ment are slowly being whittled down to paper pellets for propagandists .
