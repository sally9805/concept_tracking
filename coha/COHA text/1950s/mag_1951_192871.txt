The French franc was on a bobsled run , and the French government seemed powerless to stop it . It had skidded down to a low of 460 to the dollar . <P> Two weeks ago , Premier Ren Pleven proclaimed austerity for France , and a Slash in imports of U.S. coal , ore and raw materials , in an effort to brake the run . But devaluation rumors had French capital badly scared . <P> Last week , after a five-hour cabinet meeting , Pleven had good news to announce : the U.S. had granted France $600 million emergency aid-$200 million for direct economic aid , $400 million to maintain U.S. troops stationed in France and to equip U.S. armed forces from French industry . <P> France would still have to increase its taxes and cut its public works spending to meet its budget . But the dollar pinch was over , and imports could be resumed . At week 's end the franc was on the upswing : 438 to the dollar .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
