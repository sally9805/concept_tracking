There 's Always a Price Tag ( Inter-mondia Films ; Rank ) is a tasty example of how the French can cook up something out of nothing . This picture contains no more than the usual ingredients of the standard Hollywood thriller-it is based on a mystery novel by James Hadley Chase-but Director Denys de la Patellire has prepared it to the king 's taste . He tells the story of a wealthy drunk ( Peter Van Eyck ) who one day informs the greedy salope ( Michele Morgan ) to whom he is married that he is going to commit suicide in a few minutes . But if he does that , she realizes instantly , she will not be able to collect the 300 million francs for which his life is insured . " You will have only a few hours , " he adds dryly , reading her thoughts , " to disguise my suicide as a murder or an accident . " <P> The wife picks up the challenge , and the rest of the story describes how she almost wins her dirty little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . who seduces the maid ( Jocelyne Mercier ) , who thereupon becomes a pliable witness to all sorts of things she imagines she has seen . In the end it takes some very clever police work by a marvelously grimacious flic ( Bernard Blier ) to bring the criminals to book-but then , come to think of it , what crime have they committed ? <P> Hot Spell ( Hal Wallis ; Paramount ) is a sensitively observed and breathingly real tragedy of family life . Alma Duval ( Shirley Booth ) is a nice , warm , middle-aged body , given to sentiment , running to fat , the kind of woman whose world is bounded by porch and kitchen , husband and kids . She lives in a pleasant , old-fashioned house in a middle-class section of New Orleans , and her man ( Anthony Quinn ) , a virile , still handsome Cajun ( " They always stay young and excitable " ) , runs a successful employment agency . The three children are good-looking and intelligent . The oldest ( Earl Holliman ) is a live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously going to make out . The middle one is a girl ( Shirley MacLaine ) and pretty enough to keep the porch glider occupied almost every night of the week . The youngest ( Clint Kimbrough ) is the serious type , always reading poetry and such , and probably headed for college . <P> As far as the neighbors can see . the Duvals have a happy home , but the neighbors do n't know the rest of it : the husband keeps a girl on the side . Ma knows that something is going on , what with him out every night and coming home high all the time . The kids know , too , but they never let on to Pa , and Ma never really lets on to herself . " If you keep calm , " she likes to say , " everything will turn out for the best . " <P> Family gatherings are generally pretty uncomfortable at the Duvals ' - the night of Pa 's birthday , for instance . Ma bakes him a big cake with 45 candles and gets presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa turns up he 's in a bad mood , and grouches around and says to hurry up supper , he has to go out that night . At table he argues with the girl about her latest beau and gets into the usual back-and-forth with the oldest boy about the business . Finally , it all winds up in a big fight , and Pa insults the daughter 's No. 1 prospect ( Warren Stevens ) and then stomps off to the pool hall with the younger boy , leaving Alma to face another of those long , long evenings alone , fooling around the kitchen , wondering what has gone wrong .
