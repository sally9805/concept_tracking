In the jungly world of music , there is a sort of composers ' elite , whose members are deeply respected but relatively obscure . They are the composers who more often than not will be " discovered " by the public after they die , as was Bela Bartok . They get few performances because a ) they write few works , b ) they are constitutionally unsuited to the rigors of promoting performances , c ) their music sounds forbiddingly difficult , and is twice as difficult to play . A member of this elite in good standing is Manhattan 's Elliott Cook Carter , * who , at 47 , is just coming into his own : a recording of his String Quartet by the Walden Quartet is being released ( by Columbia ) in June ; another of a suite from the music for his ballet The Minotaur , played by Howard Hanson and the Eastman-Rochester Symphony Orchestra , has just been released ( by Mercury ) ; and the Louisville Orchestra this week recorded his imposing new Variations for Orchestra . <P> Skulking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new , are written uncompromisingly in the counterpoint of dissonance and paced by skulking , staggering , swirling rhythms . The Minotaur ( 1946 ) throws listeners into an unnerving , outworldish mood with its first heavy notes , seems to approach every sound with a fresh attitude as the music tumbles along . The Quartet ( 1951 ) , though far less accommodating , manages to achieve a satisfying interplay of tension and repose while carrying a quadrilogue at four different tempos simultaneously . High point is the slow movement , with a serene duo that floats calmly past the violent thrusts of the other two voices . The Variations for Orchestra ( 1955 ) is a big ( 25 minutes ) , brilliant work as rich in detail-but not so grotesque-as a Hieronymus Bosch painting . <P> Carter deliberately concentrates on originality instead of themes or ideas already proved . " You do n't get any money from this profession anyway , " he says in an assertive manner that conflicts with his shy appearance . " You might as well do things that amuse you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music-anywhere from months to years-and simple ideas would bore me before I got through . Anyway , I want to invent something I have n't heard before . " <P> Man Catches Fire . Composer Carter took on his musical studies comparatively late in life , after he became an English major at Harvard in 1926 . Those were the years when Serge Koussevitzky was leading the Boston Symphony through the most radical new music , and Carter caught fire . His first major work was a ballet , Pocahontas , in an advanced idiom ; then came a symphony , a piano sonata ( written on a Guggenheim grant ) , choral works and chamber music . Today he has a backlog of commissions that will keep him busy for another year . <P> Chamber music has been Elliott Carter 's most successful field so far . He tends to mistrust the musical stage because it depends on so many people ( but he yet may write an opera ) , and his orchestral works take too many rehearsals to be much performed . Nevertheless , he has no inclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a well-to-do Manhattan lace importer , he inherited an income , and , in addition , he has made a pleasant discovery : " The music I like to write turns out to be the most popular anyway .
