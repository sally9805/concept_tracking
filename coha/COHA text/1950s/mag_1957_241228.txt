Scientists have had a hard time explaining photosynthesis , the action of chlorophyll , on which plant , animal and human life depends . They knew that chlorophyll by itself has no photosynthetic power . Only when it is contained in extremely small structures found in green leaves can it use the energy of light to release hydrogen from water , the first step in photosynthesis . The orderly pattern of the molecules in these bodies , say Drs . Melvin Calvin and Power B. Sogo of the University of California at Berkeley , is the key to the process . <P> The electron microscope shows that in green leaves the chlorophyll is arranged in flat disks like piles of plates . Biologists suspected that this delicate laminated structure had something to do with photosynthesis , but they could not make sense out of it until Bell Telephone Laboratories invented its solar battery , an electronic device made of thin layers of treated silicon . When sunlight hits the battery , it knocks electrons out of one of the silicon layers . Caught by another silicon layer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this principle , Dr. Calvin and other scientists speculated that the thin layers of chlorophyll might capture light energy in somewhat the same way . <P> To prove the theory . Researcher Calvin spelled out a delicate test : searching for free electrons in laminated chlorophyll exposed to sunlight . B. Commoner , J. J. Heise and J. Townsend of Washington University at St. Louis were the first to offer evidence that such electrons exist , but critics did not accept their experiment as conclusive . It was performed at room temperature , and under such conditions many chemical processes having nothing to do with photosynthesis can produce free electrons . <P> To meet this objection , Drs . Calvin and Sogo cooled their apparatus down to - 140C. , close to the temperature of liquid air , so that electron-yielding chemical reactions could not happen . Then they placed deep-frozen chlorophyll in a magnetic field and shot extremely high-frequency radio waves through it . When strong light was shone on the chlorophyll , some of the radio energy was absorbed . This proved to Dr. Calvin that chlorophyll exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light energy by the layer-to-layer method . Nature 's green plants . Dr. Calvin believes , have turned out to be electronic solar batteries invented millions of years before human scientists ever thought of electronics .
