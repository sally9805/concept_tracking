A Sleep of Prisoners ( by Christopher Fry ; produced by Luther Greene ) is staged in the U.S. , as it was in England , in a church ( TIME , May 28 ) . The setting and the resonant acoustics of Manhattan 's St. James ' Church are well suited to Playwright Fry 's religious allegory ; the actors ( three of them from the original British cast ) have mastered that rare trick of speaking poetry as though they meant it . But the play itself is another of those allegorical wastelands and wildernesses that the life of the times has imposed upon its literature . <P> Fry 's own symbol is a prison : his characters , actual prisoners of war housed in a church , are hardly less prisoners of self-of their own fears , guilts , aggressions . Even among themselves there is dissension : the play has hardly begun before hot-tempered Private David King is at cynical Private Peter Abie 's throat . Then the men settle down for the night , and each in succession has a Biblical dream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Meadows , submissive , uninvolved and the oldest of the four prisoners , dreams of Cain and Abel-the general human spectacle of brother murdering brother . But violent David King in his dream is King David clashing with Absalom ; and scoffing , self-pitying Peter Able is Isaac being led to slaughter . Finally Corporal Adams , the responsible man seeking light and truth , sees David , Peter and himself as Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego , all cast into the fiery furnace , all sharing-and surviving-a fearful ordeal : <P> Strange how we trust the powers that <P> ruin , And not the powers that bless . <P> <P> And Meadows , in the dream , answers : <P> Good . . . <P> Grows , and makes , and bravely Persuades , beyond all tilt of wrong : Stronger than anger , wiser than strategy . . . <P> A Sleep of Prisoners is more austere than anything Fry has written ; an inquiry into-and seemingly away from-spiritual desolation . But it lacks the strong simple current , the climactic movement , of religious and dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of a Langland or a Bunyan . For one thing , each dream is really a self-enclosed characterization , so that the play has no organic development . By putting Adams ' affirmative dream last , Fry allows it to point his moral , but not in dramatic terms : it is either Adams talking to himself , or Fry talking to the audience . <P> Fry 's method is as difficult as his meaning . Readers of Fry 's play have time to wrestle with both , but audiences do not . The play 's shifting focus makes for a confusing psychological kaleidoscope rather than any clear philosophic light . And even at its soberest , Fry 's seems a gift better suited to violin cadenzas than sustained organ music , to ladies who , in the end , are not for burning than to men actually thrust into the fiery furnace .
