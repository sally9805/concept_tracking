A bare hour and a half before the horses went to the post , the golden Santa Anita Handicap turned to dross last Saturday when California 's four-legged favorite son was scratched and a sticky homestretch all but ruled out the probability of a last-minute winning home run by Social Outcast . The defection of Swaps and the uncooperativeness of the track surface had the effect of bequeathing the race to a pack of inferior horses , much to the audible dismay of 62,500 fans , the largest Santa Anita Handicap crowd since Citation and Noor contested in 1950. // The race was won by a graduate sprinter with the unhorsey name of Bobby Brocato , a 5-year-old who ate Swaps 's dust on a dry track only a week before . Actually , the race was over a few jumps from the starting gate . A no-chance 4-year-old who was to be 17 lengths behind the entire field at the finish , Golden Land , leaped into the lead but wilted instantly as Jockey Johnny Longden deftly guided Bobby Brocato to the front . // Bobby Brocato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seven-furlong front-runner otherwise ( he did beat High Gun in a sprint once ) , could thank the elements and Longden for his $97,900 win . Raced five times already this meet , he was expected to be stale until his kind of track came up . The heavy midweek rains which washed Swaps out of the race and Social Outcast out of a chance made the gaudy golden gallop a common breeze for him . His margin  --  six lengths  --  was the widest in the handicap 's history . // If Bobby Brocato came out of the gate as though his tail were on fire , Old Sosh came out as though he were half-a-mind to return for something he had left behind . As it turned out , he might as well have . He was dead last  --  the adjective is well taken  --  all the way to the far turn . He went from 10th to seventh in the last quarter mile , but his stretch run was an untypical slog through virtual molasses . // Meanwhile , Longden was holding his horse together handily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who pulled up lame , Turk 's Delight , was second , which gives some idea of the bankruptcy of the race as an improver of the breed . Traffic Judge , the only horse other than Old Sosh with a national reputation , failed to live up to it , gasping in 2 ? lengths behind Social Outcast . // The most interesting matter of fact about Bobby Brocato was the cast of characters in the winner 's circle with him . His owner is the Oklahoma-oil-rich Travis M. Kerr , whose brother is the Oklahoma Senator Robert Kerr . Senator Bob was also on hand for the festivities and probably the votes . // Bobby Brocato was named for the son of the New Orleans restaurateur , Diamond Jim Moran ( n ? Brocato ) , who lives up to his nickname by wearing diamond-studded teeth and eyeglasses . The horse 's breeder is a Las Vegas gambler named Joe W. Brown who keeps a million dollars in cold cash in the window of his Vegas slot-machine saloon . The horse was bought , with three others , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge crowd , Bobby Brocato 's leisurely win was a stale biscuit after a week in which the racing appetite was on edge for a proxy meeting between Swaps and Nashua . Social Outcast , who came within a jump of catching Nashua in the Widener last week , was to be the common denominator by which to gauge the difference between the great rivals . Coming onto a swampy track fresh from a Florida-to-California airplane ride , the Vanderbilt gelding was less a common denominator than a common also-ran . // The California weather spoiled more than a good horse race . It may have spoiled the resolution of the liveliest racing argument in the history of the sport , i.e. , is Nashua better than Swaps , or vice versa ? Swaps 's trainer , Mish Tenney , went through the motions of entering his horse right up to race time , even to putting the mud stickers on his chestnut colt . But he had fair-warned the track and public the night before that Swaps , short on condition , would not take on a track which saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate sinking hock-deep in the mucilage. // What the racing public was hoping for was that Swaps would run and win Saturday , then ship to Florida to challenge Nashua in the Gulfstream Park Handicap on March 17 . Trainer Tenney and Owner Rex Ellsworth left the hope alive but breathing with obvious difficulty after they had scratched their horse . // Shipment to Florida of the Ellsworth string is still dependent on the showing of their 3-year-olds in this week 's Santa Anita Derby . As uneven as the rest of the derby candidates in the barns at Santa Anita this winter , they are a ragged lot right now , but one  --  a full brother to Swaps named Like Magic  --  occasionally but not habitually shows a family trait of speed . // " It is too soon yet to say anything definite about Swaps 's future plans , " Ellsworth admitted after the race . One possibility which will depress avid fans of both Swaps and Nashua : Swaps may remain at Santa Anita for the closing-day mile-and-three-quarter feature on the grass track , the San Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Florida  --  or anywhere else for that matter  --  seven days later .
