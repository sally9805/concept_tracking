" How do you like our weather ? " a British newsman piped up as flashbulbs popped and dignitaries shook hands . Replied Vice President Richard Nixon , who with Wife Pat had arrived in London in a foul fog on a four-day good-will trip to Britain : " We have fog in San Francisco and smog in Los Angeles , so it 's a lot like California weather . " At once London 's Daily Mail reported that Nixon had " managed to make everyone feel that he would have been deeply disappointed if it had been a clear day . " <P> Technically speaking , Nixon was visiting London as the President 's representative at the dedication of a memorial chapel in St. Paul 's Cathedral to 28,000 U.S. World War II dead . But before he arrived , a disdainful British press made clear its conviction that the Vice President , while welcome as U.S. emissary , was not likely to make a personal hit . <P> " Plastic politician , " said London 's Observer ; " Organization man , " said the News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the London Daily Mirror ; " Mechanical smile , " said the Daily Herald ; " Superb political gamesmanship , " said the Manchester Guardian . In one of the odd situations of modern diplomacy , Nixon was personally on trial and double-dared to make a misstep . <P> " Our English Heritage . " Without changing clothes , he sped off from the welcoming ceremonies in Victoria Station to address a luncheon meeting of the upper-crust Pilgrims Society at the Savoy , got a nice introduction from the Pilgrims ' Toastmaster Lord Birkett as " a product of that great American tradition that the village boy can rise to high office , and has invested the office of Vice President with higher importance and greater prestige than it has ever enjoyed . " Nixon in turn made his tribute to Britain : " Every time an American citizen acts politically within the democratic context , we reflect our English heritage . " That said , he turned to a basic principle of the Anglo-American alliance-collective security-that is popular in Britain , and pointedly applied it to a crisis that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " could render no greater disservice to the cause of peace than to fail to stand firm as we have in the Formosa Strait against the use of aggressive force . " <P> Nixon 's first gain : warm applause from the Pilgrims , a stilling of press criticism down to Beaverbrook press notes about his " Hollywood-style G-men " ( he had two Secret Service men with him ) , about the " 22-ft. " length of his Cadillac.
