In a dense papyrus swamp 50 miles from Nairobi last week , the Mau Mau were making what the British hoped was their last stand . Sixty terrorists were trapped , including several members of the hierarchy which has directed the four-year war against their fellow Kikuyu tribesmen and their white employers . With an estimated 3,000 Mau Mau at large in scattered groups , the British felt that " the emergency " was almost ended . <P> Since 1952 , some 14,000 Mau Mau have been killed , captured , or have surrendered . Another 62,000 suspects , held in prisons and concentration camps , are being cleared and rehabilitated at the rate of 1,000 a month . Nearly a million <P> Kikuyu are no longer living in huts scattered through the reserves , and thus vulnerable to Mau Mau threats , but have been brought together into 850 villages , all policed and protected at night . On the fairway of No. 3 hole at Nyeri Golf Club , the square black tent which housed the gallows from which scores of Mau Mau were hanged has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of several massacres , a horticultural show was recently held . Life , it seemed , was back to normal . The Multiple Vote . But the shadow of the Mau Mau panga has left Kenya in a thoughtful mood . The idea that Africans should take part in the government of the country , laughed at three years ago , is now being seriously discussed . Negroes , constituting 97% of Kenya 's 5,900,000 population , are represented on the existing 56-member Legislative Council by six Africans appointed by the colonial governor . Under new recommendations made by the British Colonial Office and the Kenya government , these six members would henceforth be elected by direct secret ballot . <P> The enfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of illiterate tribesmen has its problems . Kenya 's Minister for Education , Labor and Lands , Walter Fleming Coutts , appointed to study possible electoral systems , last week proposed multiple voting ( an idea that Coutts had read about in Novelist Nevil Shute 's satirical In the Wet ) , by which each voter will have voting points varying according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has finished high school , has served five years in the armed services , and been decorated , he can earn up to six votes . Coutts 's proposals came under attack in England as discriminatory democracy , but they also won praise as an attempt to bridge the obvious difficulties and dangers in giving the vote to unschooled tribesmen . Their most important feature was conferring the secret ballot on individuals rather than relying on headmen to vote for all their people . <P> Numbered Days . The big question in the minds of Kenya 's white settlers is : In multiracial government , when do you stop ? Certainly not at a mere six African members in the legislature , say many white men , who feel that they have perhaps five years ' grace in which to guide Kenya 's future along peaceful channels . Moderate blacks , peacefully agitating , may be a stickier problem than the Mau Mau . No longer able to jail Africans for " seditious " talk about political rights , the white settler gulps hard and smiles wanly . He knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
