In the summer of 1944 , things began to pile up on Private Karl Schleicher of Adolf Hitler 's Wehrmacht . German army medicine was ready and able to treat his wounded thigh after a Russian bullet had creased it , but the German supply system was not up to replacing his torn pants . Private Schleicher , turned down by his sergeant , pinched a pair for himself from the quartermaster 's store , and went into battle again . In the midst of the fray he lost his unit , got back to it a week later , just in time to be arrested for pants-stealing . To make a good trial , a new charge was added : desertion . Private Schleicher , duly court-martialed , was resigned to getting five years in prison , when the Russians stepped in , shipped him off to Siberia . <P> Cold and hungry on a diet of cabbage and barley , Schleicher fended for himself once again , and was caught stealing a handful of potatoes .

Schleicher got back to Germany in 1948 to find that his wife had remarried and that he was officially dead . He retired to another hospital to have his leg amputated . <P> Resigned to misery , he came out 18 months later , determined to give his wife a divorce . But first , said the lawyers , he must be officially brought to life again . They dug up old records . They pored over the past . What was this ? An unserved sentence for pants-stealing ? A Hamburg court investigated , and sentenced Schleicher to five months ' imprisonment for his forgotten crime . Schleicher appealed . A higher court cut the sentence to one month . Schleicher threw himself into a Hamburg pond , determined to end it all . Even at this he failed . A passing couple saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the Hamburg city council took pity on Private Schleicher , and passed a special legislative act granting him full pardon for everything . But bitterness had entered the sack 's sad soul . " I 'm going to spend my life , " he swore , " fighting the stupid red tape which is entangling every German . "
