 | and quiet Ensign Bud Foster , son of a Kansas farmer . Sherwood went into the chart room to prepare the zigzag plan . Kruger was sent out on a routine check of weather decks . Foster stood beside the bridge messenger on the port wing of the blacked-out bridge . In the shadows were enlisted men , boatswain 's mate of the watch , quartermaster , two helmsmen , and there were fourteen lookouts : enough men on one bridge watch to run a small ship . Nothing to do , just stars and sea ? no enemy , no invasion fleet crowded all about . These things were to come , and when they did , he would be thankful for this period of quiet organization . At last Gedney seemed satisfied and retired to his sea cabin , a room barely large enough for bunk , chair and wash basin , where the captain could be quickly reached in an emergency . " I will lie down with my clothes on , MacDougall . The light bulbs are unscrewed , the porthole is open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time . I will be awake ; I will just close my eyes . " When the sea-cabin door closed after Gedney , MacDougall sighed with relief . " After commanding a ship of my own , " he said to Sherwood on the opposite bridge wing , " I can appreciate his sense of responsibility , but it 's very annoying to have captains hanging around the bridge in the middle of the night when there is nothing for them to do . " " I 'd think you 'd feel better with the captain around . " " Not when you know ships . They can seem almost human . I like to be alone on a bridge at night ; a skipper hanging around steals some of the feeling I like to share with my ship . " " You are a romantic lad , " said Sherwood . MacDougall laughed out loud . This Sherwood tickled him  --  such al fatherly attitude when he was at least seven years younger . " Was , . perhaps , " he said . " Things are changed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the chart room and MacDougall stood alone now on the starboard wing , unmindful of men crowded into , bridge shadows , his feet apart to get the sensation of his new ship's. movements . New , she was , new but alive . He listened to wind in the top hamper and sea wash curling along the waterline , wondering what hostile shores they would visit and what action they would share .. Macl ) ougall 's thoughts went back to the first time he saw the Belinda : the night before her launching . . . that old man saying , " Ships talk . " Tonight , as the salt wash pressed against the Belinda 's bilge keels , she would be talking more , working out in this seaway all remaining locked-in stresses which would come free as long as her-  | hull remained intact . While MacDougall gripped the bridge railing and felt the ship 's vibrations he heard the words of the old shipbuilder whispering through the windswept rigging : " A good ship , a fortunate ship . " After one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active duty in the Navy , which involved removing two of the four gold stripes around the sleeves of his blues , and a cut in his income to less than one half of what it had been . Yet one thing had been added : the thrill running up and down his spine now that he was really on his country 's team . MacDougall remembered the next time he saw the Belinda , on the morning of her sailing from the outfitting yard for this first passage and shakedown of ship and crew . Walking past a group of storage sheds , MacDougall had suddenly felt salt air whispering in from sea as he came upon a mooring slip . On the side nearest to him lay a neglected looking four-masted bark , stripped of her sails , white paint feeling from wooden hull , standing rigging hanging in slack bights , a martingale stay dangling from her bowsprit into tidewater which curled about her forefoot . Across from the bark loomed a much larger hull , freshly painted war-gray , her bridge deck higher than the squarerigger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great wooden wheel on the bark 's deserted poop . MacDougall rounded the sailing ship and glanced up at the Naval identification painted iu white lettering six feet high on the Belinda 's cruiser stern : PA 15 . That stood for Attack Transport Number Fifteen , one of the first of a comparatively new type of combat ship , designed to land assault troops on enemy beachheads using her own landing craft . MacDougall looked up at these assault boats , nested on hatches or hanging overside from davits . They dominated the ship more than her guns or her radar antenna , which rotated one hundred and twentyfive feet above her waterline . Speaking to his officers gathered in the shipyard briefing room the day before , the Belinda 's commanding officer , silver-haired Captain Winthrop Gedney , Annapolis , Class of 1908 , had said : " An attack transport 's main battery is not her guns ; an attack transport 's main battery is her boats . The entire mission of the Belinda is to carry a combat-loaded battalion landing team of some fourteen hundred officers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary equipment , as it were in the laps of the enemy . " Gedney had paused , smiling faintly as he dabbed at his tidy blues with a clean handkerchief . ' " An attack transport is the largest of all amphibious types . You  | might call her a beachhead lady . What she becomes will depend largely on you officers . You may make her a home , or if you so prefer , you may make her a madhouse and I will help you . " MacDougall 's feelings as he looked up from dockside at the Belinda and her landing craft were less sweeping , more personal . He had been assigned duty as boat group commander , his responsibility to train boat crews and to guide these landing craft to shore in organized waves . There was much to be done before these boats , with their hinged ramps and sturdy diesel engines , were ready to carry the war to Japanese waiting on Micronesian islands . MacDougall glanced at white draft marks painted next the rudder post : the Belinda was drawing only eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was familiar with the ship 's characteristics , having commanded a similar type of hull in the merchant service . With all the Belinda 's additional top hamper of guns , three hundred and forty tons of landing craft together with six sets of heavy davits , innumerable gun mounts and additions to steel deckhouses on several levels , she was bound to be cranky . Requests for additional ballast had been denied , pending the shakedown cruise to Hawaii . Most of the crew were green , and the ship was far from being properly secured for sea . That deserted old windjammer across the slip with her rigging hanging in bights was about as ready for sea as this newly commissioned ship of the United States Navy , due to sail within the hour . MacDougall looked up again at the wall of gray paint , thirty feet above him to main deck , eight feet more for each additional deck pyramided above ? upper deck , boat deck , bridge deck and signal bridge . He noted rolled up debarkation nets , secured to bulwarks fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these dropped to water 's edge and shorebound infantrymen would clamber to boats waiting beneath . In his imagination he saw not khakiclad men in helmets , but the white-capped sailors now climbing shore brow to quarterdeck scrambling down these nets from a sinking ship . Weather decks were crowded with sailors coming out scuttles from below-deck compartments for final muster before sailing . The last of the liberty section continued to climb the brow and step aboard , some dutifully , some proudly saluting colors and quarterdeck . MacDougall walked through the crowd and continued forward along the five-hundred-sixteen feet of the Belinda 's length , and looked up at her bow , some twenty feet higher than the fantail aft . There was her starboard anchor , a three-ton affair which , being of different manufacture from the hawse , did not fit properly . Seen from the pier the  | anchor appeared incredibly high , yet soon it would be plunging up and down in the sea and if not secure , would soon work loose . iMacl ) ougall caught a glimpse of the warrant boatswain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpenter and warrant electrician . I would n't be surprised if the anchor winch was haywire , MacDougall thought . Nine-inch mooring lines surged alternately taut and slack ; the ship was stirring at her moorings as if restless to get to sea . Engines must be warming up , propeller turning ahead and astern ; it was time to get aboard . MacDougall swung on his heel and headed for the brow , dull ache inside for Nadine , his wife , and Robbie , his two-year-old son . As a sort of anesthesia to heart pain , his mind ground out lines of an old slaver 's ditty , ending : And then we put the hatches on . It was time for us to go . Chapter 4 WEATHER continued moderate , warming pleasantly as the Belinda approached the Hawaiian Islands . While the ship worked out her stresses , Gedney trained his crew intensively . Sunrise and sunset battle stations became familiar routine , daily drills exercised them in carrying out the ship 's intended tactical duties and to cope with emergencies sure to occur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas attack drill , abandon ship drill : day or night any one or more of these drills with attending problems in damage control were announced without previous warning . In one of many such alerts , PA speakers roused sleepers at one in the morning with : " Fire in combat gasoline stowage at frame one-four-six , second platform , number five hold . Watertight bulkhead at frame one-four-one ruptured . Damage control party number three , proceed to scene of the fire ; all others proceed to fire quarters and stand fast . " Bomb hits , engine failures , casualties to personnel , crashed bulkheads ? hour after hour Gedney confronted his officers and men with simulated disasters , then watched them critically and held critiques on his bridge . After his chastened officers left , he sat in his high seat pondering over what had been done ; thinking up new surprises to be suddenly announced by  | the authoritative voice of the ship 's PA . Later , in surf-whipped Oahu and Maui bays , he would exercise his crew at the all important shipto-shore movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Routine gradually wore into all hands until bewildering situations and commands became familiar , if not completely understood . One night , after a week at sea , a canvas target set up on a raft was dropped over the side . The Belinda turned and steamed back and forth on runs passing within three thousand yards of the raft . Star shells fired from Gun One illuminated the bobbing target with eerie , palegreen light . At Gedney 's order , firing runs were made . The crew was stimulated by the sharp barking of five-inch guns , coughing rhythm of twin forties and rapid shock of automatic twenties as Gedney closed upon the target . When it was hoisted aboard , splintered and filled with holes , most of the crew felt confident that they could handle all corners . " Let us at them Japs , " cried Ned Strange , a loader at Gun Two . " We 'll do the same to them ! " On the tenth morning , off Makapuu Head , the Belinda was met by a low-flying B-26 , painted bright yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a canvas target sleeve about fifteeen feet long , painted bright red . Weighted down with helmet , life jacket , sun glasses and binoculars , Gedney took station on the bridge wing and called all hands to battle stations . After giving specific instructions regarding angles of fire so as to hit the towed sleeve without endangering the tow plane , he said to alert little Art Hall , the gunnery officer , " Now get back to your control station and do n't forget to lead the target . " " Aye , aye , sir , " said Hall , holding his five-feet-six inches erect , " We 'll punch that target full of holes , Captain . " The first run was horizontal , plane and target crossing ahead of the ship at about four thousand feet altitude . As the target crossed dead ahead , Gedney cried , " Gun One . Commence firing . " His order went into the phone circuits . Almost instantly the long-barreled gun on the forecastle roared and recoiled . Again it fired , then eight more shots cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each burst of exploding powder lagged further behind the target . " Tell Lieutenant I Tall to have his men lead the target , " said Gedney to his talker . Next came a similar run , only astern for Gun Two . In spite of warnings and careful instructions , the sleeve passed by unscathed . Tall  | Roy Alvick , gun captain at Gun Two , flushed red with anger and turned back from his position over the gun 's breech to plead with MacDougall , his battery officer , " Let me point this gun , sir , with Doyle from Gun Three to train . We can knock that sock full of holes on the next run . " " No , " said MacDougall sharply , " I know that you old-timers can shoot ; the problem is to train these kids . " " But let us show ' em , sir . Just once . " " No . It is n't today that matters . What matters is teaching these men to hit Jap planes . They saw experts hitting targets at Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to them now . " The target plane made glide runs for the anti-aircraft forties . After a few fitful explosions , these guns jammed at the breeches from improper loading and could no longer be fired . The tow plane came still closer to give twenty millimeter batteries a chance . As they burst into eager fire , the ship trembled , yet although the forward trajectory of tracer bullets seemed in line with the target , they swept backward from the speeding sleeve like water sprayed from so many hoses , and no hits were registered . As if encouraged by this miserable performance , the target plane flew some distance astern , then turned and came along the ship 's port hand , passing close aboard and flying at masthead height . The bright red sleeve , rippling in the slipstream , seemed to be thumbing its derision at frustrated gun crews . Here was their chance ! While the Belinda shuddered from truck to keel , every gun which could be brought to bear poured out a withering blast of fire , yet not one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane retrieved its undamaged sleeve and returned to base , Gedney snapped on all groups of the PA system and said to his crew , " I thank God that we were attacked by fifteen feet of can-vas ! " The litter of empty shell casings had been gathered up and stowed below . Decks had been washed down and the ship tidied for entrance into port . Waikiki Beach with its pink and white hotels lay abeam in a setting of coconut trees . Dead ahead , the flat , unimpressive entrance to Pearl Harbor was in sight . All hands had been called to quarters and division officers mustered on the bridge , waiting to receive orders for the day from the executive officer . Quigley stood beside Gedney 's pilothouse chair . Despite the negative showing at gunnery practice , the captain seemed in excellent humor as he smiled and said in a pleasant tone , " The uniform for entering port will be  | service dress whites for officers and undress whites with neckerchief for the crew . " " Aye , aye , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , passing on the captain 's order in an equally pleasant voice . The officers began at once to protest and to make excuses . " I left my whites in ' Frisco : thought we were going out to fight . " " Mine are crumpled in the bottom of a sea bag . That 's where they belong for the duration . " " How about the line handlers ? They 'll be black before we get alongside . " Quigley waited calmly until silence was restored , then said pleasantly , " I repeat , gentlemen , uniform for entering port will be whites . I ca n't understand your objections ; personally , I think it will look smart . Regardless what you may think about it , I am passing on an order from the captain . When the word is passed , all the crew not actually working the ship will be mustered on the main deck , by divisions , wearing whites . All officers will wear whites . All line handlers will wear whites . Is that clear ? " Hearing no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Post . " Thus dismissed , the officers returned to their divisions . Curling breakers washed white reefs to port and starboard as the Belinda steamed carefully through green channel waters , entering Pearl Harbor . Her crew lined the rail two deep , facing outboard , their snowy whites sharply contrasting with battle-gray of decks and landing craft . At bow and stern , the boatswain and MacDougall , in crumpled whites , supervised breaking out of heavy mooring lines and wires by sailors reluctant to soil white trousers which they had carefully washed and pressed for liberty ashore . On the bridge , Gedney , dressed in perfectly fitting whites , beautifully laundered by his Chinese steward and decorated with three rows of multicolored service ribbons , looked down upon his crew with satisfaction . " Just what I wanted , " he remarked to Quigley , who hovered at his elbow . " At least they look like sailors . " Randall , who had the deck , kept a close eye on the channel . The Naval harbor pilot who had come aboard was newly assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of outbound ISTs wallowed down upon the Belinda . To squeeze past them it became necessary to sheer to starboard , which was done just in time . Randall ran to the starboard wing and looked down . The Belinda was about to sideswipe a flotilla of mine sweepers moored  | alongside the channel . " Pilot , " he called . " We 'd better come left again . " " I ca n't , " said the pilot . " These ribbon-clerk skippers are crowding the . " " You 'll have to come left  --  push ' em over , " said Randall striding towards the pilot . " We 're going to crash into ? " Randall 's sentence was never finished . Gedney 's arm reached across his chest and stopped him abruptly . " Mr. Randall , " said Gedney in a voice trembling with anger , " look at this ! " He grasped Randall by the arm and pointed a finger towards the foredeck . Just forward of the bridge , two fifty-six-foot steel tank lighters were cradled upon numIher three hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dungarees , which were rolled halfway to his knees , sat comfortably in their shade on the edge of the hatch , enjoying the scenery . Black hair , badly in need of cutting , flopped over his eyes . He was apparently humming a tune , for he seemed to be keeping time with one of his dirty bare feet against the covered firemain which ran alongside the hatch . Indifferent to regimentation about him , he was whittling a stick with a murderous-looking jackknife . Gedney was reduced to a hoarse whisper . " Randall , you are the officer of the deck . Go down and place that man under arrest . Bring him up here to me . " Randall looked at Gedney in astonishment . Was it possible that the captain wished him to leave the bridge in a crowded , narrow channel to arrest a man for whittling a stick ? The expression on Gedney 's face convinced him that this was indeed the case . Randall turned and went down the ladder with Gedney 's shocked voice following him : " What will Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creased trousers approaching : just let a body be comfortable and along comes an officer . He looked up at Randall , who was saying , " The captain wants to see you , up on the bridge . " " Oh , that 's right nice of him . I never been up there . " Before the morning 's over you 'll wish you never had , thought Randall . Aloud he said , " Better leave your stick down here . " When they reached the bridge , Gedney was concentrating on the piloting and seemed to have forgotten all about the barefoot whittler . " I have n't time for him now . Ca n't you see I 'm busy ? " He gesticulated towards the after part of the bridge wing . " Have him stand there ' ti1 I have time for him . " Nevertheless , Gedney seemed to relax again . Leaving Randall to work with the pilot , he drew off a bit with Quigley and lapsed into reminiscence . " It 's nice to enter port  | once more with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admiral 's pie . " " Pie , sir ? " " I was first lieutenant in the battleship Colorado . We were standing in to San Pedro after summer maneuvers . We were the flag : old Admiral Brash . You 've heard of him , have n't you ? " " Oh yes , sir . Great on spit and polish . " " Indeed he was ! The admiral had given strict orders that every man in the fleet should be mustered at quarters . The captain sent me about decks to see that the flagship complied . Every last man , ' he said . Whom should I bump into on the quarterdeck but the admiral 's steward , carrying a large lemon pie . " Quigley smiled . " I suppose you captured the pie , sir . " " No , indeed . The construction and repair people were mustered nearby and I put the steward in the front rank , next to the boilermaker striker . Of course he tried to wriggle out of it  --  you know how impertinent admiral 's stewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered this pie . ' " I said , Was it a direct order ? ' He could not answer that . I had him there . I said , When all hands secure from quarters , you may tell the admiral that the ship 's first lieutenant found you crossing the quarterdeck with a pie and placed you in ranks . ' " " Anything ever come of it , sir ? " " Nothing official ; I knew my regulations . But for years after I was known throughout the fleet as the only officer who had ever mustered an admiral 's pie at quarters . " When the Belinda had been securely moored , Gedney spun around on his heel and walked over to the barefoot nonconformist from the foredeck . Now he 's going to get it , thought Randall . Dirty as a pig and no hat ! The Old Man will fry him for sure ! " Well , son , " said Gedney , still enjoying recollections of the admiral 's pie , " What 's your name and division ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee , yes , but what division on the Belinda ? What are your duties ? " " First division ; I 'm the garbage grinder , " Hubert said proudly . " I see , but you should keep cleaner , " said Gedney . " Oh , I keep that place clean , Cap'n . You should come down sometime and see for yourself . Only trouble is the chicken guts . " " Chicken guts ! "  | " They jam up them gears . I keep telling them cooks about the chicken guts . And them mess cooks , leavin ' forks in the garbage . You would n't believe it ? why , just this morning ? " " Yes indeed , " Gedney raised a hand to put a stop to the garbage grinder 's monologue . Then he turned to Randall . " See that this man gets cleaned up and into the prescribed uniform of the day . " As Gedney headed down ladder for his cabin , Randall heard him muttering , " Chicken guts . Chicken guts , indeed ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat as it bounced in the chop alongside the Belinda , MacDougall anxiously watched the first attempt at hoisting out boats . Just before he had scrambled into the boat , Gedney had said , " I expect that this will take you a little over half an hour the first time or two . " That had been an hour and seventeen minutes ago , and exactly nine of the Belinda 's thirty-two landing craft were in the water . The rest still waited in chocks on deck , hung precariously from heavy framed arms of gravity-launching davits or dangled from cargo boom yardarms . Sunshine shimmered from the curving white beach line of Kaneohe Bay where MacDougall was scheduled to conduct the first practice landing of Belinda 's boat group . Mountain peaks flanking Nuuanu Pali appeared to float in summer haze while trade winds blew unchanging against Oahu 's windward shore . The very air had the feeling of leisure , of languid resistance to change and sudden effort . Somehow , MacDougall knew , he must overcome this ; the Belinda 's first assault landing against Jap-held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to train this boat group . " Look at that VP , sir ! " Al Hatcher , command boat coxswain , pointed aft . " Trouble ! " MacDougall turned his head left . A thirty-six foot ramp boat swung and jerked at the ends of the heavy mechanical davit , which was slamming back and forth like two tremendous waving arms . These davit crews : would they ever learn ? " Goose her over there , " MacDougall ordered . The two-hundred-fifty horse power engine roared ; the command boat picked up way and swung in an incurving  | arc which brought them quickly within shouting distance of the davit . Hatcher was one of the few experienced landing-craft coxswains aboard . He was a smart and willing mountain boy from Virginia , with surf knowledge gained at Guadalcanal and Attu . As the command boat slowed again , MacDougall cupped his hands and yelled to the davit crew on deck above , " Pull the pin . Pull the strongback pin ! Quit jockeying that davit winch and hold an even strain ' til you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There were shouts on deck . Doyle , a boatswain 's mate second , came on the run to take charge . A sailor bobbed up from within the hung-up craft , pulled the forgotten pin from the strongback center and the LCVP lowered in hesitant surges toward the water fifty feet below . MacDougall turned his attention elsewhere  --  six boats from the starboard side now safe in the water . He wondered how Sherwood was getting along on the other side . " Take her to port , Cox'n , " he ordered . Again Hatcher gunned his boat , cutting around the bow of the drifting Belinda . Sherwood was with Randall in Boat Two , the salvage boat , an LCP with a shovel-nosed hard wooden bow , similar to the command boat except that it had no canopy . It was equipped with special emergency pumps and fire-fighting gear manned by a group of enlisted specialists under Randall , who were prepared to fight fire and to make emergency repairs to landingcraft engines and hulls . Things had gone better on the port side : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat circle ready for calling , while three more were halfway down the Belinda 's side , all on an even keel . With a hasty wave to Sherwood , his assistant boat commander , MacDougall hurried back to the starboard side . Startled yells from the afterdeck brought his attention suddenly to number five hatch , where a ten-ton cargo boom crashed down through a tangle of parted rigging toward the ship 's rail , while at the same time the landing craft which was being lowered overside dropped like a rock the last ten feet and landed in the water with a geyser-like splash . No need to signal Hatcher this time ; the command boat was roaring to the scene . MacDougall realized what had happened : some dockhand had mistaken clutch lever for brake . Now a boar and boom were ruined , no doubt ? perhaps some of the crew badly hurt . All this in bright daylight ! What would happen tonight when he was scheduled to launch these boats in pitch dark ? Passing under the end of the cargo boom , which hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the command boat smartly alongside the dropped craft . MacDougall jumped aboard and looked  | about . The coxswain was doubled over the horizontal steering wheel , gasping for breath . The bow hook was sprawled on the grating , near the ramp . The third member of the dropped boat 's crew seemed unharmed and unconcerned . He sat on top of the large engine box , cushioned by a number of kapok life jackets . The coxswain was getting his breath again . " Are you hurt , son ? " MacDougall asked . " I 'm all right , " the coxswain gasped . " Just that wheel . . . got me in the guts . . . . What happened ? " MacDougall was down inside the craft 's deep well , where combat infantrymen would stand on the trip from ship to shore . He looked all about , not a leak . These boats were tough . The bow hook had a nasty gash over his left ear . MacDougall looked up towards deck . Boatswain Torgeson was looking down at the tangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we can fix it , " he said laconically . " I 'll leave this boat , " said MacDougall . " Looks O.K. but should be checked . Send the crew to sick bay for a check up , just in case . " From the hatch the command boat roared out to the rendezvous circle off the bow , where boats which had managed to reach water were idling in a ragged circle . En route , MacDougall asked Hatcher , " Who was that relaxed character doping off on the life jackets ? " Hatcher grinned . " That 's Sacktime Riley . " " Sacktime ? " " That 's what they call him . Sleeps night and day ? supposed to be a boat engineer but he never moves a muscle if he can help it ? always waits to see if the other guys will do it for him . " Somehow the rest of the boats were lowered into the water without accident . MacDougall rounded up the thirty craft , divided them into five practice waves , each in charge of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather was pleasant ; temperature , sun and breeze were just right . As the boat group drew away from the Belinda he could feel the tension running out of him . It was good to he away and on his own . Aside from his knowledge of boats and surf and his study of the new naval manuals on ship-to-shore movement , he was as green at this stuff as any of his crew . But there was no help to be had from the ship , from Gedney or any of them . This business was something new to the Navy ; they would learn it in white water and on the beaches , not from books or from Gedney 's lectures . He watched the boat waves following him , each a horizontal line of six boats . The first two waves looked good ; that would be Sherwood and Kruger . The others were beginning to straggle astern .  | MacDougall took up his signal flags and ordered them to close up . Gradually third and fourth waves closed up somewhat , but the last one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were spreading further and further apart . There might come times when it would be necessary to spread boats apart to avoid enemy strafing , but first they must learn to act as a team . Soon they would be loaded with a thousand beach-bound soldiers or marines , and the landing would be a matter of minute scheduling . He could never maintain timed waves this way . With a signal to Hatcher , MacDougall turned his boat around , cut throttle and waited for Sherwood 's first wave to come up with him . Sherwood rode the nearest LCVP in the wave , long arms hooked over the ramp top as he watched the rocks about and shoreline ahead . " Lead the way in , Steve , " MacDougall shouted . " I 'm going back after those stragglers . " As the command boat flashed by the third wave on her way seaward , the burly figure of Lieutenant Mike O'Bannion waved to him . Mike was taking his beach party in for orientation . They had the ship 's jeep along to provide simple practice at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded with high frequency voice radio equipment , with which Mike would establish communication with the ship from the beach . The fifth boat wave was very slow to close up . No amount of signaling seemed to do any good . MacDougall cut his boat around and came close alongside the last wave . " What 's the matter , Bud ? " he called to the boat officer . " Why do n't you close up ? That 's what you 're here for . Could n't you see my signal ? " The ensign made no reply . A flow of angry words came to MacDougall 's mind . Then he looked at Bud 's face . It was not a face belonging to anyone who would be unco-operative or stubborn . It was just a kindly young face from somewhere in the middle of Kansas , completely lost in this stuff . MacDougall took a big gulp of fresh air , held it a moment , then exhaled and said , " Open your throttle four hundred revs more , Bud . That will bring you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your boats together . " MacDougall ran the command boat around to the other end of the loose line . " Squeeze ' em over , cox , " he yelled . " They 'll move over . It 's just like herding cows . " Hatcher , who had seen more cows than landing craft , grinned and rode herd on wave five . Hatcher opened throttle on the speedy command boat and soon returned MacDougall alongside Sherwood 's first wave , still in perfect alignment . They had rounded the point and were now deep into the  | Curve of the bay , surf ahead and beyond , white sand washed by fourfoot waves . Long ground-swell rollers lifted the line of boats abreast In unison , then slid on under , leaving them stern down in the trough . " Step her up , " yelled MacDougall . " Ride her in on the back of that wave . " Suddenly they were in white surf boil . MacDougall signaled Sherwood on , then cut his motor and watched the first wave go in for a landing while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interval with the sweep second hand of his strap watch . Sherwood swept his boats in on a roller . Abruptly , bows grounded and ramps dropped down on wet , white sand in a surprising stop to forward motion , denying the illusion given by wave motion that the boats would continue over dry sand until they landed in fragrant lantana shrubs beyond the beach line . No boats broached to . Sherwood 's wave retracted without difficulty and Kruger came in with the second wave for a similar landing . O'Bannion 's beach party was landed without damage to their equipment . MacDougall began to feel better . Perhaps he had been over concerned during the bungled boat launching . His main responsibility was with the boats after they left the ship . He could visualize a thousand marines swarming up the beach , backed up by the ammunition , tanks and guns which his boat group would land . MacDougall 's spine tingled . This job was just right for him ; Harrison could have the navigator 's berth . O'Bannion 's beach party set up canvas beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard symbols for various stockpiles of materiel : gasoline , ammunition , water , provisions , medical supplies and tracked vehicles . Beach limits were vertical and horizontal panels of plain red bunting , which fluttered in the trade wind like great red sails . Assisted by Randall 's salvage boat , the hydrographic party set obstruction buoys to mark rocks and coral shoaling which would endanger boat bottoms at low tide . A signalman stood at the beach line , directing landing craft to proper stockpiles . Ramps dropped , then raised again ; boats backed off the reach to be replaced by others . It seemed to MacDougall that here at last were beginnings of system . " Beach her , Hatcher , " he said . As soon as he felt jolt of sandy beach under solid bow , he jumped ashore and went to look for Mike O'Bannion . O'Bannion had taken an active part in beach party exercises . He worked in the water with his men while they planted buoys and practiced holding the salvage boat from broaching to by means of steadying lines run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold  | her , lads , " he called . " When the surf rolls high , you 'll need to hold her fast , or we 'll be digging channels back to water . " O'Bannion waded ashore . He was soaked to the waist ; better get his pants dry . Removing his trousers , he hung them up to dry on a driftwood snag . His voluminous shorts were plastered wetly against white skin of hairy legs ; his shirttails rippled behind as he turned his attention seaward . There came MacDougall in the command boat . It would soon be time to round up beach party equipment and return aboard the Belinda . Shadows- moved across the sand from O'Bannion 's right . Turning back to shore , he came face to face with two officers in khaki , gold lace on their cap visors . Scrambled eggs  --  must be some brass from Pearl come to check on the Belinda 's first practice landing . Ignoring the absence of his trousers , he stiffened to attention and saluted smartly . They not only returned the salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected such cordiality ; he looked at the devices on their shirt collars : the taller one was a captain in the supply corps ; the stocky one was a medical officer with rank of commander . " Have you had an accident , Lieutenant ? " asked the doctor . O'Bannion looked down at his shorts . " Oh , no , " the doctor hastened to add , " I mean your boat  --  it 's aground , is n't it ? " " All those flags ? " added the supply officer . " Are you signaling for help ? " O'Bannion cleared his throat . It was evident that these staff officers had no connection with the amphibious force . " Gentlemen , " he began . " The ship you see out there on the horizon is an attack transport . In a matter of days she will be lying off an enemy beachhead ? and I 'll be standing on the sands with shot and shell flying all about . " " Indeed ! " exclaimed the doctor . " And what are your duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then exhaled . " I 'm her beachmaster . " " Our staff duties at Pearl  --  medical planning  --  very dull  --  we have n't had opportunity . . . Just what does a beachmaster do ? " O'Bannion looked about the beach , picked up a stick and began to draw a diagram in the sand before the two officers , who had found seats upon a weathered log . In dramatic sentences , he outlined the ship-to-shore movement . " The attack force comes in from deep water , " he said , pointing with his stick , first out to seaward , where the Belinda still lay , then to a spot in his diagram . " Battleships , cruisers , screening destroyers , here , here and here . They pour in  | a cross fire bombardment from both flanks . Now here in the center is the transport area . The attack transports lie here ; each ship hoists out her own invasion craft ; marines swarm down the nets into the boats . " O'Bannion moved his stick a little closer to diagrammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where landing craft from an entire transport division or squadron meet and form up in waves . The position of every boat has been planned , studied and practiced in what we call dry runs . ' " " I do n't see how you do it ! " said the supply officer . " We ca n't see either , " said O'Bannion . " It 's all done in the dark ? most landings . We get into position , hoist out boats , form up ? all in pitch dark . " " What are these lines you 've drawn ? " asked the doctor . " Those are the boat lanes from the line of departure to the beach . " " Line of departure ? " " Yes , that 's what we call it . It is an exact distance off the beach , usually three or four thousand yards . A destroyer or picket boat is used to signal departure of timed waves . Then it is up to boat group commanders and their wave officers to get the boats to the beach at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important ? It seems to me ? " " It has to be synchronized . Battleships bombarding , planes divebombing and strafing ? it all has to be timed so that the assault troops land at the half minute interval between pause in bombardment and Japs getting their heads up again . If the first wave lands too soon , every man will be killed by the last run of our strafing fighter planes , or the last murderous thunder of rapid fire naval bornbardment . " " And if they land late ? " " Mortars , " said O'Bannion in a hushed tone . " Deadly accurate mortars . Snipers tied in the tops of coconut trees : some of them always survive until the landing . Then the Banzai charge , a fiendish horde , screaming and squealing like pigs ? swords , bayonets .... " O'Bannion was so engrossed in his narrative that he did not notice the return of MacDougall , who had walked up the beach from his boat and stopped just behind him . " The beach is the most dangerous spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked , unprotected beach ! It is there that the beachmaster stands , his duties so important that he is consistantly protected by an armed sentry . " The doctor opened his mouth to speak . Sensing his question , O'Bannion hurried on , " The flow of vitally needed supplies ? tanks , artil-  | lery pieces , shells , rifle ammunition , medical supplies , provisions , water , gasoline , even bulldozers to smash open Jap pillboxes ? all this must flow like a vast river from the supporting transports , to the boats , to the shore and across the beaches . It is the beachmaster 's job to see that the flow is efficient and uninterrupted , that the needed supply item gets to the right place at the right time . He is here for any logistic emergency . I tell you gentlemen , " O'Bannion paused dramatically and gestured with his muscular right arm , " a beachmaster walks under a living canopy of fire . It is only by God 's grace and the full fury of every gun in the fleet which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs that we have a chance of living to tell the tale of it . " The spell of his own eloquence was upon Mike O'Bannion . Shirttails flapping against hairy legs , he took a short turn up the beach , then swung about to seaward as if looking through bombardment smoke to see if the Belinda were still there . Then he saw MacDougall , and the dream faded from his eyes . Recovering himself quickly , O'Bannion introduced MacDougall to the two staff officers . He did it graciously , yet in the manner of an elder statesman presenting a worthy son . " This officer is our boat group commander .... " " Yes , I bring the beachmaster his lunch , " said MacDougall . " We just got the recall signal , Mike . Time to get everybody aboard . " When his command boat had been hoisted in , MacDougall climbed the ladder to the pilothouse to make his report . Gedney had just taken a shower and was already dressed in the bathrobe of snowywhite toweling which he often wore on the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MacDougall thought ; they 're always spotless ? even add to his dignity . He looks like an old Roman senator , sitting up there in his high chair . Gedney returned MacDougall 's salute absent-mindedly . MacDougall coughed ? he had better say something . " Well , sir , we finally got the boats away . " Gedncy focused clear blue eyes upon MacDougall . " Yes , " he said , " you got them away in exactly one hour and forty-three minutes . " The words soaked into MacDougall 's brain like water penetrating a dry sponge . One hour and forty-three minutes : what a bust ! MacDougall waited for the last of it . He was one of the few officers aboard who had yet to receive one of Gedney 's tongue lashings . Now it was his turn ; the Old Man was selecting the bitterest , most cutting phrases he could think of . All that delay ? what a sloppy rehearsal it had been . The Belinda was no more in shape for combat land-  | ings than a pink cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on watch there waited in pleased anticipation , thoroughly enjoying the prospect of watching another officer squirm . Even though they liked MacDougall , they were amused at his discomfiture as he stood beside Gedney 's high chair , trying to hide his embarrassment from them . Color faded from the sky ? still no movement from Gedney , no word . It became quite plain to MacDougall that his presence was no longer desired . While the enlisted men exchanged knowing glances , making the most of an entertaining situation which had turned out disappointingly , MacDougall walked slowly from the pilothouse and down the ladder . Chapter 6 " A WAY ALL BOATS , away ! " A hundred and more public , address speakers shouted the order across night-black and wind-tossed waters of Maalaea Bay , Maui . A newly formed division of five attack transports , the Belinda among them , lay to in a line parallel with the shore , launching boats and embarking troops for the last of three scheduled practice landings . Three miles from shore loaded boats were formed into waves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the many loud-speakers on each of the five ships , from portable and built-in bull horns , came a bedlam of sound ? amplified instructions hurled into the night . Then , at moments when all but one were silent , they heard clear , monotonous words of a mechanized voice calling out instructions and orders to boats and to debarking troops . The PA of each ship had its own peculiar tone , in which voice and personality of the speaker was submerged . Robots , thought MacDougall , visualizing five thousand soldiers crawling down fifty debarkation nets into a hundred and fifty landing craft ; robot voices ordering human flesh to perform like robots . A destroyer took station at the designated line of departure , two miles from the beach . Loaded landing craft wallowed in the chop at eight knots : thirty minutes from destroyer to beach . Boat groups from the other transports were converging . Wave tied to wave until there were five waves of thirty boats each , winged out and on their way to shore . MacDougal blinked a signal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a chilly morning for August in the Islands . The command boat leaped and rolled , throwing off spray with each toss of her bow . Troop-laden LCVPs were less fortunate , moving sluggishly , seeming more reluctant to rise than to fall . As MacDougall moved to the right flank of the first wave and began to guide in to shore , he found himself abreast of Boat 22 with serious , dark-eyed Tommy Jones at the wheel . It was too early for color to show . Navy blue and Army drab looked alike . Men filled the rectangular cockpit , standing packed together . Wind-carried spray streamed over them so that helmets , faces , packs and backs dripped salt water . Those faces seemed strangely alike ; what a blank look men got while heading for the beach in a VP ! Helmets seemed to tell more of a story than faces . A helmet did something to a man , pressing his brains down in uncomfortable protection , giving him stereotyped likeness to others about him , reminding him that he had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . MacDougall spat out a mouthful of spray and wiped his face with a soggy handkerchief . For the next few minutes all these helmets were in his care ; the helmets must arrive on schedule , here and at that enemy beachhead they would face together before many more days . He looked astern again ? all waves coming along nicely , thirty boats in each , the last wave composed of thirty-six-ton LCMs with their heavy ramp gratings tracing the lightening sky . Bracing himself against lively movements of his command boat , MacDougall trained binoculars upon each wave flag . From one to six they were all there , all in order , all properly spaced ; even Bud Foster from Kansas was formed up according to plan . Shore line was much closer now ? sand , trees and shrub taking on detail and beginnings of color in early morning . MacDougall checked his time and held up both hands in a slowing motion ; with this following sea they were running a little ahead of schedule . He checked a visual range he had picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach . Five degrees off his port bow the roof of a house showed through the trees . That would be Kihei village . Red Beach was two hundred yards south of Kihei . This rough position might do for a practice landing . On that unknown enemy beach he must pick out more accurate marks than this ? from outdated charts , from photographs taken by speeding plane or hiding submarine ? pick out the marks without ever landing first to look . Combat landings had to be right : you could n't land men in front of defenses they were supposed to flank . If an old navigator had difficulty in getting oriented , how about these boys  | from the Middle West ? Surely they were confused and concerned ? or did they fail to realize yet the accuracies required of this sort of landing ? No chance to ask them now . He felt premonition in the air ; yet something was strange . Then he realized : no fireworks , no shooting  --  no sound except roar of engines . Dive bombers swooped down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans simulated strafing runs from one end of the beach strip to the other , yer fired no guns . Despite all efforts to bring realism to this last practice , the inhabitants of Kihei village could not be sacrificed . Battleships and cruisers , purged of their practice bombardment at nearby Kaho ) lawe Island , were returning to Pearl Harbor , leaving hard-working destroyers to guard rehearsing transports . The very silence of guns seemed like a sound , like the first rustling of leaves before a gale . MacDougall looked at the radiolite sweep hand of his strap watch : ninety seconds until H Hour . Time to run the surf and hit the beach . He looked back at his boat group : all craft with the big white I ? painted full-size on bobbing ramps . Wigwagging attention with his signal flags , he then held out both arms horizontally in signal for each wave to move up from V formation to line abreast . He jerked a thumb t i Hatcher , who opened his throttle more . " Try twenty-five hundred , " MacDougall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertically held flag up and down in the speed up signal to all boat waves . " Head right a little more , Hatcher . There ; that 's it . Steady as you go . Keep that tall tree dead ahead . " As the first wave cut into the surf line , Hatcher cut throttle . The command boat paused just outside the breakers , like a sheep dog watching a flock . Thirty VPs rose on the back of a breaker and groaned towards shore with engines wide open . Running in a slightly ragged line curved to fit the bay contour , they hit the beach . Almost at once thirty ramps dropped upon wet sand ; helmeted infantrymen with rifles ready jumped from ramps with seemingly mechanized unity . Splashing ankle or knee deep , depending on their luck , they ran up across the strip of loose sand with awkward , laboring steps , and disappeared into scrub vegetation beyond the line of algaroba trees which fringed the bay . Wave after wave swept in through frothing surf and landed . Each me ramps dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n twenty-eight minutes three thousand soldiers crossed the sand and disappeared . Landing combat supplies for them would be the slow and difficult job . In the Belinda 's last wave came tall Ensign Marty with the four tank lighters : the biggest ensign with the big-  | gest boats . In two he carried medium tanks and in two , heavybladed bulldozers . By the time Marty arrived , O'Bannion had set up his communications post , beach markers and unloading signs . Randall 's salvage boat planted obstruction buoys around a large coral head to warn landing craft . Most boats were able to retract without accident , but rough water swung some about and broached them to , beam on to sand and sea . There waves pounded them steadily , driving them higher up the beach and harder into the sucking sand . Randall came with towing lines , but unless he managed to start towing almost the moment a boat got into trouble , he was unable to get it off . Leaving capable Dr. Bell to raise his own medical tent , O'Bannion stripped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Waist deep , he bellowed orders to boat crews , beach-party men and shoreparty soldiers alike . " Bear a hand here , men . Quick now ! Take a strain on that towline , Randall . Now the rest of us here , rock her ; rock her ! " Five LCVPs were gotten off in this manner and sent back with the rest to commence unloading the Belinda . One craft remained hard and fast , port side stuck in the sand , the other taking breaking waves aboard . MacDougall ran alongside Marty 's tank lighter , pointing to the broached boat . Marty 's coxswain , a man broader and nearly as tall as the six-foot-four ensign , jerked clutches and throttles , spun his wheel and beached the fifty-six-foot steel craft a few feet to one side of the broached boat . A husky soldier in olive drab coveralls started the bulldozer 's engine roaring and lurched over the ramp grating and up the loose sand . The LCM 's coxswain backed off his heavy craft , spun her around with her twin screws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towline from the stranded VP . O'Bannion shouted unheard against roaring twin diesels , " Set up on your towline and we 'll rock her out of here . " A jolt against the beached craft from landward flung O'Bannion away and down into ? the water . Rising , sputtering and wiping his eyes , he turned inland to see the giant bulldozer pressed against the plywood transom of the thirty-six-foot landing craft . Giant blade had bashed a large hole through which sea water was pouring into the cockpit . O'Bannion floundered ashore and ran up to the bulldozer , shouting , " No , no ! You ca n't do that ! This is a plywood boat . You 'll smash her into kindling- wood ! " High in his seat , the big soldier in coveralls looked down on O'Bannion and spat p stream of tobacco juice over the iron treads of his  | behemoth , then said , " Boats ai n't no good on the shore , sailor . " " You back that bulldozer out of here right this minute . " The soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hair plastered to his thick chest . " Who d' ya think you are , sailor ? A chief , I suppose . Well , I do n't take orders from no chiefs . I get my orders from Sergeant Kelly . " The soldier opened and closed his throttle , allowing the machine to express his defiance and contempt of the Navy with thunderous roars , and exhaust popping . Then he eased in the clutch and began once more to push against the boat . O'Bannion threw himself before the blade of the bulldozer , muscular arms outstretched and hairy chest heaving with anger . The bulldozer inched forward until the blade pressed against his chest , then stopped . The soldier on the machine and O'Bannion in the sand glared at each other . Rank and branch of service had less and less bearing on the situation ; it was just one Irishman against another . A major of engineers came running out of the brush and down the beach . " What 's the trouble , O'Bannion ? " he asked . " This fool is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The major looked from the beached boat to the bulldozer driver . " You do n't need to force Army co-operation on the Navy , Corporal . " " But , Major , I got my orders from Sergeant Kelly , sir . He ordered me to push this Navy boat back into the water . " " Malumphy , " said O'Bannion angrily , " you 've got to control your shore party . When I talked to you about us working together , I did n't mean this . " " The major can see I 'm just obeying orders , " said the driver sullenly . Major Malumphy grinned . " This is the beachmaster you 're arguing with , Corporal . He 's in charge of everything here , up to high-water mark , where I take over . Looks like you 're pressing beyond Army jurisdiction . " " I 'm sorry , sir , " spluttered the corporal , obviously not sorry . " I did n't know . " O'Bannion 's anger had cooled enough to flash his thoughts back to the salvage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the beach-party men , " bring me an armful of spare life jackets . " A hulking sailor dropped the signal flags with which he had been directing loaded landing craft to appropriate stockpiles on shore , jumped into the distressed boat and collected a big armload of kapok life jackets . O'Bannion stuffed three of them into the hole smashed by the bulldozer and used the rest to make a pad which he held against the boat 's ramp . Then he signaled the bulldozer to come ahead . Chewing stolidly at his plug  | cut , the corporal brought the big blade carefully against the pad of life jackets and began to shove . O'Bannion gestured to Randall , who had clambered aboard the tank lighter and in a moment the big craft answered the bulldozer roar for roar as she took a strain on the tow rope . " Come on , boys , " yelled O'Bannion . " Rock her . Let 's break up this suction . " Soldiers and sailors gathered around the boat and rocked in unison from side to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved from shore . An unusually heavy wave broke against the boat , surging around and lifting it . Slowly at first , then faster , the boat moved . She pulled away from the bulldozer , dropping life jackets into the water . The tank lighter had her now ; she was afloat . Malumphy walked back to dry sand with water squishing in his boots . " That was real Army-Navy teamwork , " he said to O'Bannion , who had retrieved his shirt from a nearby lantana shrub . " When my men get to know you , you 'll have no trouble with them . " O'Bannion managed to smile again . " I 've got enough to do without wrestling with bulldozers . " He had his shirt on again . The bulldozer corporal stared at the twin silver bars on O'Bannion 's collar . An officer ! Ile should have known . He turned his bulldozer around with a clash of hastily shifted gears and roared off some distance towards the crab Lantana before pausing to spit another stream of tobacco juice in the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ashore to help with the boat , watched the corporal with amused interest , then turned to O'Bannion . " It 's lack of clothes , Mike ? just complicates life for you on the beach . " " What do you mean ? " " Remember the first dry run at Kaneohe ? You met the brass on the beach ? no pants . Now along comes an Army bulldozer and gives you a bad time . You need a little rank , but your shirt with the collar bars is hanging on a bush . " The beachmaster looked out over his stretch of sand , where ammunition , drinking water , gasoline , provisions and artillery pieces were being moved shoreward across the ramps . Then he looked back at MacDougall and said , " Before this day is done , every soldier working on this bit of beach will know Mike O'Bannion on sight , with or without pants and shirt . " Mike sheltered his paper work and his rolled-up sleeping bag in a small pup tent . Although it was physically impossible for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the place as his headquarters . While resting from frequent trips about the beach , he sat on a stout box in front of the diminutive tent , chest held high and knees  | pointing outward while his clear blue eyes surveyed the beach . Mike was at his best when seated informally . At such times his robust personality gave an aura of dignity to a packing case or a weatherbeaten log which Gedney in his captain 's chair aboard the Belinda might well have envied . Dr. Frank Bell , the Belinda 's assistant surgeon , established his beach-party medical aid station about thirty yards inland from O'Bannion 's headquarters . He chose a site shaded by overhanging algaroba trees which gave protection from the sun and , theoretically , from enemy observation . Bell , an experienced surgeon who had left an excellent practice in Pennsylvania to serve in the Navy , was responsible for providing medical aid to casualties occuring on his section of the beach and those brought out from the line by Army medics . Selecting the most seriously wounded first , Bell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully into empty landing craft for return to the Belinda 's sick bay . During the afternoon simulated casualties were brought to the beach by sweating stretcher-bearers who had little sympathy for the healthy bodies they were required to carry . One party of four bearers staggered over the last of the uneven ground and dumped a healthy-looking soldier unceremoniously at Bell 's feet . " Look at that fat deadhead , " one of them said , wiping rivulets of sweat from his face with a shirt sleeve . " I 'll bet he gained five pounds on the trip . " Bell smiled briefly . He was a friendly man , but the handling of casualties , simulated or real , was a matter of absolute seriousness to him . Ile knelt down and read a tag on the man 's shirt : " Compound fracture , left femur . " Bell called for splints and bandages , then assisted by two corpsmen , he swiftly applied appropriate bandages and splints . The man was placed in a basketlike wire Stokes litter and his foot fastened to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actual fracture , I would really set it tight , " Bell explained as he worked . " We want to be realistic , but there 's no sense in making this fellow more uncomfortable than necessary . " " It 's all right with me , Doc , " said one of the waiting litter-bearers . " You go right ahead ; set him up good and tight . " Bell smiled again . " That 's where I draw the line between practice and actuality , " he said , as he filled out the special diagnosis tag provided for the purpose . Then the man was carried to water 's edge and placed in a VP for return to the ship , amid jeers and mock cheers from his fellows . As Bell watched the boat retract from the beach , O'Bannion  | called his name urgently . " Come quick , Doctor . Someone 's badly hurt . " Bell ran up the beach and found O'Bannion looking into the brush . " Look up the trail there : man bleeding terribly ! " Bell tensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something spurious about that blood . " Color and texture are wrong , Mike . Blood does n't drip like that ; does n't coagulate that fast . " Some wag had brought red paint from the ship and poured a little upon a man marked " Flesh Wound , thoracic region . " Bell applied suitable dressings without comment . He liked to joke about other things , yet , though he thought it quite natural for soldiers to joke about wounds to come , as a physician the prospect did not strike him as being at all funny . Ammunition and provisions were now coming to the beach in quantity , most of it fastened by metal straps to sledlike skidboards called pallets . Except for small patches of coral protruding through otherwise smooth sand , the Maalaea beach was ideal for dragging palatized cargo ashore from opened ramps of landing craft . The bulldozer which had confronted O'Bannion earlier in the day was now making short work of the otherwise backbreaking task of moving tons of artillery ammunition from water 's edge to ammunition dump . Still operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three shells each over ramps , out of shallow water and up the beach . Whenever a pallet caught on outcropping coral the corporal opened his throttle . " Something 's got to give , " he told Boski , the beach-party signalman , " and it ai n't going to be the ' dozer . " Splinters were shaved from runners of pallets , which sometimes overturned . After an unusually severe struggle , in which the stout wire towing strap nearly parted , the corporal looked down admiringly at the still unexploded ammunition . " That ammo is plenty tough , " he said to Boski . " Why , it 's almost as tough as the ' dozer . " Sandwiched between two loads of ammunition came a VP loaded with two pallets of actual human blood plasma . MacDougall shook his head . Gedney had officially protested against landing this precious stuff in its vulnerable glass bottles during practice landings . Evidently he had been overruled . MacDougall directed the coxswain to the section of beach reserved for the medical stockpile . " Tell them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he shouted , seeing the bulldozer racing along the beach to meet the boat . Before O'Bannion or Bell could reach the boat , the damage had been done . Warnings by the boat 's crew were drowned out by the roaring bulldozer . With speed developed by practice on ammunition loads , shore-party sol-  | Biers hooked on the first pallet and the bulldozer yanked it out of the boat , over the ramp and started up the beach , where it caught at once on a coral ledge . The corporal knew what to do about that ; he opened wide his throttle . The wire towing cable tightened nearly to breaking point , then , with a jerk , the pallet came free and overturned , jerking the glass bottles across sharp coral . Every bottle in the pallet but one was smashed , and gallons of human blood plasma poured out on the sand . O'Bannion went for the bulldozer driver . " You addle-brained idiot ! " he roared . " Do n't you know the difference between howitzer shells and plasma ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor , then sat rubbing his chin and looking at the smashed bottles . Bell paid no attention to the bulldozer . His eyes were focused upon one shattered bottle . The sand beneath it was wet with spilled plasma . Broken fragments of glass glistened wetly , reflecting the sun . Gradually the glass dried , dulling the reflection . Astonished at the silence of the corporal , O'Bannion cut his protest short . The corporal climbed down from his machine . Together with Boski and other soldiers and sailors gathered about , he lifted the second pallet bodily and carried it carefully up the beach to the medical station . A neatly dressed Army officer came along the beach from the direction of other ship 's shore parties and stopped beside Dr. Bell . " How do you do , sir , " he said rather ceremoniously . " I 'm from planning staff . " " I 'm Bell , Navy surgeon . " " Fine practice landing . " Then the colonel noticed the broken bottles . " What happened here ? " he asked with mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a practice landing . " " Valuable stuff , but expendable , " said the colonel crisply . " We allow for such mishaps when calculating logistics . " " People gave their blood for it , " said Bell . " They might as well have taken so many pints of red paint to the blood bank . " " Oh , come now , " said the colonel . " It was an unfortunate little accident , but these rehearsals have to be realistic . " Bell had nothing further to say . The planning officer poked at the sand with the toe of a polished boot . Then he coughed . " Well , I must be getting on . Good afternoon , Doctor . " Bell 's eyes followed the nattily dressed colonel as he walked along the beach . Then he picked up the bottle of plasma which had survived the accident and carried it to his medical aid station .  | Landing on the practice beach for the last time , MacDougall wiped salt water from his eyes with a sweat-soaked handkerchief . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to O'Bannion . " Eleven hundred tons of combat gear unloaded and hauled from ship to shore , dragged up your beach , dragged down to the boats again and hoisted aboard the Belinda . " O'Bannion tucked in his shirttails in readiness for his return to the Belinda and the critical scrutiny of Captain Gedney . " Two long days and nights of it , " he said . " Even Mike O'Bannion is ready to wash the sand out of his hair . Let 's load the troops and be done with it . " Down to the beach came soldiers from the Belinda 's battalion landing team , returning from practice deployment in the cane fields . They walked in small informal groups , drinking pop and eating candy bars . The Fighting Sixty-Ninth had " liberated " the Kihei village general store . Chapter 7 DURING THE SHORT PASSAGE from Maui to Oahu , Gedney called O'Bannion and MacDougall to the pilothouse . It seemed almost like being home again , MacDougall thought : the Old Man in his high seat , freshly shaven and unperturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four transports , the Belinda steamed over blue , sky-calm water which reflected cumulus floating above the bare and rocky shore of southwest Molokai . " We have received unloading orders , " said Gedney , his voice professional , yet pleasant . Yesterday 's beach seemed far away . The two lieutenants were refreshed by a shower and sleep in good bunks . Watching Gcdney reach into his dispatch case to withdraw the yellow commanding officer 's copy of a message , both looked forward to simple discharge of troops and combat materiel at some cozy Pearl Harbor berth . Gcdney glanced at the dispatch once more , though he knew its contents well , then asked , " Are you familiar with Pokai Bay , MacDougall ? " " Yes , sir . It 's a small , unprotected cove about twenty miles along the coast from Pearl Harbor entrance . There 's a sugar mill inland ? no unloading facilities that I know of . Surely we are n't ? " " But we arc , " said Gedney with a pleased little smile . " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the landing exer-  | rise , considering the greenness of all hands . With a more experienced crew you should be able to do better . Therefore I requested permission to land both troops and combat load on a beach , using our own boats . The other four transports are going in to the supply docks at Pearl Harbor . " Beachmaster and boat commander exchanged unhappy glances . " These supplies , Captain , " O'Bannion said in a protesting voice . " These same supplies are to be landed on enemy shores . There was a lot of damage , sir , in spite of all I could ? " " I am quite aware of that , " said Gedney . " And you , MacDougall ; I suppose you are about to protest that your boats need overhaul . " MacDougall colored . " I was going to mention it , Capt'n . Bottoms are torn up , especially boats which broached on the beach . Engines are in bad shape and we only have one spare . " Gedney 's smile broadened . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are getting somewhere . Do you gentlemen expect that we will go alongside a pier to unload for battle ? " Gedney held up a hand for silence . " Of course I expect you to be anxious regarding boats and beachhead materiel . This is an opportunity to learn how to take care of both under sustained ship-to-shore operations . " " There was that plasma , sir , " said MacDougall . " Naturally , naturally , " Gedney rose from his seat like a cantering rider , gazed ahead , instructed Randall , who had the deck , to slow down two turns , then faced MacDougall again . " Plasma and any delicate instruments will be held aboard until we enter harbor . It will not hurt the Army to replace a few cans of provisions and five-gallon tins of gasoline here . It will hurt the Army tremendously if we fail to put troops and equipment ashore expeditiously at our objective . " Well , that 's that , thought MacDougall . I wonder what we 'll smash up next . By midafternoon the Belinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rocky shore . Gedney left Quigley in titular command , with Fraser , the ship 's salty first lieutenant , in actual charge of the bridge . Then , together with O'Bannion and MacDougall , he was hoisted out in the command boat , which also served as captain 's gig . With Gedney seated in the stern sheets and Hatcher at the wheel , they set out for shore . Far to starboard the column of four transports , herded by destroyers , headed for Pearl Harbor docks and liberty for all hands . To port , and much closer , lay a former private yacht , now commissioned as a patrol craft , while offshore cruised a protecting destroyer-escort.  | The bay was even smaller than MacDougall had remembered ? a shallow , unprotected crescent , fortunately situated on the lee side of Oahu . Passing close aboard the patrol yacht , which was anchored some thousand yards from shore , they noticed some of her crew swimming over the side , others fishing from the fantail . Those on watch were dressed in gaily colored shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet made no comment . Drawing closer to shore , they found the central approach unobstructed , but waves breaking far to seaward indicated dangerous shoaling on either hand . Passing through the gentle surf , Hatcher grounded the boat . Gedney clambered out on the command boat 's bow and jumped ashore . Failing to reach dry sand , he landed in knee-deep water . Ignoring wet shoes and trousers , Gedney walked ashore with what dignity the loose sand permitted him , and set out to explore the beach . Marks of tracked vehicles indicated that the beach had been used previously for a military practice landing . Puffing ahead some fifty yards , O'Bannion found a gravel road which led inland to a nearby railway loading platform . The three officers retraced their steps to the beach . O'Bannion dug his toe deep into the sand . " We 'll have to lay metal landing mats here , Capt'n , " he said . " Otherwise we 'll never get wheeled vehicles across this loose sand . " " Excellent , " said Gedney . " A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much more difficult than the one at Maalaea Bay . " A skiff powered by an outboard motor landed not far from the command boat . Three men , one much taller than the other two , stepped ashore and approached Gedney . All three wore swimming trunks , and the big man also wore a floppy sun hat , plaited from native grasses . He tossed Gedney an informal salute which seemed more island greeting than military courtesy . " Good afternoon . Capt'n Gedney , " he said in a deep , musical voice . " I 'm Luke Stephens , skipper of that yippy out there . My regular assignment is patrol duty around the islands , but now and then I 'm ordered to stand by a practice landing . " " Excellent , " said Gedney , extending his hand . " My destroyerescort is going in and I would not care to sit out there alone during a landing exercise . You have sound gear ? " " Yes , sir . We 'll watch out for subs . " As Gedney introduced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time had rolled back a century . There  | was something incongruous about this meeting on the shore of the impeccable Gedney and this big man , casually dressed in swimming trunks and native hat . Stephens was undoubtedly islandborn ? ruddybronze complexion and soft , yet limpid , brown eyes indicated that some of his forebears had belonged here for many generations . His commanding personality , not depending on clothing for dignity , was instantly felt . He seemed the host and Gedney the guest , as if he were a Polynesian king welcoming a twentieth-century Captain Cook . " You 'll have to be very careful with this beach , Capt'n , " said Stephens . " No landing is possible during kona winds such as the one which blew out two days ago . Even in fine weather the surf is treacherous . " " But surely now . . . " Gedney paused . Authority stronger than naval regulation rang in this man 's words . Stephens looked out to sea and along the flanks of the small beach , saying again , " Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at peace , just as it is now . Then , without any warning at all , two or three big swells will run in and take charge of the place . They are dangerous here in the center of the bay , but the greatest danger lies on either hand . " Gedney nodded in polite but casual appreciation . " Thank you for the local knowledge , " he said , twinkling blue eyes glancing at sand and surf but lingering on his little flotilla of three vessels . O'Bannion 's attention was on the loose sand . In his mind he supervised the pegging down of great rolls of steel landing mats . MacDougall watched the curling line of breakers , considering Stephen 's warning . This cove had a comfortable intimacy . Used as he was to the sudden treachery of wind and wave , MacDougall 's senses were lulled by a feeling of security . There was no pressure here , no time schedule to meet . Surely everything would go well . Stephens discussed details of the landing with MacDougall , offering to station his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As they said good-by , he reminded : " Do n't forget to watch that surf . " He pointed out to sea . " The reef extends further than you can see when it 's calm like this . " " Wo n't that tend to form a natural breakwater ? " asked Gedney . " No , sir , it 's just a sneaky sort of thing out there to trip the deep swells and send them crashing . " " I 'll watch it , " said MacDougall as they got back into the command boat . He thought Stephens was being a little fussy . Strange , too . That big , self-possessed man was not the type to try to make an impression on Gedney . Furthermore , he seemed so at home in this  | place . MacDougall watched Stephens dive into a wave and swim through it and over the next with casual skill . This was a nice little place . Landing here would be almost a picnic . Early the following morning the landing got off to a good start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in thirtyfive minutes and without accident . Troops climbed down debarkation nets into assigned landing craft without fuss , mix-up or a single bad spill . Moran and Alvick got the first heavy lifts overside and into Marty 's tank lighters without delay . Sherwood formed boat waves and brought them to the line of departure plainly marked by the patrol yacht . Stephens dispatched waves to shore according to the schedule MacDougall had given him . Going on ahead to investigate surf conditions MacDougall found them to be excellent . Waves splashed on the sand with velvety softness . By sunrise the beach was crowded with soldiers who were detailed to assist Malumphy 's shore party until the arrival of the special train which would take them back to the fort . O'Bannion had landing mats in place , lacking only the anchor pegs which had been inadvertantly loaded in the bottom of a lower hold . With the exception of this minor detail , unloading proceeded without a hitch . Now that forty-eight-hour passes were nearly within reach , soldiers happily mimicked officious orders of the Belinda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a light rain squall , then the sun shone clear and warm . The gentle land breeze was fresh and sweet with mingled island scents . Fine weather cumulus drifted along the horizon between blue sky and even bluer sea . The feeling of impending conflict , sharpened at Maalaea Bay , was softened here in the intimacy of this little cove . By noon the breeze shifted offshore and freshened , and lanquid shore scents were replaced by salt tang . Combat cargo came ashore in a steady stream , carried by a continous procession of Belinda landing craft . Heading shoreward with their burdens they wallowed sluggishly , rising slowly , sliding deeply on the backs of following swells . Returning empty , they tossed buoyantly against head-on waves . Quick work was performed in the surf and on the beach . MacDougall and Sherwood kept boat traffic moving and directed it in , as and where needed on the beach . O'Bannion and Malumphy , aided by the extra manpower , got boats unloaded and turned about in a hurry . Randall stood by in his salvage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with steadying lines . The moment a boat coxswain began to loose control , he was thrown steadying  | lines ? given a tow if necessary . His boat was straightened out stern on to sea before it could flounder beam on and be washed against the shore . By midafternoon occasional groups of heavier swells began to run ito the bay , tossing approaching landing craft high and pooping over the transoms of unloading VPs . The boat group was gaining in experience , and with the co-operation of the beach party it began to appear that all would be kept under control . Nevertheless , by i600 hours , heavy offshore swells began to roll in . LCVPs were broached to in alarming numbers , and even the fifty-foot LCMs needed all the leverage of twin screws to hold bow on to sand while unloading . MacDougall began to understand what the islandborn Luke Stephens had meant about wave action in this small cove . O'Bannion and Randall were busy full time with steadying and towing lines . Men struggled waist deep in the water , tugging at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramps to shore . MacDougall took his command boat out to within hailing distance of Sherwood 's VP . " You handle the rest of the boat traffic , Steve , " he shouted . " I 'm going to use my boat on salvage work . Randall is swamped . " " Are you punning , friend ? " Sherwood waved a lanky arm in acknowledgment . " I 'll police the surf line , Mac . Go ahead and rescue the perishing . " MacDougall grinned and turned to Hatcher . " Stand in close to the beach . We 'll take the left flank and share salvage with Mr. Randall . Have your men break out the towline . " As Hatcher complied , MacDougall added , " We do n't want to spend the night here digging wrecked boats out of the sand . " MacDougall had left the removable canopy of the command boat ashore this morning , preferring the better visibility of an open boat . When midday sun had scorched down , he had momentarily regretted this decision . Now he was glad ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and Hatcher could see all around , and the deckhands could get about to handle their lines in a hurry . He stood on the decked overbow , just forward of Hatcher and the wheel . Here he was clear of the towline and could watch beach , boats and sea . From time to time he threw heaving lines to landing craft in need of help . The towline was fastened to the heaving line . Deckhands in troubled VPs hauled it aboard and dropped the eye over their sternposts . After each craft had been safely retracted , towline and heaving line were recovered and gotten ready for the next boat .  | Most of the cargo was ashore now . In the face of a freshening wind , soldiers and sailors alike were working in an excited , vet pleasurable frenzy : laughing , splashing and heaving with all their strength . The end of a week 's grind was in sight ; there would be liberty tomorrow . The landing spot for various types of materiel stretched along the central portion of the cove . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched with concern while two LCVPs , loaded with artillery shells , headed through the surf together . They could not be handled at once . Carried away by the excitement of throwing goods ashore , they must have disregarded Sherwood 's instructions to land one at a time . He had better get over there . " Hatcher , " he called sharply , pointing to the two boats . " Let 's get them out of there . See those big rollers coming in along the shallows ! " Hatcher opened throttle ; the command boat rose on a swell and ran across the little cove just outside the breakers , then headed in towards the two VPs . The rolling swell was much heavier here at the edge of the cove . The two boats were already in trouble . In spite of anything their coxswains could do , they drifted closer to the shallow rim where surf crashed frighteningly against sloping sand . When within hailing distance , MacDougall climbed upon the bow of the command boat , his back to the sea . He steadied himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns which were just forward of the cockpit and hailed the two coxswains . " Ahoy in the VPs ! Back out of there . You 're in too far to straighten out now . You 'll get pooped with a sea and broach hard on that reef . . . . Back clear of the surf and get out of there ! Back out ! " Both coxswains heard his shouts but did not seem to understand . They looked around at MacDougall , faces bewildered , doing nothing . Unless they acted their boats were doomed . Now the command boat rose high on a rolling swell , lurched about , weathered the crest and dropped into the trough behind it . The machine-gun barrel to which MacDougall clung swung around . He staggered for a moment , then reached for a new grip on the gun and raised his megaphone ? those VPs would never make it unless they turned fast between swells and got out of there . Hatcher shouted a warning to MacDougall : " Look ? the sea ! " MacDougall turned around and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his boat and almost upon them  --  this was what Luke Stephens had been talking about . There was no chance of escape frorn it . MacDougall shouted back to Hatcher , " Open her  | up and head into it ! " With mouth wide open , Hatcher gaped at the enormous wave , yet gunned his motor at once and spun his wheel , swinging the command boat nearly head on to it . " Take it on the shoulder , " yelled MacDougall , gripping his gun barrel and looking up at the sea . " That 's it . Hold her there . Get some way on her , quick ! " No time to scramble back to the comparative safety of the cockpit . MacDougall wrapped both arms around the machine gun and hung on . The boat had beam and power ; if she could only plane over the top .... " ' hey were into the first wave now . It did not seem possible for them to rise over it , but the bow continued to lift , higher and yet higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it planing . While Hatcher , MacDougall and the boat 's crew held their breath , the body of the wave swept under them , lifting the boat by the middle , bow and stern hanging in space , propeller racing in agony until Hatcher was able to move his hand to the throttle . Squatting with feet braced apart , MacDougall rode the bow , clinging desperately to the gun . Thrust high , he caught a momentary glimpse of craft , shore and waves in the distance , but his attention was drawn to the deep valley of water before him . Then with a sickening sensation , as if the bottom had dropped out from under the boat , it plummeted into the deep trough and brought up with a shuddering crash which nearly knocked the breath out of him . MacDougall looked up at the second wave . It was bigger and higher than the first , towering above them in a sheer green wall , with sunlight gleaming through from the other side and foaming crest leering down upon them . He knew that the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first wave , the bow rose too slowly . These new-made Hawaiian seas were steep and close together ; the boat was out of timing with them . Nothing but a raft would have flotation to surmount this next wave . Instinct told him to dive overboard right through the sea and get clear of the mess ; he would be much better off without the boat . No , he thought , I ca n't leave t ! archer and the boys . His mind was motivated not so much by solicitude for his crew , though he felt that , as by the very impropriety of ouch an act . Instead , he dived headfirst over Hatcher 's head into the open cockpit , grabbed the coaming and hung on . The green wall of sea broke all over the boat , submerging men and gear in a tangle under water which filled the cockpit . MacDougall expected the shock of cold salt wave ; it was not the first time an  | angry sea had knocked him down . What surprised him was sudden pain from head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it flung him in the bottom of the boat . Weak from shock and pain , he struggled to his feet at last and looked about him . Things seemed strangely out of focus . Through a blur of dizziness he saw the others : Hatcher 's face had a vacant stare , as if looking but seeing nothing , yet he still clung to the spokes of his wheel , the motor-mac sat in a drooping posture over the engine box ; the deckhand huddled further aft in the bottom of the boat , chest deep in water , staring at his buddy on the engine box . Nobody said a word . MacDougall 's face stung . It must be salt water , he thought , and wiped a forearm across his face , then looked stupidly at his arm . It was covered with blood ; something must have hit him . There was an awful pain in his throat ; the rest of his body felt numb . He looked around the cockpit . There it was : a machine-gun mount , scarf ring and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bow . It had carried away , rooted-out bolts and all , and , buried in that green sea , had struck him down . A mirthless jest passed through his mind : I never knew what hit me . At last he looked out beyond the limits of his boat . The salvage boat lay to , ' close aboard , the two craft joined by a short towline . They were out beyond the surf line , wallowing in the trough , but safe . Randall had come in and towed them out of it ; that had taken guts . Now Larson cast off the towline , threw in his clutch and came alongside . MacDougall could see several inches of water sloshing around in the salvage boat : they had taken one too , probably coming in to tow them out . Looking at Jim Randall he saw a trickle of blood running from his chin . MacDougall began to speak for the first time : " You 're hurt , Jim . " His lips formed the words but no sound came out . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted to ask about the two ammunition boats , and he could n't ask . Perhaps they were still in trouble ? or down under . As he looked towards the left flank of the little cove , where huge breakers crashed on the reef , Randall read his mind . " Those two boats are all right , Mac . They heard you in time ; gunned it out of there beam on . They just got to deep water about the time you took that sea ? shipped a little water , that 's all . I 'll bet it 's a long time before they get caught ? " Randall looked at MacDougall 's face . " Why , Mac ! The whole side of your jaw is laid open ! We 'd better get you in to the beach to Doc Bell . " That 's strange , MacDougall thought . My throat hurts awfully but  | I do n't feel anything on my face . He ran his fingers down his cheek and over the jaw . Something wrong there ; the flesh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time he managed a hoarse whisper , using all his effort , " That 's funny . Do n't feel anything there . Throat hurts . " Then he pointed to Randall 's chin . Randall nodded . " Just a little cut , " he said . " Let 's see , now . Everybody else O.K. ? " Hatcher got his engine started without difficulty ? what rugged things those engines were ! The two boats ran in and beached . O'Bannion got everyone out of the boats at once and put in relief crews from his beach party . " I 've stopped all unloading , " he said . Waves were crashing on the shore , now , reaching out at the men scrambling from the two boats as if reluctant to let them go . The enlisted men were soaking wet and shaken up , but seemed otherwise unharmed . MacDougall tried not to show that he was hurt ; he felt embarrassed by the accident . His position now suddenly reminded him of the time he once fell down a cargo hatch at Shanghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hold as if nothing had happened , not wishing to let the coolies know that he was hurt by the fall . Here now was Mike O'Bannion trying to get him to lie down on a stretcher . MacDougall waved O'Bannion and the corpsmen away , took a few tottering steps and fell . After that he let them put him on the thing and carry him to Dr. Bell 's medical aid station . MacDougall 's body was a mass of cuts and abrasions . He was beginning to feel the pain now , an overall sensation of sting and bruise ? except his throat . That was a special sort of hurt . He began to shiver violently . Bell took over at once . " Cover hint up with blankets , boys , lots of blankets . " Corpsmen who seemed quite comfortable in undershirts tucked the blankets about him . " Just a little shock , Mac , " said Bell . " Here , let 's get at your arm with this syrette . " Bell stuck a needle in his arm , then got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool around with this at all , " he said . " Flynn will have to clean you up properly when you get back aboard  --  you 're as full of sand as an oyster . " Sailors carried the litter down to water 's edge again . O'Bannion eased in a ramp boat and they put MacDougall in the bottom , with Randall sitting beside him . The boat retracted from the beach . Soon he could feel it surging ahead . MacDougall shut his eyes and listened to the regular thump as the craft ran to windward . The trip out to the Belinda seemed long ; the wait alongside to be hoisted aboard seemed interminable . From time to time MacDougall opened his eyes .  | The ship 's rail was lined with men , all looking down into the boat . Some of the faces he recognized , but nothing interested him much except to get aboard and into a bunk . He heard voices : " Why , that 's Mr. MacDougall . " More voices : considerable discussion as to how he might best be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul the litter up on a hand whip ? Should they hook the boat onto a davit , or heave it up with a cargo hook ? At last Randall spoke up . " Hook her on and let 's get it over with . " The decision had been made to do this , and as he spoke the cargo hook came down . While the boat was being hooked on and hoisted aboard , MacDougall thought : We 've got to work out a system . Some day there 'll be a lot of fellows in litters , waiting by the boatload . But pain and fatigue bore in ; he put the problem off for another day and shut his eyes again . Now the litter was being lifted from the boat ; he was being carried down the deck . Voices buzzed about him like bees in springtime : " Easy there . . . . Gangway , boys . . . . Watch that door . " At last the surgery door shut and the buzzing faded away . The litter was at rest . MacDougall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright operating lights shining in his face from overhead , more lights reflected from spotless white bulkheads and corpsmen dressed in white . Then came Dr. Flynn with his teasing smile . " Well , Mac , you do n't look tight enough for a good Scot . Think I 'd better sew you up here and there . " They pulled off his wet clothes and joked about the sand . They put hot towels over his face  --  some queer stuff ? it was hard to breathe , yet he was still shivering . He had a hazy idea of what went on : pressure here and there , sting of medication , sudden stabs of Flynn 's needle ? the thing was sharp enough . What was he sewing on that leg for ? It was the other one that hurt . After much time spent in cleaning and probing , Flynn was sewing on his chest and , at last , on his face . Now the needle really hurt . " I 'm just trying to improve your face a little , " Flynn 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't want your wife to throw rocks at you when you get home . " While Flynn snipped and sewed , MacDougall thought of home : what a nice place to be . For a few moments he was able to push away painful reality , remembering Nadine and her gentle hands . Then Flynn 's needle brought him back to the Belinda . Another foulup in the boats . It could have happened to anyone , yet things like that should n't happen to him . Breathing seemed hard ? almost as if he had  | one of those boats on his chest , he thought . Boats , boats . . . guide in the boats to the shore . Look after them . Bring them back safe . At last they were done . MacDougall was wheeled to the empty isolation ward and put into a lower bunk . Here at last was rest . Drug-softened pain whirled around him , and in a relaxing blur he was carried off into exhausted sleep . About midnight he awoke to fresh pain : drugs and shock were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to find a comfortable position , but found none . From time to time he heard running feet on the weather deck above ? shouting , the whir of davit motors , steel blocks banging , cries of men tossing in boats alongside . Sherwood must be bringing the boat group back on board . It was a wild night on the beach . Five of the broached-to VPs were driven high and dry by wind and sea before the last boatload of Army materiel was landed . From then on it was a concerted salvage job led by O'Bannion , on the beach and as far into the water as he could wade ? assisted by Sherwood and his boats . Marty brought in all four twin-engine LCMs for towing . An hour after Major Malumphy had gone ? to the fort for a shower and a good sleep , they supposed ? he returned with a borrowed cherry picker and helped get the stranded craft into the water . By four in the morning the last VP had been dragged , lifted and pushed off the beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , battered up , but safe and well-worth repairing by Rinaldo and his crew . Gedney gave orders to get under way for Pearl Harbor . Off the harbor entrance he signaled dismissal and thanks to Stephens 's patrol craft , then stood in to quiet water . This time he did not order his crew into white uniforms . That afternoon Gedney came down to the sick bay to visit MacDougall . As usual the captain was freshly shaven , his clean khakis neatly pressed . With blue eyes twinkling , he shook hands . " Welcome hack aboard , MacDougall , " he said . As he chatted on , MacDougall began to sense that there was a deeper meaning underlying this casual greeting . There was no criticism of his handling of the boats . " You are a sailor and I am a sailor . We understand each other , " Gedney said . MacDougall was thinking , how different can sailors be ? Yet he noticed that Gedney 's conver-  | sation , all of it on a friendly , man-to-man level , seemed directed towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat group , which he had previously insisted to be the Belinda 's primary battery . " You must understand ? an executive officer with only three months experience at sea ? a navigator with deportment in keeping with Naval tradition , but inexperienced . I 'm alone on that bridge , MacDougall . There are some things that rank can not ? Suppose something should happen to me as it has to you ? What then ? " Gedney paused , and a chill began to sink into MacDougall 's aching frame . But surely , no , not that . The boats were a part of him now . He had sweat for them and even bled a little . The bitterness of exchanging command for a minor role on the Belinda was compensated for by those boats . Gedney continued talk of the many complications connected with running a ship like the Belinda , then suddenly he asked , " What is your opinion of Sherwood ? Do you consider him capable ? " " I certainly do , Capt'n . Do n't know what I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in boats all his life . He 's a natural leader and a natural with those boats . " MacDougall felt a warm glow for these men and boys who worked with him in the Belinda 's landing craft . Together they 'd make a team Gedney could be proud of . Gedney changed the subject back to MacDougall 's injuries . " Dr. Flynn is of the opinion that you should be ordered to the naval hospital at Aiea , at least for observation . " That would take weeks ! Those hospital people never hurried . Once they got their hands on you . . . . " Oh , no , Capt'n , " MacDougall said with his hoarse whisper . " Do n't let them do that , sir . They 're taking good care of me here ? after all , four doctors  --  I 'll be all right . I 'm sure I 'll be able to talk soon . I 've got to get back in the boats . " Gedney smiled benignly . " I 'm glad to hear that you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital for a check on your throat by specialists , but I 'll make sure , unless special treatment is needed , that you can stay with the ship . " " Thank you , Capt'n . There is n't much time , I know . We have to get busy right away with those boats . Sherwood can help me until I get back on my feet . " Gedney 's jaw set ever so slightly . Then he said . " You must rest your voice , MacDougall . Rest as long as you need ; get your strength back again , for I am going to need you . " MacDougall visualized himself in the command boat , flying over wave caps , lining up his landing craft . What was Gedney saying ? " You have confirmed my own obser-  | vations , MacDougall . I am going to make Sherwood boat group commander . " MacDougall rose up as if he were ready to get right out of the bunk and run up on deck to retain possession of his boats . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper . If he only had his voice ; if only he could explain ... . Gedney reached out and pushed MacDougall gently back on the pillow . " You have to be practical , MacDougall . Flynn reports that v ou will not be able to climb up and down nets for months to come . You will not be able to walk much for weeks , and you must rest what voice you have left or you soon will have none . " MacDougall struggled weakly against the pressure of Gedney 's hand , then sank back in the bunk and whispered hoarsely , " I 'll be all right , Capt'n . I 'm just bruised up . I can get into the boats at the rail . " Ile thought , I just love those boats ! Gedney sat still , waiting for this emotional outburst to subside . MacDougall heard running footsteps on the deck above , then sounds of a boat being lowered . Light coming in through the porthole was shaded momentarily by the passing boat hull . Then it was water-borne ; engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it seemed to MacDougall that it was leaving him ? all the boats were leaving him stranded in this regulation-bound ship . When engine sounds faded , Gedney continued : " I need a real sailorman on the bridge with me . Quigley and Harrison can take care of routine duties but they can not take the conn , particularly in times of stress . That is where you will come in . While you are recuperating , you can train new officers of the deck and keep an eye out for me . " So that was it , MacDougall thought bitterly . He had been neatly trapped . First by the sea ? a man could expect that , for the sea was a sailor 's natural enemy . Now these people who had rank but could n't do their work had hit him while he was down . He had given up his first command for active Navy service , anxious to do something useful in troubled times . Now he was a two-stripe stooge . MacDougall scarcely heard any further words of Gedney 's . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring through the porthole at a glaring parch of blue sky . Then he sighed deeply and managed a drink of tepid water from the carafe beside the bunk . Man , it 's stuffy in here , he thought . I wish I was out with the boats on a nice dry run . Later in the day a delegation of enlisted men came to call . There was Doyle , the lanky boatswain 's mate , Hatcher , Tommy Jones , the  | dark-eyed boat coxswain from San Diego , and Whitey McClintock , a friend of Hatcher 's who worked for O'Bannion in the beach party . They stood looking at MacDougall , holding out a large can of chilled pineapple juice , shifting their feet about self-consciously and having little to say , yet after they had gone , something of their friendliness lingered behind . Then a corpsman came and helped MacDougall to a shower . Cool , fresh water felt wonderful ; the last of sand and salt were washed away , and with them , so it seemed , a measure of his bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on watch pointed to the PPI scope while Harrison , the navigator , peered nervously over his shoulder . It was amazing , almost frightening to Harrison : that shovel-shaped surface antenna turning slowly at masthead height had picked up faint echoes from the tops of coconut trees growing on an island which was nowhere more than fifteen feet above the sea and twenty-three night-black miles away . The Belinda 's long sea passage from Hawaii was nearly ended ; the beaches lay not far ahead . Harrison made his reports to Gedney : distance and bearing to land . Other ships in the attack force also saw indications of land by this electronic mumbo jumbo and on the strength of pale green pictures seen in polar projection at the flattened end of a cathode-ray tube , the admiral sent out tactical orders in coded voice over the TBS . On " Execute the order , " the assault force of four battleships , four heavy cruisers , six troop-laden attack transports with their nine screening destroyers , turned in wheeling columns and headed for coconut treetops . Three escort carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to launch planes . Captain Gedney , wearing helmet and kapok life jacket , stood on the wing of his bridge , watching dark shadows of ships ahead while he chewed absent-mindedly on a bit of cold toast . He was conscious of the mass of soldiers grouped quiet beside combat packs on the weather deck just forward of the bridge . He felt these men , his crew at battle stations , the other ships around him and the distant land . Only a dim shadow here and there for his eyes , the rest remembered reports and instinct of a seaman . It seemed long and slow to the  | transport area and hoisting-out of all boats . He had trained his crew for this day ; much of what they did in the next few hours would be beyond his personal control . He had checked off details to be performed by each department of the ship to bring the Belinda to that precise spot marked with a penciled X on his chart , and from there to get boats away , troops debarked and landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked on his operation plan as Beach Red Two . Hearing rather than seeing his ship 's company busy in the dark at specialized tasks , he felt a surge of pride that they had learned so fast , then choked it down , remembering all that they still must learn . They were green and inexperienced . If only they could do well during the Belinda 's first introduction to combat , they might one day develop the efficiency of which he dreamed and towards which he worked . MacDougall broke into his thoughts now , whispering , " Radar has something out at thirty-thousand yards , one-one-five true ? not positively identified yet , but it looks like the LST group , sir . " " Good . They 'll be there for Yellow Beach inside the lagoon . There is nothing to hold up the landing now . The bombardment is scheduled to start in a few minutes . " MacDougall rested his injured leg on a stool at the extreme bridge wing . Gedney glanced towards the pilothouse . All was in deep shadow , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the column . For the moment there was nothing for Gedney to do . He had a little time for the relaxations of reflection . This atoll , main group of the Gilberts : he considered what little he knew of its history and culture . The operations plan called for delivery of seventeen hundred and seventeen tons of projectiles to the low and narrow shores of Butaritari . It was inconceivable that only Japs would be hit by them . Before the Japanese had come , it had been the quiet home of some seventeen hundred Gilbertese . White men had come before the yellow . Quiros , dreamy navigator of Portugal , had blundered upon this place early in the seventeenth century , but his visit had little or no permanent effect on the brown natives living there . They continued living their isolated lives according to their own freedoms and taboos , adjusting themselves successfully to life on a sandy strip of island which at no place rose more than fifteen feet above the sea . They subsisted on coconut , edible tips , pulp and seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow in shallow pits . Surviving , they grew hardy and fearless . Scorning delicious flatfish easily caught in the lagoon , they risked their lives in deep water beyond offshore reefs to capture tiger and gray nurse sharks , whose reeking flesh was savory  | to them . In eating these creatures , they believed that the man partook of the shark 's courage . Gedney peered about into the darkness : ship on station . He listened automatically to messages from the TBS and from his own radar . His active mind dwelt on sharks . He had no desire to catch one ; he did not like fishing . yet the thought of those brown men making such dangerous effort for something they believed worth while appealed to him . They were good people , he was sure ; good in the sense of a good Navy man who abided not only by rules and regulations but by ancient customs . A man had to have instinct for these things . Yes , decent folk , these Gilbert Islanders . Their struggle was with the elements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives ? and to repel the more avaricious traders from their shores , they lived in peace : island with island and family with family , respecting even to the square foot that space assigned in the thatched public house of each island to the members of a certain family . They sailed their canoes indeep water , miles from any sight of land , navigating by stars without aid of chronometers or trigonometry . And they sang to their children in one of their chants . . . Gedney thought for a moment . He had the thing in a book down in the cabin . What were the words ? Oh , yes , something like this : Mr. Stay , thou , the little one , Wink once , - wink twice . Thee I have chosen ; thou art sleepy ! Thou steepest , Mr. Star , thou the little one In a little cloud . O-o-o-qa-a ! Sleep ! Gedney paused , pleased at his excellent memory . Voice of the TBS broke in : directions to the minesweeping DD and to the bombardment group . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course change , then , sensing the long hours of concentration soon to begin for him , he sank back into his contemplation . It was because these natives had so little that they had been left alone for centuries , unmolested by the more quarrelsome of the world 's inhabitants . Living upon mere pinpricks of land , nearly lost in this greatest of all ocean 5 their security lay in remoteness and in undesirability to others . - At last the English traders came , hunting copra and bringing tradeeloth in exchange , introducing strange ideas of work  --  Yet the pleasant routine of island life was little disturbed .  | Butaritari remained in peace until December 1941 . While Manila and Hong Kong fell , Japanese came here to establish a seaplane base . Thev took what they wanted and dug in . Now the natives learned harsher meanings of work . A few months later , Americans came in a sudden raid : Carison 's Raiders , brought here by submarines . Landing quickly , they killed many Japanese and destroyed what they could of their works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and at nearby Tarawa . More elaborate defenses were made . According to intelligence reports brought in to Espiritu Santo by a former Burns Philip South Sea trader , most of the natives had been moved from the village of Butaritari to more remote islets across the lagoon . Some appeared to have clung to their familiar home sites . Gedney wondered about them . Would they suffer with the Japanese on this day of reckoning ? Now the bombardment began , first scattered shots as battleships and cruisers got the range , then , with thunderous explosion , smoke and flame flashed from long rifle barrels while shells began to crash into the unseen shore ahead . The first visual indications of land were great fires flaming upwards from Japanese oil dumps . Soldiers waiting to climb down lowered debarkation nets watched in silence ; there was nothing to reassure them in their first sight of the landing place . Sailors cheered ? sailors waiting behind silent guns on the Belinda 's weather deck , sailors on the signal bridge , sailors waiting to launch boats , boat crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like schoolboys at a game . Gedney went at once to the PA microphone and snapped on all groups . " Stop that shouting immediately , " he cried . " It 's disgraceful ! " The enthusiastic din died away , yet on the deck below Gedney 's bridge , some undisciplined voice yelled , " There goes another one ! Boy , oh boy ! Look at them Japs burning ! " Human sounds were soon under control aboard the Belinda , but the tempo of electronic din increased . Voice struggled with voice and all struggled with tropical static as the TBS speaker on the pilothouse bulkhead repeated orders of division flagships : orders to launch more planes ; orders to sweep mines , to close the beach with rapid fire of all caliber ; orders of ship maneuvers . Then came the secret signal for the landing to proceed as planned . It was up to each transport now . Sweep second hands on big brass clocks in each dimmed-out pilothouse had authority greater than captains . The clock on Gedney 's bridge was set to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gedney stopped before the clock . The sweep second hand was going down around the right side of its large , illuminated face . " Stand by , Bosun 's Mate , " he ordered . The boatswain 's mate snapped all groups of the PA and stood ready with his silver pipe . The sweep hand on the clock was rising . MacDougall , who had been backing the Belinda 's engines to get way off the ship , now pulled the handle of the engine-room annunciator to " Stop . " Gedney swung his right arm up vigorously , fingers pointing upward . " Away all boats , away ! " he cried . Standing before the PA microphone , the boatswain 's mate put the silver pipe between his lips and blew the long , wailing call for attention . Then he repeated the captain 's order , " Away all boats , away . " The PA shouted the words from truck to keel , from bow to stern . No man could escape the sound of that order , " Away all boats . " Instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released from brakes , whine of winch motors , hollow metallic clang of blocks against steel hull and cargo booms . Men shouted ; boats splashed into the water ; motors roared . The Belinda 's boat group was getting away . Soldiers milled about , pushing their way towards assigned debarkation nets . In the same restricted areas , boats were being hoisted out , hatches uncovered and military vehicles having top battle priority were being lifted from the holds . When the PA cried , " Away all boats , " Sherwood was leaning against the canopy of the command boat , which hung in davits just abaft the bridge . He had checked every possible detail , had spent hours with MacDougall studying charts and photographs which had been taken recently from submarines and from the air . " There are going to be a lot of discrepancies between what we see here and what you 'll see tossing around in that boat , " MacDougall had told him . " When the time comes , you 'll have to do it like the birds do when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hook or even with a chunk of coral . A fellow has the feeling for it , or he does n't . My two bits arc on you . " " Thanks lad , " Sherwood had said . " I 'll try and return like the swallows , too . " Now he was being lowered swiftly down , hooks released , engine roaring and Hatcher tooling him out to the starboard boat circle off the bow . Kruger was in charge of a similar circle off the port bow . As boats were loaded with troops , medium tanks and light artillery needed with the first combat teams , Sherwood formed them into waves . From time to time he glanced at other ships also lowering boats and debarking troops , but his full attention was required now  | to make sure that all Belinda boats were formed up properly so that units would go into combat intact . From the boats the whole panorama was changed ; shore seemed further off while the Belinda loomed before him . How graceful her tapering bow looked from here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sherwood tried to keep his boats together while MacDougall backed and filled carefully , keeping the Belinda on geographical station despite moderate trade wind and strong coastal current . It seemed to Sherwood that debarkation was lagging . He looked at his watch , carefully synchronized with the pilothouse clock . No , plenty of time . It must be him : impatient today ? yes , nervous . He was chilled by frequent passing rain squalls , of short duration yet sufficient to soak all hands in the boats . Concussion of bombardment was in the air . He would be glad when it was time to go . At last that time came . Sherwood wigwagged attention with his signal flags , then made the tight little circling motion with a single flag held over his head which meant , " Follow me in column . " Marty and his big LCMs , carrying medium tanks , Kruger and the first VPs , wave after wave , each in a group with the lead boat flying the wave flag , bobbed along after him . They made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sherwood dropped back to the first line of his own boats while the amtracks clattered on in a ragged line abreast towards the destroyer , which was now on precise station at the departure line . A signal hoist fluttered from her yardarm . When the flags were snapped down it would be time for the amtracks to head for the beach . The rain squall passed inland , leaving boats and men dripping and drying in bright sunshine . Nothing could be seen of the island now . " then the squall crossed the lagoon and the entire island shone fresh green and white , lying in a gentle curve from point to point and washed of smoke except for three burning oil dumps . Bombardment tempo increased now , so that while the island remained in view , it was not so clear and sharp . Entire coconut trees were tossed high in the air , turning slowly end over end . Distant battleships belched thunder and flame from fourteen-inch gun barrels . Yet more noticeable to men waiting in boats at the line of departure were sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid fire low along the beach . Sand and chunks of coral flew : Japanese defenses , perhaps . Sherwood wondered . Now , while other firing continued and carrier planes darted down from aloft to take over beach pounding , the nearby destroyer ceased  | fire . Smoke sailed away from hot gun barrels . Down snapped flags from her yard . Execute the signal ! Time for the amtracks to go . Away they clattered , beach-bound . No more orders or help ; nothing but engine failure , coral or Japs would stop them now . Sherwood moved his first wave of VPs and LCMs up into position . He looked back at the others : a little ragged but they would do . He looked at his watch . Two minutes more . Amtracks far ahead now ? a half hour 's run for them . He would nearly catch them with his faster boats before they crawled ashore . Those battleships were really going to it now . Flags again : Execute second wave . Sherwood signaled to Hatcher with his hand , then shouted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rpm . " His boat wave surged past the stationary destroyer . Some sailors on her decks waved , but no one in the boats waved back . They were under the shore 's spell now . Strips of sand and groves of trees which looked like green and white ribbon from the line of departure gradually began to take on definition . Trees showed up as individual units , some taller than others , some with curved trunks leaning out over the sea . The beach looked very rough ; much worse than Sherwood had hoped . A ragged staccato of explosions drew his attention back to the amtracks ahead : rockets fired from improvised racks . They landed far short ; probably trigger happy . They were supposed to fire one now and then as they closed the beach until they got the range ; then all were to let go . They certainly were n't waiting . Rockets shot up at a forty-degree angle , squatting on their flaming tails as they lobbed shoreward in a high arc , landing in shallow water with all the explosive force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ; any underwater mines off the beach would surely be detonated now . Hatcher was pulling at his trouser leg . Sherwood looked down , saw him making expressive ducking motions with hands spread above his head , then pointing towards shore and making jerking motions toward himself with fingers opened to represent bullets . He shouted something , but Sherwood did not hear . The hand signs were sufficient ; yes , better get clown . Japs would surely return fire soon . Sherwood scrambled around the canopy . Before getting inside he took a good look at shore through his binoculars . Off to port he saw a clump of especially high coconut trees with a big lumpy shrub in front of them which seemed to reach out over the water . Lots of rocks and big chunks of coral cropping up in the sand . That must be the left flank . Sherwood looked ahead : more rocks showing up . Say ! This was n't going to be good . Something over to starboard ? hard to make out much  | through his binoculars with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof . A native hut ; that 's what it was . He rested his eyes . Now Hatcher was yelling at him to get inside . Sherwood raised the seven-fifties for a last good look , steadying elbows on the canopy top . Several native huts . The beach looked better there ; of course , it would be . Natives would build on the good beach where they could launch canoes easily . He 'd move over that way . It was not according to plan but the plan was no good if it hung him up in the coral . Perhaps he was supposed to land where the huts were . He doubted that ; swift shore current was carrying him to starboard all the time . He could not be left of course . Aerial photos would n't show the huts ; they 'd be under the trees . Right or wrong , he would head that way ? have to take a chance on snipers in the huts . Surely they could n't survive this bombardment he had witnessed . The huts were all but demolished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat . Those amtracks were off to the left again . They 'd have to scramble for themselves ; his job was with the boats . About two hundred and forty men with all their gear in each of his waves . Well , get ' em in there , fellow . Now he could see patches of blue sky through the trees , glimmer of lagoon beyond , but most of this low ground ahead was thick with vegetation ? no use wondering what might be hidden there ; they 'd soon find out . Sherwood 's boat was running right wing to the first wave of VPs now . Those boats were working too far left . Ile wished that he were on the opposite flank so that he could push them over this way , the way MacDougall used to do it . Sherwood scrambled aft to the open cockpit and beckoned vigorously with his signal flags . Marty was staring at the beach ahead of him , running in with his four tank lighters ? everybody was looking at the shore . No use yelling ? thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the left wing . Look over here , Karl . Look , man ! Ah , there he was , nodding and motioning his coxswain to come right . Sherwood pointed to the huts , now plainly seen with the naked eye . Kruger got the idea ; he was pushing the VPs over now . For a time they bunched closely together ; coxswains exchanged irritated glances , then , understanding , began to guide right , coming in obliquely on a course to bring the lot to the only decent section of beach . Landing craft from other ships were bearing left to other feasible landing spots . It was going to worry the Army , but better to land too far down or up beach than to be hung up in coral . The VPs ? something knocking on Sherwood 's mind ? now he got  | its soldiers crouching down , just eyes watching the beach from under those helmets . He got the feeling that they were already personally committed to that beach , willingly or unwillingly . The boats were just filling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Hatcher was poking him again and pointing at the water . Something skittered along the surface of the water like minnows running from feeding tuna . Those were bullets ; Japs firing back . Nothing to do but bore in . Machine-gun bullets ricocheted all about them now ; red tracers coming from those thatched huts . Vinson , coxswain of the nearest VP , slumped over his wheel ? must have been hit . They were pulling him away . A soldier had the wheel ; he 'd have to watch that boat ! Now one of the dockhands had taken over ; the boat was straightened out now , boring in for the beach with the rest . Sherwood looked ahead again : amtracks rising out of the water like hippos after a bath . They rose higher and higher , lurching awkwardly from side to side as they crawled over uneven coral boulders . They were firing into the huts with their machine guns , but Jap fire had already slackened  --  perhaps the last strafing run of those hellcats .. . he 'd never know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to take care of himself until the VPs were in . Soldiers scrambled over the boxlike sides and dropped to the sand . Some ran for the bushes ; some hesitated momentarily as if confused , then followed the rest . Straight ahead was a beaten-up breadfruit tree , something Sherwood saw at a quick glance but would remember the rest of his life . Every branch was stripped naked of leaves , yet a few disconsolate looking breadfruit hung from some of the broken tips like jack-o ' - lanterns which had been left out in a storm . Watch the rocks , Sherwood . Do n't get sidetracked now . Over a little more ? reef on each side ; split the space . Water shallowing now , bottom showing ? rough looking stuff ? rocks and coral heads . That one bit of clear beach ahead was very narrow ; he 'd have to crowd the boats together . These were assault waves ; they had to land together and on time . Here they were at the surf line . Ninety seconds of time left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throttle and the command boat slowed while the wave of landing craft swept on . No turning back for them ; they were bound for the sand . Sherwood looked over his shoulder ; second wave coming along all right . Time for them later ; he must watch for the first wave of ramp boats . It was high tide . If they did n't make it now they never would . One boat came to a jolting stop , hung up on something . The others slid  | in almost to the sand . Ramps dropped one after another . Soldiers splashed out with their rifles ready . Get those boats out of there , Marl ! You 've got three minutes to get ' em out of there for the second wave . Marty had the big tank lighters well in ; big ramps clattered down , and almost at once medium tanks ground over ramps , splashed , jolted and climbed forward to join the fight . The second wave was almost in now and the first wave not yet retracted . One of them backing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be close . Sherwood was tempted to rush in , shout orders and advice . No , that would mean just one more boat in the way . It was up to Karl . Three VPs and two tank lighters backed clear before the second wave bore in past Sherwood 's waiting craft . Suddenly he was looking at helmets again : boat after boat studded with helmets and set faces . I le 'd already forgotten the soldiers of the first wave . It was boats , boats ? get the boats in and get ' em out again . Boats were his job . " Get the tow rope and heaving lines ready , " he said to his deckhands . " We 'll have to do salvage work until Randall gets here . " He 'd like to keep the tank lighters here ; they were the best salvage boats , but needed to bring in bulldozers , more tanks and heavy mortars . All second-wave boats made beach , but three broached to before they could back out again . Excited , probably . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag ' em out . " Sherwood managed to tow two VPs out . He was vaguely aware of thatched huts and of crippled coconut trees , one of which leaned a shattered trunk almost over his head . Boats , boats  --  get out the boats . " Take that line , boys . Throw it over your stern bitt .... Hook her on , Hatch . " The third wave swept past him , boats striking each other glancing blows as they forced in to remaining holes . Rocks , boats and coral : what a mess ! Here came O'Bannion , and Randall with his salvage boat ; he 'd have some help now . Two minutes later Sherwood realized that he 'd have to stop the fourth wave . Beach congestion was nearly complete . He 'd have to stop them . Those soldiers were needed in the fight and somebody would sear his hide for this , but he 'd have to stop them and send one in at a time , wherever he could find a hole to poke them . " Hurry up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair in his voice . Nobody heard him : explosions , confusions , intensity . Every man straining his guts . Nothing in the landing manual about this sort of mess , but they 'd get the boats in somehow . They must get the boats to shore !  | As Mike O'Bannion 's third-wave boat neared shore he forgot din and smoke of naval bombardment , he even forgot ground fighting now beginning under coconut trees close ahead . Beach , coral , salt water , hull of landing craft grinding on coral , weight of materiel to be transferred from boats to beach  --  these were the things now . Gunfire seemed like distant thunder ; his attention was given to the water under his boat . It was crystal clear , and peering down he could see lumps of coral , hundreds of small coral heads . If shallow water at beach line was like this , he was in for trouble . Coral heads would not overturn a boat , but they could stop her before she could reach shore . Here was a nasty lump ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by just as the boat next in line struck coral and brought up to a jolting stop . The rest of them swept on . He glanced back quickly and saw the coxswain trying to back off for a fresh start . Now O'Bannion looked carefully at the beach : rocks and coral . Two boats of his wave managed to get in close , and dropped ramps . Soldiers splashed out , knee deep in water , holding their rifles well up as they had been taught in countless dry runs . Some fell down in deep holes , but managed to flounder out , rifles held over heads , faces set and tense . One after another they gained shore , ran forward to cover and dived flat . A bomb landed ahead ? explosion followed by sounds of fragments returning to earth . Mike ducked instinctively , then realized that the stuff was inland . Something might hit them , but not that bomb . Good thing they only go off once . Something was missing ? that glorious panorama he had expected . Nothing heroic about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the beginning of something . Now his own boat struck coral with a fearful jolt . O'Bannion was thrown forward on top of Boski , the hulking signalman . Scrambling to his feet he shouted , " Back out , Cox'n ; back full ! " Oh that ramp  --  deep water all about them . " Stop it , you fool ! " he yelled to the deckhand who was releasing the ramp catch . " Back out , Cox'n . We ca n't drop the ramp here . " Obedience : good thing . He could see that the boat 's crew wanted to drop the ramp , get rid of them and get out of here . Instead the coxswain nodded , threw his clutch into reverse and backed clear . The VP swung beam on to shore , then as the propeller drove ahead again , she bumped around the coral head . " Fend off , " O'Bannion called . Boski was already busy with a boat hook . Others , following his lead , picked up posts for setting up beach markers . Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head after another . Coral scraped and ground under the wooden hull and along the steel-faced keel and skeg.  | The propeller sounded lopsided as if blades had been bent . The boat vibrated heavily ; yes , bent prop . Well , get her in and get the beach party ashore . " How deep is the water under the ramp , Boski ? " The big signalman reached over the ramp and thrust down a boat hook . " Two or three feet . " " All right . Drop ramp ! " Rattle and splash  --  whole boat seemed changed with the ramp flat , giving a sudden look direct into a coconut grove . A few trees down , tops shot from others , a few shell craters ? otherwise surprisingly neat . Boski was in the water now , wading the ten yards to shore , testing the depth  --  then back . They had a lot of heavy equipment to carry ashore . For the time O'Bannion ignored all other boats and running men . " Work fast , men . Get the stuff ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man here on this radio . " Time for him to go now . O'Bannion jumped off the flat extension of the opened ramp , sank to his waist , %lipping , sliding , floundering . Easy now , O'Bannion . You 're leader here . Go ashore right end up . Beach now : rough , unfriendly stuff . Sand under his feet , sand and rough coral . At last he reached dry ground . Now to orient himself . Whereabouts on the beach was he ? He was the beachmaster ? it was up to him to determine beach limits . Trees looked alike ; rocks looked alike ; the two tangents of land he had guided on were lost beyond overhanging vegetation . The beach curved ; he could n't get lined up by the ships , which might have drifted out of exact station . A sharp wham spun him around . What was that ? Close , anyway . Never mind , O'Bannion . Look at the beach , man ; quick now ! Over to the right a bit  --  in front of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind air maps and battle plans : so many yards measured off with calipers . That was on paper , most of it educated guesswork . This was wet sand and rough coral ; the stuff had to come in here . I Iere was Dr. Bell beside him , calm as usual . A man can look calmer than he feels ; perhaps he looked calm too . " Right here , Frank , " he said , " find a place to suit you near here and set up your aid station ? you 'll be out of the way of traffic . " Palmer ? where was he ? Oh , over there setting up his transmitter . O'Bannion started towards his radio officer . He wanted to run , but his feet sank deeply into coarse sand . He was puffing as he said , " No , Chuck , not here . Tracked vehicles have to come through here . Get a place by the coral  --  that wo n't make any difference to your gear . " Now for the markers . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to be bunched in that one small place where boats could come all the way in . What a beach ! Nothing but coral boulders . He wondered how they were managing on the other beach . Well , this beach , now . " Boski . McClintock . Bring the markers . There and there . Here and here . Yes , that 's right . " Here came Malumphy . " Ready to go , Major ? . . . Fine . We 'll bring the stuff in through here . It 's the only place just now . We can explore when things quiet down a little . " " Quiet down , Mike ? " Malumphy kidded . " This is the pay run . " Looking seaward , O'Bannion saw Randall busy setting buoys along each side of the narrow passage into the beach . A mess of boats were stuck on coral . The last waves were coming in now between grounded and retracting boats . Sherwood was out there with Kruger trying to untangle the mess . They would have to hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more trouble with the coral . Suddenly O'Bannion became aware once more of things more distant . Combat teams had moved on in . Engineers of the Army shore party were running , heaving and pulling . The stuff was beginning to come in . Then he looked out at the ships , nearly hidden in smoke . Quick flashes of fire leaped out from their hazy outlines . Blue of the sea with sun glistening on wave slopes . Somewhere he had felt like this before ? glory and the flag flying from the stump of that shattered coconut palm . . . . " Look out ! " somebody yelled . O'Bannion spun around . A bulldozer swept at him , dragging a pallet of ammunition . He floundered out of the way , barely avoiding being knocked down . No , this was different , yet somehow strangley like some feeling he had known before . Queer , he thought as he went down to take active charge on the beach , I feel like I 've been here before , yet it 's all so strange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Bell missed the shady algaroba trees lining Maalaea Bay . It was quite warm already and would soon be suffocatingly hot for wounded men under an unprotected canvas fly . Stray bullets and occasional Japanese sniper fire pinged in the nearby coconut grove . Finding a large shell crater , he called to his corpsmen . " We 'll set up here , boys . " Boski and McClin ?  | tock came up from the beach to help . They drove stakes and set up a canvas fly . Corpsmen prepared instruments and dressings . Before the tent was up , somebody poked Bell . He turned around to see four men carrying two litters . " From the boats , Doc . " They looked at him for instructions . Nobody seemed to be talking much . These lads had a bewildered look on their faces as if they did n't think a buddy could actually get shot ? even here . " Let 's have a look , " said Bell . The little fellow was a goner ? shot right between the eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as from the Belinda . Innoculations or perhaps cat fever : one boy in a line of boys at sick call . Whatever it had been would n't matter now . Bell turned to the other one , a tall coxswain badly hurt . Looked like a deep flesh wound . Bleeding badly  --  shock , too . Get busy . " Compresses , Harmon . No , the large ones . Syrette , plasma ? that case of sterile instruments . " While Bell worked , Boski put up the tent overhead , staking long canvas flies horizontally to allow light and ventilation while protecting the place from direct sunlight . Long before Bell finished with Vinson , the coxswain , and sent him on his journey back to the Belinda , the first soldiers to be wounded were brought in from the line . Army surgeons , waiting for their equipment to be landed , worked with Bell . ' Iwo were experienced surgeons ; the young intern worked rapidly on superficial wounds , and wrote up tags . Bell had a little singing feeling within him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze working through palm fronds outside the tent , and sunlight filtering down ; nothing that he could hear above gunfire ? just felt . I lc had expected to be depressed . Perhaps later on he would be , but now he was busy healing men 's bodies , feeling needed and strangely happy . At about 1100 Bell was finishing emergency work on a young private with a compound leg fracture . Bone fractures were his specialty ; his prewar practice had been in a small Pennsylvania mining community where broken bones were almost a daily occurrence . Winding last turns of adhesive around the splints , Bell remembered his clean little surgery with the south windows ; the smell of the place . It was something he liked to think of . Usually his memory slipped back to it easily ; now something interfered with the trend of his thoughts , something near . He had the feeling that he was being watched . Not by the usual onlookers ? he was used to that . This was more like a finger poking him . Bell looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | regarding him intently . He was a dark brown man , wearing a single garment of beautiful soft matting which was wrapped about his waist and secured with a belt of woven hair . His head was grizzled and his face deeply wrinkled , yet the flat curves of his wiry frame had a look of hardness and supple strength . Wonderful muscle tone , thought Bell ? amazing in such an old man . He must be over seventy , but I 'd think twice before taking him on . Perhaps it was the eyes , clear dark brown and almost twinkling . The old man was self-possessed , apparently unafraid , although his little island had suddenly become a blazing battleground , white men fighting yellow . Bell smiled at the old man , who continued to stand there erect and to regard him seriously , intently . At last he squatted in the sand , being careful to move no closer . Perhaps he wanted help . Some of his people must have been wounded by the bombardment . Speech barrier ? no way to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doc ? " It was the boy with the leg fracture . Bell reached for a paper cup , filled it from a five-gallon can and supported the young private 's head while he drank the water . Then he looked at the native again . The old man seemed to be concentrating on something very hard . At last , reading inquiry in Bell 's face , he pointed to the water can . Bell stepped across the shell crater , picked up a mess kit , filled it with water , turned the handle around and offered it to the islander . The old man took it with a steady hand . His movements were unhurried , almost casual . He tipped it until a few drops ran over the brim and fell to the sand ; then watched sand soak them up . " That 's good water , " blurted Bell . " Distilled on the Belinda . Tests less than two grains of salt . " Then he wondered why he had said the words ; they would mean nothing to this old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a careful sip , savoring the water in his mouth . " Good . " He said the single word in English , then turned and walked towards the village with rapid steps , carrying the mess kit steady in his hand . " Well , what do you know ! " Bell exclaimed . " Speaks English ! " After all , how was he to know what language we speak , barging in here with our fourteen-inch guns . A few minutes later the old man returned with the empty kit . This time he was accompanied by three women and several children . The women were much younger than he . One of them , obviously pregnant , wore what looked like the top of a loose cotton dress cut short at the navel . Her distended midriff was bare and a short grass skirt hung from her hips . She wore a necklace  | made from teeth of some sort  --  probably an amulet , for she fondled the thing as if seeking from it some measure of protection . The other two women were similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain degree of the old man 's assurance , but they stood back , waiting for him to make the next move . The way they looked at him he must be a chief . The children showed less restraint , smiling and squirming bare toes in the sand after the manner of all children when in the presence of strangers . The bodies of all these people were clean and their simple garments remarkably neat , Bell thought , considering the bombardment which they had somehow survived . " Water , sir , " the old man said , holding out the empty mess kit . A jeep bobbed over rough ground towards the tent , stretcher lashed across the engine hood : another casualty . Bell returned the mess kit to the elderly native and pointed to the water can . They would have to help themselves . Soon Bell was busy with another wounded soldier and all thought of the natives was pushed out of his consciousness . When he turned back to the tent door again , he was astonished to see a muscular Gilbertese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the tent . The old native was there again with the three women behind him , none of them showing any signs of exertion . Bell knelt down to have a look at the native on the mat . He was young and husky ? a handsome fellow ? yet his dark brown face had something of the bloodless look of ashes . Even now , when obviously in deep shock , there was a trace of twinkle in his clear brown eyes ? as if to say , " I made it , did n't I ? " He had a nasty abdominal wound , probably shrapnel or a bit of shell casing . Bell got busy in a hurry ? could n't let a fellow like that slip away . He hoped they had n't given him too much of that water . " I 'll patch him up and send him out to Flynn , " he said to Palmer , who came in with a message from the Belinda . " Pat is a good bellyman ; he 'll do a good permanent repair job on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo holds , where soldiers and sailors struggled together in the interminable job of getting out tanks , artillery pieces , gasoline , provisions , small-arms ammunition and heavy clover leaves of artillery shells . It was hot in the Belinda 's gun tubs , where tropic sun beat down almost vertically , reflecting waves of heat from steel splinter shields , yet it was more pleasant than engine room or cargo holds . During Condition One Able , the official watch status  | during ship-to-shore movements , nobody was ever off watch . Boat crews , beach party and bridge specialists worked the clock around without letup . The rest of the crew were rotated . Communications people manned lookout stations and helped out on deck . The black gang alternated four hours in the engine room with four hours at the guns . The deck force alternated eight hours at cargo and boat handling work with four hours at the guns . Thus gun crews , while required to be alert against surprise Japanese attack by submarines , planes or surface craft , were also resting from more strenuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade and breeze , but no relaxation . Messages came in continually from voice radio , flag hoist and blinker searchlight , which was used during daylight ? orders from admiral and commodore ; reports and requests from beach and boats . McDougall was at the starboard bridge wing , watching bearings of shore through pelorus sight vanes . The ship was drifting again : there must be a two-knot set along shore towards Ukiangong Point . He looked down over the side . Several landing craft , recently returned from the beach , were drifting in the water within hail , waiting to be called alongside for loading . Tired sailors sprawled in boat bottoms and across engine boxes ; even coxswains were as nearly prone as possible , making languid movements from time to time to prevent their craft from drifting away . Here , alongside the Belinda once more after the landing under fire , they felt secure enough to remove helmets and life jackets during this short respite before they returned to Red Beach . Three VPs and a tank lighter were tied alongside , being loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at number four hatch . MacDougall took another look at bearings : still drifting . Time to get ship on station off Red Two ? submarines had been contacted off the point by a patrolling destroyer . Yet if he came ahead on the engines now , all unloading would have to stop until the ship settled down again . He decided to wait a little longer . The Old Man was yelling again . MacDougall swung inboard as Gedney came down from his seat and out the bridge wing on the run . " Megaphone , " cried Gedney angrily as he brushed past MacDougall and jumped upon the bridge-wing platform . " Someone get me the megaphone . . . please ! " Gedney hissed out the last word . A messenger came running with the megaphone . Gedney grasped it , dropped it across the bridge rail with a hollow bang and shouted through it to the men drifting in landing craft within hail . " Ahoy in the boats . Put on your life jackets . Put on your helmets . Keep them on ; keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men called to their mates , sprawled in sleep . There was a general yet a very slow movement towards compliance with the captain 's order . Had these men been on the bridge they would have answered , " Yes , sir . " Regardless of resentment or physical discomfort they would have quickly scrambled into battle dress . In the boats there was a feeling of remoteness from the bridge . Boat engines hummed their idling song and exhausts sputtered with impersonal indifference . Boat crews were weary from vibration and rolling about ? from exacting demands of timed wave landings ? from roar of gunfire and lack of sleep . They obeyed their captain , but it took a little time . Gedney realized the futility of arguing with his enervated boat crews . Having given the order , he ignored the subdued murmur of grumbling which carried up to the bridge , yet felt the necessity of explaining his attitude to somebody . Turning to MacDougall he said , " A ship sometimes sinks in two minutes ; a ship 's boat may be wiped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a bomber or a torpedo may get through . " After a pause , Gedney added , " And were it not for that , the wearing of battle dress is an order from higher authority . " Now Gedney 's thoughts turned to boat repair . Two landing craft which had come to grief on the coral were in the skids , where shipfitters and carpenter 's mates hurried repairs . " When you get the ship back on station , go down and see what progress is being made with boat repairs , " he told MacDougall . " I 'll watch ship for you until you get back . " MacDougall limped aft to the fantail , where he learned that both boats would be ready within the hour . Returning , he squeezed between slingloads of gasoline and ammunition , managed the vertical ladder to the boat deck and limped forward towards the bridge . Here he met Boatswain Torgeson and , turning to speak to him , neglected to raise his game leg over one of the steel cables which crossed the passageway abreast each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , he tried to lift his leg clear , tripped and fell flat on the deck . More surprising than the fall and the pain was the blast of heat radiating from the steel deck . " It 's that trick leg of mine , " MacDougall said , as Torgeson helped him to his feet . " If that knee puffs on me again , Flynn will probably try to throw me back in the sick bay . . . . Well , I 'm not going to the sick bay ; I 'm going back to that bridge if I have to crawl . " MacDougall took an experimental step . It was painful , but he 'd make it .  | Torgeson was laughing . " Anyway , I see you stenciled on your amphibious insignia . " MacDougall looked down at black tar marks running across his trouser legs at the height of the wire . He grinned , " This was the last pair I had that was n't marked . " Limping towards the bridge he reflected on the boatswain 's remark . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Belinda off Makin that morning , nearly all bore horizontal tar marks on their pants . Davit cables were no respecters of rank or service ? they just threw you and branded you with the insignia of the amphibious rabble . Climbing the bridge ladder , MacDougall 's eyes came level with Gedney 's neatly shined shoes , then he noticed the captain 's trousers . Carefully washed , starched and pressed by his Chinese steward , they bore faded but unmistakable evidence of contact with a davit cable . " What arc you grinning at , MacDougall ? " asked Gedney . His good humor had returned , but the lieutenant knew better than to strain it . " I just hit the deck and Torgeson was kidding me about it , " he said , but he was thinking : Do n't tell me the Old Man has joined the amphibious rabble , too ! Standing on a slight rise above the beach , O'Bannion paused to wipe his sun-raw face and neck with a sweat-soaked handkerchief . The tide was nearly out , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had managed to get landing craft in to shore , one at a time . In spite of coral and rocks he had been able to land field artillery guns . Major Malumphy set up supply dumps behind the line which were soon receiving gasoline and water in cans , ammunition , provisions and repair parts for the machinery of battle . Boats from Red Beach One , which was even worse , added to the congestion . Salvage boats worked full time . " We need a channel blasted through this coral , " O'Bannion said to Malumphy , who joined him on the rise . " You see what I 'm up against . No amtracks and no bulldozer . It 'll take forever to wade in with the stuff . " " I 'm doing what I can , Mike . We 've got dynamite now and I 'll get right after that blasting . They 've given us priorities on amtracks and a bulldozer . " " I ca n't drag ammunition ashore with priorities . I need a bulldozer . Look at those men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 105-mm clover leaves ; they weigh about two hundred and eighty pounds . " " Battle has priority , Mike . It 's about time for the secondary landing inside the lagoon . Listen to the bombardment over there . " " There wo n't be much battle anywhere if they run out of ammunition . " O'Bannion pointed disgustedly towards the two brokendown amtracks parked above the beach line . " I suppose they 'll let us have that one with the broken shaft ! " A group of native children , dressed in short grass skirts , approached one of the broken-down amtracks curiously . One boy of about ten years , bolder than his fellows , reached out and touched the amphibian 's steel side . Startled at the heat , he withdrew his fingers quickly . Nevertheless , the amtrack challenged him ; a few moments later he climbed up the treads and scrambled aboard , looked down triumphantly at his playmates , then with a yell of delight jumped down into the deep cockpit . Other children followed , and soon both amtracks were swarming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , increasing numbers of adult islanders appeared . These older ones seemed stunned by the strange and awesome happenings to their island . Some asked for water in fairly good English , saying it had been denied them by the Japanese during the last three days . They made motions indicating that rain was the only source of supply . " Japs probably saving it for combat , " O'Bannion said to Malumphy . Then he called McClintock and instructed him to dole out water from a five-gallon tin . After polite thanks by their spokesman , the natives withdrew from the beach and squatted together under the shade of battered coconut trees , watching ships , boats and these strange white men , comparing differences in their appearance and actions with the Japanese who had preceded them to this beach . Chapter 10 THE LST vibrated and heeled over as she followed two destroyers into the lagoon on the opposite side of Butaritari Island from the Belinda and Red Beach . Ensign Bud Foster , who , with his pal Ted Faure , had been assigned from the Belinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat and climbed into the small control  | cab of the lead amtrack , soon to be launched into the lagoon to lead the first wave of the second landing into Yellow Beach . In a way the trip from Hawaii had been a vacation : no watches to stand , no senior officers acting superior , and little to worry about until that big fourengined Jap " Mavis " and the three " Bettys " made a run on them the day before . Now was different . With Faure to assist , it was up to him , Ensign Bud Foster , to guide in the important first wave of sixteen amtracks to the landing at Butaritari village . It was here that the strongest Jap defense was expected . That 's about all he knew , except for a half-hour lecture before maps and photos of the island before they left Pearl . " There are four wharves inside the lagoon ; all off the village and spaced well apart , " the briefing officer had said . " Yellow Beach is between On Chong 's and King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a sandspit with machine gun emplacements here between the two . Uo n't land there ; guide right , next to On Chong 's Wharf . That will be your best mark to look for when you come in . " Even looking down the commander 's pencil to the flimsy paper with its legend of pillboxes , rifle trenches , tank revetments , barbed wire , coast defense gun and so on was frightening enough . Bud was no fool ; he understood clearly why Gedney had selected the two of them for this job . As they left the briefing room and headed for the LST which was to take them two thousand miles to Yellow Beach , he said , " You know why Gedney picked us , do n't you ? " " Sure . We won the competition on the shakedown cruise : two ensigns most likely to foul up . " " Remember that story he told in the wardroom : every ship always sends its best men . That 's what we are , Ted , best men , the most expendable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't either , of course . What I mean is ? this Yellow Beach and all ? lot of responsibility we 've got . Got to be timed just right , ' he said . Everything 's synchronized . ' I do n't think we 've got very much to go on . Imagine a civilian contractor giving a job like this to us ! " " Imagine any civilian getting near Yellow Beach if he could help it ! " As the LST shuddered astern inside the lagoon , Bud still felt that he had very little to go on . He wanted to run up on deck and have another look at smoke-obscured shore lines . Everything was buttoned tight inside this floating warehouse . He had to stay with the  | amtracks now . LST sailors ran about the tank deck while her first lieutenant yelled orders . Doors swung wide and the big ramp clattered open , revealing lagoon in bright sunshine ? deep blue water , shallower emerald paling to white on the reefs . Butaritari village was obscured by a dense pall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then coming towards them with the light breeze . At last he made out a wharf , but which wharf of the four he could not tell . Where was On Chong 's Wharf ? Suppose he landed in the wrong slot ! " Well , Navy . You ready ? " It was Captain Lang , the company commander . He climbed up and squeezed in between Bud and the driver in the amtrack 's diminutive control cab . The deep well behind them was filled with combat infantrymen . Lang 's usually pleasant face was set , almost expressionless . His mind was fixed on the beach , on what he would do when this amtrack got there . It was just like a record : the turntable is revolving ; you set the needle at the edge of the groove and it grinds on in . The tune is there ; the notes are set . What he would do when they landed ? that was his record . Nothing on that record about today 's chances or how he felt about home , his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night hours . They were put away now ; his thoughts were grooved to the inside of this lagoon off Yellow Beach . Bud had been watching the shore . Between drifting smoke clouds he had finally located all four wharves . They were all low : small-boat stuff , with the two biggest ones to the right . Yellow Beach lay be , tween these two . His stomach seemed to whirl in space ? this uncertainty . Bud turned his slow , boyish grin to Lang . " I 'm ready , " he said . " Ready as I 'm going to be . " Then the PA whistled ? even LSTs had PAs . " Away the amtracks . " Engines roared and echoed in the tank deck ; treads clattered as Bud 's amtrack lurched down the ramp , then splashed in the water nearly up to her coamings . Sudden change from riding high to deep immersion in lagoon waters was confusing to Bud . With his eyes so close to water , landmarks were much harder to identify than from the higher tank deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting from shore . Bud looked at lagoon water lapping near his face ? like drifting downriver in a bathtub , he thought . Now where is On Chong 's Wharf ? Somehow he found the wharf again , and somehow got all sixteen amtracks in line abreast and reasonably lined up with shore . Ted Faure was at the other end , his job to squeeze the amtracks over to the guide . It 's up to me now , Bud thought . Just three weeks ago MacDougall was jumping me for straggling , and now I 'm  | guiding in a pay-run first wave ! Bud felt no elation whatsoever ; he would willingly exchange jobs with almost anybody , even with one of those fellows clutching rifles in the deep cockpit behind him . Two destroyers were pumping shells into Yellow Beach now . They also acted as control craft at the line of departure . Bud headed his wave to pass between them . Roar of battleship gunfire , which had slackened after the Red Beach landing , thundered all out again . Smoke obscured beach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the corner of On Chong 's Wharf and , while Bud watched , one entire corner of it collapsed . Golly ! he thought . If they shoot my wharf away , what will I use for a mark ? The 1 ) 1 ) gave the signal , and Bud started the ragged line of amtracks churning shorewards . Things were hazy in his mind from then on . He listened to the amtrack 's clattering treads , thinking how odd that he could hear them above the bombardment , then wondering whether he really heard the treads or just felt them : push , push , push , push ? little handfuls of water thrust astern on either side of the amtrack as it crawled across the lagoon towards the reef . Bud looked back at the second wave : tank lighters with big ramps , rising and falling deliberately over the smooth-surfaced ground swell rolling into the lagoon from sea . Turrets of medium tanks they carried protruded above their sides as if already searching for targets . He spared one glance for soldiers in the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps they were seasick . Others just looked at each other with expressionless stares , or stretched eyes to the level of the coaming and stared at the shore they approached . The Army driver was having trouble steering the amtrack ; they were supposed to be guide , yet their clumsy vehicle wallowed from side to side like a rooting hog . Complying with bombardment schedules to a split second , all naval gunfire suddenly stopped . After a few moments of quiet came the roar of carrier planes diving down , followed by the multiple shock of exploding bombs . Then more planes , one at a time out of group after group , diving down , pulling out , some treetop low ; falling sticks of bombs ; more explosions amd more smoke , fewer trees along the beach ahead . Before Bud could accustom his nerves to this , a signal rocket went off down the line , curved up and landed nicely at the beach line . Then all the amtracks let go with their rockets : flames thrust back , an inhuman whooshing sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then quickly down , and more reverberating thunder along the beach . Bud looked at his watch : seven minutes to go . Bombs still falling  | and newly arrived Hellcats strafing the beach with chattering machine guns : beach sand pocked with sand spurts , shallow water , where they were due to land , now riffled with thousands of driving bullets , tracers hissing as they quenched . All this lethal rain was to stop just before the amtracks arrived ? the briefing officer had explained it casually with a pointing pencil . Bud 's line of amtracks were less than a thousand yards from that beach ; they would soon come under the bombs , the spatter of machine guns on diving planes . Bud wondered if his watch was right , if the planes could be late ? delayed en route somehow and now going through their part . Perhaps the amtracks traveled faster in this smooth water than planners expected . On the LST coming down from Pearl he had asked these questions and many more . Nobody seemed to know ; they just rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How close were they supposed to come anyway ? Did the pilots know ? Perhaps some of those pilots knew less than he did about the timing of this landing ; perhaps while traveling at high speed over a strange area it was impossible for them to judge distances . Bud became more concerned with these carrier planes than with the unseen Japanese enemy . He wished that he could ask somebody now ; he was just a green ensign . Always before there had been some big shot around to make important decisions . Here was an invasion coming in to land with Bud Foster to guide it . He felt like a man sitting astride a rocket , steering it somewhat this way and that , yet having no control over its speed or ultimate destination . Find On Chong 's Wharf , that was his job . He had studied plans and photos , recognized the wharf and hung on to it with his eyes . The landing just ground on ; somebody had started it and he was in it , steering a ragged line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe something had got out of gear somehow . Bud looked up at the sky again : little black specks of dive bombers sitting up there , still waiting to come down . He reached over and grasped Lang 's shoulder , shouted , " I think we 're ahead of schedule . Those planes will blow your men to bits . " No change on Lang 's face , still set with that fixed expression . " Think we 'd better slow down ? " Lang , too , was shouting to be heard , but did not seem to be excited . Bud nodded and the driver cut his throttle . Other amtracks surged ahead , bulging the line . Bud stood up with his signal flags and waved them down . Ted Faure at the other end of the line had been watching him ; he too slowed his end of the line . Tank lighters in the following wave surged up close , looming as if their great ramps would crush low amtracks under  | water ; then they too slowed , keeping a reasonable distance astern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud thought ; but while he waited he worried about the shore , wondering whether he was doing something necessary , perhaps brilliant , or something that would further foul up this biggest job the Navy had given him ? had given him because he was considered more expendable than other of the Belinda 's boat officers . He felt no elation or power over men and machines ? only pressure , pressure . Ten minutes later the air strike slackened and Bud started the first wave forward again , hurrying them now , for if his watch was anywhere near accurate , he was late where no tardiness was considered excusable . Standing up on the small foredeck of his wallowing craft , he watched to make certain that all the others were moving . Lang yanked him down , pointing to quick , small splashes in the water just ahead : machine gun fire coming at them ? he wondered where from . Wreckage on the wharf ahead as well as to the left of what looked like a seaplane ramp at the end of King 's Wharf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunken hulls , beached in the shallows . Splashes reached out across water towards him from that direction . Bullets spattered against the amtrack . Bud ducked automatically . Once more he looked out . Shore breeze roughed swell tops now ; it was hard to trace bullets . He kept his head down for nearly a minute , then felt the jolt as the amtrack struck coral and ground slowly up and over the reef 's ledge . One amtrack far down the line scrambled up the seaplane ramp off King 's Wharf . Transition of Bud 's vehicle from unskilled swimming to lumbering travel on land took place in shallow pools and reef flats . Thrown around by one especially heavy jolt , Bud looked back and saw tank lighters make sudden stops at the reef ledge ; those heavy ramps dropped and medium tanks rolled out . One he watched wallowed ahead a few yards , then dropped nearly from view into a deep coral-bound pool , and stopped . Heavy explosion ahead brought Bud 's eyes front . No telling where that came from . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire crashed against the unarmored amtrack . Bud ducked again , keeping eyes barely high enough to see ahead through slits in the steel plate now closed across the windshield . The amtrack lumbered up to dry land ; now the Army was on its own , Bud just a passenger . He hung on as the vehicle careened around or over wreckage of demolished native buildings . The driver seemed to have forgotten his throttle , which remained wide open . He  | steered this way and that as if anxious to get through the strip of village . Ignoring gunfire , Lang raised up and looked all about , trying to orient himself . Now he tapped the driver 's shoulder . The amtrack stopped suddenly , throwing Bud violently forward . Shattered coconut logs lay in a crisscrossed jumble ahead , some resting on remains of buildings they had once shaded . Progress ahead or to either hand was impossible . An umbrella of explosions in the air about them tore at Bud 's ears . Lang yelled to the driver , " Back her out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the amtrack in reverse and lurched backwards . Bullets spattered the side again . " Duck ! " yelled Lang unnecessarily . Then , " Back up some more . There 's a hole to the left . We can round it and go ahead again . " At this moment Bud scrambled out of the cab without a word to Lang and dived for shelter amid rubble of a wrecked dwelling . The amtrack moved on out of his sight . Bud lay still under cover of coconut logs and a section of weathered frame siding until gunfire in his vicinity slackened . How long he waited he had no idea . He had lost all sense of time and had forgotten about his watch . Once the wave had landed , time had returned to casual importance again . Bud stood up and looked about . Fighting seemed to have moved eastward and somewhat inland on this narrow strip of the island 's middle . Looking up at trees still standing , he thought about snipers , then shrugged . Nothing had hit him yet ? amazing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so seemed a natural step towards return to the Belinda . He had been given no specific instructions regarding this . A rifle cracked sharply ; Bud dived for cover ? perhaps this was n't going to be so easy . After a few minutes of silence in the vicinity , he crawled cautiously forward . Coming to a small clearing , he saw one of the amtracks ? hit by a shell , one entire side blown open and the endless track torn off . Three bodies lay on the ground beside it : Americans . Bud inched his way around the clearing , eyes examining trees ? anything which might provide hiding to snipers . Looking up , he stumbled over something soft and warm . A shudder swept through him , shook him ? body of a little Oriental lay there . The chest was nearly blown away , ribs and lungs a bloody mess , yet the ashen face looked unharmed . Upper lip curled back , exposing buck teeth . The eyes were already glazed ; otherwise the facial expression was natural : remote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed his way through rubble of village and grove . Regaining  | the beach area , it was a relief to see Americans on the move again . Nobody paid attention to him other than a quick glance at his bluegray helmet . Men and materiel were moving in across the lagoon reef . Outward bound , he seemed to be breasting the human tide alone . At water 's edge he found Lieutenant Finnigan , force beachmaster , remembered from dry runs in Hawaii . Busy establishing the beachhead , adjusting theories of plan to D Day realities , Finnigan had no time for casual talk . Depth of water was two feet less than expected ; only a few spots allowed landing craft to cross the reef . Low tide would be better here ; boats could come to reef edge , then cargo pallets could be dragged to dry ground by amtracks . Until then men must wade to shore , carrying heavy armloads from broken-up pallets . Bud knew nothing of the over-all situation . He waded out to a boat and struggled back over rough coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt better doing something . As Bud passed Finnigan on his return for a second load , the tall beachmaster reached out an arm and stopped him . " I 've got a job for you , Ensign . You 're from the Belinda , are n't you ? " " Yes , sir . " " The flame throwers are fouled up : no oxygen tanks ? do n't know where they are . Take one of those empty boats , go outside the lagoon to the Belinda and bring me back a load of oxygen tanks as fast as you can . I 'll radio ahead ; they should he ready when you get there . " " Yes , sir , " said Bud , eagerness and relief in his voice . Work to do and a big two striper taking the responsibility . And the Belinda .. . After these two strange weeks away it would be swell to see the familiar ship , to see the gang for a few minutes while the boat was loading . He ran down to the beach and splashed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now sand in his heavy beach shoes ground salt water into blisters . Say ? he could get dry socks from his locker ! His mind jumped ahead to the crowded little room he shared with Faure , Kruger and another ensign . It would be almost like cornincr. home . The first empty boat he reached was from an LST . Bud scrambled aboard , explained his mission to the coxswain and was soon on his way out of the lagoon . Sky which earlier in the day had been blue and clear was now obscured with dust and smoke ; air smelled of gunpowder and burning oil . Waters outside the lagoon looked sparkling clear . It would be good to get away from here and out into clean , unobstructed water once more .  | Once aboard the Belinda , Bud was greeted warmly by his friends . I leading for his stateroom and dry socks , he was confronted by Biggs , captain 's orderly . " Captain wants to see you , Mr. Foster . . . . Starboard wing of the bridge . " Bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't change socks while commanding officers wait . Climbing ladders to the bridge , he wondered what the Old Man wanted ? never a good word from him yet . Perhaps this was the day of change . Those two weeks away from the Belinda had been rugged , except for lazy sunbaths the first week out ? air attacks of four big Japs on one poor little LST , then this morning to top things off . Bud found Captain Gedney shouting admonitions through his megaphone to the LST-boat 's crew . " Put your bowfast on the outboard cleat . You 'll never get alongside under the load the way you 're doing it . " Gedney turned to MacDougall , who was at his elbow . " We should n't blame these lads . They do n't get proper training on LSTs , with Bachelors of Art for commanding officers . " MacDougall grinned , then seeing Foster , slapped him on the back and shook his hand . " Welcome home , Bud . " Gedney gave attention to the landing craft until the first slingload of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned and saw Bud . Gedney seemed to be waiting for something . With a start , Bud remembered and managed a salute . Returning the salute casually , Gedney allowed him a benign half smile . " Congratulations on a safe return , " he said . Bud beamed ; a warm , wonderful feeling flowed through his being . " Thank you , sir . " The words breathed out like a relieved sigh . Now the little smile was gone from Gedney 's face . Blue eyes probed into Bud 's . " Ensign Foster , can you explain to me your reasons for holding up the landing on Yellow Beach for eleven minutes ? " Bud 's golden glow was replaced by the old familiar chill . How could a green ensign explain anything to a four striper ? " Well , sir . It was the planes . They kept on coming and I thought that if those soldiers got strafed . . . I thought . . . Well , you see , Captain . . . " Gedney held up his right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick gulp of air which hurt his throat as he tried to swallow . Well , let 's have it , he thought . I 'm really on the Old Man 's list now . " Young man , " Gedney said at last , his tone fatherly , almost kind , " when Admiral Nimitz requires your advice he will send for you . Meanwhile I direct your attention to his operation plan , which required planes to bomb and strafe the beach area until the first wave approached within one hundred yards of the beach , a distance safety  | factor calculated to protect our own assault waves from friendly fire . Those planes were waiting for you to close the beach within one hundred yards . Your delay in landing on schedule held up the entire Yellow Beach landing eleven minutes , thus allowing the enemy to recover somewhat from effects of our naval bombardment . Evidently Providence saved you from the effects of your own poor judgment . " The bridge was very quiet . Thus endeth the lesson , thought Bud . It could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his binoculars . Gedney looked over the side , frowning at the LST 's boat once more . Without turning around , Gedney said , " Get down to your boat now , Foster . It is nearly loaded . When you have delivered the oxygen to Yellow Beach I expect you to board Belinda by first available ship 's boat . " " Aye , aye , sir . " Foster saluted Gedney 's back and ran down the ladder . No time for coffee in the wardroom now , but he was determined to get those socks . He rushed down dark passageways to wardroom country , nearly knocking down a Negro mess attendant , then swung open the door to his room . Kruger was there in salt-stained khakis , strapping on helmet and forty-five . " Hi , Bud . " His voice was friendly but casual . Then Bud remembered that Kruger had made a landing too and was probably just as tired as he . " Just in for chow , Karl ? " " Yep . Got to get back in that boat now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kruger started through the door , then hesitated . " Say , what did the Old Man want ? give you a medal ? " The grin returned to Bud 's friendly face . " Not exactly , but it was the most attention he 's given me since I reported aboard . Up to now I 've never rated more than a dozen words out of him at once . . . . The bearing is moving to the left , not to the right . ' You know the routine ? used to scare me . " " What did you get this time ? " " Oh , he made me kind of proud . After all , it is n't every miserable little ensign that gets to hold up an invasion for eleven minutes . "  | Chapter 11 LIGHT OF D Day was fading and there was no moon , yet over Butaritari Island bright planets burst into temporary being , hung suspended , then drifted gently downward , carried towards the lagoon by a quiet sea breeze . When the last of their parachute-borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns ? completed brief life cycles and gave way to darkness ; yet eerie lights continued , for as each star shell faded , its place was taken by another and yet another . While battleships , cruisers , transports and destroyers formed up for night retirement and steamed away from island battleground , MacDougall watched intently from the Belinda 's bridge . Tropic night came quickly ; outline of Makin Atoll faded into darkness and distance , yet star shells showed the island 's location plainer and further than light of day . The ships zigzagged southward , scheduled to turn at midnight and zigzag back , arriving at dawn off the beaches . Red Beach was cluttered with unloaded boats , waiting while engineers blasted passage for them through the coral . Retirement for the invasion fleet was a prudent tactical move . No more supplies could be landed until the bottleneck at the reef was cleared ; warships could not bombard such a small strip of land without endangering Americans . Several Japanese submarines had been detected by destroyer sound gear . Therefore , with the exception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamed away overnight , while sputtering star shells hovered over men nervous in sandy foxholes . O'Bannion lay in his foxhole , next to that of Major Malumphy , on Red Beach . Star shells floating down from sky like ghostly lanterns illuminated silhouettes of tattered palms . Groups of Japanese marines had been by-passed during the advance from Red and Yellow beaches towards the western tank barrier , an enemy-built defensive line . Others of the enemy had infiltrated the lines ? having the advantage of knowing the terrain intimately , they wriggled and glided through Butaritari 's swampy marshes , moved stealthily from shrub to shrub , from tree to tree , even getting into foxholes occupied by invading Americans . Near Red Beach , some Japanese hid under fallen  | palm fronds , waiting chances for some last , desperate effort . One of them was hidden in an undiscovered machine gun emplacement , watching comings and goings on the beach for hours . At last , hearing movements and hushed voices near at hand , he cut loose with his machine gun . Chattering shots ripped through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sergeant crawled around and flanked the gunner . Well-thrown hand grenades silenced him forever . Now there were voices in the night : fantastic , mocking voices . " Haro , Yank . Haro , haro . . . . Psst ! . . . Hey , Sarge ! . . . Medics ! Send medics ; I die , I die ! " Voices in English  --  English with a Harvard accent ; English with an unmistakable Kobe hiss ; English with r substituted for 1 ? English of snipers , of desperate and disorganized Japanese . Obeying strict orders , Americans gave no reply . They lay in foxholes , dry or swampy according to their luck . Some holes were shallow , carelessly dug during comparative safety of evening twilight . Too late now to dig : any sudden movement , sound or cry brought the crack of a Japanese rifle , even of an American rifle . It was a nervous beach ; sleepless men longed for dawn , for action , for anything except lying still in a sandy ditch where at any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike O'Bannion was a big man . He had prudently dug for himself a big foxhole , and had made sure that every man in his beach party followed his example . O'Bannion and Malumphy had dug a small ditch between their two foxholes so that they could lie facing each other and whisper back and forth . They said little , and most of that concerned the situation and their men . Sherwood had taken all remaining landing craft , most of them still loaded , into the lagoon overnight . Soldiers and sailors assigned to the beach could do little until daylight . Their duty now was to survive the night and rest for the rigors of the second day . After one of the intermittent combinations of cries , movements and rifle shots had subsided , O'Bannion reached across the ditch and poked Malumphy . The major stirred ; O'Bannion could see the outline of his helmet , placed like a sheltering roof over his face . Malumphy lifted the helmet enough to turn his face . " What is it , Mike ? " he whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone . " I had the queerest feeling after we landed this morning . I was looking out at the ships , half hidden in smoke . It seemed as if I had been here before . "  | " You could n't have been here , that 's a cinch . " " That 's what I could n't figure out at the time ? of course I 've seen plenty of islands with coconut trees on them . . . . " " Well , where was it , then ? " " It was the first dry run we made from the Belinda ? back in Hawaii . I got wet working with the boats . . . drying my pants on some driftwood when two staff officers from Pearl came along . I told them what a landing would be like : the ships , the smoke , the men and guns coming ashore . I could see all that ? just see it ! " " Was it like this ? " Malumphy 's voice had a slightly teasing intonation . No foxholes there , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said slowly , " It 's so different at night . Those star shells , that greenish devil 's candlelight ! Does n't it give a man the creeps ? " Clouds hung over battle smoke as the attack on Butaritari went into its second day . Gunfire , moving slowly northward , sounded more distant to Captain Gedney . At dawn he brought the Belinda back to Red Beach . Bathed in bright sunshine , the ship drifted alone in the clearest of blue water . Other transports lay off the lagoon entrance , several miles away , to finish their unloading by way of Yellow Beach inside the lagoon . The Belinda 's winches were busy again , swing-ing combat cargo overside into the boats . Landing craft shuttled between ship and beach . Malumphy 's engineers blasted a small passage through the reef so that boats could get in to Red Beach one at a time , even at low water . Unloading was not going fast enough to suit Gedney , yet as long as some progress was being made he could maintain reasonable calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so maddening . Conning ship , MacDougall took a quick bearing of Ukiangong Point , right tangent of visible shore . The Belinda was close : thirteen hundred yards by last radar check and drifting fast towards the point . Strong current here , but parallel with shore . No danger of going aground , rather that of drifting away from Red Beach so that landing craft had further to run ? and there were Japanese subma-rines reported off the point this morning . He would have to be careful . Bearings indicated the Belinda to be a thousand yards from assigned unloading spot . MacDougall looked over side again : the last of the bulldozers still hung overside while LCM Number Two mancuvered alongside . He decided to hold on a few minutes longer ; if he started up engines and swung the ship back towards assigned position  | now he would throw off the tank lighter and delay that bulldozer , badly needed ashore . The signal bridge bell clanged . The first-class quartermaster answered , " Pilothouse , aye , " listened to the message , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . Orders to take station at once . " " Very well . I 'll get moving as soon as Moran lands that bulldozer in the LCM . . . . Jerk up the helmsman and stand by the annunciator . We 'll move in a minute . " MacDougall 's injured leg ached from the standing required by night-long manuevers . He looked overside . They would soon have that heavy bulldozer in the tank lighter . Turning inboard again he was confronted with the surly face of Ensign Twitchell , the signal and recognition officer . Easily the most unpopular officer in the ship , his protruding eyes seemed to be constantly searching for ' situation of which he could take some advantage . His usual expression to enlisted men was a leer . Even when nearly blank in the presence of his seniors , a trace of sneer remained . Nasty little punk on the make , MacDougall thought now . Wonder what he wants . " Did you get that signal from the flagship , Lieutenant MacDougall ? " asked Twitchell . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I gave you the message four minutes ago . " " Listen , son . You report messages to the bridge . We acknowledge when the message is understood . That 's the end of your responsibility and the beginning of ours . Savvy ? " Twitchell flushed . " You did n't obey that order yet , " he insisted . " I 'm not going to let you or anybody else get me into trouble . " MacDougall pointed into the pilothouse . He shoved his face down toward the signal officer and lowered his hoarse whispering voice until it was nearly inaudible . " There 's a man sitting in that chair in the pilothouse , Ensign . Suppose you go tell him your troubles . " The captain ! Twitchell had thought him down below . The frustrated ensign shoved his lower jaw out sideways and worked it back and forth , then turned his back on MacDougall and climbed the ladder to the signal bridge . MacDougall looked overside ; the tank lighter was gone . He looked at the bearing of the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three minutes more , just to show little Nero who 's running things here , " he muttered to himself . At last he ordered engines ahead and rudder full left . The Belinda 's stern came round and she gathered headway toward her assigned station . Gedney came out to the bridge wing and looked at Ukiangong  | Point . " We 've never been so close to it before , " he remarked . MacDougall did not reply . Now Gedney turned binoculars upon the flagship Pennsylvania , brooding guns temporarily silent , her wide signal yardarm naked of signal bunting . " Two enemy submarines were sighted off the point at dawn this morning , " Gedney remarked casually . MacDougall thought , he knows that I knew that . He 's going to chew me up and down for delaying compliance with orders from the flagship . With a measure of guilt , MacDougall considered those lurking Japanese submarines ; it seemed difficult to picture such menace under this sparkling water , yet of course they might still be there . He had eight surface lookouts constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would probably be too late . Then he thought of Twitchell . Well , let the Old Man chew me . It was worth it ? the ship 's still afloat . Gedney took a sheet of rice paper from his pocket and wiped the lenses of his binoculars carefully . " Many flag officers have a most annoying habit , " he said reflectively . " They put some inexperienced junior on the signal bridge and tell him to keep the disposition on station . Such subordinates have neither navigational experience nor judgment as to relative importance of station-keeping according to plan as against this unloading of combat equipment for which reason only we are here . " Gedney cleared his throat , looked at the battleship once more before adding , " I presume it was some such junior-grade lieutenant who ordered us to take station . Except for straining safety factors , I would be inclined to remain here a little longer . " MacDougall felt relieved . Gedney must have heard what he said to Twitchell , and this was his way of expressing his approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are a seaman , MacDougall , " he said . " I am a seaman . " His words seemed to imply , we see eye to eye on this . Twitchell watched the ship creep up to her assigned position off Red Beach . Landing craft , which had followed the ship like pups running beside a mother dog , were now alongside . Twitchell was angry with MacDougall and looking for a victim among the enlisted men . Perhaps he could put somebody on report , get him some extra duty or loss of liberty . He had been all around his division , but everything was in order . The men were smart enough to see that he meant business this morning . They did n't dare get out of line . There was a little satisfaction in that . Just a little . Twitchell looked over the side . A big sailor was climbing up number three debarkation net from a VP . It was Boski , one of his signal-  | men , on temporary duty with the beachmaster . At the thought of O'Bannion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way he acted , the signal officer did n't have anything to say at all . Well , some day he 'd show him . A few minutes later Twitchell saw Boski on the deck below . He was with one of the radio men , pulling something out of the radio storage locker . Twitchell called out sharply , " Boski . Come up here . " The big signalman straightened up , wiped sweat from his eyes and nodded . Then he lumbered forward , climbed the ladder to the signal bridge and stood before Twitchell . " Yes , sir , " he said . The sir was slurred off almost into nothingness . " What were you doing down there , Boski ? Why did n't you report to me when you came aboard ? " " I was getting out a battery for the beach-party transmitter . The one ashore has gone dead . " " That 's a job for the radioman . You 're supposed to be on shore to take my signals . You had no business to come aboard here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ensign Twitchell . " Is that all , sir ? " He asked the question in the same dull voice . Twitchell sneered up at the signalman ; his lower lip took on a nasty curl . " No , that is not all . Why did you come aboard ? " " Sir , Mr. O'Bannion ordered me to get them batteries . Mr. O'Bannion is a full lieutenant and he is in command of the beach party . I am in the beach party and I do what Mr. O'Bannion tells me to do . " " I 'm the signal officer , " said Twitchell . " I 'm the signal officer . " There was defiance in his tone . That was wrong . Why did he have defiance in his tone to an enlisted man ? It was n't going the way it should at all . Boski stood still without further reply , then turned and started down the ladder to the navigation bridge . " Come back here , Boski , " ordered Twitchell in a dull , flat voice . The hulking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was nine inches taller than the ensign and some seventy pounds heavier . Yet his weight and power did not seem to menace the officer . It was as though Twitchell were standing alongside a seagoing tug of over a thousand horsepower . " Why did you walk away from me like that ? Why did you walk away ? " Twitchell 's voice rose at the end of the repeated question . He was very unsure of his ground . He wished that Boski were back on the beach ? anywhere . But he could not run from this man now , this man who just looked down at him , waiting . " Why did you walk away ? " repeated Twitchell once more . His  | voice sounded like a damaged record ? repeat , repeat  --  why , why ? Boski seldom spoke ; words came hard to him . His mind was deliberate , his speech still slower . It was his body with the big flashing muscles that was fast . He spoke slowly now . " I walked away so I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear swept through Twitchell ; then it passed . Boski would not hit him now . The moment for that had come and gone ; yet the very thought of it weakened him . The power of this man ? the strongest man on the ship  --  this quiet man who hated him . The others hated him . They all hated him . Most of them he could handle . But he was afraid of this Boski . If he could just get something on him . ... But Boski had the cunning of a wild animal . He knew what he could do and say in this Navy . " If I stood there , Mr. Twitchell , when you talked to me like that , I would just flatten you ? I could n't help it . So I walked away . " " But I 'm the signal officer . You disregarded me . " Boski took a deep breath , then placed hamlike palms against his flat hips and looked down again at Twitchell . There were little speckles in his otherwise clear brown eyes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort which could pierce Twitchell , transfix him , make him completely helpless . " You never ordered me to stay , Mr. Twitchell . You order me to stay here now and I 'll stay here as long as you tell me to stay here . " Boski turned around very slowly and walked across the hot steel deck of the signal bridge , his broad back turned to Twitchell . He heard no order to stop , so he continued deliberately down the ladder and out of sight . Chapter 12 LATER THAT SAME MORNING Dr. Flynn was in the surgery , checking the condition of his surgical instruments . The place was spotless and quiet  --  much too quiet . Most of the wounded had been taken to the division flagship . Flynn knew that many of them still waited for attention there while he waited here in his empty surgery , like a barber on a Monday morning . Why did n't they send some of them here ? Was the fleet surgeon trying for a record ? The only casualties brought to Flynn so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Bell . Vinson , the boat coxswain wounded during the landing , was in the sick bay now , well taken care of . Vinson 's little deckhand had been done for . Eight soldiers from Red Beach were resting in clean bunks , wounds dressed , fractures attended to . Then the native from Butaritari ? he was the most interesting of all . Surely never before aboard a ship like the Belinda , he had seemed composed and unafraid , even when the ether mask had been placed over his face . He would recover ? a long pull , but he had both the constitution and the will to survive . Now the surgery was empty again . Restless after a good night 's sleep in his cot on the open boat deck , Flynn picked up an old copy of the Journal of the American Medical Association , scanned familiar pages and tossed it back on the cabinet . He knew that this very moment wounded men waited in litters while he , trained to help them , had nothing to do . I might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependents , he thought . The wide surgery door opened on silent hinges . In rushed heat and sound from the nearby engine-room hatch , together with sticky , oozing heat from inner passageways of a ship becalmed in the tropics . Some voice shouted instructions deep in that devil 's kettle of an engine room . Shut off something . Even while the ship lay dead in the water , pumps thrust and motors hummed , fires burned and steam pressure was kept up : organs functioning in sleep , Flynn thought . His mind twisted thoughts lightly . They were making fresh water from the sea so they could report to Captain Gedney so many thousand gallons on a slip of paper , then turn off the water so that there was none for washing . Of course the crew would get more prickly heat . Send them to Flynn ; he will prescribe for them ? nothing else to do . The door was swinging back and forth with the ship 's lazy rolling . Would these corpsmen never learn to hook a door back ? " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate ? blond head popping in the door , then withdrawing . " Yes , " Flynn answered cheerfully . Another casualty , perhaps ? not that Flynn wanted bodies to operate upon , but if men were wounded , needed attention from trained hands , they might as well bring them to Flynn ? anything but more prickly heat , cat fever , inoculations . " Dr. Flynn ! " Wilkinson again ? excitement in his voice . " What is it , Wilkinson ? " Flynn was getting impatient ? this bobbing in and out . . . " It 's a Jap , Doctor ? a wounded Jap prisoner ! Alvick 's men are picking him out of the boat now . "  | Work to do ? something interesting : a prisoner . How did they capture him ? The stories they told about these Japs : fanatics , dangerous to their last breath . Flynn followed Wilkinson . Sunny out on deck ? morning air fresh . Blinking at sudden light , Flynn found himself at the edge of a milling crowd of men : workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd was at the rail abreast number five hatch . Flynn moved forward into the crowd ; men looked up quickly , enough of them recognizing the doctor and making room for him so that he soon stood at the Belinda 's railing looking down into an LCVP which was alongside . The casualty was in a wire Stokes litter , strapped in so that he could not fall out  --  strapped in so that he could not escape , Flynn realized . This man was an enemy . The prisoner 's body filled the length of the basketlike stretcher . He was tall for a Japanese , dressed in the faded blue uniform of an Imperial marine ? one leg in bloody splints and a large dressing on his head . He seemed groggy ; perhaps he had been struck on the head . Flynn hoped that there was no concussion ? nasty stuff . The wounded Japanese muttered something , moved his right arm slowly back and forth . Excited murmur through the crowd like a puff of wind rippling a still pond . There was feeling here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . It had the feeling of fear  --  ridiculous  --  yet Flynn began to sense it within himself . This was the enemy so long talked of , thought of . Most of these men had never seen a Jap before : back in the States they had them all corralled out in the desert somewhere . This was the enemy feared and hated in an impersonal but in a terrible way . When you came right down to it , here was one of the people who were responsible for this shipload of sweat and bitching ? unfamiliar military life and discipline . Anything a fellow did n't like about the Army or the Navy from here to Kansas you could blame on the Japs . Here was one of them , the first one they had seen . Lashed in a stretcher like that , he just moved his arm and it scared them ? a tiny little fear  --  just nothing measurable in the strength of all these American boys standing under the shadow of their own gun barrels , but it was there . Flynn could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , suddenly brandishing a banzai sword , and leap out at them with some fanatical cry , to kill and die for his emperor ? Alvick was hoisting the prisoner aboard now , his hatch crew well trained at this maneuver . Together with the corpsmen they would get the Japanese to the surgery . Until then Flynn was free to be a spectator . He looked now at the face of this Japanese : thinner than most , nose long for an Oriental , but nostrils typically flat . The thy-  | roid type ? not at all like pictures on the posters at San Francisco , ferocious buck teeth dripping with the blood of a Chinese child . For that matter he did n't look at all like the short , amiable little Japs Flynn had known casually before the war . Something inscrutable about this fellow ? something beyond the shock he was suffering . He seemed to be in another world , remote from this ship and watching crowd as if the soul had already departed the body . Flynn shivered , then shook himself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring of American faces about the stretcher . Curiosity ? that was the key note . It was on all the faces : on the ones which showed derision , on the face of the dark-skinned soldier who spat in hate upon the deck . It was written there in all the faces ? no sympathy that he could see , hate in a few , satisfaction in many , but curiosity in all . Perhaps this was why not a word was spoken , except only the crisp orders of Alvick to winchmen and line tenders . Now the litter was on deck , crowd opening wide , corpsmen watching the Jap 's face at every other step . Into the darkened passageway , stale sticky heat , then the wide surgery door again ? opening , held open for the litter , for Flynn , then closing to exclude some of the heat and some of the excited chatter now crackling through the group of men left outside . Flynn was not alone with the prisoner . Wilkinson and his mates scurried about , getting ready . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery , was scrubbing up at the sink . Flynn 's colleague , Dr. Ezra Gates , getting ready . The only person not in white was the prisoner . His blue uniform was faded and torn , stained from struggle on the island , from sweat and blood . Flynn looked curiously at the man . He seemed to be some sort of officer , probably not very important . The fellow 's ribs protruded and he looked undernourished , though of course he might just be that type ; some of them never fatten up . Cheek bones showed clearly under tightly drawn skin , which was tanned and parched , yet had a slight blush of color under it . Sparse black whiskers stubbled the small chin . Now the eyes opened , just a crack at first , then as wide as they were accustomed to open in their almond frames . Deep brown eyes looking at him . What was it they showed ? . . . Fear ? . . . No . Doubtless enough he was scared stiff , but no trace of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of a treed squirrel looking out from a branch hollow . The wounded prisoner was deep in his shell . It was as if he were looking out at death , had already written himself off . Flynn started . Why , it 's me , he thought . He  | thinks I 'm going to kill him . But why should he ? I wonder if they showed him some posters of us before they sent him out here to Butaritari . The only place where the wounded prisoner could be safely confined , yet properly cared for , was the ship 's insane room , across the passageway from the Belinda 's medical laboratory . Here , behind a locked and barred door , the Japanese had been placed in a comfortable hospital lied . Larry Jordan , on guard outside this door , was getting nervous . It seemed to him that half the Belinda 's crew were crowded into this portside alleyway , hoping to get a look at the captured Jap . It was all right for them to look ? a couple at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so closely . He was n't used to having a loaded gun in his hands and wanted a little space about him . Larry grounded the carbine on the deck and held the barrel in front of him with both hands . " Take it easy , fellows . No use trying to batter down the door . Dr. Flynn has the key . Why do n't you go ask him for it ? " Quieter now , moving forward by ones and twos , curious sailors looked through the glass port . The small room had no other windows . A single electric light in its watertight glass protector shone down from overhead upon the Japanese , who lay on his back in the hospital bed . Enveloped in a heavy plaster cast , his fractured leg was elevated by ribbons of bandage suspended from pipe brackets in the overhead . The prisoner 's head was nearly covered with bandages . He faced toward the door with eyes closed . It was n't much to see . On his way from the stuffy medical office to the wardroom for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped inside . Once more the place was quiet and spotless , even the dog-eared back number of the medical journal had been placed neatly on top of the white enameled cabinet , exactly perpendicular . Flynn reached up absentmindedly and thumbed familiar pages ? new antiseptic procedures ... He tossed the pamphlet back on the cabinet , noting with satisfaction that it now rested at an untidy angle upon the gleaming enamel . Then he heard his name called ? sharply , urgently : " Dr. Flynn . Dr. Flynn ! The keys . . . Come quickly ! " Flynn stepped outside the door just in time to collide with a clean-cut young sailor carrying a carbine . " Quick , Doctor . It 's the Jap . He 's hung himself ! " Flynn reached into his pocket for the key , felt its small hardness between his fingers , then ran forward along the passageway after Jordan . Without waiting to look through the inspection port , Flynn  | unlocked the insane-room door and flung it open . A strip of bed sheet was tied tightly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pipe bracket in the overhead , near the one from which they had suspended the leg . The Japanese marine sagged in the bight of a grotesque arc : bed sheet , then dark head , curved trunk , the buttocks at the curve of the arc , then plaster cast ? uninjured leg hanging free like the tail on a printed letter Q. The Japanese was choking convulsively , gasping for air . " Here , help me ! " cried Flynn . " Lift him here . . . now hold him . " Flynn reached a hand to his belt and pulled from its sheath the knife which every man aboard the Belinda wore constantly , in case of shipwreck or other emergency . With a single quick slash he severed the sheet . " Now hold him up here . " With a second motion he severed the bandage sling suspending the plaster cast . Now the man was free and they lowered him to the cot . His face was sallow and he gasped for breath in a feeble , ragged manner . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpsmen , " Flynn said , " then run to the wardroom for Dr. Gates . " Jordan left the small room with a single bound , glad for relief in action from the despair of an accident allowed by his own momentary carelessness . Flynn could hear his shouts , " Hey , corpsmen , Wilkinson , anybody ? quick ! " Flynn struggled to turn the Japanese over on his stomach . Artificial respiration ? that 's what he needed . But the heavy cast made things awkward , and bedsprings gave under his thrusting hands . The man seemed to be losing out . Now footsteps . Several corpsmen , then big Ez Gates pushing through . " He hung himself with the bed sheet , Ez . He 's near done in  --  needs oxygen . Let 's get him to the surgery . " " Yes , " said Gates . " I 'll take him . " The big doctor gathered the tall Japanese in his arms , plaster cast sticking awkwardly out to his right , and stepped into the passageway , once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " cried Flynn . " Gangway . . . . Clear the way . . . . Stand back , sailors . " Other voices took up the cry . Almost mechanical co-operation , now part of daily routine , took over . Men rushing up out of curiosity turned suddenly and shouted to their mates to stand aside . All who could , retreated , while the rest flattened themselves against the passageway bulkheads . Standing thus , their eyes followed Gates as he edged sideways toward the surgery with a quick , crablike shuffle . Oxygen ! Sudden fact slammed home at Flynn : they had no oxygen !  | All the stuff they had , but not that . " We need oxygen , " he said simply . " I 'll get oxygen , " said a quiet voice behind him . Flynn turned . It was Lieutenant Ingalls , the engineering officer , standing in the doorway to his stuffy log room across from the sick bay . Flynn began to thank him , but Ingalls was already calling over the heads of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bring the oxygen tank with a gauge and hose from boat repair , Jerry . " Satisfied , Flynn stepped quickly into the surgery . Gates had the Japanese face down on the warm steel deck and was astride him , pumping the lungs with his hands . No sign of returning consciousness yet . Rattling and shouts outside the door now opening . Roar of sounds and rush of heat again . A new clatter  --  wheels of a hand truck on the steel deck : the oxygen tank . Flynn gave quick instructions . An emergency tent was rigged over the prisoner 's head and shoulders . Gates turned the man over as oxygen hissed from the rubber hose . Careful watching , then Flynn said , " Pulse is stronger . I think he 's going to make it . " Gates ducked out from the oxygen tent , where he had been making final adjustments and stood up slowly . The breathing was more nearly regular now . Flynn dropped the man 's thin wrist and looked up from his strap watch . " Pulse seventy-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was past . Gates 's mind felt free to roam again in the green valley of his thoughts . Saint or rogue , friend or enemy ? it made no difference to a doctor . Life was the spark they shielded here from winds of circumstance . Until the last inevitable moment when it must die out , they cupped their hands about it . Larry Jordan had been relieved of the guard ; in fact twice relieved , for Chief Maxwell had been instructed to double the guard . When the prisoner had recovered sufficiently to be returned to the insane ward , a constant eye was to be kept at the inspection port , so that any further attempt upon his life could be prevented immediately . Jordan still waited outside the surgery door , his dinner completely forgotten . He knew that word of the attempted suicide had reached the captain . There would be a stink about this and he would be held responsible . He expected to be severely punished for those few minutes in fresh air away from the inspection port . He felt an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest loss of five liberties . With liberty one day out of four while at Pearl ? if the ship ever got  | back that far ? that would mean twenty days confinement while in port . The ship would n't stay in nearly that long ; it might take him six months or even more to work off loss of five liberties . Six months of never leaving the ship in exchange for three minutes in the fresh air . Well , that was just part of life in the Navy . Hawaii and possible liberties seemed remote ; the whole business of punishment was shoved into the back of his mind together with all other unhappiness and frustrations this war had brought him . He waited here to see how the Jap came out ? not that he felt any great sympathy for him , nor any particular resentment for the trouble which the attempted suicide had incidentally brought to him . It was something like sitting in the dugout at a ball game , wondering how your side was going to come out in the last half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belinda 's crew as a team , yet that was really the way he was beginning to feel about it . While Jordan hesitated outside the surgery door , Flynn went to check on the Japanese prisoner . The Jap seemed conscious , but his eyes remained closed . Perhaps he had sunk into an exhausted sleep : sedatives taking hold . Flynn wondered what his thoughts would be when he awoke . Would there be resentment now that death , like freedom , had been snatched from him ? The Jap 's eyes were opening : first those thin slits , then , with cautious acceptance of time and place , dark eyes looked at him without a flicker . Fear , hate , reassurance , gratitude  --  Flynn saw none of these things in the eyes of this enemy whose rejected life had been returned to him . If Flynn saw any emotion at all , it was the complete alertness of the squirrel cornered in his hole . In the stagnant tropics odds are all against any air movement penetrating inside a drifting ship , yet the whim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belinda 's pilothouse a pleasant place . Unrefreshed , nevertheless , Quigley shifted his weight uncomfortably from one well-polished shoe to the other ; he was toasting on the Old Man 's grill and he did n't like it . Gedney glanced briefly at the executive officer , for whom he had sent , took a quick , appraising look at the position of his ship relative to other ships of the task force and to nearby Butaritari , then leaned back in his high seat and closed his eyes . Finger tips pressed together in contemplation , he relaxed momentarily into his innermost thoughts . Quigley stood straight on the balls of both feet and coughed delicately . Gedney remained completely indifferent . I might as well be up in the mountains of Tibet ,  | Quigley thought . His geography was hazy , but that was the most remote place he could bring to mind and he was beginning to think that Gedney would have made an excellent lama . At last the captain sat up , glanced quickly at the horizon , then brought his eyes to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quigley , " he said , " have you ever considered the purpose of your being here in the Belinda ? " Blue eyes were boring into Quigley now . Hunting for a suitable reply , Quigley thought how different this was from sociable conversations in some officer 's club , where he could spread it on a little thick to fellow officers casually met and seldom seen again . This was sharply different ; he stood before Gedney as if naked . Through his mind flashed a series of his insignificant contributions to this ship . He knew that he was not a working officer , and that Gedney was well aware of that fact . Yet there were modesty and personal honesty underlying Quigley 's love of rank and show . He hoped that he did contribute something to dignity and discipline on this ship , if not to the know-how and the sweat . These he could hardly mention here . He knew that Gedney meant something else ? something which he would pronounce when he got around to it ? which would surely have a refined but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gedney 's eyes ; he was ready now with his boiling oil . " You know , Quigley , there has to be a goat for everything . I am the over-all goat for things which go wrong in the Belinda , but you are my executive officer , the specific goat for things which go wrong within the working administration of the ship . " Gedney suddenly pointed to shore . " A battle is going on there against our enemy , the Japanese . In battle we bring everything possible to bear against the enemy : careful planning and rehearsal , ships , men , arms , materiel and military intelligence . All these things are important . Failure of any one brings added weight to the others , possibly failure to the entire effort , at the very least , increased casualties and delay in completing the action . Delay here at Makin may bring increased casualties from the enemy entrenched ashore out there under those coconut trees , from Japanese planes or submarines . Delay here will also hold back release of the combat team now being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarawa . We are nailed down this morning at Tarawa , less than an hour 's flight from here . Our losses there are heavy and mounting . " Quigley shivered . He felt the breeze now , cool against his shirt . Could he be perspiring ? No shower ? water hours . Gedney was put-  | ting a weight on him , a big , remote weight . His connection with it was as yet uncertain , but he knew that Gedney would clarify that . The commanding officer is not to be interrupted . Given time , Gedney never failed to make his point . Gedney stirred in his chair ? some distracting activity in the pilothouse ? his Chinese steward with coffee . Gedney wanted the coffee , but he did not wish to lose the organization of his thoughts , or to break the spell he had thrown like a net about his executive officer . He waved the coffee aside and continued : " In this action we have captured one prisoner . He is obviously an officer and undoubtedly knows much of Japanese strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than gold to us now . By the international agreement of the Geneva Convention , and by unwritten laws of humanity , we are required to attend to his wounds and if at all possible to preserve his life . Beyond all this we must save his life , for by doing so we may save many lives of our own men . " Quigley began to shift from one foot to the other and then back again . Pressure was becoming specific ; Gedney 's finger was pointing . Quigley wished that he could say something , anything , to break this up , but he knew that it would be worse than useless to open his mouth now . He stood quietly , contracting the muscles of his buttocks , feeling the strain , wishing that he were down in the wardroom away from these blue eyes and the inevitable pronouncement of his guilt . " The only prisoner captured was entrusted to the Belinda , " said Gedney . " Here he was allowed to hang himself . " Tempo sharpening , Gedney 's voice went on : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of surrender , in fact they have no word for surrender in their language . Therefore , two things are likely to happen : the prisoner may attempt to take his own life , or he may talk very freely . In the Japanese military organization it is impossible to instruct men not to talk in case of surrender , the possibility of which they refuse to admit . They are victims of their own psychology . Therefore , if we capture a Japanese we must do two things : preserve his life and persuade him to talk . " Jim Randall , who had the deck , stuck his head in the pilothouse door . " Amtrack coming alongside , Capt'n ? some Army officer and a Japanese-American noncom . Might be an interpreter , sir . " " Thank you , Randall , " said Gedney , then turned again to Quigley . " Because an adequate and properly instructed guard was not set by the executive officer of this ship , the prisoner is in no condition to  | talk , even were he inclined to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepared to swing down to the pilothouse deck . Pausing , he transfixed Quigley with all the power of his rank and personality . " Quigley , " he said , " do n't you dare to bring the seaman who had the guard duty up to me at mast . You are the one who should be punished . " Gedney sprang lightly to the deck , absorbed t he shock of the fall with a slight give of his knees and then trotted yuickly out to the bridge wing to watch the amtrack 's arrival . Ignoring obvious snickering from delighted seamen on watch about the pilothouse , Quigley shrugged his shoulders , took a deep breath and headed down toward the wardroom . Well , that 's over , he thought . On his way below , Quigley paused on the boat deck just below lie bridge wing where Gedney stood and looked at the scene below . I'he amtrack muddled alongside and Belinda sailors tossed down bow and stern fasts . A soldier on the amtrack floundered about , trying to secure the clumsy craft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Grasping one , he looked about for some cleat or projection to slip it over , but found none . At last he spotted a pad eye near the craft 's Hunt nose . He managed to pass the line through the pad eye , attempted a hitch , fumbled it and gave up . The amtrack was swept away by the current and , after delays , managed a return approach . By this time the soldier had spotted a paintbrush lying on deck near t he cockpit , dropped there by some careless seaman on the LST which brought the amtrack from Hawaii . A paintbrush landing on Yellow Beach with the first wave ? there it was ! The soldier grabbed it , took up the bow fast and pulled it through the pad eye again . Using the paintbrush handle for a toggle , he secured the amtrack to the Belinda . In spite of his vague knowledge of seamanship , Quigley knew that this maneuver of berthing an amtrack had not come up to Navy standards of smartness . How pleasant now to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wit upon somebody else . Gedney was merely amused . " Look , Quigley , " he called down pleasantly . " The Fuller Brush man has arrived at Makin Atoll . " Then he turned to greet the intelligence officer who had come out from shore to interrogate the wounded prisoner .  | Chapter 13 ABOUT MIDNIGHT OF the fourth night off Makin a loud underwater explosion shook the Belinda . Submarine contact . They would get emergency turns from the flagship . MacDougall swung around to call Gedney , and found the captain already beside him . How that man could move ! " Submarines , " said Gedney . " I 've been expecting them before this . . . . Call battle stations . " TBS orders now : crisp , yet without a trace of excitement . Emergency turn to the left . All ships turned at once , cutting off at an angle from the danger without changing column axis . Two destroyers fell back from the fanlike screen ahead and steamed in figure-eight patterns at high speed , dropping one depth charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a giant hammer . Battlealarm honker called an insistent order to man guns ; boatswain 's mate 's shrill pipe was followed by , " All ha-a-ands , man your battle stations ! " Ship alive with helmet clatter , quick tramp of feet on steel ladders and decks , ready-box covers slammed open , guns loaded quickly in the dark . Another emergency turn to the left ? task force now steaming at right angles to its original course ? ships once ahead and astern of the Belinda now on either hand . Then back right once more : quick , unpredictable changes both left and right to throw off torpedo aim . Exploding depth charges sounded far astern now . " They 've got him in a deep dive now , " said Gedney . " No danger from that one for a while . There must be others about , however . Alert lookouts again , MacL ) ougall . " " Aye , aye sir . . . . Talker . Order to all surface lookouts ... " At last all ships returned to fleet course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour more , then secured from general quarters . Even then he left half the crew at the guns while the other half stood watches or rested . " A gunner in his bunk is absolutely useless in emergency , " he said to Quigley . " That 's right , sir , " answered Quigley , sleepy enough to agree with anything . By four in the morning the Belinda had settled into an uneasy routine . Gedney was back in his chair . While a sliver of moon rose  | fn the east , the disposition zigzagged nervously . Jim Randall had taken over the deck from MacDougall , who sat on the camp cot and looked toward Makin , located on the horizon by three pale star shells . Radar had reported another disposition . Randall came over to the cot to discuss it with MacDougall . " Must be the carrier group , Dave . " " I suppose so . . . . Could n't be anything else . Those emergency turns . . . We ran off to port . Perhaps they ran over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two groups of ships closer together than planned . " " Well , there they are ; we 'll soon be within a mile of them . I hate to call the Old Man . He has n't had much sleep these last four days . " " Why do n't you wait ? The admiral will shove us over if we get too close . " MacDougall had seen carriers underway a hundred times before , vet his curiosity was again aroused . He wondered how they looked now against black of night : planes on deck ready to warm up and take off to relieve the combat air patrol now aloft . It was about time for the carriers to swing back into the wind . He felt the urge to get up and hunt for them with his binoculars , but aching body and fatigue pulled him down . Still he sat on the edge of the cot ; it seemed too much effort to lie down . He gazed vaguely into blackness of sea and horizon , broken occasionally by another star shell over Butaritari . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come and gone . Ile wondered what it was , then heard an explosion , softened somewhat by distance , yet having a different quality of sound from underwater depth charges . There was something odd about it ? something ominous . " Jim , " he called . " Jim , I saw  --  I think ? " A soul-searing flash of sudden flame shot high into the sky . Death ! ... There had to be death in such flame ! Then , as MacDougall watched in awed fascination , sound of a tremendous explosion reached him across water . This was no sharp crack of gunfire ; it was a deep , upthrusting whoom . There was power in it ? power to toss a ship ns an angry bull could toss a man . " They 've got to one of the carriers ! " shouted Randall . " That 's her gas tanks going up ! " Gedney appeared , called crew to battle stations once more . Helmets clattered , TBS shouted sharp orders for emergency turns , calls for help , instructions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigging , ships and flames changed as the Belinda wheeled to each new order for emergency turns . Explosions came fast now . Submarine contacts were reported all about ? destroyers running like niad dogs on the loose , tracking them down , dropping depth charges ,  | eight to a pattern . Randall laughed a nervous laugh stripped of any happiness . " Every whale within fifty miles will be getting it now , " he said . Excitement plain in voices from the flagship stabbing from TBS speaker to anxious listeners on the Belinda 's bridge . Excitement in Gedney 's voice as he conned ship and saw to detailed manning of guns and damage control stations . Ships of the fleet maintained order and discipline ; each group kept careful station , turning together precisely on order . Large ships ? carriers , battleships , cruisers , and transports ? wheeled in response to orders for mutual self-preservation . Destroyers divided among themselves without a moments hesitation three tasks necessary to protect the fleet and to rescue the shipwrecked . Some maintained a tight and orderly screen about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacts ; others ran close aboard the doomed carrier , searching flaming waters for survivors . " " There is no chance in the world to save that ship , " said Gedney . A second terrific explosion rose half a mile skyward : flames bright orange , with flecks and streaks as if ammunition were hurled up to explode while sailing upward in this geyser of fire . Secondary explosions were coming faster now ; there were so many things to explode : planes on the flight deck with full gas tanks and loaded bomb racks , ammunition and bombs in the hanger deck , great storage tanks filled with high-test aviation gasoline , high-pressure steam boilers run out of water , ready boxes filled with high-explosive shells placed at guns all about the ship , powder magazines deep under the waterline filled with tons of explosives ? when those went up it would soon be over . Explosions were getting heavier , more fiercely staccato . New bursts of flame shot higher and still higher . Debris showered from the sky , landing on the decks of the battleship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenses of his binoculars . He knew that nearly a thousand men were aboard the Liscome Bay . Many faced the choice of burning or drowning ; others would meet one fate or both without choice . Nothing but flames ! Could it be possible that men still struggled to put out fire like that  --  fog nozzles spraying red-hot bulkheads , foam pumping to smother burning oil ? Surely not . Pumps and fit-mains would be gone by now . The captain must have given word to abandon ship . What man , pursued by such flames , could humanly wait for an order ? They must be jumping into the sea ? God help them then ! Flames leaped up from the water where oil floated . The fear of sharks with which the Belinda 's crew were so  | preoccupied in idle moments ? where was fear of sharks in the face of fire like this ! Straining through his glasses , MacDougall saw only flames and low black silhouettes of rescuing destroyers hunting for survivors in the flaming sea . Then fore and aft on the dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed than flame could possibly reach . Across water came reverberating thunder . No mistaking that sound ; it was the death agony of a ship . " The magazines , " Gedney said quietly . " She ca n't last much longer now . " As he spoke there was a lessening in the height of the flames . Then the burning hulk rolled over and the flames were quenched forever in the sea . how chilly it was , MacDougall thought . How dark the night ! Not far away hundreds of men struggled for their lives in oily water , drowning , choking on fuel oil which doomed a man once it got into his lungs ? exhausted sailors letting go some hit of wreckage , slipping down . Here was the Belinda , floating high with her life rafts and landing craft , yet he could not pull an oar or throw a line to help them . That was up to assigned destroyers ; Belinda 's duty to keep formation . MacDougall looked to the east for signs of coming sunrise , but all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of three pale star shells hovering over Butaritari Island . At daybreak the Belinda drifted slowly in to Red Beach , hoisting out boats which had been repaired under tarps during the night . Gedney 's voice carried over the PA : " This is our last day here . ' We must finish unloading with all possible speed , then be prepared to reembark troops . " From his bridge , Gedney scanned the horizon for sight of the troop convoy due to arrive : garrison forces to relieve combat teams . There was a single plume of smoke out on the horizon : some ship steaming independently . It was unusual for a ship to steam alone in these contested waters , still more remarkable that she should allow her boilers to send up a smoke signal visible to every enemy periscope within thirty miles . Gedney shook his head , muttering , " Such negligence ! " Then he sighted two destroyers coming in from seaward : undoubtedly the two which had remained behind to pick up survivors from the Liscome Bay . " Biggs , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge . " Standing beside Randall on the bridge , Flynn waited impatiently for the destroyers . He had been up since five o'clock , getting his surgery and sick bay ready for a flood of casualties . He had abundant  | stocks of plasma and surgical dressings , and two excellent surgeons to assist him , for Dr. Bell had just returned from the beach . Flynn accepted a pair of binoculars from Randall and , after a little fumbling , got them focused on the nearest destroyer . It moved slowly , low in the water , weighted down with its burden of wounded sailors . The rescued were crowded in every feasible space : gun tubs , turret tops , scuttles and depth-charge racks . Standing with bandaged heads and arms , sitting , lying in litters ? bandages , bandages , fuel oil-streaked bodies . " Look at them , Jim , " said Flynn . " Burns , lots of burns . Shock , too . Look at those fellows wrapped in blankets , jackets , anything . This climate : sun shining warm again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sure messed up with fuel oil . " " Yes , fuel oil kills more than drowning , once they hit the water . If it is n't burning they inhale it while they struggle in the water , or at least swallow a lot . Effects last for months ? sometimes slow death . I was reading just yesterday in the medical journal  --  battle experience at . . . Well , never mind now , Jim . I 've got to go down and get all set for these fellows . " After the destroyers entered the lagoon , Gedney raised his binoculars again to take a long look at the single approaching vessel which had been smoking so heavily . Masts and funnel showed well above the horizon now . The angle of her approach as she also headed for the lagoon disclosed large red crosses painted on snow-white sides . " A hospital ship , " he said . " Of course . . . . What other type would blow tubes in broad daylight out here in the forward area ? " Robinson , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message , which Gedney read , initialed hurriedly and said , " Route this to the medical officer at once . " Flynn signed the message board , took his copy and closed the surgery door . Leaning against the sterilizer , he read the pink action slip , then without comment passed it to Bell , who was checking surgical instruments . Big Ezra Gates turned from the porthole , where he had been watching destroyer masts moving on the opposite side of a thin coconut grove . " What is it ? " he asked . " We 've been robbed , " said Flynn . " A hospital ship is coming to take all the casualties . " " All of them ? ? I mean , at once ? Just think of it ! " Gates exploded . " All those men : wounded , burned , gasping for breath , suffering from  | shock ? lying on litters for hours , waiting turns . . . . Here we are with nothing to do ! " Bell spoke now , softly , although his surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful , tiny squares : " Take it easy , Ez . You never can tell . Perhaps they 'll send us another prisoner to work on . " Ensign Karl Kruger looked over his shoulder at the six VPs bobbing in the wake of his lead boat , as he came alongside the nearest destroyer . An officer in oil-stained khakis , wearing web belt and forty-five , hailed him in a tired and casual voice . " You for the casualties ? " " Yes , sir . Want me to bring my boats alongside now ? " " Not yet . I 'll hail you . Paper work for the transfer is n't ready yet . " Kruger raised his hand but made no other reply . " Ease over with the other boats , Tommy . " Jones gunned his motor briefly and surged close to the other six boats . " What 's the papers for , Mr. Kruger ? " " They have to keep track of everybody . Every ship in the Navy logs you over the side , coming and going ? you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's right , Tommy . They got to find out who the survivors are . That hospital ship is n't anchored yet . We 'll get ' em over there . " Kruger looked at the hospital ship 's gleaming sides , then back to the dark gray destroyer , waterline stained with fuel oil from the lost carrier , decks crowded with men in oil-soaked dungarees , many bandaged extensively with white surgical dressings which contrasted strangely with their filthy bodies and clothing . " I 'll bet that DD 's doctor is busy , " he said at last . " One doctor and about three corpsmen to handle all those casualties . " " Yes , but you 'd think they 'd give them a little water to clean up with . " " Where are you going to get the water on a little old can ? They have n't got it , Tommy . " Rattle of chain sounded across the lagoon : hospital ship anchoring . Kruger looked impatiently at the destroyer  --  they should have those orders now . Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper work ? " I wonder how many filing cabinets went down with that carrier , " he mused aloud . " What 's that , sir ? "  | " Oh , nothing . I was just thinking about the forests . " " Sir ? " Kruger grinned . " They say those guys in the north woods are cutting down the forests to make paper so we can fight a war . When all the trees are gone we 'll run out of paper , and then the war 'll be over . Ca n't fight a modern war without carbon copies of everything . " " Oh , " said Jones , uninterested now . Mention of paper had taken his mind to San Diego and his wife . " I 'd sure like to get a letter from Lorraine . " " Ahoy , Belinda Seventeen , " hailed the destroyer 's O.O.D. " Bring your boats alongside now . " Kruger took his boat in first . Sailors at the destroyer 's rail tossed lines . Quickly , gently , the wounded were lowered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat , fellows , " Kruger cried urgently . " Do n't let her bump the side now . " Many hands were thrust out from the low-lying destroyer and from the boat ? more hands than were really needed . Sympathy and curiosity showed in young faces ? voices of advice and encouragement . " Watch out , you donkey . You 'll knock his brains out against the side . " " Gim me that steadying line , Mac . Give it here . " " Easy up there , take it easy . " Kruger looked at the first casualty . Swathed in white bandages , he looked more like mummy than living man : head wrapped round and round with gauze , eyes and cheeks covered , only broad , short nose and swollen , cracked lips exposed and shining in the sun under a thick coat of petrolatum . Jones had forgotten about San Diego and mail . Staring in horrified fascination , he thought : he looks like a boiled lobster ? what you can see of him . Then Jones trembled : from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-tier bunk in compartment three-ten . Those dirty Japs ! This could happen to the Belinda  --  to him personally . He might never get back to Lorraine again  --  might be drowned under a huge puddle of oil , going down to the sharks . " Come on there , Tommy ! Watch your boat ! " Jones nodded to Kruger and jumped to his controls , spun his rudder over and kicked ahead to ward off the thrust of a passing LST 's bow wave . Seven other litters were quickly lowered into his boat ? arms and legs strapped in gauze-covered splints , but fuel oil still staining injured limbs . They had n't had much time . One young kid , who also had heavy dressings around his belly and groin , groaned continuously , screaming in pain when his litter was jerked or bumped . Tommy yearned either to be  | able to help him in his agony or to slap him quiet like the others . Most of them just lay in the litters , staring at blue sky , tanned faces drained of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt . Something strange and distant about these wounded fellows , Tommy thought . They seemed so far away from everything , but when they yelled in pain it made you want to just kill somebody ? Japs or somebody . Somebody started all this ? he never could figure just how , but they could n't tell him this was right . When the boat was loaded , Kruger nodded to Jones and they shoved off for the hospital ship , giving place to another VP at the destroyer 's side . The DD 's officer-of-the-deck had not given the customary naval order  --  perhaps it seemed superfluous to him . They just shoved off with their wounded . White sides of the hospital ship soon blanked out lagoon and other ships . Jones brought the boat alongside a wide ramp , lowered exactly to water 's edge . Navy corpsmen in spotless white ran down the ramp , grasped handles of the first litter and , moving in perfect unison , swung it out of sight into the hospital ship 's spotless interior . Contrasted with the babel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded were received here in silence , so that they seemed to lose any trace of remaining personality . " These pharmacist 's mates must have had plenty of practice , " Kruger said to Jones as the last litter was swept up the ramp with a muscular co-ordination which seemed nearly mechanical in its perfection . Faces of the hospital ship 's crew were expressionless , as if they were taking aboard so many bundles of ship 's laundry . " Shove off , Tommy , " said Kruger . Now a chief pharmacist 's mate hurried down the ramp . " Where are the orders to cover these men ? " he asked . " I just brought them over from that can , " Kruger said . " But we must have orders . " " That can did n't wait for orders when she picked them out of the water . . . . They mentioned paper work over there . I guess you 'll get your orders all right . " The chief regarded Kruger with a pained expression , as if he had failed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kruger looked across the water : widely spaced landing craft coming from each anchored destroyer towards the wide ramp and efficient litter bearers . This chief ? probably from some big base hospital ? he 'd learn . " All right , Tommy , " Kruger said , " let 's go back for another load . "  | Chapter 14 FIVE DAYS AFTER the first landing , soldiers from the battle line returned suddenly to the Belinda . In a matter of minutes boats loaded with them swarmed about the lowered nets . They climbed aboard slowly , like men who were very tired , who no longer felt a life and death necessity for sudden action . One young private paused at the top of the debarkation net , hands resting on the Belinda 's rail . He was not wounded , but seemed near the point of exhaustion , feeling that the last steps over the railing were too much , that he would lose his grasp and fall back into the boat far below . Men in dungarees reached out and helped him . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them asked . If the young soldier heard , no reaction showed in his mud and sweat-stained , unshaven face , in glazed , staring eyes focused far beyond the Belinda 's beam as if still searching for another hidden foxhole . Once over the rail , he paused with feet planted wide while other soldiers in helmets and stained fatigues worked around him in the patient , yet insistent manner of closely packed troops . The private waited for nearly a minute , shoulders hunched , weighted by some unseen burden much heavier than pack , rifle or the helmet which seemed to thrust his neck down between his shoulder blades . At last he shuffled aimlessly onward , moving whichever way he was pushed until lost in the crowd 's anonymity . A squat LCT chugged alongside number three hatch , bringing several hundred troops from inside the lagoon , together with an enormous pile of khaki duffel bags . Pappy Moran jumped up from the hatch and called to his men . " Stand by your winches , Prosser . Slack away on that midships guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . . . . Get hot , sailors . Drag that cargo net aft . . . . No , not there . Get it under the hook . Let 's get loaded and out of here ! " Roy Alvick , leading petty officer in the second division , wiped perspiration from his face with a soggy handkerchief . It was uncomfortably hot in compartment 212 , where humid air now carried the earthy smell of island soil and vegetation , mixed with strong odors of stale sweat . Alvick was anxious to get bunk stanchions set up over the covered square of number five hatch , so that he could send his  | tired men to chow . A large pile of duffel bags lay in the hatchway where bunks must go . The tall boatswain 's mate looked about the compartment until he spotted a gray-haired man wearing the chevrons of a first sergeant informally painted in black on the sleeves of his fatigues . Alvick walked over to the top sergeant . " Know who this gear belongs to , Sarge ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Will you get ' em to move their gear out of here ? We 've got to get these bunks set up . " The sergeant spoke with an air of finality . " No , I ca n't do that . " " Listen , Sarge . . rising irritation in Alvick 's voice . " My men are late for chow already ? we 've got to get these bunks set up . Where are the men these bags belong to ? What are they doing ? " " They 're dead . " " Oh . . . . I 'm sorry . " Alvick crossed the hatch to a group of his men . " Come on , sailors . We 've got to move these bags . " The ship 's galley was uncomfortably hot , but steam-laden air was fragrant with cooking juices : chicken and the last fresh vegetables , so-called , which Shadow Rockwell , ship 's commissary officer , had saved especially for this occasion . Passing through the galley , the rotund Rockwell paused to inspect roast fowl coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat shriveled but carefully cooked vegetables being ladled from a long row of shiny steam kettles . " Them soldiers had better like this , " he said to Rostelli , the watch supervisor . " We 're really putting on a feed . I know they ai n't had anything like this to eat up in the line . " Rockwell continued forward into the crew 's mess hall . Tired soldiers in filthy jungle-green jumpers and trousers , stubbled with four days ' beard , hands and faces still dirt and sweat smeared , moved slowly along in a twisting serpentine , down ladder from the weather deck and around dish-washing machinery to the line of steam tables . Here Navy mess cooks , dressed in clean white undershirts above working dungarees , served dinner cafeteria style , each soldier moving along with his Monel-metal mess tray while suitable indentations were filled with large portions of Rockwell 's offering , topped off with homemade ice cream and a steaming mug of coffee . Hundreds of battle-worn soldiers ate at mess tables reaching athwartships to ship 's sides from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after the other , making  | certain that there was plenty of food , and noting how it was being received . Quite at home with fellow officers in the Belinda 's wardroom , Rockwell nevertheless spent very little time there . He ate a tremendous amount of food in the course of a day , accumulation of numberless samples of nearly everything prepared by his cooks . Sometimes he sat down to eat , but this was usually to rest his feet , the food he took on such occasions was merely a snack to top off prodigious amounts consumed while on his rounds . Rockwell stopped at one of the mess tables . A dark-complexioned soldier sat at the end . He might have been thirty or forty  --  nothing whatever of youth in his face . He gulped down chicken and potatoes with cream gravy in large mouthfuls , yet not paying the slightest attention to what he was eating ; his dark eyes were focused upon the mess table about a foot beyond the edge of his plate . A much younger soldier sat at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tufts of brown fuzz stubbling a dirt-smudged face . His fatigue jacket , like his hands and fingernails , was black with ashes from crawling in some burned ruin ashore . Cupped between filthy hands he held a thick porcelain soup bowl a few inches from pursed lips in a sort of frozen motion , while blue eyes stared fixedly at the broth . A third soldier sat opposite the boy . Naked to the waist after an unsuccessful attempt at washing , he had long , flat muscles ? a St. Christopher seal hung , together with dog tags , about his neck . He was tough , aggressive looking  --  reckless face , large , straight nose and lips which looked as if they could be cruel . No passion showed in his face now ? no humor , no interest in the busy mess hall , no interest in food . He was looking very intently across the table at the young soldier 's face , remembering the battle ? that time the kid covered him when he stuck his neck out at the wrong time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant way the kid threw that grenade  --  blasted that Jap sniper out of his concrete cistern . Relive the hour , the minute . Breathe slow , glad to live . Preoccupied with food , Rockwell nevertheless detected communion and comradeship between these three . Wishing only to be friendly , he raised his voice above the clatter of mess gear , shouts of mess cooks ? just enough to be heard . " How 's the chow , fellows ? " No reply ; the three soldiers did not seem aware of his presence . Rockwell was a warmhearted man , usually patient . He repeated his question in a somewhat louder voice without losing a trace of good nature . " How 's the chow , fellows ? ... Chicken all right ? " Still no answer ; none of the three moved his gaze so much as one inch . Rock-  | well began to feel ignored ; with anger in his voice he fairly shouted at them , " What 's the matter with the chow ? " The tough-looking soldier turned his face very slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chow ? " he asked . " Oh , the chow 's all right . . . . I guess . " Then he turned slowly back and resumed staring at the kid across the mess table . Combat troops nearly all aboard ? it would soon be time to go . The attack force would leave four graveyards behind , three of them named by men who had fought for possession of Butaritari , then helped bury the dead . Massed artillery had been dragged from Ukiangong Point . The cannon were now replaced with neat rows of graves . One of the burying detail had named it Gates of Heaven Cemetery . Just under the trees behind Yellow Beach , twenty-one soldiers were buried in Sleepy Lagoon Cemetery , this name also suggested by one of the men who had stacked rifles and taken up shovels . The boatswain of the Alcyon and one of his sailors had died of wounds after making a run in a tank lighter on the hulks within the lagoon , answering Japanese sniper fire with two machine guns mounted on their craft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the opposite side of the lagoon entrance from Flink Point . There are no valleys on Makin and no point of Kotabu rises higher above the sea than the shoulders of a tall man , yet a beachparty sailor from Ohio straightened up from smoothing a mound over the boatswain and said , " Let 's call this place , Happy Valley . " The fourth burying place received no name other than the one which marked it on battle maps , and no shovels were used for the interment . Fifty natives labored willingly under an Army major and a Marine captain , succeeding after two days ' work in burying less than one third of hundreds of Japanese dead . Unattended bodies decomposed rapidly in warm , moist air , endangering lives of natives and of 1arrison forces who would remain on the island . It was therefore decided to collect these bodies and to bury them in a common grave . The West Tank Barrier , a major link in defensive intrenchments dug by Japanese months earlier , was considered best suited to this purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces carried out the post-combat treatment plan , which entailed disposing of fecal matter and collapsing and sealing with bulldozers all enemy shelters which might contain undiscovered dead and cause an epidemic . Thus , many Japanese were buried without being seen or counted .  | " Look at ' em . . . . Look at'cm .... Japs ! " Word passed from mouth to mouth along the Belinda 's afterdeck . In less than a minute the rail at number five hatch was crowded with sailors and re-embarked troops , each man shoving and worming his way outboard to get a better view of the tank lighter tossing in choppy water alongside . " Stand clear , men . . . . Gangway . . . . Give us room to work . ... " Great hook lowered overside ... thirty-six ton craft plus load hoisted to the rail . Suddenly watchers aboard the Belinda were confronted with fiftyone stocky little men , dressed in new dungarees and blue chambray shirts . Few watching Americans realized that these were not Japanese combat troops or Imperial marines , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge on what was ever after called Saki Night ? but Korean laborers , brought here to help build fortifications . With excited comments , watchers on board tried to reconcile these docile , moonlike faces with their previous conceptions of a leering , buck-toothed enemy . " Kin them critters fight ? " one soldier exclaimed in amazement . " Well , you been ducking bullets , ai n't you ? " " Yes , but ? well , just look at ' em ! " The prisoners were guarded by a single squad of infantrymen who watched their charges carefully while at the same time feigning casual indifference for the benefit of spectators . Guards nodded to the prisoners , indicating the rail . The Koreans clambered meekly over and were herded through the curious crowd on the Belinda 's afterdeck . A lanky corporal poked at one of them experimentally . " Show me your buck teeth , Joe , " he said . It is unlikely that the prisoner understood English words ; perhaps with a feeling of relief at unexpected lack of hostility he complied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner started forward after his fellows , passing an American with a hard , unsmiling face . " Smile , you yellow belly , " said this soldier , spitting out the words bitterly . " You 're lucky you are n't stinking like the rest . " All Japanese remaining on Makin were not dead . Small unorganized groups still survived ? some hiding in undiscovered holes , others having fled by night to smaller , uninhabited islands of the atoll . Garrison forces would be occupied for weeks in discovering and subduing them . Due to communication difficulties and to Japanese combat psychology , it was almost impossible to persuade them to surrender . On the day before his death , the executive officer of Japanese forces wrote in  | his diary , " Today looks like another clear day . I feel like singing a song . There is a breeze coming from the northwest . I hope the tanks wo n't come today so that I can rest my bones in peace . " Bright-colored bunting snapped up and down from signal yardarms as transports formed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers , battleships , cruisers and destroyers remained behind to protect the new American garrison from counterattack , or to strengthen the difficult offensive at Tarawa . Only one battleship accompanied the transports now . The Mississippi , damaged by a turret explosion during the bombardment which killed forty sailors , steamed quietly abeam of the Belinda , all her fourteen-inch guns leveled at the horizon save the crippled one , which pointed up at lowering clouds like a sore finger . Captain Gedney sat in his high seat watching the station keeping of Mike O'Bannion , who now had the deck . Gedney began to feel drowsy . The watch had been set and the ship was settling down again into the pleasant monotony of sea routine . There was finality in he steady pulsing of her engines , as if they knew that two thousand miles of open sea lay between Butaritari and Pearl Harbor . Gedney settled himself more comfortably in his high seat and soon began to snore . Chapter 15 " IT 'S RIGHT thinking will turn the bullets aside , Flynn , You 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mopped at sweat trickling down his hairy chest with the limp ends of a damp bath towel which hung about his neck . Air in the Belinda 's officers ' quarters was clammy and stifling . Steel hackers dogged tight over portholes not only contained light within the ship from enemy prowlers without but also prevented the slightest trace of fresh air from entering . A feeble breath of hot , machineprocessed air struggled from an opening in the overhead pipe which theoretically provided ventilation to the place . Dressed in his capacious undershorts , O'Bannion was seated without the slightest loss of dignity upon the closed toilet seat in the small head common to the room which he shared with MacDougall and also to the one adjoin-  | ing , which was shared by Dr. Flynn and the ship 's languid dentist , Dr. Newth . Chairs were available in both narrow rooms , but O'Bannion preferred the toilet seat ; with doors hooked open on either side , it gave him a commanding position and the desirable feeling that he was presiding over this informal gathering . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needle point chair cover he was making . Dr. Flynn , also stripped down to his shorts , sat at his desk in front of a photo of his wife and two children , writing a letter which could not possibly be mailed for several weeks . The skinny frame of Dr. Newth , or The Body , as he was known in the wardroom , was stretched out limply in the lower bunk , naked and breathing with utmost economy of effort . MacDougall , recently down from the bridge , sat at the small foldup desk in the other room , legs extended and feet resting on top of the wastebasket . With occasional pauses to rub aching muscles of his game leg , sore from the constant standing required on the bridge , he was thumbing through pages of a bulky operation plan , getting a final check on details he would need during assault landings to be made on Kwajalein Atoll , now some two hundred miles away . After a final look at diagrams of the transport area off Red Beach One , MacDougall closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's that , Mike ? " he said , joining in the conversation . " What are you going to bend the bullets with ? that fancy bit of needlework you 've got there ? " O'Bannion shoved his needle carefully through the center of a pink rosebud he was just completing , then held up the needle point , regarding it admiringly . " One more to go and I 'll have enough for every chair in our living room . . . back in Boston . " Placing the needle point carefully across his hairy knees , O'Bannion wiped his face on the towel ends . Without the slightest trace of a smile on his face he looked MacDougall in the eye . " Kwajalein is going to be hell on the beach , Mac , but I 'll stand there with shot and shell flying about me , just as safe as I am in this head . I 'll keep my thoughts right and the bullets ca n't hit me ; they 'll be swerving to left and right but not one of them will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly at MacDougall , in a dramatic curving motion which barely missed his nose . " See , " he said . . . . " Just like that ! The bullets will never hit you if you keep thinking right . " " That 's downright decent of you , Mike , " said Flynn . " If this heat keeps up 1 wo n't feel like performing any avoidable surgery . " MacDougall got up from the desk , passed through the two doors  | of the head and sat down beside Flynn . It had been much cooler on the bridge , but things were tense up there and the strain wore on a man . The attack force in which the Belinda now sailed was many times larger than the one in which they had gone to Makin . They were now steaming between Japanese-occupied Marshall Islands for the attack on strongly defended Kwajalein in the largest amphibious operation in the Pacific to date . Menace electrified the air ; some Jap disposition would surely jump them . The ship was steaming in Condition Two : four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars peeking between cotton-cumulus clouds seemed false , out of place . Surely if a man looked hard and long enough there must be something lurking in this darkness . . . . If you could only see it ; that was the trouble . Nothing to be seen all around the horizon save two hundred ships , large and small , moving along together in precise formation . Hot down here in the room , yet good to be able to rest and to kid along with fellows like Flynn and O'Bannion . A double knock sounded on the door leading into the passageway . The door opened sufficiently to admit shoulders and one arm of Steve Sherwood . " The exec wants to see all officers in the wardroom at once , " he said quietly . " What 's up ? " asked MacDougall . " I do n't know ? something about the operation , I think . " Sherwood indicated the prostrate dentist with a long index finger . " Is it alive ? " he asked . " I 'd have to make an examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and poked the dentist experimentally . " Yes , it breathes ; nevertheless , I think we 'd better leave the body here on detached duty . " O'Bannion and Flynn pulled on khaki trousers and shirts , for Quigley would not allow officers in the wardroom unless fully dressed , then followed Sherwood and MacDougall into the passageway , leaving the sleeping dentist in his bunk . Fans in the wardroom merely stirred the humidity . Supper and sunset battle stations were long over and , except for one large pile of uncensored letters , mess tables were bare . In the alcove lounge , comfortable chairs , upholstered in imitation leather , overflowed with perspiring officers in limp khaki . Many who could find no seat , or armrest to do for a seat , squatted on the deck , resting their backs against bulkheads or knees of fellow officers . A small record player lashed in a corner of the alcove was trying to maintain even rotation against the ship 's slow rolling . The tune came out faster and higher , then  | slower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Ensign Gene Cooper had picked up in Honolulu during dry runs for this operation ? a clear , leisurely voice singing , " Oh , What a Beautiful Morning . " MacDougall looked about quickly ? the exec had not yet arrived ? then walked over near the record player and leaned against the bulkhead , beside Dr. Bell . Cooper sat across from them , listening carefully , eyes distant and soft . Bell winked at MacDougall . " Pretty stuff , " he said . The record player was struggling with " The Surrey with the Fringe on Top " when a feeling of alert expectancy came over the wardroom . Someone shut off the music and officers came slowly to their feet . Lieutenant Commander Quigley stood inside the doorway , smiling in a light and friendly way . He seemed pleased about something ? had not even noticed that Robinson , the communications officer , was wearing carpet slippers and enlisted men 's white socks . " Gentlemen , " said the executive officer , " the captain has sent me to ask for volunteers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place , ventilation blowers plainly heard . No immediate response ... . Quigley smiled in a tight-lipped way . " Why , gentlemen , remember the Alamo ? are n't you all going to volunteer ? " " What 's the job ? " asked Sherwood . " Some bright lad to capture the island singlehanded so the rest of you can go home for thirty days leave ? " Quigley coughed . " Not exactly . It 's a little reconnaissance mission . As you know , available charts of this area are very poor . Little is known about actual beach conditions . The public is indignant over heavy losses at Tarawa . Kwajalein must be captured and the landing operation must not be fouled up . " " Somebody go get a flag and wave it a little , " growled a dour voice at the back of the group . Quigley looked towards the speaker : Fraser , ship 's first lieutenant . These Merchant Marine reserves were always needling him , forever ramming their confounded seamanship down his throat and annoying him with caustic remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about it ; they growled , but they produced . Yet sometimes he thought that it would be nice to have a wardroom completely filled with respectful young ensigns . Quigley tried again , his words so well rehearsed that they sounded almost memorized , like the chatter of a green salesman ? giving the impression that he did not have the slightest knowledge of what he  | was talking about . " Four attack transports , the Belinda among them , have been instructed to each equip an LCVP and to recruit a volunteer crew to take it through the surf off Beach Red , examine the reef and plot optimum boat channels into the beach . As you all know , the main landing will be made on D Day plus One . The reconnaissance on the main beach will be made tomorrow , D Day , at fourteen hundred . The captain has instructed me to ask for officer volunteers . He will then select one from the list . This officer will take charge of the Belinda 's reconnaissance boat and will select his own boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoying the element of drama . Then he said , " All volunteers please step forward . " MacDougall stepped forward at once . " I 'll go , " he said . Here at last was a chance to get away from the ship again , to go on his own and have a little adventure . He was thoroughly trained for this sort of thing ; of course they would pick him from the group of volunteers . Then he noticed that it was very quiet in the wardroom ; no one else had stepped forward . This amazed MacDougall at first . What was the matter with them ? did n't they want a little fun ? How many times had he read about things like this ? The Alamo ? a hundred other places . . . Everybody was supposed to volunteer ; but these guys did n't want to go . Were they scared ? Then he began to realize that there was another reason . They were n't trained navigators . It was n't fear of Japs but prospects of having to chart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand alone in front of them all . If only one more would step out , he would feel much better . Quigley coughed again . " Anyone else , gentlemen ? " The silence became uncomfortable . He tried to assure them , " Actually there will be very little danger . " One of the officers snorted derisively , " Broad daylight ? no danger ! " Quigley was not quite sure who it was , but he suspected Hall , the gunnery officer . Speaking more quickly now , as if anxious to assure all present that there were no grounds for apprehension , Quigley added , " Oh , I know that the beach is strongly fortified with artillery and machine gun emplacements , but our battleships will be off at one side , pouring a withering fire along the beach . The Japs will be nailed down completely . " " Why do n't you go , if it 's all so simple ? " asked Fraser . Quigley was beginning to get angry . He wanted to shout at Fraser that the executive officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would only make him appear more ridiculous than ever . He knew that he was the kind of officer who could always be spared . They would n't even miss him . Well , he had to say something . He said , " I was n't asked . I was sent by the captain to ask you gentlemen . " " I do n't want to go , but I 'll go if I 'm sent . " It was Ensign Tony Brooks , Sherwood 's assistant boat commander . Popular with nearly everybody on board , he was capable to the full limit of his knowledge and experience . " A brave and honest young man , " said Sherwood . MacDougall and Brooks grinned sheepishly at each other . Quigley waited a moment longer . Then , without another word and as if triggered off by some invisible force , he leaped through the blackout screen and ran up the ladder to the cabin . The atmosphere in the wardroom remained awkward . Some of the officers stepped over to the coffee maker and began to pour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full cup towards him . His head was buzzing with the excitement of the prospect ahead ? gear he would need , men he would want with him . Cooper walked over to the record player , reached for the " Scheherazade " album , weighed it in his hands and put it back on the shelf unplayed . Then Quigley returned as suddenly as he had left . " Brooks , you are to go , " he said . MacDougall banged his cup on the mess table , spilling the coffee . He rushed up to Quigley . " What 's the matter with me ? " he asked , anger rising together with disappointment in his voice . " Why wo n't he let me go ? " " He said he ca n't spare you , " Quigley said casually . " He said he needs you on the bridge . And then , there 's your leg . You 're still crippled up , you know . " " Baloney ! " MacDougall spat the word out at Quigley . " What 's he need me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigator up there , and there 's Randall . As for the leg . . . if I can climb the ladder to the bridge , I can swing a leg over the rail into a boat , ca n't I ? " " The captain says he needs you . " Quigley was glad that somebody else was uncomfortable and angry ; it helped him to regain his composure . He had said his piece . It was as if he had washed his hands of the whole business ? as if , so far as he was concerned , the thing was as good as done . He had passed the captain 's word along . Now it was up to subordinates . " I 'd like to speak to the captain , " said MacDougall . " Go right ahead . You have my permission . "  | MacDougall limped out of the wardroom and hurried up the ladder to the cabin . The door was hooked open as usual ; a gray curtain hung across the entrance , swaying sedately with the ship 's movements . MacDougall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , calm , unruffled , reached out to him from within . MacDougall stepped inside . Gedney sat at the conference table which dominated the cabin . A precise arrangement of Navy manuals , bound operation plans , maps and charts covered the table , radiating efficiently from a large sheet of clean , white paper placed in front of the captain , upon which he had been making notations in his clear , extremely neat handwriting . MacDougall mentally compared this with the crumpled , sweat-stained notes which he had taken from a similar set of plans . Faint hopes of going in the boat , engendered by rushing up to the cabin to appeal the decision , began to fade . Gedney looked up from his notes and regarded him with his most benign smile . " Yes , MacDougall . What is it ? " " The boat , Capt'n . I want very much to take that boat . " " I 'm sorry , MacDougall . I ca n't let you go . Almost any of the others , but not you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship ! They ca n't be expected to go out in a heaving VP , where everything is confusing , and still plot an accurate chart of the beach . You know I 've navigated ships for years , Capt'n ? taught navigation too ? but this will be tough , even for me . " Gedney smiled . " I 'll tell you a secret . " Pointing his fountain pen , he said in a low voice as if imparting information of an extremely confidential nature , " Do you know , MacDougall , I would very much like to go myself . I think it would be fun . But I ca n't go , and I need you , so you ca n't go . Brooks will have to do the best he can . But I 'll tell you what I 'll let you do , " he said , smiling like a mother promising candy at another time . " You may go down and take charge of preparations . Get a good crew for Brooks , procure or have made any equipment you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " MacDougall 's heart sank . There was no higher appeal for him ; he could not go . He could not go but he could do all the dirty work . He began to get angry all over again , reaching here and there in his mind for some new argument which might change the captain 's decision . He looked at Gedney , busy once more with his operation plans , putting down neat lines of notes in that bold but tidy handwriting . MacDougall felt the chill and disappointment of failure . He was dismissed ; orders were orders . Without another word he left  | the cabin and went down to get a volunteer crew for Brooks . At least , he thought , the Old Mali was honest about it . He did n't throw that bum leg at me . It seemed as if all the enlisted men wanted to go . They shoved and pushed each other , trying to work forward through the crowd in the mess hall where MacDougall stood . Among them he saw faces of men he liked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some of them would go but he could not . This was so different from the wardroom . These fellows in dungarees wanted to go , while officers , who were supposed to be leaders , hung back . " Hot dog ! Let me through , boys . I want to see my little slanteyed friends on the beach ! " Lew Doyle , rangy cowboy from Texas , now Alvick 's righthand man in the second division , pushed to the front of the crowd . " Do n't forget me , Mr. MacDougall . I do n't want to miss out on this . " It was just a ride to these boys . They were eager to help all they could , but it would not be their responsibility to find channels and spot potholes in the reef off Red Beach One , or to plot them accurately so that infantrymen would not drown ... . Well , he had to pick a boat crew now , and here were enough volunteers to fill fifty boats , all yelling to go . Pulling a crumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt pocket , MacDougall smiled for the first time since Quigley had come down from the cabin . They could not all go ; some of these boys were going to be very unhappy . Flattening his paper against the mess hall bulkhead , MacDougall began to put down the names of Brooks 's boat crew . A somber , dripping curtain hung over and all about the Belinda . Except for misty shapes of sister transports , dimly seen in squally night , she was isolated from all else about her ? intense feeling on her bridge of busyness and suspense reaching far beyond limits of visibility . Somewhere beyond that dank veil was Kwajalein , principal and most strongly defended island of the atoll from which it took its name . It was a cucumber-shaped citadel , seven miles around the rim , forming the atoll 's southeastern corner . Japanese headquarters for the Marshall Islands , bristling with guns , many of the strongest defenses underground and out of sight to curious cameras of American reconnaissance planes and submarines , Kwajalein Island presented fearful questions to the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated had been carefully evaluated , yet only intimate , perhaps costly battle experience would reveal what these Jap-  | anese had actually done against attack . This assault operation would be the first American attempt to dislodge Japanese from territory they had occupied previous to their sneak attack upon Pearl Harbor . Not lacking time to fortify Kwajalein , the Japanese were surely well dug in , yet it was doubtful that they had anticipated the extent or the fury of the mechanized hurricane soon to sweep over the reef . Notwithstanding its coral and coco palm flatness , Kwajalein Atoll is a tremendous area : great lagoon like a vast inland sea reaching far out of sight , a sea with choppy waves built up by the wind within its borders ; circling this sea a necklace of reef-connected islands , varying in size from seven miles down to tent-sized high spots on the encircling reef . Except for two deep-water entrances , the reef binds islands and sand bars together , forming an irregular-shaped enclosure , twenty-five miles wide and eighty miles long . Twelve of the twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be captured by the Army , carried in the attack force of which the Belinda was a unit . Another attack force would land Marine combat teams on Roi and Namur Islands at the northern tip of the atoll . So extensive was the vast lagoon that the two attack forces would not only be out of sight to each other , but beyond the range of tactical voice radio . What happened on Roi might as well be a thousand miles away as far as the Belinda was concerned . Minor landings were scheduled for the Southern Attack Force on D Day , 31 January 1944 . These included capture of small islands bordering Gea Pass , a narrow channel west of the main island and Enubuj , site of Kwajalein 's main radio station . Enubuj was situated five thousand yards westward around the reef from the southern tip of Kwajalein Island , where the main landings were to be made the following day . Planners had studied long over such inaccurate charts as were available , over photographs snapped from air and from periscope . These men knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island 's southwestern tip . They had to balance long stretch of reef and chances of being flanked against struggle for a landing at one end of the cucumber : most obvious landing place and therefore most strongly defended by the Japanese . They decided to make the main landing at Kwajalein Island 's southwestern tip . To assist this , two days of bombardment were to be implemented by the landing of sixty field artillery cannon on Enubuj , set up where they could be brought to bear upon the landing beaches of Kwajalein and upon enemy positions further inland . While of lighter caliber than naval rifles , these guns , once landed , could deliver more  | accurate fire than the moving gun platforms of ships or planes . As landing infantrymen advanced , field artillery on Enuhuj would handle barrage and call fire in congested areas , lessening the danger of killing Americans with so-called friendly fire . After the landing bombardment , thunder of Naval barrage would move ahead at a safe distance , or remain on Army call . Detail on detail , beyond remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; kept in locked safes , promulgated with careful secrecy down chains of command . Minute-tominute operation of planes , ships of every kind , landing craft , beach parties , approved weeks in advance by admirals . So also with the Army , proposed advance day by day , hour by hour , reaching down the chain to each combat platoon of forty men . Study operation plans ; search out details to be demanded of your brain and your flesh . Gather about relief maps of painted plaster , before blown-up battle plans displayed on hatches of transports for study by sergeants , corporals , privates . Suck in your guts and breath slowly . You 're on the best side of this thing , boys . Better to wait here , uneasy , nervous , than to be waiting on Kwajalein behind reinforced concrete , behind walls of felled coconut logs , in foxholes , spiderholes , in cellars , in cisterns . Better not to be on the taking end of this thing . Transport groups arrived off Kwajalein long before dawn on D Day . Gropings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polar projections showed both islands and ships , by day and by night alike in the same monotone of pale green . But now , watchers on weather decks saw great red fires leaping upward into the night and strange red tracks against black of night traced by fourteen-inch shells speeding from battleship gun barrels towards Japanese defenses , fuel tanks , ammunition dumps . Drone of carrier dive bombers circling and diving down in turn were blanked out intermittently by explosions of dropped bombs ; sounds preceded by quick flashes and occasionally by pyramids of new flame from ignited oil and gasoline , now and then from great pyrotechnic displays produced by lucky hits on Japanese ammunition dumps . A continuous succession of rain squalls swept over the fleet , soaking all hands exposed on weather decks and lending an atmosphere of mystery and unreality to the night action . Nothing was seen except shell tracers , explosions and fires on shore . Every ship was completely blacked out so that not even the slightest glow of compass light was exposed . Yet each group of ships deployed according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by electronic eyes . From his bridge , Gedney wiped squall water from his  | eves and gazed into murk ahead in which he could dimly see partial outlines of his transport group flagship , five hundred yards ahead . Here and there in obscurity he could find a spot even blacker than the night , indicating another ship . He could only sense the vast bulk of fleet units all about , as if his eyes , peering into dripping night , could visualize what his radarmen reported . This substitution of feeling for sight was the product of careful orientation and years upon the bridges of many ships . Gedney 's active thinking was directed to debarkation of troops aboard . Sherwood and his boat group were standing by to transfer a portion of the Belinda 's Army landing team to an assigned LST , one of a group which lay close in to unseen Enubuj Island . Gedney visualized the organized scramble down nets , the transfer across tossing black waters and final emergence from the LST 's ramp in armored alligators , clattering towards the radio masts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landings next morning on Kwajalein Island itself . With daylight , first glimpses of Kwajalein Atoll gave the same general impression as had Makin . only on a much larger scale : flat islands crowned with coco palms ; wind-driven white water breaking along the reef line . There was a lack of freshness here : carrier planes dived out of an overcast , squally sky upon coco palms , tattered , uprooted here , cut off at the stump there by two days of constant bombardment carried on by groups of old battleships , heavy cruisers and efficient new destroyers before this arrival of the attack force . Smoke from blazing oil dumps drifted for miles . Against this dismal backdrop , battleships and their lesser kin paraded slowly off assigned target islands , belching smoke and flame . Dive bombers streaked out of the sky to the very , fringes of tattered palms , dropped lethal burdens , made zooming , twisting escapes from fingered spurts of Japanese anti-aircraft fire which rose to meet them . All sounds and sights seemed blended together by the steady , never-ceasing drone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in precise formation high aloft , like eagles waiting for the strike . Transports and LSTs carrying troops bound for the capture of Fnubuj , Ninni and Gea islands were launching boats from davits , amtracks from ramps . Transport divisions committed to tomorrow 's main landing stood in and out , maintaining fleet speed and zigzagging to lessen danger from Japanese torpedoes . Minesweepers in staggered line abreast cruised carefully along the reef preparing the shallows for invasion . Mistress of every ship in sight was the old battleship Pennsylvania , here as at Makin the admiral 's flagship . Her broad signal  | yards blossomed with streams of bunting which were promptly copied by other ships . As if in example , her guns thundered loud ; quick flashes of fire and billowing smoke from her great rifles leaving no doubt as to her authority . Captain Gedney conned the Belinda , next in column to the squadron flagship Woodbridge . Instead of five transports in the squadron there were three columns of five , and their squadron was now but one of many . More dots showed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approach to Makin three months earlier : dots representing more islands and more ships . There was a businesslike attitude on Godney 's bridge this morning ? no undisciplined shouting heard about decks . Yet a troubled undercurrent flowed beneath this apparent calm . Scuttlebutt , that true or fancied rumor which is as much a part of every ship as her frames and bulkheads , spread like a grass fire from deck to deck , from compartment to compartment . Among twenty-six hundred souls aboard the Belinda was a generous sprinkling of calamity callers , consciously or unconsciously serving as ship 's jesters . Death and disaster to all aboard was predicted , each myth gathering more barnacles of lurid detail as it penetrated into remote compartments of the ship . Down in the boiler room , Blackwell , fireman first class , could see nothing going on beyond the limits of his ovenlike working space ; he could only feel and hear great explosions rapping sharply against the bulwarks where he stood , twenty feet below water level . There was tension , expectancy down below quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danger felt all around , pressing in like sea water outside that quarter inch of shell plating . A fellow could believe anything down here ; at best he would wonder and worry as Blackwell did now , listening to Zereko , the watertender , who had just come in from the engine room with the latest dope : " Five transports torpedoed ? just like that , before dawn . Grandy saw the explosions . . . . Big Jap fleet waiting in the lagoon . " Blackwell bit his lip . " We got battleships , " he said uncertainly . " Yeah , but that ai n't all . Seven hundred of them Nip bombers coming this way from Truk . We 'll all be swimming by afternoon ? if we do n't cook in steam and burning oil first . " In the two-squad boat team waiting outside the head at compartment zo6 a corporal from New Jersey told a private from Montana : " They 'll sink this ship , that 's what Dalton heard the major say .  | That suction carries you down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slimy and the sharks are waiting . " " Naw , that ai n't it . ' We 'll float , maybe . . . " voice of Private Albright , face twisted so you could n't tell whether he was kidding , whether he had really heard the dope  --  whether he was scared himself as he said , " The beaches are all mined , Toby . Them Japs will wait ' til we hit the beach and then ? pouff ? arms and legs and heads flying through the air . We ai n't got a prayer , Toby . We ai n't got a prayer . " The very exaggeration of these innermost anxieties relieved rather than added to unspoken fears . Idle waiting for the signal to go was the worst of it . Seamen busy on the weather deck and soldiers making last minute preparations before climbing down net watched the bombardment with outward casualness of sidewalk superintendents viewing an excavation . What gnawing fears each man suppressed were a secret of his own heart , hidden from others , possibly from his own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second division , the boat repair crew and volunteer helpers fitted out an LCVP which was slung outboard alongside the starboard rail at number five hatch . This was the craft selected for the reconnaissance trip to the reef . There were no blueprints , specifications or mimeographed operation plans for this job . MacDougall sat on the ship 's rail alongside the boat with his game leg resting on the gunwhale while he coordinated the activity . There was no reminder that this was a pressing military matter , no forecastings of doom ; rather a pleasant air of informality . " Good thing the Old Man 's too busy on the bridge to come down here , " MacDougall said to Tony Brooks , who stood beside him . " Gedney considers leaning on the rail very unseamanlike ; I 'm sure he 's positive that only a soldier , and a dumb soldier at that , would sit on the rail like this . " Brooks laughed , but the worry lines never left his face . " How do you think 1 feel about this little expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Then some other guy would be trying to figure out where to take this boat and what to do when he got there . " " You 'll be all right , Tony . Just take one thing at a time as you go Hong . " " That 's all right for you to say , Mr. MacDougall . I 'm going to foul this whole deal up , that 's for sure . " MacDougall looked at Brooks 's clear blue eyes and grinned . " You 've got what it takes , Tony . Do n't sell yourself short . "  | MacDougall swung around to have another look at the boat . Men swarmed over it from ramp to stern . Protective bulwarks of light armor plate surrounded the cockpit , which was lined with sandbags . More sandbags were carefully stacked about the engine box . The anchor line was new and an inflated rubber raft with a long , light painter attached was stowed beside it . Gunner 's mates fussed with the two thirtycaliber machine guns mounted aft . " It 's plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Brooks with a nervous laugh . " Ca n't be too sure about that , " said MacDougall . " Shadow Rockwell is likely to show up any minute now with turkey sandwiches and a thermos jug of coffee . " " That 's good . No use dying on an empty stomach . " Tony Brooks flinched as another great broadside exploded in his ear . He had just landed O'Bannion aboard the flagship and was now on his way to the reef . Chesney , the flag boat commander , had been no help at all . Brooks expected definite instructions , desired them as earnestly as MacDougall would have avoided them , but Chesney seemed bewildered , and for once had little to say . None of the three other boats had any navigational equipment or plotting sheets . Chesnev had a small scale chart of the island , nothing more . MacDougall had told Brooks , " These charts we have of Kwajalein are n't worth a nickel for close work like this . There never was enough trade here to warrant careful surveys ? until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this chart business ; you can bet they have good ones ! ... " It 's a cinch we do n't have either the charts or the island , Brooks thought as he hunted earnestly for a recognizable landmark ? otherwise there 'd be no reason for this questionable expedition . Well , here they were and it was going to be every boat for itself , by gosh or by guess . Brooks was beginning to feel that it would n't matter much now whether or not the Pennsy and her friends shot away the trees . Two battleships and five destroyers concentrated their fire on the Southwestern tip of Kwajalein , where the main landing would be attempted the following morning . The reef was broad and solid here , shallowing gradually as it neared shore . A long , rolling ground swell lifted Broolcs 's reconnaissance boat and shoved it along , half willing , half reluctant , towards Japanese coastal guns : bow suspended in space while the stern transom buried deep in the swirling trough , then the stern lifted sluggishly ? for weight of armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up it went while the bow dropped from under until the boat 's occupants found themselves looking uncomfortably over the ramp at Japanese defenses with the feeling that they were being catapulted onto the enemy beach . Brooks veered the boat sharply to port , heading for the reef where it linked Kwajalein and Enubuj Islands . Rain still pelted down from a gloomy and ominous-looking sky , product of squall cloud and bombardment smoke . Reflecting this grim mood , deep water off the reef had exchanged its usual brilliant blue for a dull gray both sullen and disturbed . The boat ran over the reef line . Restlessness of the sea was now compressed in shallowness , water hissing in a heaving mass of pale browns and dirty whites . No heavenly emerald of tropic reef here , but wild sobbing of waters as if shuddering at thunder and concussion of bombardment . Battleship projectiles , ejected from gun barrels with tremendous explosive shock , screamed close overhead as if trying to suck Brooks and his crew from their craft to fling them in pulp upon the battered stonework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a strange feeling , Brooks thought . I 've never felt so temporary in a boat in all my life . Reef must be shoaling . " Watch out for the bottom , fellows , " Brooks shouted . " We do n't want to get hung up here . " His ears rang with the violent detonations and there was a constant buzzing in his ears , so that he was not sure whether he had been heard . Then to his relief he saw Moran and Rinaldo lean out quickly to port and starboard where they could keep a better watch for coral . The tide was high . Had the day been sunny they might nevertheless have seen bottom ; but here in this dripping , clouded little world , sea was opaque and bottom lost to view as completely as the ship they had so recently left . Brooks forced his mind away from the comparative comforts and security of the Belinda and fixed his eyes upon the shore . The boat was nearly across the reef . Deep water inside the lagoon was clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the great atoll towards islands out of sight beyond the northern horizon . He watched the left tangent of Kwajalein , the battered trees . Yes , some trees were still left standing , though most of their tops were tattered like torn sheets left out in a gale . Then , as the boat moved along , other trees emerged froth the background : fresher , undisturbed . The craft came in line with Kwajalein inner shore and it was time to turn . Brooks placed his hand on Alvick 's shoulder , leaned down and shouted in his ear , " Head her for the  | beach . " Alvick nodded and spun the wheel . The boat came around , rolling sluggishly now : wind on her starboard beam . Red Beach lay dead ahead some fifteen hundred yards away  --  seeming even closer across open water . Brooks looked over the ramp at the muzzle of an ugly costal gun barrel pointing directly at him from a heavy masonry revetment . He need do nothing now save keep the boat on present course , and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth . Brooks shivered , looked at his strap watch . He could not hear its ticking above the bombardment but the sweep second hand moved steadily around with each accumulating second , utterly indifferent to what fate succeeding minutes might bring to Boat Twenty-Three , U.S.S. Belinda . Brooks looked at the beach again . The top of a tall coconut tree , cut from its trunk , rose , then fell against backdrop of smoke-laden cloud and dropped upon the shell-pocked sand . Pappv . V'loran raised his head suddenly and shouted something . His gravel-voiced bellow was lost in a broadside , but his lips and expression seemed to indicate bottom . Brooks leaned over the side , looking intently downward . At first he saw nothing but surging water , then a coral head and movement under the water ? something obscure , possibly fish or seaweed . The boat plowed onward . Two minutes had passed and they were within eight hundred yards of shore . What was that ? . . . Bottom ? Yes , bottom ? round little nubbins of coral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinnacles of sharp-toothed coral . Brooks raised his head to order out sounding gear , then saw that they were already at it . Moran , Rinaldo and McClintock had the gear ready . Hatcher , experienced in surf work , took over the controls from Chief Alvick and nudged the boat gently shoreward . The heaviest part of the extensive rain squall was now passing over . Wind-driven pellets , surprisingly cold , beat down upon them , soaking their clothes and everything in the boat . While Brooks and Scott struggled with sextant and stadimeter , the others began to take soundings : ten feet shoaling irregularly to seven feet , then to six . They tossed the sounding lines back into the boat and took up the marked bamboo poles , sounding solemnly and mechanically , holding up dripping poles and indicating depths with their hands so that Brooks might see . Brooks nodded , marking down soundings as best he could , until the plotting sheet became one soggy mass of indecipherable pulp . He looked at Scott for some indication as to what they should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments and plotting . Scott had taken  | off his helmet , which interfered with the eyepiece of his sextant . Water streamed from his close-cropped hair and ran down both cheeks to the corners of his mouth . He dabbed at fogged sextant lenses with a soggy handkerchief , aimed the instrument horizontally at the coconut trees , twirled the burled thumbscrew back and forth as he tried to bring the reflected image of one tangent of the beach into superimposition upon the other at which he looked directly . Scott took the instrument from his eye , noted water flooding the mirrors again , glanced at micrometer readings on the tangent screw and shook his head . More water cascaded down his face . He wiped it with one motion of a sopping shirt sleeve , then , resting the instrument on his knee , he looked up at Brooks , shaking his head again . All pretense of scientific accuracy ended here , Brooks realized . From now on it was just a matter of muscle and nerve outlasting the difficulties . He put the waterlogged chart back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , for it could not possibly get any wetter ? then tried to concentrate on remembering the soundings . Hatcher poked Brooks and pointed off to starboard . Men in the next boat , now some three hundred yards distant , had launched their rubber raft and were towing it alongside . Brooks shook his head . " Not yet , " he cried . " Too deep yet . Wait a bit . " His eyes darted from one pole to the other . It was not the depth that mattered the most but whether or not the reef floor shallowed gradually , free from potholes or coral heads which might spell the difference between success or disaster during tomorrow 's landing . Suddenly Rinaldo 's pole sank , so that the shipfitter lost his balance and nearly fell overboard . Deep pothole . Brooks looked quickly at tangents of coral shore and at the angular height of trees , endeavoring to mark the spot . Remembering MacDougall 's instructions , he reached for the stadimeter , wiped its lenses with a corner of his shirttail and put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the top of a tall palm tree sat at the water 's edge . The instrunient was set for a height of sixty-five feet , the estimated distance from water to treetop . The distance scale showed six hundred and ten yards . Brooks reached into his breast pocket for his notebook , but the pages were saturated with rain water and spray so that the pencil made no legible mark . He shoved the notebook back into his pocket and concentrated once more upon the soundings . The mean floor was now only four feet below the surface and seemed to be consistent . Brooks measured the tall tree again ; the stadimeter now read three hundred and seventy yards . He looked carefully at shore .
