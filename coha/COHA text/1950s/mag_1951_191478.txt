Any old hand could have told Mike DiSalle that a newcomer to Washington should never turn his back until his possessions are nailed down . Mike turned away for only one day last week , to make a speech in his home town of Toledo . <P> <P> When he got back , somebody had made off with a big chunk of his powers as boss of the Office of Price Stabilization . <P> As originally set up , DiSalle 's OPS was supposed to lay down price controls and presumably enforce them . But ever since DiSalle 's big price freeze , Attorney General Howard McGrath had been licking his chops over all those potential lawsuits . Suddenly , last week , the Administration trotted out a provision in the Defense Production Act which everybody seemed to have overlooked and gave the enforcement job to McGrath 's Department of Justice . DiSalle 's men could look for black marketeers and other violators , but when they found them they would have to turn them over to Justice ( which still has on its calendar 2,000 unfinished OPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Labor also got its feelings hurt last week in the grinding of mobilization gears . For weeks , big labor leaders had been pressing the President and Defense Mobilizer Charles E. Wilson to place a big labor man up there among all the big businessmen in the mobilization high command . They got no satisfaction . Then they discovered that Wilson was fixing to take control of mobilization manpower away from labor 's friend , Secretary of Labor Maurice Tobin . <P> Again the labor leaders protested . Again they got no satisfaction-Mobilizer Wilson made Dr. Arthur S. Flemming , president of Ohio Wesleyan University , his new assistant , and gave him authority over all mobilization manpower problems . The job given to Flemming , who has served in several Government posts , including the Civil Service Commission , was one Secretary Tobin had proposed with himself in mind . <P> Salve . To soothe labor 's slow burn , the mobilization high command quickly made a salving gesture . Economic Stabilizer Eric Johnston appointed George M. Harrison , president of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage issues . It was a salve-but not enough to quiet union leaders ' grumbles . <P> With wages frozen , prices rising and their demands for a voice in the mobilization high command unheeded , labor was in a disgruntled , resentful mood . Its discontent was not eased by the Wage Stabilization Board , whose nine members were still unable to agree on a formula for letting wages catch up with prices-and whose Board Chairman Cyrus Ching let it be known that as soon as the board does agree , he is going to quit and return to the more relaxing job of U.S. mediation chief . Probable successor : W. Willard Wirtz , Northwestern University labor law professor and acting executive director of the wage board . <P> Grumbled President Emil Rieve of the C.I.O. Textile Workers : " As far as the American people are concerned there is no stabilization program-except wage stabilization . Wages have been selected for control while other areas of the economy have sufficient freedom to go their merry way . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
