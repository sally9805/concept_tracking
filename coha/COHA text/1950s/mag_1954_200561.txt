MANNERS &; MORALS <P> As board chairman of Poetry : a Magazine of Verse , Ellen Borden Stevenson , ex-wife of Adlai Stevenson , functions as deficit sponge and guardian angel to Chicago 's spindly poetic colony and to artists in general . So vigorous a patroness is Mrs. Stevenson that no cultural gathering in the city is considered quite legitimate unless she is on hand . <P> Lots of Gumption . A year ago , when Poetry was turned out of its offices after 40 years , Ellen Stevenson fruitlessly searched Chicago for new quarters . Then one night as she lay awake a solution came to her : " Why do n't I have the gumption to rent my own house to myself ? So I did ! " Into the 70-year-old Borden mansion on Bellevue Place on little cat feet moved Poetry and also nine other worthy cultural refugees , including the English-Speaking Union , a little theatre group and a highbrow FM station . The old house where Ellen Stevenson grew up on Chicago 's Gold Coast had fallen on hard times , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a $40,000 remodeling job , Patroness Stevenson fixed it as a comfortable warren of culture , renamed it the 1020 Art Center . <P> The householders on Bellevue Place , tenants of sleek new apartments and keepers of genteel rooming houses , did n't mind the idea of a local poets ' corner until word got out that Mrs. Stevenson planned to convert the basement and garden of her house into a bohemian bistro . Chicago Gossip Columnist Irving ( " Kup " ) Kupcinet confided in the Sun-Times that Mrs. Stevenson planned " a European style cafe with a combination of theatre and nite-club performances . " The neighborhood exploded . In vain did Mrs. Stevenson and friends explain that the basement club would be private , the garden performances Shakespearean and very high-toned . " I could sue some people , including some newspapers , " cried Mrs. Stevenson , " but I sha n't . " <P> Lots of Yelling . Ellen Stevenson 's request for a food &; liquor license was turned down . She appealed , and when her lawyer , Sydney Wolfe , appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Bellevue Place neighbors , the executive director of the Greater North Michigan Avenue Association and the 42nd Ward 's alderman brought the hearings to a grumbling halt . Most truculent was Mrs. Martha Woodard , 75 , operator of four Bellevue Place boardinghouses . She shouted at a reporter , " I do n't think we need a bar there . The street 'll be crawling with the artistic temperament , with the boys with long hair and ribbons in the hair-or they should have ribbons in them . <P> " Never from these buildings have the police picked up anyone for dope or anything like that . " And Scottish-born Mrs. Woodard was n't impressed by Mrs. Stevenson 's social position : " I had a title when I came over here . I was Lady Rogers . But that 's all in the past now . I 'm very proud of my name , Mrs. Woodard , and very proud of my buildings . " <P> Sighed Ellen Stevenson : " I had to incorporate . Then I had to do all these other things . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I 'll talk . It 's completely routine . They always turn down the first application . There was a slight misunderstanding . "
