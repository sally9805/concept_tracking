In the scant hundred years since Pasteur developed the germ theory of disease , medical scientists have concentrated on helping the patient by attacking the germs , first with preventive vaccines , latterly with antibiotics that arrest or alter the course of full-blown disease . Last week , before a packed audience at the New York Academy of Medicine , Dr. Ren Jules Dubos , most imaginative of Pasteur 's scientific heirs , suggested a radically new approach : work not on the microbes but on the patient , so that the microbe-invaders will never have a chance to cause disease . <P> What started the Rockefeller Institute 's Dr. Dubos on the new tack was a common and persistent question : Why is it that a man can carry around for years a throatful of disease-causing bacteria without getting sick , and then suddenly come down with a roaring infection caused by one of the bacteria he has harbored ? <P> Clues to a Puzzle . The answer , Dubos concluded , lies in the physicochemical balance of the host . Somehow , his system becomes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not simply a question of a loss of the host 's immunity or an increase in microbial virulence . Dubos suggests that receptivity to infection in the first place may depend on bodily mechanisms entirely different from those which regulate other aspects of physical wellbeing , such as growth . So far , Dubos can only hint at what these mechanisms may be . One clue lies in acute starvation , as distinguished from long-range underfeeding . If Dubos takes well-fed mice , but omits their feedings for 30 hours ( not long enough to cause obvious physical distress ) , they become suddenly susceptible to artificial infections , which prove rapidly fatal . Some chemicals also have this effect-notably sodium citrate . ( By contrast chronically undernourished mice can maintain a normal level of resistance . ) <P> Acute starvation produces similar susceptibility in humans . So does diabetes . But most victims of diseases contracted under these malign spells recover their resistance to infection when their diet or metabolism is corrected . It may be that even among well-fed and generally healthy individuals , Dr. Dubos suggests , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly from day to day . If so , it may explain why a nurse or attendant in a leprosarium may be exposed to infection for years and then , mysteriously , fall victim to the disease . As Dubos puts it : " Contact and receptivity may be rarely coincidental . " <P> No More Treatment ? An immense amount of research must be done to find out what changes in the human body make it prone to infection-and , probably , more years of work to find out how to prevent or reverse these changes . But Dr. Dubos permitted himself a vision of the future : a world in which antibiotics and elaborate medical treatment will not be needed , because the power to resist infectious disease will be built into , and maintained in , man himself .
