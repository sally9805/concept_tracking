All over Michigan , dailies have been publishing pictures of unusually tall sunflowers . Last week the Saginaw News ran a " sunflower to end all sunflowers " : 75 feet high , being watered by a hook &; ladder fire truck ( see cut ) . " Firemen , " said the News caption , " were called out when observers thought frankly they were seeing a stalled flying saucer . " But the dozing Detroit A.P . bureau did n't read the fine print , missed the gag and sent out the picture over its wirephoto circuits as an authentic shot . Later , red-faced A.P . flashed its clients : " A kill is mandatory . Make certain the picture is not published . " As a substitute , it sent out a picture of a real sunflower-only 14 feet high .
