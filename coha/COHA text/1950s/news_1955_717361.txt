txt Ezra Taft Benson accepted the issue of declining farm prices and crop surpluses today as a key factor in the 1956 Presidential election . The Secretary of Agriculture told a television audience that the farm problem probably would be a major issue in the campaign and added : " That is perfectly all right . We are seeking help wherever we can get it , and if anyone has any suggestions , as to how we can better serve the farmers we are anxious to have it . " However , he said , the whole problem " is so important that it should never be manipulated to serve partisan purposes . " " Our farm program generally has been bipartisan in its development * We are going to do everything in our power to improve farm prices and improve living conditions on the farms , " he asserted . The Democratic farm-policy strategy committee will meet Monday in Chicago to prepare an attack on the Administration 's agricultural program . G. O. P. Concern Grows Mr. Benson was interviewed on the National Broadcasting Company 's filmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been growing among Republican strategists over the impact of farmer discontent on the party 's chances of retaining the White House and regaining control of Congress next year . His appearance coincided with what appeared to be the floating of a trial balloon by two Republican members of the House of Representatives to test public reaction to a possible change in the G. 0 . P. approach to the farm problem . Representatives H. Carl Andersen of Minnesota and Leslie C. Arends of Illinois put forward a " land rental plan " as a means of discouraging overproduction . This has been proposed before . Mr. Andersen , in a letter to Secretary Benson , proposed Government payments of at least 510 an acre to farmers who voluntarily took land out of production . He would make at least $300,000,000 available for the purpose . The Republican party , he told reporters , " can not expect to get ' enough support from farmers to carry the Midwest in the 1956 elections " unless something is done . Mr. Andersen is influential in farm policy matters as senior Republican member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agriculture Department . In a separate statement , Representative Arends said such a program was " worthy of consideration and may be one of the things considered after Congress reconvenes " in January . He is the Republican whip , or assistant minority leader , of the House . Secretary Benson , who has announced that he will hand Congress some " very specific " proposals to stern current declines in farm prices , did not directly mention the land subsidy plan in his television interview . The Administration 's recommendations , he said , willlinclude " changes to permit more flexibility in the cotton program , " more emphasis on soil conservation and " incentives to farmers to put more land into grass . " Incentives to plant grass could take the form of payments as suggested by Representatives Andersen and Arends , but Mr. Benson did not elaborate . The agriculture secretary , in , discussing possible solutions to the farm problem , also noted ( that the Administration had recommended greater freedom for farmers in feeding their crops 1 to their own livestock . " Wheat , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , we are under obligation to prosecute ) farmers who feed more than twenty-five acres on their own farm . We do n't think that is right . " Mr. Benson said there were " many favorable factors in the farm situation today , " despite , surpluses and falling prices . He cited the following as such factors : ( Farm real estate values are 2 per cent higher than they were last year . ( Warm machinery purchases have risen more than 20 per cent , indicating that the per capita income of farmers " actually " showed a small increase " while prices were falling . ( The ratio of debt to total farm assets is 11 per cent , corn . ( pared with . 19 per cent in 1940 , The Secretary again empha ? sized that surpluses had been accumulating long before the Eisenhower Administration had taken office but observed that " we have been selling them in very substantial quantities . " Appearing with the Secretary were Mrs. Benson and five of their six children . The children sang " Memories . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will be married soon , " Barbara Benson explained , " we are kind of reminiscing over our memories of the family together . "
