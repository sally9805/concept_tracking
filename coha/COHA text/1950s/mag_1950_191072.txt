Ivon Kitchens is a mild , silver-haired sparrow of a man with an enviable reputation : Britons ( who pride themselves in such matters ) consider him one of their best living landscape painters . Last week Kitchens was bidding for a reputation in an altogether different field : his new exhibition at London 's Leicester Galleries consisted almost entirely of reclining nudes . Moreover , the limp , heavy figures , painted in broad strokes of summery colors , were an instant hit . Kitchens ' switch to nudes , said the London Sunday Times , " has wrought a double change in his pictures , making them both richer in color and broader in construction . " <P> Despite what a gallery official called " the traditional prejudice against buying a nude to hang up in the home , " 18 of the 27 paintings on view had been sold last week for a total of 2,200 ( $6,160 ) . <P> Like his landscapes , the nudes are deceptively bland . For most of his 57 years , Kitchens has relied on sweet , misty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he has made sweeping strokes and smears of color stand for space , shape , weight and air . His method , he says , is like " playing " a tune-playing one color off against another . Sometimes it jars ; sometimes there is no harmony and I have to start afresh . But when it fits it 's wonderful . " <P> Mrs. Kitchens conscientiously criticizes her husband 's work-in-progress , calls it " our painting . " Between critical chores she keeps their crowded Sussex cottage-a small son and two grandmothers , three giant tabby-cats and a dog-in reasonable order . " I love a quiet , clean space to work in , " Kitchens says , " so when Mollie has cleared up a corner I go and work there ; when it gets cluttered up I move to another . " <P> His models are put up in a yellow trailer standing a few yards from the house . He paints them on couches " because they chatter less in that position . " The models serve merely as springboards for Kitchens ' cheerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are almost blank and their bodies have more paint than flesh about them . But the paint is beautifully arranged .
