txt Eight tiny silver statuettes were stolen Saturday from ) showcases in the Brooklyn Museum in one of the most daring museum thefts of recent years . Among the pieces stolen during visiting hours was a carving of a panther more than 2,000 years old . Other figurines that may have been pocketed or dropped in a handbag were created between 250 and 1,000 years ago . Though the value of the art works was admittedly high , responsible officials refused to , lgive any estimate . They simply eaned them " irreplaceable . " The stolen sculpture was among thirty pieces on loan from some of the nation 's leading mu-1 seums for an exhibition called " Sculpture in Silver From , Islands in Time . " While the crime was being committed dozens of persons must have walked within sight of the Print Room , in which the display was located . The . room is on the second floor of the museum at Eastern Parkway and Washington Avenue . The theft was discovered at 4:30 P. M. Saturday . But the owner museums were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brooklyn Museum . And the police were kept in the dark about the crime until yesterday at 2:30 P. M. The explanation for the delay offered by the museum director , Edgar C. Schenck , was this : " Rather than have all the museums involved read it in the papers , we felt it was better policy to think it through ourselves rather carefully . " The nettled police , after some careful thinking themselves , announced last night that today they would start a thorough interrogation of museum employes and begin a careful check on the city 's pawn shops , antique and curio stores and art galleries . Among the owners of the vanlished sculpture were the Boston Museum of Art , the Seattle Museum of Art , the Smithsonian Institution , the Walters Art Gal // lery of Baltimore , the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Kansas City , Mo. , and Princeton University . The theft was believed to be the first at the Brooklyn Museum since 1933. when paintings by Rubens , Cranach , Fra Angelica and Van Dyck were stolen . Those paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at first believed to have been a carefully planned job by art experts , However , it became apparent later that the thief was interested primarily in taking small pieces . The largest missing figurine was four and three-quarter inches tall and the smallest was one and one-half inches . The police said it was quite possible that the sculpture had been carried out in pockets . A guard was on duty at the main entrance to check on departing visitors throughout the museum hours of 10 A. M. to 5 P. M. The thirty pieces in the exhibition were in seven showcases in a room just off the balcony overlooking the main lobby of the museum . Two of the cases were in the wall . These were untouched . The remaining five were supported on legs about four and one-half feet high . Four of the cases were arranged in the shape of a square and the fifth stood in the center of the square . At 3:40 P. M. a museum guard checked the cases and found , them intact . He went to the washroom for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period another guard was to have covered the cases for him . The second guard , on the same floor . normally would be about 200 feet away . At 4:30 P. M. the loss was discovered by the first guard . He notified his superiors and the director was telephoned at his home . What happened during those fifty minutes , when at least one guard was said to have looked into the 20-by-40-foot room with two open doorways , was a matter of conjecture . One theory was this : The thief or thieves ? had worked with a small screwdriver . Each case was shaped like a small tent . Two screws held each of two slanted glass panels in place . Thus , by loosening two screws , a glass panel of the case could be raised enough to reach in and remove the tiny figures . Once the theft was committed , the panel could be lowered and screwed tight again . None of the cases was damaged and all the screws were back in place . The pieces had been taken from four of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the square was not disturbed . Conceivably , while one thief was unscrewing and raising the glass panels , an accomplice could have been watching Vie two doorways . The police did not discount the possibility that a woman with a handbag might have figured in the theft . Detectives removed the glass panels from the five cases and took them to the police laboratory , where they were dusted for fingerprints . The stolen pieces , all of which were insured , were : 4E0x in the Form of a Ram , T'ang Dynasty , between seventh and tenth centuries , from the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art . qKwannon on Lotus , eighteenth century Japanese , from the Seattle Museum of Art . cMan Riding the Llama , Peruvian-Inca , circa 1200-1532 A.
