The Republic of Korea 's hard-boiled old President Syngman Rhee dislikes opposition , newspaper criticism and elections - especially elections when , as recently , they have run against his Liberal Party . Not only has he been plagued by all three but also by a more serious menace : growing Communist infiltration and espionage from North Korea . <P> In a typical slam-bang effort to solve all his problems , 83-year-old President Rhee devised an omnibus security law that opponents , including the bar association , said was so loosely drawn that it could be used to silence all political protest . In a desperate effort to block the bill , 80 Assemblymen of the opposition Democratic Party barricaded themselves in the Assembly chamber for six days . <P> On Christmas Eve lowering clouds hung over Seoul and gusts of bone-chilling rain lashed the streets , drenching the policemen who stood guard with slung carbines outside the Assembly . Inside , the sit-down strike continued . Opposition Assemblymen slept beside their desks . In a seat near the rostrum , tiny Park Soon Chun , the only woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped her glasses . <P> Trucks filled with police and plainclothesmen suddenly roared into the street , drew up at the Assembly entrance . Moving at the double , the police burst through the flimsy barricades and charged the Assemblymen . A tangle of fighting , cursing men rolled on the floor or tumbled over desks , chairs and other writhing bodies . Park Soon Chun went down from a blow to the jaw . One by one , bleeding and still struggling , the sit-down strikers were hauled from the chamber and down the corridors , past jeering , pro-government Assemblymen of the Liberal Party . Eight had to be sent to the hospital . <P> With the opposition out of the way , the pro-government group hurriedly called a plenary session and passed the security-law revisions bill by a unanimous vote of 128-0 . For good measure , they rammed through 22 other bills , ranging from the 1959 budget to a bill that decrees that all mayors of South Korean cities , towns and villages will in the future be appointed by the government , not elected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donga Ilbo to declare : " In Korea , democracy died today .
