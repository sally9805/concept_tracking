While auto dealers grumbled of troubles past and present ( see below ) , the talk among producers last week was of the future . What will the 1955 models look like , and how will they affect sales ? <P> Last week the Wall Street Journal tried to scoop the industry by coming out with a dope story , illustrated with sketches of the 1955 models of Chevrolet , Ford and Dodge . Those who have seen the new models thought that the Journal had picked up some old blueprints of the Chevrolet ; there have been at least two new designs since that model . Ford executives were frankly surprised at the sketch of the front end of the Ford : it looked like a Studebaker , bore little resemblance to their 1955 model . The most accurate sketch was of the Dodge , with a flat hood and rear deck , high fender lines , and a wrap-around windshield with the window post slanting back , instead of being perpendicular as in G.M. cars . But there was no doubt that next year will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a total of nine completely revamped models ( 1954 total : three ) . <P> To nobody 's surprise , almost every make will shift to the wrap-around windshield pioneered this year by General Motors ( TIME , Sept. 28 , 1953 ) . In the continuing horsepower race , the most powerful engines will be boosted to around 260 h.p. ( current top : Chrysler 's 235 h.p. ) , and the switch to V-8 engines should be completed in 1955 . The new Chevrolets and Pontiacs will probably be introduced in early fall , the Fords in November-all earlier than the 1954s . But Chrysler , which had little success with its early announcement last year , will probably not be ready until December . <P> The rundown : General Motors , which completely restyled its Buicks , Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs this year , will only face-lift those makes for 1955 . Cadillac 's engine will be jacked up from 230 h.p. to nearly 260 h.p . <P> The big model changes will be in Chevrolet and Pontiac , which will generally resemble the Olds , have wrap-around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have a new V-8 engine with about 150 h.p. , v. its present 125-h.p. , six-cylinder power plant . Pontiac will probably get a 150-h.p. , V-8 engine to replace its present 127-h.p straight-eight . <P> Chrysler has given Designer Virgil M. Exner , a former Raymond Loewy assistant , a free hand on its 1955s-so free , in fact , that even last week minor changes were still being made on the new models on the test track . Chrysler , which has run against the trend to long , low styling , has reversed itself . Dodge and Plymouth will both be longer and lower . Chrysler 's most powerful engine will be raised from 235 h.p. to 245 h.p. or better . <P> Ford will have a new body for Fords , the first complete change since 1949 . Lincoln 's body will be basically unchanged but three or four inches lower .
