txt Boston 's operating deficit has climbed to $25,000,000 . This is in addition to its bonded indebtedness of $127,000,000 . The operating deficit is due to an accumulation of annual overestimates of the amount of money to be collected by the city and to excessive abatements of real-estate taxes . These are two of the main elements that figure in establishing a tax rate . If estimates of revenue were closer to reality and if original valuations each year were not at least $100,000,000 more than can be substantiated when appealed , the tax rate would be higher . The desire for a tax rate as low as /Possible each year has led city administrations to bow to temptations of deficit financing . Last year , for example , the tax rate was set at $69.80 . When the year 's books were closed on Dec. 31 , 1954 , the city found that the difference between the amount spent and the amount collected from all sources was $3,510,809.59 . Added to Deficit Rather than make up this difference in 1955 , this amount was added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of $24,749 , - 931.09 . Before 1947 this practice was not resorted to . This operating deficit forces Boston late each year to borrow $15,000,000 " in anticipation of next year 's taxes . " It does not need to borrow the full $25 , - 000,000 because it receives some money from the late payment of taxes and from the various income departments . Interest on the $15,000,000 amounted to $108,332 this year . In addition , approximately $400,000 in interest charges is paid directly to taxpayers at 4 per cent on abated real-estate taxes . This combination of interest payments spotlights some of the penalties of an unsound tax base and an unrealistic tax rate , Unrealistic Valuations A lion 's share of the deficits is due to unrealistic real-estate valuations in Boston coupled with the fact that corrected valuations are not heeded by the assessors in following years . Mayor Hynes admits this shortcoming and says it is the " major job to be straightened out in the city . " To do it all in one year , however , would be financially prohibitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Legislature this year which would do it gradually over a period of years . His bill would make it mandatory for Boston to set aside approximately $6,000,000 a year to cover abatements rather than the $3,000,000 minimum now required . This would fall considerably short of the actual amount needed , but would be a " step in the right direction " and help avert large accumulated operating deficits . Pushed by Hynes This bill would do nothing to correct the initial fault  --  namely , the juggling of real-estate valuations  --  but it would make the annual budget more realistic . This is the restitution part of the bill . In exchange , Mayor Hynes wants the Legislature to allow him to stretch over a period of time the payment of abatements granted on taxes paid for the period from Dec. 31 , 1949 to date . Abatements granted prior to Dec. 31 , 1949. are already part of a funding account . If passed in this form , it would save Mayor Hynes approximately the 1955 tax rate .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
