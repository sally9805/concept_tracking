txt For the first time since the last war a major conference between Western Powers ended in open disagreement when the Brussels meeting on the French amendments to the European Defense Community pact collapsed with a frank acknowledgment of failure . Despite the intervention of the United As and the mediative efforts of Britain and especially M. Spaak , and despite some concessions on both sides , Premier Mencl ? s-France remained adamant on the substance of the changes he proposed , and France 's five partners in the Community remained g equally adamant in rejecting them . The French Premier argued that the changes favoring France were necessary to obtain ratification of the pact in the French Parliament ; the other conferees  --  Germany , Italy , the Netherlands , Belgium and Luxembourg -- insisted that the changes would defeat the main purposes of the Community by undermining Western defense and European unification , and that no pact would be better than a parcel of pretense . There can be no doubt that the Brussels failure represents , at least for the moment , a blow to Western prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravest consequences . It threatens to poison the budding partnership between France and Germany , on which depend both European unification and American policy in Europe . It tends to delay and could even prevent an adequate Western defense , which , as President Eisenhower has told Congress , can not be fully effective without German participation , provided by the Community pact . It might even unleash a chain reaction throughout the world which could seriously impair the organization of free world defense everywhere . But the Brussels failure can not and must not lead to failure of the whole European Defense Community project . In fact , the rejection of , the French amendments may , In the end , help to save rather than to scuttle the project by preventing its emasculation and making French ratification easier rather than more difficult . In any case the battle now shifts to the French National Assembly , which is scheduled to start debate on the project over the next week-end to reach a decision which M. MendesFrance admits can no longer be postponed and in which he is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what strategy the resourceful French Premier pursues . But if he advanced ' his proposed changes seriously it is evident that he miscalculated . These proposals were not only rejected by France 's partners and allies , whom he did not consult in advance , they were also rejected by France 's own outstanding advocates of the Community project , including M. Schuman , who signed the pact and speaks for the Popular Republicans , and two leading Socialists speaking for that Socialist faction whose votes are essential for ratification . All of them warned that , far from aiding ratification , the amendments would only insure its defeat , which seems to confirm that the proposed changes would have lost more votes for the pact than they might have gained . It will be noted , however , that M. Mend ? s-France did not propose his amendments as a matter of principle , but only as a matter of etpedi- ency for the announced purpose of satisfying opponents of the- pact and getting it ratified . He is personally committed to the treaty , both by his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declarations , including the statement of ' objectives in the Brussels communiqu ? . He can therefore , ' go before the Assembly . and argue that he did his bestito gain further advantages for France at Brussels , that the Brussels results are demonstrably the best attainable , and that it now is up to the National Assembly to redeem France'is ! good faith and ratify the pact , with or without further reservations . ' He . has assured Chancellor Adenauer that he has not lost all hope of success . But the outcome is likely to depend less on hope but rather on whether he puts the full authority and prestige of his Government Ilehind the project . If he insists on ratification by a vote of confidence , with the threat of forcing ' a dissolution of the Assembly and new elections in case of defeat , success is assured . If he fails to do so and loses , he will have to bear responsibility for all the consequences that may ensue .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
