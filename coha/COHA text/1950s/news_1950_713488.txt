txt Soldiers and settlers who were celebrating Christmas day in Fort Dearborn in 1804 felt a spine tingling shock amid the merriment when a sentry raised a warning cry ? that Indians were approaching . Those around the huge Christmas tree cut from a nearby grove sprang to their arms , and music , dancing , and revelry were forgotten as armed men rushed for their posts . Fortunately , according to Paul M. Angle , director of the Chicago Historical society , who recounts the tale , the savages who were approaching turned out to be friendly . Within a few minutes , holid4r , cheer prevailed again . Hunters Provide Food There was food aplenty . Soldiers of the garrison had hunted in the woods north of the Chicago river the fort stood on its south bank where the Michigan ay . bridge now is , and they 'd brought back a fat ! luck deer , rabbits , a raccoon or two , and some wild turkeys . A roasting pig and a toothsome Christmas pudding were added to provide a huge feast  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President , and to Henry Dearborn , his secretary of war , who had ordered the fort built the previous year and for whom it was named . The Indians shared in the distribution of gifts . There were strings of beads for the Indians ; pipet ; and tobacco for the soldiers ; moccasins , Indian dolls , and bows and arrows for the children , and bright ribbons from Montreal for the women . Settlers Dance Until Tired Dancing began again , and the savages watched the settlers and the military men until the dancers grew tired . Then the Indians took the floor with a wild , shrieking dance of their own that climaxed the festivities . Music was provided by fifes , drums , and fiddles . Capt . John Whistler , grandfather of the artist who painted Whistler 's " Mother , " was in command of the garrison then , and it was he who arranged for the feast , according to Angle 's account .
