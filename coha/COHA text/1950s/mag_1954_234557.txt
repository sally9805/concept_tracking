" I took my pill at eleven , " reported Novelist Aldous Huxley in The Doors of Perception . " I was in a world where everything shone with the Inner Light . . . The legs , for example , of that chair-how miraculous their tubularity ... I spent several minutes-or was it several centuries ? - not merely gazing at those bamboo legs but actually being them . . . " Amateur Mystic Huxley was experimenting with mescaline , a drug which some have thought might become a psychiatrist 's tool , like pentothal and Amytal . The purpose of these drugs is to banish a patient 's inhibitions and " bring him out of himself . " One of the most effective of these drugs-and most bizarre in its brain-stabbing effects-is lysergic acid diethylamide , better known to the trade as LSD 25 . <P> First developed in Switzerland in 1938 , LSD 25 has been much neglected until recently . Unlike mescaline , which induces a series of euphoric dreams and images , or pentothal , which merely leads the patient through mental and emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 enables the patient to re-experience his past without loss of consciousness , and calmly watch himself in the process . This is , roughly , like the ordinary dreamer who knows he is dreaming while he is dreaming . The patient injected with LSD 25 can later recall everything that took place in minute detail . <P> In the current London Journal of Mental Science , three British psychiatrists , R. A. Sandison , A. M. Spencer and J.D.A. <P> Whitelaw , discuss the results of treatment with LSD 25 on 36 psychiatric cases . Their conclusion : as an aid to psychotherapy , LSD 25 is the best of all such drugs so far tested . <P> Given a standard ( 25 micrograms ) dose of LSD 25 , the patient first shows the symptoms of an addict of hashi He starts giggling or crying , soon switches to silence punctuated by an occasional scream . He trembles , sweats , and shows every symptom of terrible anxiety . Then he goes into one of several " experiences " : Patients can often recall and re-experience their childhood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was reliving an incident that occurred when I was quite small , on holiday ... I was not in the least surprised to see my hand and arm become quite little , about the size of a child of seven or eight . . . " Others find themselves way back in time : " Part of me was detached . . . <P> When I looked at the doctor 's hand , the detached part of me saw it as it was , the other part expressed a feeling of horror . . . the hand was so old as to be ageless . . . There were sand and bright colors . . . Egyptian ornamentation and a sphinx . . . Still others experience identification with friends or relatives . Several patients thought themselves to be their own mothers , and two went through the experiences of their own birth .
