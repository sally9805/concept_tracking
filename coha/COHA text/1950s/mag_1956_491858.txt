The Case of the Modest Mayor Each era fashions its own image of the ideal , candidate and it is conceivable that Robert Ferdinand Wagner , now happily reigning as the 202d mayor of New York , will someday be classified by political anthropologists as a prototype , or swing man . His chances of winning this posthumous distinction arc really very good , as he is generally considered to be on his way up from City Hall into higher regions . Though only forty-five , he is no one-man youth movement , being too smart politically for such juvenile nonsense . He is the kind of young man who does n't push his elders around . Should he make the grade nationally in one way or another his political bones will probably bear a label which translates from the scientific Latin as The Somewhat Extroverted Introvert . Within his own Democratic Party Wagner faces strong competition for the honor , principally from Gov . Avcrcll Harriman and Adlai Stevenson . But both of these men , on the record to date , have overdone the pitch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and qualify as The Quite Extroverted Introvert . This attempted skipping , even if it succeeds , is biologically unsound , the way a man who manages to grow three perfectly good cars is unsound , and Wagner 's rivals have already shown evidences of the dire consequences of their pushfulness . Harriman 's ancestral genes gibber audibly when he is addressing a proletarian audience , often causing him to fumble for the right vernacular word . Stevenson suffers from an acute compulsion to write his own speeches , a fault which is hopelessly aristocratic and which may cause him to miss important plane and train connections , and disappoint voters by the thousands . . Wagner , by temperament and by home training , is incapable of talking down to anybody . He was raised in a political household and from the time he could comprehend simple ideas he had the benefit of expert instruction in the art of attracting votes . He was later to need this training , as he was born a Grade A introvert . Introverts in high government office today arc rarities , except , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of the United States , where an associate justice may well mumble his way into the history books without anyone being the wiser . The winds ul political fortune in the elective field tend to reward full atroversion . Its identifying marks arc the muscular handshake , the stentorian blast at enemies foreign and domestic , and the firm assurance of deliverance from any morass in which the country  --  or city or state or county or sewer district ? happens to be currently mired The full-blown introvert , unless he pecks unremittingly at his protective shell , cuts a sad figure on the hustings and is almost invariably thrashed at the polls , His greatest weakness as a candidate is his abysmal inability to impart a sense of impending motion to the electorate . That is a fatal flaw , though it was not always fatal . As recently as 1934 , Calvin Coolidge , the : ill-time ace of inhibited statesmen , campaigned in the way that came natural to him and was elected by a vote of nearly two to one . In 19,2a Herbert Hoover delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he , too , was victorious . But an era was dying , and when , four years later , Mr. Hoover again talked from behind his choker , he was defeated . He had run afoul of an authentic extrovert whose skill at suggesting that great things lay on the other side of the mountain set a campaigning technique which is still in popular Use . While the vote which wrought the 1932 revolution was being counted , Robert F. Wagner , Jr. , an instinctively quiet and polite lad , was diligently trying to extrovert himself on the Yale campus by playing lacrosse , a rugged game borrowed from the American Indian  --  who , in turn , may have borrowed it from the shillelagh-wielding Irish . The lacrosse was part of a continuing program which had been prescribed by the student 's father , a United States senator . Rugged sports , the senator felt , helped a boy to acquire confidence in himself , just as having to grow to manhood away from the shielding atmosphere of home helped him to acquire self-reliance . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobbie of first to Taft , a preparatory school in Connecticut , and then to Yale . At Taft the boy had come through gloriously , making quarterback on the third team and getting his nose fractured in the annual game with the Choate third team . Senator Wagner , who was re-elected in the 1932 sweep to the second of what was to be four consecutive terms , was on the cvc of being tapped for the New Deal pantheon as the legislative symbol of its social legislation . ( In this field he was treading familiar ground . Many of the New Deal 's laws were prefigured in social measures pushed through at Albany a generation earlier by legislators Wagner and Alfred E. Smith . ) Senator Wagner considered himself already successful , and with good reason . Forty-seven years before that , when he was eight , his own father had brought him to the United States from their native Nastatten , Germany . They had settled in Yorkville , a predominantly German neighborhood on the upper east side of Manhattan , and the father had got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The immigrant boy , who on arrival did n't know a word of English , learned the strange tongue in the public schools . Tired of poverty and eager to succeed , the boy , on graduating from high school  --  he was valedictorian  --  shopped around for opportunities . The political field looked best , and it struck him as strange that , although Yorkville was almost as German as Nastatten , the influential politicians , whom he could tell by the thick cigars they smoked and the steaks they ate , were members of the Irish minority . Shrewdly , he came up with the reason fur the imbalance : the German immigrants came to Yorkville skilled in the manual trades , and the Irish came equipped with the English language . The Germans got small jobs and kept them ; they read German-language newspapers and on Sunday listened to sermons delivered in German . The Irish got small political jobs and rose to bigger ones . It was a simple matter of being able to communicate with the outside world  --  that is , with Tammany Hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that if he was to compete with the Irish he would need something that few of the Irish had  --  a higher education . By holding down a variety of odd jobs to pay his way , he got a bachelor-of-science degree at City College and a bachelor-of-laws at the New York Law School . In ensuing years Ile won financial independence at his law practice and steadily ascended the Tammany ladder . Tragedy marred his career when his wife , an American-born girl of immigrant-Irish parentage , died when Bobbie Wagner , an only child , was nine . Wagner never remarried . Thereafter he lavished his spare time on his son , passing up social engagements that interfered with his new role . %Viten he did go somewhere he took Bobbie along  --  to political meetings and rallies , to Tammany Hall itself , to the theater , to Democratic national conventions , on vacation trips to Europe , to poker games at the home of Al Smith . Wagner and Smith were close friends . After Smith was elected governor the two Wagners were frequent Sunday-afternoon guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns with the governor 's OM-da%resnn.in riding his great Dane around the l Always , wherever the pair went , the elder Wagner found time to counsel the younger on the ways of human nature as it expressed itself in polities . " When the other kids in the neighborhood were running in and out of movies , " says an old friend of the family , " Bobbie was soaking politics in through his pores . " It was Senator Wagner 's fond hope that his son would go far in polities , but he worried about the boy 's recessive amiability . He need n't have . The extroversion program , though far from a complete success , did the boy a great deal of good . Fowne thing , it awakened in him a dormant stFain of gregariousness , a valuable trait for a future politician to have , and made it a dominant . It was to make him an enthusiastic joiner , ultimately propelling him into three veterans ' organizations , three bar associations , the National Conference of Christians and Jews , the Friendly Sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . host of politico-social fraternities such as the First Avenue Boys and the Grand Street Boys . The capstone to his pillar of New York City . Before he was through joining , young Wagner was a lodge brother to almost every adult male in the five boroughs whose wife would let him out for an occasional evening with the brethren . When Bobbie Wagner came home from New Haven in 1997 he had bachelor degrees in arts and laws and a paper certifying that he had sandwiched into his Yale career a year at the Harvard School of Business Administration . He had an unwonted sense of urgency too ; he was all of twenty-seven , and time was running out . Thar fall his political career got off to a flying start when he was elected to the State Assembly . In 1938 he ran for reelection  --  to a two-year term , the Assembly term having been doubled in the interim . That same year his father 's senatorial franchise was up for renewal . Young Wagner carried the Wagners ' Assembly District by 125 more votes than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 499,000 . It was plain then that either the younger Wagner had political sex appeal or a lot of Yorkville voters had gone out of their way to be nice to him . Subsequent events indicated that the first guess was right . By the time the elder Wagner died  --  in May , 1953 ? his pupil had made satisfactory progress . Elected in 1940 to a third term in the Assembly , he had resigned late in 19-H and joined the Army Air Forces , He was assigned to the 8th Air Force in England and his duties fluctuated between military-legal matters , on the one hand , and combat intelligence and target selection , on the other . After the invasion of Normandy he served with the 19th Tactical Air Command , which helped to provide air support to General Patton 's 3rd Army . Returning home in 1945 , a lieutenant colonel with six battle stars , a Bronze Star and a Croix dc Guerre , he had resumed his solid and unspectacular plugging in the political arena . Under Mayor William O'Dwyer he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chairman of the City Planning Commission , all appointive jobs . In 1949 , once more entering the elective field , he became borough president of Manhattan . At this point in his career Wagner was a prime political puzzle . He was utterly lacking in personal color , a commodity traditionally held to be a candidate 's best friend in drama-loving New York . Yet lie had rung up votes at the polls in merry profusion every time he ran , The voters seemed to like him , and their liking was too impressively expressed to be attributed primarily to his father 's prestige , though that was and still is helpful to him . He was written off as a genial lightweight by both the professional politicians and the lay handicappers . One of the latter , after yawning through a speech by the new borough president , was quoted as saving , " Mistakes the people will forgive , but they wo n't put up with boredom . That young man will go nowhere , " The most significant aspect of the puzzle Wagner posed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but ignored it . An exception was the late and capable Edward J. Flynn , the boss of the Bronx , Flynn 's efforts at analysis flopped , but he knew a phenomenon when he saw one ; and as the 1953 contest for mayor drew near he began urging Wagner upon Carmine Dc Sapio , the leader of Tammany Hall , as the Democrat most likely to win . De Sapio was in a dreadful spot . He had spent most of his life fighting for advancement in the Hall , and in 1949 had gained the topmost job . But such was the Hall 's low estate by 1959 that he was less a leader than a trustee in bankruptcy . In thc manner of a good trustee , he had been trying hard to make thy Hall politically solvent again . But the whole structure was rocked when Mayor O'Dwyer , whose administration had been shattered by scandals , resigned in 1950 and was appointed ambassador to Mexico by President Truman . De Sapio then compounded the O'Dwyer disaster by making two humiliatingly bad guesses . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he threw the Hall 's support behind Ferdinand Pecora , and Pecora fell before a Democratic insurgent , Vincent Impellitteri . That deprived the Hall of the small fistful of patronage it had been desperately clinging to . Further injury , to Dr Sapio 's pride more than to the Hall 's skimpy larder , which was empty anyway , was sustained in 1951 , when Rudolph Halley beat De Sapio 's candidate for the presidency of the City Council . That really hurt , as Halley was an amateur with no political background . He had burst upon the public consciousness as the local star of the Kefauver Committee 's traveling investigation into crime . Against this background of blunders De Sapio was able to work up a good head of steam for Wagner in t953 , and Wagner obligingly came through and saved him . In the primary he knocked out Mayor lmpellitteri , who was trying to work back into the Democratic fold . In the fall election , with all of New York 's seven newspapers treating his candidacy as something to be swept under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a plurality of 361,000 votes , and the impetuous Halley , of the Liberal Party , by 566,000 . With Tammany 's prestige partly restored by Wagner 's decisive victory , Dc Sapio in 19a1 was able to shepherd Averell Harriman into the governorship . But Harriman 's margin was paper-thin and Dc Sapio had had to go into hock with the Liberal Party to bring off the feat . The source of Mayor Wagner 's surprising vote-pulling ability , while now an accepted fact of political life , remains a mystery . Certainly his famous father 's name is a diminishing asset ; the bearer of an even more famous name , Franklin D. Roosevelt , Jr. , failed of election in t954 to the state attorney generalship while Harriman was winning at the top of the ticket . Wagner is not the kind of man who can be easily identified in a crowd . The 177 pounds packed on his **28;448;TOOLONG frame give him a round appearance . His legs and arms arc short and his fingers stubby ; and no matter what kind of suit he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggy . His head is massive and topped by thinning black hair , and he has a long upper lip which serves as an indicator of his moods . When he is in a good mood . as he is most of the time , the lip seems to be almost proportionate to the rest of his face ; when his mood clouds up , it droops straight down like a piece of steel sheeting . His platform appearances are tremendously unexciting affairs . While waiting to be called upon he radiates a boyish naivetE , and when his turn comes to utter a few words , he appears to be deeply grateful and a little surprised at the honor being conferred on him . Asa speaker he gives off no sparks whatever , his delivery being about as exciting as the reading of the minutes of the previous meeting . His sole outstanding platform virtue is brevity . Wagner strongly resents the tradi tional political harangue as a time-wasting nuisance which causes the faithful party workers to lose out on their sleep . He considers himself a pioneer in breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting the clock and his listeners ' health . The other side of this virtue is his awn unearthly patience as a listener . At City Hall his day is filled by appointments every half hour and his deputy mayor has to come in and pull the watch on him when the time is up . " If that were n't done , " a member of his staff remarked the other day , " he would be listening to his first visitor until closing time . " Wagner does his listening with only an ear and a half . The left car was impaired by concussion during World War II in England . On a heavily overcast day a bomber , which had aborted its mission after having been crippled by flak , jettisoned its bombs on East Anglia near the spot where Wagner happened to be , the navigator apparently being under the impression that the bomber was still over the North Sea . As the mayor , Wagner has an almost abnormal fear of making quick decisions . He is fond of quoting his father , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maxims my dad drummed into me was , When in doubt , do n't ? ' My staff gets annoyed when I say I will take something under advisement for a couple of days or that I want to sleep on it , but I get Dutch-stubborn about it . The mayor of a city the size of this one ca n't make good decisions off the cuff on the matters that keep pouring in on him . Every time he decides something , one side loses . It 's that kind of a city . These issues mean too much to people . They deserve serious consideration . " On taking office two years ago Wagner knew enough about city government at first hand to realize that in a hive like New York no mayor , working on his own , could possibly keep up to date on the manner in which the many departments and agencies were being operated . After appointing the best department heads he could find , he set up s personal cabinet . Its members were the deputy mayor , the corporation counsel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other assistants . To forestall burgeoning departmental scandals , each cabinet member was charged with keeping an cyc on a handful of departments and reporting at weekly cabinet meeting if any trouble was developing in his group . This gave the mayor a pretty good synoptic view of how the sprawling city government was working . The cabinet was also expected , through its advice , to enlarge the mayor 's knowledge of new problems that always crept up during the week , thus assisting him in deciding what ought to be done about them . The innovation has worked well and no substantial scandal has popped in the mayor 's face out of one of his departments . When the cabinet votes unanimously on a policy matter , Wagner accepts the verdict without hesitation . On a divided vote he may adopt the minority viewpoint and make it his own or he may side with the majority . Some of the issues arc turned over to cabinet committees for further exploration and a later report , as Wagner has found that some municipal troubles , like some personal troubles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet meeting ends , five or six issues , too pressing to be given the committee treatment , remain ; these arc the ones that Wagner takes home to " sleep on . " He needs no written memoranda , as he has perhaps the best memory in the political field since Jim Farley went into the soft-drink business . One of his associates describes Wagner 's mind as being of the pigeonhole variety  --  that is , one in which eaieuh. of many matters has its own compart-ment , from which it may be extracted at will . The answers to some of the take-home issues actually come to him when he is asleep . It is a common experience for him to be awakened by an answer around three or four o'clock in the morning . He makes a mental note of it and goes back to sleep . Answers to other problems break into his conscious mind when he is engaged in doing something that is totally unrelated to the problems themselves . This may happen when he is addressing a civic organization or dedicating a hospital or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansion , the official mayoral residence , with the Wagner family . On arriving at City Hall next morning , Wagner , using from memory the agenda numbers of the previous day 's cabinet meeting , will tick of his decisions on three or four of die issues , and on the following morning will take care of the others . Next to the presidency itself , the job of mayor of New York is commonly held to be the toughest administrative public office in the country , and even the good staff work of the present regime has n't abated its rigors enough to get it out of the nerveof the city 's official cars . There is no siren , no flag , no dictating machine , no police radio , no distinctive license plate , Above all , there is no motorcycle escort . The mayor abhors them , partly because they arc distracting and expensive , but primarily because they make him uncomfortable . The only time he will tolerate one is during an election campaign , when he has to make , say , eight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . He suffers great emotional discomfort during these speedy excursions , sitting stiffly upright , biting his lip and saying nothing . The greatest call on his self-control during his European junket of last year grew out of his hosts ' unvarying conviction that motorcycle escorts were an American invention and hence would gratify any visiting American . The wildest rides he got were in Israel , where the escorting motorcyclists forced approaching cars off the road by riding head-on at them at high speed . Wagner was aghast atethis technique . A fairly typical day in the mayor 's life begins around seven o'clock , at which time he awakens automatically . Feeling very fit and optimistic , he bounds out of bed and showers and shaves . A butler brings up a tray of orange juice and coffee , and the mayor , still in a bathrobe , sips them while reading all four of New York 's morning newspapers  --  he reads the three evening papers on the way home at night in his car . He is a rapid reader endowed with a photographic eye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manages to cover pretty thoroughly the main stories from abroad , the editorial pages and everything pertaining to politics and government from the city level to the Washington level . At some point in his marathon newspaper reading Wagner is paid a visit by his two sons , Duncan , nine years old , and Robert , Jr. , twelve  --  who was Robert , III , until his father , on becoming mayor , unhooked the " Jr . " from his own name and bestowed it on the boy . The buys recite something they learned the previous day at school  --  a poem or the like  --  and dash downstairs with a dog or two barking at their heels . Gracie Mansion under the Wagner regime is a highly informal place . Before the mayor descends* from his bedchamber five or six men have arrived and have been ushered into separate rooms , where a maid brings them coffee or full breakfast trays if they prefer . They are commissioners or various other high-ranking members of the city administration . Until Wagner gets downstairs the visitors exchange small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave enough to der ) ; the morning glare , and does it quite successfully in a light blue dressing gown . An infrirmal , bustling household is no novelty to Mrs. Wagner . She was one of ten children sired by Duncan Edwards , a strong-minded Scotch Presbyterian lawyer , of Greenwich , Connecticut . ( Mrs. Edwards is a Quaker and the children were raised as Presbyterians . ) Daughter Susan , who was educated at Smith College , met the future mayor of New York when one of her brothers , a Yale classmate of his , took her to New Haven for a weekend . Mrs. Wagner remains a Presbyterian , her husband is a Catholic , and the children are being raised as Catholics . Al about st:SO o'clock , Wagner comes downstairs and secs the youngsters off to school . Then he makes the rounds of the rooms where his governmental colleagues arc waiting . There are short discussions about matters coming up in their departments , and the activities of the day are programmed . The visitors depart , except for one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wagners. %Viten the breakfast session ends around ten o'clock , Wagner and the guest break-fasters ride down to City Hall in the mayor 's car , continuing their discussions cn route . The mayor 's bodyguard , is police plain-clothes man , sits in front beside a nonliveried chauffeur . Few people take the occupants of the car for anything more unusual than a group of businessmen or brokers headed for the financial district . The chauffeur is under instructions to obey cops and traffic lights rigidly , and if he gets a couple of notches above legal speed , Wagner , who keeps an eye on the speedometer , orders him to slow down . He can be very fussy about such minor matters , hay ing a firm belief that as mayor he is bound in conscience to set a good example  --  even though practically nobody knows the car is his . Wagner 's evenings are rarely his own . Dozens of invitations to dinners and other mass gatherings flood into City Hall for every evening of the week . Most of them are turned down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest some publicity for get-togethers of dubious or unclear sponsorship . The rest are classified according to their importance  --  civic , charitable , religious or political  --  and Wagner takes on the one that seems to call most for his presence . The others are parceled out to his assistants to attend as his deputies and utter a few noninflamrnatory words . " I used to own just one dress shirt , " one of the assistants remarked wryly a few weeks ago . " Now I own six . " On leaving City Hall at six o'clock , Wagner forgoes the pleasant prospect of a cocktail at the Yale Club  --  a stop he often made when in the less-demanding job of borough president  --  and goes straight home . He does this in order to enjoy some time with his family before leaving for his appointment on the hotel-banquet circuit , Wagner 's favorite season is summer , for then the dreary circuit slows down to a walk , owing to the vacation absences of the casehardened banqucters , and the mayor gets more free evenings . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small clan at Islip , Long Island , where he owns a house . If the nearby golf courses are n't crowded he gets in a morning round with his wife . ( Wagner used to shoot in the low eighties , but he has n't played much golf in recent years and his game has deteriorated . ) In the early afternoon all hands get aboard his twenty-nine-foot cabin cruiser and ride out into Great South Bay , where they drop anchor and swim in uncrowded seaters . After they have had enough of swimming , they put in at Fire Island for a picnic dinner on a secluded strip of beach , returning to Islip at sundown . Barring a political cataclysm of some kind , Wagner seems certain to continue his rise . He has already been mentioned as a possible Democratic nominee for Vice-President this year and , of course , that would suit him most . The odds against this taking place arc very long , though , and next fall is more likely to find him campaigning fur the United States Senate . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Lehman , decides not to run for re-election . Senator Lehman is pushing seventy-eight . If neither of these events comes to pass , Wagner will probably stand by and run for mayor again . The governorship , to which he could also have the nomination , does not tempt him much . On a recent trip to Albany he remarked , on leaving the gingerbready Executive Mansion , that the visit had convinced him that Gracie Mansion was the finest piece of real estate in the country . He could be right about this Gracie Mansion is a lovely Colonial frame structure which was erected in t 799 for Archibald Gracie , a wealthy ship owner , on a point overlooking the East River in the Eighties . Its grounds form a fenced-in en-dame within Carl Schurz Park , and the view from its piazza is superb . Major L'Enfant , the man who laid out the city of Washington , is reputed to have been the architect . Wagner has a private income , through inheritance and through a law practice at which he worked before becoming mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support his family in the manner which he holds to be reasonably proper . However , the mayor of New York has it good , as the saying goes . There is no rent to pay and the mayor 's salary is $40,000 a year . In addition , he gets an allowance of Se.5,000 to pay the mansion staff  --  a butler , a cook , two maidsand a laundress  --  and a flexible allowance for official entertaining and for the food bill for the family and its staff . There arc also certain intangible rewards about mayaring that make loftier political heights less attractive than they ordinarily would be . One is the people the mayOT meets . A newspaper publisher had him to lunch one day and put in a strong plea for the use of suction sweepers in street clean . ing , a simple adaptation of the homevacuum-cleaner idea . Wagner replied that the Department of Sanitation had experimented with suction sweepers and had found that they were useful only in removing dead leaves from gutters . " And New York is not what you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The publisher thereupon tossed in an idea for checking juvenile delinquency , the logic of which ran as follows : the root of juvenile misbehavior is an intense feeling of not belonging , of being of no importance ; therefore , why not invite the leaders of the city 's two zip-gun gangs to a day at City Hall , where they could take turns sluing at the mayor 's desk , " preside " over the City Council and otherwise gratify their craving for importance ? The mayor did n't answer that one . He was busy choking on a mouthful of the dessert .
