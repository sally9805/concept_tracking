Te 'd been practicing for days , all the boys and girls ? going to the assembly hall for it . They 'd play the song , and you 'd have to stand up . Then they 'd give you a dummy diploma and you 'd say ' Thank you ' to the teacher . We were told all the boys must look alike ? blue suit , red tie and white shirt . Every time I went home I reminded my mother and father I needed that suit . " Finally , the night before graduation I knew they were n't going to get it for me . So what did my mother do ? She took a pair of pants and ironed them . She bought a new pair of suspenders and gave me a black bow tie with a rubber band on it . She gave me a plaid shirt . When we lined up by classes in the yard , I felt like an outcast . As a matter of fact , I got in a fight with a boy who made fun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the teacher in charge of the yard put me in a corner , and she said I could n't go to the assembly because I was n't dressed right . I figured my mother would come and that they 'd hare to put me in the assembly . But my mother did n't come . It bothered me so much it put a picture in my brain . " I 'll never forget it . I 'll never forget how I looked to the other kids . And I 'll never forget how the teacher told me I could n't go to the assembly . I had to stay downstairs with the janitor because all the teachers were upstairs . " ( Tony tried to run away , but the janitor stopped him and bought him a bottle of soda . " Do n't be crazy , " the man told him . " That 's why I 'm a janitor today , because I used to be like you . That 's why I 'm cleaning buildings . " But Tony said he was " in no mood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to listen . All I knew was I wanted to be in that assembly . He said , ' They 'll probably call you and you 'll still get your diploma . ' I waited , but they did n't call me . The teacher gave it to me in the hall , when everything was all over . To me , the diploma was no good . I tore it up . " That night I did n't care for nothin ' . All I knew was I wanted to get even with somebody . I was afraid of my mother and father , but the school seemed like a perfect target . So I broke into the school . All I had to do was break a window . " I was so hurt , I killed everything . I took fish out of the bowl and banged them against the wall . I broke the piano . I took paint . Some classes had paint where they were painting bookshelves yellow . I painted all the blackboards yellow , ripped up my teacher 's records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't care if they caught me . And I felt better when I walked out of there . I felt like I 'd evened the score . " ( The school acted promptly . They notified the police juvenile squad , and Tony was picked up . He was taken to Youth House , a detention home for children . It was his first brush with the hue , and to him , the arrest had a big advantage. ) ow that they 'd put me in jail , I knew my mother would have to come and see me . Now people will pay attention , I said to myself . And she came , and she was crying . I told her , ' You should have bought me that suit , ' She said , What are you talking about a suit for ? We 've got to get you out of here . ' ? ( Tony had been trying to get his mother 's attention as long as he could remember . He was born of Italian parents in one of the slum blocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a petty gangster . After a stormy marriage of three years , the father packed up and left , flinging a flatiron at his wife in a parting gesture . Tony was a year old . His mother remarried and , when she was about to have another child , she put Tony in an orphanage for several years . Eventually she had him come home , but she remained embittered against her first husband ; and the young Tony , who had the looks and mannerisms of his father , irritated her whenever he misbehaved. ) hen I was nine or ten years old , I slept in a room where I could hear my mother talking with her lady friends in the kitchen . If I 'd done something I should n't in school , she 'd say . ' He 's just like his father . He ca n't get along . ' And her friends would say , ' Like father , like son . ' Everything I did reminded my mother of my father  --  the way I wore the belt on my first pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing downstairs , I unloosed the buckle just the way my dad did , although I 'd never seen him . My mother said , ' Look at Tony ! He leaves his belt open , He gives me the same trouble his father gave me ! ' " That made me curious about my father , and I began to ask people what he was like . From my aunt I learned a lot of things about him . She told me that once , when I 'd just been born , that he 'd called her and said he 'd bought a carriage for me but was embarrassed to wheel it home . Would she pick it up in front of a store and push it home ? She was so excited that he 'd done something good for a change that she rushed down to the front of the store , took the carriage he indicated and wheeled it to our house . " ( Later Tony 's aunt learned the truth . His father had stolen the carriage , and was afraid that if someone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught . When Tony had first gone off to school , he was shocked to learn that his stepfather was not his real father . ) I 4 ? hated that word ' stepfather . ' I almost hit a teacher once for saying it . Lots of times I used to pretend my stepfather was my real father . But whenever I got into trouble , whenever I Hew ' an airplane around the classroom or something , my mother would say , ' You ca n't do anything with Tony . He 's bad , just like his father . ' I used to be punished by being made to stay home while my sister and stepbrother went to the movies . ( As a matter of fact . Tony was being punished when his family would not get him that blue suit for graduation . And as a result , he spent three weeks in Youth House for wrecking the school . He received lots of often tion  --  front his mother and stepfather , as well asfrom the authorities . He begun tofeel as thought " somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good student . He went off to another school and teas put in a class for problem children , but soon found that his past was n't easy to shake off . As a result of his stay in ran th House , he had to carry a yellow card. ) ? his here card ruined me . Every forty-five minutes we went to a new classroom and met all kinds of teachers . Since I was new in the school , I had to show the card to every teacher I met . The first thing they 'd ask me was , ' Did you play hooky ? Is that why you got the card ? ' Sometimes I said , ' Yeah , ' and after a while I said , ' It 's none of your business . ' Since I had a yellow card , every time anything happened in class I 'd get the rap for it . The teacher was supposed to sign my card after every class , but I soon developed the trick of signing my own card . I 'd put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' after it . " Every week I had to show the card to the parole officer . He gave me the feeling he was n't taking no water from nobody . When he found out I was signing the cards , he gave me a kick and a couple of good smacks in the mouth . " That made me mad . So I went back to school and started shaking down the kids . It happened first during cracker call . The milk you got was free , but the crackers cost a penny apiece . The teacher would take the box from row to row , and if you wanted five crackers , you gave her a nickel . A lot of times I 'd wanted a cracker , but I did n't have any money . And . I used to hate my family for not giving me any , and I 'd hate the other kids that had the crackers . So finally I watched to see which one had the most change on him , and if I thought I could take him with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd rob a pen in the classroom , and sell it to another kid for a nickel or a dime . When cracker call came the next day , I wanted to be able to buy three or four crackers . That 's all I cared about. ? ( Tony lasted at that school only a few months . Front there he was sent to Public School 37 , another school for problem children , on 87th Street . It was known as the " crime school. - Now ii 's called the School of Opportunity . ) I C was n't in there more than an hour when the teacher called me in front of the room and told me to empty my pockets . I had three dollars in change . She took half the money and gave it to the Red Cross and kept the rest except for a nickel , which she gave back . She said that boys in that school were n't allowed to carry that much money around , and that if we had money like that , we must have stolen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that school was that they locked the doors . Once you got in , you could n't get out again until three o'clock . Then they 'd give you a cardboard ticket , and you had to give it to the man in the subway so you could get a free ride home . The teachers there liked to show discipline , and they used their hands a lot . You could n't fool around in that school . You 'd get smacked right in the mouth . " The next time I got in trouble and was sent to Youth House I was twelve . I robbed candy bars on the subway . You know those stands ? We used to wait until the train was just about to pull out . Then we 'd grab a whole box of candy and run on the train . A few months later I was sent to Youth House again for robbing a bike . Then again for playing hooky . " Finally , they took me out of the school on Eighty-seventh Street and sent me to the School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was getting older then and a little more particular about my appearance . I liked to wear a white shirt , but we were supposed to take it off during the time we worked on the machines . But me , figuring I looked so great in a white shirt , I did n't want to take it off . So one day the teacher figured : The only war Ill straighten this guy out is to teach him a lesson . He gave me the job of oiling all the machines and told me to leave my white shirt on . I got oil all over the sleeves and cuffs . I blew my top about that and broke a machine . They put me in Youth House again . " ( After his sixth visit to Youth House , plus a stay in a Catholic correctional institution , Warwick , Tony decided he 'd had enough of school . He decided to quit . The truant officer did n't bother him , and his f ly did n't protest eery rigorously . In his own words ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t like Tony , 11 ? 110 fence school at the age of fifteen . there et.ere tow ways to spend gangs and in candy stores . Tony did both . lie snort became the leader of to gang which started out with gone ! intentions . as a kind of ( milt . it urns v. - posed of people like him  --  the outcasts of the neighborhood  --  arid they planned to buy uniforms and play baseball . lint they ' weer quire got ( ( ( ( ( ! Id to playing games . There were more exciting things to do . ) " It happened this way One nigh ( we were walking along First Avenue . There were a couple of drunken Puerto Rican guys , and they got smart with us . We gave them a beating and we took the watches off them . The next day we were all talking about it . We got such a kick out of it that we went out and did it again " Then we broke up into groups . Sonic of us would go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on First Avenue . If a new guy wanted to join our crew , we 'd make him go to Third Avenue to prove he had enough heart to do what we were doing . Third Avenue was where all the cops were . He had to roll a Snick , or Puerto Rican , on Third Avenue and bring back a watch or a wallet to prove he 'd done it . Some of them never came back . Some got pinched on the spot . " We started out with ten guys in our gang . Soon we had thirty-five . You had to be a little above the average , a little crazy , to be one of us . You had to stab a guy or do something outstanding that no other kids in the neighborhood would do . We called our gang the Red Wings . You 've lead about it in the papers . Ii was all Italian  --  no Spanish , no Irish , no nothin ' . Just Italian . We decided to keep the people we did n't like in line .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Puerto Ricans were moving in , and the girls in the neighborhood told us they were being bothered  --  you know , whistled at and cursed in Spanish . The girls wanted a little excitement , too , I guess . They 'd tell us about some guy that was bothering them and we 'd go and give him a beating . If he was n't where he was supposed to be , we 'd give another one a beating  --  any Spick who happened to pass by . " Once we burnt a church . A lot of Spanish people had rented a store and made a church out of it . We burnt the front while the people were inside . One woman got burnt on the hands trying to get out . We did n't care . To us it was a big joke . We used to go looking for Puerto Ricans , mugging them , taking money off them , stabbing them , beating them up , going into the candy stores where they hung out and breaking up their jukeboxes . They finally got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They called themselves the Copians . They 'd fight us and we 'd fight them . It got to be a big thing , especially with the girls . They 'd say , ' Did you hear what the Red Wings did last night ? ' We liked that . " Some of the weaker fellows in the neighborhood stayed with us for protection . They 'd run our errands , bring beer and stuff for us . In return we 'd make sure they did n't get in any trouble . They were like apprentices . " After I 'd been out with the gang . my mother would sec me coming home , my me a five-dollar bill or perhaps a credit slip . With this , you could get all the ciga- , rettes you wanted for a month , plus what .. ever you wanted to drink . " At one time kids could buy counterfeit money in one of these stores . The bills were tens and twenties . They were selling a hundred dollars ' worth of counterfeit money for twenty-five dollars to the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coffee grounds and hair grease and stuff to make it look used . When kids in the neighborhood were doing dishonest things , their pockets were full . And they were n't going to school with the morfey . They were gon na hang around the candy store with the money burning a hole in their pockets . The jukebox was going all day long , cigarettes were being smoked , and there was drinking . And naturally the kids were looking to make another buck too . " No cops came into the candy stores . In fact . they were usually on the owner 's payroll . He gave them a five-dollar bill , maybe ten , each week to stay away . " Who owns these candy stores ? Generally guys who do n't live in the neighborhood . Half of them live in Long Island , the rest in better parts of town . In the morning , bright and early , they came down there and hung around all day long , just sucking the blood off them kids . Then they went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You never saw the owner 's kids hanging around the store . The owners made sure their kids were far away . " Some of the fathers in the neighborhood knew what was going on , but what could they do about it ? If a father raised a hand to one of those candy-store owners . he 'd have every window in his house broken . if he had a car , he 'd have four flats every day . If he hollered ' Cop ' and called up the ( Continued on Page NI ) ( Clnitirstrel Pena Pave 9v ) police and said , ' My son 's in the candy store , drinking . ' how long would the mail last in the neighborhood ? No time al all . That 's the law of the block , You do n't holler ' Cop ' " ( hi the cattily stores , Tony got his first rent Unite for money . It ; cos born of a desire to have prestige , to " be " I saw this older guy . He was flashing rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell ! If that guy can get away with it , why ca n't I ? ' He would slap twenty dollars on the candy-store counter and tell everybody , ' Take something . You want a drink ? You want a soda ? Give that kid a pack of cigarettes . ' I wondered why I could n't be a sport , why I could n't he like that . " ( Tony 's desire for big ; trolley led to his first armed holdup . ) " It was in the Bronx . You do n't do those things in the neighborhood where you live . The older guys would n't stand for it . They do n't want the cops coming around interfering in their business . So we went up to Bruckner Boulevard . It was a tavern . I went with two fellows . One was fourteen , one was eleven . An ex-eon that we met in a candy store told is where to get guns . We had to pay fifty dollars for one gun . If we 'd lost the gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ netted 5150 , so we made a hundred . It did n't mean anything for kids like us to use a gun . They took pot shots all over the neighborhood , shooting at windows , lampposts , even the Puerto Ricans . " ( Tony was big for his age , and during his early teens he looked and acted older . ? ! long with var ' .5 other gang members , he found it emsy get away with things older hoodlums did . Inspired by people he met in the back rooms of the candy stores , he went in not only for holdups but tire stealing , mugging of " Greenwich I ' Hinge queers , " breaking into apartments on tips from ex-convicts who could n't afford another pinch and seat a kid , and delivering alcohol illegally across state lines . In fact , lie bought hi.s first car  --  for flut thieving , " robbing apartment houses  --  when he was fifteen . ) " I bought the car from a fellow in the neighborhood . It was a 1937 Buick , seven-passenger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could put a lot of stuff in it . Later we bought other cars and never had a license or registration . And as long as we were in the neighborhood we were safe , The few times when we did get stopped we just gave the cop some money . Kids in our neighborhood were not afraid of the law because they knew the law would take a bribe . The only thing we were afraid of was new cops . We did n't know how they 'd be . But nine times out of ten the cops we met would take a bribe . " ( On several occasions , Tony had legitimate fobs , btr but they did n't park the excitement of the illegitimate ones . They never lasted very long. ) " 1 worked in a gas station owned by two Jewish fellows . They seemed to like me . I got the job one night when some of the gang were hanging around the station . The elevator operator for the garage part did n't show up . and the owner asked me if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He showed me how the elevator worked , and I ran it all night . I liked it . As a matter of fact , when it started getting morning , I swept the elevator out and shined up all the brass parts . Both owners were so pleased they gave me a job washing cars . But I did n't last long . The gang came looking for me , and once I tried to rob some tires out of the station because the father of one of the kids wanted to buy a set . But , I robbed the wrong-size tires . I brought them back , telling the Jewish fellows I 'd found the tires for them . They believed me . " Then I worked For an Italian fellow named Louie . He owned a restaurant . I was supposed to be a dishwasher , and on Saturdays wait on table . I did n't last long with him either . He had the habit of pulling on the cars . Whenever anything went wrong , he 'd just grab me there . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the cash register , and he told me , ' Whenever you get a tip , put it in there . I 'll hold it for you till the end of the week . ' But the end of the week came , and he did n't want to open the jar . A week later , he still did n't want to open it . So one night , we had an argument about it , and he told me he 'd open the jar when he was good and ready and to keep my mouth shut , Later , when he was in the back making pizza pies , I sneaked to the front , opened the jar and took all the money out . But he heard me and came running from the kitchen . He grabbed me by the ears and called me a crook , saying I 'd touched the cash register , which I had n't . " I took the jar and threw it at him and skirted running out of the restaurant . He came after me . As he got near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to try to slop him . The chair did slop him , and I never went back . As a matter of Fact , I did n't have any more jobs after that . I made a living on my own , stealing , mugging and flat thieving . And pretty soon I discovered a way to make some real money : ' ( The " real money " came from dupe , and it was probably inevitable that Tony terruld get into it sooner or biter . In the bark rooms of the candy 141 ore.s where Tony hung out there tram CCM siernt talk of the Mt off , and the men in the lousiness were always on the lookout for the kind of kid they could use . II ifla their expensive clothes , jetrelry and air of generosity , they prepared Truly for the role long before they were ready for him. ) " 1 wanted to get into it . I wanted to make money . I wanted to better myself . I did n't want to be a dog all my life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls hanging around would n't give you a flop if you did n't have a decent car or a different pair of shoes to put on every day . And my mind was on girls , cars , clothes and drinking . " ( One day- , when Tony had just successfully robbed ( lila . the " pushers " were ready for him . lie was not yet sixteen , but he bright , aggressive and looked older . ) " It was the first time f sold ' junk . ' This guy asked me if I 'd like to make a few . I knew exactly what he meant and I said , ' Yeah . ' " ' Between you and me ? ' he asked . " ' Between you and me . ' " ' All right , ' he said finally , ' you look like a kid I can trust . ' " That started it . I got fifty dollars a drop  --  that 's a delivery  --  for every piece . A piece is an ounce . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash . IF I delivered two pieces , I got 5100 . If I brought half a piece  --  that 's eight spoons. ' got thirty dollars . " The biggest part of the business was on the West Side , in the colored section . Some of it was in the theater district . But a good part of it was out of town  --  Detroit , Washington and Philadelphia . Washington was one of the biggest . Kids made deliveries there , but you ca n't be too young ; otherwise they 'll stop you on a plane or train . But if you looked older and had the gift of gab , the boss sent you out of town . " ( Tony made lots of deliveries , but never saw anybody higher up than the mare he was working for . Ile never knew where alt the stuff yam contiog from . ) " Mostly , you get it from one man , your boss . He 'll tell you , ' Go to such and such a building , pick it up under such and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may get five ounces this way . When it 's gone , the guy will tell you where to pick up another bundle . Sometimes it 's mixed , sometimes it is n't . There are drugstores in the neighborhood that will sell you stuff to mix it with  --  quinine , baby powder with sugar , or other stuff . There are drugstores that sell everything you need  --  bags to carry it in , scales to weigh it , everything to do with narcotics . Everybody makes a buck on the junky . A junky 's the guy that takes it , and by the time he gets it , its apt to be garbage , what with kids mixing it , and everything . " After a while I got real good at the job  --  fast , I mean . I could mix it , cut it , test it , sell it . l was in demand and got all kinds of offers . I connived . If I knew someone who was paying rise hundred dollars for the stuff , I 'd figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I went into partnership with another guy , an older guy , to make deliveries . He did n't trust me , and 1 did n't trust him , We had a good connection , and we had guys working for us . It was like a big dry-cleaning business . We had five curs and we handled junk in bigger and bigger quantities . " But there was one thing we never did . We never fooled around with narcotics ourselves . I 've never taken any . I 've never even tried one of them junked-up cigarettes . I 've carried it , delivered it , mixed it . sold it and even put it in people 's arms when they were too sick to do it themselves . But in the dope racket you 're considered very low if you use it . It 's kind of a law of the underworld . You 're not trusted if you use it . You 're considered a junky .

I gave him forty dollars a week just to let me use the house for this . Now I could dress up and flash money around . " I felt more or less like something . I did n't feel like I was just a broken-down kid in a scurvy neighborhood . 1 felt like I had people looking up at me . I was proud . f was making money and I liked it .

A year or so before , I 'd really cared for her . I was washing cars then , and 1 had n't yet started to pay much attention to haircuts . I used a lot of grease on my hair and thought I was the best-looking guy in the world . One day I went into a coffeepot coffee shop and saw her . I wanted to pay for her coffee , but she hollered out in front of everybody , ' Instead of paying for my coffee , go and get yourself a haircut ! ' I felt terrible . I felt bad .

When I saw her a week later , she said , ' I hate you . ' I just laughed . " ( Dope pushing was not all laughs , girls and driving around in cars , however .

It bothered me most if the junky looked sick and begged for more stuff . " The whole thing bugged me up and I did n't feel right after a thing like that for days . I felt like God was going to get even with me for doing a thing like that . And often , after a beating , if I saw a bum on the street , I 'd give him five dollars . And I 'd feel as if I 'd evened the score with my Maker . I saw myself as a kind of Robin Hood , robbing the rich to give to the poor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd see one of those guys on Broadway playing an accordion , and I 'd put five or ten dollars in his hat .

At seventeen. , he was making more money than he 'd believed possible . ) " A whole lot or my money went for clothes . I wore white shirts , hand-rolled , from Paris , France . I wore genuine alligator shoes , buckles with my initials and stones on them , pinkie rings and a while coat . I also bought a cashmere suit , and 1 let everybody know it was cashmere . It had silk even inside the pants . I used to dream of having an all-chrome car and being a big gangster  --  the kind that everybody would look up to and say , ' Here conies Tony !

We 'd just destroy our clothes , throwing eggs all over the place . One night we spent forty dollars on eggs , buying them by the crate and throwing them around . " ( Eggs , girls , night clubs and cashmere suits . Tony thought it would last forever . Then . oil of a sudden , it came to an end . One night , when he and his older partner were walking along the street , a police detective stepped up quickly and arrested them .
