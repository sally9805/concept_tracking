Truce came to Korea in a stark , deliberately underplayed ceremony . <P> At Panmunjom , shortly before 10 a.m. ( the hour fixed for the signing ) , nervous little Communist sentries in baggy pants and wilting red epaulettes scurried about , brushing off the board walk where their masters were to tread . The bleak , new truce building , hastily and especially erected by the Reds , smelled of fresh pine . Outside , it still showed the marks of two big Picasso-style peace doves , put up by the Reds , taken down at Mark Clark 's demand . Inside it was stifling hot . Sweating U.N . observers and correspondents , including officers from each national contingent , filed in and sat on metal chairs at one side of the hall ; the Communist group sat at the other side . U.N . and Communist guards stood motionless around the walls . There were three large tables , one for documents , a second bearing a U.N . flag on a brass stand , the third with a North Korean flag similarly mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered . Lieut . General William K. Harrison , the U.N . senior delegate , tieless and without decorations , sat down at a table , methodically began to sign for the U.N . with his own ten-year-old fountain pen . North Korea 's starchy little Nam II , sweating profusely in his heavy tunic , his chest displaying a row of gold medals the size of tangerines , took his seat at the other table , signing for the enemy . Each man signed 18 copies of the main truce documents ( six each in English , Korean , Chinese ) , which aides carried back &; forth . The rumble of artillery still rolled through the building . Flashbulbs blazed and cameras whirred as the two chief delegates silently wrote . When they had finished , West Pointer Harrison and Nam II , schoolteacher in uniform , rose and departed without a word to each other , or even a nod or a handshake . <P> Without Fireworks . Outside , a correspondent asked a British officer whether the Commonwealth Division would celebrate with the traditional fireworks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to celebrate . Both sides have lost . " <P> Thus , 37 months and two days after the Russian-trained North Koreans attacked across the 38th parallel , the Korean war-a devastating struggle , laced from the start with glory , agony , triumph , frustration-came to a halt , perhaps temporary , perhaps permanent . The war had cost the U.S. more than 140,000 casualties ( some 25,000 dead , 102,000 wounded , 13,000 missing and captured ) , $22 billion . The problem of ending it had roweled the best brains of two U.S. Administrations , and had helped to win a national election for one , to lose it for the other . <P> Dull and Resigned . The almost-forgotten men of the war-the U.N . prisoners still in Communist hands-were expected to start coming back through the Panmunjom exchange site within a week . The latest prisoner list tendered by the Reds showed 3,313 Americans , 8,186 South Koreans , 922 British Commonwealth , 342 others . Enemy prisoners who had opted for repatriation were to be brought north at the rate of more than 2,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
