txt Chinese and North Korean Communists have massed sixty-three divisions against United Nations forces in Korea . This is the strongest enemy potential in the field at any time since the war began , General of the Army Douglas said today . With the present level of enemy divisions believed to be about 7,000 men each , the allied army faced more than 440,000 troops . The United Nations commander made his estimate of enemy strength in a communiqu ? that covered operations up to 6 A. M. today . At the front United Nations forces again patrolled north of the Thirty-eighth Parallel , feeling out positions from which the invaders seemed to be retiring while building up in the rear for a new offensive . In London , Foreign Secretary Herbert Morrison said " this is a psychological moment " for all parties to the warfare in Korea to bring it to an end . His remark was contained in a speech Monday night in which the Secretary set forth the principles that will guide him in office . He declared Britain would seek settlement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of appeasement . Enemy Is Regrouping General asserted the " enemy is engaged in tactical and strategic regrouping of major units " and added that new forces had appeared near the front to bolster some divisions badly battered in the early stages of Lieut . Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway 's " Operations Killer " offensive . For the past fortnight United Nations planes had observed the heaviest movement of convoys since the war began behind the enemy lines . The majority appeared headed for the central area around Kumhwa and some officers said an enemy blow down the cen // ter could be expected " at any moment . " Yesterday , however , was a day of light fighting with the enemy perhaps more interested in massing troops for a renewed offensive than in fighting off the methodically advancing United Nations tank and infantry probes with anything but small rear guards . " Several " United Nations patrols crossed the boundary between , North and South Korea during the past thirty-six hours , according to reports from the western front , near the spot where the Americans made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and infantry shot up enemy foxholes and bunkers , then again withdrew . One crossing , front-line reports said , was made northeast of Uijongbu in the valley of the Ildong River , a tributary of the Imjin , which is the largest water course in this sector . Tankers pushed two miles into North Korea . The second penetration , farther west , went about one mile north of the parallel . The patrol exchanged fire and silenced an enemy mortar before it returned . No Special Significance Military spokesmen said the penetrations had no special significance but could be considered part of the routine patrolling constantly under way ahead of the ' main bodies of the United Nations troops thus far still south of the , border . Lack of strong Communist reaction , they stated , apparently indicated the enemy also attached ' no particular importance to the defense of the Parallel ' as such . Along most of the front fighting dwindled yesterday . The small scale of the combat was indicated by the Eighth Army 's estimate of 340 enemy casualties on Sunday ? the smallest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January . Resistance Slight Resisitance was " light and scattered , " Army headquarters said , where the United States advance guard probed for Communist positions north and northeast of Uijbngbu . The communiqu ? said reconnaissance was made " in the area of Songdong , " one mile north of the Korean bounndary . This is the cosest official accounts have come to stating that the Parallel had been crossed in the west , though correspondents as early as last Saturday had accompanied patrols across . Headquarters said " limited advances " were made in the west and center , with only patrol activities and little or no contact in the east . There was no report of enemy activity on the east coast , where South Koreans were last reported beyond Yangyang and advancing under the protection of naval gunfire from the Sea of Japan . The largest body of enethy troops reported engaged with the United Nations advance was one platoon , which was dispersed in action near Songdong . A Chinese patrol that tried to cross the Imjin River near Sokpo , on the western front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported.
