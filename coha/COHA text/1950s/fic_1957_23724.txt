THE LOVERS M R. STRINGER was a conductor on the " D " train going hack and forth all day between 205th Street in the Bronx and Coney Island . Mr. Stringer stood outside on the platform joining the two middle cars of the train and he would open the doors when they were in a station and then , leaning forward slightly and looking first one way and then the next to see that the doors were clear , he would press the small button at his side that would close them and then he would give the signal for the motorman to start the train . Mr. Stringer had been working for the New York subway system for over twenty years . He had been a track man and then a station attendant . He worked in a change booth for two years and he had finally become a conductor and , while he would sometimes think of it with the old pull of ambition waking in him for a brief passing moment , he had by this time resigned himself to the fact that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorman . Now Mr. Stringer lived in the Bronx , off Tremont Avenue . He had been married for twenty-two years and he was the father of one married daughter and two sons , one of whom was studying at Columbia to become a lawyer , while the other was studying to become a dentist at the New York University dental college on Twenty-third Street . Mr. Stringer was a calm , very easy-going , and contented man . He was liked by almost everyone , and there were few people he had ever met whom he did not like . He had been a great movie fan before television and he and his wife would attend the Tremont Theater two or three times a week , depending on how often the program was changed . With the advent of television , he became even more enthusiastic about the new medium than he had ever been about the movies , and his wife , who was a small , delicate , and sweet woman , joined him in his new enthusiasm almost with the vigor she might have displayed had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lived from day to day with little effort really and if he had been asked by anyone , he most surely would have replied that , of course , he was a happy man . But then one day something happened that was destined to change the entire course of Mr. Stringer 's calm , easy-going , and contented life . A lady wearing a blue coat and a red hat asked him if she was on the right train to Coney Island Avenue and he assured her she was . " They just changed the trains around this week , " he told her . " I see , " said the lady . " I read it on the big poster they had hanging up in the train , but I did n't understand exactly what it was about . " " Do n't worry , " said Mr. Stringer with a confi-dential sort of smile that was mostly in his eyes . " Everybody 's asking questions about it . Excuse me . I have to open the doors . " " Certainly . " He returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a big mix-up for everybody , " he said . " Is that right ? " she asked . She seemed somewhat impressed . " Oh sure ! " he nodded emphatically . A baby cradled in the arms of a great fat red-faced woman suddenly began bawling and the fat lady began rocking him back and forth with a gentleness that seemed pleasantly odd for the size of her body . A man in a brown raincoat glanced down over the top of his newspaper at the bawling infant and merely watched for several moments , completely impassive . " It takes time for people to get used to something like that , " Mr. Stringer added . " Is it quicker than what it was on the BMT ? " she asked him . " Much quicker ! " he said . There was a feeling of casual pride in the tone of his voice as he said this . " And between you and me , " he said in a softer , even more confidential voice , " it 's a better train to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those trains for junk . " " They were very well built cars in their day , " Mr. Stringer said . " A remarkable achievement of engineering . " " Were they really ? " He nodded . Then : " Excuse me . I have to open the doors . " " Certainly . " It was a forty-five minute ride to the Coney Island station and Mr. Stringer kept returning to the lady who was seated in the corner right by his door and they talked of subway cars and how terrible it was during the rush hour and she told him she had been shopping in New York , at Gimbel 's , she went to Macy 's sometimes , but actually she thought Gimbel 's was cheaper for most things . " You would n't really think so , " she said . " But it 's true . " " Is that right ? " " Everybody thinks because Macy 's is so big , it 's cheaper , " she said . " But Gimbel 's is just as big . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores are open late , " Mr. Stringer told her . " Especially at Thirty-fourth Street ! Terrible , terrible ! It 's worse almost than the rush hour . Everybody 's got packages . Every-body 's bumping into everybody else 's packages . It 's something ! " " I can imagine , " the lady said . She looked at him with a certain sympathy as he nodded the echo to his own words . " It 's something all right , " he said . " It must be very hard on you . " " After so many years , you forget how hard it is , ' ' he said . " I try to do all my shopping during the day . I do n't like big crowds . " " I do n't blame you . Excuse me again . " " Certainly : " When they reached Van Sicklen Avenue , which was the stop before Coney Island , Mr. Stringer asked the lady what her name was and she told him it was Mrs. Polly Ashroon . " My name is Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really Jacob , but everybody calls me Jake . " " I like the name Jacob , " said Mrs. Polly Ashroon . " Perhaps you 'll come and ride on my train again , " he said when they came to Coney Island . " I hope so too , " she said . Two drunks wobbled out of the train onto the wide platform . The sun was a golden disc low in the west . The skeleton of a roller coaster cut its gleaming shadow through the sun . Far off , like a green haze in the light , was the ocean . " It was a pleasure talking to you , " he said . " Likewise , " she said with a gentle smile . He saw that she had brown eyes . Her face was round and had a look of softness to it , the beginning of fat perhaps . Her nose was a little too small for the size of her face and from certain angles gave her the appearance of a doll not too finely made . After a moment she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is where I get off . " " Good-by , Mrs. Ashroon . " And he thought about the lady all the way home to Tremont Avenue in the Bronx . N 0 W Mr. Stringer was a sensible man and though he admitted he had found the lady 's company very pleasurable , he knew that he would never see her again . He saw so many hundreds , even thousands of people every day . For a moment , thinking of it as he was , he found himself amazed that there could be so many completely different faces . And then he was a little surprised that he had never noticed this before . Why , he would have to go through millions of faces before he 'd ever come to hers again , there were that many . But the following day he did look for her and the day after that and even the next day and then , after he had given up hope completely of ever seeing her again , he saw her one day on the Thirty-fourth Street platform and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way to Coney Island . Mr. Stringer told Mrs. Ashroon how happy he was to see her . She had been shopping in Gimbel 's for a new frying pan and some pot holders and she had ended by buying herself a white nylon blouse . " I really needed it though , " she told him . " I have n't had a new blouse for over a year . " You know , you wear very attractive hats , Mrs. Ashroon , " he told her . She seemed surprised by his compliment . She did not even have time for several seconds to be pleased . Then she looked up as if she could see her own hat and she smiled and thanked him . " I liked the red one you wore the other day too , " he said . " That one ? It 's years old , " she said . " This one I made myself . " " You made it yourself ? Really ? " She nodded . Both her hands were folded over the package in her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly across the way . " It 's very nice , I 'm telling you , " Mr. Stringer said . " Excuse me . " That was on Wednesday . On Friday , she was waiting again on the Thirty-fourth Street platform , her arms full of packages . He told her it was like a miracle almost they should keep meeting and she smiled with a faint blush touching her cheeks and she said , yes it was . When he met her again the following Monday , he was overjoyed . He could not believe his eyes and he told her so . And this time she confessed to him that she had waited on the platform for his train to come . She had waited for almost an hour . And she blushed deeply now and turned her eyes away from him as if something off to the side had caught her attention . " Excuse me , " he said . " Just a minute . " She nodded , still not looking at him . " You really waited ? " he asked her when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't tell you , " she said . " I 'm glad , " he said . " I 'm glad and you should tell me . If you knew how glad I was . Listen , I was looking every day for you . " Again she avoided his eyes and her face turned a pink color and he could see it this time and lie wanted to say something to her to tell her it was all right , she did not have to feel this way , but he did not know what to say . Now , for the first time since they had met , she was afraidsomeone sitting nearby would hear them . She was sure everyone was listening to them . She wanted to tell him to speak more softly , but she did n't . " I really did look for you , " he said . " Honest , I ca n't tell you how glad I am . " So they met regularly , three times a week , on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays . She would always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock and her arms would always be filled with packages from Gimbel 's and occasionally one or two from Macy 's . By this time , he had told her all about his wife and his three children and she had told him about her husband who was a dry-goods salesman and she had one boy who was married and who was the manager of a restaurant on Forty-sixth Street called Maxie 's .. She asked him if he had ever been there and he thought for a moment , but he could not remember any place by that name that he had ever been to . He did not eat very often in restaurants , A T HOME , Mr. Stringer gave no sign to his wife of his interest in Mrs. Polly Ashroon . His wife sa.w no difference in him . At night , they would still sit on the sofa in the living-room and watch television for two or three hours after dinner and then they would retire to bed . On Sundays they would sometimes visit their married daughter , who lived in Jackson Heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too cold for a walk or if it would be raining , they would go to a movie . And somehow , Mr. Stringer did not permit his feeling for Mrs. Polly Ashroon to interfere in any way with how he felt about his wife . It seemed to him to be a completely separate matter . He knew he loved his wife and Mrs. Polly Ashroon was no more than a very dear friend . Then one Wednesday , when she got on his train at Thirty-fourth Street , he noticed a kind of excitement in her eyes and her round face was slightly flushed . He did not ask her if anything was the matter . They talked of usual matters . She told him there had been a sale on towels at Macy 's and she had bought a half-dozen . A lot of her bath towels were beginning to wear out . " My husband , he used to get hotel towels all the time , " she explained . " But now he does n't travel so much anymore . They were only ninety-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , she took a small package out of the big shopping bag she was carrying and she handed it to him . Mr. Stringer was not sure exactly what she wanted him to do . She smiled . " It 's for you , " she said in a voice suddenly almost too soft under the rattling of the train for him to hear . " 1 hope you do n't mind . They had souse handkerchiefs . Go ahead , open it , " He stared into her face , hardly believing she had clone this , smiling , only a moment . Then : " Excuse me ? " He jumped up . The train had been stopped for over thirty seconds and several of the passengers standing by the door looked over at him impatiently . A tall very striking brunette carrying a hatbox suddenly banged on the door in a nervous fragile way . When he returned , lie sat down beside her and he opened the package . There were three white linen handkerchiefs with his initials in raised pale blue letters . did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I can exchange them if you do n't . " He fingered each of them separately , almost as if to make sure they were real . He was smiling and he was embarrassed . A dark tiny woman in a polka dot dress was watching them frosts across the car . " I like them very much with initials , " he said finally . " What ? I ca n't hear you . " He looked up at her . " I 'm sorry . I said I like them very much with initials . " " You 're sure ? " He nodded . " They 're beautiful handkerchiefs . " " I did n't know what you 'd like , " she said . " I do n't even know how to say thank you . " . " Do n't be foolish , " she said . " They 're very beautiful . " " If you like them , I 'm glad . " That Friday , he waited until they were almost to Van Sicklen Avenue before he handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been afraid that perhaps she would open it and not want to take it from him , because he had bought her a six and a half dollar bottle of perfume . He had never before in his life bought perfume for a woman , not even for his wife . The girl in the store had told him it was from France and one of the finest perfumes he could buy . " Do n't open it yet , " he said . " Wait till later : " " You should n't have , " she said . " I only hope you like it . " " What is it ? Why ca n't I open it now ? " " You 'll see later , " he said . " Please . " She smiled very warmly , closing down her eyes as she did to tiny slits in the fat that seemed to swell up about them and she pressed his hand as she got up to leave and when she was gone he could feel his entire body trembling and he hoped that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had touched him in all the time they had known each other and he was completely unable to control his joy . All the way back to 205th Street , he stood outside on the platform , with both doors closed , feeling the draft rush against him through the dark tunnel . He did not once go inside the train . The faces on each station were like silent masks hanging in a dim light . He wanted to be alone and he wanted to keep on remembering that one moment for as long as he could , without forgetting a single detail , and he wanted to continue feeling the glow and warmth that had suddenly taken on a new huge growing kind of life inside of him . B U T on his way home that night , the glow and the warmth left him . The streets , once so familiar , that he had walked a countless number of times , were now strange and drab , heavy with the burden of a world he suddenly could feel himself no part of . The memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a moment , given shape to was soon mixed in his mind with thoughts of how now he could no longer deceive himself that Mrs. Ashroon was no more than a very dear friend . All that evening , as he and his wife sat on the sofa watching television , he could not wipe the image of Mrs. Polly Ashroon from his mind and in bed that night , unable to sleep , but lying perfectly still so as not to wake his wife , he knew in his heart that he had fallen in love with her and it was a kind of love he was sure he had never known before in his entire life . But he said nothing to Mrs. Polly Ashroon when he saw her on Monday . She was wearing the perfume he had given her . It had a fragrance that was sweet and deeply sensual . She told him it was one of the most beautiful gifts she had ever received . And she would wear it only on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays . So it continued for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after day whether or not he should ask to see her perhaps an a Saturday . It could not go on this way with all the strange prying eyes and loud voices and the rattling of the train as a backdrop . He could tell his wife he was working an extra day , which he sometimes did when men were on vacation or if more than the normal number were sick at the same time and they were short . Perhaps they could meet and have lunch and walk in the park . They could see a movie if she wanted . But he kept putting off asking her . He was afraid that if he did , perhaps she would say no and then she would never come back to see him and he knew now that he would not he able to bear that . Quite without his noticing it ( for he had tried to tell himself at first that he would never have let it happen ) she had become the entire meaning of his life . He loved her . He was sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never felt before . It was the sort of feeling , emotion , he had seen many times in the movies . He would rarely think of it , but every now and again , it would occur to him that real people like himself never loved in such a way as was almost always depicted upon the screen . Surely he could not expect to love his wife the way a fellow such as Clark Gable , for example , loved a woman like Linda Darnell or one of the others . These people inhabited a world that was as different from his world as the moon is front the core of an apple . But what lie felt now for this woman , he knew was that other , impossible , wild kind of love that ruled men , destroyed them , made them kings or beggars and always seemed to be played out to wonderful music . This last thought , of the music , amused him for a moment ; he smiled , rubbing the back of his neck with one hand . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was no putting it off . He knew that one day , sooner or later , he would have to tell her . Whether she went away or not , he would have to tell her . But he kept pushing the day off , telling himself there was time enough . They had known each other only several months . And then if lie did tell her , what would they be able to do ? What would he tell his wife ? What would his children think of their father falling in love with another woman ? There were dozens of questions that pounded back and forth in his brain , finding no answers but in the simple fact of his loving her . And he realized , almost to the point of being completely horrified , that he cared now absolutely nothing about what his wife would do , what his children would think of him . His entire life now found its focus in this woman ; the world was suddenly two people as it had never been before . And it frightened him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing can happen to a man . It was , at the same time , both terrible and wonderful and it was something that was not very easy to believe . A N D then one day , when they came to Van Sickles Avenue , she told him that she would never be able to see him again . Her husband had been transferred to a better job in the Chicago office of his firm and they were moving on Saturday . Mr. Stringer could not believe his ears . He told himself lie was dreaming . " I wanted to tell you sooner , " she said . As soon as I found out . But I could n't . I tried . Honest , believe me . I tried . I just could n't . Now I 'm getting out at the next stop . " " No . . . " He was shaking his head as if he had been stunned by a physical blow . He closed his eyes and ran his thumb and forefinger across his brows to . clear his head that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " she said . " Honest . .. " " Wait . " He took hold of her hand . He knew people were watching them ; he did not care . " At least ride hack with me so we can talk , " lie said . " I ca n't . I 'm late already , " she said . " Tonight , my husband 's people are coming over for dinner . They 're coining from Jersey . And I 'm late . " " Then just a few stops , " he pleaded . " I ca n't ... " COLE CITES MONOGAMY " You can . .. " " I only wish I could . " " Just to Borough Hall , " he said . " I 've got to talk to you . We never really talked . I 've got to tell you so much . " " I know , " she said , shaking her head . " I know . ? . " " We 've got to talk . " She shook her head no and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to the point of tears . ' ' Please , " she said . " No . . . do n't go , " he said . " Please believe me when I tell you I do n't want to , " she said . " Jake , please believe me . I 'm not lying . I want to talk too . I want to tell you things . But I 've got to go . I 've got . to . Please believe me , I do n't want to go ... " ' this last she said almost as if she felt forced to plead with him now only to be believed . " I do n't want to go . " " If you only knew . . . " " No . . . " She drew her hand slowly out of his . " Do n't , " she whispered . " People arc looking . Please , " she said . Then the train stopped . Mr. Stringer did not move . All the people in the train were on their feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sitting in the corner , his hands hanging limply on his knees . A small boy asked his mother if that was the man who was supposed to open the door . He heard people in other cars banging on the doors and a man shouted from the next car in a great deep voice , " Okay , open up these doors ! " Mrs. Polly Ashroon , with all the people in the car now watching , reached down and pressed his hand in a very warm and intimate way and when he looked up at her , she whispered in a very gentle voice , " Please ... " That was all she said . Slowly he got up and slid open the door and he stood out on the metal steps between the cars and he pressed the button at his side that opened the doors and the people moved like a rolling wave out onto the platform and down the wide stone ramps that led to the street . Mrs. Ashroon was the last to leave the car . On the platform , she stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train and she said , " Please . . . " making almost a question out of the word this time and Mr. Stringer staring down into her round flushed face , merely nodded , and they looked at each other for another moment without either of them speaking and then she turned and made her way slowly down the stone ramp , not looking back . Standing there between the cars , Mr. Stringer knew that he would never see her again and he knew that never in the awful years to come would his heart again feel the warmth , the beauty , and the agony he could feel at this moment for a woman he would always love .
