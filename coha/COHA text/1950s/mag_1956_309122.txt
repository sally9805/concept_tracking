Prime Minister Nehru hopped spryly onto the rostrum of India 's Parliament last week and waved a 641-page , blue-backed volume at the sea of faces before him . " This is the mighty theme of a nation building and remaking itself , " he cried . " We had something worthwhile in our first Five-Year Plan and we made good to some extent . This second Five-Year Plan is the real beginning . We have to start from scratch . " <P> <P> Scratch is the word for it . India 's vast country has 300 million illiterates , 80% of its population ; in its 500,000 villages there are scarcely 250,000 schools . India has almost as many unemployed as the U.S. has jobholders ( 68 million ) - and the number of job seekers rises by 2,000,000 every year . Yet in its first Five-Year Plan India managed to boost food output by 18% , to make itself ( given good weather ) largely self-sufficient for food . Across the Himalayas , where a rival drama of planned advance is being enacted , the totalitarian techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . <P> This time , doubling its planned outlay to $15 billion , India is driving toward industrialization . The goals ( trebling steel production , increasing aluminum output sevenfold ) may seem extravagant , considering the financial means in sight ( India must raise a whopping $1.6 billion in overseas aid , more than three times the $500 million the U.S. sent during the first plan ) ; but nothing less will keep pace with the growth and hopes of India 's population . Telling his followers that " it will take many five-year plans before we can bring about a Socialist society , " Nehru realistically last week persuaded parliamentary hotheads to reject a measure which would clamp a $5,000-a-year ceiling on income . " Socialism does not mean a dead level of poverty , " he snapped .
