On the parade ground of the Korean Military Academy just outside Seoul , President Syngman Rhee and General ( ret . ) James Van Fleet climbed into a black jeep for a special review of the cadet corps . For both men it was a big day ; both had worked hard for it , both had waited for it eagerly . There , on a site that lay along Van Fleet 's " Golden Line " the location of what was to be 1951 's last-ditch stand against the Communists - the four-year-old academy last week graduated its first class . Guns boomed , the band blared , sabers flashed in the sun . " Today , " said President Rhee. " is just like a dream to me . " <P> It was a dream come true for the entire nation . When K.M.A. was founded in 1951 , the South Korean army officers ' corps had as confusing a background as the country 's history itself . Some officers had been trained with the Japanese . Some had served with the Chinese Nationalists , a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to the U.S. or had taken short R.O.T.C. courses . In 1951 , with $500 out of his own pocket . Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet started the drive for a permanent academy . <P> Dollars &; Engineers . U.N . and Korean troops raised $190,000 for the K.M.A. Foundation Fund . A special G.I. welfare fund gave $60,000 more , and the U.S. Government sent $500,000 for books and laboratory equipment . The U.S. Army 's Korean Military Advisory Group furnished advisers . West Point sent sets of instruction manuals . <P> Today the academy has 800 cadets living in Quonset huts near the red brick and concrete administration and classroom buildings . Since the curriculum is modeled closely on West Point 's , K.M.A. is not only South Korea 's chief military school , but also its top engineering school . Like West Pointers , the cadets get basic liberal arts plus huge doses of mathematics and science . But all must master English , the professional language of the school , and then take two years of either Russian , Chinese , French or German . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public-address system blares out : " Good morning ! Did you sleep well ? " By 6 a.m. the cadets are outside for reveille formation . They line up by companies , each of which bears an animal 's name , e.g. , White Horse , Antelope , Panther . They count off , sing the national anthem , repeat the armed forces oath , ending with a fiery pledge to unify the country ( " Let us plant the Republic of Korea colors on Paektu-san* and wash our swords in the Yalu River ! " ) . <P> Though there is less hazing than at West Point , first-year men must swab the barracks , serve in the mess hall , stand motionless whenever a North Star ( four-year man ) passes by . Demerits come for everything from dozing in class to " questioning an officer " -a rule designed to keep cadets from humiliating inexperienced instructors with tricky questions .
