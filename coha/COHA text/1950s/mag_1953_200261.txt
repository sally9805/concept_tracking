College , for many an oldtime minister , was where his young people lost their faith . And this was just true enough for those experiment-minded conservatives , the Missouri Synod Lutherans , to see what they could do about it . What they did has grown into a chain of churches as live-wire and enthusiastic as any in the country , with congregations made up entirely of college students . <P> The movement began to pick up headway in 1940 , when the Missouri Synod appointed Dr. Reuben William Hahn executive secretary of the Student Service Commission in Chicago . Today , the commission directs study groups on more than 1.000 campuses ; on 32 , Lutheran students have their own chapels . This week Dr. Hahn dedicated the newest chapel at the University of Alabama . <P> " Hi , Joe ! " Each student church is established by the local church district and is directly responsible to it . Sometimes it takes Hahn a long time to convince a district that it should set one up . " There are still some who think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church , " he explains . " They think we are spoiling the students . Experience shows that we are not spoiling the youth but . . . making functioning Christians out of them . " <P> How this is done is well demonstrated at Calvary Lutheran Chapel , on the campus of the University of Wisconsin . Last week , as on any typical Sunday , the day began with a 9:30 a.m. service , followed by another service at 11 . By 2:30 p.m .. the Calvary touch-football team was practicing for a game with the Catholic student chapel next door . At 5:45 , the wood-paneled recreation room in the basement was filled with students who had come for the weekly " cost supper " - spaghetti , salad , ice cream , cake and coffee for 40 . <P> Most of them wore name tags , and each newcomer was called upon to stand and be welcomed with a cheer- " Hi , Joe ! Hi , Mary ! " - with crew-cut Pastor Ed Wessling acting as M.C. <P> Apples &; Amens . Next came a movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life , which led to a discussion session on faith . Before 8. the group went upstairs into the chapel again for a candlelit vesper service . The evening ended in the lounge with Mclntosh apples , talk and " schafskopf , " a relative of rummy . <P> Calvary is sponsored jointly by the Wisconsin Synod and the Missouri Synod Lutherans , but it is run by a student council and popular 29-year-old Pastor Wessling , who wants to specialize in student work . College chapels like Calvary , he feels , can be a healthy new way of reaching young people . <P> The young members of his congregation give a hearty amen to that . " Having our own chapel makes us feel much more at home than in a normal congregation , " said one of them last week . " I 'm doing a lot more here than I would at home . "
