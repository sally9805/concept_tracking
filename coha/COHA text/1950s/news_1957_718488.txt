txt iniscent of earlier days when the Soviet Union was the pariah of the world . Its diplomats in all Western countries , and in the United Nations , are being shunned . One of them asked a State Department official when Americans would start coming to their receptions again . He laid himself open to the cool answer , " When you get your troops out of Hungary . " Mr. Khrushchev and Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin had expected to make a grand tour of Scandinavia this season . They had been given an invitation , with date unspecified , when the Premiers of ? Norway , Sweden , and Denmark visited Moscow last year . The invitations are being left suspended . They never have been withdrawn . But the date has not been fixed . The episode of the threat to send " volunteers " to the Middle East has been answered by a perceptible stiffening of the Washington tone . Friendship Alienated For months Secretary of State John Foster Dulles has talked and behaved as though he regarded Soviet influence in the Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is different . The United States Sixth Fleet in the eastern Mediterranean has been " beefed up . " Its commander has disclosed that he carries atomic weapons in his magazines . There is talk in Washington , although still only in the talk stage , of earmarking United States military units as the potential Middle East force in case it should be necessary to implement the new " Dulles resolution . " Moscow 's venture In Hungary is still an unsolved problem for the men of the Kremlin which continues to hurt them in many ways . They have not been able to crush the Hungarian spirit of resistance . Nor have they been able to arrange the formation of a new government in Hungary which would be acceptable to the Hungarians . is that Moscow The net of it from the world is more isolated since the 1920 's , than it has been what , its leaders when it lived in called a " state of sometimes siege . " It is not in a state of siege Pattern Of Diplomacy today . No government anywhere is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States policy is not " leaning " against either the Soviet Union itself , or its empire . Yet by its own actions Moscow has undone most of the good will which Mr. Khrushchev built up during 1955 when , accompanied by Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin , he was the happy traveler roaming around Europe making friends . He and his colleagues in Moscow are getting the cold-shoulder treatment from the outside world . They may think that this is deliberately managed from Washington , but that is not the case . No country ever alienated so much readiness to friendship in so short a time as Moscow alienated by its behavior in Hungary . What will the effect be on the leaders in Moscow ? Repercussions Echo If they had only foreign relations to worry about , they might be relatively relaxed . But their now isolation has domestic repercussions . Ever since World War II they have benefited economically from their ability to milk their satellites . That policy has run out . Hungary has became an economic liability . Poland has insisted on fair trade . Concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even Romania to head off a repetition of the Hungarian story in those countries . The satellite empire has become both a military and an economic liability . This has increased the burden at home . Satellite economies have to be aided from Soviet resources , instead of the other way around . Satellite armies have to be watched and policed by Soviet armies instead of being a military addition . And the shadow of doubt about the all-wisdom of Soviet policy has been carried inside the Soviet body politic by students from satellite countries attending Soviet universities . Moscow is having troubles . They manifest themselves in the new irritability of Mr. Khrushchev . Does it go any deeper ? We in the West do not know . The " spirit of Geneva " is not totally dead . The Eisenhower reply to the Bulganin note of Nov , 17 was published this week . Its tone was cool rather than hostile , but distinctly cool , and very brief . Mr. Eisenhower was not interested in a new summit conference ? not while Soviet tanks still roam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
