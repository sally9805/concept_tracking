Cook County State 's Attorney John S. Boyle suspected there was dirty work afoot , and he put his suspicions in a letter to the Chicago Tribune . " I have received many complaints from police officers , " wrote he , " concerning the manner in which . . . Richard Tracy lives . They refer to his $100,000 home , 1951 Cadillac convertible . . . They are sort of hinting that a grand jury investigation might be a very helpful thing for the community . " <P> Boyle was not alone ; many another reader had written to the newspapers to complain about Detective Dick Tracy 's suspiciously high standard of living . Their question : Has the nation 's favorite funny-page detective been a grafter all these years ? The uproar was so loud that it reached the ears of Tracy 's strip father , Cartoonist Chester Gould . He decided to have Pat Patton , the strip 's police chief and Tracy 's boss , call Tracy in last week for an explanation . Even from Dick Tracy , the nemesis of criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracy : " I 've had a steady job here . . . for 20 years . I was a bachelor for almost 19 of those 20 years , and a penny pincher ! <P> <P> I saved my dough ! ... I bought that old corner property during the real estate depression . . . for $3,600 . . . There 's a nice little plaster-a mortgage . " <P> And the big car ? Well , said Tracy somewhat sheepishly , he had made a little deal which he had kept secret . An auto manufacturer sold him the car cheap so he could use it to test special police gadgets . But the explanations were n't enough , especially since $500,000 in jewels and cash , held as evidence in police cases , was missing from the police vaults . <P> The fuller explanation of Cartoonist Gould was no more convincing . Said he : " I do n't exactly know Dick 's salary , but I do know that he 's always been pretty much of a Scotchman . Hell , he saved his money . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think he spent much more than $25,000 for it . " He is n't sure how big the modern mansion really is . His daughter , Jean , had drawn the plans , never got beyond the first floor , which contains a mere six rooms . As for the car , well , it is n't exactly a Cadillac , and it is two years old anyway . <P> At week 's end , Dick Tracy had 24 hours to clear himself . In the never-never land of the comics , the 24 hours would take seven weeks . But Chet Gould was confident : " Utmost faith-that 's exactly what I have in old Dick . There 's no mystery about his finances . . . He 's an honest guy . "
