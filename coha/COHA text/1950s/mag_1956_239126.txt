Out of a blur of planeborne and trainborne candidates , of parades , rallies and TV shows , the 1956 campaign began to take recognizable shape . One month before Election Day what the candidates and their parties said , did and planned increasingly tended to conform to these factors : <P> <P> There are no burning issues : Truman , McCarthy , time for a change , mink coats , depression , boys in foxholes and Alger Hiss lie muted beneath the surface . The Eisenhower health issue has been knocked out by Ike 's robust appearance , and the Nixon issue is undermined by Nixon 's own high-level campaigning . There are , however , some intense regional issues , e.g. , the farm program in the Midwest , local unemployment problems in such states as Indiana and Michigan , segregation in the South . <P> There is no feeling or preaching of crusade in either camp . Without it , victory , at least for local candidates , depends heavily on organization-who gets out the registration , who gets out the vote . In numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized Republicans , a situation that the Republicans are working hard to change . <P> Adlai Stevenson has only a small , personal following among Democrats . In many parts of the U.S. , he draws crowds that are undemonstrative ; his looks , his voice , his personality , according to New York Times reporters roving the Middle West , generally have little appeal . ( " Eisenhower is ordinary-like , " said a gasoline-station attendant in Oceana County , Mich. , " and so is Kefauver . " ) Expounding on " The Case for the Democrats " in last week 's Saturday Evening Post , House Speaker Sam Rayburn managed to write 4,500 words of a 4,700-word article before mentioning the candidate 's name . Stevenson 's campaign managers are well aware of their problem , are carefully following the " reverse coattails " strategy ( TIME , Sept. 10 ) of linking Stevenson with local candidates and local issues . <P> By contrast Dwight Eisenhower is still , after four years in office , phenomenally popular . From coast to coast local Republican candidates are reaching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preelection schedule of personal campaigning . Most prognosticating to date has the Democrats picking up momentum and moving into position to challenge seriously the whole Republican ticket . But the fact seems to be that , at midpoint , the Republicans are doing well at the national level , not so well at the local level . Last week top G.O.P. campaign strategists met in Washington , saw no reason to change their basic plans . Reason : in the month before election Dwight Eisenhower is clearly in the lead .
