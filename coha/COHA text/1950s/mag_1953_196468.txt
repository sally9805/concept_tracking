At the Jewel City Bowl in Glendale , Calif. , 300 spectators gathered for an unusual bowling event . They had come not to watch bowlers but machines . As a bowler sent his ball crashing into the tenpins , the ball hit the cushion , set off an automatic switch . Almost before a spectator could say " Strike , " an intricate machine swept the alley clean of pins , set them in place on a rack , dropped a second set of pins into place , and sent the ball back to the bowler . It was an impressive demonstration of the American Machine &; Foundry Co. ' s new automatic pinspotting machine , in operation for the first time on the West Coast . Last week Jewel City totted up the results of its first two weeks with the pinspotters : business was 30% better than it had ever been before . Said Proprietor Hugo Kohn : " Yessir , it looks as though these machines will revolutionize bowling . " <P> There was no doubt in the mind of A.M.F. President Morehead Patterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already the fastest-growing participation sport ; the machines should give it a big boost . They not only replace hard-to-find pin boys but they enable bowling alleys to stay open 24 hours a day , a big advantage in industrial communities where teams on different shifts bowl round the clock . Already A.M.F. has installed more than 800 in bowling alleys , plans to step up production to 250 per month next year . Even so , it will take years to supply the 60,000 U.S. alleys , especially since new ones are being added at the rate of 2,500 a year . By renting its pinspotters for an average of 12 a game ( about the same cost as pin boys ) , A.M.F. expects to gross $22 million a year from the machines by 1960 . <P> Comfortable Cushion . The pin-spotter is also symptomatic of the revolution that has taken place in the American Machine &; Foundry Co . Formed in 1900 as the cigarette machine-making subsidiary of James Duke 's tobacco trust , A.M.F. became an independent firm after the trust was broken up in 1911 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an American Tobacco Co. vice president , A.M.F. developed the first cigarmaking machine . With a patent monopoly in the field , A.M.F. was able to charge the entire cost of the machine ( about $4,800 ) upon installation , then collect a royalty of $1 for every 1,000 cigars produced . The company then expanded into bakery machines and specialized sewing machines , many of which it also rented out . <P> Morehead Patterson ( Yale ' 20 , Oxford , and Harvard Law School ' 24 ) joined his father 's firm in 1926 after he had taken a one-year fling at the law . He watched the company , with its cushion of royalties , sail through the Depression , paying dividends every year . But he decided that no company could expect to live on its patents forever . Says Patterson : " We could tell by 1938 that after 1946 we were going to have dividends of only half of what we had been counting on . " <P> Hardening Arteries . He began to look for a new machine for a relatively unmechanized market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pinspotting machine from Fred Schmidt , the inventor , even though nobody before had ever succeeded in perfecting such a device . Finally , after 14 years , a satisfactory model was produced. *
