At a conference of the International Council of Scientific Unions in London , Sterling P. Newberry of the General Electric Co. last week told about the invention of an instrument that scientists have coveted for years . It is a new X-ray microscope , developed by Newberry and Selby E. Summers at the G.E . laboratory in Schenectady . <P> Scientists have never been able to get a magnified X-ray look at internal structures through ordinary optical microscopes , since X rays can not be focused by optical lenses like ordinary light . The best X rays can do is to cast shadows of the objects that they have passed through . <P> Usually , the shadows are ill-defined because the source of the X rays is comparatively large ( e.g. as in an X-ray chest plate ) . As the source grows smaller , the sharpness of the shadows increases . <P> In the G.E . microscope , the X rays are generated by an electron beam that is focused by electronic lenses on a spot only one-100,000th of an inch in diameter , 300 times smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from this tiny pinpoint cast shadows so sharp that they keep their definition even when thrown on a fluorescent screen or photographic film with 1,500 diameters of magnification . <P> According to Newberry , the new instrument will permit biologists , for the first time , to examine microscopically the interiors of such small living organisms as fruit flies and germinating seeds . It will aid the study of the internal fine structure of metals , paints , plastics and other materials . In medicine , it will enable pathologists to study small-scale ailments such as tooth decay and hardening of the arteries .
