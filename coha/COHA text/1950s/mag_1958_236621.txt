Virginia 's Democratic Senator Harry Flood Byrd , 70 , spent most of one afternoon last week at his cluttered desk , writing a statement in painstaking longhand . Writing done , he reread it , handed it to an aide , slipped out of his office with his black cocker spaniel , Happy , frisking at his heels , and took off that night for a Tucson hideaway . What he had written made headlines next morning : after 43 years in public office , Harry Byrd , chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee and the nation 's most dedicated fighter for pay-as-you-go fiscal conservatism , had decided not to stand for reelection this year . His reason : he had promised his wife that 1952 would be his last campaign . " Since then , " wrote Harry Byrd , " she has suffered a crippling illness and is an invalid ; it is our desire to spend our lives together at home in Virginia . " <P> Harry Byrd 's pay-as-you-go philosophy was personal as well as political ; from boyhood , he paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of one of Virginia 's first families , * its fortunes were depleted when , at 15 , he took over his father 's down-and-out Winchester Star , worked part-time as a telephone operator to buy newsprint-which he paid for on a day-to-day basis . The paper prospered and , with its earnings , Byrd leased an apple orchard . He now owns about 7,000 acres and is the world 's largest individual apple grower . <P> Elected to the state senate in 1915 , Harry Byrd led a bitter fight for pay-as-you-go road building as against bond financing , won in a referendum , carried on his model highway program after his election as governor in 1925 . Governor Byrd pushed through a tough antilynch law , streamlined the state constitution . In the fight for adoption of his changes , he built the famed Virginia Democratic political organization that stands today as one of the nation 's oldest and most successful-and Harry Byrd will continue to run it after his Senate retirement . <P> Longtime Break . In his days in Richmond , Byrd was described as Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Byrd did not change ; times did , beginning in 1933-That year Byrd was appointed to the Senate , replacing Claude Swanson , who had been named Navy Secretary by Franklin Roosevelt . One of Byrd 's first Senate votes was cast for Roosevelt 's one attempt to carry out his campaign pledge for economy : a half billion cut in federal spending , mostly in veteran 's benefits . But with NRA and its $3 billion relief provision , Byrd broke with Roosevelt-and stayed broken , both with F.D.R. and his successor , Harry Truman , who once snapped that there were " too many Byrds in the Senate .
