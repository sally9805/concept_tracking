A light rain sifted down on southeast Florida one night last week as the 62-ft. cabin cruiser Harpoon eased out of a remote cove near Miami and zigzagged through mangrove islands to the sea . Suddenly , a blinding spotlight blazed through the mist . The U.S. border patrol cutter Douglas C. Shute roared alongside and two agents leaped to the Harpoon 's slippery deck yelling : " Keep her on course ! " As a defiant helmsman slammed the Harpoon into a mangrove thicket , uniformed Cuban revolutionaries poured from the cabin . One tried to fire his submachine gun , failed only because the clip was in backwards ; another exploded a defective hand grenade , blowing off a finger . The rest purpled the air with curses . <P> The haul was the biggest in months-31 rebels ( who were charged with plotting against a foreign state ) , $30,000 worth of mortars , antitank guns , rifles and medical supplies headed for Fidel Castro 's revolutionary forces . Next day , in luxurious homes along Biscayne Boulevard , in such southwestern Miami hangouts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cuban faces were as long as a rum sour . And Cubans were not the only residents of Miami with a particular interest in the night 's events . The city is a hive of revolutionists ; hardly a day goes by without at least one new plot abrewing . <P> This Badge for Hire . In the past two years , gaudy , gritty Greater Miami ( 400 sq . mi. ; pop . 840,000 ) has become revolutionary headquarters of the Americas , with guns , boats , planes and men to man them all for the buying . In April Nicaraguan exiles boldly hijacked a C46 transport at Miami International Airport and flew off in an abortive assassination try against President Luis Somoza . In July a boatload of revolutionaries from Miami stormed ashore in Haiti only to be riddled by President null Duvalier 's army . The next day Dominican rebels were nabbed loading arms on another C46 in Miami , apparently with the suicidal intention of invading Dictator Rafael Trujillo 's ironclad state . And for every expedition caught , many more plotters get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The revolutionaries have chosen their GHQ well . With three airports and a mazelike coastline of winding waterways , Greater Miami is a plotter 's playground for its terrain alone . What makes it paradise are the cops , many of whom make less than $300 a month and are in the market for a little extra spending money . Rebels admit privately that the officers " give us the vista gorda " - ihe blank , unseeing eye . Nor do the police play favorites . Three Dade County deputy sheriffs junket down to Batista 's Cuba , come home bragging openly that " it did n't cost a cent ; we got the red-carpet treatment . " Marcos Prez Jimenez , former dictator of Venezuela , gains the gratitude of Miami Beach policemen by hiring them at fat fees to spend off-duty hours watching his $315,000 home .
