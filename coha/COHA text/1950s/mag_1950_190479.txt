Northwest Airlines , whose ads have sung the praises of its fleet of ten Boeing Stratocruisers , last week sued Boeing Airplane Co. for $24.7 million over the planes . The charges : Boeing had delivered the Stratocruisers 2 years late ( costing Northwest $17.2 million in traffic revenue and extra expenses ) , and the planes had so many bugs that Northwest had to spend more than $6,000,000 getting rid of them . <P> " The Stratocruiser is a wonderful plane , " Northwest 's President Croil Hunter hastened to add . " It is the greatest passenger airplane flying today . But we had to spend a lot of money making corrections which should have been done in the original design . " All told , Northwest lost so much time in maintenance , Hunter added , that " originally we could get only three hours daily use out of each airplane , compared to ten or twelve hours from a DC-4 . We have now got it up to six hours a day by making the changes ourselves . " <P> Boeing admitted that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caused by 1 ) new regulations which the Civil Aeronautics Authority ordered for all passenger planes , and 2 ) a strike which closed Boeing 's plant for 20 weeks last year . Rejoined Boeing : " We find it difficult to understand why Northwest ... is taking this . . . action . "
