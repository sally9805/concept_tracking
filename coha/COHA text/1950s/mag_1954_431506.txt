 | Mothers , even the wisest of them , are improvident creatures : they never really believe their children will grow up . It is n't that they do not plan . Their lives are feverish with planning . the paths behind them littered with discarded maps and charts and abandoned strategies . It is simply that parenthood is such a hand-to-mouth existence , such a series of skirmishes won ( or lost ) . that they can only live- like soldiers in the field . from day to day . Sufficient unto the hour is the crisis thereof . Babies must cut molars . kindergartners start oft to school- little boys break windows . and little girls their hearts at dancing class . Each peril has to be faced as it is encountered ? the first fib. the measles . the naughty word . the sprained ankle . and the explanation of sex . Puppies get run oven teachers are unjust , cronies turn out to be faithless : and every event is an emergency for which there can he no real preparation except love and common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her children are children no longer . This is a curious moment , compounded in almost equal portions of exhilaration , panic , and surprise . In the ascent of her particular Everest , she has reached a sort of plateau . and there is triumph in that . But as she peers hack at the trail by which she has come at all the little peaks surmounted and chasms crossed -- what a safe and pleasant climb it appears in retrospect ! How trivial seem those old anxieties ? the tantrums and the tonsillectomies. the disorders and the disappointments . the had grades and the poor postures and the braces on the teeth ! Even the most desperate situation had this consolation ? that however inadequate her hand . it was there to he reached for . She could interpose herself between the child and life . Now that must change . Our daughters ( for since I have only daughters . I must speak of the gender 1 know best ) must climb the rest of the way very nearly unaccompanied . and it wrings the heart . For perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still unsure of themselves . They still keep diaries . which they lock away in secret drawers . They worry about their complexions and are touchy about their friends and take a gentle suggestion as a personal affront . But they have driving licenses and a clothes allowance ; and the boys they bring home are growing up to their ears and speak condescendingly to adults in manly voices . Next year or the year after will bring college or a job . It will also bring either love or its facsimile . What then shall I , what shall  | any mother , give them for an amulet against the dangerous journey they must take alone ? For we know , unfashionable as it may be to say so , that the dangers are real . Thousands of textbooks ; editorials in the press ; papers read to learned societies ; a whole new profession of consultants on the matter , often attached to the schools ? all these , plus the conversation of the young themselves , attest their genuineness . Surely no one would be naive enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sufficient . Our daughters have known for a long time just how babies are born , and have accepted , we hope , their theoretical knowledge of sex gravely and sweetly . But the tides of spring run strong . Home ties are breaking off , and to the confusion of new voices and circumstances and the competition for popularity will be added the pulse of their own blood . Curiosity , even , will have its urgent pull . Admitted that illicit sexual adventure is a peril , at least for what used to be called " marriageable girls , " what memorable word can we teach them that they can repeat like an incantation if the tide should become a threatening flood ? I have talked this over with friends and psychologists . I have read the brochures and the textbooks . I have also thought about the problem deeply , and I know what I , for one , shall do . It 's a very iconoclastic thing ; it has not been mentioned at all in any of the dozens of pamphlets and tomes I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind my daughters simply that there is such a thing as right and such a thing as wrong . I shall commit the dreadful heresy of talking about sin .  | Now sin has always been an ugly word , but it has been made so in a new sense over the last half century . It has been made not only ugly but passe . People are no longer sinful , they are only immature or underprivileged or frightened or , more particularly , sick . And I think it has no doubt been helpful to some unfortunates to find themselves so considered . But my daughters and yours are fairly brave and certainly privileged and more mature than we might have hoped ; and if their souls had been sick , we should have known it before this . My children would believe themselves mortally insulted to have their misdemeanors classified as illnesses . In our household we have never been afraid of sin as a proper noun . In fact , although until now we have never used the word in connection with matters of sex , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is sinful to slander our neighbors . We believe that stealing and cheating and bearing false witness are sins . We think dishonest politicians are sinners . Once , when intolerance raised its unattractive head , we disposed of it readily . We refused to repeat all the windy arguments tiat have become the standard cliches ; we just said that anti-Semitism , like every other artificial bias against one 's fellow man , is a sin . And that ? as nearly as is humanly possible ? was that . Oddly enough I find little opposition to this last stand among the schoolbook coterie . If they decline to mention sin in connection with prejudice , they do consent to speak of " erroneous social thinking . " But not once , in any text , did I come across a reference to either right or wrong in regard to the great act of love . Most of the books naturally deplore sexual experiment . They use all the commonplace arguments . They point out the physical dangers , the emotional involvement , the inconveniences and distresses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of vulgarity ( one author even suggested coy things to say to " break off a petting session " ) , others have set down superbly reasoned appeals for chastity . But how strong is reason against a tidal wave ? I think conscience proves a superior shelter . My daughters shall be told that there exist a moral law and an ancient commandment and that they do wrong to flout them . AND now against my critics ( who will be many if they are well-versed in the gospel that has its ultimate evangelist in Dr. Kinsey ) I should like to argue the wholesomeness of treating extramarital relations as sinful . For that is what I do consider such teaching ? wholesome and even effective . To begin with , sin implies goodness , and the young love goodness with all their hearts . We all know what idealists they are , how fiercely they react against injustice and cruelty , how they hate hypocrisy and cant . To take away their delight in virtue , to tell them that they must withstand temptations because temptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them stones when they pant for bread . It is to weaken the muscles of their characters . In the second place , it is confusing . I think we have all argued too much with our children in this generation . It has been drummed into our ears that we must explain the reasons behind every taboo , and we in turn have drummed these reasons into their ears until they are nearly deafened . I remember my older daughter , when she was small , once listening quietly to my careful dissertation why some action was not to be tolerated . Finally she burst out , " Oh , Mother , why do n't you just tell me not to for once and stop explaining ! " Just so . It is simpler to treat sex morally than reasonably . Moreover , believing in sin is a kind of tactful armor . A girl might find , in a given situation , that it was better to tell a young man that he was doing wrong than that he was being a social dunce . His self-esteem would suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents . " When the young believe in sin , they must necessarily feel guilty if they commit it . Is not that destructive ? " From my fallible viewpoint , I do not think so . For sin implies forgiveness . One who has done a wrong can be sorry and recover . If he is generous enough . he can even forgive himself . But how does one go about forgiving oneself for a lapse in taste or a gaucherie ? We have all committed sins in our lives , meannesses and angers and lies . But most of us have forgotten them easily . What we find hard to forget or to forgive are the silly things we have said , the times we have been awkward and doltish . It is one of my articles of psychological faith that a girl ( and perhaps the same thing applies to a boy ) would find life less broken apart after a misguided love affair if she could feel that she had been sinful rather than a fool . And I hope that all our daughters are sure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy them in silence . Now all this does not mean that because I am , like Coolidge 's minister , against sin , I am also against sex or that my girls will get that impression . On the contrary , they will believe , I hope , that it is one of the moving graces of the world , far too magnificent a gift to be carelessly handled . We three women in our house are proud of being women . We feel a little sorry for men , who can never bear children or be wives . Puberty was something welcomed by my daughters with delight . So when I mention the moral standard , they will understand that it is for the sake of protecting this magnificence that mankind has slowly , strugglingly , been building for several thousand years . Fashions in morals fluctuate . Puritan rigor gives way to Restoration license , and that in turn is drowned in Victorian severity . It is possible that much of our own permissive nonsense will be frowned on by the generation now growing up . But right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences . And of this my daughters must be aware . So what in the end shall I tell my daughters about chastity before marriage ? Of course , I shall be sensible and I point out the ordinary social penalties attached to any other conduct . I shall touch on the possible pregnancy , the untidiness , and the heartbreak . But I shall also say that love is never merely a biological act but one of the few miracles left on earth , and that to use it cheaply is a sin . In fact that is what I have already told them .
