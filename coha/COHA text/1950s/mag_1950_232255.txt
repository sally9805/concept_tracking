When 20-year-old Alice Morrison unpacked her Saratoga trunk in her tiny room at the Vineland ( N.J. ) Training School in 1900 , she had a sinking sensation . The silent , halting students she had just seen were far different from the kind she had been taught to cope with at the New Hampton ( N.H. ) Literary and Biblical Institution . <P> In 1900 , when Alice Morrison came to Vineland , it was one of three pioneer institutions for the mentally deficient , * had been going just twelve years . The rest of the U.S. knew precious little about retarded children ( i.e. , those with an intelligence fixed below the twelve-year level ) or what could be done for them . Horrified and grief-stricken parents hid the unhappy children in back rooms or sent them to be cared for in inadequately equipped asylums . <P> A Stammered Grace . When Alice Morrison arrived , the school owned six buildings and had 200 students . She spent a long day looking around her and sizing up her job . As she surveyed the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one youngster repeat a stammered grace , she made up her mind to stay . <P> She stayed . She married one of the school officials , Charles Emerson Nash , set up housekeeping in the administration building . To many of the children whose parents never visited them , the Nashes became " Mother " and " Pop . " <P> As director of studies , Alice Nash was continually exploring new possibilities for her limited boys &; girls : music , dramatics , dancing and a variety of handicrafts as well as slow-motion versions of the three Rs . Vineland became known as one of the foremost schools for mental deficients in the U.S. <P> Places in the World . Most of her victories were small ones : teaching a mongoloid boy ( with a three-year-old 's intelligence ) to plow a straight furrow ; coaxing a few words from a six-year-old who had never spoken ; teaching a girl to sew a straight hem or weave a towel . But she also fought for places in the outside world for students she felt were ready , every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During World War II she had the satisfaction of seeing a hundred of her " boys " accepted for service . <P> Last week , as Alice Nash completed her 50th year there , Vineland 's 93 buildings spread over a broad , 1,100-acre campus . A hundred Vineland boys ran a 400-acre farm which helped feed the school 's 550 students . The school had already fostered five other New Jersey institutions for the mentally retarded , served as the model for such schools as far away as Australia . The next step was a $1,000,000 fund-raising drive to build a new research center and expand the school 's facilities . <P> As the drive got under way , 70-year-old Alice Morrison Nash sat in the crowded ballroom of Manhattan 's Statler Hotel one night last week and listened to tributes from Nobel Prizewinner Pearl Buck , Stateswoman Ruth Bryan Rohde and New Jersey Governor Alfred E. Driscoll . She nodded happily at the applause of friends , former students and parents who had gathered to honor her , then prepared to return to her boys &; girls at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State School in Waverley , Mass. , established in 1848 ; and the Elwyn ( Pa . ) Training School , established in 1852.
