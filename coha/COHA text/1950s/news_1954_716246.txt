txt Dow does Senator Joseph R. McCarthy ( R ) of Wisconsin get secret papers of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ? A new mystery has been added to the McCarthy-Army controversy . The tense caucus room saw a curious new spectacle : Senators , counsel , and Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens refusing to read a document marked " secret and confidential " and " security " which Senator McCarthy proudly proclaimed that he had read , and which he sought vainly to have put into the official files . Senator McCarthy announced in passing that he would not be bound by the presidential directive of former President Truman ? which President Eisenhower has continued ? forbidding the dissemination of " security " information . The senator caused a sensa- tion in the hearings when he offered a memorandum which purportedly was a letter from J. Edgar Hoover , FBI director , dated Jan. 25 , 1951 , addressed to Maj. Gen. Alexander R. Bolling , then chief of Army Intelligence , alleged to be a warning of security risks at Fort Monmouth ( N.J. ) radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be bound by the presidential security directive . President Eisenhower was identifying himself more strongly than he has previously with Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens , Senator McCarthy 's principal antagonist . Mr. Eisenhower disclosed to his press conference that he has talked several times with Mr. Stevens since ? the congressional hearings started . The President said that he hoped the United States may derive benefits from the hearings to offset what has been lost in the way of international prestige and national respect . ? Fullest ' Backing And he concluded by declaring Mr. Stevens was selected as Army secretary with great care , that he knows of nothing in his performance of duties that would cause him ( President Eisenhower ) to lose any confidence in Mr. Stevens  --  and that he will back him to the fullest limit . In view of Senator McCarthy 's charges of " falsehood " against Mr. Stevens , this looked like open warfare between the White House and the Wisconsin senator . Senator McCarthy 's relations to the FBI have caused Washington speculation . Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to FBI questioners because he believes it may become public . Recently Senator Everett M. Dirksen ( R ) of Illinois , a member of the Senate investigations subcommittee told a radio panel that senators ' patience were taxed when witnesses dented Communist associations at a time when the subcommittee had " FBI files " at its elbow to substantiate charges . Now Senator McCarthy offers the Mundt group a classified FBI report allegedly in the form of a letter between Mr. Hoover and Maj. Gen. H. R. Bolling . The senator refuses to say how he got it . Branded a Crime Army special counsel Joseph N. Welch argued it is a " crime " to possess such a document . Responding to comments by Senator Henry M. Jackson ( D ) of Washington . Senator McCarthy declared that he had " higher standards " than Senator Jackson . He said the ban on " classified " documents was a " Truman directive . " " No directive will preclude me from examining material that affects the security of the nation , " Senator McCarthy commented . " There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to covering up Communists . " Word meanwhile came to the Mundt committee from Mr. Hoover denying that there was an exact original of the manuscript of which the 2 ? 4-page McCarthy document was supposed to represent a copy . On that sonic day  --  Jan. 20 , 1951  --  the FBI sent out a 15-page interdepartmental memorandum , one copy of which apparently went to General Bolling , while another copy went to Maj. Gen. Joseph Carroll of the Air Force . Leak ' Suspected Mr. Hoover denied having made this memorandum public . The inference was , accordingly , that somebody had " leaked " the substance from the Hoover office , or the breach had occurred in the Army or the Air Force . Secretary Stevens ? on the witness stand for the 10th ? day in televised hearings  --  testified that an overnight search of Army files failed to produce the original of the purported letter .

Chairman Karl E. Mundt ( R ) of South Dakota made some effort to prevent Senator McCarthy from divulging the maferial in the alleged " letter , " but the Wisconsin senator evaded his restrictions without much difficulty . Robert C. Collier , assistant special counsel to the subcommittee , who had been delegated to interrogate Mr. Hoover , took the witness stand . The 15-page interdepartmental memorandum , Mr. Hoover was quoted as declaring , was " materially different in form " from the purported Hoover-Bolling " letter . " Not a carbon Copy " I can now report to you that this is not a carbon copy or a copy prepared for or sent to General Bolling on this or any other date , " Mr. Collier testified . Mr. Collier explained carefully that he had not read either the 15-page memorandum or the 2/,4-page version from Senator McCarthy on the ground of possible security violation . Mr. Collier agreed , however , that , from what Mr. Hoover said , the McCarthy " surprise " letter appeared to be a " summary " of the 15-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
