Most of the Arctic Ocean is covered with spongy , saltwater ice only about ten feet thick-too thin to support anything more weighty than a family of iglooed Eskimos . Last week the Air Force reported that many hundred miles from land , aircraft crews of its weather service on polar flights had discovered ice islands with more important possibilities . Pictures of one of them were shown to an Alaskan Science Conference at Washington . The ice island is some 35 miles long and 18 miles wide ; some parts rise 90 ft. above the frozen ocean . If it is really floating , its ice is about 350 ft. thick . The surface is covered with low parallel ridges 500 ft. wide and looks rather like a gigantic ploughed field . The island may drift a mile or so a day , probably in circles . <P> How the ice islands originated was a puzzle to the experts , but they were more interested in their possible uses . The islands may be smooth enough in places for airplanes to land upon . If not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulldozers parachuted from aircraft . An airfield near the pole would be useful as a weather station , an emergency landing field , a site for radar or a center for air rescues in the remote Arctic . In the back of military minds was the possibility of making the islands into advanced bomber bases . <P> So far as the public knows , no one has yet landed on any of the ice islands . Even their ownership is not settled . The U.S. maintains that land ( even floating " land , " presumably ) belongs to the nation that discovers and occupies it first . But for polar regions the U.S.S.R. supports the " sector principle " : that everything north of its territory is its property . At least one of the ice islands lies well beyond the pole in the Soviet-claimed " sector . "
