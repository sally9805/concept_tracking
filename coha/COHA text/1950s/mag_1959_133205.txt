CINCINNATI is apparently headed for its third championship in three years of conference membership . The addition of a 6-foot-9 , 240-pound sophomore named Paul Hogue brings rebounding power to a roster already overflowing with offensive ability , and even Coach George Smith is obliged to concede that " we should be better this year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national scoring crown , plus Ralph Davis at guard with his 15.5 average . He also welcomes the return of Forward Bob Wiesenhahn to the starting five , which is completed by the promotion of Carl Bouldin . A 6-foot-8 junior center , Mel Landfried , adds depth and experience , as does 6-foot-6 Forward Larry Willey . Two sophomores , 6-foot-6 Forward Sandy Pomerantz and Guard Jim Calhoun , will play often , BRADLEY 'S NIT runners-up are the team to deny Cincy if anyone can . Despite the impending midyear graduation of all-conference Guard Bobby Joe Mason and the knee injury of high-scoring Guard Mike Owens , Coach Chuck Orsborn is optimistic because of " the best prospect Bradley has ever had , " 6-foot-6 sophomore Chester Walker . If Owens ' knee weakens , veteran Al Saunders will move from forward to guard , and when Mason graduates his spot will be filled by an aggressive freshman who moves up with the midyear class , 6-foot-5 Mack Herndon . Starter Dan Smith is sure to be at forward again . Ed Wodka and Lee Edwards bolster the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiemann back up the already solid guard positions , ST . LOUIS has lost Center Bob Ferry , who was the only senior on the all-conference team , but four other Billiken starters are back . A 6-foot-10 , 270-pound junior , Bob Nordmann , will move into Ferry 's post position as the heart of a front line that includes veterans George Burkel ( 6 feet 7 ) and 6-foot-5 Pete McCaffrey , one of the very best in this circuit . Starting guards will again be Jim Dailey and Glen Mankowski , giving Coach John Bennington a big , experienced first five , though one that is shy of speed . Reserves are Tom Smith , Art Hambric , Dick Sanders and Tom Kieffer at guard , and Gordon Hartweger at forward , WICHITA is also loaded . All the starters return , but a pair of big sophomores may force some of them to the bench . Al Tate is all-star caliber at forward , pairing with Ron Heller or John Gales . Elbert Urban , 6 feet 8 , will be helped at center by 6-foot-9 sophomore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks promising at forward . Starting Guards Lanny Van Eman and Virgil Brady , both juniors , should stay ahead of lettermen Phil Hayden and Dick Casidy . Tom Mallot and Bob Glascock bolster the lanky forwards . HOUSTON 'S brilliant Gary Phillips was the conference 's best sophomore and Ted Luckenbill the runner-up last year . Center Bill Hathaway , 6 feet 11 , and Forward Pete Markle also return to a starting lineup that averages 6 feet 5 . The chances of rising into the conference 's first division are brightened most by a strong bench . Guards Bryan Schisler and Jim Lemmon , Forward Dick Molchany and 6-foot-10 Carl Raleigh are joined by high-scoring sophomores Dan Palombizio and Tom Thomson . At DRAKE Coach Maurice John must juggle three veteran starters , three sophomores and five transfer students . Jim Guydon will drive the pattern offense from the backcourt , while Dave Terre , 6 feet 11 , and Roger Prescott provide experience up front . Tallest of the transfers are sophomores Bruce Bremner , 6 feet 6 , and Bob Mueller , 6 feet 5 , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee Mc-Knight are also back on the school 's tallest-ever team , NORTH TEXAS STATE has five starters back , including an outstanding center in 6-foot-7 Jim Mudd . Tom Grissom , Bill McLaughlin , Darrell Reitzel and Rod Byrd will also start but new Coach Chuck Johnson still needs height and a capable bench , TULSA 'S Coach Clarence Iba has lost his top two scorers and lacks reserve strength . He 'll have to rely on better defense to compensate for reduced scoring ability . A tall first five is paced by Bobby Good-all , Gene Estes and Dave Voss , with Jim Weaver and Ray Gross up from the reserves . Sophs Floyd Huffines , Bill Lucas and Don Morris are the better newcomers .
