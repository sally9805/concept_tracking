Before he ever became a college president , Dwight D. Eisenhower made up his mind about one thing the U.S. needed : a system for getting the best of the nation 's brains-scholars and men of affairs-regularly around a conference table to thresh their way to agreement on the nation 's most pressing public questions . Last week Eisenhower announced that he was ready to begin . He called his project " The American Assembly . " He also called it " the most important step I have taken as president of Columbia University . " <P> Eisenhower 's idea is to set up a series of three-to-five-day conferences to take place eight times a year . For each meeting , he will invite some 30 to 40 notables from business , labor , the professions , politics and government to discuss such questions as taxation , the size of the armed forces , federal aid to education , what to do about Tito , what to do about Formosa . Before his guests arrive , an " intellectual task force " of scholars will chum out background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems , their conclusions will be published for the rest of the U.S. to chew on . <P> Eisenhower hopes to get his assembly started by April ( before that , he must raise $500,000 to cover expenses ) . Eventually , he hopes , other universities will start assemblies of their own . " We are , " says he , " troubled with vague uncertainties , without really knowing what our problems and our worries are really about . " Would such assemblies be able to say ? Says Eisenhower : " We will try . "
