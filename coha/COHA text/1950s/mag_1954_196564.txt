For more than four months , Dwight Eisenhower and his team labored over the State of the Union message . The job began last September , when the President sent out a call to heads of 20 major departments and agencies of the Federal Government . From the mountain of data that poured in , the White House staff distilled a 15,000-word rough draft . Then , line by line , President Eisenhower knifed through it with his sharp yellow pencil , suggesting , rewriting , calling for more new facts . The process went on at the White House , then in the little office in Georgia above the pro shop at the Augusta National Golf Club . In all , the message went through more than 20 formal drafts . Last week , only four hours after the last careful change had been sent through , President Eisenhower , message in hand , strode briskly into the House of Representatives . <P> It was a message of tremendous scope , ranging the whole field of the Federal Government 's problems and responsibilities from the atom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on more than 30 points and promising at least eight more detailed messages . It was a message that proudly enumerated substantial accomplishments and confidently outlined aims for the future . <P> The past year , said the President , brought " much for which we may be thankful . First of all , we are deeply grateful that our sons no longer die on the distant mountains of Korea . . . The nation has just completed the most prosperous year in its history . The damaging effect of inflation ... has been brought under control . The cost of our Government has been reduced , and its work proceeds with some 183,000 fewer employees ; thus the discouraging trend of modern governments toward their own limitless expansion has been in our case reversed . The cost of armaments becomes less oppressive as we near our defense goals ; yet we are militarily stronger every day . " <P> The President discussed strategy with a frankness and cogency never before equaled in a State of the Union message . " Communist aggression , halted in Korea , continues to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , assisted by timely aid from our country . In West Germany , in Iran and in other areas of the world , heartening political victories have been won by the forces of stability and freedom . Slowly but surely , the free world gathers strength . <P> " Meanwhile , from behind the Iron Curtain , there are signs that tyranny is in trouble and reminders that its structure is as brittle as its surface is hard . There has been , in fact , a great strategic change in the world during the past year . That precious intangible , the initiative , is becoming ours . Our policy , not limited to mere reaction against crises provoked by others , is free to develop along lines of our choice . . . " <P> Carefully departmentalizing his subjects , the President discussed the status of the U.S. and his recommendations field by field , point by point :
