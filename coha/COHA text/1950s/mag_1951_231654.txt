To the bishop it was the shock of a lifetime . The rector of one of his best churches had complained that his job was " too soft , " had asked for transfer to " the toughest nut you 've got . " <P> Episcopal Bishop Noel Porter of Sacramento surveyed his Northern California diocese , at length sent the Rev. Robert Ray Read to two struggling missions in rugged , mountainous , sparsely populated Siskiyou County : Dunsmuir ( pop . 2,500 ) , a lusty railroad division point , and Mc-Cloud ( pop . 1,900 ) , a lumber town 16 miles away . Arriving at Dunsmuir in May 1948 , Read " felt like a throwback to the 1 8th Century , when ministers really had to work , instead of keeping office hours . " He had to work to stay alive : he got only $600 from the two missions , plus a $600 travel allowance from the diocese . He also had to build up his congregations ; the average Sunday attendance at Dunsmuir was nine , at McCloud only six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do both . A ruddy , greying bachelor of 52 with a linesman 's build ( 6 ft. 1 in. ; 200 Ibs. ) , he became night clerk at a Dunsmuir hotel , worked seven nights a week at $49 a week . Says he : " I met numbers of people whom I would never have known otherwise . " Through these and other contacts , he multiplied his congregations to the point where he needed his evenings for meetings and parish visits . He moved to McCloud , got a lumbermill job , joined the local C.I.O. union . As a ripsaw tailoff , he stands at the end of a screaming saw and deftly lifts some 30,000 molding strips a day into waiting trucks . In 1950 the mill paid him $3,130 , nearly double what he got from the church . But in one way or another , he works at being a pastor all the time . <P> Pastor Read lives austerely in his one small room that is almost bare of personal possessions . It does have a piece of clothesline and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends it on birthday presents for moppets , fishing trips for underprivileged boys , books and ice cream for the sick . Most of his charity is secret . Last week John Glaese , principal of Dunsmuir High School , who recently became an Episcopalian " because I admired this wonderful minister so much , " said : " Nobody will ever know how much Mr. Read does for people , helping sick bodies as well as souls . He works in a conspiracy of silence . He wo n't tell what he 's done . " <P> Example to Follow . Today there are 30 communicants at McCloud , and Dunsmuir has a combined church and Sundayschool membership of 100 . Each Sunday Pastor Read holds a g a.m. service in the white-painted , frame St. John 's Church McCloud , gives a ten-minute , one-point sermon . Then he hops into his secondhand Chevrolet , drives over a mountain road to Dunsmuir and conducts 11 o'clock services . <P> In 1950 both missions paid their diocesan assessments in full , Dunsmuir for the first time in 15 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Bishop Porter makes his next visit to the two missions , 25 adults and children will be ready for confirmation .
