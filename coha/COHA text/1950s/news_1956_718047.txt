txt Experts on Soviet affairs an inclined to agree that Nikita S. Khrushchev 's anti-Stalin crusade has got out of hand . Indeed , some of them feel that Mr. Khrushchev has gone so far in loosening the reins on the Communist parties outside the Soviet Union that he will either have to reverse himself or follow Stalin into the discard . This is not the unanimous opinion of the men here whose job it is to read the Soviet riddle . Some of them ' think the criticism of Moscow by the Communists in Rome , Paris , London and . New York was planned that way . Those who favor this interpretation see the rash of antiKhrushchev statements among non-Soviet Communists as part of Moscow 's plan to dramatize the new Soviet line of independence for all national Communist parties . This is not the general view of the experts here , however . The majority of them feel that the Communist criticism of Mr. Khrushchev has gone beyond anything Moscow expected and will have to be handled with great skill if the Communist alliance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes without saying Gnat all this is sheer speculation . Nobody knows better than the men who have studied tie Soviet - Union all their lives ' how- little they really know about the inner workings of the Communist sorcery . Yet nothing that has happened in . the Soviet world since the Khrushchev tirade against Stalin has intrigued officials here more than the outspoken demands by the Communist party leaders outside the Soviet Union fox an explanation of what Khrushchev and company were doing while Stalin perpetrated the crimes reported to the Twentieth Communist Party Congress . Palmiro Togliatti , Communist leader in Italy , was the first to demand " a Marxist explanation " of " how such errors could have crept into the evolution of socialistic society . " This same line was taken up by Maurice Thorez , Communist // leader in France , but with this difference : While condemning Stalin and indirectly Mr. Khrushchev , the French line has continued seeking opportunities to praise Stalin 's " achievements . " To most of the experts here this does not look like a carefully arranged , systematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence of the national Communist parties . It is true that all the outside Communist leaders have criticized the way Mr. Khrushchev 's speech was leaked first to the capitalist press in the West , and that some of them seemed to be concentrating their fire on Mr. Khrushchev in a way to deflect criticism from the Communist " system . " But at the same time the system is being criticized and Mr. Khrushchev is being put definitely on the spot . Mr. Khrushchev was able to ignorz the publication ( ) this speech in the West , and even the sharp Criticism of Western leaders , particularly Secretary of State Dulles . But the feeling here is thatt he can not very well ignore tile waspish comments of Signor Togliatti , M. Thorez , Pietro Nenni , Italian Left-wing Socialist leader ' , and the others . These men carried out Stalin 's business for many years . By criticizing Mr. Khrushchev and asking " Where were you during all these Stalinist crimes ? " they raise the same questions about themselves . This point has not been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Signor Togliatti and M. Thorez were themselves beneficiaries in their own countries of the " cult of personality " that they now criticize in relation to Stalin . The Italian and French Communists are demanding that there should be less of this , more freedom of discussion and more " collective leadership " in ? the future of the Italian and French Communist parties . The main question being asked by the experts here is what the effect of all this will be , first , on the Communist movements all over the world , and second , on the future of Mr. Khrushchev and Soviet Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin and all the others closely identified with Stalin in the era of the officially confessed crimes . One view here is that the Communists may very well . succeed in making themselves more acceptable as political partners in their . own countries by loosening their ties with Moscow . But by concentrating on the sins of Stalin they inevitably encourage criticism of themselves as partners in Stalin 's barbarism Younger Leaders Discussed Some of the best informed of the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , either a reversal of the anti-Stalinist line or a weakening of the leadership of those who were closely identified with Stalin and his terror . For the first time there was some talk here today about the Khrushchev-Bulganin team as a transitional regime pending the rise of new leaders in the Soviet Union who were not of Stalin 's generation and not part of the inner circle that tolerated his policies . Younger men in the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist party , such as Maxim Z. Saburov , chairman of the Planning Committee of that organ and Mikhail G. Pervukhin , a First Deputy Premier , were being mentioned , for example . Also there was considerable talk . about the possible rise of Marshal Georgi K. Zhukov , Defense . Minister , who was a friend of General Eisenhower when they were commanders in Berlin . Some here feel that , in the next phase , the Soviet military leaders , who were so roundly criticized by Stalin , may emerge as the men to carry out the new line and that , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well lead to the emergence of new Communist lea.00:211 ; to replace Signor Togliatti , M. Thorez and the others in the West . French Reds Approach Tito Special to The New York Times . BUCHAREST , Rumania , June 26 ? French Communist leaders have asked for an invitation from President Tito of Yugoslavia to visit him in Belgrade , according to reports here . It is not certain , however , whether the Yugoslays are yet ready to receive them . Because of his heavy schedule in the Soviet Union and during his visit in Rumania , Marshal Tito has not seen the latest resolution of the French Communist party criticizing the Soviet leadership . He said he had not heard of the French Communists ' request , but would look into it on his arrival in Belgrade tomorrow . It was clear that Yugoslav of-1 ficials were not impressed with ' the previous French Communist statement . When Marshal Tito visited Paris last month he turned down requests for interviews from the French Communist leaders Maurice Thorez and Jacques Duclos , it was disclosed here . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent statements of the Italian Communist leader , Palmiro Togliatti , who expressed sharp discontent with Moscow . Asked tonight what he thought of Signor Togliatti 's latest speech , Marshal Tito nodded and said : " Very good . It was a very good speech . " The Yugoslays do not consider that the attacks on the Soviet leadership weaken the position of Nikita S. Khrushchev . On the contrary , their view is that Mr. Khrushchev and Marshal Bulganin are faced with continued resistance to their new policies from loyal Stalinist elements in the middle ranks of the Soviet Communist Party . Belgians Confess Laxity Special to The New York Times . BRUSSELS , June ** Belgian Communist party admitted today it had failed to pay enough attention to the possibility of excesses in the Soviet Union during Stalin 's regime . The confession was printed in Le Drapeau Rouge , organ of the Belgian Communist party . It was part of a resolution adopted Sunday at a meeting of the party 's Central Committee . This condemned as " inadmissible the violations of the way of life established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialism . "
