Ramon Magsaysay , the forthright , freewheeling young ( 47 ) President of the Philippines , is one of the staunchest friends the U.S. has in Asia . His vast popularity in the country and the immense Philippine good will towards the U.S. is often not reflected in Congress , where shrewd politicians in Magsaysay 's own Nacionalista Party often succeed in putting a brake on him . Chief among them is Senator Claro Recto , 65 , a brilliant , caustic lawyer who has never forgotten or forgiven the U.S. for his being put in prison at World War II 's end by Douglas Mac-Arthur ( Recto served as Foreign Minister under the Japanese occupation ) . <P> Last month President Magsaysay , encouraged by the U.S. decision to give treaty protection to Formosa and the Pescadores , strongly backed the U.S. " policy of firmness " and introduced in the Philippine Congress a resolution stating that " we stand squarely behind the U.S. " Angry Claro Recto , an influential member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee , introduced a quibbling substitute motion , leaving out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recto 's neutralist way of thinking . For four weeks the Senate bitterly debated the matter . When it came to a vote last week , Neutralist Recto was utterly beaten . Of 22 sitting Senators , all but one voted with Magsaysay . The one : Claro Recto.
