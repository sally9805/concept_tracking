For more than a quarter-century , U.S. radio stations have signed on &; off the air with such tiresome technical details ( station 's frequency , place of business , etc. ) as are required by federal law . This week , Manhattan 's station WNBC decided to spice up the formalities with " wakeup copy " in the morning and " go-to-bed copy " at night . To do the job , enterprising General Manager Ted Cott commissioned such seasoned phrasemakers as Poet Louis Untermeyer , Novelist Fannie Hurst , Editor Norman ( Saturday Review of Literature ) Cousins and topflight Radio <P> Scripters Norman Corwin and Arch Oboler . Samples : <P> Poet Untermeyer hailing the dawn : " . . . Morning , which has never failed , has come again . The city rubs its eyes and wakes from sleep ... In the country , the birds have already roused the world . The barn doors swing wide ; the milkers put down their pails ; the good earth breathes deeply . . . These next hours are precious ; they may be milestones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all your resources . They are yours . Take this day . Make it a day to remember-or just to enjoy . Make it a good day . And , to begin with , a good Good Morning . " <P> Novelist Fannie Hurst at day 's end : " . . . Here I am , about finished , and ready to slip into yesterday 's seven thousand years of days ... I am the day on which you paid off the mortgage . . . signed an international treaty or had your tonsils out . Somewhere in my hours , I contained murder , flood , epidemic . You have used and abused me in billions of ways ... In another moment I will have become Yesterday ! And so , along with your bag &; baggage , your frailties and your grandeurs , I deliver you affectionately to Tomorrow . Hail &; Farewell . "
