Like a fraternity pledge on initiation day , President Arthur M. Loew of Loew 's Inc . ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) marched warily into his first annual meeting last week after barely two months in the job . He found his stockholders in no mood to spare the paddles .

" As usual , Management Baiter Lewis Gilbert , owner of 20 shares ( value : $447.50 ) , had plenty to say .

I resent the insinuation . " Furthermore , said Loew , " I bought 1,000 shares last week just to keep you happy .
