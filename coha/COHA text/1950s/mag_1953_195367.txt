In an essay on the proposition " That the Hour of Truce-Making Is Dangerous , " Michel de Montaigne recalled : " The Spartan King Cleomones made a seven-day truce with the people of Argos , then attacked them on the third night while they were asleep and expecting no harm ; the excuse he gave was that the seven-day truce made no mention of nights . " <P> Every day last week brought new conciliatory words and deeds from the Communist camp ( see INTERNATIONAL ) . The U.S. , long braced against insult and aggression from that quarter , was perplexed , a little scared , and in some danger of losing its balance because of the unexpected yielding of its adversary . The U.S. had to face the probability that the new Communist attitude was more than a flurry , that it might be continued for months or years . What did the Communist moves mean ? How should the U.S. meet them ? <P> At first , the most common U.S. reaction was skepticism . Asked what they thought of the Communist overtures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another trap , " or " I would n't trust those rats , " or " They 're trying to fool us again . " Said Republican Senator Bourke Hickenlooper : " I do n't see any sincerity in it ... They have a completely ulterior purpose . " <P> Optimism cropped out here &; there , too . Said North Dakota 's Senator William Langer : " I believe the Russians are sincere , and I do n't think they 're trying to divide us from our allies at all . " <P> Hot Diplomacy . Neither 100% skepticism nor wide-eyed optimism will be adequate to guide U.S. policy now that hot diplomacy has been added to cold war . It would be folly to accept the sincerity of Communist long-range peaceful intentions as stated by Malenkov in his oration at Stalin 's funeral . It might be equally disastrous for the U.S. to turn its back on all new arrangements with the Communists on the ground that Communist aims can not be trusted . It is true that the Communists intend all deals to work to their advantage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal it is to their advantage to break . Despite this , the U.S. can make many deals that will work to its advantage-and it can do so without trusting Communists . <P> The Communist moves are not peaceful in intent , but the U.S. aim must be to handle them so that the result works for peace-by what President Eisenhower calls " self-enforcing treaties . " The Reds may not mean what they say , but the U.S. , if it plays its cards right , can make them act as if they did . Nobody runs out on a deal when he will clearly lose more by breaking his word than by keeping it . <P> The Communists may agree on and faithfully carry out an exchange of wounded prisoners in Korea , and from there go on to an exchange of other prisoners . They can then agree to a Korean truce . A truce will be good or bad for the U.S. , depending on its terms , on U.S. ability to enforce them , and on other countermoves which the U.S. and the Communists make in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
