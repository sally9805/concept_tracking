txt French colonialists , who have fought a Vietnamese Indo-China independence movement here since December , 1946 , have a new propaganda line for visitors to this hot , fruitful land which they have controled since 1857 and are determined not to lose Foreigners are told : " You must realize that Viet Nam is now an international problem . Communist China is just across our northern border . If we French leave here , the country will go Red tomorrow ? with China 's help which already is being given . Then all southeast Asia will follow . " Therefore anti - Communists , and specifically you Americans , must give us great help in our fight against the communist Ho Chi Minh and his Viet Minh Vietnamese Front guerillas . You must give us great help because our problem is your problem now . You oppose the Communists and so do we . " Argument Is Widespread This argument is heard in the sidewalk cafes of Hanoi and in the smart : ; hops along the Rue Catinat in Saigon , which the French like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally the same line of reasoning is laid on even more thickly in conversations with French civil servants . or with officials of the government of Bao D a i , the French sponsored puppet chief of state who used to be emperor of Annam and still prefers to be addressed as " your majesty . " It is , of course . Bao Dai 's line as well , as he made clear in response to questions submitted by this reporter . How the 26,000,000 people of Viet Nam , and the twin western kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia , feel about Bao Dai is harder to learn for they dare not express an anti-Bae Dai or anti-French attitude unless they can trust their questioner not to expose them . . Confidence Begets Frankness Fortunately , this reporter was able to talk with a group of Vietnamese nationalists in Hanoi . who spoke frankly because they had faith in the European who brought me to them . They obviously were people of substance and intellect and they were not Communists . Two of them were educated in French universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for their own protection their names not be used . And this , briefly summarized , is what they had to say : " You can put us down as - both anti-French and anti-Communist . We are pro-Viet Nam . Our countrymen have the same right to Ifreedom that you Americans ex ' ercised when you no longer could stand British domination . " We were greatly heartened when the Indians followed your ex ample and the Indonesians forced the Dutch to leave their country . Deplore Burmese Turmoil " We are glad that Burma is free but sorry that so many internal troubles beset the Burmese . Our neighbors itt'Siam never have been under European domination and we envy them . As for Malaya , the British are intruders there as the French are here . " You have been told that if the French are forced out of Viet Nam , our country will come under the control of Communists and move within the htfluence of China . We doubt this , for people who tell you that fail to say that we Vietnamese have no ties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even If what the French say happened to be true , it is our right to govern ourselves . We know ' that Ho Chi Minh studied at the revolutionary academy in Moscow and thus can be technically called a Communist : we also know that he has done more for Vietnamese freedom and hide- , pendence than any of our people . Backers Not Communists " We know further that the great majority of those who fight for or otherwise support Ho Chi Minh , including ourselves , are not Communists , and , it the time came , we would fight communist domination as hard as we . fight French domination . " You Americans are doing the Vietnamese people a great disservice by recognizing and aiding the government of Bao Cal , who is only a French puppet . You thus are strengthening the rule , or attempted rule , of a Vietnamese traitor  --  you and the British . " The nationalists poured vermouth and soda for their guests and continued their earnest argument . " We can tell you , " their spokesman said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders given them by Ho Chi Minh 's Viet Minh government , and only 5 per cent of the orders which reach them from Bao Dai 's French puppet government . Return Home on Orders " Much is made by the French and the Bao Dal people of the fact that villagers are returning to their homes in French controled territory . It is said that they are deserting Ho . Actually , they are returning because Ho 's commanders have told them to do so . And why ? Because this increases the French problem of feeding them , and that is clever harassment . Meanwhile the returning populace helps the Viet Minh with supplies , stealthily de- ' livered by night . " You are told that Ho is hand in glove with the Communists . Perhaps so , but it is notable that his government has not promulgated a single communist measure since it took the leadership in the resistance movement . There has been no suggestion that private capital be touched or lands shared among all . The French propagandists are clever but they rarely stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refute this straight talk .
