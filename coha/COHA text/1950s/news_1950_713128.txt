txt Bernard M. Baruch called today for Lmmediate all-out national mobilization that would include blanket price , wage and rent controls as well as rationing . The Administration 's proposals for production incentives , priorities and allocations and consumercredit restrictions , he said , were excellent . But he declared the program did not go far enough . Unless it were expanded as he recommended , he declared , the program would become an " invitation to inflation . " Testifying before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee on the Administration bill , the " elder statesman , " now approaching his eighty - first birthday , warned that the legislation , as presented , would defeat itself . " This bill proposes , " he said , " a system of priorities over production , yet nowhere is provision made for controlling prices and other costs . Should this bill be enacted ? without price control  --  the Government may get - , rhat it wants , but with needless delay and everincreasing prices . " The public will be left to compete for the remainder  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding who gets what is available . The cost of every defense item will be needlessly increased ; profiteering encouraged ; cruel injustice inflicted upon millions with fixed incomes or who have no pressure group to represent them . " Other Recommendations Made In other companion proposals , Mr , Baruch recommended : That taxes be set high enough to cover all defense costs and reduce profiteering . That an over-all mobilizing agency be created immediately , to synchronize the implementation of planning by , the National Security Resources Board . That a capital issues committee be established under the Secretary of the Treasury to review all capital issues , public and private , deferring less essential projects to make sure housing , schools , hospitals and other more essential needs are met first . That the role of the United Nations be strengthened by coordinating our efforts with it in common defense of peace . That assistance in rearming nations ready to resist aggression be speeded along with expansion of our own defenses . But Mr. Baruch , while he spoke strongly for his other points , hammered away both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the need for full price controls and rationing . He declared he would be loath to increase government  --  controls if the exigencies of , the world situation did net demand it . ? ecognizing that ' there was a fear of concentrating too much power in government , he declared that the " gravest ' threats to the preservation of the American system today are not government controls . " " They are military defeat abroad and further inflation at home , " he said . " Each day that prices rise , the real value of every dollar appropriated by Congress shrinks . More billions will have to be voted to buy the same things ; the national debt will mount needlessly . " A stand-by price control law , if it had been on the books before the Korean situation started , might have stopped price rises , Mr. Baruch said . But that hope , he added , was now dashed . Heavy taxation , even an excess profits tax which he favored would not be enough to prevent profiteering and inflation , he asserted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness who sought to pass on the lessons he learned in two other global conflicts , obviously . were ' impressed . Some frankly said they were inclined to go along with the program . But an almost universal question was : How do we sell controls and rationing to the public ? Critical of Government Mr. Baruch replied that Congress was behind the people on , this issue and , in answer to a question , declared that the Adminis- , tration was lagging , too . At a number of points , the witness was critical of the Administration . " This legislation before you , " he said on one occasion , " proposes , that we ' deliberately refuse to lock the stable door until the horse is stolen . " Mindful of the split between President Truman and Mr. Baruch that occurred during the 1948 Presidential campaign , a reporter asked the witness if he had talked with the Chief Executive since the Korean fighting began . " No , " said Mr. Baruch . " Do you plan to see him on your proposals ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the reply delivered in an emphatic tone . The Baruch testimony was received by the Senate committee ea it drove to complete hearings tomorrow night in order that it might start rewriting the bill on Friday . The House Banking and Currency Committee , which has been holding simultaneous hearings on the same bill , finished this phase of its work today as it heard General . Omar N. Bradley , Chairman of , the Joint Chiefs of Staff , in executive session . House Group Shapes Bill Today round of puppet aggressions ? where next who can tell ? " The witness declared that the essence of this nation 's foreign policy " must be to pace ourselves vis-a-vis the Soviets . " Even if the Korean situation should blow over , he warned , the country would still have to mobilize " or invite aggression elsewhere . " In response to questions , he emphasized that , by " pacing " Russia , he did not mean " gun for gun or tank for tank . " He declared , however , that this country must be strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends around the world from " getting on the neutrality fence . " Like a number of the Senators who heard him , Mr. Baruch deplored the fact that the President 's interim tax message asked for only $5,000,000,000 more in taxes , rather than the full $10,000,000,000 that the first start toward mobilization would cost . The witness favored making tax increases apply , at least , to the last half of 1950 earnings . After reading his formal statement , Mr. Baruch , unable to hear Senators ' questions even with his hearing aid in the big Senate caucus room , left the witness stand'to Replies to Douglas Question When Senator . Paul H. Douglas , 1 Democrat of Illinois , asked when the witness would have price controls and rationing go into effect , Mr. Baruch replied : ? " Right now . Tout suite . Today . " ' Senator Irving M. Ives , . Repub. ' lican of New York , who said the witness had earned his title both as " America 's Elder Statesman and America 's Greatest Prophet , " was among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American people . " The people ought to be told the facts , " Mr. Baruch replied . " All they want to know ' is why . " ? In answer to a question from Senator John J. Sparkman , Democrat . of Alabama , Baruch declared that the country " militarily , economically and spiritually is worse off today than . it was at the outbreak of World War II . " Another Republican , Senator Homer Capehart of Indiana , demanded to know how Congress could sell the Baruch plan to the American people if the President were opposed to it . " He has not recommended it , " Mr. Capehart said . " Yet he is the only person who has all the facts , We do n't have them . You do n't have them . " Mr : Baruch admitted that this posed a difficulty , hilt ' he ' , volunteered that he did not believe , that Mr. Truman " has evaluated the effect of allocations on prices . " He conceded that the President culled American activity in Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably " for , diplomatic reasons . " " To me , it is an emergency , " he commented . - Concluding witnesses of the day were spokesmen for the National Grange , the American Farm Bureau Federation , the National Farmers Union and the Chicago Board of Trade , the Kansas . City Board of . Trade and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange . The Grange and the Farm Bikreau Federation , ' represented by their presidents , A. IS . Goss and Allan B. Kline , respectively , urged that sections be dropped from the Administration bill to permit basic crop surpluses to be sold at lower prices , with private trading ' in ' these fields restricted . Senator Burnet ' R. Maybank , Democrat . of South Carolina , the committee chairman , supported by other , membas , indicated that these sections probably would be dropped or rewritten . He offered no encouragement , however , for a Grange proposal Ithat a joint Congressional committee be formed to see that the President did not misuse powers given him . The Grange proposed , also as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power by a two-thirds vote , if . power were abused . Russell Smith , speaking for the ' Farmers Union , also opposed disposal by the Government of surpluses at lower prices than were , now permitted , and , hammered away against proposed exemptions from application of antitrust laws . Walter R. Scott , on behalf of the three midwest grain exchanges , said Government-set requirements on commodity future trading would require farmers to " sell in a controlled market and buy Only in an uncontrolled market . " me House committee , which will start shaping up a final bill tomorrow , issued no statement on what it was told . The General , urging the press not to seek to ferret out his story , said he had talked to the committee " freely and openly . " In urging his program upon the Senate , Mr. Baruch emphasized that Korea was " not the arena of final decision . " " We dare not blind ourselves to the fact , " he said , " that we are in a race against the enemy  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent war ended , we scuttled and ran , demobilizing before the peace was won . " The Soviet Union , though , kept several million men under arms ; their munitions plants continued to produce sizable quantities of military weapons .
