The crowd was filing through the colonnades of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club when a ticket scalper spotted a possible customer heading for the main gate . Behind his dark sunglasses , the squat little man looked like a London clerk who had slipped away from the office to watch the finals of the 1954 Wimbledon tennis championships . <P> " Center court seat , sir ? " whispered the scalper . <P> The little man smiled . " No , thank you , " he said . " I shall have to stand during the match . " <P> The man in dark glasses was Jaroslav Drobny , the Czech exile who had already spent the better part of ten Wimbledon tournaments on his feet , but had never walked off the green center court with the trophy that he , and all tennis amateurs , aspire to : the Wimbledon Challenge Cup . <P> Political Kibitzers . Last week Drobny made his last all-out try for the trophy . An old man by tennis standards ( 32 ) , he was seeded No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . In the quarterfinals he polished off Australia 's hardhitting Davis Cupman Lew Hoad ; in the semi-finals his booming service disposed of American Budge Patty ( who had already knocked out Defending Champion Vic Seixas ) . In the finals , he found himself up against Ken Rosewall , a crafty , speedy and young ( 19 ) Australian , fresh from a five-set victory over top-seeded Tony Trabert of the U.S. <P> Unabashedly , the crowd-distinguished by such personages as Sweden 's King Gustave , the Duchess of Kent-made " Old Drob " its sentimental favorite . The son of the grounds keeper and the checkroom attendant at Prague 's old Ice Hockey and Lawn Tennis Club , he had worked his way into the fashionable world of topflight tennis through the back door , as a ballboy . <P> He played in his first Wimbledon tournament 16 years ago , when Ken Rosewall was only three . In postwar Czechoslova kia , Drobny was a national sport hero . <P> But when the Communists took over in Prague and began to lob dialectics onto the tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 , while playing a tournament in Switzerland , Drobny and his doubles part ner . Vladimir Czernik. refused to go home when the Czech government told them to bow out because a German and a Spaniard had entered . Life as a stateless tennis amateur was not easy . Drobny moved to Australia , then the U.S. , always broke between matches . When a wealthy Egyptian tennis fan offered him a job and a chance to play all the tennis he wanted , Drobny became an Egyptian citizen , ultimately developed his own profitable export business . <P> Relaxed &; Careful . A canny old campaigner , Drobny took his time warming up in the Wimbledon final . He chased only the shots he was sure he could get and he surprised the crowd by pounding steadily to Rosewall 's backhand , probably the best in amateur tennis . The first set went to 13-11 before Drobny ran it out . <P> After that 24-game marathon . Old Drob looked tired . But he stuck to his relaxed and careful plan . Rosewall won the next set , 6-4. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngster . In the third set , Old Drob changed tactics , and built himself a veritable wall at the net . Rosewall could rarely pass him ; when he tried to lob over him . Drobny 's overhead shots spattered all over Rosewall 's end of the court . Drobny won that set 6-2.
