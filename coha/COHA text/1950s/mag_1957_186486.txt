EVERY Israeli artist faces an age-old dilemma . <P> Scripture forbids the creation of graven images. * but the compelling affirmation of the Talmud is " This is my God and I shall adorn Him . " The solution for one of Israel 's leading artists . Yehoshua Kovarsky , 49 , was to move into his own kind of abstract symbolism , while holding to the philosophy that " an abstraction must have meaning for the viewer . " <P> There is meaning in the most brilliantly realized of Kovarsky 's works , a series of seven large ( 40 in. by 52 in. ) canvases depicting the seven-day creation of the world ( see color page ) . Shown last fall at Manhattan 's Jewish Museum , the series will be on view for the last time in Manhattan next week at a reception given by Israeli Minister Mordecai Kidron . Then it will be shipped to Israel ( where it will be shown later this year in the museums of Jerusalem , Tel Aviv and Haifa ) , along with the stacks of canvases Kovarsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> With the aid of the titles , it is easy to comprehend most of the unfolding mystery of the Genesis theme as Kovarsky has conceived it , e.g. : <P> Third Day shows the grey dawn of the first landscape , with the first signs of life emerging from primordial chaos . Says Kovarsky : " This tree has the twist of a motherly woman . The cloud is the symbol of rain . The red seed , poppy seed , is a symbol of growth . The sun-light . " <P> Fourth Day shows the molten sun and cooling moon pulling apart in the primary blue sky , while the first living things begin their incandescent dance of life . As for the dark cloud , Kovarsky suggests that it represents Lilith , the legendary predecessor of Eve , who has now become an evil spirit , roaming the desolate spaces . <P> Such Biblical and Talmudic images come naturally to Kovarsky , who was steeped in Jewish dogma and tradition during his childhood in Vilna , Lithuania , was sent to Palestine at 17 . His first direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working in a kibbutz ( collective settlement ) . There he found a fellow laborer , a Yemenite Jew named Zachariah. who could describe such legendary objects as the ancient Tabernacle so vividly that young Yehoshua was able to draw them . After finishing his art education in Paris , Kovarsky went back to Israel , isolated himself to paint in the ancient city of Safad , cradle of Jewish mysticism and cabalism . <P> With a reputation already made in Israel , Kovarsky with his wife , a former Martha Graham dancer , decided to go to New York six years ago . Says Kovarsky : " We had been cut off from the art world for ten years . I felt the need of something refreshing . New York cooks very fast , and it cooks nicely . It has a good smell . What was yesterday is gone . Yesterday 's car is n't enough . Today demands more . I will take a lot from here . " <P> Planning to return to Israel with his paintings , and to take new root there , Kovarsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he : " These people have in their mind an image . My desire is to find a language that will express their imagination . To be in contact with these primitive people will be for me now like getting to a fresh spring . " <P>
