' A Man 's Game ' ( See Cover ) The quarterback snaps " Let 's go , " the eleven burly men clap their hands in a single , sharp crack , and the offensive huddle dissolves . Then , taking his place behind the looming rump of his center , the quarterback looks with narrowed eyes across the line of scrimmage at the most formidable sight in professional football . <P> The four blue-jerseyed men facing him are mountains of muscle . Alert and agile as jungle cats , two linebackers crouch outside the ends . Ranged in an arc behind them are four lean , whippet-fast backs . <P> And a bare 2 yds. away from the quarter back , returning his stare in challenge , waits the key man of the proud New York Giant defense : Middle Linebacker Sam Huff ( 6 ft. 1 in. , 230 lbs. ) , a confident , smiling fighter fired with a devout desire to sink a thick shoulder into every ball carrier in the National Football League . <P> Rugged Red-Dogging . Sunday after Sunday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huff is likely to be in front of it . Sam Huff is strong enough to flatten a plunging fullback such as the Chicago Bears ' Rick Casares ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 225 Ibs. ) , swift enough to recover from a block in time to nail a halfback sprinting around end , smart enough to diagnose pass patterns and throw an offensive end off stride with an artful shoulder . But Huff is at his rugged best when he knifes through the line and " red-dogs " a quarterback as he fades to pass . <P> The crash of Huff 's tackle can stir the Giant bench to bellowing glee , set the rabid fans in Yankee Stadium to rumbling out their own rapid-fire cheer like the chugging of a steam engine : " Huff-Huff-Huff-Huff-Huff . " When Sam is on the field , the toughest fans in the U.S. 's toughest sport see what they came to see . <P> As thousands of new fans are happily discovering , pro football is a game of precise and powerful virtuosity - incredible catches , runners who break away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackles and jet-powered blocks . No experienced pro fan ever leaves a game in its last five minutes when his team is only two touchdowns behind-any club can , and may , explode in those five minutes and win . Pro football is a game in which every carefully selected , battle-tried man seems larger than life , not only in skill and speed , but in sheer brute strength .
