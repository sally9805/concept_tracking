 | THE KEPT WITNESSES At least eighty-three people have been set up by the government in the trade of " professional witnesses . " One calls it " a racket " ... three are confessed liars ... and all of them are exempt from security clearance . 0 N FEBRUARY 3 , 1955 , a press conference was called at the Hotel Biltmore in New York City for the purpose of providing a young man named Harvey Matusow with an opportunity to make a public confession of fraud and perjury . Along with the confession ? and necessary as a foundation for it ? went some items of biography . In 1947 , Matusow , who was then twenty , joined the Communist party . He claims to have taken this step as a dedicated revolutionist . Within a year or two , he said , he became disillusioned and penitent . The way of transgressors is hard . Matusow did not leave the party he no longer believed in . Instead , he stayed on as a voluntary agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a witness for the prosecution in the trial , in Federal Court , of thirteen leaders of the Communist party charged with conspiracy under the Smith Act . Matusow 's performance under oath ? some 700 @# pages in the trial record ? pleased the government attorneys , who won their case , and gained him an honored position as a kept , or professional , witness . That is to say , he made his living ? and a very good one , he now maintains , for a man of his age and station ? by being sworn and saying what those who paid him wished to have him say . Between 1951 and 1954 , his services were sought , and easily obtained , by the United States Department of Justice ; the Subversive Activities Control Board ; the Permanent Investigations Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Government Operations : the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee : the House Committee on Un-American Activities ; the Ohio Committee on Un-American Activities ; and the New York City Board of Education . He claims to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , and to have made 180 identifications of Communists , or of persons he chose to call Communists , for the various agencies that employed him . He found a good deal of additional employment . He hired out as a speaker in Congressional campaigns , in which , for a fee , he would damage this candidate or that one with intimations of subversion . He composed memoirs and revelations for the Hearst newspapers , lectured on the American Legion circuit , and now and then exploited himself and his past as a night-club entertainer and radio disc-jockey . In his New York press conference and in subsequent testimony before a Federal Grand Jury . and two committees of Congress , Matusow repudiated his career as a professional witness . He  | explained that he had walked down a city street one day and had been deeply moved by an eloquent call to piety and virtue which he found inscribed on a sign outside a synagogue . He had not been living the good life . The testimony he had given was riddled with lies . In case after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabricated evidence , sometimes on his own initiative , sometimes at the instigation of government lawyers . He was now filing affidavits in support of requests for new trials for many of those he had . helped convict . Such was his remorse that he was willing , he said , to risk the penalties of perjury to undo the damage he had clone . THIS , AT ANY RATE , is Matusow 's story . And it appears to have something in common with the stories of at least two other people . Mrs. Marie Natvig and Lowell Watson , government witnesses in a recent proceeding before the Federal Communications Commission , have given the lie to their testimony . Both swore before the FCC that they had known as a Communist , one Edward Lamb , an Erie , Pennsylvania , newspaper publisher whose right as a television licensee had been called into question . Mrs. Natvig , a gaudy triple divorcee from Miami Beach , now says she lied not only about Lamb 's Communist record but about her own . She had invented a Communist past for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Kansas farrier who , like Matusow , had worked often for the Justice Department , disowned only his avouchments in the Lamb case . The recantations necessarily leave many matters in doubt . It is the misfortune of skillful dissemblers that their fellows can never give full faith or credit to anything they say . The regeneration of Matusow , Mrs. Natvig , and Watson may be causing unbounded joy in Heaven , but here it must be received with the cool skepticism that should have greeted their sworn testimony . " A liar is always lavish of oaths , " Pierre Corneille wrote three hundred years ago in Le Menteur , one of the great definitive works on the subject . The courts , the committees , the commissions , and the security panels before which Matusow and Mrs. Natvig were lavish of oaths will be a long time working over the tangled skein of evidence put in the record by this bedeviled youth and this odd woman . And certainly in Matusow 's case those who preside will , if they are possessed of the thought- fulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has not really recovered his amateur standing ? that he is , in point of fact , as much a professional as ever . Now he has written a book about his experiences . His press conference was called by the publishers of the book , the firm of Cameron k Kahn . There was a distinctly promotional air about the whole enterprise , and there was a distinctly Stalinist air about it , too . Cameron 8c Kahn is a house that up to now has specialized in Communist literature . In any case . lfatusow , whether genuinely purified or merely reverting to form , is once again capitalizing on the confidences of former associates ; now he is putting the finger not on Communists but on anti-Communists ? on Senator Joseph McCarthy , on Roy M. Cohn , on all his collaborators of the last four or five years . Is he once again on somebody 's payroll ? It is an uncharitable thought but an inescapable one . " This is a good racket , being a professional witness , " Matusow told the reporters when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Immediately the conference was over , he hurried to the Columbia Broadcasting Company studios for a telecast . PARTNERS IN THE RACKET T HE DEPARTMENT of Justice announced , soon after Matusow 's confession , that it would be among the agencies reviewing and re-evaluating the recanted testimony . The anonymous spokesmen for the Attorney General were a bit grudging and condescending about it . They pointed out that Matusow had given only " corroborative " testimony , as though this were some unimportant species of testimony , hardly worth the bother of looking into . ( Actually . there is no special category of evidence known as " corroborative . " It merely means , in this instance , that Matusow testified to facts also testified to by one or more other witnesses . Not only can two witnesses be wrong , but there are circumstances in which the withdrawal of one witness 's testimony destroys the legal value of another 's . ) But after Matusow appeared before the Grand Jury , and after Mrs. Natvig and Watson revealed their fabrications , the Department of Justice promised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could hardly do less . Men are in prison today in part because of evidence drawn from a confessed perjurer by Department lawyers .  | Neither the Department of Justice nor any other agency of government , however , has given any indication that the Matusow incident has led it to reconsider the moral , juridical , and political effects of the whole practice of retaining professional witnesses . On the contrary , ' it would appear that the government 's principal concern at this stage is to prevent Matusow 's latest set of confessions from discrediting the testimony of its other professionals . A federal judge has jailed him on the ground that his recantation is false and contemptuous and the Department has indicted Mrs. Natvig , not for the perjury she admits , but for having lied to its lawyers . IN A SENSE , of course , the government is profoundly right in wishing to protect its employees . One embezzler does not make thieves of all bankers . One spy in the State Department does not prove all diplomats disloyal . One perjurious witness for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet there is a difference . Matusow was asserting not the unverifiable but the self-evident when he said that it had been " a good racket , being a professional witness . " As rackets must be judged , it was a good one for hint , certainly ; and , since Matusow 's talents are unusual but not unexampled , it may , at this moment , be equally good for others . And if it is a good racket for anyone , it is a racket for which the government of the United States must bear the heaviest responsibility . For it is the government of the United States ? " that august conception , " as Samuel Taylor Coleridge once called it ? that originated this racket and that continues to encourage and pay for it . Matusow was in partnership with the government . The government 's use of professional witnesses has at least this much in common with a racket ? that information about it is exceedingly difficult to come by . The whole affair is veiled in secrecy . The government wo n't talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plead that the safety of the nation would be imperiled if it revealed the number and the identity of those whom it hires to testify according to the wishes of its lawyers . It does not plead the right to withhold the names on the ground that these people are confidential informers ; obviously it can not do that in the case of men and women who appear in open court . The government gives no reasons for its unwillingness to discuss or even to defend this phase of its operations , but it evidently holds to the view that it would not be in the public WITNESSES 27 interest to make any sort of public accounting in this matter. * In mid-1954 , though , some enterprising Washington journalists came into possession of a Department of Justice list which contained the names and earnings of thirty persons " regularly used as witnesses " and of fifty-three " occasionally used " in the period , spanning two Administrations , between July 1 , 1952 and May 31 , 1954 . This list has been made public , and the Department has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was complete is not known . It was specified that the eighty-three named were all under contract to the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department . There are others in other bureaus of the Department and in other executive agencies , and there are known to be several working for the legislative branch and the state governments . American public life on almost every level today is characterized by what can only be described as an obsession with problems of loyalty and internal security ; it is a rare public agency that does not have at least one division devoting itself to these problems , and it is a downright underprivileged one that does not have some judicial or semi- 28 HARPER 'S  | judicial apparatus for making the kind of distinctions the ruling obsession demands . These apparatuses require witnesses . At all odds , the Department of Justice had at least eighty-three kept witnesses in 1951. - It seems wholly reasonable to assume that , despite the defection of Harvey Matusow , the number is not smaller today . More likely than not , it is larger , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into being on July 9 of last year , has announced that it plans greatly to accelerate its work in this field and aspires to produce an ever-mounting volume of prosecutions under the Smith Act , the Communist Control Act of 1954 , and all other available statutes . Of the eighty-three persons retained by the Department in 1951 , all were , by their own admission , former members of the Communist party . Some , like Benjamin Gitlow , one of the first American Bolsheviks and once Communist candidate for Vice President , had been true believers ; others , like Matthew Cvetic , whose exploits as an undercover agent were celebrated in a radio serial called " I Was a Communist for the FBI , " had been quite the opposite but had infiltrated the party at the direction of Mr .. Hoover 's famous agency . A few , like Harvey Matusow. had made the transition from revolutionist to counterrevolutionist inside the party . Those who are public servants now receive twenty-five dollars a day plus dine dollars " in lieu of expenses . " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought out on cross-examination iii several trials and hearings . Some witnesses may receive more , others less ; thirty-four dollars a day appears to be the prevailing fee . THE WAGES OF REPENTANCE B Y GOVERNMENT standards , this is fairly high pay . And it is high iii comparison with what some of the kept witnesses made before entering government service . Harvey Matusow was earning thirty-five dollars a week in 1951 . The job formerly held by Paul Crouch ? who earned $9,675 from the Department in two years of witnessing ? was as an air-line employee at eighty-five cents an hour . Leonard Patterson was a New York taxi-driver . Many of the others were paid functionaries of the Communist party , which means that their pay was low and infrequent . To satisfy the statute under which the payments are authorized ? the General Services and Administrative Act of 1919 ? the people who receive them are carried on the books not as kept witnesses but as " expert consultants . " But kept witnesses is what in fact they are : such usefulness as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness to identify people as Communists , to describe Communist activities for the enlightenment of judges , juries , and security panels ; and to interpret Communist doctrine in such a way as to bring it within the area proscribed by the Smith Act . Some critics ? notably Joseph and Stewart Alsop , who first brought the problem of kept witnesses to public attention ? have urged that a distinction be made between those who have been paid large sums and those who have been paid small sums . It is proper , they point out , to describe a witness such as Manning Johnson , who is credited with earnings of 59,096 in a two-year period , as a professional . However , some on the Department list are credited with amounts that can only be considered as pin money : two or three hundred dollars iii twenty-six months . Obviously , some sort of distinction ought to be made between those who earn enough to live on and those who do not . But because of the Department 's refusal to provide information , it is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alsops accepted the bootlegged list from the Department and concluded that there were only twelve witnesses " who have earned enough so that one may reasonably presume the sums were meaningful to them . " Harvey Matusow was not one of the twelve , for the Department of Justice had hint clown as a witness " occasionally used " and listed his earnings as only seventy-five dollars . It has since developed that the one list so far circulated tells only part of the story . Matusow got seventy-five dollars from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and $1,407 from a separate account with the Attorney General 's office . There are certain ironies connected with the purely procedural aspects of the Department 's relations with its paid witnesses . The General Services Act , which provides the legal authority for their retention , was passed by the Eighty-first Congress very largely because it had the formidable endorsement of the Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of Government , headed by Herbert Hoover . The Hoover Commission had been distressed to learn that certain agencies of the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American specialists in such fields as science and education because they lacked any means for retaining them on a part-time basis . The Commission prepared a plan to enable certain agencies to draw up and offer contracts retaining specialists on a per diem basis . It was accepted with enthusiasm by the Congress . An additional advantage of the scheme , it was thought , was that it made it possible to obtain the services of qualified advisers without the delays and embarrassments caused by the protracted rituals of loyalty and security checks . So far , the most conspicuous use to which the law has been put is the hiring as " expert consultants " of the Dormer Communists and police agents who make up the Department 's corps of professional witnesses . And one of the most conspicuous uses to which the professional witnesses are put is in establishing by sworn testimony that certain other employees of the government are loyalty and security risks . THUS , the key figures in the field of loyalty and security clearance are men and women who are themselves ? almost alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for clearance . More than that , they compose a group whose individual members would have almost no chance of getting clearance if it were required of them . It reflects not at all on their present condition of rectitude and probity to say that their pasts reek of subversion and sedition and that a number of them are convicted felons . One of the most prominent , for example , is Morris Malkin , formerly a union hoodlum and twice convicted for felonious assault . Another is Paul Crouch , generally regarded as the professional witness with the most experience and the highest earnings , who was once court-martialed for offenses against the Military Code of Justice , sentenced to forty years of hard labor on Alcatraz Island , and dishonorably discharged from the Army . Fortunately relieved of any accountability for these aspects of their past , they play a crucial role in determining who is and who is not of sufficient uprightness to work for the United States government . And as witnesses in other proceedings , the professionals play a crucial role in determining many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of places where they may turn up in the course of their service to the Department of Justice and apparently in fulfillment of their agreement with it . While under contract to the De-WITNESSES 29 partment , Matusow was a witness in departmental trials of a number of New York public school teachers . Paul Crouch , the dishonorably discharged buck private , filed with Senator McCarthy 's Committee on Government Operations a bizarre memorandum describing a plot to subvert our entire military establishment which he claims to have hatched with the late Mikhail Tukhachevsky , Marshal of the Red Army , thirty years ago . This bit of delayed intelligence provided , according to Roy AL Cohn , the impetus for the investigation of the Army Signal Corps ' radar laboratories at Fort Monmouth , New Jersey ? a piece of work that uncovered not a single Communist but did incalculable harm not only to government research but to the government 's relationship with the whole scientific community . Called by Congressmen hostile to the admission to statehood of the territory of Hawaii , Crouch took the oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposed at length on Communism on the islands . William Garfield Cummings , one of the most ubiquitous of the breed , testified , along with Mrs. Natvig and Lowell Watson , before the FCC in the Lamb case . In Louisville , Kentucky , an obscure journalist was indicted for promoting civil disorder : to the good fortune of the state attorney truing the case , there chanced to be on the Department of Justice 's list a Mrs. Alberta Ahearn , who was prepared to say that she knew the defendant as a Communist . Alarming Johnson and Leonard Patterson , seasoned performers on the Smith Act wheel , appeared as witnesses against Dr. Ralph Bunche of the United Nations Secretariat . UN-AMERICAN ? B E C A U S E the government takes the view that its dealings with its professional witnesses are privileged , it is impossible to take the true measure of their influence . But it is clear beyond all dispute that one agency , the Department of Justice , is subsidizing testimony not only in many of the cases it is legitimately prosecuting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of other cases , some of them flagrantly political . Even the subsidy it provides for witnesses in its own prosecutions is a problem serious enough to warrant investigation and examination . It is a novel arrangement , this hiring old people to take a solemn oath and testify  | favorably to the government . American history offers no precedent for it . The use of paid informers by police departments and federal agencies such as Internal Revenue is neither precedent nor true parallel . The paid informer 's job is to aid the authorities in the uncovering of crimes and the apprehension of criminals . He may sometimes be called as a witness , just as the paid witness may sometimes be used as an informer , but generally speaking the functions are separate , and the witness enters upon the scene only when the work of the informer is clone . It has long been recognized that the maintenance of order in a society such as ours requires the use of paid informers , but the professional witness up to now has made an appearance only as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of certain businesses , reputable except in this particular , which are frequently engaged in litigation . Up to now , he has not been associated with the United States government . Circumstances may justify the association today , but it nevertheless violates the spirit of our law and jurisprudence . We do not ask witnesses to meet rigorous tests of disinterestedness , as the Romans did , but we have always insisted that the giving of testimony is a bounden duty of citizenship , like the payment of taxes . It is expected that it will be done freely and in good faith . When expectations fail , the law steps in . The subpoena power exists to compel testimony . Our courts are empowered to require witnesses to furnish bonds tinder certain conditions , and witnesses may be jailed to assure their appearance and prevent their being tampered with . Failure to meet certain prescribed rules and standards may lead to citations for contempt of court . It is recognized that the discharge of this responsibility of citizenship is in many ways onerous and that it generally entails some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness fees . But these , like payments to jurors , are deliberately kept so low that they can not in any sense be regarded as rewards or even as just compensation . Four dollars a clay is the regular Department of justice fee . IN CERTAIN cases , it is true , the courts tolerate payment by one side or the other to witnesses who can provide highly specialized knowledge . The general rule of law is that this may he done in the case of men upon whose observation and counsel , outside the courtroom . society itself sets a price . Doctors , alienists , and property appraisers are perhaps the most frequently encountered types . These may be paid by principals in the case , provided the fact of their payment is made known to the court and provided there is no contingency basis for the agreement ; the payment of witnesses can under no circumstances be made to depend upon the outcome of the case . But even with these conditions the practice has always been regarded as a dubious one , and jurors are allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witness testifying before them is being paid for his version of the truth . " The experience of the ages , " Justice Chadwick of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington once wrote , " sustains the legal conclusion that where the truth is made to depend upon the pecuniary interest of a witness ... his utterances wear a cloak of suspicion , and they should not be accepted unless the taint is removed by the testimony of credible witnesses or by circumstances that can not be denied . " THE CLOAK of suspicion is a garment that must he wrapped several times around the witnesses for whose services the Department of justice has contracted . For one thing , their pecuniary interest ? assuming , for the moment , that thirty-four dollars a day constitutes one ? has the unusual character of a continuum . Ordinarily , where the possibility exists that the cupidity of a witness , or even his simple exigency , will color his testimony and thereby thwart justice , it exists only for a specific case at a specific time . The experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied enough to give them direct knowledge of more than a few matters that may be subject to litigation during their lives . But an accident of history puts the ex-Communist , whether his faith was feigned or authentic , in possession of an extraordinarily negotiable thing ? his past . As Whittaker Chambers , who has given testimony but has never become a professional and who has confronted the problem of negotiable pasts with candor and deep insight , has written , " He the ex-Communist anti-Communist witness risks little . He sits in security and uses his special knowledge to destroy others . He has that special information to give because he knows those others ' faces , voices , and lives , because he once lived within their confidence .... "  | Such an ex-Communist has acquired an expertise for which the demand is , apparently , inexhaustible . His patron , the Department of Justice , seems to measure its usefulness by the number of people it has jailed , by the number of deportations it can claim , by the number of loyalty and security risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the Department 's hope to prosecute the thirty thousand or so American Communists one by one ; it recently got a start in this direction by convicting one Claude Lightfoot in Chicago for violation of the Smith Act ? not as a leader of the Communist conspiracy , not as a teacher of the doctrine of violent overthrow of the government , but as a mere member of the conspiracy , a mere adherent of the doctrine . With this conviction , which may well be justified by both the law and the public interest , whole new horizons open up for the Department and its witnesses . CONVENIENT MEMORIES W HAT IS wanted now , what is likely to be wanted more and more in the immediate future , is identifications ? identifications in great numbers . Plainly enough , there could be rewards for an elastic memory . The possibility exists , almost without end , of the truth being made to depend on the pecuniary interest of witnesses . Putting aside what may be the singular case of Matusow , there have been , to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of record suggest the nature of the lurking dangers . Louis Budenz , a former editor of the Daily Worker , who has testified that his income from all sources as an anti-Communist witness and publicist has exceeded $10,000 a year , spent what he maintains was three thousand hours giving the names of Communists to the FBI . In none of those sessions , Budenz has conceded , did he offer the name of John Carter Vincent or Owen Lattimore . But when Senator McCarthy named both these men in various connections , all of them unfavorable , it came to Budenz , quite certainly , that they were Communists . He so testified before several Congressional committees and grand juries . Likewise , Paul Crouch talked to the FBI on many occasions , testified in numerous trials , and submitted to Congressional committees the names of all Communists he had known aside from rank-andfile members . Not once did he list a certain Jacob WITNESSES 31 Burck , a Chicago newspaper cartoonist . When , however , Burck was the subject of a deportation hearing , Crouch testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Committee of the Communist party . The memory is notoriously the most vagrant of human faculties , but there are few cases on record of a bent for mnemonic topicality as powerful as that revealed by Paul Crouch . In some instances , it is possible to rule out avarice altogether as an explanation for the weather changes his recall has undergone . In a large number of documents that he prepared and read in evidence before the Subversive Activities Control Board and a number of Congressional committees , he recounted at length his experiences in the Soviet Union during the period in which he was preparing the campaign to subvert the American military establishment . In these , he mentioned associations with Russian leaders so numerous and so mighty in power as to expose himself to reproaches for name-dropping . Up to 1953 , there was one name that did not turn up on any of the lists ? that of Georgi Malenkov . In March of 1953 , Malenkov succeeded to the Premiership of the Soviet state , and in March of 1953 , Crouch , filing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on Government Operations , revealed for the first time that the new Premier was among those with whom he had conferred in 1927 . Crouch has acknowledged a weakness that may in his case help explain such quirks . Before an Army court martial in 1925 , he testified : " I am in the habit of writing letters to my friends and imaginary persons , sometimes to kings and other foreign persons , in which I place myself in an imaginary position . I do that to develop my imaginary powers . " In the Leviathan , Hobbes wrote that " Imagination and memory are but one thing , which for divers considerations hath divers names . " No free man 's rights are put in jeopardy , no principle of law is dishonored when Crouch either imagines or abruptly recalls Georgi Malenkov as an old comrade-in-arms . But he has had frequent lapses and recoveries involving persons who do qualify for our law 's protection . At the trial of Harry Bridges in 1949 , Crouch denied acquaintance with a Communist agitator named David Davis . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court . " I had no knowledge of David Davis . " By 1951 , however , he had not only heard of David Davis , he had encountered him as early as 1928 . He was  | examined by a federal judge about a Communist meeting allegedly held in 1928 : Q. Was Mr. Davis present ? " A. " Yes , your honor . " On May 6 , 1949 , Crouch testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and was asked if he knew a man named Armand Scala , an officer of Miami Local 500 of the Transport Workers Union : A. " Very well , with Local 500 . " Q. " Is he a member of the Communist party ? " A. " I do not know ... I do not know of my own knowledge what his party affiliations are . " But on May 11 , five days later , Crouch put into the record of the Committee a statement and several affidavits amplifying his earlier testimony . In one , he said : " Another member and officer of Local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami is Armand Scala . Scala had been the chief Communist courier to Latin American countries . " In an article published in the Hearst newspapers a few days after that , he made an even more explicit identification of Scala as " the chief courier of the party in Latin America .. . traveling to Buenos Aires and Rio dc Janeiro frequently on party business . " In a subsequent libel suit , he swore to the truth of these assertions . Since the newspaper stories had not been privileged , Scala was awarded $5,000 . It may well be that Crouch was , as he presently insists , testifying to the best of his recollection on each specific occasion . No more can be asked of anyone . But the fact can not be blinked that the use of subsidized testimony increases the danger of subsidized perjury . The rule of law against contingent fees is not directly violated by the contractual agreements the Department of Justice has with Crouch and other witnesses . These agreements are signed , sealed , and delivered in advance of testimony ? sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorn has testified that she received $125 a month for two years simply to hold herself ready to take the witness stand . However , the clear moral principle upon which the rule of contingency rests is abused by the practice . The Department 's list of the navies and earnings of the " persons regularly used as witnesses " shows wide variation in income among the professionals . An element of contingency accounts for the variations . A witness gets his fee whether the case is settled favorably or unfavorably for the government , but common sense ? and even the solicitousness for the taxpayer of which the government boasts ? must suggest that the witness who can assist in the production of the greatest number of convictions is the witness who should get the most work . In the Department of Justice ? as , for that matter , in most lesser prosecuting agencies throughout the country ? success is quantitatively measured . It has been customary in this country to take what steps we can to prevent the quantitative measurement of truth . The use of professional witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should at least be recognized as a step in the other direction . RISING ABOVE TRUTH JUSTICE CHADWICK 'S cloak of suspicion is becoming to the professional witness for reasons other than those of pecuniary interest . If a heavy risk is run of his memory being stimulated by the prospect of increased emoluments , there is an equally heavy risk that he will visit , not the truth as he knows it , but the fury of disenchantment as he feels it on those against whore he testifies . There is no way of being certain of how many of the professional witnesses are genuine apostates and how many are merely former police agents . ( It is FBI policy never to confirm or deny an individual 's statement regarding instructions he claims to have had from the Bureau , and this has led to a certain amount of confusion . Matthew Cvetic told the House Un-American Activities Committee that George Dietz and Joseph Mazzei were members of the Communist party in Pittsburgh . Dietz and Mazzei , fired from their jobs , indignantly declared that they . too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Bureau on Cvetic 's numerous subversive connections . Similarly , doubts were cast on the bona fides of William Garfield Cummings as an FBI agent when it was revealed that his membership in the Communist party antedated his recruitment by the Bureau and that he encouraged continued service to the party by friends and relatives after he left it . ) In any event , a considerable number of the professional witnesses are disaffected Communists and clearly carry the stigmata and disabilities . along with the special insights , of their kind . Many of them display what may be regarded as a touching eagerness to serve the society they once sought to destroy ; in some of their cases , this laudable sentiment is fused with what may more  | reasonably be described as a thirst for revenge . ? fen 's defects are often only the flaws in their rtue ; the flaw may render the virtue nugatory. fanning Johnson , once an ardent Communist . td more recently an ardent patriot , testified Clore the Subversive Activities Control Board gat it is an article of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : O. In other words , you will tell a lie under oath in a court of law rather than run counter to your instructions from the FBI . Is that right ? A. If the interests of my government are at stake . In the face of enemies , at home and abroad , if maintaining secrecy of the techniques of methods of operation of the FBI who have responsibility for the protection of our people , I say I will do it a thousand times . Again Manning Johnson , this time in a sedition trial in Pennsylvania and undergoing examination on his testimony in a deportation proceeding that had taken place earlier : Q. That testimony was not correct , was it , Mr. Johnson ? A. No , it was n't , precisely , because I could not at that time reveal that I had supplied information to the FBI . . . . I think the security of the government has priority over ... any other consideration . The fear of systems of priorities such as Mr. Johnson 's has given rise to the legal doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no witness . But a difficulty raised by the Justice Department 's use of professionals , and by its policy of withholding information about it , is that two or more witnesses may share this view , or a similar one . We do not know how many people have been convicted , deported , and discharged from government service on evidence supplied wholly by kept witnesses . THROUGHOUT the history of societies living , or trying to live , under the rule of law , the role of the witness has been a vexatious problem for judges , lawyers , and all others who have concerned themselves with it . Broadly speaking , the tendency in most Western nations has been a steady easing of restrictions . When systems of law are young , jurists cling to the hope that truth will be received only from undefiled sources . This is sooner or later found to be an impossible aspiration , and in some respects a false one , though it is unquestionably noble in spirit . The judicial process , to be sure , must WITNESSES 33 @# always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the truth . But we know from long experience that the truth is often found in the unlikeliest places . The fact that a Manning Johnson hates and fears Communists , feels betrayed by them , and regards every living one of them as a menace to the whole of humanity does not mean that he is incapable of ever telling the truth about them . What it does mean is that he may possibly tell something other than the truth ? and that those who use ham as a source of information must be vigilant against the possibility of receiving misinformation . It is doubtless necessary to use the Manning Johnsons of this world . Society has little choice in the matter . As police and prosecuting officials like to point out ? when they are rebuked for their use of low , untrustworthy characters as informers and witnesses ? it is very seldom possible to find bishops and cardinals who are widely acquainted among felons and well-informed on the workings of vice syndicates , counterfeiting gangs , dope peddlers , smuggling rings , and the like . Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of itself , and it can not afford to scorn information about then that comes from persons it regards with distaste and does not entirely trust ? even from persons deeply implicated in the crimes under review . Though it would be agreeable to adhere to the view of Lord Langdale , who ruled in a famous nineteenth-century judgment , that " a witness has no business to concern himself with the merits of the case in which he is called , " we must realize that in many cases no such witness exists .  | Because truth often turns up where it is the least expected , and because we have a steady need of truth from whatever source , we have progressively reduced the number of factors disqualifying witnesses and progressively increased our reliance on the power of the witness 's oath , the perjury laws , and crossexamination . Up to now , though , we have not accommodated ourselves to the idea of witnesses who make a business of being witnesses . It may be that the time has come when we must do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that we must accept this device for coping with it . But if this is the case , it would seem as if the problem ought to be squarely faced . The Department of Justice should , in that event , abandon its present furtiveness and give a full public accounting of the terms and conditions upon which it purchases testimony . It should recognize , as Justice Holmes did in his weighing of the merits of wire-tapping , that the government is caught in a conflict of competing " objects of desire " ? the desire to catch criminals and the desire to maintain governmental integrity . ( " We have to choose , " Holmes said , " and for my part I think it a less evil that some criminals should escape than that the government should play an ignoble part . " ) There may be an equitable and decent way of resolving the conflict , but no conflict can be resolved without first acknowledging that it exists . THE LARGEST QUESTION I N ANY serious weighing of the issues , it would be necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice to individuals . That is , of course , the largest question of all in any free and open society . But it is not the only one . When the federal government subsidizes a group such as its present corps of professional witnesses , it finds itself , willy-nilly , subsidizing a special political interest . Many of the larger categories of cases tried under federal law involve political principles , political ideas , political organizations . The Communist cases manifestly do , and not the least of the effects of the government 's policy has been to give those professional witnesses who are also professional politicians and ideologues an opportunity to exert a considerable influence on public opinion and public policy in ' natters on which they have a special , if not an eccentric , outlook . It should not strain credulity to suggest that if there has been prevalent in recent years a somewhat distorted view of the dimensions of the problem of domestic Communism the fault can in large part be charged to the account of the Department of Justice and its professional witnesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on the public view of the Communist problem than Louis F. Budenz . On the basis of his reputation as the government 's leading witness iii Smith Act cases and before Congressional committees , he has established an ahnost universal acceptance of himself as a high authority and of his books , articles , lectures , and television discourses as bearing some imagined seal of official approval . Elizabeth Bentley , J. B Matthews , Benjamin Gitlow , Howard Rushmore . Bella Dodd , and Joseph Kornfeder run not vets far behind . ( Whittaker Chambers has also been enormously influential , but of him it must be said that his writings lend more authority to his testimony than his testimony lends to his writings . He is not , therefore , of this company . ) Lesser witnesses have established lesser reputations on the strength of their endorsement by the government . Moreover , they have had and ale having a direct influence on policy and law ? no : through appeals to public opinion but through direct appeals to the governing powers . Paul Crouch tells the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be run . Matthew Cvetic is called by the Senate Rules Committee to advise on the thorny question of rules lot Congressional investigations . Maurice Malkin. the ex-convict , himself eligible for deportation and denaturalization , is called before the Senate Subcommittee on Naturalization and Immigration to make recommendations . ( He thought there were too many avenues of appeal . He said that once it is proved that anyone is a member " of a certain organization , he should be deported without further hearings of any sort . " ) Almost the entire membership of the Department corps was summoned before the ? a document that more perhaps than any other has formed the prevailing image of Communist infiltration in the nineteen-thirties and forties . The kept witnesses have been given an opportunits to foul American due process and quite a bit else besides .
