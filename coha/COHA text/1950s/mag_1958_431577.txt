 | WHO IS LYNDON JOHNSON ? @# An intimate report on the second most powerful man in America ? and one of the least understood ? by the Pulitzer prize-winning Capitol correspondent of the New York Times . MU C H of the power of practical decision 1 ' 1 within the Democratic party ? and , indeed , within the United States government itself ? will rest for this year , and for the year beyond and yet the next , in the restless , brilliant , and volatile mind of one of the country 's least understood public men . Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , the Democratic leader of the Senate , will also be the leader-infact of the Democratic party until it chooses a new one in both fact and form , at its 1960 convention . His own nomination for the Presidency is highly improbable ? and would so remain even if he should reverse his present attitude and court the job . All the same , in the three intervening years he will be far more than an elevated party caretaker ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little short of that of President Eisenhower himself ? and might in some matters and at some times actually be the greater . Not often , if ever , has a man of Congress ? in this case specifically a man of the Senate ? created so powerful a position for himself or confronted such favorable circumstances for the exercise of that power . The grip of the Administration is inevitably and progressively weakening ; the locus of crisis is swinging , even more perceptibly than last year , toward the Capitol : incomparably the most puissant figure in that vaulted and Romanesque place is Lyndon Johnson . But far less often ? if , in fact , ever ? has such a man in such a context been the subject of such diverse estimates from writers and the public . There is nothing approaching a common view , or even what might be called a consensus view , of Senator Johnson . He is , in this sense , a man of mystery ? though not really an opaque one . One can go a long way toward solving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic , living example of what it means to be always caught in the middle . He is , to put it another way , the very embodiment of the traditional definition of politics as the art of the possible . An ineluctable common sense is a profound ( not merely a strong ) impulse in his public career . He knows perfectly well all the time what is perceptible most of the time to those who are able to view political issues and personalities without violent emotion . This is the fact that almost no acute problem , political or otherwise , is ever settled perfectly and ideally and without a good deal of adjustment on both sides . Moreover , this adjustment nearly always calls for some filing away of the sharpest protruding edges of what each side will identify , fairly or not , with the word " principle " ; often it also demands an unashamed brushing under the rug of certain inconvenient and ill-fitting remnants of the accommodation . As a political commander he is not interested in Charges of the Light Brigade ; he welcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Lord Montgomery i11 the second world war , Johnson is never happy to involve himself or his troops in gallant operations doomed in advance and useful only to those who love a lost cause . He does not fight for practice , for the spectators , for history ? or even solely to vanquish the enemy ? but only for highly measurable and affirmative motives . Again like Montgomery , he willingly commits himself to action only  | when coolly detached analysis indicates that he has a good to excellent chance to win and ? equally important ? a better than even chance to hold his own party 's casualties within reasonable bounds . This kind of position makes poor stories and poorer legends , because it makes damn few heroes . Its only virtue is that it is usually effective . WHY " LIBERALS " DISTRUST HIM J O H N S O N , in a word , is a highly professional legislative leader ; and like many great pros , he makes it look easy . He gives off none of that impression , so satisfying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " He is able , yes ; but is he sincere ? " ) To lead in this seemingly casual way ? and moreover to lead always from the middle and thus inevitably never to be fully accepted in blood comradeship with either the left or the right of his party ? means that he necessarily inflicts recurring wounds upon the amour-propre of each wing , not to mention those articulate observers who are emotionally engaged with the one or the other . To be " moderate " anywhere in active ( that is , elective ) politics is never easy . For a party leader , who by definition is supposed to be a more or less perfect partisan brandishing the sword and never sounding retreat , the rewards of such a posture are somewhat attenuated . And the position is especially difficult to maintain within the Democratic party . It is very proud of its martial traditions and its rank and file often tend to prefer a dramatically moving to a quietly successful show . Thus , Johnson is fully appreciated only by the politically sophisticated . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers who quite simply like to watch a true virtuoso in action ; and ( 2 ) those fellow partisans whose objective gratitude for his unarguably high services to his party in general is strong enough to overcome their subjective resentment when ( as is bound to happen sooner or later ) his centrist position operates to reject their own convictions and current designs . And Johnson 's own personality , temperament , and taste do nothing to soothe his critics . He is a pragmatic man and not a theorist ; an actionist and not a philosophic thinker . His political experience ? and it has been an immensely crowded one considering that he is yet this side of fifty ? has told him certain things that no amount of theoretical considerations can alter . He knows perfectly well , for exampl : that not all Democrats are generous and a .. Republicans mean ; that the good guy ? bad pi % notion of politics is too attractively simple t , make much sense ; that there is not and can not be any neat and tidy division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surer : ways to complete political ineffectuality is to be absolutely awash with " principle " but barren of the practical means of converting it into legislative reality . Thus it is not merely expedience that has made him fairly unpartisan underneath and neither liberal nor conservative ? as these in finitely involved terms are generally understood . It is also personal preference . And though he is strongly touched with the open vanity that touches nearly all able politicians , neither cant nor hypocrisy nor preciousness is among his shortcomings . So , though he deeply ( and justifiably ) resents the view of many critics that he is simply a very clever political " operator , " he himself is partly to blame for the propagation of this notion . This is so because when he sets out upon some tour de force in the Senate ? of a kind in which repeatedly he has accomplished by cajolery and force an incredible degree of party unity ? he frequently does not announce that he is operating on the side of the angels . To the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his maneuvers unfold and so to leave the impression ? particularly with eitheror people whose sense of evangelism is strong ? that his extraordinary achievements must be credited to allies from a quite different spiritual world . Enchanted with the subtleties of a highly subtle political forum , he is ( especially in his private explanations of his strategies ) inclined to be one of those who refer to that well-known implement as a ruddy shovel . He displays what appears to be ? and sometimes is ? a touch of cynicism ; he is not a careful man in some ways , and does not always protect his flanks . Once long ago , for example , I asked Senator Johnson why , as the leader of the Democratic party in the Senate , he did not signal a general assault upon the late Senator Joseph R. McCarthy . " I am not about to commit my party , " he told me , " to a high-school debate on the question ' Resolved that Communism is good for the United States of America ' ? with my party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not that he condoned McCarthyism , but that he recognized that it was itically unassailable at the moment by his party , reeling as it was then from charges of Communism , Corruption , and Korea " ; that an tack then would only fail and so promote 1cCarthy ; and that he was waiting for the day hen he could beat McCarthy down . This day came ? it was in fact Lyndon B. Johnson more than any other single person where of any station who broke McCarthy arranging for the Senate to condemn him . evertheless , Johnson never got full or even ajor credit with the public or with most commentators ; his bleakly candid shorthand summation of the earlier days stood in the way . THE UNTYPICAL SOUTHERNER T H E temptation to see Johnson as a kind of Clark genius is promoted , in a trivial sense , by his own somewhat somberly handsome personal appearance ( even here he has none of the windblown , terribly earnest , and self-conscious " wholesomeness " . of many politicians ) and by the small fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More importantly , this temptation is heightened by the fact that his personal tradition ( though he will be quite astonished to hear this ) is of the Southwestern rancher-aristocrat . Roughhewn though that type of colloquial and unconscious aristocracy is , it shares the unwillingness of aristocracy everywhere to explain or debate its own motives or to make any overt appeal to so-called moral considerations , as such , in public life . And though he is a hard , acute politician , never hesitant about laying his hand to every political advantage that he considers legitimate , his sense of privacy is ( even apart from his instinctive distaste for striking moral attitudes ) much stronger than average in his profession . The fact that he won the Silver Star for gallantry in the Navy during the second world war , for instance , does not appear in his official biographies . The tale is further complicated by the fact that Johnson is not only a fan of the Middle in politics ; he is also a bit lonely in a way in his own region . Geographically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair to say that to some of his critics this is his true , his infamous , his inexpiable and unremittable sin . But politically he is in , but not really of , the Senate 's Southern bloc . He is wholly acceptable there , yes . He knows his way around there , yes . He has a stentorian voice there , yes . But he is not , in a certain deep and intimate way , totally and instinctively at home there . For in the most personal sense , in his blood and his bones and his inherited memories and attitudes , he is hardly a Southerner at all in any common meaning of the term . Johnson had " family " but not wealth in his early years . Born near the little town of Johnson City , Texas ( which his grandfather founded ) , he was educated in its public schools and got a B.S. from Southwest Texas State Teachers College in 1930 . From college he went to schoolteaching and from there to Washington as secretary to Texas Representative Ric " hard Kleberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Texas as director of the National Youth Administration . Elected to Congress in 1937 , he continued in the House till he won his Senate seat in 1948 . After only five years , he was elected Democratic leader . In politics for nearly all of his adult life , he has enjoyed comparative wealth from his wife 's side of the family . Mrs. Johnson , the former Claudia Taylor of Karnack , Texas , was called Lady Bird by her childhood nurse and the name has stuck . The Congressional Directory lists her this way and one of the Johnsons ' two daughters is called Lynda Bird . Poised , basically intellectual , and infinitely more philosophic than her husband , she is his balance wheel . With humor and grace she fights a hopeless battle described as " trying to slow Lyndon down a little . " But the traditional Southern tempo ?  | and Southern attitudes ? are foreign to him . In the twenty-five years that I have known him , I have never heard Johnson speak nostalgically of " the Old South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unguarded of moments , even , let us say , over a glass or two of whiskey in a midnight hour of reminiscence and remembrance ? to identify himself with emphasis as a Southerner or to speak of a way of life now long gone . More specifically , I have never known him to say one word that could by any possible stretch of the imagination be interpreted as even faintly white-supremacist in attitude . The reason for all this is , almost certainly , not a consciously moral or ethical one . The probable explanation lies mainly in the fact that Johnson 's part of Texas is romantically attached not to the War Between the States but rather to the War of Independence against Mexico . Old Sam Houston of Texas , who had to carry a pistol in his waistband and his life in his hands in publicly fighting against Texas secession , was a family friend of the early Johnsons . Lyndon 's father was Sam Ealy Johnson , who in his day fought in the Texas legislature against hysterical mistreatment of German-Americans in South Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life has been a friend of the Mexican-Americans in Texas and while it is entirely true that he might never have reached the Senate in the first place without the very active support of some of the powerful South Texas rancher-bosses , it is certainly also true that anything but violence was done to the convictions of the vaqueros when it was , so to speak , suggested to them that they vote for Johnson . He is , in the racial , the religious , the ethnic sense , a truly tolerant nian , who never speaks of that fact . He is an authentic member ? as was his father before him ? of an otherwise ill-defined political movement iii Texas which has smashed down twentieth-century Ku Klux Klanism every time its head has been raised . This course , by the way , has not always been quite so easy or safe as it would have been in New York , say , or Michigan or Illinois . Johnson is entitled to no Medal of Honor for what has been simply a position of decency ; all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were , of the Spain ribbon in the old European Theater of Operations . Again , in attempting to measure what he stands for and what is he after politically , it is necessary to dwell for a moment on the obvious , though less than simple , fact that he is after all a Texan . Though this correspondent yieldto nobody in his distaste for those parts the new so-called Texas legend that are pilot's. the simple fact remains that these chaps , politically at least , are of a breed apart . Even current semantics are different there . In Texas ? where to most people a " conservative ' . is somebody like the right-wing former Governor Allan Shivers ? Johnson is in the middle to a most painful degree . To a substantial and powerful moneyed group he has often appeared to be pinkish , if not dangerously leftist ; one of this number was reluctantly persuaded that Johnson was not actually a " Communist " only upon such eccentric tests as the fact that he did not , after all , wear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , though he has backed the tidelands and natural-gas bills ( and necessarily injured his work as a national party leader on every such occasion ) , Johnson is hardly the darling of " the oil people , " as Easterners often believe . It is a fact that he has some very wealthy supporters but he is far from a consistent collector of fat cats ; his fat cats have joined him , rather than the other way round . The common run of these burstingly fiscal felines ? and there are so many of them in Texas that such a term as " common run " is accurate enough ? do n't like him now , never did , and never will . To a good many other Texans , whose liberalism is perhaps the more vehement for having so long been pressed down into the catacombs , Johnson is seen as a powerful and ruthless rightist ? though it is difficult to ascertain from them the precise basis for this estimate . Quite possibly it arises as much from Johnson 's manner as from his policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men upon this earth so actively and visibly stir his scorn as those politicians who have only good intentions . If he must deal either with an able SOB or a totally inept and moist doer of good works , he will unquestionably prefer the former , as regrettable as this taste may be . J O H N S O N has never failed to support a national Democratic ticket ? even the Stevenson ticket during the tidelands hysteria of 1952 in which this act was widely considered unTexan and as giving aid to the enemies of the Republic of Texas ? yet Texas liberals are in varying degrees suspicious of him or hostile . The fact that his defeat probably would proTHE POLITICIAN AS ARTIST  | duce an alternative Senator who would make Johnson look like the chairman of the ADA ? not to say the NAACP ? is reluctantly conceded by some in this dissident wing . It does not , however , diminish that wing 's active dislike of the senior Senator from Texas . Johnson has proceeded in Texas much as he has proceeded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his party either in Texas or at the Capitol , of any nexus of enduring power from either the right or the left wing of the party . While he does not run his organization affairs in a way that would altogether appeal to collegiate political scientists , he can not accurately be described as a political " boss " in either the Texan or the national context . Though he bestrides the Senate as no party leader ? not even Taft of Ohio ? has done in memory , he maintains his extraordinary footing there by meeting the most persuasive and objective of all criteria among politicians : the criterion of long demonstrated success . He has made himself very nearly the indispensable man of his party , in the Senate if nowhere else . Almost every angry criticism of him that one hears from other Democrats ? usually , but by no means always , from the liberal side of the party ? is followed with the hurried qualification to this effect : " Do n't get me wrong . Lyndon is still the ablest man we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time during his leadership ? not even on such occasions as when he brought up the natural-gas bill and for the time being deeply split his party ? when any substantial number of Senate Democrats has been prepared even to contemplate his replacement . This is true in spite of the fact that he is very far from being a tactful leader . His boiling point is markedly low at times , this having been especially true since his massive heart-attack in July of 1955 . He can be harsh with the rank and file and he can and does give brusque orders , quite heedless of Senatorial dignity , of a kind which even the redoubtable Taft would not have attempted . Last year , he coolly ? and successfully ? told more than one proud Southerner what and what not to say in the civil-rights debate . He did much the same with some of the advanced liberals . Such interventions are just this side of unheard of in the club that is the Senate . Senators will " take it from Lyndon , " where they certainly would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasons . One , and probably the most important , is that he is a good deal ELECTIONS 57 @# like a respected , if cantankerous , captain of an infantry company . His followers know that he is immensely skilled in the kind of warfare in which they must be engaged and that he will bring them through an action if anybody could . Again , he is on occasion extraordinarily thoughtful of his colleagues , with the little and publicly unnoticed actions of kindness that all men value . Finally , though he can be tough with out trying at all hard , he is free of pettiness and has very little vindictiveness in his nature . On certain issues , foreign and military affairs especially , he is almost totally unpartisan and highly responsible ? a fact recognized by Senate foe and friend alike . In these matters he has been heavily relied upon by President Eisenhower and other Republicans as well as the Democrats , and in all the present circumstances this reliance will increase rather than diminish . Johnson 's view toward the Administration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detachment . In world affairs he will do , precisely and simply , what he thinks the national interest requires . No one need expect him to forget for a moment any vital Texas interest ; nevertheless no Texas interest will ever cause him to do anything that seems  | to him in any deep way to injure the United States . And all this does not make him unique ; all of this could also be said of the Republican Senate leader , William F. Knowland of California . This man , Lyndon Baines Johnson of Texas , is perhaps the most complicated man in public life known to this correspondent . He is at once sentimental and distinctly clear-eyed . He is tireless beyond ready belief ; nearly all his waking life is spent as a furiously functioning one-man political organism . His understanding of men as individuals and his skill in dealing with them must be seen in action to be credited . Whether he understands people in the mass so well is perhaps open to question . WHAT DOES HE WANT ? HE I S highly ambitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disillusioned , and his attitude says clearly : To hell with it . His drive to power is notable ? most of the time . At times his streak of altruism is very strong ; I have seen tears of gratification in his eyes when , in the middle of great and urgent events , he learned of a success at the bar for a man he had coached in public speaking many years before in a Texas high school . He values money but is careless with it and of it . He sometimes storms at and drives his staff people but always he cares paternally for them in every sense , including the financial . He genuinely respects their opinions on every matter , even though he may be glowering at them at the very moment these opinions are uttered . He is excessively sensitive to criticism ? or rather to criticism from certain sources , and especially from those liberal Democrats whose beau ideal is still Franklin D. Roosevelt . Johnson himself reached the House of Representatives on a platform supporting FDR 's " court-packing " plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather , more or less incessantly ? accused by these liberals of having gone back on liberalism . But who has in fact gone back upon whom is very largely a matter of definition . Johnson on the record has been of more service to some ? though not all ? traditionally liberal enterprises ( notably public power , public housing , the defense of the right of inquiry and dissent ) than have most of his liberal critics put together . On the other hand , it is unquestionably true that in his years of maturity as a politician he has , on some issues , kept the professional liberals on a pretty thin diet . They tend to regard this circumstance as kind of betrayal . His view is that there ale few fixed and immutable total truths in politics , and that if he has served the liberals no more than half a loaf , they would have had far less bread if he had acted as they would like him to act . If he often is not fully aware of the validity of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any perceptiv e awareness of his problems in dealing with certain intractable realities ? the powerful Southern bloc among them ? that will not be blown away simply by proud , hot words and the stand-and-die technique . At all events , he is the man who now and for some time to come will be the nearest thing to the operating engineer of the Democratic part .. It is all but certain that he will have a considerable voice in the selection of the next Democratic Presidential nominee . It is anything but certain that he can , all through the second session of the Eighty-fifth Congress , maintain the desperately delicate North-South balance of some civility that he has thus far maintained against overwhelming odds . It is , however , quite certain that he is infinitely the most formidable guard the Democrats could possibly find to keep harrying watch upon their most brilliant antagonist between now and 1960 , Vice President Nixon . Nixon likely could win almost any contest with Johnson in the public arena ? as of now , at least . But it is 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vice President will meet his master in almost any power contest with Johnson within the arena of Congress itself ? except possibly on civil rights , an issue on which Johnson 's geographical situation ties one arm behind his back . Given all this about Lyndon Johnson , as person and as politician , what does he want and where is he going ? Among those who do not know the answers to these questions is Johnson himself . Certainly , he wants to go down in history as a great figure of the Senate , and this ambition may be said to have been pretty well reached . Does he want to be President , though he says not ? To this I can only offer belief : I believe that sometimes he does , but that most of the time he does not ? genuinely and objectively does not . I believe in short that this complex , this driven man ( driven not unworthily , but driven just the same ) does not , in the final and real and basic sense , know himself quite what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his life and his great heed . Politics to him , more than to any other politician I have ever known , is art for art 's sake .
