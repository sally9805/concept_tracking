Before such potent hormones as cortisone and ACTH were discovered , doctors could offer little to victims of rheumatoid arthritis except aspirin-simply , they thought , to ease the pain . But just when cortisone became generally available , researchers made a surprising discovery : far from being a mere painkiller , aspirin has the biological power ( like ACTH , but to a lesser degree ) of stimulating the adrenal glands to produce their cortisone-like hormones . Still , U.S. doctors took it for granted that cortisone itself must be better , went on prescribing it lavishly ( daily cost to U.S. patient : 40 to 60 ) . <P> Last week a joint committee of Britain 's Medical Research Council and the Nuffield Foundation reported that in cases of early rheumatoid arthritis , the lowly and inexpensive aspirin ( a couple of cents a day ) can hold its own . In the British Medical Journal they described the treatment of 30 patients with cortisone for a year , matched against 31 on aspirin . Stage by stage , the two groups stayed even Stephen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually free of pain and disability , and almost half were able to go back to work . The tests have no bearing on the value of hormones in more advanced arthritis , but in these early cases , say the Britons , " there appears to have been surprisingly little to choose between cortisone and aspirin .
