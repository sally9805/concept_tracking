The clock radio in the softly shadowed bedroom clicked on at 7:30 sharp , and the sleepers in the twin beds stirred slightly to the slushy beat of Mantovani and Softly as in a Morning Sunrise . The husband got up first to put on the coffee and slip a record on the hifi . As his wife relaxed for a few minutes more , planning her day , she could just hear the treacly organ notes of Music for Meditation dripping from the living-room Bozak . <P> It was a Monday , she meditated , and she had two hampers of dirty clothes to cope with . After her husband left for the 8:34 , she put on Music for Washing and Ironing , and the suave purring of the Somerset Strings , boosted real high , drowned out the snarl of the washer . When it was time for a midday snack , she returned to the built-in record cabinet and selected Music for Gracious Living and Music for Expectant Mothers ( her second child was on the way ) . Late in the afternoon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Music for a Rainy Night before her husband came home . <P> Over cocktails ( Music , Martinis and Memories ) he told her about the account he had lost that morning . Listening to him , she walked quietly to the phonograph and put Music for Courage and Confidence on the turntable . But for long hours after dinner ( Music for the Continental Host ) he paced the floor while the loudspeaker softly sighed out Music for People Who Ca n't Sleep . <P> This phonomaniac family is becoming more or less typical of uncounted U.S. households . Mood music-most of it consisting simply of old favorites and not-so-favorites warmed over-currently accounts for roughly a third of several major companies ' album sales . Such old grads of the whipped-cream-and-syrup school as Andr Kostelanetz , Paul Weston , Phil Spitalny and George Melachrino did some pioneering as early as the ' 40s , were later joined by a host of others . TV 's Jackie Gleason became such an adept mood picker that his Music for Lovers Only sold half a million copies . For the hi-fi convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors ' woofers and tweeters , the gaudily packaged mood music was ideal : it filled the yawning silence , but was so innocuous that nobody had to listen to it . <P> The mood merchants have concentrated on romance ( Music for Tired Lovers , Music to Change Her Mind ) , but dining ( Candlelight and Wine ) and travel music is also catching on fast ( Echoes of Spain , Music for the Nostalgic Traveler ) . So are such special items as Music for Baby Sitters and Music to Break a Lease . There are mood albums , the record companies boast , for every member of the family and for almost every household activity . Still , the possibilities remain vast . Not yet in the catalogue : Music for Boozing and Music to Soothe Your Hangover , Music to Shave By ( so far , the bathroom has scarcely been tapped ) , Music for the Analyst 's Couch , Music to Beat Your Wife By and Music to Spoil Your Taste for Music .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
