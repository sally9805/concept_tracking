Many a motorist has lived through the experience and awakened in his bed to find it was only a bad dream . Last week London Bus Driver Albert Gunter , 46 , knew that it was no dream . With 20 passengers in his double-decker bus , Albert was just starting across the draw in London 's Tower Bridge , as he had hundreds of times before . Suddenly , he said later , " it seemed as though the roadway in front of me was falling away . " Albert started to jam on his brakes . Then he changed his mind . <P> " Everything happened terribly quickly , " he said . " I realized that the part we were on was rising . It was horrifying . I felt we had to keep on or we might be flung into the river . So I accelerated . " Up and up slowly went the bridge span ; on and on Albert drove his bus . At the end of the span , Albert , his conductor and all 20 passengers soared off into space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thump on the southern span six feet below . " I thought that might start going up too , " said Albert , " so I just kept right on till I got to the other bank . " <P> Results : a broken spring for the bus ; a broken leg for the conductor ; minor injuries for twelve passengers ; a 10 ( $28 ) bonus to Albert for his quick thinking .
