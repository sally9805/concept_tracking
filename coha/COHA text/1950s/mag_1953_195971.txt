In August 1950 , Russian-born Ben Gold , president of the Red-dominated International Fur and Leather Workers Union , publicly renounced his 30-year membership in the Communist Party . Soon after , he signed the non-Communist oath , which the Taft-Hartley Act requires of all labor leaders whose unions want the all-important services of the National Labor Relations Board . Last week a federal grand jury in Washington , convinced by the Justice Department that Gold 's conversion was no more than skin-deep , indicted him on the charge that he had perjured himself by signing the NLRB affidavit . Had the grand jury delayed one more day the statute of limitations would have rendered 55-year-old Ben Gold immune to prosecution .
