HIGH in Oregon 's Cascade Range I watched two fallers set their saw to the base of a proud Douglas fir . Roots in shadow , crown in sun , the great tree thrust up straight and true , a mirror copy of hundreds of its kind crowding that verdant valley . " Ever see a tall tree felled ? " asked the logging boss who stood at my side . " Well , it 's kinda sad , in a way . But , what with defense an ' all , everybody 's beggin ' for wood . " Who would n't feel a pang or two , indeed , watching one of these 300-year-old patriarchs cut off in its prime ! The fallers kept up their rhythmic strokes as the steel teeth steadily undermined the brown column . Suddenly overstrained tree sinews snapped . The saw 's " siss-ss , siss-ss " stopped short . Came the warning cry , " Tim-ber-rr ! " Far up in the sky the green spire tilted , dropping faster every second . " Five , six , seven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the stump . " Eight , nine , ten !

What would happen to that log ? What would happen to the millions of trees felled that year , and next year , and the next ? Seeking the answers proved a fascinating quest . Falling Is Wood 's Birth to New Life Felling and hauling are only the preface to bewildering magic whereby industry transforms Nature 's biggest living things into a fabulous array of things for larger living . ( page 110 ) . Fabricators and technicians now make from wood not just boards , beds , barns , and bookcases , but chemicals , clothing , and plastics ; paper and paperboard cartons ; structural and insulation panels ; fillers , films , and fibers . No wonder that in his lifetime the average American uses the substance of 400 trees ! All of us can reach out almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I picked up my telephone in Washington , D.

Every year we buy about five million pounds of this compound for molding handsets and other parts . " He further advised : " Go look at the telephone switchboard in your office . The switchboard itself is made of wood . Even the little bases of the switchboard lamps are wood . " " Anything else ? " I asked . " Yes , indeed ! " Mr. Stong declared . " Telephone booths , poles , and crossarms used by the Bell System swallow enormous amounts of wood .

Wood , as Shakespeare said of man , plays many parts . Some are " straight " roles : furniture , fuel , and construction lumber ; butcher blocks , toothpicks , tool handles , and rolling pins . But wood also stars in " character " parts . so disguised you 'd never guess its forest origin . Turn up the label on your silky necktie or on your summer dress or suit . There 's a good chance it says " Rayon . " Rayon is made primarily from wood cellulose ( page 137 ) . The phrase " steaks from sawdust " overleaps the steps to achieve that transformation . Yet sawdust can be processed to yield molasses for supplementary cattle feed . This forest-born diet , though successful , so far is experimental in the United States .

He mixes pine shavings and sawdust with clay in making firebricks . In the lava-hot kilns the pine waste burns out . This brick is lighter , and has heat-insulating properties not found in bricks of solid clay . My wife reminded me of an illustrious wooden man .  | " Have you got Charlie McCarthy down there ?

Log levers were the first machines . Tree trunks used for rollers may well have inspired the labor-saving wheel . Wood reduced to charcoal made smelting possible . Wooden ships carried men to conquest of the Seven Seas . The first cargoes the Virginia Company venturers carried back from the New World to England were sassafras bark and pine and cedar logs . Our pioneers rolled west in prairie schooners built of wood . Abundant forests , mighty asset to any nation , have enormously enriched America . One doughty statistician computed that enough saw timber grows in the United States every 9 seconds to build a new home . Yet in productive forests we rank only fourth , after Russia , Brazil , and Canada . The U.S.S.R. boasts timber resources half again as vast as those of the United States and Canada combined . Wood a Mighty War Weapon In World War II our industries based on wood were a bulwark of Allied strength . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from rifle stocks to plywood planes , camp cots to life rafts , tent poles to tugboats . The Parkwood Corporation of Wakefield , Massachusetts , for example , shipped plasticimpregnated , densified wood to the British . They shaped it into propellers for combat planes . Side by side with the Navy 's steel vessels fought hundreds of wooden ships ? minesweepers , PT boats , subchasers , assault and crash  | boats , tenders , mobile dry docks , and many more . Our " five-ocean " Navy mustered more than 49,000 wooden craft ! Builders laid 120,000 board feet of teak to deck each of our largest battleships . ( A board foot is a piece of lumber one foot long , one foot wide , and an inch thick . ) The flight deck of every big Essex-class aircraft carrier was surfaced with two and a third acres of edgegrain Douglas fir three inches thick . Wood Boosted Ersatz Output Shortages " put the squeeze " on Germany to make all possible use of wood . Hitler 's legions ate chocolate candy sweetened with wood sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood chips . Germany used food yeast from wood to fortify cattle fodder . Soldiers mixed the yeast in spaghetti sauces , biscuit dough , and soups , and sprinkled it on salads . German scientists made synthetic tires from alcohol derived from wood . Wood gas drove trucks . Trees yielded lubricants and explosives . Nazi troops wore " wood wool " clothing . The ill wind of war blew good to our peacetime economy in a rich legacy of wood-fabricating techniques . But the Federal Government , colleges , and private research groups still put wood through endless tryouts , seeking new ways to make it serve . Leader in U. S. wood research is the Department of Agriculture 's Forest Products Laboratory at Madison , Wisconsin . There I saw , smelled , and touched wood in every imaginable guise , from sap-scented logs and planks to paper pulp , alcohol , wood-and-resin laminates , and plywood . I threaded a fantastic workshop where intent laboratory men bent , twisted , hammered , boiled , baked , crushed , dissected , squeezed , burned , soaked , dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fireproof annex I watched workers deliberately start a fire ! Within the building they had erected a section of a house , complete with shutters , doors , draperies , rugs , furniture , and pictures . The lifelike " props " assured a realistic experiment . At a signal , trained " firebugs " touched off an over-full wastebasket in the dummy house , just as if a careless guest had tossed in an unextinguished cigarette . I stood with observers who studied external thermometers and recording devices as the blaze spread . Other instruments had been placed within .  | After window glass cracked and flames licked through the wooden walls , a water spray put out the fire . The technicians were studying combustion temperatures of structures , fittings , and furnishings made from wood . This was just one of hundreds of tests under way that day in the Forest Products Laboratory , finest of its kind in the world . Wood " Has Everything " What are the qualities of wood that make it such a favorite ? Wood is made up of countless tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trees ' natural " glue . " This fibrous structure gives great load-bearing strength , as in posts and piling . Parallel to the grain , wood 's resiliency and tensile strength are phenomenal . Think of the beating a diving board takes ! Wood fatigues very slowly , and resists weather and decay like few other organic materials . Most wood shows amazing resistance to shock . Like a good boxer , it " rolls with the punches " ? essential where exposed to repeated impact , as in shuttle blocks and bowling pins . Wood appeals to human senses ; its rich appearance and pleasing hue attract the eye . That 's not all ! Unlike cold-feeling metal , glass , and stone , wood is neutral to the touch , a poor conductor . Many species have pleasant perfumes . Wood is compact and clean , it floats ( most species ) , and is easy to work . It takes stains , paints , and other finishes smoothly . Several dense woods sink like rocks in water . By contrast , feather-light balsa floats like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and model airplanes . Balsa allows clowns to lift " impossible " weights and collapsing " timbers " to leave actors ' heads undented . Two of the best things of all about wood are : it is still generally abundant ; and it 's a renewable resource . Some useful kind of tree will grow on almost any kind of land , save in regions of climatic extremes . United States Is a Wood Workshop " From sea to shining sea " the forest-blessed United States is a giant wood workshop . Our forefathers found a wealth of oak and maple , birch and ash , white pine and spruce in New England , New York , the north-central States , and the southern Appalachians . They built mills that were the nucleus of today 's furniture , implement , and flooring industries .  | Pioneers , some seeking yellow metal , discovered " green gold " in the Northwest and northern California . Today we count heavily on those living riches , our virgin stands of quality softwoods ? Douglas fir , ponderosa pine , redwood , western hemlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedar . These superb species , together with southern yellow pine , form our chief reservoir of construction lumber . Wood sawed from two average Douglas firs will build a typical American home . Much Maine and Minnesota spruce and fir , and the South 's young , fast-growing pines , are unsuitable for long-lumber . They yield newsprint , kraft ( bag and wrapping ) papers , paperboards , and wall- and hard-board products . Trees of the South , seldom thought of as a great forest region , supply 47 percent of the Nation 's pulpwood and 37 percent of its lumber , reports the American Forest Products Industries of Washington , D. C. The timber industries contribute 13 to 14 billion dollars annually to the national income . Turning out wood and wood-derived items worth this fabulous sum are about 60,000 sawmills ( though a scant three percent of them produce more than half our lumber ) , 650 veneer and plywood plants , 325 shingle mills , 200-25.0 pulp mills , and many specialty factories . In 1950 a record-smashing building boom gripped the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 new dwelling units started , including some 200,000 farm homes . And four out of five houses are built of wood . Housing and building by industry consume about half the United States ' saw-timber cut , which is running about 50 billion board feet annually . Builders ordered boards , beams , and trim stock for everything from shingles and porch rails to huge timbers ? linked by steel connector rings ? for roof trusses of factories , gymnasiums , warehouses , hangars , and churches . The lusty cry for lumber has given new life to portable sawmills , nicknamed " peckerwoods , " " popgun mills , " " ground rattlers , " " coffeepots , " and " jeep mills . " h.Homes from the Assembly Line Postwar hunger for low-cost houses has spurred prefabrication and mass production . You can purchase land today and ? with good luck ? move into your new home in about a month . How ? Buy an assemblyline house . About 50 major U. S. manufacturers in 1950 turned out some 55,000 prefabricated homes , basically of wood : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany , Indiana , a leading " prefab " maker , has geared its conveyor-belt production line to turn out a complete house every 20 minutes and several hundred every month . They ship the various house components in packages for assembly on the site . When you write out your down-payment check , you 're assured a finished dwelling , complete to sidewalks , drives , landscaping ? even flowers in the window boxes ! Oil , coal , and gas notwithstanding , even today the third largest use of our timber supply is for fuel . Yes , between a quarter and a fifth of the yearly wood crop goes up in flames ( page 138 ) . Even a modern metropolis like New York City has n't eliminated open fires . New Yorkers still watch flames flicker in 100,000 fireplaces . Two of these , both on the 80th floor of the Empire State Building , are the world 's highest fireplaces above street level . Logs Hold Up Wires , Rails , and Mine Roofs Across our land millions of trees have lost life and limb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are the 86 million telephone , telegraph , and electric-power poles that play follow-the-leader up and down the 48 States . Crews erect 7,000,000 new poles every year . Railroads haul a major portion of the Nation 's wood products and rely heavily on wood to do the job . Hurtling along at 85 miles an hour , the New York Central Railroad 's crack 20th Century Limited flashes past 3,750 wood ties and 90 wood telegraph poles every minute . Speeding trains of America clickety-clack over rails bedded to more than a billion wooden crossties . Although steel and conveyor belts are gradually replacing wood in mines , a huge quantity still is used for pit props , shoring timbers , track ties , and other mine wood . In certain items the wood industry can match the Federal Budget for astronomical figures . Guess how many pencils Americans use each year , to scribble orders to the baby sitter , to keep the Canasta score , and to tot up the income tax ? The answer is one-and-a-half billion ? more than 10 pencils apiece for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw with that staggering number of pencils would reach to the sun and back 283 times . Six-sided or round , most pencils are shaped halves of glued wood gripping the graphiteand-clay " lead . " Fresh from the sharpener ,  | they smell so nice because they 're almost all made of incense cedar . The average incense cedar from northern California yields 57,600 pencils ? 400 gross . Eastern red cedar , mostly from Tennessee , once provided the bulk of our pencil wood . As it grew scarce , pencil people combed the countryside , buying up barns , cedar fences , log cabins , well sweeps , anything made of cedar . Then the western cedar " came in " to save the day ! The limited supply of eastern cedar still is sought for high-quality drawing pencils . Tennessee cedar has a ruddy hue . Incense cedar saws out light tan . Bowing to tradition , pencil makers dye the western wood in the favored rosy shade !

Diamond is the leading producer of all basic match types : wooden safety , wooden " strike anywhere , " and book ( paper ) matches . The company 's production line is as prolific as a bevy of anthill queens ; it turned out 40 percent of the total 1950 national output of 485 billion matches of all kinds . Roughly three out of every five were wooden ( p. 139 ) . In other operations Diamond saws , splits , and stamps hardwoods into chip-size but practical products , among them tongue depressors , meat skewers , floral sticks , forks and spoons , ice cream and candy sticks , clothespins , and toothpicks .

Builders who purchased the scarcely marred wood hauled off lumber enough to erect nearly 85 six-room houses . Inauguration band music set a-quiver old timbers of the White House , now undergoing renovation . Contractors have found many  | White House beams , dating from reconstruction after the 1814 fire , in surprisingly good condition . The venerable White House has sheltered , among others , an honored President who owed quite a debt to wood . He learned his " figgers " by the light of wood-fed flames , using a wooden shovel for a slate ; he split rails and cut posts to fence the land he plowed , and carved out an ox yoke with his own hands . In country towns of Lincoln 's day , cooper and wheelwright were key men in local economy . Every wagon needed wheels , and nothing served so well as a stout barrel for shipping flour , sugar , pickles , or pork . Today , the making of wooden wheels is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buggy wheels , street-cleaning pushcarts , milk wagons , and some farm vehicles . Architects and builders buy a few for chandeliers and garden decorations . The cooper 's craft has fallen victim to specialization . Barrel assembly plants buy the staves and heading from some 400 small independent mills . Despite competition from other packagings , the United States last year made about 30 , - 000,000 kegs and slack barrels ( used to store and transport solids ) . Distillers now own many of the largest factories turning out tight barrels ( which hold liquids ) . For aging whisky they need quantities of barrels made of white oak , which seems to improve the liquor 's flavor . Several plants in Louisville , Kentucky , Memphis , Tennessee , and other cities produce 1,000 to 2,000 barrels daily . First Saboteur a Shoe Tosser Many country folk in Europe still wear wooden shoes , called sabots in France and the Low Countries . By one account , the first saboteur was a malcontent French worker who tossed his sabot into machinery to cause damage . Another explanation draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the willful carelessness of sabotage . English adopted both words ( page 140 ) . Today shoes are made primarily of leather , but shoe lasts on which shoes are built are precisely shaped from choice hardwoods , usually hard maple ( Acer saccharum ) . The foot takes terrific punishment , so care in shoe structure is essential . Manufacturers cut shoe parts from patterns and then build up the finished shoe on a last . Just five U. S. firms turn out all the rough last blocks , first step in shoeing 150,000,000 Americans . The same companies ship lasts by the thousands to foreign shoemakers . Though wooden shoes are generally outdated in this country , Oscar Auestad of Port- land , Oregon , still does a nice business in wood-soled shoes . Employees of cheese factories , ice plants . and in other work where underfooting is slippery find his footwear just the thing . Telephone linemen like them on two scores : they 're good insulators , and they 're so tough that the men can scramble up and down phone poles all day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Campuses of our Northwest colleges provide our biggest market , " Mr. Auestad told me . " Most of the coeds keep a pair of our knockabout low shoes . We call them college woods . ' " Though wood shoes are the exception , most American women walk on wood heels , except for heavier-welt shoes , such as sport styles and low-heeled oxfords . Wood heel makers fashion wedge heels from softwood . For all others they use hard maple , the same tree that yields maple sugar . First Wood Heels Raised Wearers Above Mud Milady parading on Fifth Avenue probably is sublimely unaware that her raised wood heels originally were contrived to elevate the wearers ' feet above mud and filth of medieval streets ! In Marie Antoinette 's day , both nobles and their ladies wore high wood heels . and , in general , the higher their station the higher were their heels . About 50 manufacturers turn out most of the millions of wood heels that give American women their high standing in the world . Foot troops in the Civil War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains .

Holgate Brothers Company won the contract for supplying the armies of the North with those buckets . This woodworking firm . founded in 1789 to turn duster- and hearthbrush handles , today makes a famous line of wooden toys . To help embellish Junior 's Merry Christmas , wooden toys tumble in a bright cascade from ten or a dozen major toy factories . Wood is ideal for toys : it 's easy to saw . turn , sand , and lacquer . Wood toys even tempt the touch . " Keep your hands off the wood and on the keys ! " says the mother promoting her smudgyfingered youngster from a toy piano to the real thing .

This shaping allows the sounding board to vibrate as a whole and throw off more tone . " We build up our grand piano rims of bent maple laminations , " he continued . " All case parts , such as top , desk , and keylid cover , are of laminated wood . Fine mahogany or walnut veneers finish off our instruments . " During the late war Steinway manufactured hundreds of wooden wings for troop-carrying gliders .

Maple and spruce , aged from 25 to 40 years , are preferred for their construction . Finger boards , pegs , and tailpieces are made of black ebony . The pipelike wood winds ? clarinets , oboes , English horn , and bassoons ? are fashioned from wood , most often African blackwood and granadilla . The harp 's frame is spruce or maple , the xylophone 's bars Honduras rosewood . Bass drum and tambourine have shells and hoops of mahogany or maple .

Spalding workers shape their rackets from 8 to 12 sawed laminations of ash . When a powerful tennis player hits a service blow , his racket may bend as much as two and a half inches . Shoulder overlays distribute the resultant severe strains from tip of frame to handle . " In Spalding 's frame-whacking test , " Mr. Tynan told me , " we rotate two rackets at a time at very high speed . A special timing device drops a tennis ball that hits each racket in exactly the right spot as it reaches the top of the arc .

" Bats Give the " Bang " to Baseball One sunny afternoon in 1884 , Bud Hillerich , a young wood turner playing hooky from his father 's shop , was watching a baseball game in the Louisville , Kentucky , ball park . A groan went up as the home-town slugger , Pete Browning , broke his favorite bat . Young Bud persuaded Browning to go to his father 's plant and let the youth try to make a replacement bat . Wielding the new swat stick , Browning next day got " three for three " ? and the Hillerichs were in the bat business !

" We 've made bats to the personal measure of every great star of the past 50 or 60 years . Babe Ruth notched one of our bats 21 times and another 27 times to record the home runs he hit with each . " Hillerich &; Bradsby Co. easily leads the world in baseball and softball bat production . In 1950 the firm turned out more than three million bats . H &; B makes bats from ash and hickory , with ash far ahead in popularity .  | About a tenth of the estimated $48,000,000 worth of fishing tackle ( at manufacturers ' prices ) sold to U.

Ski and Crutch Leadership Is Coincidental Outdoor America is have taken to skiing like jam takes to a small boy 's face . The best wood for skis is hickory from the almost snowless south-central United States . All skimaking countries im port it for their finest models . The New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission , proud of two truths about their State , firmly declared " no connection " between them : ( 1 ) New Hampshire is one of the country 's top ski centers ; and ( 2 ) New Hamp shire produces three quarters of the United States ' output of wooden crutches !

Intricate and pon derous steel structures that carry the huge weight of our industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and airplane plants , as well as shipyards and ordnance works , buy quantities of wood for models , templets , pat terns , and mock-ups . These are as essential to the end products as bolt is to a lock . At the U. S. Naval Gun Factory in Washington , D. C. , chief quarterman E. C. Lynch led me around the patternmakers ' benches . I watched wood workers contour the wood " originals " from which molds are made for casting parts of naval guns , from 40-mm. antiaircraft types to giant 16-inch battleship rifles . Mr. Lynch showed me a 20-foot-high gun director turret , gray-painted like the finished maze of metal . Every bit of that meticulous mock-up was wrought from wood . Gun Factory carpenters made the scale in teriors of battleships that two cars of the Freedom Train carried all over America .

Wood has a conspicuous record in certain bearings , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quiet-turning pulleys of Venetian blinds are cut from lignum vitae , rich in a waxy , lubricating resin . At the other end of the scale this dense tropical wood serves in huge rollneck bearings in steel rolling mills . Shipbuilders still use lignum vitae for main bearings to cradle propeller shafts on many types of vessels . Stern-tube bearings of lignum vitae are preferred for submarines ; their vibrations are less likely to be picked up by detecting equipment than those of metal bearings . Lignum vitae still does service in a wide range of oilless bearings . Most wood bearings , however , are now made from northern hardwoods , mostly maple , impregnated with oil . A man with an artificial leg may give no hint of his handicap , because a self-lubricating wood bearing in the knee joint smooths action of his ersatz limb . Dynamite makers guard against explosions by placing wood bearings in rollers supporting belts moving the inflammable ingredients . Screw conveyors handling sugar , flour , feed , chemicals , and other products susceptible of contamination depend on self-oiled bearings . Wood bearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Life Without Paper ?

The logs were transformed into the bright coated sheets that contribute so much to the appearance of your NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE at the Champion-International Company mill in Lawrence , Massachusetts . Our paper towels , napkins , and disposable tissues have their origin in the forest . Printed papers are our " tickets " on life 's journey . Words on processed wood make our birth official . They form our schoolbooks , movie tickets , driving and marriage licenses , bonds and shares , documents and deeds . Paper carries the printed word that instructs , informs , and entertains all of us . More than 12,000 U.

A single company , Container Corporation of America , shipped 864,000 tons of paper and paperboard containers and cartons in 1950 . CCA leads the paper packaging field . Wood boxes , crates , and baskets , however , still outstrip paper ones for carrying a huge volume of berries , citrus fruits , apples , tomatoes , and winter vegetables .

Workers cut and dry the veneer sheets , then glue and hot-press them together , usually in odd-numbered groups of plies ? three , five , seven . Electrical engineers have contributed a foolproof technique for setting glues . In this so-called " high-frequency gluing " an electric current passes between electrodes embedded in each face of a press . Almost instantaneously the current heats the glue line and firmly bonds adjacent wood surfaces ? the plies of veneer that make up plywood , for example .

Rich Veneers , Furniture 's " Make-up " Furniture makers stress veneer for chests of drawers , tables , cabinets ? pieces displaying broad , clear areas of wood . With expert care they apply thin slices of beautifully patterned wood to exposed surfaces of sturdy , but less costly , core stock . Veneers add that " rich look " not only to furniture but also to radio , record player , and television sets . The Radio Corporation of America , for instance , in 1950 used 23,500,000 square feet of veneers in RCA radio and television cabinets . A tropical wood , mahogany , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as volume cabinet woods , for both solid and veneering uses . Other tropical woods grow increasingly popular , but the totals of all these " newer " exotic species combined do not approach the quantities of walnut and mahogany used . Choice veneering woods , with dense and twisted " picture-making " fibers , have brought sky-scraping prices ; exceptional mahogany logs have sold for as much as $15,000 , walnut stumps for $6,000 . Such precious specimens , of course , are as scarce as early issues of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC . " Despite its long journey from tropical forests , mahogany is not only the most widely used but also the least expensive of major cabinet woods , imported or domestic , " said George N. Lamb , secretary of the Mahogany Association , Inc . " Four-fifths of mahogany veneer sells for less than 3% cents a square foot . Not exactly a jewelry ' wood , is it ? "  | Three-quarters of all household furniture is made of wood , most of it hardwoods , the broad-leaved trees that in temperate latitudes mostly shed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for solid parts of furniture . Workers often apply walnut , maple , and mahogany veneers to gum core stock . " Grand Rapids " Means Quality Furniture In the trade , " Grand Rapids quality " means high-grade furniture , wherever made . Grand Rapids , Michigan , has become , of course , virtually synonymous with furniture . But there are many other centers of the industry , among them New York , Chicago , and Los Angeles ; High Point , North Carolina ; Rockford , Illinois ; Evansville , Indiana ; Jamestown , New York ; Gardner , Massachusetts ; and Sheboygan , Wisconsin . In Washington , D. C. , I visited the laboratory of the Timber Engineering Company , a commercial wood-products testing firm affiliated with the National Lumber Manufacturers Association . Joe Stearns of TECO 's research staff was sitting on an office desk talk- ing to me about ' the laboratory 's current projects . Stearns casually laid down a freshly lit cigarette on the gleaming desk to pick up a sample laminated bowling pin . " Watch that cigarette ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , it wo n't , " Mr. Stearns calmly stated . " There 's a thin sheet of aluminum foil bonded under the wood veneer of this desk top . The aluminum carries the 700 to 1,200-degree heat away so fast from the burning cigarette that the wood never gets hot enough even to scorch . " One of several office furniture makers now featuring these TECO-developed desk tops is the Myrtle Desk Company of High Point , North Carolina . They sand down walnut desk-top veneers of their Pacemaker line to bring the heat-drawing aluminum sheet as close as possible to the surface . A burn-proof varnish finishes off the job . When the chemist in industry breaks down wood into cellulose and lignin , he 's releasing  | key raw materials . Wood is approximately one-half cellulose and one-third lignin . Lignin provides tannins and vanillin , and holds promise as an industrial chemical source . Lignin also is a base for hard , waterproof plastics , the stuff of radio cabinets , kitchen utensils , electrical equipment , combs and brush backs . From Cellulose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present is cellulose . Cotton linters still are a source of the cellulose used as a chemical raw material , but four-fifths of our supply comes from trees . Hemlocks of the Northwest yield about 90 percent of wood-derived chemical cellulose . In one major use , technicians treat cellulose chemically to provide a syrupy liquid they force through tiny holes into a special bath . There fine filaments form and harden into viscose rayon , one of our basic textile fibers . Cellulose also is the raw material of acetate and cuprammonium rayon . Mills weave rayon into all kinds of fabrics , from dress goods and underclothing to conveyor-belt materials and cord to strengthen auto tires . Three-fourths of the cellulose used in rayon last year came from wood pulp . Photographic film , alike for Hollywood 's costly motion picture cameras and for your inexpensive snapshot box , is made of cellulose acetate ? so-called " safety film " ? or from cellulose nitrate . Cellulose also is a base for plastics , including well-known celluloid . Cellophane , glassine , and greaseproof papers spring from cellulose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foods , blankets , lampshades , and hundreds of other items . World-renowned E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Company of Wilmington , Delaware , uses enormous quantities of cellulose as a raw material in its ramified operations . Six Du Pont departments make more than a dozen products based on this versatile material , officers of the firm told me . Cellulose enters into Du Pont rayon , detergents and sizes for textiles , pyroxylin-coated  | fabrics for bookbinding and upholstery , nitrocellulose lacquers , and household cement . It provides the stuff of Du Pont photographic film , smokeless powder , cellophane , cellulose sponges , and plastics ( page 134 ) . " Waste " a Challenge to Wood Users Abundance of wood has made our people lavish in its use ? and heedless , too . Every year we wastefully or extravagantly dispose of well over 100 million tons of wood , much of it burned as fuel for lack of better use ( page 114 ) . About half this appalling loss occurs in the woods and half in processing . Every singing saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sawdust for each board it rips free . The U. S. Forest Service states that only 43 percent of all the wood handled yearly in this country goes into merchantable products other than fuel . Twenty-two percent is burned as fuel , including much of the inescapable waste in wood manufactures . Thirty-five percent is not used at all . Yet in developing the know-how to achieve total utilization of wood , men already have bettered the butcher 's boast of using all the pig but the squeal . Modern wood magicians can now use all the tree , including the bark ! Dozens of uses have been found for bark . George M. Hunt , until recently director of the Forest Products Laboratory , showed me big wood panels edge-glued together from small strips . He told me such stock-fromscraps has high priority these days . Fabricators keep a weather eye cocked toward the insulation , and hard boards are using former " wastes " ? sawdust , slabs , chips , ends , and so forth ? as raw material . Exploded Chips Yield Dense Panel Pioneer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Masonite explosion process technicians subject wood flakes to steam under pressure . When they release the pressure , the chips literally explode into fiber . Compressed under heat , this pulplike substance becomes dense , smooth-surfaced fiber hardboard adapted to  | any number of structural uses in home and industry . Masonite 's parent plant at Laurel , Mississippi , " still turns out far more hardboard than any other single factory in the world . The Puget Sound Pulp &; Timber Co. of Bellingham , Washington , was among the first to make alcohol on a commercial basis from pulp mill waste liquors . The firm distills approximately three million gallons of 190-proof ethyl alcohol every year from fluids formerly discharged through sewers . Weyerhaeuser Shows the Way America 's largest single lumber producer is the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company , with headquarters in Tacoma , Washington . The company seal bears the wise motto , " Timber Is a Crop . " Weyerhaeuser 's saw- , box , and pulp mills dot Washington and Oregon . At Longview , Washington , they run a huge plywood plant . Weyerhaeuser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 2,000,000 acres of tree farms . But the company has invested fortunes to develop ways and means of using not only the clear hearts of big saw logs , but every scrap of wood hauled out of the forest . Leftovers and by-products from one mill frequently become raw material for another . The company makes , for example , a fistful of products from Douglas fir bark , the " useless " 12 percent of a log . They market the bark , under the name Silvacon , as a plywood glue extender and as an ingredient in insecticides , plastics , and soil conditioners . Silvacon blended with special cement makes a trowel-laid flooring almost as quiet and resilient as linoleum or rubber . It takes a slick polish like terrazzo . In a House-That-Jack-Built routine , Weyerhaeuser 's shrewd operators also recover chemical by-products from " unwanted " liquid effluents of their Longview sulphite mill . They burn solids concentrated from these waste liquors to give power to help run the mill . Then they convert char from the boiler furnaces to chemicals used over again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the char that makes the chemicals that ... !  | Round and round goes this " cyclic recovery process . " Since the recent war , wood has played a proud part in restoring normal relations between countries . Millions of board feet of North American lumber are helping rebuild Europe . A heart-warming story of wood 's role in making friends across the oceans concerns two tornadoes that swept paths of destruction 23 years and 4,700 miles apart . On August 10 , 1925 , a freak tornado devastated little Borculo in the Netherlands . Generous gifts from the United States helped rebuild the town 's two furniture plants . A generation later , on January 3 , 1949 , " a big black cloud with a red funnel " lashed the sawmill town of Warren , Arkansas . The tornado wiped out 300 homes and destroyed the large Bradley Lumber Company mill . Word of the disaster reached Borculo . City fathers , remembering American aid in the tragic days of 1925 , backed a drive to send a gift of furniture to stricken Warren . Merchants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other ingredients from which Borculo women baked thousands of cookies and doughnuts . Volunteers sold the delicacies from door to door . Entertainers raised additional funds . The proceeds paid for 40 black oak armchairs , four conference tables , four round tip-top tables , a hand-carved chest , and a chandelier , all from Borculo . On behalf of the people of the Dutch town , Netherlands Ambassador E. N. van Kleffens presented the gifts to Warren , Arkansas , on December 8 , 1949.  |
