txt CAIRO , Aug. ** a blunt statement to the independent newspaper Al Ahram , Maj. Gen. Mohammed Naguib , Commander in Chief of the Egyptian armed forces , took the nation 's political parties severely to task today for their conduct since the change of regime . He intimated that if the parties failed to purge their own ranks of corrupt elements they would be purged by force . He said : " We have advised . Now we warn . Next we shall act . We have had enough of corruption . Political parties must get rid of bad elements . The next step should be to bring these bad elements to book and let ? justice take its course . " We have noticed that the statements of policy issued by the parties are identical . There is , therefore , no point in having so many parties . The only difference between one party and another is the people in them . Our parties are founded on personalities , not on principles . This is peculiar to Egypt . " General Naguib said yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political party , in dismissing fourteen members of its parliamentary group , including three former Cabinet ministers , was mere window dressing and that the committee set up to investigate allegations against other members of the group was composed of people who should themselves be investigated . Premier Adds to Warning Premier My Maher , in a broadcast to the nation tonight , asked the Egyptian people to give their unqualified support to the present regime in its ? efforts to achieve universal reforin under the banner of freedom , justice and equality . Making his first comprehensive statement on the Government 's internal policy , the Premier first praised the army , which , he said , had struck a magnificent blow at corruption and tyranny and achieved a resounding success with unprecedented speed . After listing the evils of party politics as they had developed in Egypt over the last twenty-five years ail addressing himself directly to the country 's political leaders , the Premier enjoined them to " explain to the people that the political parties , as at present constituted and managed , are foredoomed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reshaped and reformed or disrupt and disappear . " Indispensable reforms would have to be based on the idea that the parties belonged to the nation and not to individuals , that they were dedicated to the definite and specific principles that differentiated them and that they o and no longer escape democratic maiagement and control . Weakness and Confusion The Premier accused the old sysem of having failed to produce a generation of public men equal to their various tasks with the result that the independence of Egypt had not been completely secured , and foreign troops were still on Egyptian soil . The Premier also accused successive Parliaments of dereliction , as they had not protected the country from corruption and despotism , but instead had turned the Constitution into a source of weakness and confusion . The Premier announced the immediate abolition of press censorship and promised to provide the public with as much information as possible . It was believed that the Council // of State , Egypt 's highest legal body , had been consulted as to , whether the Constitution could be ' amended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law could also be amended . In this connection , General Naguib was asked today whether he favored holding elections in the near future inasmuch as the new regime was without a formal man-dat fi ? in the people . The general replied that this was a question for the Government to decide , the implication being that he himself had no strong feelings in the matter , one way or the other . Asked if the army would have any objection in principle if the Constitution or the electoral law , or both , were amended by decree , General Naguib replied : " If the Government sees that such amendments are in the interest of the country there is no reason why I should object . " General Naguib declined to say whether the new regime intended to make a formal request to the United States for military aid or whether it was prepared to accept the conditions upon which such aid is provided to other countries . He simply stated that the Egyptian Army would be glad to receive arms equipment from the United States . Other questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it would be reasonably or politically posIsible for the United States to ' extend military aid to Egypt so long as Egypt is technically at war with Israel ? Answer  --  Why not ! We shall not use arms for aggression . Question  --  Is there in your view any apriori objection to participation by Egypt in some sort of joint planning group such as the one now proposed by the British Government ? Answer  --  This is not considered for the time being . Internal reforms are our first concern . Question  --  Do you feel that there would be any objection to a change in the balance of power among the , Arab states resulting from the fusion of two or more states  --  Iraq and . Jordan , for example ? Answer  --  If such fusion should ' take place it should happen without any pressure from one country or another . Last Monday the Wafd executive convened in Alexandria with former Premier Mustafa Nahas in the chair and proceeded to exclude fourteen members of the Wafdist parliamentary group , including three former ministers . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , and none was among the party bigwigs.
