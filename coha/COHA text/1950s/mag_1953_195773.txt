Even among white families eager to give lip service to racial equality , the prospect of having a Negro move into the house next door will often bring qualms about declining property values and a panicky urge to sell out fast . Last week one group of Philadelphia families fought back in a novel way against sellout fever . <P> Early last year a few Negroes began to move into an all-white section of Philadelphia 's East Germantown . A number of other houses in the district promptly went up for sale . Real-estate brokers-many of them Negroes-moved en masse into the general area , asking white families to list their homes . When some white families refused to give listings , the brokers could n't believe that they wanted to stay where they were . <P> Finally , eight white and four Negro families got together and started distributing signs to their neighbors , stating : THIS HOUSE IS NOT FOR SALE . Attached to the sign was a letter : " We like this neighborhood . . . Constant pressure from real-estate brokers is annoying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families are still under the mistaken impression that a community or block must remain all white or ' go all colored ' and that property values decline when colored families move in ... Values do not decline except during panic selling . " <P> Few of the 400-odd signs distributed in the neighborhood were posted . But leaders of the sign project were undismayed , felt it was too early to assess the impact their idea . In the meantime , their experiment could stand by itself as a primer lesson in both democracy and economics .
