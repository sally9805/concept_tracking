txt A large number of members possibly several hundred ? of the American Society for the Prevention of . Cruelty to Animals have resigned recently in protest against the new Metcalf-Hatch Act , which requires the agency and other publicly aided pounds to turn over stray dogs and cats for approved medical research projects . The A. S. P. C. A. has 12,000 members and contributors who pay dues of $5 to $1,000 . Both the society and the city 's Department of Health , which will administer the regulations here , feel the resignations are the result , of a misunderstanding of the law . Signed last month by Governor Dewey after it had stirred more controversy than any other pro posal before the recent session of I the State Legislature , the act goes into effect on July 1 . Some opponents of the law are believed to be under the " erroneous impression " that the A. S. P. C. A. also must send to the laboratories pets brought in by owners who want them put to death quickly and painlessly by gas . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pets to private veterinarians rather than to the society . Warren MeSpadden , general manager of the . A. S. P. C. A. , stressed yesterday that only " unlicensed , unclaimed and unwanted " animals held by the pound for five days could be requisitioned by laboratories approved by the State Department of Health . The use of // animals for medical research , he also pointed out , has long been allowed by law . The new regulations simply change the source from which animals may be requisitioned , he said . Up to the present , most of the animals used in laboratories have been bought directly from pet 1 owners , from persons who raise ' animals for research purposes , or ' from professional dealers who pick up " strays " in other states . Medical authorities contended that not enough animals could be obtained through these channels . " The A. S. P. C. A. , " Mr. said , " is required to operate under the provisions of the new law , and we are throwing every possible protection around every animal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law is lived up to . " The society has been in operation eighty-seven years today . We 've gone through many ups and downs during this time . The present crisis is deep-rooted , but we think everything will turn out all right . But the A. S. P. C. A. and animals need friends now as never before . We hope and trust that the situation will be understood by people everywhere . " Dr. Ralph S. Muckenfuss , Assistant Commissioner of Health , in concurring with Mr. 's statement that animals would be protected in every way possible , commented that the Department of Health " will not only live up to the letter of the law , but we will go along with the spirit of the law . " " We do n't want to see any dogs cruelly treated or abused , " he declared . " We will do everything in our power to see to it that the animals are treated with every kindness and with no avoidable discomfort " The city 's Health Department and the A. S. P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of a program to set ? up an advisory committee of approximately nine members representing the society , the public and the medical schools . The committee 's function will be to advise the Health Department on the portion of the law that the agency will administer here . The department is to act as the agency that will requisition animals for laboratories approved by the state ; it also will approve the fee to be charged by the A. S. P. C. A. for the care of animals while they are being held in the pound prior to requisitioning . This fee has not yet been I determined . In addition , if complaints are received that animals are being abused in laboratories , the committee will advise the Health Department and investigations will be conducted . " The formulation of the committee , " Dr. Muckenfuss said , " is only one indication that the Health Department as well as the A. S. P. C. A. is interested in humane treatment for animals . We 're both working to meet that end . " Mr. vigorously denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society for medical research would run into five figures a year . He estimated that the society would make available annually not more than 4,000 to 5,000 dogs and " a very small number of cats . " He cited the agency 's statistics of last year to emphasize his point . Both Mr. and Dr. Muckenfuss said they had no idea how many animals had been used by laboratories for research . The state Department of Health is circulating a questionnaire among research institutions to determine their actual needs .
