contended that it is by an ill-fitted thumb that even the best dressers often reveal the inadequacy of their costume . And as for food , Dumas simply never got over his concern for it . When , overnight , as an unknown , he suddenly had a hit play in Paris and a ticket broker appeared on his doorstep the next morning and offered to advance him a goodly sum for all the tickets that accrue to the author of a play in production , what did Dumas do with this first chunk of money ever to land in his hands ? Why , he ran out to a neighboring restaurant and arranged for a lump payment to have all his meals free there for a whole year . Imagine ! A whole year in which he need not worry about food ! What bliss ! No man who has not repeatedly suffered the pangs of hunger would behave that way . And what did that restaurant do ? Naturally it went bankrupt before a month had passed . What did Dumas do ? He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth where thieves break in and steal and moths and rust do corrupt . " But all his life he remained preoccupied with the question of food . His only real hobby was cooking . And the last book of his life  --  almost his testament , you might say  --  was his Grand Dictionary of Cooking , the result of a lifetime of recipe gathering . His bird-sized mother , whose waist was not as large around as her husband 's calf , could have no conception of the amount of food her youngster craved . She took her poverty as a sign from God that she had sinned the sin of pride , and that she had had no business to meddle with history . And she was firmly determined that her son should be a violinist and be as far removed as possible from the course of history . But how could one keep history from Alexandre ? Again and again invaders threatened France , and the frightened villagers buried their treasures and ran . From a hide-out in a garret , young Alexandre saw a clash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death before his eyes . Peeping through dusty shutters , he saw Cossacks galloping down the road on the way to occupy Paris.  |p101He  saw the Royalists rejoice when the Bourbons came back to the throne of France , and he saw them become turncoats again when Napoleon escaped from Elba and made his hundred-day comeback . Through the summer heat of 1815 , along the hot and dusty road through Villers-Cotterets , he saw the reconstituted Grande Armee marching . For three whole days they passed : foot soldiers , gaitered giants , with sunburned faces , plaited sidelocks and fierce mustaches . For three whole days they came , accompanied by the constant sound of drumming and interspersed with over a hundred regimentalbands , so that the music of the last one faded into the distanceonly to have its melody taken up by another band appearing on the horizon . The standards of a hundred victories were held aloft , protected in leather casings . Detachments of cavalry went flashing by , their gay colors revealingtheir different organizations : hussars , cuirassiers , dragoons , mamelukes . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains , the swearing cannoneers lashing at the beasts of their heavy caissons . And alongside went the sutlers with their ambulatory refreshment stands , from which the vivandieres rushed with food and drink , in and out of the ranks of men . What a sight it was , this three-day circus ! Even those mothers who execrated the name of Napoleon as the murderer of Frenchmenwere drawn into the growing crowd of admirers . Napoleon himself had said that never in the world 's history had there been such an army as his . " Even the old Romans did not march their men more than twenty-five miles a day . I march mine thirty-five . And my men think nothing of it . The Romans rested their troops for a day before they went into battle . My men march and fight the same day . And never was victory so certain ! " As the cries of Vive l'Empereur ! grew in volume from the onlookerslining the road , Madame Dumas warned her son . " Do n't you dare cheer that man . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear the rags you do because of him . " And she forced him to go to the rear of the store and practice his violin . But she could n't keep him there . He escaped to mingle with the crowd along the road . In spite of himself his throat was thick with pride . In spite of himself his heart was gorged with emotion.  |p102He  ached to cry out " Vive l'Empereurl " But he bit down on his lip . As the procession came to an end , a fast carriage rattled into the courtyard of the Boule d'Or , inn of the Golden Ball , where grooms changed the four horses with mad speed . A crush of people milled about . Alexandre pushed his way through . He could see into the interior , where a pale man sat deep in the cushions . " Vive l'Empereurl " the crowd cried . The pale man inclined his head in graceful acknowledgment . Only Alexandre remained silent , staring . The poet Heine had written a whole paragraph on the beauty and majesty of nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of Napoleon one could see a gold star shining in the sky in broad daylight . " His face , " he said , " has a hue the like of which has to be sought in the marble busts of Greece and Rome . His features are more nobly proportioned than even the best that antiquity can show us . His expression is so imperial that it is like a commandment : Thou shalt have no other gods before me . ' " Alexandre 's heart swelled within his chest . His mouth had to open . His throat had to speak . Carried away in spite of himself , he suddenly brayed , " Vive l'Empereurl " And tears burst from his eyes . The pale head nodded and smiled upon the ragged boy . Then came the rains of late June , and one day a mud-spattered carriage dashed at breakneck speed through the village , stopped abruptly at the inn and changed horses even faster than before . Going out , the Emperor 's carriage had been last . This time it was first . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterloohad already reached the village , and the turncoats were once more busy suiting their apparel to the new political weather . And it was only by chance that Dumas happened to be around and to glimpse in the interior of the carriage the figure of Napoleon , his head more like a marble mask than ever , his body sunk deeper into the cushions . All alone the boy cried , " Vive l'Empereurl " The grooms stared . The man in the carriage gave no sign that he had heard . And afterward , for days , came the march of tired men . No bands played , no drums beat . Only scattered groups of men wan/drred by , many with bloody bandages , some pushing wheelbarrows in which were the severely wounded . All moved slowly toward Paris . It was the funeral procession of an empire . And filtering rapidly through these unresisting men came the hard-riding Poles . Then the Hanoverian light cavalry . And finally the solid marching British . How was it that a man so hated enjoyed such an ascendancy over Frenchmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Turned it from a chore into an adventure ? Which is precisely what Dumas would do later with his plays and books . Fraudulent ? Of course it was fraudulent . As fraudulent as Scanderbeg'sBlack Eagle of Epirus and Albania with its four crosses and its clusters of oak leaves . Napoleon , too , was to be sent back to prison to finish out an unexpired term for pickpocketing the thrones of Europe . Fraudulent , yes . But , God , how it dazzled ! Madame Dumas thought of history only in the terms that the great preacher Bossuet taught in his sermons  --  namely , that it was God 's way of punishing and rewarding us . She had no conception of history as a kind of intoxication , a pageant and a dance peculiar to only one creature on earth  --  namely , man . She was determined to force her boy out of the current of history by making him a violinist , and to that purpose she scrimped and she saved , even out of their own food , that she might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daily lessons . That matter being taken care of , she was left with only one problem : how to get the boy to practice . Here , after trying every idea of her own , and every suggestion of friend and relative , she was reconciled at last to the necessity of beating her own flesh and blood . After a couple of years of lessons , Master Hiraux came one day to Madame Dumas with tears in his eyes . " Believe me , Madame , " he cried , " please believe me . " " Calm yourself , my dear Master Hiraux . " " I have tried and I have tried , good God , how I have tried . And no one knows better than you , Madame , how bitterly I need these three francs which you give me every week . But it is a crime . No , itp104is worse than a crime  --  it is a sin  --  to take from you what you need just as badly as I do . You will never make a violinist out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madame cried , as with one little hand she caught Alexandre , who was about to run out of the door , " we must n't give up so easily . I will punish him from now on twice as hard . You will see . He will be good . He must be good . " " Look , Madame . You see this bow that Alexandre uses ? You see all these repairs ? You see the gluing I have done ? The tiny brass nails I have put in ? The fine wire I have wrapped around ? This is the fifth bow he is in the process of destroying . It is I who do all this repairing . It is I who do the replacing when the bow is too far gone . Why do I do all this , Madame ? For the sake of those miserablethree francs , and for nothing else ! " " How can he destroy so many bows ? " " Madame . Listen to me . On the way to his lesson , he stops to play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a gun . It is a spear . It is an arrow . It is a sword ! He duels with it ! He attacks , he parries , he ripostes ! He does everything with it . That is , he does everything but play the violin with it . Please , Madame , do not tempt me any longer with your three francs . Let me die in peace with a clear conscience ! " And with that the poor man put on his hat and rushed out of the house . Madame Dumas turned upon her son . " Stop it ! " she cried . " Stop it at once ! " " Stop what , Maman ? I 'm not doing anything . " " You 're looking like your father , that 's what you 're doing ! " " Like my father ? " " Yes . And at this particular moment , when I 'm obliged to give you the beating of your life , it is cruel of you to look so much like your father . " " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then at least turn your head away and do n't break my heart . " So Alexandre turned his head away , and his mother 's ineffectual little hand came down on him as hard as she could manage it . " Duels ! Swords ! Guns ! " she cried in exasperation as she rained blow after blow upon him.  |p105Her  energy was not great and was soon spent . " Mais voyons , " she said , utterly out of breath , " are n't you going to cry finally , so that I can stop ? Have you no pity for me ? " " But , Mother , " the boy protested , " you know very well that I ca n't cry unless I see you cry first . " Thus , as always , her beatings ended with the two weeping in each other 's arms . " Oh , what is to become of us ? " Madame Dumas asked and hid her face in her hands . And then , in a habit that was becoming more and more frequent , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneel at her side , and both would pray until illuminationcame to her . Lumiere was what she wanted , and Dumas would recall later how long it would sometimes take for that little light to come . But finally she got it . " It 's poor Master Hiraux whom we must pity , " so the light informedher . " We have tried his patience . And we have cost him the three francs he needs so badly . Obviously there is only one thing to do . You must practice hard , my dear child , and go and beg his pardon and convince him that this time you have reformed . " Alexandre 's face fell . " Oh , no , Mother ! " he cried . " And I say yes , " said Madame Dumas . " I tell you it is God 's will . It is God 's answer to my prayer . So now you will practice , practice and practice , until you can return to Master Hiraux and positively astonish him . " How could she imagine that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could pass the gunsmith 's shop and look through the open doorway and see hanging on the wall the swords , the pistols , the guns that had belonged to his father , and which from time to time would diminish in number as they were sold off ? The owner , a man whose underlip hung like an open purse because a sword cut had severed the nerve there , and which perpetuallydripped saliva , would take pity on the lad and invite him into the shop , show him how to hold an epee , show him how to fire a flintlock , teach him how to meet the recoil , how to hold a gun when climbing over a fence , so as not to discharge the gun into one 's leg or groin ( the way poor Philippe had done , dying , as a result , ofP06lockjaw ) , how to keep powder dry even in wet weather , how to prevent a flash in the pan . Alexandre would take these lessons with an expression of wonderand gratitude that was almost painful to behold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetually glistening with a drop about to fall , was a man he ever afterward remembered with gratitude . How could his mother imagine that she would make a violinist out of Alexandre when every day he had only to get up at dawn and run off into the forest of the old royal preserve and hide there all day long ? At night she might beat him and force him to cry , but she could n't force him to play , for she begrudged the cost of the two candles that had to be put in the double brackets of the music stand , which was the reason , of course , he waited until dark to come home . Being out in all kinds of weather inured him to the cold , the rain and the snow . His health was ever after such that in all his life he scarcely knew what it was to be sick . But of course it also roused still further his formidable appetite and made his craving for food all the keener . How could she make a violinist out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and study better methods of setting snares for leverets , better ways of liming twigs above ponds where birds came to drink , so that the silly creatures would get themselves glued up and their necks could be twisted without trouble ? How could she make a violinist out of him when he was deeply involved in learning how to set mirrors for larks and traps for squirrels ? He was growing every day sharper in ways of evading the forest guards . For example , he figured out that if he now and then showed the guards a trap he had himself secretly placed , he would give himself a reputation for honesty and of being on the guard 's side , so that they would trust him instead of suspecting and spying on him . There were other poachers in the huge forest , and sometimes he would come upon them . He made friends with them . But generally he hunted alone . It was safer . But it was from these poachers that he learned many of his tricks . For example , they taught him how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus wringing from the poor creature such cries that all the birds for a mile around would flock to the scene for the sport of pecking to death a jay thatP107was no longer able to defend itself . Nothing more was needed then but the art of casting a net over the stupid and vindictive little birds . Years later when he read Fenimore Cooper 's Leatherstocking Tales , he recognized himself . He was an Indian . He was a coureur de bois . Years later , too , when he wrote of his hunting exploits in Russia and Africa and Switzerland , there were people who were quick to point out that Dumas was n't a hunter at all . He was never anythingbut a poacher . He shot a rabbit that was n't even running . He shot a partridge on the ground instead of waiting until it was on the wing as a real sportsman would . Indeed , Dumas never really shot anything except with the thought of eating it . And that , of course , is n't hunting at all . At that rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good gun , a pack of dogs , beaters and a fine-tailored hunting habit with a red coat could call themselves hunters , and then the whole noble sport would be degraded . No , Dumas always had food in mind . Indeed , he would no sooner have twelve little birds on a spit than he would set the thing to roast and would pull a piece of bread from his pocket to catch every drop of fat as it fell from the tiny carcasses , and his stomach was so greedy that often he could not wait until the birds were properly done before he was crunching into their tiny bones . And nothing but the thought of his mother , dining at home on yesterday 's reheated potage , would intervene to spoil his total enjoyment . One day he dared come home with a fresh-caught leveret . His mother was occupied in front , in the store . Quickly he skinned the animal and set it to roast . When his mother came from the store , she smelled the meat at once . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leveret , " he said carelessly and blew on the charcoal . " A leveret ? And where did you get a leveret ? " " Found it . " " Found it ? Where ? " " just lying there . " " Dead ? " He nodded .   " Too bad , " she said dryly . " Otherwise one might eat it . " " But why not , Mother ? That 's exactly what we 're going to do . " " Not a rabbit that you found like that . Never . Goodness knows what it died of . A disease perhaps . Or from eating some poison . It must be thrown away . " " But , Mother , I know how it died . " " Oh ? " " Yes . I found it caught in a snare . " " If you found it in a snare , why did n't you run and tell the forest guards ? They would have hidden near by and surprised the poacher when he came to get his catch . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only ... " " Only what ? Was n't it your duty to tell them ? " " Certainly , Mother . Only the poacher they would have caught  --  would have been me . " " You ? " " Yes , Mother , and now our rabbit is ready , " he said , and indeed the odor spread by the fat , crusty meat was divine . But as he was about to take it from the spit , his mother stopped him . " It needs a few more turns , " she said , and , considering how many roasts she had made as daughter of an innkeeper , she was undoubtedlyright . " When it is done you can carry it right over to the forest guards . " " But , Mother , " cried Alexandre , " what can they possibly want with a dead rabbit ? Except to eat it , as we can do by ourselves just as well as they can . " Poor Madame Dumas , trapped in these conflicting arguments , knelt in prayer with her son and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dumas later said , " I rather think it was not so much a light that struck her eyes , or her spirit , as it was an odor , an irresistible odor , that struck her nostrils . At any rate , after her prayers , and after my promise never to poach again , we sat down and ate . " The little larks and finches were less of a problem since they could not be considered as poached , there being no laws to protect songbirdsat that time . But it took such a lot of them to make a proper meal , and this meant a lot of liming of twigs , a lot of mirrors for larks , and in particular a lot of plucked jays . " Plucking a jay is no doubt inhuman , " Dumas confessed years later , " but , good Lord , itP109certainly saved me from many a beating from my dear , kind mother , who wanted so desperately to do the right thing for me , and those beatings hurt me chiefly because I knew then without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One time in the forest , as he was setting snares , he was suddenly surprised by a witch crashing in on him through the underbrush . He was ready to run at the sight of this frightening apparition , a wizened beldam in a black cloak with a mass of false hair protrudingfrom a bonnet that was all awry , but he heard her say , " If we are both frightened of each other , little boy , then neither of us has any reason for fright . " This struck Alexandre as a very sound observation , and instead of running he went up to her . " I am lost , " she said . " I left my carriage on the road for a stroll in the woods . I lost my sense of direction . Then I thought I heard ghosts , and I began to run . " " Ghosts ? " the boy asked . " Real ghosts ? " " Naturally not , " said the woman sharply . " There are no real ghosts . " " Then why were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in ghosts to be afraid of them , " the woman said . This again struck Alexandre as a sound observation , for he knew that though he too did n't believe in ghosts he was afraid to cross the churchyard alone at night . As Alexandre led her through the forest , whose every path he knew by heart , toward the road , the old woman asked him his name . When he told her , she stopped and looked at him . " Then you are the son of the General . " " Yes , Madame . " " I know you through my daughter , who is Madame Collard , and who lives here in Villers-Cotterets , " she said . " But you do not know me , do you ? " " No , Madame . " She told him that her name was Madame de Geniis , and since that also meant nothing to him , she explained to him that she was famous for having laid down the rules of how a prince was to be educated . P110This excited Alexandre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince . " You 're not a prince , " she said to him . " But you 'd like to be , would n't you ? And sometimes you like to imagine that you are a prince , do n't you ? You dream of it . " " Yes , " he admitted . " Well , it 's not easy to be a prince . I made the princes in my care wear iron shoes all day long , so that every step they took would be exercise , and they would n't have to take time away from their other work in order to grow up strong . From the moment they woke up at five o'clock in the morning , they studied . I made them raise their own food in the garden and milk their own goats . And while they worked , they had instructors teaching them botany , mineralogy , astronomy in different languages . In the morning everything was in German . In the afternoon , with music study and painting , everything was in Italian . At mealtimes no language was permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they were not permitted a real bed , just a board of wood and a single light cover  --  we had magic-lantern slides to teach them the history and geography of the world . " " What 's a magic-lantern slide ? " Alexandre wanted to know . Madame de Genlis laughed . " You have a lot to learn , " she said . By this time they had reached the road and her carriage , and Madame de Genlis got in . " It 's not easy to be a prince , is it ? But you 're going to try , are n't you ? " " Oui , Madame , " he said . " Well , maybe you 'll be a prince , " she said and she patted the boy on his head . Dumas never forgot this incident . For a long time his mind dwelt on the possibilities of being a prince . One day his mother told him of how she had made for him a pair of iron shoes when he was three years old , hoping that the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes ? " he exclaimed . " Certainly , " she said . " But they did you no good , and besides they hurt you , so I discarded them . " " I really wore iron shoes . . . " he said , and his face with itsp111shiny olive complexion glowed so that his mother asked him whether he was ill . His mind was on fire with the thought that maybe he was a real prince , maybe he would someday live in a palace , and his mother would be a queen . WHAT ARE CHILDREN if not dreams ? They are conceived amidst thedreams of their parents , and nursed by the dreams of their mothers , and then surrendered to their own dreams . And thus passing from dream to dream , they are gradually ushered into a world that is itself half a dream . And half a nightmare . But the point of this story of the encounter with the witch is that , years later , as a young man , Alexandre was to have a job as envelope-addressingclerk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those princes educated by Madame de Geniis to wear iron shoes and to grow and grind his own grain and to sleep on a plank . And this Duke of Orleans was still later to become King of France at about the same time that Dumas was to rise to the height of his fame and to become known as the " uncrowned king of Paris . " Now as to the respective merits of these two kings , one with a throne of power and the other with a throne of popularity , there is this to be said : Everyone agrees that the Duke of Orleans , who became king under the name Louis Philippe , was so miserly that though he earned out of his private fortune every fifteen minuteswhat a moderately prosperous family would consider a year 's income , he wrecked the French treasury with his demands for more money , even while in Lyons starving silk workers were rioting for bread . Still , one day this crowned king complained to his minister Monsieur de Montalivet that being a king was often a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to death .   " It would be simple , Sire , " said De Montalivet , " to change Versaillesfrom a place where one dies of boredom to a place where one dies laughing . " " That 's something I should like to know about , " the King said . " Alexandre Dumas , " the minister explained , " has failed to report for his two weeks of National Guard Duty . Order him to report here and serve those two weeks in Versailles . You will see that Versailles will become the liveliest place in France . " " No doubt , " said the King dryly . The idea of calling his former envelope-addressing clerk to rejuvenate Versailles did not appeal to him . " Have you heard , Sire , how he keeps a Holy Water fount in the vestibule of his home at Saint-Germain , and how he has his publishersfill it with silver , and how he has a sign there saying , A blessing for those in need . And have you heard how a man came to him ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the King in such a cold voice that the laughter and the words died suddenly in the minister 's throat . In the end , of course , both men lost their thrones . A revolution threw out Louis Philippe . And the slanders of Eugene de Mirecourt eventually undermined Dumas . But I rather think that justice will in the end give the prize to the uncrowned prince , Dumas . Madame Dumas , completely unaware of the future that awaited her son , having failed to make him a violinist , decided to make him a priest . " A what ? " the boy screamed . " A priest . " " Oh , Mother , no ! " " No words , please . Make up your mind to it . " " Wear a skirt ? And say prayers all day long ? Never ! " " Enough . You 've heard me . A splendid opportunity has just presenteditself . Abbe Conseil , my cousin , has begged a place for you in the seminary at Soissons . You do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As Alexandre continued to plead and to protest , his mother informedhim that another one of her cousins , Abbe Fortier , hadp113promised to take him around with him for a few days to give him a taste for the priesthood . This Abbe Fortier was a middle-aged man , rugged as an ancient oak . He enrolled the boy at once in the job of repairing the roof of his pre-Gothic church . And when Dumas flinched at scaling the steeple , with its crumbling stones , to set right the crucifix that had fallen to one side , the abbe tucked up his cassock and did it himself while Dumas gaped with surprise and admiration . Called to minister to a dying woman in a remote and wild sectionof his parish , the priest took along his fishing rod and his gun , and on the return home he stopped at streams and forest glades to show the youth tricks that he had never even heard of . And then , finally , when Dumas saw the abbe enter into all the contests of the country fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could eat the most hard-boiled eggs , consuming over a hundred of them to win the prize , Dumas felt that he had found his vocation : he too wanted to be a country priest . It was a rugged , demanding profession , of which any man could be proud . When he returned to his mother she embraced him with joy . Finally all her problems were solved . But suddenly everything changed : he refused to be a priest . And when his mother stormed at him , trying to understand what had caused this abrupt switch , he ran away to the forest and did not show up for three days . Not until his mother got Quiot-Biche , a notorious poacher of the town , to take a note to him , assuring him that she would no longer press him to be a priest , did he finally consent to come home again . His mother burst into tears when she saw him . " I 've promised not to ask you , but that 's still no reason why you ca n't explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the explanation was quite simple . Full of pride in his new vocation , Alexandre had gone around town telling everyone of his plans . Then he met the two Deviolaine girls , his rich and pretty second cousins , one twelve , the other fourteen , girls with whom , when he was invited now and then to the Deviolaines ' home , he would play the craziest kind of bedroom games : ghosts , itching powder , frogs hidden under the sheets , and the like.  | " Oh , Alexandre , " cried Cecile , " we hear you are going to be a priest ! How wonderful ! " " Yes , " said Alexandre proudly . " I am entering the seminary in a few weeks . " " Perhaps someday you will be our priest , " said Therese and she clapped her hands , and Alexandre preened himself . " Certainly , " he said . " And you 'll hear our confessions ? " Cecile asked , her eyes twinklingmischievously . " And we 'll have to tell you all the naughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " And we 'll have to promise never to be naughty again , " Therese inquired , " and say a hundred mea culpas ? " " Yes , " said the future priest sternly . " But after that , you know what we 'll do ? " Cecile asked . " What ? " " We 'll go right on being naughty again , so that we can come back to you and confess some more ! " With that the two girls put their pretty heads together and whisperedand giggled . " What are you giggling about ? " Alexandre wanted to know . " We 're whispering naughtiness , " said Cecile , " and we must n't tell you about it until you 're a priest . " That was all that actually happened . But it was like an electric shock to him . This is what sent him running into the woods to hide out for three days and dream about the magic of naughtiness that could bring to a girl 's eyes a sparkle that was like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the life of Alexandre and exerted its fascination upon him until the end of his days . His mother , meanwhile , as a last resort , entered him into the local boys ' Latin school run by Abbe Gregoire , who , with the heavy cane which he brought down smartly on his pupils ' knuckles , tried in vain to instill some knowledge into Alexandre 's mind . But Alexandre 's mind was on girls . Besides , he had little taste for arithmetic . Latin and Greek grammar he despised , though he loved to read the classical stories . Indeed , he was good in only one department : he wrote an amazingly good hand.  |p115When  Madame Dumas heard this about her son , she broke down and wept . " It is obvious that he is an idiot , " she said , for she had never seen an important man whose handwriting could be easily deciphered . One day Alexandre asked his mother point-blank , " Mother , can you dance ? " " I used to be able to , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " It was a shock to his mother to realize that her son was growing up . She tried to give him a lesson in dancing , but the incongruity of their size and their family relationship upset her . " Let Abbe Gregoireteach you how to dance ! " she said . Alexandre approached the abbe on the subject and received such a verbal castigation on the evils of dancing that his ears burned . He went about soliciting the help of his classmates . Did n't they want to learn to dance too ? Abbe Gregoire got wind of the movement among his pupils and met the danger head-on . " There will be no dancing in this school ! No girls will ever enter here ! " But the whole school was suddenly caught up with a dancing fever . Perhaps because of the constant danger of war , the boys felt that they wanted to experience as much of life as possible before being snatched away to their death . They approached Abbe Gregoire with the idea of pairing off among themselves and so learning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried the abbe . " There will be no dancingof boy with boy in this institution . " In the end , faculty and student body compromised by letting the boys dance holding chairs in their arms ! Brezette , an ex-infantry corporal , was brought in as instructor and , coming as he did from Napoleon 's army , than which there was never any more dance crazy , he taught all the latest and most complicated steps , chasses-croises , traverses , entrechats , flic-flats , and all the twinklings of the ankles and crossing and uncrossing of legs which were then in style . And also the new dances  --  the waltz and the polka  --  for these troops considereddances too as part of the loot which they brought home from every foreign country where they fought . At his first real dance a girl of the village actually complimentedP116Dumas on his waltzing . As for him , all this energy which he expendedin dancing seemed to return to him like the energy of strong drink , increasing his passion , winding him up for ever more spins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she screamed in ecstasy , she could not help exclaiming , " I 've never danced with anyone who held me with such assurance ! " " That 's because I 've never danced before , " he said , " and I had no idea that a girl would be so light in one 's arms . " " You 've never danced before ? " " Never , " he said . " That 's impossible ! " she declared . " You dance divinely ! Surely you 've had lessons . " " Yes , " he said , " lessons , but not with a girl . With a chair . And from the first , when our class started to get instruction in dancing , it was taken for granted that the heaviest chair in the room , the teacher 's own chair on the dais , was to be my partner . Everybody called that chair Dumas ' girl . ' And I guess it was from having to hold that big chair and dance with it in my arms that I was so surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For this first dance of his , everything he had was borrowed  --  his clothes , his shoes and even his gloves . Indeed , he had totally forgotten about gloves , and only when he got his first partner did he realize that he would be the only male to extend a bare hand . He was horrified . In his desperation he approached a handsome dandy who was just pulling on his gloves . " If you 're not dancing , " Alexandre begged , " let me have your gloves . Just for one dance . " " Certainly , " said the dandy and , stripping off the glove he had already put on , he gave the pair to Alexandre . " Thanks , " said Dumas , and was about to return to his partner when he saw the dandy coolly pull out another pair of gloves and start putting them on . " I always carry an extra pair or two , " the young man said . It was thus that Dumas met Adolphe de Leuven , son of the Count of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle for independence , had gone to the United States and enlisted in Washington'sarmy . Returning home to Sweden , after the war , completelyp117infected with the American spirit , he had soon joined a conspiracy against Gustave III , King of Sweden , who had declared with contemptthat a single Swedish regiment would soon take care of any revolutionary rabble . Privy to the costume that the King was wearingat a masked ball , he had gone up to him and said , " There 's a handsome disguise ! " This was the signal for a fellow conspirator , Anckarstroem , to fire . The King fell , mortally wounded . They had supposed that in a masked ball they would escape detectioneasily , but they were all captured . Only Anckarstroern 's guilt , however , could be fixed positively , because the gun was identified as his . He was sentenced to be whipped with thorns for three days , then to have his murderous trigger hand hacked off , and finally to be decapitated . But at the same time that this sentence was passed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remitted if he named his fellow conspirators . He refused . Whereupon sentence was carried out . His decapitated body , exposed to public view , was found each morning crowned with laurel leaves . As a result of this expression of popular feeling for the American and the French revolutions , the authorities decided to get rid of the other arrested men by perpetualbanishment . Count Ribbing , arriving in revolutionary Paris , was hailed as the " handsome regicide " and feted like a potentate . Eventually he bought himself a chateau near Villers-Cotterets , to which he would now and then retire from his duties as the editor of a Parisian newspaper . It was the son of this man who was the dandy of the ball . The two boys , despite their difference in present fortune , struck up an intimate friendship . Each had lusty republican forebears who had been in the thick of history . And each soon found another reason for intimacy . " What are you going to become ? " Adolphe once asked Alexandre . Alexandre shrugged hopelessly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe someday I can become a notary myself . " " I 'm going to be a writer , " said Adolphe . " A poet , and a dram-atist . " P118Immediately Dumas was jealous . If this idea had ever occurred to him before he had never told it to anyone , but suddenly it seemed to him that he could be nothing else . " I 'm going to be a writer too , " he said . " I want to write like Shakespeare , " said Adolphe . " Shakespeare ? " Dumas asked . " Who is Shakespeare ? " So Adolphe invited him to go to Soissons , where a company was touring in Ducis ' translation of Shakespeare . When Alexandre saw Hamlet , saw ghosts and murder and tragic love , saw insanity , poison , incest , revenge and dueling , all holding forth on the stage to the accompaniment of wild poetic imagery , he took such fire that he cried , " I too want to write like Shakespeare . " And then he leaped at once to action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They did . They wrote three one-act plays , which Adolphe then took with him to Paris . Alexandre lived on in a fever , waiting for every post to bring him money and fame . But one by one the plays were rejected by every producing company . Thus several years passed , during which Madame Dumas became a feeble old woman , barely able to take care of her little salt and tobacco store . Alexandre worked in a near-by village with a notary and had little time for literature , and no money to go to Paris with , though once he managed to sneak off for a couple of days with his gun and literally shot his way to Paris , by poaching game all along the road and paying with the contents of his game bag for his meals and lodging . It was as a result of the notoriety of this tale of successful poachingduring an absence without leave that the notary dismissed Alexandrefrom his employ . One evening , at the Boule d'Or inn , Alexandre tried to get someone to play billiards with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But no one would play against young Dumas for money : he was known to be too good . Finally the innkeeper offered to play with him for drinks . " But you know I do n't drink ! " Alexandre cried. * He never did . But he is remembered for at least one bright little comedy , The Postillion of Longfumeau , and his fame is secure for having founded that great periodical the Revue des deux Mondes.  | " Well , then we ca n't play , " said the innkeeper . But they played nevertheless and Alexandre won six hundred glasses of absinthe . " What am I going to do with six hundred glasses of absinthe ? " Alexandre wondered . " You will drink them , " said the innkeeper , laughing . " In time , perhaps , you will learn to like the stuff . " " Give me some money instead , " Alexandre begged . " Half what it 's worth . " The innkeeper shook his head . " A quarter of what it 's worth ! " Still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched this argument with amusement . " Very well , " said Alexandre . " Give me my absinthe . " The innkeeper took a bottle and poured a drink for Alexandre . He made a face as he brought it to his mouth but he tasted it anyhow and then spat with disgust . Everybody roared . " Faugh ! " screamed Alexandre . " Well , try another glass tomorrow . It takes a long time to develop a fondness for absinthe . " " I like it right now , " said Dumas . " Give it to me . " " There 's still some in your glass . " " That 's just one glass . I won six hundred . I want six hundred glasses . And I want them right now . " The tables were reversed now , and the crowd was laughing with Alexandre instead of against him . The innkeeper tried to squirm out of this situation . Alexandre could have his drinks whenever he wanted . For himself and his friends . Or he would give Alexandre a dozen bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the innkeeper had done before . " Pour out six hundred glasses of absinthe , " he insisted and , turning to the crowd , he asked , " Is n't it the rule of honor that gamblingdebts must be paid within twenty-four hours ? " And so in the end the innkeeper settled for ninety francs rather than make a fool of himself before his customers . Ninety francs ! Dumas had never seen so much money . Why , itp120was a fortune ! " I can go to Paris ! " he cried . " I can become a great playwright ! A Shakespeare ! " And at once he counted out to the innkeeperthe price of a seat on the next evening 's diligence . But when he ran home to his mother and told her of his good fortune , she burst into tears . That her idiot son should try his fortunein Paris was a hair-raising thought . She tried to reason with him . She wept . She knelt before him . She dragged him to the grave of his father and conjured him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remindedAlexandre that far better students of his than Dumas had been content to settle down in Villers-Cotterets and raise carrots and pigs . She took him to their nearest rich relative , Monsieur Deviolaine , who had just been appointed Inspector General of the forests of the Dukes of Orleans . Monsieur Deviolaine , in his usual tempestuous manner , shouted , " I have nothing to say to the most notorious poacher in the whole province . " Instead he addressed Madame Dumas . " I am afraid your son has turned out to be a good-for-nothing , able to net larks and play billiards , but little else , and Villers-Cotterets should be well pleased to get rid of him . However , if he is starving in Paris , tell him to come to my office and I will at least see that he gets a ticket to go back home . " Which one is the true story of Dumas ' departure to Paris I do n't know : whether because he , a teetotaler , won six hundred glasses of absinthe , or whether because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was completely played out all over Villers-Cotterets and its environs and so could hope for nothing further there , this I ca n't answer . But my historical method is the same as that of Dumas : between two conflicting stories I always pick the most interesting . In any case , one evening Alexandre and his mother went through the General 's old correspondence to see what friends he might have had who could now be appealed to for help in getting established in Paris . Here was a letter from the Due de Bellune , who was now , under Louis XVIII , Minister of War . Here were letters from General Foy ,  |p121Marshal  Jourdan , Sebastiani , Kellermann . Here was even one from Bernadotte , now King of Sweden . They were all still alive . Dumas noted down the names and determined to look them up in Paris . Another visit to the General 's grave , and the two , she tiny as a bird and in her perpetual widow 's black , and he tall and as yet thin , poorly dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked in the growing darkness to the inn of the Boule d'Or . One more kiss and one more promise to send for her just as soon as he could find an income , and the postilion sounded his horn , the driver cracked his whip , and the diligence clattered off into the darkness . In the morning , by five o'clock , the coach would have made the sixty miles to Paris . Just put yourself in Dumas ' place . Imagine yourself like him : tall , young , strong , the son or a soldier who was a hero of France , and now , lo ! in the full conviction of your talents and the certainty of your eventual success , you step off the coach at the depot of the Lightning Express Company in the rue du Bouloi , and Paris lies all around you . Paris at dawn . Paris in the month of May . Can you imagine yourself any luckier ? Paris at twenty-one ? Paris : the only city in the world , as Madame de Stael phrased it , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unhappy ? Talk about luck ! What else can you call it ? Not that Dumas would have admitted it . To him , luck , as he said later , was nothing but the natural result of an energetic love affair between man and his existence . " Just as no woman can refuse her favors when a determined man really woos her , " he said , " so life can not help but give you her best when you court her con brio. "  |p122Well  , in that case , never was there such a passionate courtship as that of Dumas and life . Why , even when the man had made his mark , luck continued to shower him with her gifts . What author , for example , has n't at one time or another wished that some member of his family , or some very close friend of his , would either commit a gory crime or be the victim of it ? What relative'slife would not be a cheap price to pay for a ready-made story thus thrust into one 's paws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But have you ever had such a piece of literary luck ? No . Nor I either . But Dumas  --  yes . The Dumas family had been intimate with the Collards of VillersHelonbefore Alexandre was born , and young Alexandre knew the Collard granddaughter Marie Cappelle from her birth . This girl grew up and eventually married a fellow named Lafarge . Marie had good reasons to regret that marriage . Lafarge , for all his courtship manners , soon revealed himself as a country boor with perpetually dirty fingernails , coarse , cruel and stupid , and with a fortune that consisted only of some miserable ironworks supporting a mountain of mortgages and debts . It thus seemed almost providential that the man should develop a severe inflammation of the bowels and die of it . But after the burial , gossip raged like a forest fire and in time compelled the authorities to exhume the body . And then there burst upon Europe a scientific dispute that spread to all the famous chemistsof the period as to whether certain tests conducted on Lafarge 's intestines proved or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arsenic . Chemical analysis was still in its infancy , and , in fact , a positive test for arsenic had been formulated so recently , and the tests themselves so sloppily conducted , that there was room for considerable scientific debate as to the validity of the conclusions . Nevertheless , Madame Lafarge was put on trial to determine whether she had or had not baked arsenic into a cake she had made for her husband . All Europe now split itself into passionate pro- and anti-Lafargists . And so it was that at a time in history when some  |p123monster  or this unfortunate beauty ( according to which side you stood on ) , there was Alexandre Dumas , who not only knew her intimatelybut happened at the same time to be an already wellknownauthor ! And thus he acquired new glory . How much literary luck is one writing man entitled to ? Of course , one will have to admit that this was n't luck when seen from Marie Cappelle 's angle : she was found guilty and went to prison for life , serving ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she expired at the youthful age of thirty-six . Her tale is strangely pathetic , and her prison letters ( full of gentle protests against her fate and convincing arguments demonstratingher innocence ) have , since their publication , earned her the sad name of Saint Arsenic . But for Dumas this was sheer luck . And then , as if this man were n't already enough in the public eye , he had to become involved in the Dujarier affair , a grossly rigged duel in which Dujarier lost his life , and which led to a trial where Dumas figured as one of the principal witnesses and where his astute responses from the stand excited all France . Luck even pursued this man after his death ! For example , in connection with the fraudulent duel that cost the life of Evariste Galois , Dumas ' name will always have to be mentioned , because Dumas was the only person who bothered to note down the name of Galois ' killer : Pecheaux d'Herbinville . Why should anyone have wanted to bother with this detail in what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a young boy who had failed miserably in his entrance examinations for the polytechnicalschool , and was since then loafing around Paris taking part in radical meetings ? Who cared about the death of this poor student who was not yet twenty-one years old ? For it was only some fifty years after Galois died , and when Dumas himself was already dead , that a few pages that Galois had scribbled on the eve of his fatal duel became precious documents in the history of science , and showed that this young lad had possessed one of the great mathematicalbrains of all time . Dumas could have had absolutely no inkling of this when he wrote about Galois . Something of the same kind of posthumous luck working for Du/mas occurs in the matter of Edgar Allen Poe . Dumas has left notes about a meeting with Poe in Paris in 1836 , relating how he found rooms in Paris where Poe could work undisturbed through the night . Scholars have always tended to reject this story as utterly fantastic , but are forced to admit that for precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely no records with which to refute Dumas ! Can this kind of luck  --  the luck of being able to keep one 's name fresh in the public mind even after one 's death  --  can that really be explained as the result of a love affair with life , no matter how ener-getic ? Does n't it seem , rather , to require that famous hypothesis  --  the hypothesis of God  --  that the astronomer Laplace told Napoleon the Great he had had no occasion to call upon when he wrote his vast treatise on the physics of the solar system ? Take , again , Dumas ' luck in the matter of F. W. Reed . This F. W. Reed was a poor boy in Whangarei , New Zealand , than which nothing seems more remote from Paris . Moreover , he labored in a drugstore at tasks that were beyond his strength and that absorbed practically every minute of his waking hours from dawn until his collapse from exhaustion late at night . Saturdays and Sundays brought no surcease : indeed , additional duties were piled upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this wretched child a tatteredpaper-bound book : Monte-Cristo . He could barely steal enough time from his work to read a paragraph a day , a couple of pages a week . But the story gripped him at once and sustained him wonderfully through his endless dull labors . Curiosity , excitement , enthusiasm stole into a boy 's life and transmuted its drabness into adventure . Who could this man be , this Alexandre Dumas , whose name was on the title page of that book ? In little Whangarei , in those days , there was neither bookstore nor library  --  Whangarei is as remote in New Zealand as New Zealand is itself remote in the world  --  and all the boy could discover was that Dumas was a Frenchman , that the s at the end of his name was generally not pronounced , and that he was dead . The boy grew up . His work remained as mountainous as ever.  |p125But  each week he managed to find a half hour or so that he could fill with Dumas . In time , from Auckland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew ever new books from the inexhaustible works of Dumas . Slowly , with infinite patience , he used the minutes of his spare time to master French and thus enabled himself to read the many works of Dumas that have never been translated . And so , in the course of a lifetime of incessant travail , which only in his later years let up a bit , Reed made himself the world 's authority on Dumas and owner of the largest collection of his works . And today , when you hear again that old story of how Dumas copied out one day an article on snakes and sent it off as that day 's installment for his serial , you may query F. W. Reed , who will tell you that he has found no evidence of any such installment and that the story is most likely another one of those exaggerations that the French people loved to tell about their favorite character . It belongs with the stories of how an autumn leaf once floated through the open window onto his desk and was promptly signed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of work . It belongs with the stories of Dumas ' weird collection of medals , and how crowds would gather to stare at him when in full uniform he stood guard before the Tuileries . What a uniform that man wore : the gaudiest of the three authorized ! Black cap with silver eagle and scarlet tuft , and with chin strap of solid silver links . White worsted epaulets . Festooned white shoulder knot with tags . Over his chest yellow cross belts . Dark blue coat , lined with scarlet silk and with scarlet piping and cuffs . Big silver buttons . Trousers , light blue with red seams . Black boots . Yellow gloves . Knapsack of deerskin with fur to the outside , and yellow straps to bind his blue , rolled-up greatcoat . And all over the front of this uniform , his medals ! Paul Huet , the well-known landscape painter , passing him there one day , stopped and blinked . " And you call yourself a Republican ? " he said . " Why a man could get a sunstroke just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm a staunch Republican , and you know it ! " " For a Republican , you have a suspiciously large number ofp126royal friends , " said Huet , running his finger underneath the overlappingmedals . " What about it ? " Dumas asked truculently . " I like kings . It 's the institution I am opposed to , not the man who happens to have been born a prince . " Huet grabbed Dumas and spun him around . " I thought so ! " he cried . " The man has even got medals hung on his behind ! " To which Dumas answered simply and with a touch of sadness , " Those are from kings who have since lost their thrones . " Yes , it was an age of exaggeration , but also an age whose real accomplishments would be difficult to exaggerate . And perhaps the luck of Dumas in finding long after his death a shrine in the antipodes , in far off Whangarei in New Zealand , must be measured against his Herculean labors while he was alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the seas to bid for an exiled writer 's novel , as they did to the isle of Guernsey for Victor Hugo 's Les Miserables , where a Belgian businessman carried off the manuscript after laying down 125,000 francs in gold as an earnest for more to come .

" But . . . but supposing it is all just blank paper ? " " You will still have the right to publish it with my name on thecover , " said Victor Hugo . " That should insure a good sale . " " You are right , " said Lacroix , and he put down his bags of gold . Alas , that kind of gold is gone ! Where is there a writer who could do today what Dumas did in Russia in the middle of the last century ? Meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , Vasili , who wanted nothing so much as to be Dumas ' valet , he said to him , " You 're hired . Go to Paris and wait for me there . " Vasili jumped with joy until he remembered that he was due for his compulsory military service and never would the authorities grant him a passport . Furthermore , he had not a penny he could call his own . Dumas asked for a sheet of paper , for pen and ink , and he satP127down and wrote : " Greetings ! Alexandre Dumas , of Paris and the world , respectfully requests all the nations of our globe to honor this passport and open the borders of their land to the bearer . " Then he added a P.S. asking all railroad and steamship companies to transport Vasili on account and send their bills to Dumas , Paris . When Dumas came back from his trip , Vasili was waiting for him in his apartment with a passport that bore a dozen visas and , clipped to it , twenty or thirty bills from transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with an added note on this order : " A small return for the pleasure of reading Twenty Years After . " Yes , the gold is gone . Dumas saw it when shortly before his death he visited the great Paris Exposition of 1867 and stopped in the Cours de la Reine , where the Palace of Industry was , and watched the huge walking beam going up and down over the great stationary steam engine , watched the great fly wheels spinning smoothly on ball bearings , watched the pistons working furiously . After a long silence he turned to the beautiful Mazeppa , the American-Jewishactress Adah Isaacs Menken , who was his last mistress , and said , " You really think the human spirit can survive that ? " He shook his head sadly . " It is a rigged duel . The machine is bound to win . " A Private Secretary for a Poor LadBUT TO RETURN to that first May day in Paris .

The Count and his son Adolphe were having breakfast in the garden when Dumas burst in on them.  | " I 'm here ! " he cried and spread his arms wide . As Adolphe embraced him and the Count shook his hand , they asked in alarm , " Has something happened to your mother ? " " No , she 's fine ! But I 've come to Paris to be a writer ! " " Hurrah ! " cried Adolphe . " You 've had something accepted ! " " No . Nothing yet . " " Then you have a job ? " " No . Not yet . " " Then you 've come into an inheritance .

" " Well , I 'll get a job . " " How ? " " Easy . " " How easy ? " " Now , now , now , " said the Count , " let 's first ask our good friend if he 's had his breakfast . " " I wish you had n't asked me just exactly that question , " said Dumas , looking eagerly at the good food . " Why , how so ? " the Count asked . " Because if it comes to telling you whether I 've had breakfast , I 'll be forced to tell you the truth . " " Of course , my boy . I expect the truth from you . Always . " " In that case , yes , I 've had my breakfast . " " Well , what 's so difficult about saying it ? " " Because I 'm afraid you will let it stand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , so , " said the Count , light dawning on him . " I accept the correction . I should have simply asked whether you cared to share ours . " " Delighted ! " said Dumas and reached eagerly for the platter of eggs . " Well , now , my boy , " the Count said , " tell us how you are going to get a job so easily . This I would like to hear . " " Why , I went through my father 's correspondence and pickedp129out all the names of his good friends who are still among us today : the Duke of Bellune , Marshal Jourdan , Marshal Sebastiani , General Verdier , General Foy , and so forth . " " And you have written to them ? " " No . I am going to see them personally . " " Ah , " said the Count . " You are going to see them personally . And you have not even written them to expect you ? " " That 's right , " said Dumas , swallowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " That is to say , just as you are , you are going to knock at their door ? " " Yes , " said Dumas . " Why not ? " " Why , nothing , my boy . Nothing . " The truth was that Dumas had as yet absolutely no notion of how ridiculous a figure he cut . He was so obviously fresh from the country , his coat was of such an antique cut and so violent and crude a color , and his hair had so clearly been trimmed by his mother that the effect was ludicrous , and the only reason one could n't laugh was because his features expressed such bumptious and completely innocenteagerness that to laugh would have been like kicking a puppy that is wagging its tail and trying to lick your hand . But though Dumas had no notion of anything 's being wrong with himself , he could not fail to sense the lack of enthusiasm on Ribbing'spart .

" " I had n't thought of it . In any case , they ca n't all be sons of their intimate friends . " " Well , have you any idea of how many would-be writers try to get jobs even on my little paper , every day ? " " No . " " " Would it surprise you if I said dozens ? " " Dozens ? "  | " Well , dozens may be an exaggeration , but I assure you that not a day passes but that I have to tell some ambitious boy like yourself that I have no room for him . " Dumas ' appetite failed him for a moment . He stopped eating and looked at the Count . " You are afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what difference ? You will have had a vacation in Paris . And you will return to Villers-Cotterets with fresh energy and new and saner resolutions . " Dumas said , " You think my coming here is doomed to failure . " ' Well , let 's call it a very risky venture . " " And you would have advised me against it ? " " What else could I do , as your friend ? " " So you , who assassinated the King of Sweden , would have advisedme not to risk coming to Paris ? " Dumas asked . " My dear boy , " said the Count , " it is precisely because I have done both that I can tell you that it is easier to kill a Swedish king than to make a killing in this city of Paris , where hundreds of eager young men pour in every week , each one determined to make his mark . " Dumas sat there for a moment , and the sweat began to form drops on his brow . It was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big foggy question mark . Self-doubt paralyzed him . But after a moment he gathered himself together . In later years he was to say of self-doubt : " A person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself . He makes his failure certain by himself being the first person to be convinced of it . " " Well , I must go , " he said , swallowing another mouthful of tea and rising . " Why are you rushing away ? " " I have so much to do . In the first place , I must buy a copy of the Almanac of 25,000 Addresses , so as to look up all the people I want to see . " " But an almanac costs five francs , " said the Count . " Why spend so much money when I can let you look at our office copy ? " " Thanks , Count , but I have to hurry . I have so much to do . I still want to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room . Paris is full of hotels . "   " I mean a room for rent . I want to bring my furniture here , and my books . " " Yes , but of course you wo n't do that until you 're settled . After all , you have to sign a year 's lease . And you do n't know yet whether you can stay . " " No , " said Dumas , " I do n't know whether I can stay . " But after a pause he added , " All I know is that I 'm going to stay . " He left as quickly as he could , anxious to be away from these good , kind people who had failed to give him a word of cheer just when he needed it most , these rich people who obviously liked him but just as obviously had weighed him and found him wanting . As he ran down into the city , he made up his mind to succeed no matter at what cost to himself . His determination hardened within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drenched it in the tears of self-pity that he refused to let flow from his eyes . He steeped it in his own brine until he knew for certain that it could never come unraveled . And it never did . He bought his almanac and found the address of Marshal Jourdanin the Faubourg Saint-Germain . Jourdan , a former silk merchant , hearing of the rising of the American colonies against Britain , had joined a regiment of volunteers and fought under Washington . He had then returned to France and followed a military career through the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era , and had managed to weather every change of government and still come out on top . A servant opened the door to Dumas and asked , " Whom shall I announce ? " Dumas was struck by the splendor of the furnishings and the startling silver-and-blue livery of the servant . Tongue-tied , he mumbled , " General Alexandre Dumas . . . I 'm his  --  " The servant had already left to report to his master . Within seconds an old man ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly withdrew them , crying out , " Impostor ! flow dare you ? " " I 'm no impostor , " said Dumas . " I 'm Alexandre Dumas . " " Do n't lie ! You insolent dog ! Alexandre Dumas was my bosom companion for years . I knew him as well as I know my right hand . "  | " I 'm his son ! " Dumas exclaimed . " My father is dead long ago . " " Get out ! " cried the Marshal . " Alexandre never had a son . Get out before I throw you out ! " " Please believe me , " Dumas begged . " I had no intention of passingmyself off as my father ... " " Enough ! " said the Marshal and walked back into his study , shutting the door . Dumas shrugged and left . He quickly suppressed the poison of self-doubt that he felt rising again and looked up Marshal Sebastianiin his almanac . The Marshal lived in the Faubourg SaintHonore . Once more , a sumptuous mansion . This time Dumas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're the son of my good friend Alexandre , " said Sebastiani , whose rise to fame was to some extent due to the fact that his family'scottage had been next door to that of the Napoleons on the islandof Corsica . Now his study , bounded by four huge and lavishly decorated walls , contained four secretaries , to whom the Marshal dictated in turn , at four magnificently carved desks . As he passed from secretary to secretary , each would extend to the General a gold snuffbox , from which he would take a tiny pinch of the finest Spanish tobacco . But when he heard that Dumas wanted a career in literature and not in the army , he lost his respect for the lad . " Here are four writers , " he said , pointing to his four secretaries . " I could n't write a word to save my neck , but I can have twenty writers any day I want them . The streets are full of writers . There is only one career for a real man and that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellune , but this former Napoleonic generalwho had achieved a dukedom would not even see Dumas . He sent word through his servant that he would be glad to receive a letter from the boy . After the Duke came General Verdier . This general , to Dumas ' surprise , lived modestly in a top-floor apartment and painted pictures . " I have been accused of conspiracy , my lad , and they have pensionedme off . Today you would be much better off if you had left your country in the revolution and fought against her in the armiesp133of her enemies , for loyalty to your country 's interests is not the way to rise . Remember this : Be loyal , not to your country , but to the party that happens to be in power , whichever it may be ; that is the secret of success in this corrupt age . " Next , General Foy . The famous orator was busy in his study , writing his history of the Peninsular War , amidst books , maps , pamphlets , manuscripts , strewn over chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you 're the son of General Dumas who commanded the Army of the Alps . " " Yes , General . " " I 've been told that Bonaparte treated your father very unjustly and extended this injustice even to his widow . " " He left us in utter poverty . " " What can I do for you ? " " Anything . Because I 'm at the end of my resources . " " Well , that should n't be difficult . I know a place where the only requirement will be that you know some mathematics . " Dumas swallowed . " It was my feeblest subject , General . " " Oh , I 'm not speaking of higher mathematics . Just some algebra , conic sections . . . " " I 'm sorry , General , " said Dumas , blushing . " But really ... " " Well , let 's see . How about law ? You 've studied a bit of that , have n't you ? " " No , General . " " Well , Latin and Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but almost no Greek at all . " " How about modern languages : German , English ... " " Some Italian , but not much . " " Bookkeeping ? " " Please , General , let me confess at once , before I die of shame . I spent most of my time hunting , fishing , reading , dancing . I 'm afraid I was a bad student . But that 's because I had no direction . If you will tell me what you want me to learn I 'll soon know it , because I 'm not really as stupid as I may seem . " " Good . Well , let 's see . . . . But by the way , have you something to live on in the meantime , while you study ? " " Not a thing , General , " said Dumas and felt absolutely crushed.  | " That makes it really difficult . " " Yes , General . But I assure you , whatever job it may be , it will be only a stopgap . You shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will apply myself . I can . I will . " " Yes , I am sure of it . But at the moment there 's nothing to be done . However , I 'll look around . Here . Write down your name and address . " Dumas took paper and pen and started to write , saying , " I 'll get my mail at the Count of Ribbing 's ... " The General exclaimed , " We are saved , my lad ! " " How so ? " " Your hand ! You write a beautiful hand . " Dumas felt utterly annihilated , being reminded sharply of his mother 's judgment that a beautiful hand was nothing but a certificateof general incompetency . Foy , however , went on . " I happen to know that the offices of the Duke of Orleans need an address-writing clerk . You 'll get twelve hundred francs a year , which is n't much . " " It 's a fortune ! " Dumas cried . " Well , then it 's as good as done . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Can I be sure  --  " " Go ahead . This is a political matter . The Duke should be able to say that he has the son of a Republican general working for him . " So Dumas ran off , muttering to himself , " I must study , study , study . I must never stop studying . " " And all the while he went into innumerable houses and saw innumerable rooms , all of which were too expensive if nice and too mean if cheap . But finally he found one with a window on the court and with ugly yellow paper on the walls , but with an alcove that would accommodate his bed , leaving the rest of the room free to be his study . The porter , who with a glance had recognized a fresh country bumpkin in this tall lad with his outlandishly long jacket hanging to his knees and his poorly trimmed hair aureoling wildly about his head , pressed his advantage . " Ah , yes , an alcove . It is n't everywhere now that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fathers understood how to appreciatethat . Nowadays , four walls , voila , that 's what they call a room . " He sighed , as if indeed the world had fallen upon evil days since alcoves were no more.  |p135And  Dumas , though he had the sense to realize that his recognition of an alcove was no particular sign of any great artistic sense in himself , was nevertheless pleased . He felt , however , that he had to be critical of the ugly yellow wallpaper . " Oh , that 's because Monsieur has no idea of how much that wallpapercosts a roll , " the porter said . And Dumas had to admit that he did n't . " Well , that explains everything , " said the porter . Dumas , not sure whether that meant that the paper was extremelyexpensive or extremely cheap , was forced to let the matter drop or else expose himself . The matter of the window , however , was more vital . " I shall be working a great deal , early and late . And that window wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't let the matter of light bother him , " said the porter . " Here we burn nothing but candle ends . They are of the finest wax . And cheap in spite of it . " " Candle ends ? " " Ah , you do n't know about candle ends ? " " Of course . A candle end is the end of a candle . The part that is left in the holder when the candle begins to gutter . " " Ah , Monsieur , there 's a lot more than that to a candle end . " " How so ? " " Well , Monsieur , let us imagine that you are rich  --  which for all I know you may be , for nowadays even dukes and princes prefer to travel incognito  --  and let us say you have fine guests coming to your home . Now , would you bother to light the little bits of candle left over from the previous evening ? No , you would say , Blaise  --  ' I 'm imagining , you understand , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " said Dumas . How good it felt to be taken for rich , successful , intelligent ! " Well , you would say , Blaise , fresh candles everywhere . I have important guests this evening . ' And Blaise would say , Oui , Monsieur , I shall attend to it at once . ' But what will Blaise do with all the little candle ends ? Why , he will put them in a box . And when the box is full , he will come to me . Why to me ? Because he knows I do a modest business in candle ends . The whole neighborhoodP136knows that , Monsieur . I do n't wish to boast : it is a puny business . But it is all mine . And when I buy Blaise 's box of candle ends , he has a bit of money to add to his wages , I have a bit more stock for my commerce , and there is no waste of a commodity which from year to year becomes more expensive and more precious : good wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this works for the best of everyone concerned . The rich have their luxury , the poor have only the leavings , but both have their light , and there , Monsieur , lies the essential , for a candle , short or long , still gives as much light . " Dumas listened with appreciation . It was the beginning of his discovery that each person , in his own way , and on however humblea level , is a philosopher and worthy of being a character in a book . And the porter concluded , saying , " Naturally , I give my own tenantsevery advantage of price when it comes to buying candle ends . And first choice of the best ends . " How could Dumas resist ? And especially when the porter pointed to a piece of furniture which would be thrown in with the room . " What do you say of that ? " " That " was obviously a tall writing desk . But then the porter proudly showed him that the side opened up and there was room not only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also for the user , though for Dumas it would be something of a tight squeeze . " There is a secretaire that can keep a secret , " said the porter , playingup the expression lieu secret , which is French for privy , as indeedin English the word privy too has its nobler meaning in privy councilor and such expressions . The porter did not lie when he said that this combination privy and writing desk was the latest style in Parisian furniture . " Nothing could be more decent , " he explained . " If some evening you have guests , and if they saw something which was nothing but a lieu secret , it would strike the eye . And if a guest were to ask , What is that ? ' it would be most embarrassing . But this way you can always say , That 's a writing desk . ' And it is clear , from looking at it , that it is in fact a writing desk . " P137WHEN , IN LATER YEARS , the English would flock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French theater , " and an English critic ( Percy Fitzgerald ) would write : " From Dumas dates the inundation of the French theater with a bloody spate of slaughterings , incests , adulteries , violations , secret accouchements , represented with the crassest accuracy . . . " and that " Dumas started that rivalry in obscenity which in the end caused the sewer gates to be lifted bodily and a deluge of impurityto wash ' away the last vestiges of decency from the stage ... " one is forced to wonder how much of it may be blamed upon the Parisian furniture makers who launched the style of combination desk and night table where Dumas penned his earliest literary productionsand , so to speak , formed his style . Whether this should be set down as another piece of luck is debatable , but in the meantime this is perhaps as good a place as any to go into a little sketch of manners and morals of the period , with no intention , however , of browbeating the reader into believing that the manners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there are no rules so consistently broken as those of manners and morals . There is no doubt , for example , that around this period doctors launched a number of violent attacks on the Parisian habit of lollingin a warm bath . " Nothing , " they declared , " is so much the cause of indigestion as frequent and prolonged hot-water baths . " They even blamed various kinds of permanent invalidism on this perniciouscustom . But are we to assume anything from such medical warnings ? Where do people actually obey doctors ' orders ? Certainly not in Paris . At this time almost every Parisian home of any affluence contained a popular style of tin bathtub with a heating device underneathconsisting of a tube to hold the hot ashes which could be bought from the neighborhood baker , and a coquettish little chim/ney which rose from that tube to crook a little finger out of a hole in the windowpane . What a joy on a cold Sunday to immerse oneself into such a tub and steep there hour after hour . Balzac says he soaked himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes in this era were still miserably heated . Winter heat is a very recent invention , as a matter of fact . Goethe , at this time , expressed the wish that he might be hanged every winter and be taken down and revived every spring , for the cold months were nothing but an agony of chilblains , coughs and fluxions of the chest . Stendhal tells us that to take off one 's flannels in winter was certaindeath and that in an experiment being made in a hospital all patients so treated turned up their toes and died . Balzac took to the habit of endless cups of hot coffee to keep himself warm . And no wonder Dumas infuriated people later when they saw him work in the depths of winter with nothing on but a thin white shirt , his arms and his neck bare , and only explaining cryptically , " I 'm just naturally warm . " Is it possible that , in such an era , the pleasure of a hot bath really went out of style ? Of all the stories we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the truth and how much as just the winds of opinion and controversy forever blowing over the questions of manners , morals , customs and hygiene ? We are told , for example , that the year 1823 , when Dumas came to Paris , was the year of the Death of Socrates , Lamartine having just published his book with that title . And that Herbault , who was to that era what Madame Eloffe was to Marie Antoinette and what Paquin was to Napoleon III and what Dior is to us today , would have nothing but shades of gray in his styles and long draping effectsto remind us of the agony of drinking hemlock . As for 1825 , it was the year when the play Jocko made such a huge hit . Jocko was a female monkey in Brazil who fell in love with an exiled European , and he with her , out of disgust for humanity and its wealth-corrupted civilization . She was the sweetest little animal and so devoted that she quickly taught herself to sew and cook and to dance and sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most charming little trick that ever hit the Paris stage , P139so contemporaries insist . But one day , having tumbled into a gorge filled with wild animals , she came out with a diamond . Then her European lover gave her no peace , driving her again and again down into the terrible gorge where the wild animals attacked her , but from which she had to bring back the diamonds he craved . At last she came back only to die . Jocko 's stage costume is still with us as the monkey jacket , scarlet and gold-embroidered , and along with other similar garments it was the rage of Paris  --  until the giraffe appeared . Mohammed Ali , that Turkish brigand who became pasha of Egypt and almost caused a war between France and England , presentedthis giraffe to the people of Paris . The public followed with passion the tale of the travails of the poor beast , chained to the deck of a ship as it crossed the Mediterranean amidst the fury of storms . Five cows were brought along to provide milk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck dragged the animal over the roads from Toulon to Paris . And what a sensation when it was finally installed in the Jardin des Plantes , where crowds of vast size flocked to see the beast that stood on the first floor and ate its meal on the second . Men 's collars suddenly became an inch higher . Tall girls were suddenly popular and admired . Hairdressers introduced a coiffure a la gira f e  --  ringlets of hair tight against the scalp to make the head small on top of a long neck . Textile mills wove hundreds of thousands of yards of giraffe cloth , spots of brown on a sandcoloredbase . I have not bothered to find out what the styles of other years were , contenting myself with the old saying , " Plus ca change , plus c'est la meme chose "  --  The more it changes , the more it 's the same damned thing . The battle of Waterloo , we are told , created a revolution in femininepsychology . In one day , the whole conception of woman developedover the revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravely as man  --  was destroyed , and a new woman appearedwho all at once dared not take a step without her smelling salts , a mere scratch being enough to cause her to swoon . The light , antique dresses , often of gauze , which were furthermore dampened so as to cling to every curve of the body and thus imitatethe drap mouille effect seen on Greek statues , suddenly disap-P140peared and the feminine body was once again corseted , and so tightly that it took two men and a bedpost to do the job . The femininebreasts , the nipples of which once stood out like knobs in the chill of damp gauze , were now well hidden , but the bosom itself expanded mightily under the pressure of the corseting and became twin pink blossoms delicately poised on a slender , stalklike waist . The clergy , who necessarily take their occupation of saving souls much to heart , and who for some obscure reason sooner approve of the business of war in which men kill each other than they do the business of sex in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without permanent damage to either and possibly some enjoyment , gave the new styles their unqualified endorsement and in fact their blessing : they saw the corset as an additional hurdle against unchastity . But the new look in the matter of chastity was very real . And when the heir to the throne of France was stabbed and lay dying of massiveloss of blood , and when his wife , the gay Duchess of Berry , was the only woman present to whom one could look for the means to make a quick ligature , the question of whether or not she might lift her skirt and fetch down her garter was a grave moment in history . Or so we are told . Considering the attacks against the institution of royalty , should not a prince die rather than a princess be convicted of open impudicity ? Dumas himself tells us that the success of his play Antony was due at least in part to the brilliant manner in which he solved the problem of how to commit a violent murder on a struggling woman without ruffling her clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So refined did women become that they were shocked at the notion of using a single perfume and thus smelling like some recognizableflower , a rose or a carnation , which might give a man the strange notion that they were ready to be plucked . Fashion dictated the use of ten or twelve different perfumes which were calculated to confuse the male nostril and deprive him of any preconceptions whatsoever . How , in the face of this , statistics continued to show one third of all children of Paris born illegitimate is beyond me.  |p141All  this new feminine refinement did not , of course , prevent a nurse from dressing in whatever old clothes she did n't mind staining , and it would take another forty or fifty years before she would don a clean white uniform , and then , of course , only over her indignant protest : " What ? I should dress up like a bride just in order to give an old man an enema ? " ' Such was the world into which Dumas engaged himself to make his fortune by writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign a year 's lease at ten francs a month , he noticed another door on the top landing . " Do n't worry , " said the porter quickly . " Monsieur will have all the quiet he wants here . The only other tenant on this floor is a most respectable woman who , like me , has her little business . She does for laundries all those little repairs of buttons and little rips which laundriesalways promise their customers and always fail to carry out . She already has two assistants to help her . " A most respectable woman ? Peste ! That was too bad . Dumas imagined a dumpy woman of about fifty , with a mustache already darkening a stout upper lip . Yes , it would have been nice to have had the stimulation of a young and pretty neighbor . But , of course , one can not ask for everything . One can not hope to fall into the latest type of combination writing desk , plus cheap candle ends , and expecta ready-made mistress too . No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so he ran off to the depot in the rue du Bouloi to get his baggage and to make himself at home in his new abode , intending to pass the night on the floor . He was in a hurry to move in and be as settled as possible , because he wanted to go out and look at the town and see the theaters , which , of course , he would n't be able to enter since he was already so short of money . But just to feel the tingle of the air along the boulevards , see the crowds on the sidewalksor jamming themselves into the cafes , and look at the billboardsoutside the theaters ! ' This , of course , does not apply to the various religious organizations and the municipal creches , the hospices , for foundlings , incurable women , etc. , many of which were conducted with exemplary cleanliness . Others , on the contrary , were notorious for carelessness , filth and a shocking death rate . P242When he had put his baggage away in his still almost-empty room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street from the Opera Comique ) , and was about to rush downstairs , he paused for a moment and looked at the door of that respectable woman . Why not ? he asked himself . He walked over to the other side of the landing and knocked . After a moment a clear voice came through the door . " Yes ? Who is it ? " It was a voice that did n't sound at all like that of a woman with a mustache showing on her upper lip . " I beg your pardon , " said Dumas . " I 'm your new neighbor . I 've taken the room opposite . And I have as yet none of my things , which are being sent from the country . So , if I could have a glass of water . It would be a great kindness , which I hope to be able to repay . " " One moment , Monsieur . " Through the thick door he could hear faintly the sounds of a woman in slippers as she fetched a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the inside chain would permit , just sufficient for a hand to tender the glass . But Dumas had seen enough : it was obviously the hand of a young person . Pale and smooth . Dimpled . He took the glass . " Merci , Mademoiselle . " The voice corrected him coldly . " It is Madame . ... " " Your pardon , " Dumas said quickly . " My name is Alexandre Dumas . " But the voice did n't answer . The door clicked shut . " Many thanks for the water , " said Dumas . And through the door came the cool answer . " Pas de poi , Monsieur . " There you are : which of us , as a young writer , has n't wished for just such luck as Dumas had : a garret in Paris and on the same landing a young person with a clear voice and a shapely hand , with whom it would be a pleasure to develop an intrigue . And as forbiddingas that word Madame might be , it was yet more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it suggested a past that was correct and foreshadowed a future that might be even more interesting . In short , a widow . Young and yet not inexperienced . She was , Dumas soon learned , Marie-Catherine Lebay , fromp143Rouen , poor , abandoned by her husband , and busily making a living for herself . It is about time that we came to the woman in the case . For of course there was a woman involved in the " Duel after the Masked Ball . " In fact , more than one . And was it not Alexandre Dumas himselfwho first summed up all criminological investigation in three terse words which have become famous : Cherchez la femme ! Find the woman ! ? Words that he put into the mouth of his Monsieur Jackal , in what was probably the first detective story ever to be put on the stage. *With that clear voice ringing in his ears , with that smooth white hand floating in his mind 's eye , with the promise of all manner of delight ahead , Dumas fairly bounded down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! To hell with economy on his first night in Paris ! He had an extra louis , a twenty-franc gold piece among the smaller coins in his pocket , and he took out this gold coin , spun it in the air , and said , " Heads I have dinner and theater tonight . Tails , the same ! " But as he came down to the street level , he met up with the porter , who in a tone of very gentle reproach , said , " Monsieur no doubt has many weighty matters on his mind . " " How so ? " " No matter , " said the porter . " You will remember later . " " Remember what ? What have I forgotten ? " " Le denier a dieu , " said the porter . " The farthing that belongs to God . " " Of course ! " cried Dumas , and without hesitation he flipped his gold louis to the porter , crying , " Catch ! "  --  which you can be sure the porter did . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came running out and promised Monsieur Dumas that his room would be kept spotless for him  --  for a mere five francs a month . " Agreed ! " said Dumas , and walked on feeling wonderful . ' He was originally a character in Dumas ' novel Les Mohicans de Paris , wearing green spectacles and constantly dipping into his snuffbox and forever saying , " Cherchez la femme ! " Without a doubt the literary ancestor of all the great ferrets from Victor Hugo 's Javert to Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes , and years before Hawkshaw of The Ticket-of-Leave Man ( 1863 ) , usually given that credit.  |p144But  not absolutely wonderful , for something in him said , " What an insane idea to spend one 's first Parisian evening in a gesture . What an insane idea to give two month 's rent for a tip . " And yet it was grand . It was more than grand : it was superb . It was the first of a whole train of gestures that Dumas loved and lived for . Say what you will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is nothing but life lived for mere pyrotechnics  --  ah , but what else makes a man click , what else makes him give off a sudden burst of light , what else if not a gesture that spotlights him for a moment , picks him out of the obscure crowd , makes an individual of him , separates him from the nameless millions ? What will you say of a man who has never indulged in a gesture ? How will you sum up his life except that he left an estate of so and so many dollars , or a widow with so many children ? Would there have been a Dumas at all without the gesture ? After all , what right had he to come to Paris and say , " I am going to be a writer " ? Where is this talent you claim to have ? Show me the evidence of it ? How dare you aspire to be anything more than a garcon de cafe ? Who is your mother anyhow but an old widow woman who goes from neighbor to neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will carefully tear in squares and roll each square into a cone or horn , into each of which she will measure out a carefullyweighed sou of salt or tobacco ? What is it but the most piddling of businesses , carried out in pennies , with fractions of pennies as the net profit ? Yes , he should have come to Paris and taken a job in a cafe and run from sunrise until the gas was extinguished , from one table to another , with an " Entendu , Monsieur , " and a " Voila , Monsieur , " to drag out his mattress at night from behind the screen where it lies along with warped billiard cues and broken checker sets and old watering cans , and sleep among the tables in the stile odor of spilled drinks and saliva-soaked cigars , no more and no less than ten thousandother garcons do each night in Paris . What , after all , made him different ? Nothing except the courage of bluff . Which is how every man starts if he starts at all . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or do that , when he has never been anything or done anything before ? Does n't he have top145start by saying I can build the pyramids , and I can beat the Philistines , and I can discover America , and I will fly ? The bluff , the gesture , is nothing but a man stretching himself and eventually , by dint of stretching , really filling out his new size , finally making his empty boast a reality . It was bluff alone that saved Dumas ' life against the Baron de B. , who in seventeen duels had never failed to draw blood from his opponents , crippling one for life and putting two underground . Once Dumas was standing behind the Baron in line to get his cloak and saw the Baron drop a copper coin into the attendant 's saucer . Dumas put down a hundred-franc bill as his tip . " You have made a mistake , Monsieur Dumas , " said the girl . " I refuse , " said Dumas out loud , " to accept the Baron de B. as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Baron responded with an immediate challenge to a duel . " Tomorrow morning at six o'clock in the Bois de Vincennes . " " I have the installments for three different serials to write in the morning , " said Dumas , " and that will keep me busy until two o'clock in the afternoon , and at three I have a rehearsal at my Theatre Ilistorique , so between two and three is the only time I have free . Let 's make it two-fifteen prompt , so I can be back in plenty of time . " Then he handed the cloakroom attendant a five-hundred franc bill . " Since I am so busy , will you do me a favor ? Take the Baron 's size and select a fine casket . Also place an order for a first-class funeral . Obviously , from the tip he gave , his death will be a genuinefinancial hardship to his heirs . " It was by pushing through with his bluff that Dumas turned the tables on the Baron , who for the first time in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said to himself , " if I should be killed over a matter of a few francs for a tip . " The following day he called on Dumas and the affair was settled with an apology and a handshake . Above anything else , Dumas respected the fine gesture . He gave immortality to Morisel , who was nothing but an old wine sot dying of dropsy , because Morisel pulled off one of the supreme gestures of history . " What is this I 'm dying of ? " Morisel asked Dumas . P146Dumas said to him , " What ? Has n't your doctor told you ? " " Sure . He has said dropsy . But what is dropsy ? " " Dropsy  --  that 's when your kidneys can no longer void the fluids of your body , " Dumas explained . " That too I know , " said Morisel . " That is why they tapped me . And then when tapping would not drain me , they made me sweat . But still I know nothing . Imagine dying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's as if I had simply flunked out of life . It 's a disgrace . " " What do you propose to do about it ? " Dumas asked . " Find me a surgeon who will open me up and show me exactly where the trouble lies and explain to me just exactly why . I must see it with my own two eyes . I must look my enemy straight in the face like a man . " Naturally no surgeon could be found who would do this for Morisel . " You could n't stand an operation , " they all said . " You 'd be dead before we got well inside of you . " Then Morisel hit on this idea : let Dumas find him a corpse dead of dropsy . To everyone 's surprise Morisel remained alive while for a whole week the city morgue and the hospitals were searched for a man who had been killed by dropsy . As last they found one , and Morisel had Dumas buy it for the usual price of the day : six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the autopsy : forty francs . The body was brought into Morisel 's room and placed beside the moribund'sbed . And the surgeon went to work and was able to demonstratethe situation in terms of the organs and tissues of the human body . It was an excellent conference , in the best style of l'ecole de medicine of Paris : lucid , witty and at the same time profound . " So that 's it , eh ? " Morisel said . " That 's it , " said the physician and put aside his scalpel . " Now you know the whole story . " " It was the thought of dying in ignorance that was simply killing me , " Morisel explained . " Now that I know exactly where I stand , I can expire in peace . You 'll see . I 'll give no more trouble . Thank you all . " Then he said to the doctor , " If you should want to repeat your lecture to your students , you may have my body . " P147The doctor , touched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropsy cases one wants in wine-drinking Paris . " Minutes later , Morisel was dead . All Paris mentally doffed its hat to a man who could pull off a final gesture of such proportions . And Dumas was able to write a noble obituary for a man who otherwise would have passed on as just another name to be stricken from the registry of the living . It was the same when an old actor named Perrinet came to him and begged him for a part . Dumas , who knew the man as the worst actor in the world , refused , but offered him twenty francs . But this miserable actor was too proud to accept charity . " If you ca n't give me a part in your play , give me at least some little work , so that a man can keep his self-respect . " Dumas thought but could n't dig up a single idea . After all , he had a dozen deadbeats always working for him as gardener , dogkeeper , fly-chaser , stagehand , walk-on  --  everything one can imagine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , " there is a service you can do me . I 'm in the midst of a story in which I must know the temperature of the Seine . See if you ca n't get hold of a thermometerand find out for me . " The man could and did . And Dumas gave him five francs . This was quite a fee to pay for so small a service , but Dumas figured he could n't very well give him less . Then to Dumas ' surprise the man appeared again on the following day . " The temperature of the Seine has changed to fifty-seven degrees Fahrenheit today , Monsieur Dumas , " he informed him . Dumas handed him five francs and was on the point of saying , " Thank you , but I sha n't be needing the temperature any more , " when he realized that this would confront him once more with the problem of what to do with this man who refused charity and insisted on a job . And so , every day , year after year , one might see an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pont-Neuf , between the few shops that still stood on that ancient bridge , and carefully lower into the Seine a thermometer tied on a string . And afterward hurry off to find Dumas and convey to him this precious information . All Paris saw it , and all Paris wondered how soon Dumas wouldP148grow tired of forking out five francs a day for the temperature of the Seine . But Dumas behaved with the utmost correctness . No matter where or when it might be that the former actor came to him with this information , Dumas would reach into his pocket and draw out the money . " Sixty-two degrees , did you say ? " " Sixty-two and a half , Monsieur Dumas . " " All , you do n't say so . Well , thank you infinitely , Monsieur Perrinet . Nothing is so important for a Parisian dramatist as to know the temperature of the Seine . There is an intimate connection betweentheatrical attendance and the condition of the atmosphere . You do me a great service . " And Dumas would turn to whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who never fails me . Never . " You 'd imagine he was saving Dumas ' life and career each day . And once , when Dumas left town , he paid Perrinet , on his return , five francs for every temperaturereading taken during his absence . Naturally it could no longer be stopped . By this time it had becomea gesture . And if Perrinet had n't been taken one day to die at the Hotel-Dieu , Lord only knows how long the gesture might have gone on . For then it was n't only Dumas who missed his faithful collaborator , all Paris missed a bit of mummery that had daily warmed one 's heart and daily restored one 's faith in human nature . And even strangers coming to Paris would ask their guide when they could see the man who took the Seine 's temperature for Monsieur Dumas . Dumas spoke a few words at the funeral ceremony . " Never , " he said , looking around at the crowd that had followed the poor man to the grave , " never did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborators you are the only one who never missed an appointmentor failed to bring in your assigned share of the work . May the earth rest lightly on your bones . " Detractors of Dumas ' claimed that the press of people at the funeral was nothing but a concourse of starvelings who thought that Dumas would now want someone else to take the temperature of the Seine for him , and each one hoped to be appointed to the sinecure left vacant by the death of Perrinet . Dumas , however , with his sure theatrical instinct , realized thatP149for Perrinet to have a successor would turn the whole business from gesture into a cheap publicity stunt , which some people had all along declared it was . These people insisted that this gesture was no different from the advertisements which Dumas kept inserting into the daily papers under the Personals . For example : " Will the gentleman who stared me out of countenance the other evening at the Tour de Nesle performance please be there tonight again ? There will be a message for him . Signed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off very well , some hundred or more Parisian gentlemen feeling themselves sufficiently deeply involved to purchase that many more tickets to Dumas ' play for that evening . To RETURN NOW to the gesture of the flipped gold piece . Dumas went away feeling both elated by his gesture and downcast by the thought that he must now practice a double economy by skipping both dinner and theater . He had not yet learned how luck makes up to those who know how to execute a great gesture . He had scarcely walked the boulevards for ten minutes when he spied an old boyhood friend through the window of a cafe . It was the son of the music teacher who had tried so hard to make a violinist out of him . Dumas rushed into the cafe . " Hiraux ! " " Dumas ! " And the two young men embraced each other . " What in the world are you doing in Paris ? " Dumas cried . " Is n't it clear enough ? " Hiraux retorted . " I own this cafe , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe ? Why , you lucky dog ! " " But you ? What are you doing here ? " " I 'm going to write . " " Write ? What ? Journalism ? If so you 've come to the right place . Half the journalists of Paris drop in here . "   " No . I want to write plays . " " Ah , that 's another story . Though most journalists try their hand at that too . But come , we must have a good talk about it all . Wait for me a moment ; I 'll go order a dinner for the two of us . Surely you 'll dine with me ? " " With all my heart ! " said Dumas . " Well , sit down here while I take care of things . What paper do you want to read ? " " Any paper . " " You mean you do n't have your paper yet ? " " I have n't had time to look into the matter . There are so many papers here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know them . Every shade of politicalopinion has its paper here . This is the Constitutionnel , which is now the Journal de Commerce , because the Constitutionnel has been suppressed by the Censorship . And here 's the Drapeau Blanc . And here the ultraroyalist Foudre , and here the Reunion , which has also had its censorship troubles and used to be the Opinion , and before that it was the Pandore , and before that the Miroir , and I do n't know what before that . And here 's the Courier Francais , and here and here and here , other papers . You study them while I go order dinner . " Dumas leafed through the papers , trying to find his way into a tangled political argument over which every paper had a different story to tell and a different opinion to draw . He could n't make head or tail of it , but he supposed that he would have to eventually since it appeared that everybody was making such a fuss about it . This too was something to learn . After dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write plays ? " " Yes . " " You 'll make a fortune . That is if you write one as good as Vampire . " Vampire ? " " You mean you do n't know Vampire ? Why , it 's the sensation of Paris . No one has ever seen anything like it . Why are you sitting here talking to me when you ought to be going to the theater and learning your trade . "  | " Where is it playing ? " " At the Porte-Saint-Martin theater . Hurry . It 's at the other end of town and there 's such a line-up at the box office you 'll never get in if you do n't get there early . " Dumas ran more than walked , determined to be one of the earliestthere . But though it was an hour before the performance was scheduled to start , he found all approaches to the theater blocked by a queue that wound itself around and around . As he stood there chagrined at the thought that he might miss this great play he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dumas turned around . " You mean me ? " " Yes , you , you with the frizzy locks and the coat down to your knees . " " What 's wrong with me ? " Dumas asked , bridling quickly at any aspersions to himself . " Oh , nothing , my friend . Absolutely , totally , nothing at all . But it has given me the idea that perhaps I might be of service to you . " " In what way ? " " Do you want to see this show ? " " Yes , of course . That 's why I 'm here " " I thought so . You see , right away I said to myself , There 's a man who wants to see this show . " " Well , what about it ? " " Only that you will never see it if you go to the end of that line . At least five hundred people here tonight will never get into that building . " " You mean it 's no use my waiting ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He held up two fingers . " Two francs ! " " Two francs ? " Dumas exclaimed . " That 's a lot of money . " " Well , you want to see this show , do n't you ? " " Yes . " " Well , two francs does it . " " Where will I be sitting ? " Dumas asked , for he was under the impression that the two francs the man was asking from him would entitle him to a seat inside , and not just to a position in the line-up . " You have your choice of the whole theater , " said the man in the line.  | " I can sit wherever I like ? " Dumas asked . " Absolutely . " Convinced , and determined to see this sensational show thatcould draw such an avid crowd , Dumas paid the man two francs . The man said , " Now , here . Stand close to me . Right up close . " " Why ? " Dumas asked , puzzled . " Because , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before you get a chance to slip in , and the place will be lost . " So Dumas stood close and , as the man pulled out , he pushed into his spot . A moment later a tremor of life went through the line and it began to move . Soon Dumas stood before the box office . He wanted to move past and into the theater , but the way was barred by a man who said , " Ticket ? " " Ticket ? " Dumas wondered . " No . I do n't have a ticket . " " Stop holding up the line ! " someone yelled in back of him . The man behind the wicket said , " Well , are n't you buying aticket ? " " Must I have a ticket to get in ? " Dumas asked . The people around laughed . " You think it 's for free ? " " Move ! Move ! " the crowd yelled . " But . . . " Dumas stuttered , " I already paid a man two francs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a ticket ? " " No ! " " Get going ! " the impatient crowd shouted . " Come on ! Make up your mind ! " " Give me the cheapest seat , " said Dumas , feeling miserable at having already spent two francs . " One franc for the pit , " said the man behind the wicket , and Dumas paid , took his ticket and went in . He looked around with curiosity at the theater , the huge prosceniumwith its fringed and embroidered curtain , the boxes to either side and the tiers of the orchestra and the gallery like gigantic shelves above . And everywhere oil lamps glittering and casting their rays of light . Already he felt himself transported into a fabulous world of unreality . P153Vampire , Vampire , he said to himself , wondering what the word meant . And then he noticed that there were seats ahead in the pit from which one could get a closer view of the stage . Already some hundredpeople were sitting there , and Dumas wondered how they had gotten in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there did n't seem any way to explain how so many people could have gotten into the theater before him . He moved up and sat among them . " Who are you ? " a man asked . " I 've never seen you before . " " I 'm new here , " said Dumas . " Duchard send you ? " the man asked . " Who 's Duchard ? " " How did you get in ? " " I bought a ticket . " " Hey ! " said the man to the others . " Here 's someone who bought a ticket ! " Everyone looked at Dumas as if he were a freak . " Is that a wig ? " someone asked . " Or is that your real hair ? " " My real hair , of course , " said Dumas indignantly . " It 's real ! " the man screamed . " It 's really real ! " And everyone roared with laughter . " What 's funny ? " Dumas cried , rising in his seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to give it . " He meant he was prepared for a duel . But no one took him seriously . And Dumas , standing amidst the sarcasm and the catcalls that surrounded him , grew purple with fury . Violence boiled within him . But at that moment a tall man pushed his way toward Dumas . " You 're not a Roman , " he said accusingly . " A what ? " " Are you a Roman ? " the man repeated . " No , " said Dumas . " I 'm from Villers-Cotterets . " This reply caused such a burst of guffaws that for a moment the people around him could only point at him and double up with laughter . " I do n't see anything funny , " said Dumas , with a withering glare . This only increased the laughter . " He does n't see anything funny , " people said to each other , gasping and slapping each other . P154Dumas , white now with rage , let the back of his hand out against the nearest man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moment as four scarlet splotches . " Ho-ho ! A fighter ! " the crowd shouted , their laughter suddenly stopping . They started to climb over the benches , piling in toward Dumas . But the tall man barred their way . " You will please come out with me , " he said politely to Dumas , but with an unmistakable ring of authority in his voice . " This thing has gone far enough . " " What have I done ? I just came here to see a play . " " You have created a disturbance , Monsieur , and therefore you must leave . Now please do n't drive me to the use of force , because I am inclined to believe that you will get the worst of it . " Dumas , mad as he was , could not but realize that he was outnumbereda hundred to one , so he followed the gentleman out of the pit and into the corridor and out past the ticket taker to the box office just ahead of the queue that was still filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Dumas cried , " You mean I ca n't see the play ? " " Certainly . Exchange your ticket for any other seat in the house , but keep away from the pit . " " What ticket ? I have no ticket . " " Your stub . " " What stub ? " " Why , the stub of your ticket , my friend . " " But I have no stub . " " In that case , Monsieur , you have no ticket . But you are at liberty to buy one at the office . " " What ! " exclaimed Dumas . " I must buy still another ticket , after buying my way in twice already ? " " I 'm sorry . But for an exchange of seats you will have to show either a ticket or a stub , and since I do n't have any to give you , you will have to buy one . And let me give you this final piece of advice , Monsieur : never try to sit with the Romans again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's pretty clear , is n't it ? " " Romans ? Romans ? They 're no more Romans than I am. "  |p155The  gentleman stared at Dumas . " Are you really so green that you do n't know what the claque is ? " " The claque ? " " Yes , the hired applauders . " " People are hired to applaud ? What 's the matter ? Does n't the public do its own applauding ? " " The hired applauders do it better , " said the gentleman . " And they drown out the hissers . " And with that the gentleman left , shaking his head as if unable to comprehend such abysmal ignorance . Dumas , furious , bought another ticket  --  this time for two francs fifty  --  in the orchestra stalls , though his mind kept adding the incredibletotal that this play had already cost him , and he decided that he was going to show the management what he thought of them and their play and their hired applauders by hissing the performance to its disgrace and failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman who was calmly reading a book , and Dumas just sat there waiting for the curtain to rise so as to let loose his fury . But the rise of the curtain startled him to the point of forgetting to hiss , for the stage was so dark that one could just see vaguely a scenery of rocks and stunted trees , and there was the sound of wind in dry leaves , and then a flash of lightning that revealed the interior of a grotto with tombstones and vaults , and after that a low growl of distant thunder threatening a storm . Startled , then fascinated , Dumas forgot to hiss . Indeed , he was so enchanted that the only extraneous thing he noted was that his neighbor contined calmly to read his book , paying no attention to the performance . Meanwhile , on the stage , the storm gathered , and then a kind of unearthly light appeared in the grotto and one saw angels descending . The angels lifted up and set in place their great wings and then , in the most musical voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of vampires , wonderingfor what mysterious reason God permits such hellish monsters to inhabit the earth , to dwell in old graves and to leave their gloomy haunts at night and wander among the living , seeking a young and beautiful maiden on whom to wreak their horrible practices , sucking her blood until she gradually sickens and dies.  | " Hush ! " whispers one of the angels , and draws himself and his fellow celestials deep into the dark recesses of the cavern . " Here comes a vampire now . " The monster , a tall and distinguished Scottishlord now appears , in a black cloak , the folds of which he manipulates like the wings of a giant bat . He moves the heavy cover from a tomb and lifts out a lovely girl clad in filmy white cerements . And as the angels in soft stage whispers inform the audience that the maiden is not really dead , but only in a deep trance due to a drug , the curtain falls on the prologue . From the pit where the claque was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with the poundingof heels and the shouting of bravo ! and bravissimo ! And the audience , including Dumas , carried away by their enjoyment of the play , applauded enthusiastically . From all parts of the theater came cries of approval . Only the gentleman beside Dumas let out a loud hiss . This brought Dumas to his senses . He remembered that he too had intended to hiss . And at once he stopped applauding and joined his neighbor . As if to drown them out , the vigor of the applause was doubled . " Chat ! " yelled the gentleman beside Dumas . And went into anotherhiss . " Chat ! " yelled Dumas . And he hissed again . " Throw them out ! " came the cry from the claque . " Throw them out ! " the cry was repeated in all parts of the house , and the fury of the hand-clapping swelled like a thunderstorm on a metal roof . And the more the gentleman and Dumas tried to make their hisses heard , the more the audience drowned them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never stop , and Dumas grew worried lest he might have to pay a fourth time to get back into the theater . But in the end it did die down , and the gentleman , red in the face from his exertions , turned to Dumas with an engaging crooked smile and said , " Ridiculous play , is n't it ? " " Ridiculous ? " Dumas asked , genuinely shocked that this man could think for even a moment that this fascinating play was anythingless than a masterpiece.  | " Stupid . Silly . Vampires . Trances . Lot of rubbish , eh ? " " I found it wonderful , " said Dumas with such a burst of sinceritythat the gentleman was forced to believe him . " Wonderful , eh ? " " The best thing I 've seen since Hamlet ! " Dumas declared , forgettingto add that Hamlet was about all he had ever seen on the stage . " You do n't say ! Then why did you hiss ? " " Because that is my privilege , " said Dumas stoutly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't wish to . I defy them ! " " Bravo , young man . Freedom in the arts ! I subscribe to that myself . " And with that he returned to his book and went on readingto himself . As for Dumas , he recalled now that his neighbor had been readingall through the prologue . Why , he had n't given the play so much as a look . By what right , then , did he hiss ? And what was he doing here in the theater at all , since all he cared to do was sit there and read his book ? Dumas ' interest was provoked and he examined this strange man . He was tall and swarthy , and so slender that he seemed to have no real anatomy , just an armature of wires on which God had forgotten to sculpture a human being . And yet his face was very alive and friendly , and over his nose , which was pushed all to one side , there passed one twinkling smile after another as if the man were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dumas wondered , could be so amusing and could hold this man 's interest so strongly that he did not pay any attention to the spectacle on the stage ? Bitten with curiosity , Dumas leaned around in his seat , twisting until he could read the imprint on the binding . It said : THE FRENCH PASTRY COOKContaining recipes of all varietiesof French pastryTogether with Lenten dishes andSixty waystoPrepare eggs " Forgive me for interrupting your reading , " said Dumas politely , " but I see that you are as fond of eggs as I am . " The gentleman put a thin , transparent finger as a marker in his book and said , " On the contrary , Monsieur , there 's nothing I despise more . " " But this book that you are reading , and which even made you miss the play . . . " " Pooh ! The play . But this book  --  that is something else . This book is one of the most valuable I have ever acquired . " " I should like to get one to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is an abbe who once at a contest ate over a hundred eggs and would easily eat two hundred if he knew various ways of fixing them . " " My dear friend , this book is far too valuable and too rare to give as a present to an egg eater . " " Why , what 's it for , then ? " " Why , to delight a bibliomaniac . I see you do n't even know what a bibliomaniac is . " " No , Monsieur . " " Well , a bibliomaniac is a biped who ca n't afford shoes for himselfor his children because he spends all his money on rare books . He himself is usually so poorly dressed that people sometimes give him pennies , thinking him a beggar . But actually there 's no difficultytelling the two apart . Because a beggar washes himself at least now and then . A bibliomaniac has n't time for such nonsense . " " I see . " " No , you do n't see . You ca n't see , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that only eight copies are known to exist , and that this copy is the rarest of all because it has exceptionallywide margins . Now do you understand ? " " Yes , sir . " " Why do you say yes , sir , when actually you do n't understand a thing . Who was Elzevir ? " " I do n't know . " " There were any number of Elzevirs , cousins , nephews , sons and uncles , and they all published books in Amsterdam about two hundredyears ago , and it 's a study in itself just to separate one Elzevir from another . "  | " Yes , sir . " " Confound it , why do you say yes , sir , when you still know nothing ? " " Because now I 've found out something , and I trust if I express myself politely perhaps you 'll tell me more , and then I 'll find out something else . " " Well , you 're not so stupid at that , young man . What else do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the theater if you are a bibliomaniacand did n't intend to watch the performance ? " " Why should I bother with these invisible spirits when I would much prefer to see the invisible snakes that exist in every glass of water , the invisible crocodiles that exist in every spoonful of vinegar , the invisible dolphins that play in every drop of milk ? " " What ? " cried Dumas . " Crocodiles in milk and dolphins in vinegar ? " " Of course . Get yourself a solar microscope , latest model , and you can see it for yourself . " By this time the curtain had risen and the play went on and Dumas was entranced again as he shivered with fear when the vampire made secret assignations with the heroine for midnight in the cemetery , and when , amidst a volcanic eruption and a rain of fire , a further mysterious apparition displayed itself . Dumas ' neighbor calmly continued his reading until the end of the act . " But you are missing a wonderful play , " Dumas exclaimed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You certainly are . " " I 'd much prefer a play about things that really count : steam power , air balloons , piston guns , electricity , printing , gunpowder . " " Then you do n't believe in vampires ? " " On the contrary , I not only believe in them , I have seen them with my own eyes . " " How so ? Through a solar microscope ? " " No , face to face , in Illyria , which is the historic ground of vampires . I knew there a dead man who came every night to eat dinner with his son and his daughter-in-law , and then one evening heP160said , Now it is your turn to come and have dinner with me , beside my grave . ' Then we all went to the cemetery and disinterred his body and found it pink as if in life . The heart was torn from him , swollen with fresh blood , and a flaming pitchpine torch was driven through the body . After that he never returned to trouble anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Dumas . " Then perhaps you can explain to me why there are people hired to applaud . I happened to sit among them and they threw me out . " " Ah , so it was you who created that disturbance down below ? " " Yes . " " Well , of course , the claque is an honored part of every theater . " " Honored ? Do n't you think it is ridiculous that the public should not be left to applaud or to hiss as they please ? " " My dear boy , you do not know the first thing about a claque , do you ? " " What is the first thing ? " " Why , that the claque was first established by Nero in Rome . " " Oh , is that why they are called Romans ? " " Precisely . And I 'll tell you why the claque is a useful thing . Imagine some evening , when it is raining and a cold wind is blowing , that you come in to the theater . Imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you will be sneezingtomorrow , whether you would n't have done better to have stayed home . . . . The actors and actresses do their best , but it is a cold , damp house , and the cast can not put its heart into its work , and the play fails not because it is n't a good play but simply because in wet tinder the best flint and steel can only fizzle out . Now do you see where the claque fits in ? Do you see how they warm things up , start the ball rolling and create at first an artificial enthusiasm but which soon becomes the real thing as the audience quickly loses itself in the play , forgets the weather outside , and has a good time ? You see how everyone is the better for the hired applauders ? The actors and the actresses , the play itself , and of course the audience , which is an indispensable part of the theater . " " I see , " said Dumas . " No , you do n't see anything yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists something worse . "  | " What is that ? " " The clique . Yes , it is either clique or claque in the theater , and personally I prefer the honest claque to the dishonest clique , for the clique can work against public opinion , and work to create an audience for poor taste , whereas the claque can never do anything but evoke public opinion . No claque would dare applaud a play that the public genuinely insists on hissing . Do you see ? " " Yes , I guess I begin to see , " said Dumas . " No , I am sure you do n't . Because the claque too is part of the performance . A good joke on the stage is not merely good because you want to laugh but because someone starts the laugh going and the sound of this laughter is part of what makes you laugh , or laugh all the heartier . And especially if there is someone in the claque , as there always is or should be , someone who has a throat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old carpet being ripped up from the floor . They call such members of the claque rigolards and they are paid particularly well , and the best of them are stout gentlemen who seem to be risking apoplexy by their laughter and who have the rare art of popping their buttons , which is something that always pulls down the house with gales of fresh laughter . Now perhaps you begin to understand . " " Yes , I think I do . " " But of course you do n't . For you still know nothing about the women who are also members of every claque , and who play a wonderful role , especially the ones who sit scattered in the audience and at appropriate times know so well how to twist a handkerchief and catch their breath with a half-smothered gasp , and who can sniffle so gently that it is heart-rending and no woman can resist it . Do you see ? " " I am afraid to say yes , " Dumas replied . " You will still deny that I see . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-claque . " " The anti-claque ? " " Why , most certainly . Do n't you think that at a good play there should be at least one person who will hiss , so that others may shush him , and if he persists that there should be cries of Throw him out ! ' which excites everyone and makes for a play not only on thep162stage but in the audience as well . The whole performance becomes a kind of free-for-all in which there are no passive spectators , but in which everyone participates noisily . " " Ah . . . " said Dumas . " Ah what ? " " Ah , so it is you , the anti-clique . Now I understand why you do not even look at the play , but just look up from your book now and then and hiss . " " You just think you understand , my friend , but actually you still understand nothing . " " What ? Is there more ? " " There is always more to be learned , my friend . Always more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Dumas eagerly . " Because I want to write plays myself . " " Oh , really ? You aim to be a writer ? " " Yes . It is for that that I have just come to Paris . " But the conversation was interrupted again by another act . By this time Dumas , in spite of the continued excitement of the play , was more anxious to resume his conversation with his neighbor than to learn about vampires . Nevertheless , the play continued to hold him . After the curtain came down and the applause was over , the gentleman with the crooked smile said , " So you wish to become a writer ? " " Yes , sir . " " Have you already written something ? " " Nothing really good . No , sir . " " You are first finishing your studies , eh ? " " Well , not really . I mean , I do n't know how one studies to be a writer . " " " Why , by first studying the best writers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aeschylus , of course ? " " No . " " Sophocles ? " " No . " " Euripides , Seneca , Terence , Plautus , Aristophanes ? " " No , sir . None of them , I 'm afraid . " " Well , what have you read ? "   " I would rather hear from you what I should read , " said Dumas , " than confess to you how little I have read . " " Well , then , let 's proceed . After the classic playwrights , read the others : Shakespeare , Lope de Vega , Racine , Corneille , Moliere , Voltaire , Beaumarchais , Schiller , Goethe . . . . Young man , what is the matter with you ? " " How do you mean , sir ? " Dumas asked . " Your lips are trembling so strangely . " " Oh , I am only repeating silently what you are saying . I want to be able to remember them all . " " Good . Above all read the three greatest works of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " " In my opinion they are Goethe 's Wilhelm Meister , Walter Scott 's Ivanhoe and Irving Cooper 's Spy . " Once more the play started , but this time Dumas scarcely paid attention , for he was busy trying to remember all the books and all the writers that he had to read . And then the play was over and the audience filed out . Out on the street Dumas did n't want to lose sight of his neighbor , but the latter obviously had not much interest in having the young man around him any longer . " Good night , young man , and good luck to you , " he said . " Oh , Monsieur , I 'm so grateful to you for everything you 've told me . But frightened too , because with so much reading to do , I do n't know if I shall ever again have time to write . " " You 'll write , young man . You 'll write when you 're full , just as a pitcher overflows when too much has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have time enough to pour . " " But there 's so much to study : Aeschylus , Sophocles , Euripides , Aristophanes , Seneca , Terence , Plautus , Shakespeare , Lope de Vega , Racine , Corneille , Moliere , Voltaire , Beaumarchais , Schiller , Goethe ... . " Well , you 've got a good memory at least . But of course you must n't read only the playwrights , but also the great poets : Homer , Virgil , Dante , Tasso , Cervantes , Milton .... " " Yes , sir . " " And then things are coming out all the time . For example , Latouche has just issued a volume of poems by Andre Chenier , ofp164whom hitherto we knew almost nothing except that he perished thirty years ago under the guillotine , but who , from now on , will be known as one of the greatest poets of France . You must get that book and read it . " " Yes , sir . " " Well , good night . " " Just tell me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anti-claque ? I ca n't believe it . And yet , without looking at the play , you hissed it . I keep asking myself , Why did you come at all ? " " Here , young man , I 'll show you . See this ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , what do you see ? " " The billboard . " " Yes , but what does it say ? " " It says : Marie Dorval and Philippe , starring in Vampire ... " " Yes , go on . " ... a play by X. " " Ah . A play by X. " " Yes . " " Well , X  --  that 's me . And can you imagine anything more wonderfulthan to sit in the audience and hiss one 's own play and have people cry Throw him out ! ' ?

What other writer coming to the capital city of his country would bump into the most important literary figure * of the day on his ' Nodier wrote many charming tales , still readable , and in addition some fantastic histories . His Memoirs are largely invention , his History of the Secret Societies in Napoleon 's Army is largely fiction . His tale of his imprisonment under Napoleon and the frightful tortures to which he was subjected is utterly false.  |p165first  night ? Such things happen only once in a thousand years . Home , finally , late at night , in his barren little room , with only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself down in his alcove , with his rolled-up coat for a pillow , and could n't sleep . And did n't want to sleep either . He thought of General Foy asking him , " Do you know law ? Do you know languages ? Do you know mathematics ? " He thought of Hiraux in the cafe saying , " What ? You do n't know what paper you want to read ? " He thought of X in the theater saying , " Aeschylus , Euripides , Sophocles ... " Would he ever be able to talk like X , saying again and again , " No , you do n't see , because . . . " How filled one 's mind must be with knowledge to be able to talk in learned essays . He must do that someday . Tomorrow he would start to read and he would n't stop , he 'd never stop , until he was so full that he would pour out like a pitcher . And then one day he would be in the theater while they were giving a play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a box , would sit there and hiss , and the public would yell , " Throw him out ! " And then the word would be whispered around : " Why , that 's Dumas . He wrote the play . He 's Monsieur X. " And everyone would laugh and applaud . No , he could n't sleep . He had to get up from the floor and walk up and down like a tiger in a cage . He looked out of his window and saw the silent courtyard and the roofs and chimney pots . And in the silence , the silence of those dark , far-off days when cities at night were silent with a city-silence that is gone forever from the world , he listened to the soft whisper of the night wind . He felt that he had no need of sleep , that he would never sleep again . He was absolutely on fire . Yes , he could feel himself burning , with a cold flame , and stretching out his hands before his eyes , they seemed to glow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist . He could feel an aureole of vague light spilling around his head ... . From that night on he felt himself a different person . An elect.  |p166A  favorite of fate . And the next day when he went to work he felt that his trancelike condition continued . The glow was always there with him . He knew it was , at the same time that he knew that no one could see it but himself . When the office manager Monsieur de Broval ordered him to copy a letter , he obeyed , wrote swiftly , accurately , but all the while his mind was elsewhere , repeating the list of books he must read : Goethe 's Wilhelm Meister , Scott 's Ivanhoe , Cooper 's Spy . Monsieur de Broval looked at the copy and approved . " Excellent , " he said . " Now fold it . " And Dumas started to fold it . " What are you doing ! " Monsieur de Broval cried . " Do n't you know that envelopes for kings and princes must be folded in squares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised , and he picked up a pair of shears so as to trim his page and be able to fold it square . " Stop ! " cried Monsieur de Broval . " Do n't you know that a letter to a man of dignity should never show the marks of a scissor , that good paper must never be cut , only torn ? " " I 'll remember that , " Dumas promised , and proceeded to tear the heavy Montgolfier paper . " Almost square envelopes are for letters addressed to ministers and ambassadors . Letters folded oblong are for chief assistants , inspectors , subheads of departments . Those below receive letters folded English style . " " I 'll remember , I 'll remember , I 'll remember , " Dumas promised . And he did indeed remember . He became one of the best copyists in the office of the Duke of Orleans . His work was faultless and his writing clear as copperplate engraving . And yet all the while he was asleep . Or , rather , in a trance , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , so that all the while his real mind could go over the books he had read , could memorize a thousand scenes from plays , could remember ten thousand lines of poetry , keep in mind a hundred thousand details from history , science , art , until in his speech and his writing he never failed for an apt illustration . Discussing one day the work of the Frenchman Ducis , who claimed to have " perfected " Shakespeare by eliminating the gross-P167ness in the same way that the Englishman Bowdler did , Dumas said , " In Rome , until Pope Gregory forbade it , there were doctors who had a sign on their door : Boys Perfected Here . ' The sign meant that here a boy , with a twist of the wrist , could be made into a soprano for the Papal choir . Ducis and Bowdler have similarly perfected ' Shakespeare . " So Dumas copied the Duke 's correspondence and studied at the same time . Next to him , at the same desk , worked a man named Lassagne , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history  --  Joinville , Froissart , Monstrelet , Chatelain , Montluc , SaintSimon . Dumas added their books to the list of Nodier . He bought the newspapers and studied them , and went to see every show he could . His room bulged with reading material . He had twenty-four hours a day , and no need for sleep . The trance in which he copied letters , folding them into squares for princes , almost squares for ambassadors , oblongs for inspectors , English style for lesser officials , was in itself a kind of sleep whenever he wanted it to be so . And as he went through the day , he felt the glow that wrapped itself around him , giving him poise , letting him march with sure steps forward into his life . Daily he grew more certain of his power . He could feel it in his hands . And once when his fellow clerk Lassagne had to take his little daughter to the dentist and the little girl was howling with fear , Dumas passed his hands gently over her face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to her . And when she came back she said proudly , " It did n't hurt at all . " Some years later he was to run across the writings of Puysegur and learn about Mesmer , and he would suddenly realize that everythingthey talked about he had discovered long ago in himself . The only thing he did n't know was that it had a name . It was called " magnetic " or " odylic , " later " hypnotic " power . Yes , talk about luck ! The man had everything .   " . A Prince of Wales Was Born to Me " WHEN nm THIS MAN ever have time for love ? As a reader he was an abyss that engulfed whole libraries . As a writer he became a tidal wave that threatened continents . " Cacoethes scribendil " an American critic exclaimed in the North American Review , after Dumas had published his hundredth title . Dumas ' art , so he implied , was actually nothing but a disease : the writing itch ! Incurable ! " Furia francesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen translators were busy at the same time turning Dumas into Italian , applying thus to Dumas the expression coined by Machiavelli to describe the maniacal impetuosity of the French soldiers at the battle of Fornovo . But epithets never stopped Dumas . Like Mozart , from whose pen flowed a never-ending stream of concertos , arias , quartets , symphonies , operas , Dumas too claimed that his mind went on all the time whether he was asleep or awake , and that the business of producing a book with him was mostly a matter of copying down what already existed in pretty much of a finished state in his head . Penniless in 1851 , after years of unexampled profligacy , and threatened by a horde of creditors , Dumas escaped debtor 's prison by going to Brussels . " What do I owe ? " he asked his money man Hirschler . " Close to a million , " said Hirschler in disgust . " Pooh ! " exclaimed Dumas . " What 's a million words ? I 'll do it in less than a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Hirschler burst out in fury . " I said a million . Do you understand ? A million ! And when I say a million I mean a million francs . Money . Not words ! " " And I still say what 's the difference ? " said Dumas , shrugging . " All right , so it 's not a million words I must write , but three or four million . But it 's still the same thing . " " No , it 's not the same thing ! " Hirschler declared . " Will you neverp169learn that a hundred francs can be invested and will return two or three or four or five francs a year ? For all eternity ! And the capital will always be there ? Forever ! Can you do that with words ? Can you invest a hundred words and get back four shiny new words every year in interest and still have your old hundred words just as good as new ? No . In fact , your hundred words will be yours for only a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for words ! " And he snapped his fingers . " And a good thing for humanity , " said Dumas , " that words are not property . How could the world ever pay the debt it owes to its poets if it had to pay interest every year for the use of the words of Moses , Homer , Virgil , Shakespeare and their heirs ? It 's hard enough to keep paying the landlords forever without expecting the people to pay their artists forever . Imagine paying again and again for the Ten Commandments and for Hamlet 's Soliloquy ? And yet who would not rather be homeless than without the shelter of such creations ? " Hirschler fumed at such unrealistic talk . But the question is : what is " real . " Dumas thought people who were concerned about rents , interest , profit rates , were groping about in fog of confusion and fantasy . He felt like Balzac , who once interrupted a discussion on politics and politicians by saying , " Let 's talk about serious matters . What did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vandenesse 's proposal to Mademoiselle de Grandville ? " The characters in his books had to Balzac more reality than those in life . And was he so wrong ? Is not Pere Goriot a thousand times more alive today than Louis Philippe 's minister of marine whose dame you do n't even know and , being told , will promptly forget ? All right . So one owed a million francs . To work then ! Dumas rented himself a little palace on Waterloo Boulevard in Brussels and sat down in a garret room and wrote . Downstairs every evening , amidst the remnants of his Delacroix paintings and his Barye bronzes , and his enamel candelabras holding fifty wax tapers each , he gave balls and concerts , entertained now the exiled Victor Hugo and other political refugees , and now a troupe of dancing girls ... .  |p170And  the volumes poured out of him . Novels , stories , plays . But in particular this was the period of his Memoirs . These Memoirs , totaling well over a million words , scarcely take him beyond the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on page 1062 ( Volume III , page 54 of the English edition ) , that Dumas speaks of the birth of his son , which occurred in that yellow-papered garret in Paris , where he had discovered , on the other side of the landing , a soft voice and a dimpled hand ... . He writes in his Memoirs : " . . . a Prince of Wales was born to me . That 's all . Eight words . Not even the whole sentence . Eight words for his first-born . Where is reality ? Where is the furia francese ? Where the cacoethesscribendi ? Eight words . And not so much as one word about the mother either here or before or later . As much as to say : mother unknown . What had happened suddenly to this cataract of words ? Is this not the same man who will , at the age of sixty-eight , write to his publisher Lemerre ( one of his army of publishers ! ) : " After more than five hundred volumes  --  I stopped counting them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career with a book on cooking .... " And what a monster of a cookbook he produced ! Eleven hundred pages , with no less than eight pages devoted to the subject of mustardalone , exhausting it down to the detail of the necessity of preparingdifferent mustards for men and for women . To illustrate what a haute cuisine really is , Dumas will tell you about the duties of just one of the many personages involved in the maintenance of the cuisine de luxe at the court of Louis XVIII . Monsieur Petit-Radel , for example , in addition to superintending the library of the Institute of France , selected peaches for the palace . No jeweler could have brought to the appraisal of a diamond more care than Monsieur Petit-Radel lavished on a peach , rating it according to color and aroma first , then according to the savor and the creaminess of the juice , and finally according to the flavor and firmness of the flesh . For , to Monsieur Petit-Radel , the relishing of a peach was an experience involving the sum total of a sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Because at the table of Louis XVIII , a peach met some pretty heavy competition . For example , grilled chops . Have you any idea how grilled chops were prepared for the Bourbon palate ? Three chops placed together and grilled as if one and then served as one . It was the guest at the King 's table who himself separated the three chops and , discarding the two outer ones as mere husks , directed his attention only to the tender center chop into which all the rich juices of the outer chops had been driven by the heat of grilling , while itself at the same time escaping the rough touch of the flame . With that kind of competition a peach had to rub its eyes open early in the morning . And no wonder that when Monsieur PetitRadelbrought his peaches to the King 's table , his hands trembled , his eyes were filled with tears , as he waited for a word of praise to drop from the heavy Bourbon jaw . That 's the kind of cookbook it is : you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your lips drool , your mind is lost in a haze of exotic and exciting flavors and odors . Nothing , indeed , seems lackingto make this book the masterpiece of the romantic era of literature , nothing but a heavier charge of sex . But everything else : geography , history , art , science  --  all appear , contemplated through the taste buds of man . Here is Louis XVI , fat and phlegmatic , more concerned with his belly than with his life , sitting through the debates of the revolutionary convention , his greasy hands tearing apart a roasted fowl , his gluttonous mouth chewing evenly , while polemics crackle around him and eventually force that monarchical head beneath the blade of the guillotine . Here is Lucullus of Imperial Rome , budgeting his cook to the expenditure of a thousand dollars per guest per dinner , and his anger exploding when once he dines alone and discovers that his cook has spent less than the stipulated amount . " But since you were eating alone , " the cook excuses himself . " Alone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm what you call alone that the dinner must be extra choice . For it is then that Lucullus is the guest of Lucullus ! " Here are Talleyrand and Mr. Hahnemann the homeopath , and Louis XIV and almost anyone you can think of . For never did Dumas forget the lesson that Charles Nodier gave him in the theater , theP172lecture on the claque : read , read , read , fill yourself and then pour . And he poured . He became a cataract of words . Wherever he went , out came the articles , the plays , the books . Once , for example , during a hunt , Dumas , complaining of lassitude , shot one more partridge and then excused himself from his friends and went back to the inn and sat down in an easy chair before the fire . There his friends found him still asleep when they returned from the hunt . When he awoke they asked him , " Did you have a good sleep ? " " Just a cat nap really , " Dumas said , yawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he pulled the pages out of his pocket . Were there any circumstances in which this man found it impossible to write ? Why , he wrote travel books not only when he traveled , he wrote them even when he did n't travel . For example , he planned a trip to the Near East , but never got there . Do you imagine for one moment that the book about that trip was thereforenot written ? Then you do n't know Alexandre Dumas ! The book appeared in Paris under the title Fifteen Days to Mount Sinai . London published it as Traveling Sketches in Egypt and Mount Sinai in a translation prepared by " a Biblical Student " ; and New York saw it in a new translation under the title Impressions of Travel in Egypt and Arabia Petraea . And it was a success ! For years every tourist to the Near East wanted to repeat Dumas ' exciting climb of the Pyramids and his amusing swim in the Nile . Even the Khedive of Egypt wrote to Dumas : " Egyptians themselves did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and opened our eyes . " Dumas never set foot in Egypt in all his life ! No , it 's impossible to imagine a situation in which Dumas could n't write . In 1832 , for example , he got involved in republican demonstri  --  tions against his former boss , the Duke of Orleans , who had mean . while made himself King of France ; and at the disastrous anti  --  royalist riots at the Cloister of Saint-Merri Dumas was almost killed.  |p173Just  how close an escape it was is shown by the report the newspaperscarried the following morning : " Among the insurrectionists trapped at the Cloister was the recently successful playwright Alexandre Dumas . Along with the other prisoners he was tried by summary courtmartial and immediately executed by firing squad . Relatives may claim the bodies of the victims at the morgue this afternoon . " It was the day of his weekly dinner at the literary salon of Charles Nodier , of which he was by then a respected and beloved member . Dumas hastily penned Nodier a note : " Assure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't feel as cocky as his note is shown by the fact that he ran at once to Gosselin , one of his publishers . " I 've got to get out of France ! As soon as possible . And I 'm broke . For four thousandfrancs I 'll do you a book on Switzerland . " Gosselin said , " Your execution does n't seem to have affected your need for money , but it has certainly damaged your brains . Books on Switzerland are a dime a dozen . Everybody and his aunt has done a book on Switzerland . The whole subject is passe . I 'm convinced that people will soon give Switzerland back to her cows . " " There is certainly one book on Switzerland that no one has writtenso far , " Dumas argued . " What book is that ? " " A book about Dumas in Switzerland . " Dumas was right , but Gosselin could n't see it . So it was not Gosselin , but another publisher , namely Dumont , who made his fortune out of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Switzerland , a book in which the biggest piece of Swiss mountain scenery is undoubtedly Dumas himself . Dumas toured Switzerland on foot , which is , of course , still the only way to tour a country . He learned to love the Swiss people and to hate the Swiss landlords . He conspued the beds of the inns In which for a man of his size the night was a long struggle between shoulders and toes as to which should have possession of the short sheet and the still shorter cover . He hated especially the four-franc table d'hote dinners , where simple equity compelled him to eat a double portion of each food so that his meal should end up costing him only the two francs it was worth , although he was forced toP174admit that he was still four francs out of pocket , while his belly , stuffed with unsatisfactory food , was even worse off . Tramping from Bex , he came to the Stagecoach Inn of the town of Martigny and there got less bed and less food than usual . This landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote it up in his book . In his book the affair goes this way : " Monsieur ! " cries the genial innkeeper . " Welcome ! You have arrived at a lucky moment ! " " How so ? " " Bear ! " the innkeeper exclaimed , throwing wide his arms . " Bear ? Where ? " " In the kitchen ! Where else ? We are serving bearsteak today . " " Is that such a wonderful thing ? " " What ? You do n't know bearsteak ? Bearsteak with butter sauce ? " " Never had it . " " Then , Monsieur , you are in for a treat . That is if Monsieur will dine a la carte instead of at the table d'h8te . " Dumas hesitated . Bears , for him , had always been cunning creatures , all roly-poly with fur , who , with a chain fastened to the nose , danced with charming clumsiness to the violin of a wandering musician . Still , the idea of bearsteak with butter sauce was tempting and Dumas agreed to dine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A short while later the bearsteak appeared preceded by an odor that was divine and capable of overcoming all childhood scruples . The innkeeper hovered over Dumas ' table , while his guest cut up the tender meat . Dumas paused with the first bite caught on his fork . " So this is really bear , Monsieur ? " " My word of honor ! " said the innkeeper . Dumas dipped the piece in the sauce and then popped it into his mouth . " Hm ! Why it 's excellent ! " he cried . " What did I tell you , Monsieur ? " said the innkeeper . Dumas went to work on his steak , relishing each morsel with ohsl and ahs !  | " Must have been quite a beast , " said Dumas respectfully as he noted the size of the cut . " Indeed , sir . Seven hundred and sixty pounds . A monster bear . " " You killed him yourself ? " " Ah , no , Monsieur . Not bear . That 's for real hunters . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " " You can imagine , Monsieur . Those beasts can rage ! They are really dangerous . " " You do n't say ? " " Would you care to know about this one ? " " Most certainly , " said Dumas , continuing his advance into his steak . " Well , this animal was stealing the pears from the orchard of a local farmer , a man named Mona . And this farmer asked one of his friends to stay up with him one night and ambush the animal . Which they did . But the size of the pear-eating monster upset them , and their two shots failed to kill it . Wounded , the enraged animal turned upon its attackers . The men used their guns as clubs . Then they ran . The owner of the orchard stumbled and fell . The other escaped , screaming desperately for help . " Dumas had regretfully reached the final segment of his meat , and cut it into halves to make two morsels of it and thus make it last longer . He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining butter sauce . " What happened then ? " he asked , putting the piece in his mouth . " He came back with help and the brute was soon finished off . " " Yes . And then ? " " And then what , sir ? " " Why  --  the other hunter . The one who fell . The one protecting his pears . " " Oh . I 'm afraid there was n't much left of him . " Dumas was just wiping the last bit of butter sauce on the last piece of steak . " You mean . . . " The innkeeper sighed . " A hungry bear , that 's a mean customer . They 'll devour anything . There was n't enough left to make a burial . " P176Dumas suddenly felt no appetite for the final bite . He pushed it around for a moment on the plate and then laid his fork down . " Monsieur is finished ? " " Yes , thank you , " said Dumas . " I believe I 've had enough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Absolutely , " said Dumas . " Since Monsieur enjoyed the steak , I 'm sure he 'll want to do his bit for the widow . The other hunters have turned over to her the total of the state bounty for each bear killed  --  namely , eighty francs  --  but we are also opening a subscription for her . If you would care to sign this paper and make some contribution , however slight ... " " I can do better than that , " said Dumas , rising on unsteady legs . " I 'll give her back her husband . . . 1 " And he ran hastily from the table . From the moment this story appeared , first in the Revue des Deux Mondes , and then in book form , often reprinted and widely translated , the Stagecoach Inn of Martigny began to be besieged by tourists determined that they too must have the experience of eatinga bearsteak . " Bearsteak ! " the innkeeper would moan . " Yes , like the one you served to Alexandre Dumas . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! Telling people that I served a bear that had eaten a human being ! " " Oh , but we do n't insist on a bear that has fed on human flesh . Just bearsteak with butter sauce . " " But I tell you I have no bear ! I never had bear ! I never served Dumas any bear ! And what 's more I never will serve any bear in this inn ! " But still the tourists flocked to Martigny , and there were some heavily trafficked days when the innkeeper had to post himself in the yard of his inn and simply wave the people away . " No bear . No , no , no ! Go on ! Go on ! " And he would tear his hair in his rage . " If ever that Dumas dares to show his face in Martigny again , 1 ' 11 have him arrested . I 'll sue him for every cent he has ! " Dumas finally had to admit that he had imagined the whole scene simply to make something out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any inn of Switzerland , and one of the worst taNa d'hdte he had ever sat down to . Just as Victor Hugo had to write hisP177poem to the Hotel of Bedbugs , scratching it on the wall of an inn in Bray , because the little creatures had kept him up all night . And Carle Vernet , who was a trompe-l'oeil painter of great ability , painted a startlingly deceptive turd on the floor of an inn where he had passed a smelly night . " What is a man of talent to do when he encounters human stupidity , filth and cheating ? " Dumas asked . " Besides , a bear had indeedbeen killed in Martigny only the day before my arrival . And had mine host been a smart innkeeper he would have been only too delighted to have had the opportunity of offering his guests somethingexciting in the way of food . What right has a man to build a hotel , to set it down on the highway , luring in travelers , if he does not intend to offer them real hospitality ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so confoundedly limited , my little revenge on him could have been turned to his advantage . It was only up to him to have himself the most famous inn of Switzerland . All that was needed was for him to buy up the bear of the whole region , or even to have imported them from the swamps and forests of Poland , and people would have come to him from all over the world to eat his bearsteak with butter sauce . But no , instead of making himself a fortune he prefers to keep on running a miserable inn and have the satisfaction of calling me a liar . " No , no , Dumas did n't have to travel in order to write . And when he traveled , he did n't necessarily have to have adventures . Did n't he have his perpetually active mind as a substitute for reality whereverreality failed him ? No , there was nothing that could stop that pen of his from racing on and being forever exciting , amusing , instructiveand , if not always truthful , at any rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his son . What could possibly have happened in that garret on the Place des Italiens between that ardent giant and that woman with the soft voice and the dimpled hand ? The father said nothing except : " . . . a Prince of Wales was born to me .. .. " And the son , when grown and become famous as Alexandre Dumas fils , also said nothing . And when his mother passed away and was found to have left a diary which she had kept religiously all her life , the son made a little bonfire of it . P178AND YET LIFE is never completely destroyed . Even in the shifting sands of the Sahara desert , seen from an airplane , one can still spot geometric depressions arranged in quincunxes , where grew the trees of Carthaginian orchards two thousand years ago . For him who looks there is always a hint here and a hint there . So serious a work , for example , as Professor Hippolyte Parigot 's study of the dramas of Alexandre Dumas pere contains flashes of material on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are in the middle of the nineteenth century , when , if ever , Paris confirmed her reputation as the sex capital of man . In that century of peace from Waterloo to World War I , victories , if any , had to be achieved in the boudoir for lack of any other field of battle . All through the civilized world people stood aghast at the spectacleof pleasure-mad Paris . Nowhere else was the carnival season so dissolute . Nowhere else did the whole population seemingly go mad night after night , erupting from their homes at the stroke of twelve , dressed in fantastic costumes , or more often in a fantastic lack of costume , and , masked or unmasked , go singing and dancing through the streets , beating one another with blown-up pig bladders , shouting gay indecencies , and generally carrying on , until the morning sent them home in a state bordering on paroxysms . It was an age of sexual scramble . Thirty thousand excess females in the city of Paris threw all previously accepted valuations of chastity , virginity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moneyed tourists , determined , no matter what the cost , to do in Paris what they could n't do at home , contributed to the chaos . Nowhere else but in Paris could a magazine print a picture of a man drawing his pistol on another man while a woman throws herself before him clasping his knees , begging : " Have mercy on the father of your children . " In what other city would a dance orchestra dare introduce an anchor chain as one of its musical instruments , obvious though itp179be that nothing else in the world can make the precise startling and stimulating sound of an anchor chain ? In what other city did composersof dance music vie with each other in setting off firecrackersor shooting off pistols ? A form of orchestral competition that was to lead finally to Musard 's discharging a mortar during his musical performances at the Opera balls . And then one evening Musard had the inspiration to hire a musicianwhose sole instrument was a chair . Yes , a chair that this gifted instrumentalist proceeded to raise high overhead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again with insane deliberation until he had smashed it to splinters . Whereupon he grabbed up a fresh chair . The crowd howled with delight . They stamped and kicked their legs into the air . They went into a delirium when Musard thus unveiledhis " contredanse of the smashed chair . " They mobbed the orchestra and carried off the conductor in triumph . And then , when Alton-Shee , a peer of France , combined the frenzy of the gallopade and the madness of the chahut and achieved the indescribable cancan , pandemonium was reached : it was the deluge , the witches ' sabbath , the feast of Belshazzar , the reign of Gog and Magog , when a couple of thousand screaming dancers launched themselves into the dissolute gymnastics of the cancan . Then the whole world pointed to Paris and cried , " Babylon ! The whore of Babylon ! " and entire populations waited with bated breath for a tongue of fire to come licking down from Heaven and consumethis den of inquity . The whole length of the Boulevard du Temple was given over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters , to intimate theaters , to circuses  --  all competing for the small silver of the average Parisian , while outside in the open air a horde of clowns , acrobats , tightrope artists , singers of popular songs , vendors of patent medicines , operators of popinjay trees and shooting galleriesheightened the competition by appealing for the pennies of the poor . Among the most popular of the sports of the period was that of the greased pole , the mast of Cockaigne , mythical land of plenty , which was supposedly reached only from the top of this slippery device . P180What a sight , of an evening , amidst the feeble orange glow of whale-oil lamps and gas jets , to follow the contortions and maniacal struggles of a contestant , half naked , shiny with sweat and grease , as he would make his way up this lubricated pole to bring down the laurel wreath from the top , a laurel wreath that entitled him to the prize of a gold louis ! To watch the poor man squeezing his ribs and even calling upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach , and especially to follow his hysterical efforts to hold his position with only one arm , so that with the free hand he might reach into the sack of ashes which he carried tied to his middle , and with which he hoped to win for himself another boost upward  --  this spectacle held such a fascination for Parisians of this time that nowhere else did pickpockets do a better business than among the lovers of this sport . For them it was indeed the land of Cockaigne . And the barker would shout his comments and encouragements , some of which came perilously close to wounding good taste , for it was altogether too easy to draw curious parallels : " Come on , young man ! Only ten foot more to the laurel wreath . Do n't disappoint us now . Is it encouragement you 're waiting for ? Very well , ladies and gentlemen , let 's give the man the music . Let 's add to the prize money . There 's no melody like coins falling into the brass bowl . Let it sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice and ribaldry . " Come on down , Gustave . I 'll show you a different kind of climbingthat 's more fun and less work ! " And another would shout , " Use your head ! Wipe the grease away with your hair ! " And still another , " There 's a knothole to your right . No . Up a little higher . Crook your finger into that . " What a moment of drama it was when an exhausted climber could go no farther and all his multiplied efforts only made him lose height instead of gaining it . What a sight when a man , bringing into use not only his fingernails but even his cheek and his nose , still could not stop the downward slide that pushed the nasty tallowright up into his nostrils . How his muscles writhed in this futile combat against the steady pull of lubricated gravity ! And then the tragic heap a man made when , covered with aP181mass of white grease and black ashes , he lay gasping at the foot of the pole . Never did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death putting an end to all of man 's mounting ambitionsand his overriding hopes than this final plunge earthward after all his expenditure of effort . Here was life perpetually slaying man 's perpetual dreams of success . But the barker wasted no time . " Who 's next ? " he would cry at once , shaking the bowl of contributed coins . " Our prize is getting bigger all the time ! Up there is a louis of gold and down here this bowlful of money . Take one , take all ! Come on , ladies and gentlemen ! Prove to yourself that you have the strength and the courage to make a success of your life ! " And if no contestant appeared , he would change his tune a bit , taunting the people , declaring that the pole was easily climbed . " Come on , Jeannot ! Show the public how easy it is to get to the top of the mast of Cockaigne ! " And without another word , Jeannot , his assistant , would smear his hands with ashes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell like boa constrictors as he climbed up as easily as a monkey . " Ah , here we have a contestant . That is if this young lady will kindly release him . Mademoiselle , you should encourage your friend , not try to stop him . Young man , with your height you wo n't have far to climb . " The crowd cheered the tall , young , bushy-haired man as he quickly paid his franc and then pulled off his boots and socks . He then bared his torso and finally rolled up his trousers into two tight rings just beneath his groin . He was swarthy and powerfully built , and the girls went " Oooh ! " The attendant tied the sack of ashes around his middle . And the barker cried , " Here 's a man who is determined to reach the land of Cockaigne . Up there it lies , at the top of the greased pole , the land where the cocks lay golden eggs and the houses are built of sugar , where the streets are paved with blocks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buttered geese fall roasted and ready to eat from the sky , with knife and fork already stuck in them . " " There he goes ! "  | " Look at that man climb ! " " Come on , ladies and gentlemen , let 's hear the ring of your con-tributions . " " He 's slowing down . He 's slipping ! " " Ah , yes , ladies and gentlemen , it 's easy enough when you start life . But as you go on , it becomes more and more difficult . That pole is thirty-five feet high . Calculate every foot of it to equal two years of life , and we see that our contestant is now fifteen feet up and therefore thirty years old . And now he 's climbed five more feet and he 's forty years old . And his strength is going fast ! " Indeed , the contestant had started to slip and was holding on now with an effort that involved every part of his body , even his eyelashes . Tallow got mixed into his dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's getting , " the barker shouted . " His hair has already turned gray . " For a while the young man flailed about like the previous contestant , trying every means of keeping his hold and exhausting himself in maneuvers . But finally he managed to bring ashes between the inside of his thighs and the pole and suddenly realized that by this trick he could hold on best and at the same time prepare for his thighs a new plaster of ashes further up . " Ah , there 's a man with talent ! " the barker shouted . But the plaster of ashes did n't always hold . Down below , previousclimbers had worn off much of the grease , but here , up high , so few climbers had come that the grease lay thick on the wood and no amount of ashes would hold . And the climber began to slip . But what a struggle he put up ! How he fought that tallow and the soap , until he brought his ribs against the wood with such desperate strength that he stopped sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the mast the climber was motionless , stuck there like a fly to a ceiling , his arms and his legs wrapped for dear life around the pole , and the only thing that moved was his torso , pumping air as visibly as a pair of bellows , and so loud that in the silence one could hear the wind whistling through the passages to his lungs . No one dared move . No one dared say a word . The only other noise in the crowd was the soft sobbing of a woman who stared up with tears running down her cheeks.  |p183Then  suddenly the fly moved . It was almost as if he had gatheredhimself for a leap upward and had just been waiting for the tiredness to drain out of his muscles . His fingers just managed to crook around the wreath of laurel on top , and then his body started to slither down , slowly pushing a growing mound of foul grease , soap and ashes ahead of him . " I won ! " he cried . " A victor ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the mop of hair . " Here 's your gold louis . And here 's the bowl of coins contributed by the generous public of Paris , always quick to salute and reward effort and ability . " The crowd applauded , and the young man said , " I do n't know where to put the money . Catherine ! Hold out your shawl and let Monsieur empty his bowl into it . " " What is your name , young man ? " " Alexandre Dumas . " " Ladies and gentlemen ! I present to you a future hero of France : Alexandre Dumas , who will someday be richer than Lafitte and Rothschild . " With that he dismissed the winner and went back to business . His assistant gave the pole a new mopping of tallow and soap , and a new wreath of laurel leaves was placed on top . And the barker held up before the crowd another golden louis which was to he the prize for the next contestant . And Alexandre moved away with his pretty blonde companion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb a greased pole ! " she shouted at him . " But I won ! I won ! " " Good , so you won ! And now what ? You ca n't even put on your clothes , you 're that filthy . " " I won ! I showed them I could do it ! " " Just look at you ! Smeared black and white , and smelling to high heaven of the foulest grease . " " What do I care ? As long as you 're beside me , and you smell like a garden of flowers , and you look like an angel . " " Do n't touch me ! Keep away from my dress with your greasy hands . "   " I 'm not going to touch you . I 'm just making a gesture . A gesture of love . " " Well , make your gestures in the other direction . And do n't walk so close . Imagine being seen with a man who looks as if he had just escaped from Charenton . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . Do n't worry . I 'll see you home . " " Then you love me . Now at last I have the proof . " " I do n't love you at all . I just pity you . " " Then I must be satisfied to be pitied . It 's still something . All I 'm afraid of is indifference . " " I 'd do as much for a dog . " " Good . Then I 'll be your dog . " And he fell on all fours and trotted behind her , barking . " Stop it ! " she cried . " Stop it ! " " Promise to wash me when we get home ! r'Wash you ! You 're mad ! "  --  f " But in your room you have a stove and a kettle and you can make hot water . I ca n't . " " Very well , I 'll make you hot water . Only stop being a dog , for the love of Heaven ! " " You 'll iron my trousers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll press your trousers . " " I knew you would n't abandon me completely . And what are you going to do with all that money ? " " What money ? " " The money you won . Because I certainly did n't climb that pole for myself . " " Do you think I need money that badly ? " " Then let me buy you a present . " " Better buy yourself another pair of trousers . " " Say what you please . But now at last I shall see the inside of your room . " " What makes you think that ? " " Why , to wash myself . " " Nothing of the sort . I shall heat the water and put it outside for you . " " You mean I got myself dirty all for nothing ? "   " So it was just another trick ? Like your scratching and miaouing the other night thinking I 'd open up for a poor kitten . " " Why wo n't you let me into your room ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to breathe the air you breathe . I promise to behavemyself . " " Oh , sure . Like the last time we went dancing when you promised not to try to kiss me . " " But I was n't trying to kiss you . " " Then what was it you were trying to do ? Eat me ? " " I just wanted to have my face close to yours . " " You certainly did . So much so that I thought I was going to suffocate . I could n't breathe . That 's how you keep your promises . A person is a fool ever to believe a single word of yours . " " Oh , that 's not fair . What do you know of the struggle I put up inside myself . Have you any notion of what it means to see you day in and day out and not  --  and not squeeze you to death in my arms ? You do n't have to see yourself . How lucky you are . You have no idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all very well for you to talk of promises . . . but it 's I who has to keep them and see you at the same time . If I were blind , yes , and deaf too so I could n't hear your voice . . . and had no arms ... " " How you talk . And two nights ago when you had tickets to the Theatre Francais , off you went with your fine friends , with no more thought of me ... " " But you would have been bored to death . A tragedy . A long , dull tragedy in verse by Baour-Lormian , whom everybody calls BalourdDormant , because you fall asleep during his plays . . . " " You think I care with whom you go to the theater ? I just wanted you to understand that I 'm nobody 's fool . " " So you think I 'm trying to make a fool of you ? Is that what you think ? " " No . Just that you exaggerate . And how you exaggerate !  --  Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . I do n't want the porter to see us together in this condition . " " No . You go . After the porter opens for you , only pretend to close to door . Leave it open a crack and I 'll dash through and close it myselfwithout being seen . "   " And I have your promise that you will wait in your room until I bring the hot water into the hall ? " " It would be so much easier if you would let me lift the kettle . . . " And so it would go . On and on . Night after night . The struggle to keep him out of her room . And each night her defenses crumblinga bit , until at last , on one excuse or another , he had managed to enter . And after that he was perpetually in or out . Ike had forgotten a book . His last candle end had been consumed . He had a splinter in his finger . Or no excuse at all . Just entering and throwing himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stifling ! " " Is that what you came to tell me ? At this hour ? When I 'm just about to go to bed ? " " Well , yes , that 's all . Except that you 're ravishingly beautiful . I really must write a poem to you . " " Good . Go and do that . I 'll sleep , while you write . " " Yes . And I will too . But you 'll permit me to sit down for a secondand rest ? " " You 're sure it will be only a second ? " " However long it will be  --  it will seem but a second to me . " " Oh , I knew that once you were in my room there would be no driving you out , " she would say . " Why should you want to drive me out ? Have I misbehaved myself ? Am I so obnoxious to you ? " " I need some privacy . After all , I 'm a woman . And I 'm getting ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " do n't stand on ceremonies . Just tell me to turn my back or shut my eyes . I assure you I wo n't peek . My word of honor . " " Well , I 'm telling you to get out . Whose room is it anyhow ? " " Oh , so it 's come to that . Very well , if it 's a matter of who pays the rent . . . " " Must you always misunderstand me ? I 'm not really chasing you out , I 'm just pleading . I 'm just begging for a little consideration . Just a little . " And then when he 'd finally leave and she would go to bed , she'dP187wake up at night to discover him sitting at her table reading by her candle . " Ohl Where did you come from ? " " From my room . There 's no air there . Your room is on the street and the air is so much fresher . I really did n't think you 'd mind . Do you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning . I have no idea . " " And you have n't been to bed yet ? " " No . I have this volume I want to finish . " " Ah , well , you may be able to exist without sleep . But I need my sleep . I have work to do tomorrow . Please go back to your room . " " What difference if I 'm here ? You were sleeping for hours while I was reading . And it seemed to me I was your guardian angel . Go on , go back to sleep . " " But I ca n't fall asleep with you in my room . " " Very well , then let me read to you . " And he 'd come over to her bed and read . " Listen to this  --  it 's Ronsard , Pierre de Ronsard : ' Quand vous serez bien vieille , au soir , a la chandelle ... " " Ca n't you sit on the chair ? " " Of course , if you insist . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist . Is n't it natural that you should sit on a chair ? " " Why natural ? " " Why ? Because this is my bed . " " Well , I 'm not taking it from you . " " Yes , but  --  Oh , you drive me to such fury ! " " How so ? " " Because . . . because ... well , to speak clearly , with my bed it 's just the same as with my room . Bit by bit you 're pushing yourself into it . " " Ah , you 're crying . What is there to cry about ? I 've done nothing , surely . " " No , no , nothing at all , " she 'd sob . And she 'd continue to sob softly while he read on : " ' Regrettant ' ton amour et vostre fier desdain .. : " And so it would go until finally it did not surprise her to wakeP188one morning and find him curled up on her bed still in his clothes , but his cravat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning . Her frugal soul , deeply offended , reached out to snuff it out , unaware of how much she was exposing herself . " You 've put out one fire and kindled another , " he said and caught her around . " Stop it ! " she cried . " Let me go ! " " Ca n't I even have my arms around you ? " " No , stop it ! " " But you 've been in my arms often enough . When dancing , for example . " " Please ! Surely there 's a difference when we are out dancing ... " " What difference ? A paltry few thicknesses of cloth ? Is that such a difference ? Do n't you think when we dance that I can feel your heart beating through your dress ? And smell the lovely smell of your perspiration . " " Oh ! I say ! Is that what you think of when you 're dancing ? " " Why , what do you think of ? " " Really , you 're impossible . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the way I am . Besides , it 's you who bring such ideas to me . They never occur to me when you 're not around . " " I 'd like to be sure of that ! " " Would you really ? Then I give you my word . My word of honor . Now despise me because my spirit is weak and you make my senses whirl . Despise me ! " " All I 'm trying to do is ask you to behave yourself . I do n't want to despise you . Why do you always jump to extremes ? " " All right . I 'll behave . What must I do ? " " Keep your hands off me . That 's the first thing . " " Very well . There . Are my hands off ? " " All right . Now go back into your room . " " Not before you promise to go out dancing with me this eve-ning . " " Yes , yes . Only go . " And that 's the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made himself at home there , he began to force himself into her bed and make himself at home there . And then there wasp189only one more step : to force himself into her embraces and make himself at home in her body . How often she resisted . And how often she called a halt and drew another line beyond which he was not to dare go . And then finally there were no more lines that could be drawn . She wept . She wept and was inconsolable . And he vowed hereternal affection and begged her pardon a thousand times . " I did n't want another lover , " she moaned . " But surely you do n't want somebody who dos n't love you ? " he said . " I 've had lovers . I 've had them . And it 's only one heartbreak after another . " She wept bitterly . " I wanted a husband . I wanted a hus-band . " " But you 're married . " " Oh , stop that . You know I 'm not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I do . How can I help myself ? When I was living with a man I could n't very well call myself Mademoiselle . " She sobbed on . " But when he left you  --  or you left him  --  why did n't you call yourself Mademoiselle again ? " " Suddenly call myself Mademoiselle ? After telling everyone I was married ? Are you crazy ? " " Well , what was I to believe when I first met you ? And what am I to believe now ? Shall I accept what you want others to believe , or only what you want me to believe ? " " Oh , that shows how little you really love me . " " You know that 's not true . You know how much I love you . " " Then why ? Why wo n't you marry me ? Oh , you need n't answer . I know . " " What do you know ? " " Why should you marry me ? What more have I got to give you ? I Iave n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . Why should you pay extra for what you have already . " " Do n't be bitter , Catherine . It clouds the beauty of your eyes . We love each other . We have years of happiness ahead of us . I 'll never leave you . " " I wish I could believe that . But I know better . I 'm nothing butP190an address . Number 1 , Place des Italiens . And all your love is the convenience of a girl living across the hall . A girl not too bad lookingand dancing not too badly , and who will do until you move to another address . . . or there 's someone who dances better or looks prettier . " " Oh , you 're cruel ! " " I 'm cruel ! I like that . And yet you 're wrong not to marry me . Yes you are , Alexandre . I would make you a good wife . Precisely because I 'm not good enough for you . " " Do n't say such things , Catherine . Who am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , you have fine friends . And you have prospects . And I 'll never be anything but a fool and a seamstress . But just because I 'll never be anything else , you 're wrong not to marry me . Because with me you 'd always have someone who was satisfied just to trim your hair and boil your eggs and surround you with sympathy and with comfort and make no demands on you .... " He knew she was right . But he knew too that this garret was not to be his world for very long . He was writing comedies like mad , one-act curtain raisers , and while they were all being turned down , someday one of them would be accepted , and then he would be a totally different person , moving in a totally different world . " Marry me , " she would say to him again and again . " Oh , I know you wo n't . But just listen to my reasons , so that years from now you can remember what I told you and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married her . With me you will have someone who will never be a millstone around your neck . I can earn my own living and even if necessary a bit of living for you . It will be good , when you are running your chances out in the big world , to know that you have a cushion that you can always fall back on , a home you can always rely on , and a good soup always on the fire . And that no matter how high you rise and how jealous people may be of you , there will always be one friend who loves you for yourself alone . " " You 're delightful , " Dumas said , laughing . " Really delightful . First one ca n't get you to open up your door to let one in , and now one ca n't open the door the other way to let oneself out . " " Ah , so you 're thinking of that already ? "   " No ! Of course not . I 'm thinking of nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . Supremely happy . What I 'm pointing out is that it is you who have changed . From the first moment I heard your voice through that door , I knew that I wanted you . And that 's something you ca n't deny , can you ? " " No . " " No . You ca n't . But you  --  you 've changed . And instead you accuseme of changing . I ask you , Is that right ? " " Very well , so I 'm wrong . But still you do n't understand how I feel . I want a husband , not a lover . Marry me , marry me . And you know what ? You really want to know what ? " " What ? " " Do n't you think I see you when you think I 'm not looking ? Do n't you think I see you when your eyes go to other girls ? But I do n't care . Really I could take that too , if you would marry me . No woman could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will snare you , and she 'll be jealous and make your life miserable . But I wo n't . I promise you . Just so I can know that you 'll always come back to me . That I 'll always have some of you at least some of the time . " And so she 'd plead and they 'd argue and finally he would drown all this talk in his kisses , and then while she slept off the drunkennessof love , he , as if love , on the contrary , were no more to him than u cup of coffee , would get up and turn to his books . And then , wakingin the morning , often she 'd find him exactly where she had seen him when she fell asleep . And at other times , curled up , half naked , on top of the covers , asleep in his kind of sleep , a greedy kind of rest , his nostrils taking in the air in great scoops , as if he could make up for his lost sleep by sleeping three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him in infinite tenderness . And she 'd shake her head with the fear and the sorrow that surely she must soon lose this big , friendly , impetuous dog . And she 'd kiss him softly and whisper , " I 'd like to let you sleep , lover , but my day begins so early . My helpers will soon be here . " But not a sign from him . Dead to the world . She 'd kiss him again , becoming more impatient . " Go . Go to your room , lover . " Silence . Except for the noise of his steady breathing . P192Then she 'd raise her voice . " Do you hear me ? Get up ! " And she 'd push him . At first gently . Then more rudely . And then , when that seemed to have no effect on him , she would tug and shove him . But nothing would rouse him and all her strength somehowseemed to ebb before his bulk . And then as the minutes passed and her situation became ever more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her fists . " You devil , you ! Wake up ! Wake up and get out ! " But force made no more impression on him than kindness . " Up ! Up ! " He stirred finally beneath her blows . " Oh , it 's you . " And he would yawn and wrap his arms around her . " No , no ! " she would cry , struggling to escape . " It 's daylight . It 's too late for that . " But he was too powerful . She could not free herself from his strangling embrace . " Imbecile ! " she would mutter in her fury . " In a minute they 'll be here ! " It was as if he were deaf . And perhaps even still asleep . For his eyes continued closed , and only his body forced itself upon her . " My dress ! Let me at least . . . Oh , you beast . Leave me be . Faugh ! You disgust me ! " Neither her reasoning nor her anger mattered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of a moving van rushing downhill on one of Paris 's steep cobblestoned streets . Then she stopped resisting and took the opposite course , trying to bring the matter to a quick conclusion . Which was precisely so it seemed to her , when , as if to increase her exasperation , he became deliberate . Her fire outdistanced his and , gasping for breath , she choked and cried and struggled , until at last it was over and , worn out , her body begging once again for sleep , she had still nevertheless to chase him from her room , adjust her rumpled clothes and get herself ready for the day 's work . And he ? In a moment , dressed , his face bathed and his hair plastereddown as well as it would go , he would step light and fresh into her workshop , where three women were now busily sewing , and he 'd say cheerfully , Bonjour , Mesdames . Did the heat botherP193you last night ? " And he would smile and jest and leave for his office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forceful , ardent , mad . But somehow deep down always unruffled , always sure of himself , like the bottom of the ocean in a hurricane . And she going from tears to cries of joy , from protestations to pleas . " I have neither husband nor a lover , " she would say . " What ? You dare say this to me ? To me who worship every spot on your body ! " " Yes , but love , real love , that 's something else . " " Ah , so you will teach me about love . I who have studied love in the Song of Solomon , in Ovid and in Shakespeare . " " Yes . Because all you know is passion . Not love . " " So ? And what , pray , is the difference ? " " The difference ... " " Go on . Why do you stop ? " " I stop because you 're not listening . " " I 'm listening , I 'm listening . " " Then take your hands away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands bother you . Speak . I tell you I 'm listening . " " Yes , but how can I speak ... " " Oh , so now you admit that it 's not because I 'm not listening but because you are not speaking . " " Oh , God , you make life impossible . Why did you ever find your way into this house ? My life was so peaceful . . . . " " And will my going away make it peaceful again ? " " Yes , yes . Oh , no , Alexandre , no . " " Well , good . I 'm not going . I'rn not even thinking of it . No need for you to burst into tears . " " Oh , you make me so miserable . You destroy me . Sometimes I say to myself if only I had the courage I would kill myself . Or kill you . " " Promise me only one thing before you do . " " Yes . What is it you want besides my life ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandre , if only you understood . " " Understood what ? " " That I have so much love to give you . So much love . That 1P194would really give you my life . But you do n't understand that . You do n't understand what it is to give . Only to take . " " You mean you have nothing from me ? " " Oh , yes . Dancing , laughter , everything but real love . " " And what is real love , my darling . Go ahead . Instruct me . " " Sacrifice . " " " Sacrifice ? " " Yes . Sacrifice . " And thus it went on for months , until one night she said to him , " You know something ? " " What ? " " I 'm making a baby . " " You 're what ? " " I 'm making a baby . Do n't you understand French ? " He jumped to his feet . " Are you sure ? " " Of course I 'm sure . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My baby ? " " Do you imagine , " she asked , " that I 've been deceiving you ? When I 've scarcely had time to blow my nose , what with your arms around me every moment I can call my own . " " My baby ! " Dumas said ecstatically . " What do you propose to do ? " she asked . " A boy , " he said , his face glowing . " A boy . It will be a boy . " " Either that , " she said matter-of-factly , " or else a girl . One or the other . " " A boy , " he kept repeating . " My boy . " " All right , " she said . " So what ? " " So what ? Is that how you look at it ? How can you take it so lightly ? " He scolded her . " I take it lightly ? " she screamed . " I ? It is you ! I 'm asking you , What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be my son , " he said . " Does n't that mean anything to you ? " Furious , she shouted at him , " That 's not the question . The question is , what does it mean to you ? " " Ah , you ask ! You ask that of me  --  Alexandre Dumas , a father . " " Then we shall be married ? " " Ah ! So it 's just for that that you let yourself be caught ? "   " How dare you say so ! I trick you ? Is that what you really think ? " " No , no , no . Forgive me . Look , I 'm on my knees . I kiss your sweet body . Wait , I must run out and buy you a basket of fruit ! " And before she could stop him he was out of the room and rushingdown the steps . And then what happened was this : just at the time the baby was expected his own mother decided to give up her little business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm no longer young , " she wrote to her son . " I get dizzy spells now and then . Doctor Rabail tells me that I should n't work at all any longer . If I sell this business and whatever else I own in this town , I will have two or three thousand francs  --  enough , I daresay , to keep us alive for three or four years , counting in your own earnings . And from then on , we must pray to Cod that you will either make a good marriage to some rich girl or that you will have a success in your career . " And thus , at the very time the midwife was coming to help CatherineLebay bring a boy in the world a wagon was coming to take away Alexandre 's furniture . He and his mother were going to live together at Number 53 , Faubourg St. Denis . " Is n't it terrible that things should happen just this way , " he said to Catherine , " and that instead of being at your side in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , superintendingthe moving , and doing a thousand things . " And she said nothing . You are angry with me ? " " Disappointed is the word , " she said . " I ' 11 be back as soon as I can . " " No doubt , " she said . " You do n't think for one moment that I 'm abandoning you . " " No , " she said curtly . " Oh , come now , " he said , " you really do , but just do n't want to any so . " " Well , suppose I did think so . " " But it would n't be true ! " he cried . " How could I be so loath-some ! " " Alexandre , " she said , " somehow you always manage to do what you want even while denying it . "   " But I will see you every day . Nothing will be changed . " " Yes , no doubt . But I 'm sure of one thing . " " What ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  about us . Not one word . " " Ah , but that 's easily explained , my darling . My mother is getting on in years . And she 's ill . One ca n't break news of this kind to her just like that . It might be a shock . She 's counting on me to support her in her old age . She 's figuring on my marrying into some rich family . " " Yes . Of course . But I was right , was n't I ? Your mother knows nothing . That 's all I wanted to know . " " Darling , I must run now . But I 'll be back this evening . Or certainlytomorrow morning . " " Why not this evening ? " " My mother again . It will be her first evening in Paris . I ca n't very well leave her . I 've got tickets for the theater for her . I want her to make acquaintances quickly and thus create the best possiblesurroundings for her . Besides , that will leave us more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you really ? " " Yes . ' " Then give me a kiss ! " And thus a couple of days later , on the last day of July 1824 , following the regulations of Article 55 of the Napoleonic Code , an officer of the " civil estate " climbed the steps to the top floor of Number1 , Place des Italiens , in Paris and verified the existence of a newborn child . Sex : male . The mother , pale , languid , happy in the subdued , ethereal way of women who have just given birth , lay propped up , dressed in her blue lying-in gown , and watched the man as he unfolded a port able desk from crossed straps around his shoulders so that the writ ing surface protruded from his waist and he spread out on it his papers , his pen , his ink and drying sand . He asked her the usual questions about her name , her family , her marital state . She told him that her name was Catherine Lebay , that she had been born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all down , in triplicate , and then he explained to Mademoiselle Lebay that the Napoleonic Code recognizedonly two kinds of births : legitimate and illegitimate , and that since she was unmarried this birth was not legitimate and therefore it must be illegitimate . " Do you understand ? " the official asked . " Yes , " said the pale lips quietly and turned to smile at the child lying in her arms . " Illegitimate . I understand . " " That means , " the official went on , " that the father is unknown . " " Oh , no , " said Catherine . " I know who the father is . He is  --  " " Pardon me , " the clerk said quickly , " but it is none of my businesswho you happen to think the father is . The father is still un-known . " " But I tell you , he is known . I know it and he knows it . And he will be here later and will himself acknowledge it . " The officer shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused herself . " Why do you insist , when I tell you  --  " " My dear lady , " said the clerk , " do n't you think I know my business ? Before one can have a position such as this one must know the Civil Code by heart . And I can tell you that the Code Napoleon specifically , in Article 340 , forbids the right of recherche de la paternite , the search for fatherhood . Do you understand ? " " But if the father himself ... " " Please . I see you still do not understand , or refuse to understand . According to the code , a woman has no right to name the father of her child . " " No right to name the father of her child ? " Catherine Lebay exclaimed . " That 's right . " " How ridiculous ! Every child has a father  --  and who should know better than the mother who the father is ? " " Undoubtedly . But that 's not for the law . The law presumes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father is the husband , whether actually so or not , or that the woman is unmarried , in which case there is no proof of who the father is , and if she chooses she may say the father is the King of Spain , and obviously the law can not put down here on paper what can never be proved to be true or false . Now is that clear ? "   " Well ... " " You see , this paper is a legal paper . And what I put down here would have to be accepted in every court of France . And if this paper were to say , here , that the father of your child is the Marquis de Carabas , then when the Marquis de Carabas dies , your son could go to court and collect his inheritance . Now perhaps you are beginning to see why I have to put down here father unknown ! " " Yes . . . " " Can you imagine what a state of affairs we would have in this country if every woman who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was ? A fine confusion that would be ! And what an opportunity for lies ! " " Yes , " said Catherine meekly , " I guess it would be . " " Good . Well , now that we 're over that , let 's get on to the next point . Now follow me carefully . Illegitimate births are divided into three classes : simple , adulterous and incestuous . Simple is the name for those births where father and mother , both unmarried , are willingand free to marry and legitimize the whole situation . Now , is that the case here ? " Catherine closed her eyes . Lines of pain and bitterness appeared in her face for a moment , and then she shook her head . " No . It 's not that simple . " " Good . Then we have only the two other possibilities : adulterous and incestuous . Now if you say incestuous , then this is the one case where the law makes an exception and permits you to name the father so that judicial proceedings may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if you say no , then you must say the child is the result of adulterous ... " Catherine was tired . Her head was swimming . " Yes , " she said . " Yes , what ? " " Adulterous , " she whispered . " I have only one more question , " the clerk said . " What name willthe child bear when he is christened . Christian names only , please . " " Alexandre , " said Catherine softly , and she turned toward hernursling and planted a long kiss on his flushed scalp , which exudedan odor that was divine and of which she could never breatheP199enough . Tears dropped from her eyes and rolled down across the baby 's pink head , on which the faintest fuzz of hair appeared . The officer rose , folded up his little portable desk , and after havingthe nurse and the porter sign as witnesses , he handed Catherine a copy of the birth certificate , collected from her the cost of the stamp tax , and left . And that 's how little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adulterous union between a mother unknown to the Memoirs and a father unknown to the civil records . CHAPTER FIFTEENThe Invincible StomachNo MATTER how shamefully Dumas may have treated his little family , I must insist that he was fundamentally a kindhearted man . A very kindhearted man . Take , for example , his behavior toward Bourriquet , a process server . During a period when Dumas was bedeviled with one lawsuitafter another , and almost daily being served with another summons bringing him that much nearer to debtor 's prison , there was no sight that he hated more than that of this knuckle-headed and barrel-chested individual who seemed to be constantly lurking outside Dumas ' home waiting for an opportunity to force another paper into his hands . And then one day someone came around with a collection sheet and asked Dumas to make some little donation toward the burial of an unfortunate man . " Why , it 's for Bourriquet ! The process server , " Dumas exclaimed , reading the name at the top of the sheet . " Yes , it is . Died yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " How could he die so suddenly ? Why , I saw him only the other day looking so well ! " " Stood in the rain outside a brothel for hours waiting for a man whom he had to serve with a summons . Caught his death of cold . " " Why did n't he go inside ? "   " In a brothel ? While on official duty ? " " You 're right , " said Dumas . " Brave type . Died in the line of duty , like a soldier . " " Yes , indeed . I trust you will be generous , Monsieur Dumas . " " How much will it cost to bury him ? " " Third-class funeral : sixty francs . " " Here 's a hundred and twenty , " said Dumas . " Bury another process server with him . " That 's the way he was : open , generous , free . So that his very hate had a way of transmuting itself into something rich and warm , almost an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , like Dumas , accompaniedGaribaldi on his Sicilian expedition , dub him the " gentle giant . " But just as one would be foolish to go to Niagara Falls to rinse a teacup , where it would more likely be smashed than washed , so one should n't expect even a gentle giant to make the sort of homelovinghusband and father that most women want . Just picture to yourself one of Dumas ' visits to his old garret . First there 's the excitement of the reunion and the greetings and then the hundred little stories about the little boy 's progress , pottychairanecdotes , matter of teething or learning to walk or talk or read or count , depending on the stage he has reached ... . And then what ? Well , one ca n't be forever discussing infants . And infants have to be put to sleep fairly early . And thus , in the darkened room there would ensue such angrily whispered conversations as this : " Stop it ! " And then again : " I said stop it ! Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , after all ... " " After all is exactly what I mean . After all the trouble that I 've been to , putting him to sleep , I do n't intend to have him wakened . " " Just gently then . Very gently . " " Oh , sure , gently . How well I know your gentlies . One gently from you and look at me now . " So , in time , Dumas would get up and want to light a candle end and read . " Do n't you dare strike a light ! "   " Well , what in the devil 's name shall I do with myself ? " " Ca n't you lie in bed and sleep ? What 's the matter with you anyhow ? Must you either be tearing into a woman or tearing into a book ? " " I 've got to be doing something . I ca n't just twiddle my thumbs from now until dawn . " " Sleep is something to do . You can sleep for a change . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! On the contrary , sleep is nothing . Sleep is a hole in one 's life . Sleep is the finger of death poking itself forward before his time . I refuse to sleep ! " " Of course you refuse to sleep . You ca n't sleep . Not after the meal you packed away . " " What do you mean by that ? " " I mean you gorge yourself , that 's what . And naturally you ca n't sleep . Who could ? With a bellyful of indigestion . " " Me , indigestion ? Why , I do n't even know the meaning of the word . I 've got a constitution of iron . I digest anything and everything . I eat because I 'm hungry and I work because I 'm full of energy . " It 's curious how often this indigestion theory crops up in order to explain the character of Dumas . Even Dumas fits raised it once when someone smilingly pointed out that his collected works were being issued in a dozen volumes or so , whereas no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's works , the nearest being the 292-volume set published by Calmann-Levy. *Dumas fill fell back on the indigestion theory to explain his father 's enormous output . " If I have n't written as much as my father , " he said , " perhaps it 's because I sleep so well at night , while my father would n't even bother to go to bed due to the violent stomach cramps with which he was afflicted . I myself saw him up many times at night , working away busily with both hands , one hand writing as fast as it could , while the other was massaging his belly and coaxing from deep within him one lugubrious belch after another . And yet he insisted lie was happy and that indeed there was no better way for him to forget his pains than by immersing himself in his work . " * It was still in print fifty years after Dumas ' death , but is now no longer available . P202Personally , I do n't think that indigestion will explain the creative powers of Dumas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strained relations with Catherine and his child . That he did have stomach cramps now and then is true enough . Dr. Gruby , who might be called his doctor ( though in all his life Dumas never really needed the services of a physician ) , once heard Dumas complain about his cramps . " Do you think , " Dumas asked , " that there might be something seriously wrong with me ? " " Let 's look into this , " Dr. Gruby suggested . " In what way ? " " Follow this diet , " said Dr. Gruby . " Three times a day have a meal of cold beef with an olive-oil dressing , a large cucumber salad and a big glass of milk . If you are hungry between meals take a cup of thick hot chocolate . Come and see me in a week . " Dumas followed the doctor 's prescription to the letter . As soon as he opened the door , a week later , at Dr. Gruby 's office , the doctor said to him , " Go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " moaned Dumas , " on the contrary , I 've got the same pains I had before . " " Did you follow my diet ? " " Religiously . " " Then you 're obviously as sound as a bell ! The mere fact that you could come to this office on your own two legs after the diet I gave you , a diet purposely devised to put an ordinary man at death 's door in three days , shows that you 're as strong as an ox . " Dumas sighed , rubbed his aching belly , and went home to work . He was indeed a tough man to kill . During the great cholera epidemic of 1832 , when Dumas lived on rue Saint-Lazare and could see between fifty and a hundred funerals passing his window every day , he wrote his gayest comedy , The Widow 's Husband , and consumed vast quantities of melons . Liszt threw up his hands in horror . " You idiot ! Melons are strictly forbidden ! " " I know , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love melons , and never have they been so cheap and so good .  --  Here , let me open up one for you ; you 'll see for yourself . "   " Not for me ! " Liszt said . His friends were convinced that they were seeing the last of Dumas , for during the epidemic fruit was the first thing that doctorslooked upon with suspicion , and above all , melons . Dr. Veron , a squeaky-voiced individual , rotund as an abbot , liked to think of himself not only as a doctor but as a financier , as well as a patron of the arts , and an artist too . He had some right to all these honors , since as manager of the Opera he first produced Meyerbeer 's Robert le Diable , and as owner of both a magazine and a newspaper he published Sainte-Beuve and such famous longwindedserials as The Wandering Jew and The Mysteries of Paris by Eugene Sue , and to cap it all himself wrote novels and memoirs . The doctor tells of a time when he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Sophie ( said to have been his first mistress ) , who was so proud of her culinary achievements that she would sit in a corner of the dining room and accept compliments from the guests . She resented Dumas ' fame as a cook , considering him an amateur and an upstart . And when accusations of plagiarism began to undermine Dumas ' reputation , she voiced the opinion that just as his books were ghostwritten , so his dishes were probably ghostcooked . Dumas was naturally deeply wounded . You might say what you pleased about his books , but about his cooking , that was another matter . Veron tells of meeting Dumas on the street one day carrying an enormous shopping basket . Dumas grabbed little Veron by the ann . " This time you do n't escape me , " he said . " You 're coming to have dinner with me . Now , what shall I cook for you ? Tell me , has Sophie ever made you a real bouillabaisse ? " " No , " Veron admitted . " Naturally not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men make for men . I tell you that until you 've tasted one of my bouillabaisses , you have n't begun to live . " So they went shopping together and Dr. Veron watched with rising incredulity as Dumas purchased oysters , mussels , prawns , lobsters , crabs , sea urchins , whelks , etc .   " All that goes into a bouillabaisse ? " Dr. Veron asked , already regretting that he had let himself in for this dinner . " You should take notes , " said Dumas , " as I do when I find a new recipe . Then you can explain it to your Sophie . Tell her that one must cook all this in a good dry wine . Ah ! Here is what I want : eels ! And squid ! Doctor , we 're in luck today . The market has just what we want . Roe ! Yes . Roe is wonderful in a bouillabaisse . And fish heads . We want lots and lots of fish heads . " " Fish heads ? " Veron squeaked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without fish heads a bouillabaisse is little more than a mouth rinse . You would n't want it for brushing your teeth . " After the fish heads , Dumas went over to the vegetable counters . He bought knob celery , parsnips , onions , garlic , tomatoes , parsley , oregano , dill , laurel , saffron , pepper , and so forth . " So much for the vegetables , " said Dumas . " Now we need something for flavor . " " You mean , " Veron exclaimed , " that so far you 've bought nothing for flavor ? " " My dear Veron , " said Dumas , " no doubt an ordinary cook  --  your Sophie , for example  --  would be satisfied , but the master cook reaches for the superlative ; he wants to gild the lily and perfume the rose . " " To be sure , " said Veron meekly . So they purchased some dense , spicy Italian sausage , some Parmesancheese as hard as rock , a little jar of the best and strongest Dijon mustard , and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dumas wondered , standing there with his loaded basket and resting one huge arm around Veron 's shoulders . " Think , doctor , think . " Veron , completely swamped , could n't think of a thing . But Dumas struck his forehead suddenly with the flat of his hand . " Mushrooms ! What about mushrooms ? " " Right across the way , " said Veron , " I see a mushroom vendor . " " A mushroom vendor ? " Dumas cried . " Do you mean to tell me that your Sophie buys commercial mushrooms , grown in some abandoned mine or dank cellar ? Shame on her . " P205Dumas signaled a cab . " To the bois ! " he cried , jumping in and hauling Veron in after him . " We 'll pick our own mushrooms . " " But picking your own mushrooms , " said Veron , " that 's risky . There are some similarities that only a trained botanist . . . " " Ho-ho ! " Dumas roared . " You say that to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian . " " But there are toadstools so dangerous that they kill in three minutes , " said Veron . " They contain an alkaloid that paralyzes the heart nerve . " " Just you leave everything to me , " said Dumas lightly . " None of your commercial mushrooms for me . Without taste ! How can an abandoned mine take the place of God 's woods ? " Once dismounted in the bois , Dumas pointed out an orange mushroom which , he said , was precisely the species indicated for a bouillabaisse . " That 's the girolle , " j he declared . " This is the girolle ? " Veron asked , picking one . " For Heavens ' sake , no ! " Dumas cried . " That 's the false girolle . It 's deadly ! " He snatched the mushroom from Veron 's hand and threw it away . " But it looks exactly like the one you picked , " Veron pointed out . " Of course it does . It 's almost impossible to tell them apart , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , good God ! " Veron cried . " How do you know you are not going to commit a great blunder ? " " Never fear , " said Dumas . " It 's the eye , " he went on , tapping his face just below that organ . " To a practiced eye there 's a . . . well , I do n't know how to describe it ... a touch . . . a je ne sais quoi .. . that makes every difference in the world . " " A je ne sais quoi ! " Veron shrieked . " Calm yourself , my dear doctor , " said Dumas , continuing to pick girolles . " Tenez . Here 's a real girolle and here 's a false one . Now look at them , side by side . " " They look exactly the same to me , " said Veron , ready to burst into tears . " Ah , yes , to you . But take a verse by Ronsard and a verse byDr . Veron was the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the chanterelle in English . P206Ponsard ,  --  would n't a real poet recognize the difference at once ? " Dumas tossed away the false girolle . " It 's all in the gracefulness . " Veron sweated . " Ronsard , Ponsard ! " he cried . " Poets ! Gracefulness ! Is that all you have to go on in a matter involving life and death ? " " That 's all , " said Dumas , " since color and shape are precisely the same , as you yourself noted . " " Only that the edible variety is more graceful ? " " Yes . Or the other way around , " said Dumas , busily gathering . Veron jumped . " What do you mean the other way around ? Do n't you yourself know which is the more graceful ? " " Oh , come now , doctor , you know better than to get into a battle over aesthetics . Some connoisseurs think the poisonous girolle is the more graceful ; others hold that on the contrary it is the edible variety that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , shall we quarrel over this ? Is n't it enough that there should be this subtle difference ? Need we settle the question of which school of taste is right ? As a scholar you know yourself thatde gustibus et coloribus non est disputandum . " Veron was ready to die . Of course the bouillabaisse had finally to be eaten and proved to be divine . But Veron tells , in his Memoirs , how he asked a servant if he could not find for him a little phial with a cork . When the article arrived , Veron delicately spooned a little of the soup into it , corked it securely , and put it into his pocket . " Ah , " said Dumas , looking up from his sixth serving , " Dr. Veron is taking a sample of our bouillabaisse to his Sophie . " " No , " said Veron sharply , " that is not my intention . I just happen to have a patient with warts , whom so far I 've been unable to help . " And a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered a new materia medica . " I have added it to my pharmacopial armamentarium , " he declared . " Just a drop placed with great circumspection on the wart will cause it to slough off overnight . Beware , however , of any excess fluid as it will remove the skin too . Down to the bone . As to the effects of this Ronsard was a great poet of the seventeenth century , Ponsard a mediocre one of the nineteenth . P207new medicament when repeatedly taken internally , for that I 'm watching our friend Alexandre Dumas , and I will have a report to issue on the matter in due time . "  --  I take all this with a grain of salt . It is the jealousy of two impresariosboth fighting to be the most talked-about character of mid-nineteenth-century Paris . But the truth is that Dumas had basically sound ideas on nutrition , as anyone can discover who will consult his huge cookbook . He believed , for example , very strongly in the eternal pot , la marmite eternelle and bemoaned the passing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove and was never washed or emptied , claiming that by this method of cooking , in which meat or fowl , vegetables and herbs , were kept simmering in a liquor that was never changed and constantly added to as it diminished , no nutritious principles were ever lost , and as a result health and hospitality were both reinforced . The greatness of France , he categorically claimed , lay in the old eternal pot that produced a bold , healthy and virile race , alas now sadly in decline . THAT A MAN COULD LIVE so public a life as Dumas and still have hismost intimate acquaintances dispute the question of whether he was a lifelong sufferer from indigestion or not demonstrates how difficult it is to pass a final judgment on people . In the matter of his family one fact must be stressed : Catherine continued to raise her son to admire and respect his father . And the little lad grew up fully convinced that his father was the most marvelous father that ever was . Trailing at the hand of his mother , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tumbles , little Alexandre would say , " Papa could do that . " And his mother would agree at once . " Yes , with a mattress under him , " she would say , " there 's no trick your father is n't up to . "  --  Veron died a few years before his guinea pig . P208And if they passed a horse fallen to the cobblestones and saw the driver sweating to get the animal to its feet , Alexandre would boast , " Papa could get that horse up easily . " " More likely it 's on account of your father that the poor beast fell , " his mother would suggest . And little Alexandre would agree proudly . " Yes , Papa could push any horse over . Papa is strong . " None of this childish worship , incidentally , went to the mother . And why should it ? Mother was quite different . Mother was forever washing her little boy , combing him , scolding him . Mother would say , " Stop scuffing your shoes ! Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ? " Or else : " Blow your nose ! What will people think when they see a boy of your age with a runny nose ! " And she would pin a big square piece of sheeting to his blouse . " There . Now you 'll remember . I hope ! " What a torture that rough piece of cloth was , screaming to everyone , " I 'm a little boy who still has n't sense enough to blow his nose when it runs . " Yes , that was Mama . Mama forever after him to sit up straight . " You want to know why you keep having those ugly coughs ? Well , let me tell you . It 's because you 're always sitting all hunched up . " And to teach him to hold himself properly she would sew to the inside of the collar of all his blouses a little button . And whenever she looked up from her work and would see him sitting round-shouldered , she 'd say , " Button , button ! " And that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his chest and bring his neck back to where he could feel the button . " Ah ! That 's different . Now you 're feeling the button . One can see it . Now keep feeling it . " How different life was when Papa came ! His arms were full of bundles wrapped in newspaper , bundles which he would drop on the table in order to grab up his boy , run out with him onto the landing , and toss him high up in the air . " Up we go ! Up like a balloon ! " His mother would gasp and scream . Because there on the land ing the stairwell yawned .   " Ho-ho ! Silly Mama ! Is n't she a silly to think that we 're going to let our boy fall down those steps ! " " You can toss him in the room ! " " Not high enough . The ceiling is too low in the room . " " Must you toss him at all ? Is n't he getting too old for that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheeks when she was aroused . " As long as these arms can still toss , " Dumas would say , " I 'm going to toss him . That 's what God made fathers for , with big muscles : to toss their children . He gave fathers big muscles and mothers big breasts . God knew what He was doing . " As for little Alexandre , he was never frightened by the yawning steps . He was never afraid of anything when his father was around . Only when he was with his mother , then , at night , he would often wake up out of his sleep and scream with fear . After the tossing came the examination of all the packages that Papa had brought . Oh , the delight of opening Papa 's packages ! Always some new surprise ! It was as if every time Papa came to visit them it was once again New Year 's day , jour d'etrennes , day of gifts . There would be fruit and melons , and a cut of meat or fish , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put these away in crocks in the pantry , there would come the best part of all : the sweets , in little packages wrapped in striped or colored paper : sugared plums , or else dragees of almonds , or nougat , or  --  on rare occasions  --  delight of delights : rings of glaceed pineapple , about which father could tell stories of the distant tropics where pineapplesgrow , islands that rise up suddenly out of a warm blue sea like huge green gems . What stories Papa could tell : of men in prison and of sailors in shipwrecks , and of the time he had gone boar hunting . And the boar could be heard grunting deep in a thicket . Grunting like this : ugroink , ugr-groink . Papa could imitate every kind of animal ! And then of how fire was brought down from Heaven , and of the girl who was changed into a tree ... . Throughout the whole of his first six or seven years Papa 's stories were just like a golden haze surrounding little Alexandre . And from year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreP210streams of enchanting light , as if a fairy sun were rising out of banks of fog . " Is this a time for sweets ? " Mama would exclaim angrily , laying her hands on the striped paper packages . " Why , he did n't even finish his soup at lunch . " " You gave me too much soup ! " Alexandre would cry . " No one could eat so much soup . " " I 'll be judge of how much soup a little boy should eat , " his mother would declare . ( With Mama one could never say : " I do n't like this or that . " You had to finish what was on your plate . ) " Let him have at least one taste , Catherine , " Dumas would beg . Little Alexandre was already breaking into a wail , but his father secretly nudged him and gave him a big wink , while Mama went on : " Oh , well , if you 're going to take charge of him from now on , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . But be prepared to hold yourself available if he gets sick . That 's all I 'm saying . " And while they were arguing , Papa would slip little Alexandre a piece of candy which he had hidden in his hand . " Catherine , darling , please do n't flare up . These visits to see the two of you are my moments of purest joy . " " Then you 've nothing to do but make your joy permanent . All you have to do is tell your mother about us and we can all  --  " " Please , sweetheart . Believe me , we will yet be a little family . But if you knew how sick my mother is . From day to day the steps become more of a problem to her . She can barely get to the street once a day . And meanwhile I work and work . All last night I did not shut my eyes . I was up with Schiller 's Vershwoering des Fiesko . And tonight I must read Lessing 's Hamburgische Dramaturgie . Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original . " " Well , of course , if you must , you must , " Catherine would always say to such speeches . " Naturally , in that case you ca n't pay much attention to your family . Because there 's no lord like the High Lord Must . " " Let 's not squabble , darling , " Dumas would plead . " Let 's make this an evening of unalloyed joy , shall we ? " " Of course , " said Catherine . " But why not make every day a dayP211of joy ? Then you can not only feed him all the sweets you want but you can watch over him the next day when he has the colic or the fever . " But if the sweets roused Catherine , it was the toys Papa always brought that really drove her mad . " Another toy ? " she would say . " Why , how did you guess that that was just what this house needed most ? Somebody with less genius than you would have thought of the rent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered how I was going to get through the winter with holes in them , or he would have been bothered by the fact that charcoal has gone up three sous . But not my poet . No . He knows that all we need is anothertoy . Of course , this is a special toy , is n't it ? It 's a surprise for me ? If I shake it money will fall out ? You do think of everything , do n't you , Alexandre ? " And she 'd shake the toy , but of course without so much as a cent falling out . " There 's some trick to it , is n't there ? Here , you show me how it 's done , " and she 'd push the toy toward Dumas . " I 'll bet a fortunecomes out . And we can move out of this garret , where the child you adore does n't have the chance to grow up strong and healthy , as he would have , for example , in the sunny and roomy apartment where your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alexandre . I would never dream of taking your little darling boy in to see his dear grandmother . He 'll get along without a grandmother . But sometimes we walk past and we just dream . We can do that , ca n't we , Alexandre ? You 'll permit us to have dreams about a grandmother , wo n't you ? " " I do n't deserve that , Catherine , " Dumas would say . " Really I do n't . Everything will come to us if only we 're patient . Believe me when I say that I want nothing so much as to see you two living in a little cottage somewhere in the country . That would be nice , would n't it ? " " Wonderful ! Wonderful ! And it would be nice too if we could just pay the rent here . Perhaps you have a louis in your pocket ? " " Not a sou , Catherine . I 'm broke . I spent my last few francs on these gifts . " " Well , never mind , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit on the floor and play with your toys until the bailiff comes and throws us out . " And so the discussion would go on and on , with little Alexandre waiting patiently for the storm to blow over and for Papa to show him how to spin the new top , or how to make the little red monkey climb up the coconut tree . And Dumas would say to his son , " You must beg your mother to love your Papa a little bit more . Papa feels so sad because Mama does n't love him . " And Mama would give a great gasp and close her eyes as if in pain . " How can you do such a thing ? " she 'd whisper . " Deceiving your own son . " But little Alexandre understood only that his mother had been scolding his father and making him unhappy , just as she so often scolded him and made him unhappy , and he would beg , " Please , Mama , please be nice to Papa . " And Mama would turn away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage . " Tell her I want a kiss , " he would whisper to the boy . And Papa 's little confidant would go up to Mama and say , " Papa wants a kiss . Papa will be very unhappy until you give him a kiss . " There was no way to end this miserable comedy except by givingin and allowing Dumas a kiss , which he , with his insatiable carnal appetite , would greedily transform into a warm and promisingembrace . " Do n't swallow me ! " Catherine would gasp . " I 've got to breathe . " Not that this would completely end the dispute . For Catherine wanted to know just when she could count on some financial assistanceand how much it would be . " I have to know exactly how much I can spend on food , and exactly how much on clothing . Ca n't you understand that ? " And she would go into her old litany of complaints about what Dumas had done to her life . How , without him , her business would have grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty girls working for her , and a couple of men with handcarts delivering the finished work and bringing in fresh work . She might today he a woman of substance . Instead , here she was : a nothing and a no  --  P213body . The care of the child had prevented her from properly supervisingher business . Her helpers had gone into business for themselves and stolen away her customers from right under her nose . Now all she had was her needle , and not much work for it either . " And you ? You 're so helpful ! You spend your money on toys . " " Please , Catherine , do n't keep coming back to those toys . If only you knew how my thoughts go all week long to you and the boy , and of how I keep thinking , What can I bring that will delight the little youngster most ? And then , if in my week of hard work I manage to find a moment I can spare and come running here to receive those wonderful shouts of joy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwraps my little presents . . . Really , now , Catherine , how can you have the heart to begrudge me that pleasure ? " " How well you put it , Alexandre , " Catherine would say . " One would imagine that I spent all your money on gowns and furs and tickets for theater and ball . " " All my money , " said Alexandre reproachfully . " What do you mean ? The four francs and fifteen centimes that I earn a day ? And with which I must pay rent and feed four people  --  myself , my mother and you and my son ? And keep myself neat . For Monsieur de Broval inspects us again and again , and woe to the poor clerk whose linen is n't white and whose shoes are n't blacked . Nine hours it day I work at the office , and then I solicit copy work to take home for extra pay . Often I work all night copying music , invitations , documents . For pennies . Each time I buy a book I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ask you , how can I resist making a holiday of my visits here ? " Much of all this was at first far beyond little Alexandre 's understanding . But something of the tone in which it was carried on affected him like a sad song . It aroused in him a kind of undercurrent of dread , the great fear that his father would go away and never come back , and the feeling that if that happened it would he because his mother had chased Papa away . And thus there were those nights when , alone in the room with his mother , sleeping on n small mattress which was put on the floor at the foot of her bed , he 'd wake up and scream , " Papal Papal " And when his mother would rush to him and hold him in her arms and ask him what was the matter , he could only mutter in-P214comprehensible words and burst into tears . It was against the background of this dreary life that his father 's visits evoked from him such loud yells of joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And here Papa would take a hand himself , lecturing his mother on the right way to do things . For example , how to season a salad . No , no , Catherine . Heavens , no ! The oil first . You see , let me give you the science of it : everything  --  that is , every substance  --  has its own specificgravity , and the specific gravity of oil is lighter than that of vinegar . If you use vinegar first , then the salad is drenched with it , and when you add the oil , it just floats on top of the vinegar and rolls down into the bottom of the bowl . It is wasted . But if you use oil first , then the oil clings to your salad , and when the vinegar is added , it sinks through the oil to the salad itself , and thus every part of your salad will get the benefit of the seasoning . Do you understand ? " What an appetite one always had for father 's meals ! Such deliciousodors arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food was ready . Yes , father brought festivity into the home . Ordinarily one never ate anything except a vegetable soup made with bones and thin meat scraps , or else one had bread and cheese with watered wine . But with father dinner was an occasion . He liked to serve courses instead of piling everything on the plate at once , and he never insisted , as his mother did , that not one bit of food was to be wasted , so that it seemed as if the taste of food had no importance whatsoever . Father , on the other hand , wondered about each course , and sometimes , if a dish had n't succeeded , he would simply not eat it . " What am I to do with all this ? " Catherine would say when a vol-au-vent or a timbale had failed , and Dumas would set the platteraside . " What can you do with a failure ? " Dumas would say . " Throw it out , of course ! " " Throw it out ! " Catherine would exclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do with my five-act play on Ivanhoe ? I realized it was no good and I threw it out . " " We 'll eat this play , " Catherine said with flat emphasis . " We 'll be glad to have an act or two for dinner for the next couple of days . P215It may not be good enough for Monsieur the playwright , but our tastes are cruder . " And she would store it in the pantry , and little Alexandre knew he 'd be eating it for the next few days , good or bad . And with father too there was always dessert . Mother never served a dessert . Also , father liked to talk while eating , which made everything last longer . And he was full of stories . Mostly funny ones , because Papa thought that with food one should laugh . Sometimes he was so funny that even mother would laugh , and little Alexandre would pretend to understand so he would have the right to laugh too . " One must laugh while eating , " Dumas claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed at times as if father brought laughter into the house . And that when father left laughter went out along with him . And just before little Alexandre 's bedtime father would have still another story , one meant just for him . A story about a mother fish teaching her baby fish to swim without getting water up its nose , or else a story about a jinni in a bottle , or a story about grandfather , who was so strong he could lift a horse between his knees . Stories that were always suited to Alexandre 's age and that would go circling around in his mind for days , becoming part of his daydreamsand part of his nightmares and part too of his deliriums when he had a fever . What a joy to be put to bed by Papal And only one flaw in it , that one 's heart almost froze with the thought that maybe when one awoke Papa would no longer be home . Dumas would whisper to his son , " Why do n't you tell Mama to let me sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama you have a secret you want to whisper to her . " And then when Mama would come to kiss little Alexandre and to make him say his bit of a prayer , he would whisper to her , " Please let Papa stay overnight . " If there was anything that would infuriate Catherine it was this trick that he would play on her week after week . But what can one say in front of an innocent child ? " Do n't worry , " she 'd say . " He 'll sleep here all right . What else do you think he comes here for ? "   " Wonderful ! Wonderful ! " Dumas would say to his son . " Your mother still loves your father a little bit . Of course I 'll stay , and we 'll have another good story in the morning . And maybe  --  you know what ?  --  if you get up early , we 'll both go for a little walk together , just you and I , before I have to go to the office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even with his mother 's invitation and his father 's promise , little Alexandre was often pursued deep into his sleep by his abiding fear that he would someday see the last of his Papa , that someday his mother would have scolded Papa once too often about that Miss German or that Miss English , for whom it seemed Papa sometimes stayed up all night . Or perhaps mother would scold Papa just once too often for having bought his son another toy . Never , never did Mama think of buying him a toy . A hundred toy vendors might come along the street with the most wonderful toys in the world and his mother would just yank him along and say , " Just another silly and useless toy which your father will no doubt buy for you . " Still , there was something strange that the little boy observed for years without ever realizing just how strange it was , and that nevertheless made its impression on him : that though his mother did n't like his father , yet what a fuss she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit from him . After she had cleaned him up , she 'd warn him a thousand times to be sage , to behave , and she would refuse him sharply the permission to go downstairs and play with the little boy who lived in the rear of the courtyard . " You 're to play right here on the landing , you hear me ? And do n't you dare get yourself dirty . I 've worked hard enough gettingyou clean . " And then he 'd hear her filling the large tin basin in which slu took her stand-up sponge bath , as he could very well remember from the times before the day she saw him looking at her , when she snapped , " What are you looking at ? Tell me what you 're lookingat ! " After which she always put him out in the hallway before she got herself undressed . And then after her toilette , she would bring little Alexandre inP217and pass the brush through his curls once more , while the brush was still oily from the sweet-smelling brilliantine which she used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the table , her best dress on , with all the lace white and starched , and her good cashmereshawl around her shoulders , and the two of them would play lotto . It was the only game she ever played . And these were the only occasions . The little boy would often grow tired of lotto , but his mother would not let him have the scissors to cut up paper . " You 'll only be making dirt and I 've just got through cleaning . " Then he 'd want something to eat , but that too she 'd refuse . " No . You ca n't have anything to eat . Papa will be here and we 'll all eat together . " The hours of waiting seemed endless . Often it would become too dark to see the numbers on the lotto , but they 'd continue to sit in the gathering twilight , while outside one could hear the lamplightergoing along the street , and across the way lights twinkled on in the windows ... . And finally one would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . " He might at least have sent a commissionaire with a message , " Mama would say angrily . No , there was no escaping it . The evening of waiting was over and Papa was n't here . Mother would serve bread and cheese and milk , and neither of them would eat much . Then the nice clothes would be taken off and folded up carefully , and they would go to bed . And then sometimes , long after being put to bed , little Alexandre would be roused by peculiar noises . It was his mother making strange sounds in her throat , her teeth chattering , her breath comingand going audibly . And then a blowing of her nose . Those were the nights when a great sadness would come over the little boy , the sadness of the silent night , the sadness of a lonesomewalker ringing his heels down the empty street , the sadness of the distant cold sky with its sprinkling of stars , and then something even sadder , the thought of death , of not being allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to take a breath , and then having to submit to being shut up in a white box and putP218under the ground . And he would pull the covers over his face and cry softly to himself . And all the next day , even if the sun was shining , it would seem gray and long and dreary . It was at such times that his mother would often say , " You 'll drive me crazy with all your questions . Now leave me be . Go and play downstairs . " But , he wanted to know , Where is Papa ? " How should I know ? " " Is he with his mother ? " " No doubt . " " Does he have a mattress on the floor near her bed like I do ? " " That I 'd like to see ! " " Could we really go and see ? " " No , we ca n't . " " But you said you 'd like to see it . " " Yes , but we ca n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like your mother , that 's why . " " If we bought a lot of presents like Papa buys us , could we take them to her ? " " No , we could n't . " " Why not ? Would n't she even like us then ? " " Look child , once and for all , she does n't like us and never will . " " But why not ? " " We 're not good enough for her . Now do you understand ? She wipes her feet with our kind . " " Does n't she use a towel ? " " She 's too good for towels . " " But I 'll promise to be good too . " " Now you listen to me ! I want you to go downstairs right now and leave mother to her work . Now go on and play . " " I do n't feel like playing . " " What 's the matter ? Are you sick ? Let me feel your head . You are warm . Well , then lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make youa tisane . " And he would lie down on his mother 's bed while she brewed him a herb tea , and all manner of strange ideas about his father would crisscross his mind and leave him faint . P219He hated herb teas . And especially he hated having to drink them so hot that they almost burned his mouth . And afterward he would lie dreaming , perspiring , imagining how wonderful it would be if suddenly there would be a knock at the door , as sometimes indeed it would happen , deep in the night when both of them were asleep , a pounding and a deep voice shouting , " Open up ! Open up ! It 's me ! " Startled out of sleep , little Alexandre would burst into tears . And his mother would exclaim angrily , " Go away . This is no time to come visiting ! " " Visiting ? " Papa would cry through the door . " Visiting ? Is that what you call it when a father comes to see his family ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go away . I have to have my sleep . A customer is coming for a fitting tomorrow and I 'm not half done with the basting . And the boy has n't been feeling well either . " But the thought of his father going away without even being seen would bring renewed wails from little Alexandre and he would leap from his bed crying , " Papa ! Papa ! Do n't go away ! " " That 's right , my darling boy . Beg your mother for me ! Beg her to let me in ! " " Oh , Mama . Please , Mama ... " " All right . Hush , hush . But you get back into bed . What do you mean out on the cold floor with your bare feet ! Get back into bed at once ! " And then she 'd get out of bed herself , obviously very annoyed , and remove her bed bonnet and freshen her face with a damp cloth , and loosen the tight braids of her hair , which she had done up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same pretty blue dressing robe that she had sewn for herself years ago , for her lying-in . And she 'd open the door . Oh , what a world would come bounding into the room with Papa ! It was all the world of the Romantic Era that blew into that garret room with Papa . It was all the magic of that era of music and poetry , of art and invention , from the middle of the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth , an era for which a thou-P220sand critics in a thousand books have sought in vain for the right definition . Sought in vain because it was never so much a movement as a cry , part joy , part despair , part rebellion , wrung from the souls of millions . It was never , anyhow , so much a theory of art as it was a state of intoxication with life . It was man , the crippled god , born into a paradise forever just beyond his reach , assaulting the invincible gates of Heaven with the colors of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his genius . It was an era of defiance , an era of adventure , of heroism , of devotion unto death . And also the era of melancholia , of unrequited love , of a secret and cruel disease , of a gypsy prediction of dire fate . And stormy seas dashing themselves against rocky caverns , and nights in ancient forests , and moated castles stricken with a dark curse , and hovels of peasants embowered in roses and palaces where kings lay dying . The whole world , and all history , everything strange and wonderful , everything beautiful and terrible , strode into that room with Papa  --  bringing mother a bouquet of hothouse flowers , and for little Alexandre a music box . " Flowers ! " said Catherine . " Hm . How did you ever guess that I wanted nothing so much as flowers ? " " Catherine , my sweet , my lovely keepsake ... " " I suppose you have just come from your latest flame to whom you 've sworn some more of your undying love ? " " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than bullets come from lips as pretty as yours is too painful a paradox for me . " " What do you expect me to think when you come at three o'clock in the morning with useless presents in your hands ? What except that your latest mistress has just shown you the door ? " " Just because I did n't visit you last week ... " " Nor the week before ! " " Well , Catherine , yes , since you insist , I must make a confession to you . I have another mistress . "   " I knew it all along , my dear Alexandre , " she sneered . " You and your fine words , your grand promises ! " " Catherine ! Forgive me . " " Dumas kneeled before her . " Please . Listen to me . Let me tell you about my mistress . Awake or asleep , all I do is dream of her . Do you know that this room , or any room , no longer has four walls for me . Only three . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see darkness and in that darkness  --  faintly  --  row upon row , the faces of human beings . An audience . And up there  --  the boxes . And on the red velvet cushionslining the boxes I see the bare white arms of countesses , and behind them the dark figures of dukes and barons . Catherine , I can not even look at a candle but that it suddenly stretches out and becomes a whole row of footlights . The fireplace is no longer the fireplace . It is a prompter 's box . Yes , and I can even hear the prompter whispering . Hush ! Listen : Great Caesar fell . 0 ! What a fall was there , my countrymen ; then I , and you , and all of us fell down , whilst bloody treason flourished over us . ' And then comes it noise that is like no other noise in the world . First low and then rising like a hailstorm , like giant hailstones beating against the roofs of a whole city : the noise that only human beings can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to expresstheir approval and admiration . A noise that grows in volume and is penetrated by a cry that takes your heart as in a vise , the cry of Author ! Author ! ' Oh , Catherine , Catherine , this is my mistress ! And year in and year out I labor so that someday she will clasp me in her arms ! " He lay sobbing on the floor , while little Alexandre , utterly lost , howled with fright. ' i'IIE THEATER , yes , that was his mistress . Who had time for wife and child when Victor Hugo was crying , " Literature is our religion ! The theater is our church ! " And the young romantic writers were flocking to his standard to do battleP222against the entrenched classicists and especially against the statesupportedtheaters of Paris , the Theatre Francais and the Odeon , where nightly toga-clad actors went through the same old-fashioned classical dramas , reciting lofty thoughts in boring verses amidst an atmosphere of impeccable decorum  --  and to half-empty houses . " I bring you a new religion ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cromwell , with which he had hoped to beat down the doors of the state-subsidized theaters but had failed . " I bring you the grotesque  --  that is to say , the mixture of the sublime and the ridiculous which is characteristic of all human beings . " And his army of admirers shouted , " Down with literary despotism ! Freedom for the artist ! " While the classicists and the academicians only bolted the doors tighter and warned that if the rules of " good taste " and the three unities of Aristotle and Boileau ' were ever destroyed it would mean the revolution and an end to the purity and beauty of the French language . So Viennet , Arnault , Lemercier , Jouy , Andrieux continued to write their dull plays while the public groaned for something fresh . All Paris joined in this battle . For the theater was the beating heart of that city . Rich and poor were equally passionate about the stage . Where else but in Paris could it happen that when a theater ( the Porte-Saint-Martin ) was built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afraid that the building would collapse , the management could announce a free evening with the best performersof France , and though word got around that the poor were being used simply to test the soundness of the construction , they yet crowded in at the risk of their lives , sat on each other 's laps , filled the hall to the rafters , and proved that it would be amply safe for the rich ? Where else would rival singers such as Henrietta Sonntag and Maria Malibran split the Opera every night into hostile camps , each trying to outdo the other in the noise they produced after every aria and the length of their applause . And pity the poor partisan of Malibran who happened to be seated amidst a solid phalanx of Sonntag admirers ! And between the acts what arguments , what fin- " The famous three unities required a play to take place in twenty-four hours , in the same locality , and around a single main action . P223precations , what fisticuffs , what challenges to duels ! And after the performance still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other their greater devotion to their favorite diva , unhitching the horses of her carriage and drawing it through the streets with wild outcries . The Latin Quarter of Paris began to swarm with fierce-eyed bearded men in sailor 's hats of waxed leather , red satin vests and huge Spanish capes  --  men who looked more like pirates than writersor artists , men who swore lusty oaths , and in street brawls could be expected to account for themselves as experts in savate , able to knock a man out with a well-placed kick to the jaw . Men who expressedtheir enormous respect for women by making love to all of them irrespective of age or marital status . These were the men who laid the foundation for what was to be called the Bohemian life  --  that is to say , the gypsy life of the genius in the garret , where marriage , career , regular hours of work are all easily spotted as nothing but sly traps set by the bourgeoisie to kill the true spirit of man . These were the days when Gerard de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Les Halles and drew a pet lobsterafter him on a string , declaring that a lobster was far superior to a dog as a pet , evoking the poetry and mystery of the sea , and never barking . This was the day when Petrus Borel raged through Paris , roaring his defiance of a civilization that was replacing cathedrals with factoriesand bringing the Paris police armed with skirts and trousers swarming to his house on the top of Rochechouart hill to stop a congregation of nudists . It was for Petrus Borel that Dumas devised lycanthropy ice cream made with red raspberries and to be eaten from the cranium of a human skull , that skull that every good romantic writer kept on his desk to remind him of Shakespeare 's scene with Hamlet and the skull of poor Yorick . Who had time then for wife and child ? All night long Dumas would study his Moliere , his Goethe , his Corneille , his Calderon , determined to discover the secret by which the great writers cause the bones of their plots to become clothed with living flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a surgeon lays a body on a marble slab . And I would dissect out each character , and dig out each scene , and slice into every line , and put each word under a microscope . I was like Harvey looking for evidences of the circulationof the blood . I was like Mascagni tracing the microscopic course of the body 's lymphatics . I was Haller following up from the embryo the development of the human testicle . Yes , I was like an alchemist , spending each night in my laboratory , trying to find the secret of dramatic life , determined that someday I too would create my own homunculus in a bottle . " Often he would work until the wick of his lamp smoked and charred , because he did not have the money to buy more oil . Then he would extinguish the lamp to save the expensive wick and would recite by heart the plays he had studied , pacing up and down his room until dawn brought him enough light to resume his work . These were the days when Dumas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , thinking , praying nothing else but " God , show me a plot ! God , show me a magnificent plot ! Please , God ; and then like Archimedes who only wanted a fulcrum in order to move the globe with his finger , I shall take the theater of Paris by storm ! " It was in this state of mind that Dumas one day visited the Paris Salon and stopped short before a bas-relief done by a Mademoiselle de Faveau . It presented a startling scene : a man in the grip of two ruffians bent on assassinating him . They are awaiting final orders from a queenly woman at whose feet kneels a monk obviously pleading for the life of the victim . The power of the artist forces one to look to the queen and on her face one reads : No mercy ! What a scene for the theater ! Dumas the label on the bas-relief . Dumas ran out of the salon , his mind on fire . Here was his plot ! Here were his characters , here was his climactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the day of the week when he would do his best to drop in on Catherine , but he never even gave the matter a thought . He ran instead to Soulie , rich owner of a nearby sawmill , who lived atP225his place of business and had a fine reference library . This Soulie was himself a devoted romanticist , a dramatist and a novelist not without talent . Pretending to have nothing special on his mind except a friendly visit , and talking of this and that , Dumas took down a volume of Michaud 's Biographic Universelle from the shelves . It was , of course , the right one of the M volumes for the name Monaldeschi . He riffled the pages as if one page meant no more to him than another , but managed neverthless to stop on the page where Monaldeschi'sname was to be found . " Monaldeschi : see under Christina , Queen of Sweden , " he read . " Peste ! " he swore to himself . Now he had to go through the same maneuver with a C volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A long article . But a glance or two sufficed to show him the dramatic possibilities of this willful and dissolute monarch , imperious , learned , coarse , who received her lovers naked on sheets of black velvet , the better to show off her fair skin . And who , abdicating her throne , traveled around Europe with her lover Monaldeschi , whom she later judged and condemned to death in a highhanded usurpation of the functionsof the courts that aroused all Europe . Dumas ' brain whirled with the fire of creation : what an epic cross-purpose it was when Monaldeschi made love to the queen , concealing his true ambition , which was to get hold of the throne of Sweden , and the queen , thinking his love was for herself alone , decided to abdicate from that throne so that affairs of state would not come between her and the man she loved ! " What the devil are you looking up ? " Soulie asked . " Oh , just looking , " Dumas said . " I 'll bet I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " " First the M volume . That was for Monaldeschi . Then the C volume . That was for Christina ? Right ? " " How did you guess ? " " Guess ? There was n't any guessing . Everybody has been to the Salon , and every would-be dramatist in Paris has seen that hasrelief . Watch out : six months from now it will rain dramas about Christina . "   " You too ? " Dumas asked . " Why not ? " " You too want to be ready with a drama for the Theatre Francais when Hugo breaks open the doors ? " " Who says it must be Hugo that is first through the breach ? " Soulie asked . The thought startled Dumas . " Maybe it will be me , " said Soulie . " Or me ! " Dumas shouted . " Of course . It 's a race , " said Soulie . Dumas rose to leave . " Do n't go , " said Soulie . " We 'll have dinner together . " " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm starting . " Soulie laughed and tried to detain him , but Dumas left . When Soulie had said that in six months it would be raining dramas about Christina , Dumas had been ready to give the subject up , but now he realized that six months was precisely his advantage . He would write his in six weeks . Already the subject was boiling within him . Already he could see his plot unfolding trap after trap , with every scene a surprise package , precisely like those that brought such cries of joy from his son . Night after night he worked . Sundays made no interruption in his life . And five weeks later there lay on his table the play , copied out neatly . A romantic drama , but with two concessions to the Theatre Francais : it was in verse , and the characters were drawn from the aristocracy . But in every other aspect  --  in the violence of the plot , in the shifting of scenes , in the aging of the characters  --  it was a romantic play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play to the Theatre Francais . The only person he knew there was an old prompter from whom he would sometimes get cheap tickets , a man with nostrils so huge after years of snuff taking that he could put a whole boxful in either nostril and with one sneeze extinguish every lamp in the house . " I have a play , " said Dumas . " How do I get it read by the theater ? " " Why , there 's a playreading committee , " said the prompter. " tist leave your play at the box office addressed to them . "   " I see . And how long do they take to decide ? " " Oh , that depends . I do n't think they are very far behind in their reading right now , so you should hear in about a year or two . " " A year or two ! " Dumas screamed . " Bah , an unknown playwright . Do you imagine they are going to rush yours ahead of better-known writers ? Now , if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else again . " " If I were a friend of Baron Taylor 's , what then ? " " Why you 'd take it directly to him . He 's the head of the theater administration . " " I 'll make myself his friend ! " Dumas declared . He suddenly recalled that he had seen Baron Taylor 's name linked with that of Charles Nodier as authors of a series of books on Picturesque Voyages in France , and Nodier was the man whom he had met on his first night in Paris , the man who had hissed the play he himself had written . At once he ran to the Arsenal Library , where Nodier was librarian . " Tell him I ca n't see him this month , " said Nodier to his daughter Marie . She brought the message back to Dumas . Dumas went away but he did n't wait a month . He did n't even wait a day . Three times in the same day he came back , and finally Nodier saw him . " I want a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dumas said . " I ca n't interfere with Baron Taylor 's business , " said Nodier . " Remember the list of books you told me to read ? " Dumas asked . " I 've read them . Remember when you told me , Fill the pitcher and then pour ? I 'm pouring now . You ca n't stop me . Nobody can . " Dumas got his introduction to Baron Taylor and a day later had his appointment for seven o'clock in the morning , rue de Bondy , Number 42 , fourth floor . Dumas stayed up all night polishing his script . And at seven he entered an antechamber full of busts and books . Then a dining room full of paintings and books . Then a drawing room full of ancient weapons and books . And finally a bedroom full of manuscripts and books . And then a bathroom full of Baron Taylor in his bath and a gentleman who was reading a play to him from a manuscript . P228What a dull play it was , and how long-winded ! But obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally it was over , the bath water was icy , and Baron Taylor , shivering , escaped naked to the bedroom and to his bed , where he lay with his teeth chattering . Dumas ' heart was in his shoes . " All right , " said Taylor , with the expression of a martyr , " for this I am paid . So I am ready to listen to another play . " Trembling , Dumas drew from his pocket his manuscript . The bulk of it made Taylor groan . Dumas said , " Please , sir , let me read only one act . And if that act has bored you , then I will read no more . " " Young man , " said Taylor , " you are the first author ever to show me even that much charity . Go on . " Dumas was so flustered that he could scarcely read . But when the act was finished and he stopped and said , " Shall I continue ? " Baron Taylor said , " Of course . At last a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Dumas had finished , Taylor leaped from his bed and shouted for his servant . " Pierre ! My clothes ! Young man , be prepared to read this to the full committee . I am going to call a special meeting for Thursday . It 's time we had plays that were more than wind ! " Thursday was the opening day of Dumas ' career . For the first time , in the green room of the Theatre Francais , he really met some of the great people of his era . All the best-known actresses and actors of the Paris stage were present , the ladies all in the latest gay , flowery hats , and the men in tight trousers and in frock coats that flared like little skirts . And when the reading was interrupted repeatedly with applause and with requests that he read again the monologue of Sentinelli or the scene between Sentinelli and Monaldeschi , then it seemed to Dumas that his heart must fly out of his ribs . And when it was over and the play was accepted , with minor details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran home , so drunk with his success that he looked everybody saucily in the face , thinking , You , you , you  --  you have n't had a play accepted . And without minding traffic he pushed his way across streets , shoving horsesP229aside and holding up cabs and being shouted at and stumbling in wet gutters , and finally he was home and he bounded into his mother 's room crying , " By acclamation ! Accepted by acclamation ! " How proudly he went to his office the next morning ! It would n't be long , he thought , before all this letter copying was behind him . An office boy brought him word that Monsieur de Broval , the chief , wanted to see him at once . " Young man ! " said Monsieur de Broval , glaring at Dumas , " who gave you permission to use the name of the Duke of Orleans in order to get your play accepted by the national theater of France ? " Dumas was nonplused . " But I did no such thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning papers . " The Committeeof the Theatre Francais announces that it has accepted for productiona tragedy written by an employee of the Duke of Orleans . " " That must be me , " Dumas admitted . " But I assure you I never said anything about the Duke of Orleans . " " And they accepted your play anyhow ? " " Yes . By acclamation . " Monsieur de Broval snorted . " You expect me to believe that the committee accepted your play when they have recently refused the work of such well-known and important playwrights as Viennet , Lemercier and Lebrun ? Now deny , if you dare , that you pushed yourself in by making some crazy claim about the support of the Duke of Orleans . Deny it ! " " I must deny it , " said Dumas . " Because I did n't . I was accepted because they liked my play . They loved it . " " You would do better to confess your error , my friend , " Monsieur de Broval concluded . " For the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , then it will be clear to everyone that the committeehas found you out . And when they do n't produce it , we will know how to deal with the schemer whose scheme did not work . I shall be sorry when that happens , sorry for your poor mother who has nothing to live on except the money you make here . But I shall not be sorry for you who have made such an arrogant and impermissibleuse of the Duke 's name . " Dumas quaked for a second at the thought of being without a job , but of course there was really nothing to worry about . The play had been accepted . Everyone had been wild about it . Actors andP230actresses , even before he had finished the reading , had started to quarrel over the distribution of parts . Nodier , hearing of Baron Taylor 's enthusiasm for Dumas ' work , invited the young man to his Sunday-evening dinners . And now the world of Dumas opened wider . He met such people as Lamartineand Alfred de Vigny , two of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter Boulanger and the sculptor Barye . It was only the first of many such evenings that Dumas was to spend in the delightful Louis XV interior that the government provided for the librarian and his family , with Madame Nodier presiding at a fine dinner , with Nodier himself talking as a librarian should  --  that is to say , like an encyclopedist  --  with Marie Nodier afterward playing the piano , and then the rugs pushed aside , candles placed on the parquet floor so that the guests could dance between the flames and admire their fantastic shadows on the wall . Only one thing disturbed Dumas and that was the presence of Victor Hugo , whose right to the opening shot in the romantic captureof the Theatre Francais Dumas could not help but feel that he was usurping . But Victor Hugo could not have been more charming . " I would have hastened to congratulate you at once , " he said , " except that I know only too well how many hurdles there are ahead of you . Acceptanceby the committee means very little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already quarreling about the roles they want . " " No doubt . But there are plays accepted by the Theatre Francais fifty and a hundred years ago that have still not seen the light of day . " " But Baron Taylor insists on immediate production . " " Of course . But what about Picard ? " " Picard ? Who is Picard ? " " Have n't you ever heard of Picard ? " " I know a Picard who thirty , forty years ago wrote many plays that no one bothers to read now . " " He 's not dead yet . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean that he no longer writes plays , but he still lives , a gimleteyedhunchback , who , committee or no committee , Baron Taylor orP231no Baron Taylor , still runs the Theatre Frangais by virtue of the fact that he passes on the literary value of all plays . He nests in the Theatre Francais like some ancient spider and has the whole of it in his web . I 'm surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Perhaps he has , " Dumas exclaimed . " I received word this afternoon to bring a copy of my play to the theater tomorrow . " " Ah , you see . And woe unto you if Picard should find one limping verse , one rhyme that is n't rich , one misplaced caesura . He will make it his excuse for rejecting the whole play . " " But the committee . . . " " He will fight the committee , he will go to the Academy and call upon them to stop this play for the sake of the preservation of the French language . He will run to the conservative newspapers and they will write editorials about the state 's giving its money to a theater that is ruining France . And the management of the theater will take alarm at a possible cut in their budget , and the ministry will be worried and the whole government will be involved . Oh , you have no inkling yet of all that there is before you . " Dumas sighed . All his cathedral dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heat of the sun . Hugo said , " Would you be offended if I made a suggestion ? Let me go over your script ? " " I would not be offended , " Dumas cried . " I 'd be delighted . But it must be done tonight . Tomorrow I must bring a copy to the theater . " Both Hugo and Alfred de Vigny spent the night with Dumas correctingthe worst flaws of his poetry . " You 're not precisely the best poet in the world , " Hugo observed . " No , " Dumas admitted . " It needs more than a few hours to make good poetry out of poor poetry . " " I suppose so , " said Dumas humbly . " But there 's no doubt you can write theater , " Hugo added , with what sounded like a touch of envy . " That 's all I want to write , " said Dumas . But a few days later Picard called Dumas into his office . " Are you rich ? " he asked Dumas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm poor . " " Then whatever brought you into the hazardous profession of literature ? " " Why . . . my faith in my talent , I suppose . " " Talent ? That 's not enough . " " I have ambition . I apply myself without rest . " " Good . But still not enough to live on . " " I have a position that brings me in fifteen hundred francs a year . " " Well , hold on to it , young man . " " Yes , sir . I intend to do that , if I can . But why this advice ? " " Because here 's your play . Remember this , young man : disorder is not liberty . Did you hear me ? " " Yes , sir . " " What did I say ? " " You said disorder is not liberty . " " Yes . And confusion is not genius . Are you listening ? " " Yes . Confusion is not genius . " " And instinct is not reason . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French language is no proof of poetic ability . And the Theatre Francais has a higher purpose than merely to whip up the emotions of an audience . Good-by , sir . " Dumas , drenched with this catechism as if someone had capped him with a chamberpot , ran to Baron Taylor . " I know , I know , " said Taylor . " But we 're all against Picard in this matter . And we 're fighting back . " But a few days later a new force had entered the battle  --  the editor of the Constitutionnel , an extremely conservative paper . " He too has something against my play ? " Dumas asked Taylor . " Nothing at all . But he does have a mistress . And this mistress has a friend , a classical writer by the name of Brault , whose doctor ... " " Whose doctor ? How does a doctor come into this ? " " Listen and you 'll see . This doctor is called upon to treat Brault , who is at death 's door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unexpected joy . " " Ahl " said Dumas . " I understand . And Brault has written a play and the unexpected joy would be a production . " Precisely . In fact Brault has written a Christine too . And
