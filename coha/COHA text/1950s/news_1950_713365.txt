txt Continuing his attack on Representative Walter A. Lynch , his Democratic-Liberal opponent , Governor Dewey charged last night that Mr. Lynch , as a ? member of the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives , favored a proposal to " free the underworld " from criminal income tax prosecution . Governor Dewey , Republican candidate for re-election , spoke at the closing Brooklyn Republican rally at the Academy of Music , with Controller Frank Moore , candidate for Lieutenant Governor ; Attorney General Nathaniel L. Goldstein , candidate for re-election , and others . John R. Crews , Kings County chairman , presided . For a Republican meeting in Brooklyn , the audience was enthusiastic , greeting Governor Dewey and the other candidates with prolonged applause . The hall was well filled , about 2,600 persons being present . Cites Crime of Tax Dodging " Under the law , it is a crime not to pay your share of the income tax , " the Governor said . " That 's a good law and all decent people respect it . It was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was under that law that I prosecuted and convicted the notorious gangster , Waxey Gordon . " It was under that law that I sent many Tammany Hall leaders and gangsters to prison . It has been in many cases the only way in which the law was able to reach criminals who had committed crimes but were unable to report and pay taxes on the profit of their crimes . " Al Capone and every other gangster indicted for failure to pay income tax offered to pay any sum the Government would choose to assess in order to buy their freedom . But it is up to the Treasury Department to say whether such men will be allowed to make a payment and escape prosecution for failure to report their income and pay taxes on it . " Governor Dewey said the proposal backed by " the Flynn-Tammany candidate for Governor " would have made it possible for Al Capone , Waxey Gordon or even " Frank Costello , the present king ' of the underworld and boss of Tammany Hall , " to own up to back taxes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional Quarterly for the week ending May 26 , this year on page 621 reports that the Ways and Means Committee on May 25  --  and I quote ? voted a vir tual amnesty to income tax defaulters who make a full and complete disclosure of the amount of their tax underpayments and agree to pay up . Under the provision agreed upon , such voluntary confessions would subject a tax dodger to civil penalties ( 50 per cent of the total tax plus 6 per cent of the unpaid portion ) but would amount to a guarantee against criminal prosecution ' " Now what does that mean ? It means an open promise to the underworld and the profiteers , saying : . ' Came on in boys and tell us your troubles . We 'll let you pay a little extra and never worry about prison bars . ' " Governor Dewey added that Mr. Lynch , " in alibiing his support of this proposal , was quoted by THE NEW YORK TIMES of May 25 as having said : " Nobody knows if he goes in good faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from criminal prosecution . " Governor Dewey asserted that the proposal aroused a wave of protest in Congress and quoted two Democratic Representatives , Herbert Eberharter of Pennsylvania and Stephen Young of Ohio , as objecting to it . The Congressional Quarterly for the week ended June 23 reported that on June 16 the Ways and Means Committee " erased from the bill a previous decision to give tax dodgers a last chance to settle up ' with the Government before institution of criminal proceedings . " " I am glad to report that the proposal was killed by the solid vote of all the Republicans and a few good Democrats , " the Governor commented . " This whole rotten episode gives new meaning to the revelation made last week by the present Acting Mayor of New York City that Frank Costello , king of the underworld , is in fact the boss of Tammany Hall . " It gives new meaning to the fact that the Flynn-Tammany bosses , now running the government of New York . City , handpicked the Democratic candidates for state office and foisted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gives new meamn o the charge that , if the Flynn any ticket wins this electio Frank Costello will be Governor of New York .

Dewey read a letter from Dr. Cornelius Rhoads , director of the Sloane Kettering Institute of Cancer Research at Memorial Hospital , whom he described as the leading cancer authority in America , in which Dr. Rhoads wrote : " The present administration in New York State has brought about marked improvement in the facilities for the diagnosis , treatment and study of cancer among its citizens .

He also said the State Department of Health Laboratory , under its director , Dr. Dalldors , had instituted for the first time an important program of cancer research . Governor Dewey said Mr. Lynch was in error when he talked about $42,000 in Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , the state was receiving a $299,000 Federal grant for cancer control . Attorney General Goldstein charged Mr. Lynch with misstatements in accusing Governor Dewey of laxity in enforcement of the antidiscrimination in employment law , in enforcement of the laws against gambling and in not providing adequate rent control . " I am the law officer of the state , and any charge of laxity should be made against me , " Mr. Goldstein said . " I am proud of my record in enforcing the law against discrimination . I have aided district attorneys in law enforcement , and District Attorney Miles F. in my home county came to me for aid in his investigation of gambling . New York State had rent control and protected tenants when the . Federal and city authorities failed . " . Declaring the he was the man responsible for the state 's capital construction fund , Controller Meore said : " Every dime of it that has not been spent for hospitals and highways and our vast program of post-war improvements is there .
