How much has the U.S. output in real goods grown since 1929 ? Last week the Department of Commerce announced the gain : 75% . It was less than half the increase shown by dollar figures , largely because of the drop in the dollar 's purchasing power . <P> To make its computation , the department picked 1939 as a reasonable norm between prosperity and depression , and used that year 's purchasing power of the dollar as a base . With this measuring stick , said the department , the gross national product for 1929 was $85.9 billion , instead of the actual dollar figure of $103.8 billion . The gross national product for 1950 was $153 billion , instead of the actual dollar figure of $280 billion . Said Commerce : the use of current dollars to measure the national product conceals a price rise of about 50% since 1929 . But , even on an adjusted basis , reported Commerce , the output of real goods in 1950 increased 7% over 1949- " a more than average gain . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
