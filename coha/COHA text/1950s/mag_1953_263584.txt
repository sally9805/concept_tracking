The British last week made their first move to reopen Iranian oil negotiations , broken off last March by Mohammed Mossadegh . To the U.S. , Britain sent a note outlining terms on which it was willing to resume talks . This set off a flurry of speculation in the world 's oil industry , already facing prospects of a surplus . What would happen to world oil prices if Iran 's annual production of some 240 million barrels , 6% of the free world 's present supply , suddenly came on the market ? <P> Despite some oilmen 's fears , there did not seem to be much cause for worry . On a purely political basis , a settlement still looked a long way off . Although the Shah 's new government would like nothing better than to start cashing in on its oil again , it would be folly for any politician in rabidly nationalist Iran to seem eager to deal with the British . And even after talks start , there are bound to be long months of haggling over Britain 's three preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fair compensation " for its expropriated properties ; 2 ) that the British balance of payments not be affected unfavorably ( i.e. , that Iran will not compete with Britain in supplying oil to dollar markets ) ; 3 ) that Iran get no better deal than other oil-producing countries in the Middle East , an especially touchy demand since Saudi Arabia , Iraq and Kuwait are reportedly seeking higher royalties from British and U.S. companies . <P> Even after a settlement , most oilmen estimate that it will take months to get the Abadan refineries back in full operation , especially since there is no pressing demand for the oil . Since Mossadegh nationalized the industry , there has been a startling change in the world oil situation . To replace the Iranian oil , the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co . ( TIME , March 9 ) and other oil companies have rapidly expanded production ( see chart ) and refining . In the Middle East alone , crude-oil output in Kuwait , Iraq , Saudi Arabia and Qatar reached 768 million barrels in 1952 , 354 million more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the U.S. and Venezuela , crude-oil production was also stepped up . New refining capacity has more than made up for Abadan 's loss . In the face of this sharply increased output , world demand has shown signs lately of leveling off . Last year demand went up only 5% , compared to increases of about 12% in previous years . In the U.S. , stocks of oil above ground have increased sharply , and there are signs that the free world 's thirst for oil has been momentarily satisfied . <P> Nevertheless , in case of a settlement , the major oil companies , for political reasons , would have to find a way to absorb Iran 's oil , just as they found a way to make up its loss . Over a short period this might mean some cuts in present world oil production and a change in the patterns of oil marketing . But in the long run , the world would probably have no trouble using Iran 's oil , since oil companies estimate that world demand for oil will continue to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
