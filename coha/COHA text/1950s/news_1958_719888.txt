txt Soviet industrial production continues to rise with impressive continuity . This is the burden of the plan-fulfillment report for the first half of this year which Pravda has just published . , The over-all rate of growth is the same as that reported a year ago . But . there have been changes . These are , in the main , improvements , with a few new departures , along with some special urgencies and bottlenecks . Thus , while metallurgy , industrial chemistry , and the production of building materials accelerated their rate of growth , the food industry progressed more slowly than last year . Indeed , a major effort to boost chemical industry and metallurgy shines through the pages of the report . Tin , formerly in short supply , headed the list of materials for which the plan was fulfilled ahead of time ; it was followed by zinc and copper , of which the Soviets now seem to have more than they can process , since sizable quantities have been offered abroad . Aluminum , lead , and molybdenum also were produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilizer and other chemical products ( synthetic ammonia , caustic soda , synthetic rubber tires , and phosphoric acid ) were ahead of schedule . Oil production continued to rise at the spectacular rate of 17 per cent a year . The output of natural gas and chemical equipment progressed much more rapidly than last year . In line with efforts to step up automation , electronic tubes made a marked sprint . Electricity and mineral fertilizer accelerated their rate of . growth moderately . Production of oil equipment progressed at a slower rate than in the first half of 1957 , when the Central Statistical Administration reported an increase of 48 per cent . Although the rate of growth continued to be high ( 29 per cent ) , it looks as though part of this burden had been shifted to Romania . Among agricultural machines , new types of mowers were turned out at high speed . The idea seems to be to assure the supply of the collective farms with green fodder and to get the peasants to leave dairy farming to the collectives which have facilities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual collective-farm members  --  a theme which is being played up constantly in the press . Assets Strained On the other hand , production of quite a few other agricultural machines progressed at a slower rate than last year . This is believed to have something to do with the fact that the government no longer rents out agricultural machines to the collective farms through tts machine and tractor stations ( MTS ) . More than two-thirds of all collective farms have purchased their own machines from the MTS . This has taxed the financial assets of the farms and may explain why the government hesitated to step up production of agricultural equipment as fast as in the past . The program of modernization ? dieselization and electrification  --  of the railroads is in full swing , as is shown by the fact that the output of railway engines . has increased sharply . Twenty thousand large freight cars also were added to the rolling stock . Roofing material showed an exceptionally high rate of growth . This seems to be connected with the current campaign to speed up individual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up twice as fast as in 1956 and the total living space - provided by private homes was equal to the entire government plan for housing construction in that year . Cotton Lag Noted A faster rate of production for wool and linen fabrics and leather footwear represented a concession to consumer requirements . But the output of cotton fabrics ? far more important than wool and linen to the mass of the population  --  continued at a very slow rate as a result of the failure of the cotton harvest to reach the official targets . The agricultural sections of the plan fulfillment report are drafted in an optimistic tone , but there are gaps and incongruencies . Last year 's report listed specifically production increases for meat , milk , eggs , wool , etc . This year there was a sweeping statement that production increased , but only the increase of deliveries to the state was listed specifically . Experience shows that for certain items deliveries can increase , if the government takes or buys a larger share of a production which has remained stationary , declined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of growth definitely has declined . The number of hogs on collective and state ? farms last year increased by 21 per cent and this year by only 11 per cent . On the other hand 30 per cent more hogs were fattened . Although the report states that the private livestock herd of the collective-farm peasants , workers , and employees also has increased , it seems that the relatively large Increase of the communal herds was achieved largely at the expense of privately owned cattle . Another important fact is the disclosure that the number of workers increased by only 1,000,000 as compared with an increase of 2,100,000 in July , 1957 . While the much slower rise in the . labor force may be partly explained by the fact that some of the workers and employees of liquidated machine and tractor stations have been made members of the collective farms , who do not count as workers , It is more likely ' that the effects of the war years on the population Increase are beginning to show .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
