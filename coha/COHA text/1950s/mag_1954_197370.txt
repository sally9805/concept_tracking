Which way is U.S. art heading ? There have been some signs that it is going away from abstraction . But that is not the trend shown by what museums buy . Last week the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center had on view its fifth biennial show of new acquisitions by U.S. museums . Among the 59 pictures by contemporary U.S. painters , 14 works were realistic . Thirteen were completely nonobjective . Of the rest , a majority could be described as semi-decipherable , mainly because the artists gave a hint of their meanings by the titles . Said Director James Byrnes of the Fine Arts Center : " Nonobjective painting is not confined to any one place . It has permeated to the grass roots . Regionalism is essentially dead , and representational painting has almost been submerged . U.S. nonobjective artists are in the forefront of world painting . "
