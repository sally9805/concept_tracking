In his Washington political column syndicated to 145 U.S. dailies , last week Columnist Marquis Childs , 50 , struck a gloomy note . " Neither party , " wrote Fair Dealer Childs , " has come to any overall policy agreement within its own ranks . . . If we are to save ourselves , we must . . . think anew and act anew . " The sentiment was not new , but for Childs it had a special meaning . This week he quit as a political pundit for United Features , went back to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , where he had been a staffer for 18 years before leaving to start his column in 1944 . United Features will continue to syndicate his P-D stories three days a week , but Childs will be paid by the PD , not the syndicate . Childs had a candid explanation for his return to the PD . Says he : " There 's a terrible danger of becoming a stuck whistle as a columnist . " <P> Mark Childs was not alone in the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of solving the world 's problems four , five and six days a week takes a heavy toll . " The journalistic profession , " said one Washington newsman , commenting on Childs 's shift , " has made the job of the columnists impossible . He has to turn out something with meaning five days a week . He ca n't digest events . He 's a victim of inconsistency . He can really become a kind of high-class gossip monger if he 's not careful . " <P> <P> For the PD , Childs will work out of Washington , concentrating on interpretive reporting of foreign affairs ( he left this week for the Berlin conference and a tour of Europe ) . While Childs decided to go back to his old paper at " a slight financial loss , " he thinks this will be more than made up by the freedom of his new job . Says Childs : " I feel I will have more latitude as a reporter . I think the column 's been doing very well , but there was the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid that by going back to reporting as the basis of my writing . "
