 | I 'm married to a working mother @# MY W I F E , by her own choice and desire , and indeed , with my approval and abetment , is a working mother . Because of this , novelists , psychiatrists , dramatists , criminologists , as well as the man ( and woman ) on the street have recently joined together in attacking her with such vehemence you would think she was an admixture of jezebel , Medea , and leading lady at the Salem Witchcraft Festival .. My wife 's antagonists accuse her with monotonous regularity of a familiar compound of felonies against man ( me ) , nature ( our two preschool children ) , and the very structure of our civilization ( male superiority complex ) . It is not enough , however , for my wife 's detractors to censure her . They go even further : they pity me . As the husband of a working wife I am , they say , nothing more than a third of a man ? illhoused , ill-clothed , and ill-fed . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be constantly meted our C ( for Career ) rations . I walk around with holes in my Argyles . My home not only is not my castle , as is my droit de gender , but it is physically unkempt , unadorned with the pleasing frills of distaff decor , and is the breeding ground for progressive juvenile delinquencv . And , more 's the pity ( for me ) , my borne is spiritually lacking in the comfort of a dedicated shoulder and the soothing of a compassionate palm when it is most needed : i.e. , after a hard day at the office . In addition to these pity-pats at my external existence , the opponents of economic feminism bombard me with assorted jabs aimed to sway me inside where I really live ? my maleness . " Why is your wife working ? Are n't you man enough to support your family yourself ? " is one such direct and rhetorical appeal to my better masculine nature . Or they taunt me with red-blooded statistics to show how it is possible for my wife to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes ! Not content with trying to reach the male me through my muscles , the career-mother prohibitionists also try to appeal to my most distinctive and therefore most vulnerable masculine bent : logic . " If you let your wife do your job , " they sweet-reason me , " ergo , you 'll have to do hers . " The innuendo here is plain . Ani I man or house-keeper ? Thus , as a working mother 's husband , I am depicted as merely a Strindberg father ? a functionary in the process of propagation . Beyond this , I am useful only as a joint in the bank account and income-tax return . The one act , the sex segregationists assure me , in which I perform my properly designated role as principal is in taking out an insurance policy on my life . In short , I am a man who is neglected , subordinated , emaciated , emasculated , and worth more dead than alive . Who ? Me ? I submit that this pitiable characterization  | bears no resemblance to any living husband I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I think it 's ut time for the man behind the woman who works to stand up and be counted . For my part , affirm categorically : I never had it so good . And I present herewith my testimony . WHAT 'S IN IT FOR ME LE T ' S start with all the comforts of home our home . Because my wife , by and the necessity of her schedule , practices planned housekeepinghood , I come home from office every night to an orderly , well-run house . We are equipped ( with the aid of my ife 's salary ) both with modern miracles ? washing machine and dryer , dishwasher , freezer , sewing machine , and vacuum cleaner ? and with that old-fashioned wonder combination ? housekeepernursemaid . Consequently , my Argyles are darned , shirts ironed , suits sent out to clean , shoes to repair , and garbage to can ? on schedule . I am not pounced on as soon as I come through the front door at night with demands to take care of handy jobs around the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the roof is on the verge of falling through , to pick up the phone and call Mr. B. , the roofer , to hurry on over tomorrow first thing to fix it . I am allergic to dust and wood shavings , but , more fundamentally , I am completely incompatible with hammer , saw , or drill . One of the first articles in the bill of rights my wife and I appended to our marriage pact covered the fact that since we were going to budget part of the salary check marked Hers to pay for a housekeeper-nursemaid , we would also set aside a portion of His to take care of my life membership dues in the Let-George-Do-It-Himself Society . I have never once , in my married life , prepared my own breakfast . My wife has to get up and out at the same time I do , so she looks her best sooner in the morning . In the dawn 's surly light I am exposed to a minimum of the curler , cold-cream , cottonhousecoat routine . Sure , I love the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her luck too long and too early . I see more of my wife because she is working . We ride the commuter trains both Ways together . We often have lunch together . Thus , we have more time with each other away from the children : a hiatus that most , if not all , well-meaning and even doting parents will grant has inherent pleasurable advantages . Because we have frequent opportunities to talk to each other without hindrance of progeny ? that is , without interruption ? we can cut down on the amount of home " grown-up " talk in front of them . I hold it to be axiomatic that , iii the presence of children ( of all ages ) , parents should be seen but their problems not heard . Our phone bill is low since my wife is not home during the day . My wife is " in town anyway " ; therefore , during her lunch hours she can take care of buying gifts including those for my family , returning and exchanging purchases , and standing in line for theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktails with visitors from each of our firehouses . I am not compelled to drag myself out in the evenings to take her " somewhere-anywhere-I don't-care , " because she 's been cooped up in the house all week with nothing but screaming children to scream with . On the other hand , it 's easy , and even politic , for me to arrange an occasional poker or bowling night with the boys . This is because ? her days not permitting ? she has a need , even a yen , every so often to be alone and curl up with bobby pins , nail polish , and file . Also , I find I can often control our departure time at week-night parties , which I 'm not enjoying very much but she is , with a solicitous reminder : " Do n't forget , dear , you have to make the office early tomorrow , too . " But at week-night parties which I am enjoying very much but she 's not , I can maneuver our lingering with a similar reminder played , however , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have to make the office early tomorrow , too . " My social life is more stimulating and variegated because of the additional contacts my wife makes through her job . She paid for her own fur coat . Her working ? at a job she wants to do and is appreciated for ? relieves me of the worry of having to create projects for her and offer periodic reassurances that will make her confident she is making a worthy contribution to husband , home , family , and society . Her career is beneficial to my health . It reduces to a comfortable and safe low my pressures , blood and prestige . The bare fact that she makes a good salary is soothing to my nerves , even though most of her salary does go for expenses a non-working housewife need not have : the previously mentioned housekeeper-nursemaid , my wile 's increased wardrobe needs , our larger grocery bills ( because she can not shop around for bargains ) , and our higher-income-36 HARPER 'S  | bracket tax load . And since my wife is otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teas , and bridges , she is n't exposed to the feverish social disease of title-dropping , a chronic contagious ailment , often wife-carried , which infects susceptible husbands . Thus , I am able to maintain a high degree of immunity to this common virus known among men as vice-president-bucking fever . She does , however , give aid and comfort to my career . A few years ago I was faced with a choice between taking a chance on a new venture or staying secure . I took the chance even though it meant no income for ten months . I give the greater part of the credit to my wife for my having dared the bold and ? as events are proving ? giant step upward . It 's not that I admire my courage and foresight less , but that I value her encouragement and salary more . She helps me to be relaxed about my job both during and after hours . I can and certainly do talk with her about office politics and personalities , above and beyond gossip . This is made the easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and indeed the very nature of the beast of my daily burden . When I unload my work woes she does n't , however , merely offer a credulous ear , wide-eyed loyalty , or cluck-clucking sympathy ? all of which , of course , are good , proper , and dutiful . She does more . She is able to give , when necessary , practical and professional assistance . In sum , my wife understands me . Do I understand my wife ? Well , shucks . . . AND FOR ' HER BUT I will venture far enough out of my limbo to claim that my wife ? my wife ; not Tom 's , not even Dick 's , but perhaps Harry 's , too ? is a better wife , a better mother , and a better person for working . I submit that she has come to this higher degree of attainment because she ( and , let 's face it , I ) have managed to effect a fulfilling correlation between her needs and her equipment . She 's doing the kind of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in journalism ) to do . At the same time , by instinct ( feminine ) , example ( her mother , a non-careerist , was and is a whiz around the house ) , and experience ( she had an apartment with two other girls before we were married ) , she derives great satisfaction in acting as editor in chief of our home . In her domestic executive capacity she plans the meals , orders provisions , selects and buys all household furnishings , supervises arrangements for home entertainment , and fully organizes the daily household routine . To her **31;33;TOOLONG , who is well-trained , well-paid , devoted , and loving ( both as to property and person ) , she assigns the other various departments : dusting , mopping , sweeping . polishing , laundering , **27;66;TOOLONG , grocerystoring , cooking , and the eternal waiting for the repair man who finally shows up to fix the refrigerator after three unkept appointments . My wife has , and , of course , takes the prerogative ? woman 's and editor in chief 's ? of applying final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , she 's not Craig 's Wife about it , but it 's her house . My wife loves to cook and bake ? as a weekend hobby . Her job is preparing her for the probability of widowhood which the actuaries promise for her later years . What does a wife-mother do after she 's raised her children and lowered her husband ? Money aside ( but these days who can put any there ? ) my wife 's career is the best of all insurance policies for her future . It will give her inestimable emotional and spiritual benefits . It 's my belief ? and consequent comfort ? that because my wife will have her job to keep her occupied and " belonging " after I am gone , she will have less opportunity to feed on her own aloneness and less need to poach on her children 's sympathy and spare room . Her job has not interfered with her creative functioning as a child-bearer . On the contrary , our two salaries have provided economic sanction for having children sooner and oftener . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her children . There is no question in her mind , in mine , or in her employers ' that in any case ? from measles to growing pains ? the children come first . When each of our two sons was born she took six months ' maternity leave ( which was granted without loss of seniority or pension benefits by her company 's forward-looking policy of enlightened selfinterest ) . For our next child ( currently expected ) , she will take similar leave . When her office day is clone and my wife comes home to the boys , it is a meeting at the summit . My wife 's eagerness , the children 's energy , and the housekeeper-nursemaid 's relief are all at their most . For this is six o'clock jump time , sometimes called Children 's Hour . My wife is refreshed by the joy of seeing the boys and she is keyed to give them unbegrudgingly her ingenuity and patience , while the housekeeper-nurse- maid retires peacefully to the kitchen and last-minute dinner preparations . It is my observa- tion that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the laundry , the home-fried potatoes , that recalcitrant refrigerator repair man , and the program chairwoman of the PTA , prior to these energy-peaked hours around sun-set , is not physically , mentally , or divinely able as is a homecoming mother to channel the children 's vim , vigor , and , of course , video . @# TWO-PARENT FAMILY H EN , too , because my wife and I are Tin this thing together , it is easier for me to adjust to the nightly impact with the boys . I do n't come home with the harassed feeling that I 'm rushing in from the bullpen to save the game in the late innings . Rather than causing a separation of interest , my wife 's away-from-home schedule brings about a studied togetherness in our family . It is not that our boys have lost a mother , but that they have gained a father . I arrange to spend more time with the children and accordingly share in more child-tending functions than I believe I would if my wife were not working , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children , singularly and mutually rewarding . We all benefit from the fact that ours is a two-parent as well as two-income family . On an average weekday we are with our boys a minimum of four hours . This includes the family hour at breakfast and the three-hour dinner-bedtime period from six to nine . They have been fortified for this later-than-average bedtime by a purposely maintained longer-thanaverage afternoon nap . On weekends our sleep-in housekeeper-nursemaid goes off to a well-earned and necessary life of her own so that she can return fresh on Monday . Our time then with the children , other than when our social life requires an occasional baby-sitter , is a sons-up to sons-down cycle . Thus , the schedules of the parties of all parts ? parents , children , and housekeeper-nursemaidare established on the principle , for the advantage of all but at the expense of none , and dedicated to the proposition that our time with the children be concerted , concentrated , and contented . And , by adhering to this principle and proposition , the sum of all parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are happy in my wife 's work . Yet , there is danger that we may be deprived of our happiness . My wife has been reading those magazine articles , books , and novels ? many of which are written or edited by working mothers , of course ? in which she is stereotyped as " the girl in the gray flannel suit ? grasping , ambitious , domineering , masculine , and getting an ulcer . " ( In not one particular does she fit this run-down . ) She also sees those movies and television shows where career girls are always either the wise-cracking Eve Arden Type who never gets the man , or the competent , attractive , but ( in a ( lose-up ) secretly rueful Rosalind Russell Type who leaps at the opportunity to throw over her S50,000-a-year job and become Mrs. Cary Grant in order to have What Every Girl Really Wants . ( A career-chastity vow must necessarily precede even marriage , let alone motherhood , for Hollywood 's and television 's heroines . ) My wife is not impervious to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I fear , begin to believe the hearsay evidence of the witnesses for her persecution . She may even come to believe she is all the things the propagandists say she is and none of the things we who are her collaborators know she is . There is , in fact , a clear and present danger that she will wake up one morning with a prefabricated guilt feeling . Then she will quit her job . If that happens it will seriously abridge our family 's life , liberty , and pursuit of happiness , as herein detailed . If that happens the real guilt ? for unconstitutionally suppressing my wife 's freedom to work , marry , and have children ? falls upon her arbitrary critics-at-large . And so , it is to these critics I address this impassioned charge : When are you going to stop beating my wife ?
