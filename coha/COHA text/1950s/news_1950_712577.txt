txt PARIS , Jan. ** three successive votes tonight , the French National Assembly gpve its confidence to Premier Georges Bidault , but the voting left the Government seriously weakened . The majority on the first question , which concerned the voting of new taxes , was reduced to four votes , the smallest margin obtained in six votes of confidence that the Premier has had to ask to obtain passage of the budget on the first reading . The count on this was 300 to 296 . In the succeeding votes on the question of balancing the accounts and , on the budget bill as a whole , the Government obtained margins of thirteen and twenty-two votes , in counts of 304 to 291 , and 305 to 283 . At the end of these ballotings , the budget had been voted in the Assembly on its first reading , but under such conditions that made its adoption within the next two months doubtful and left the Assembly echoing with dangerous discords . The bill , as passed , is almost balanced , with expenditures estimated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down at 2,119,000,000,000 . This assumes that savings amounting to 20,000 , - 000,000 francs will be made during the year on departmental outlays . The bill includes on the receipt side of the ledger items for Marshall Plan aid and loans , partly from the United States , totaling 50,000,000,000 francs for war reconstruction and 380,000,000,000 for equipment and modernization facilities . The difference in the balance is to be covered by resource 's voted by the amendments adopted today , which include increases in the petroleum taxes , taxes on motor transports and some other smaller items . The Cabinet will meet tomorrow to decide the fate of a bill for the // BIDAULT 'S HOLD CUT ON THREE BALLOTS // return to collective bargaining . That bill threatens more serious conflicts for the Cabinet : With the majority so tightly drawn , it is thought unlikely that the bill can be passed by the opening of the regular session next Tuesday .

M. Bidault was believed to have saved the Cabinet from defeat when , at the last minute in the debate , he told the Assembly that he would accept amendments and new suggestions when the ways and means measures came up . Close supporters of the Government had predicted defeat prior to that concession by the Premier . The clash with the Socialists is expected to open after a meeting of its special committee , recently created to determine party policy in Government emergencies . Failure to vote the bill on a return to collective bargaining will revive the threat of the Socialists to withdraw from the Cabinet unless the cost-of-living bonus is renewed for the workers . It is not thought likely that the bill can be passed by the Assembly and come back from the Council of the Republic during the week . Finance Minister Maurice Petsche is determined t ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the Marshall Plan agreement , and is opposed to a renewal of the bonus . In parliamentary circles tonight , the outlook was regarded as still quite precarious for the budget . It is expected to go to the advisory second House when the organization of the new Parliament has been completed , about Jan. 18 . The debate in the Council of the Republic may last up to twenty-five days . The budget may be rejected or returned with amendments , which would require the Assembly to obtain an absolute majority of 311 votes to pass the budget bill on a second reading ; Thus far , no confidence vote has given the Government more than 306 votes .
