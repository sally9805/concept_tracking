RECOLLECTIONS OF LOGAN PEARSALL SMITH ( 259 pp. ) - Roberf Gafhorne-Hardy-Macmillan ( $3.50 ) . <P> Logan Pearsall Smith was one of the last of an almost vanished type : the gifted dilettante who lives on inherited income and putters about the suburbs of literature . As the child of zealous Philadelphia Quakers ( his father was a glass manufacturer ) , little Logan fell in love with religion at the age of four and for the next few years became , as he later put it , an " odious little prig " who would clamber aboard horse cars handing out tracts and asking people if they had been saved . Before long he lost his faith ; never again would he so thoroughly commit his emotions to an interest outside himself . <P> In 1888 , at 23 , Smith left the U.S. to settle in England with a lump inheritance and a passion for foraging fine phrases from great writers who had created more than mere phrases . He would occasionally turn out such little books as Trivia and More Trivia , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distill the essence of his new-found cultivation into concise paragraphs . Smith 's lapidary phrases were admired by such tweedy literary folk as Christopher Morley , but , reread today , they seem rather cold and feeble. * <P> No Flinching . In his 60s Smith was once rummaging through a bookstore when he met a clerk who shared his enthusiasm for the writings of 17th Century Jeremy Taylor . Bound by this quirk of taste , the old littrateur and the young clerk became close friends . After 17 years as Smith 's apprentice and companion , that clerk , Robert Gathorne-Hardy , has written a fascinating memoir of his master 's life . <P> Soon after their meeting Smith offered Gathorne-Hardy an allowance so that he could do his own writing and help compile more Trivia . Two strings were attached : " I was not to get married ; and I must not attempt to write bestselling novels . " Gathorne-Hardy was not the sort of man to flinch before either condition . <P> But his life as a combination assistant and disciple was no bed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps unwittingly , a murderous indictment of a spoiled and kittenish aesthete . Gathorne-Hardy was allowed plenty of free time , but Smith often made his life miserable with his whims and pouts , especially during his intermittent bouts of melancholia , which he called his " interlunaries . " And his penchant for repeating anecdotes would drive Gathorne-Hardy to otherwise unmotivated trips to the washroom . <P> Beautiful Phrases . Smith lived in the quiet conviction that the world was organized to satisfy his wants . Once he wrote to his disciple : " . . . a beautiful phrase is the most important thing in the world . . . nothing else really matters . " Since this sentence was written in total sincerity , it may explain why Smith could never enter into any deep relationship with either people or literature .
