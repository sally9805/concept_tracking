A MORMON CHRONICLE : THE DIARIES OF JOHN D. LEE ( 1848-1 876 ) - Edited by Robert Glass Cleland &; Juanita Brooks - Two volumes ( 824 pp. ) - The Huntington Library ( $15 ) . <P> John D. Lee was so bad at spelling that he called his diary his " Diarhea . " This makes no odds , because by any other name Lee 's Diaries would still remain one of the most extraordinary documents ever written by an American . <P> This fact has not been recognized before simply because Lee 's Diaries have never been published , except for short bits . California 's Huntington Library acquired the manuscripts in 1929 from the descendants of the man to whom Lee gave it a few days before his death . Edited and footnoted with care and devotion ( but indifferently indexed ) , the Diaries are unquestionably an important historical find . <P> Utah &; the Saints . John D. Lee was born at Kaskaskia , Ill. in 1812 . His background was Roman Catholic , but in 1838 he became a Mormon and was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee recognized and obeyed only two superiors-God Almighty and Brigham Young . If these two seemed to differ , then Lee went along with Young as the man who knew more than God about Utah and politics . So when the Mormons decided to press southward to establish new cities and expand the Kingdom of the Saints , Young made Lee one of the principal leaders of the expedition . And Lee knew exactly what his duty was . He was to be fruitful and multiply , so that the hosts of Mormon might cover the face of the earth . Helped ( according to the best estimates ) by 19 wives , Lee obeyed-to the extent of some 65 children , plus uncounted adoptions and conversions . <P> Lee " carried from 2 to 3 colts Revolvers " and knew how to use them . He was a wagoner , a cobbler , a woodsman , a cattle breeder , a farmer , a doctor of sorts who could perform a " surguicicle operation , " an impassioned preacher , a shrewd businessman , a layer-on of hands , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughest men that ever walked , but the Indians ( who ate out of his hand ) named him Yawgawts , which means Cry-Baby ( Lee himself preferred to render it " Man of Tender Passions " ) , and his foster-father once exhorted him , saying : " I want you to be a Man &; not -a Baby . " Was there in Lee 's devotion something soft , visible only to canny captains and savages ? There seems to have been-and tragedy was destined to be born from it . <P> Houses &; Habitations . For many years , all went well with John D. Lee . His Diaries begin with the famed westward march of the " Camp of Israel " to the Great Salt Lake-a moving mass of covered wagons , horses , mules , cows and oxen rolling over the " dusty and verry hot " trails . He records the daily search for precious pasture and fresh " waiter , " the inevitable fevers , pains , accidents , deaths and childbirths .
