In epic public give-and-take , at long diplomatic dinners and in late evening dacha talks , the Vice President of the U.S. spent more time with the Boss of the Soviet Union last week than any other American statesman in cold-war history . Around the world the rustlings and whisperings of regular diplomacy all but came to a halt while the chancelleries cocked their ears toward Moscow . In Moscow , oddly enough , there were no negotiations at all in the orthodox diplomatic sense , but there were loud , serious , deadly earnest debates about the resources and strengths of the West and Communism . " One reason for the length of the debates , " cabled TIME Correspondent Charles Mohr from Moscow , " is that Khrushchev finds it hard to believe that he can not top Nixon , and so he keeps trying . Nixon on his own part has not been able to top Khrushchev , either . " <P> In one aspect the Nixon visit was just more evidence of the East-West thaw , the cultural exchange flow that has taken thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , athletes and tourists from one side of the Iron Curtain to the other . But the Nixon trip was more than that . The thaw , as envisioned by the Russians , would leave the U.S. so impressed with Soviet good intentions that the West would settle for harsh Soviet terms for peace . Nixon added something new to the exchange : assurance that the U.S. has its own goals , aims and ambitions for the orderly development of the world , is ready to fight to keep them from being chewed away , is ready to negotiate only if they are respected . <P> This notice of intentions-elaborately written in the language of peace and plenty at the American fair , convincingly repeated in the language of unashamed power by Nixon-was the essence of the new diplomacy . It riled some old-style folks . Huffed the London Daily Express : " A disgraceful performance . . . Back to the days of secret diplomacy is the best prospect for world peace . " <P> There was certainly no guarantee that the new diplomacy would assure peace . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if it served to correct assumptions on both sides , to sort out myths from facts , then at least it would give the old diplomacy a new starting point that would make some sense .
