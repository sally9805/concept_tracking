I Traded My Desk for a Tropical Isle CANTON ISLAND , PHOENIX GROUP , Sou'ru CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN . N trl ' too long ago , whenever I had a free min- ute , I 'd wander over to the window of a Chicago law office , look down at yachts moored in Lake Michigan . and do a little dreaming . I was a legal secretary , and the dreams were just about normal . That is I.o say , I could just see myself on one of t hose yachts , leaning over the bow while blue water lapped against the hull and dark-skinned natives of some faraway South Pacific island grinned at me from a coral beach , This morning I stepped out on the bridge of the steel yacht Caronia ? 140 feet long and one of the finest in the Pacific  --  and yawned . I had a choice . I could look northeast toward Hawaii , 1900 miles away across electric-blue water , or 1300 the other way , toward Fiji . The lagoon was glassy , the sun intense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck . From the coral-sand beach , Baio , a dark and muscular Gilbertese , showed white teeth in a smile before he flapped across the dock in canvas shoes three sizes too big and clambered aboard to begin his day as the yacht 's househoy . Nobody feels sorry for a girl on a yacht , and I 'm not looking for either sympathy or praise . I have n't done anything that any good secretary could n't do  --  if she were willing , for example , I o run a freshwater still all night which I did last night ; did n't mind having a Polynesian mother rat move into her filing cabinet one now lives happily in mine ) and could get a real thrill out of a pile of steel scrap thirty feet high and three hundred feet long . i just walked over , put a hand on our pile of scrap , warm to the touch from the tropical sun , and acquired goose pimples of excitement from the act . To me , that steel is money and even more important than coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living at Canton Island , where the cowries come in colors on the reef , barracuda play beyond the iridescent breakers , and the wreck of the liner President Taylor used to he a landmark . It is n't a landmark any more . The onetime roundthe-world cruise ship now is a cut-down bulk , rapidly becoming additional tonnage in that pile of steel on the island . After twelve years with fish swimming in and out of her engine rooms , the tired old ship is ready for the end . So , frankly , are the rank amateurs who started cutting and tearing at her a year and a half ago , full of more hope than experience , their special skills still to be learned . Although I have n't handled a cutting torch or hoisted steel out of the hulk , I 'm one of those amateurs and proud of it .. All of us have had some fun and learned a great deal . Now we may even make some money . Unlike most yachting dreams , this yachting reality has no special Prince Charming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing an unusual job , in an unbelievable setting , with methods dreamed up from clay to day and the tools we could find 2000 miles from anywhere important . This story of two ships and a score of conglomerated people properly begins on February I4 , 1942 , when the 522-foot , 10,000-ton President Taylor , loaded with 1200 soldiers and mountains of supplies , tried to stand close inshore at Canton Island to avoid a reported Japanese submarine . While her accompanying destroyer scurried off to drop a depth-charge pattern , the Taylor touched bottom . And a heavy swell forced her hard aground . These were the dark days of World War II . Little help was available for a vessel stranded on isolated Canton , which is nothing hut . a flattish rim of sand and coral surrounding a pork-chop-shaped lagoon , 166 miles south of the Equator and beloved of nobody in all its lonesome history . This island  --  or rather , this series of islets surrounding the varicolored water of the lagoon ? is a blinding thing in an empty sea . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sheer white of it is relieved only by pale pinks from the billions of broken shells which litter it .

The salt-sea-girt island parches for lack of drinking water , and not hing ever happens in the limitless circle of the horizon . In all the world , there are Few more lonesome parcels of land . For the 1200 soldiers on hoard the Taylor , the grounding meant very I it I le . They had been assigned to Canton weeks before , and this accident only hurried their landing . The men , most of whom were to come to hate the place with h ferocity in the next four years , went ashore to build an airfield on the high  --  that is , about twenty feet above high-tide level  --  north end , one of the few spots where coral has raised the reef enough so that it always is out of water . The Taylor 's cargo was removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps burned themselves out . Nothing worked . By March eighteenth . the chief engineer sadly reported , " All pumps were secured and machinery and boiler spaces were allowed In fill to sea level . " There the Taylor stayed , a mockery to homesick soldiers and later a curiosity to airline passengers who , using Canton as a refueling and rest stop between Hawaii and Fiji , have the only continuing interest in the island . Canton is a condominium of Great Britain and the United States , with representatives of both governments present since it acquired airline importance in the 1930 's . These , with a few airlines employees and Gilbertese brought here as laborers  --  there are no natives  --  continued to fish in the sea around the stranded Taylor and occasionally picnicked aboard her after the war . The ship , built for the transatlantic trade in 1921 as the Granite Slate  --  also later named the President Polk  --  now was only a line in the United States Hydrographic Office 's sailing directions , which declared : ?

Of all this , Jeanne Booth Johnson  --  that 's me  --  was entirely unaware at the time . Convent-raised , I 'd been working toward the status of a permanently peripatetic office worker . This itching-foot tendency had carried me from jobs in Dallas , Texas , to a war-time assignment with the Army Engineers , I hence to Chicago . As an amateur artist , I had a natural interest in the sea and ships , but never even got close to either one until I made another job change  --  this one taking me to Portland , Oregon , and a lumber firm .

Thus , by the time the Eisen-bower Administration found out about the 7000 Section 608 windfall cages , they were beyond the pale of the law , t hanks to a three-yearstatute of limitations . What irritated McKenna 's men additionally was that the FHA , in at least three cases of alleged bribery , had " investigated , " then held the reports until the statute of limitations had run . McKenna 's investigation also brought out that builders reciprocated by providing FHA employees with " windfalls " annually on December twenty-fourth . There was evidence that 633 employees had accepted gifts from builders . In one office the director considered this in poor taste , so he ordered his staff to turn in their gifts to him .

Cooney , an energetic individual who sold a lot of lumber , but had one had habit ? looking out . the office windows to the west with a dreamy expression on his face . He also bad an interest in a ship . And what a ship she was ! The Caronia , a 296-Lon , steel , diesel-powered yacht , was built in 1927 as the Corneco for Ross Judson , of the Continent al Motors Company , at a reputed cost of $750,000 , and renamed by George Machric , of Los Angeles .

The Navy sold her to a tourist-bus company which planned to use her as a sight-seeing craft , hut . natty gave up in t he face of her abused condition . AL this point , Cooney and friends entered the picture . After some preliminary maneuvering , the yacht became the property of the North Coast Corporation , with Cooney as majority stockholder , M. L. Coulter 413 president , and H. C. Jacobson as secret arytreasurer . From 1949 to 1953 , all three also were laborers , working to put the yacht hack in her approximate original condition . Lying in Portland 's Willamette River all that time , she caused endless speculation that Oregon was to have a gambling ship off its rocky coast , and similar pipe dreams .

By October , starts on the building of new homes had hit n record peak for that month , and real-estate activity in general was brisk . This was due in no small measure to the new housing bill . For , while investigating FHA with one hand , Cole had produced a housing program with the other , as requested by Eisenhower at the beginning . He had also managed to steer the bill through Congress  --  at the height of the scandals ? in substantially the form the White House wanted . The most comprehensive housing hill ever passed in this country , it provides easier terms for buying new homes and fixing up old homes ; it sets up machinery for a more integrated slum-clearance program , and continues the public-housing program , among many of her things . By January . 1955 , the administration 's sweeping assault on the housing termites was showing concrete results . A nationwide grand-jury probe of Title I ordered by the Just ice Department already had reaped 300 indictments and 120 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits by wresting control from the hoards of directors of the involved corporations , in which the FHA holds the preferred stock . And the FHA itself was in the throes of a wholesale disinfecting process . having rid itself of twenty-seven officials and reprimanded twenty-five others in connection with the scandals . Perhaps more important was the fact that I he investigation had proved that But speculation was n't much more improbable than the unvarnished trut h . I typed the wonderful little ad which presently appeared in a yachting magazine . This read : &writ; PACIFIC CO  --  ADVENTURERS 1Nvi-rgis Group of young yachtsmen . holding clear title to large intact steamship stranded Sleuth Pacific island , will depart shortly in our OW n 300-ton motor vessel . on fl-month salvage operation ... could lake . . additional working partners willing lend their time and money in venture offering probable substantial profits to all concerned . Of course , a couple of things had happened before the advertisement was placed . Cooney and Coulter had looked over the wreck of the President Taylor , which , apparently , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporation had bought her , as was , where was , from the United States Maritime Administration , at public auction . The other development was that one brown-haired , female-type secretary had deal ( herself into this pot . Absolutely nobody 's going off on a Soul h Seas adventure and leave .1 . B. Johnson behind . Al that , I guess I was no special oddity among the assortment of personnel which presently waved back at Portland as the Caronia set sail , complete to a piano , seven staterooms and seven tiled baths . Actually , this was a seagoing partnership with ten men and Yours Truly comprising Taylor Salvors , which possessed a charter of the Caronia , a contract for salvaging the President Taylor , and a yachtful of supplies , wives , children , dogs and problems . Bill Cooney , Maury Coulter and Herman Jacobson were Salvor partners f.l'rLi the Executive Branch can investigate itself , if so minded .

Revenue officials  --  all of which now seems small potatoes compared with the FHA affair . After taking 5,000,000 words of testimony , Chairman Homer Capehart , of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , estimated the total windfall profit figure at $1,000,000,000 . He called it " the biggest scandal in the history of the Unit ed States , both in number of individuals participating and amount of money involved . " Oddly , because the first man to he ousted was a Republican appointee , Hollyday , some people got the idea it was an Eisenhower Administration scandal . Hollyday , by the way , reaffirmed his fait h in the administration and , oddly , even became a registered Republican after his forced resignation , but complained that he should have been given a hearing by Sherman Adams . Some Democrats on Capitol Hill jeered at the Republicans for getting excited about the windfall profits , arguing t hat for years they had called at-tent ion to Section 608 as being an invitation t o profiteering . But Cole pointed out that the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt the frauds by changing the law , tightening regulations or checking on administration officials . " The real answer is : when we had the opportunity , we did the job , " he adds . as well as the officers of the North Coast Corporation . Cooney was the spark plug , the operating manager and the largest investor in both . He also was one of the few partners who had any experience in the South Pacific , where he had been with naval amphibious forces during the war . Coulter was our engine and rigging specialist , a thirty-five-year-old veteran of Alaska construction jobs , looking for something to challenge his ingenuity . Dark and quiet Herman Jacobson was our welding and steel-cutting expert , faced now with a situation in which he could not use oxygen torches  --  no way to get enough oxygen to Canton Island ? but must depend on a new , comparatively untested process involving only carbon electrodes and compressed air , with high-amperage generators . This he not only had to adapt to ship salvage but must teach other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called an odd lot , volunteers all ; some in answer to that magazine advertisement . Capt . John Olsen was the ship 's skipper  --  twenty years at sea , but without salvage experience . Lawrence Benjamin was a radio operator with a liking for unusual jobs ; Edward E. Kaiser , Jr. , a twenty-five-year-old , precise , former hank employee ; William H. Wilson , twenty-three , an artist ; Carl Timm , Jr. , also twenty-three , a marine veteran and deep-sea diver ; Everett Miller , twenty-one , graduate of a college chefs ' course ; and Donald J. Boyer-Barnes , twenty-four , a British naval architect . I had no special personal qualifications except that I did n't get seasick , while almost all the other first voyagers did , including the cook . Also aboard were Dorothy Cooney and three Cooney daughters : Marjorie Lee , ten and very blonde ; Catherine Ann , a seven-year-old fish in the water ; and snub-nosed Carol Jean , a live-yearold tomboy with an interest in everything . Rita Jacobson brought along the Jacobson sons ; Keith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-year-old . Margaret Olsen watched over her four-year-old twins , Jorn and Eric . With paid engineers and mate , we totaled twenty-five persons . Later , we were joined by Ulysses S. Herrington , forty-one , a former sawmill operator who had helped to salvage some ships off the Texas coast , with his wife and four children ; and by Frank Ruainas , a bearded veteran of Pacific construction projects . Both came in as partners in Taylor Salvors . Adventures have a habit of going less than smoothly , and ours was anything but dull from the beginning . Rita Jacobson became ill and had to be put ashore at Astoria , Oregon , her husband accompanying her to a hospital , where she had an emergency operation . The two boys stayed aboard , in the care of Dorothy Cooney and me . Seasickness kept Margaret Olsen and several of the men in their bunks  --  and kept me in the galley until Everett Miller decided that he was n't going to die , after all . But neither that nor our brief stop at Honolulu did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , just had to see Canton as soon as possible . Excitement increased upon our first radio contact with the island . Immediately , Canton demanded to know whether Captain Olsen was authorized to perform marriages between Americans . The captain had no idea , so much radio yakking was necessary before some official in Hawaii assured him that he definitely could officiate . Even by radio , you could hear Canton 's sigh of relief . Mary Davis had flown down from Honolulu to marry Ross Perkins , but the minister had missed the plane and now could n't get reservations for a month . What with limited housing and nobody on the island authorized to make a marriage legal , things had come to a pretty pass . Captain Olsen saved the day . We also discovered a second reason for the fervent welcome the Caronia received as soon as we sighted the flat and sun-baked acreage which was to be home and headquarters . Canton is served only by air mail except when some occasional ship heads that way . We had 1290 pounds on hoard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved our magazines and parcel post more . We finally docked the Caronia inside the lagoon , all of us on edge to board the Taylor , which was the most prominent thing in a land- and seascape without other large interruptions . When I finally boarded the Taylor , I 'll confess that the excitement of adventure had to fight to stay alive . The wreck was a rusty and buckled haven for spooks and not much else . A fire  --  still unexplained  --  had burned through amidships in 1949 . This actually made the dismantling somewhat easier , but it certainly did n't help the Taylor 's appearance . Ash and burned streamers of SATI rIIDAY wood blocked passage through the dining salon and staterooms . Rust boiled everywhere . Rickety iron ladders through holds long open to the weather provided the only routes from deck to deck . Depths of the ship were echoing caverns , gurgling with the sound of water in the engine rooms . Rifle and machine-gun shells lit tered the decks . But in one never-before-opened hold was one thing really interesting  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze which did n't require anything except shipment . Eventually , this was sold for $677 , a surprise advance dividend . This was a working adventure , so Jake  --  who had rejoined us at Honolulu ? and some of the partners immediately started cutting off the Taylor 's upper works . They also repaired an elderly fifty-foot landing craft , so badly rusted in the tropics that patches had to be made with light plates burned off the Taylor . With another crew , Bill Cooney set up a shore high line . Steel started going over the liner 's side to the landing craft , from there via high line to a spot . on shore . There scurrying crabs were evacuated for the beginnings of that pile of scrap which now occupies a block-long strip of sand . Aboard the Caronia life quickly evolved into a routine . Captain Olsen and his family soon returned to the States because of Mrs. Olsen 's health . but other families settled for a long stay . Children trooped from the Caronia over the dock to the Canton Island school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating and the working crews fed , water and fresh food were the two main problems . At first , we could obtain fresh water only by ferrying barrels of it from an airline fresh-water still on the south end of the island in our landing craft  --  the Caronia could n't travel safely in that part of the lagoon  --  and paying three cents a gallon . This made for interesting bills ? $1400 in one five-month period  --  and required both time and labor . In desperation , we finally purchased a surplus water still from British government representatives on the island for $366 . This would manufacture 3000 gallons in twenty-one hours for about twelve dollars , compared to the ninety dollars purchase cost for this much water . Set up on the dock , this monster was enough to frighten an en- . gmeer , however . One of our technician partners took a long , careful look at detailed operating instructions . Then he said , - This manual is simple . The Army figured t , that if a smart man went . to a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand a little of what it was talking about . But there 's one good chapter  --  on demolition . If we study that , I think we can figure out how to blow it up . " But we had to make it work , so we did . The salt-water pump went haywire once ; other parts have shuddered to a stop numerous times . But it runs . You 'd like a quiet night on a starlit tropical lagoon ' ? Come along some night when the still 's complicated pumps are complaining , and gasoline engines operating that and El diesel generator , on the other side , are competing . Sit between them , as I often do , and you have real tropical relaxation . Or you would , if you could hear yourself think . Also a water shortage makes for interesting showers . More than once I 've stepped into mine , dirty , sweaty and drooling for that nice needle spray ? only there is n't any water . This means that I or somebody else has forgotten it . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's only n nett ter of switching tanks or priming n line . If it is n't , you 're in fora long night by the and you might get a shower tomorrow . Nevertheless , 1 enjoy that monster . I may not know quite how it does what it dots , but I can ! mike it work ? more interesting than a typewriter any day . Food on Canton all commute , For one thing , the island has only a few sickly palms . For another , people running cutting torches ? or , for I hal matter , secretaries working on the books  --  get awfully I ired of eat ing out of cans . On the Caronia , we brought supplies for eight months , but have been here twice that long . This imams that we 've begged , borrowed , scrounged and paid prices which would make even a New York City housewife cringe . From New Zealand , forty-cents-perpound air freight on meats makes a **25;230;TOOLONG chicken , F.O.B. , come a little high when it flies off the plane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some things can be obtained from air-line supplies , but irregularly . I was completely wrong in my advance notions on island living , so far as general supplies were concerned . I expected nothing , but found whimsey rather than scarcity . The island has two open-air theaters , three clubs and a hotel with a French chef . The air-line store provides cold soft drinks , soap . Aloha shirts , film , cigarettes , typewriters and camerae , sunglasses . shoestrings and sandals , all below mainland prices . But a typist who runs out of ribbon must make do with a used one from a message machine . And I found part of the paper on which this is typed in an abandoned foxhole on the old military perimeter . There are plenty of lighter flints , but lighter fuel always is short . If you do n't need anything special , you can live very well . If you want something special , you do without . While we learned to live at the island , the salvagers were making headway with the Taylor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t wo holds had been patched and made watertight . Our first salvage plan had been to cut down the superstructure to lighten the ship , to patch up and refloat what remained , finally towing her to Formosa or Japan for sale . But adventure has a way of getting fouled up with finance . Ours hit a snag when a marine survey indicated that the Taylor was ready to float , but simultaneously recommended against insurance because of a transverse crack and buckling amidships . This left Taylor Salvors in a nasty dilemma . The hull was worth $240,000 at Formosa . But towing without insurance would cost half of that , leaving not too much to divide after a year 's expenses were deducted . If the poor old Taylor sank  --  as well she might ? we 'd have no income and still owe both North Coast Corporation , for the Caronia charter , and the tug company 's full fee . The alternative was to cut up the ship entirely at Canton , selling the scrap steel to buyers who would come to Canton for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until spring , when the underwriters ' refusal of our risk became definite . Then it split our partnership wide open . Captain Olsen and Larry Benjamin already had left us , for personal reasons , although Olsen retained his financial interest . Miller , Boyes-Barnes , Wilson , Timm , Kaiser and Herrington agreed to sell out for immediate cash payments sufficient to get them home , the remainder due ? their investments , THE SATI.111114V plus allewances for t heir time and labor ? to he paid from the first sales of the scrap . This left a smallergroure the Cooneys , I he Jacobsons ? Rita had rejoined us at Canton after recovering from her operation ? Coulter , Ruei Inks , Olsen as nineive partner , and , of course , I lint intrepid , wide-eyed type , J. B. Johneon . To replace lost meml iere of the working crew , we hired C ilhertese , who were trained to handle winches and even to operate the complicated cult ing lurches .

Right now , the finances of Taylor Salvors would n't set any banker 's heart on fire . First-year outlay of $60,000 is just about balanced by proceeds of three small shipments of nonferrous metals , plus that one wonderful extra propeller blade and six others on which we had counted . plus 61100 gallons of salt-water-damaged fuel nil sold as road nil  --  you never know what may lie salable from a wrecked ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on I he island .

So even if we average only thirty dollars . we should net $48,000 , minimum , for what 's already cut and stacked . We figure there 's another $200,000 worth of scrap in the vessel , plus special items worth perhaps a total of $15,000 in all . But I have not ordered any fur coats yet on my personal financial prospects . Existing discouragements have very little to do with the price of scrap metals .

Just think of all t he islands I have n't seen yet ' When I think about them , I 'm tempted to bicycle over to the windward side of the island , away from everything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just sit and doze ? which is always a lot of fun to do down here by the Equator . But . unfortunately , that ca n't be done today . The Caronia 's almost out of fresh water , people want showers and somebody has to start the still . That somebody is Adventurous Jeannie.
