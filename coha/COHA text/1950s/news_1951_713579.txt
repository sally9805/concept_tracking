ADAMS , EVA WILLIAMS , Letters to The Times New York 's Civil Defense Official Reviews Recent Remarks on Proposed State Legislation To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In THE TIMES of Jan. 31 appears a letter , addressed to the editor , by Norman Thomas , in relation to the proposed civil defense bill now before the State Legislature . The letter was undoubtedly prompted , at least in part , by an article published in THE TIMES on Jan. 26 , which inaccurately characterized my remarks before the Municipal Section of the State Bar Association on the morning of Jan. 25 . In speaking before the Municipal Section of the Bar Association I reviewed the progress we have made in New York State in municipal government in the last five years and briefly discussed the important problems now confronting our municipalities . Among the problems I included civil defense . I reported factually the results of the conference on the civil defense legislation in Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The discussion , I said , had divided along four lines a . The pattern of the organization ; b . The grant of powers and the imposition of duties and their distribution ; c . The timing of such grant of powers and imposition of duties ; d . The financing of civil defense . There was a general agreement at the Albany conference that the pattern of the organization proposed in the bill was not objectionable to the municipal representatives and that whatever problems existed in this area could be resolved by practical administration . Some questions had been raised with respect to the grant of powers and it had been urged that there be a more precise definition of such terms as " attack " and " defense effort . " These and similar problems were referred to subcommittees to work out . Objection had been raised to the conscription powers under the bill . Several alternative suggestions were made for a " timetable " for the exercise of these powers . I said we had not solved the problem of financial relationship because we were uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financing local civil defense activities . At the conference , I said , we had discussed the problem of liability for injuries to persons and property damage and that this problem was now being studied with the hope that a solution could be offered at the next meeting of the group . Because I was speaking before a group of municipal attorneys , I said that one of the members of the conference group ( who was also present at the meeting of municipal attorneys before whom I was speaking ) had stated that we should give more emphasis to the fact that a substantial portion of the pending bill had been derived from the previous defense acts . I did not defend the bill nor assert that criticisms of it are unjustified or without merit , either at the conference of municipal representatives at Albany or before the Municipal Section of the Bar Association at New York . At both meetings I commended the local representatives for their constructive attitude and said that , with their help and with the help of similar groups of our citizens , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

A Soldier 's View To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wonder just what kind of people I left back home when I enlisted to help fight the Reds and keep them from the shores of our country . I never wanted to come back and fight , any more than thousands of other men in the Reserves and Regulars who are over here now . But we will fight and do our best to keep the things that we all cherish , our freedom of speech , press , religion , and everything else that America stands for . You can imagine how we feel when we hear news from home about strikes and people wanting more wages and shorter hours . Somehow it seems that the folks do n't care about whether we win this war for our very lives . They seem to only want to make more money and have more time to take it easy . To me , it seems that the thing to do would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike and demand more wages wo n't he taken from us by our- enemies . We should get the war over and done with or we will never again get the chance to strike and enjoy the freedoms of our country . Maybe I have n't heard all the news and all there is to hear on the subject , maybe I am all wrong . I hope I am . Because I have always believed that our people are behind us 100 per cent . I hone I shall always be able to believe that . CLYDE L. STANNARD . Overseas , Feb. 2 , 1951 . Plan to Collect Usable Clothing To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Sporadically , all sorts of organizations are starting and completing successful collections of used clothing for relief both here and abroad . Some few groups , ours included , have a permanent collection set-up , and that seems to be the only really satisfactory way under present world conditions . Too many thousands of pounds of perfectly usable clothing are being thrown into ashcans and incinerators daily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destitute and homeless persons , most especially children , everywhere from Korea to Berlin , front Rome to our own Navajo reservations . Recently , Save the Children Federation and the Boy Scouts completed remunerative collections of used clothing , especially in the schools and churches . In order to make reasonably certain that no used and still valuable clothing be wasted , and after discussion with many leaders in the same field , I propose that our city ' fathers order that our schools be requested to collect such wearing apparel . Make collections a permanent institution , and thus make it possible for New Yorkers to clothe literally millions with their discards . The clothes thus collected should be turned over to non-sectarian national organizations such as those mentioned above , so that no one may be accused of partiality .

Use of Man-Made Fibers Emergence of Synthetics With the Properties of Wool Pointed Out To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There is an irresistible movement throughout the textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is sparked by the dual drawbacks to cotton , wool and silk that come from their being subject to fluctuating production as natural fibers and speculative price control . In the short span of forty years man-made fibers have attained ascendancy in the field once held by silk ; in the same period of time the number of types of chemical yarns has grown to include those adaptable to use with cotton and as out-and-out synthetics . The volume of all such chemically produced filament yarns and staple fibers made in this country totaled over 1,400,000,000 pounds for 1950 . Now another field of conquest has opened to man-made fibers by the development of synthetics that have the feel and many of the inherent properties that are found in wool . The challenge for an important part in this division of the textile industry is being met by many mill men in the same way that the silk industry met the situation when it was confronted by a competitor . Sweeping statements are made by wool advocates that no successful alternative fiber has been produced . The market place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-made fibers are being used extensively to supplement wool and as the raw material for 100 per cent synthetic fabrics . Demand is no respecter of persons , traditions or markets . It calls for action and wants results . This is one of the prime reasons why fibers that have the wool feel and functional properties are writing a new chapter in textiles today . Your editorial " Disappearance of ' All Wool ' " may have come as a shock to F. Eugene Ackerman , president of the Wool Bureau , but there is evidence throughout the textile market that woolen and worsted mills are making blended fabrics that are described , in some instances , as high as 80 per cent rayon , 20 per cent wool , and sold on their merits . There are other fabrics that are made for apparel and domestic use that are of 100 per cent synthetic fiber content . There is no secret superiority in wool that can deny a share in the textile market to man-made fibers that meet the physical requirements and that have the added advantage of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in price . The movement in industry is away from crafts and precarious sources of supply to scientific development and market stability . Wool is definitely giving ground to man-made fibers . FRANCIS A. ADAMS . Editor , Rayon and Synthetic Textiles . New York , Feb. 6 , 1951 . Need for World Government To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Listening to the wrangling on both sides in the U. N. convinces one that there will never be any peace unless and until world government is adopted . Power politics , which the United States and Russia practice , will have to be supplanted by international cooperation . National sovereignty is little enough to give up in exchange for world order . Let us hope that this comes about before the outbreak of another senseless holocaust . The United Nations should be strengthened now to help bring about world government and save humanity from the abyss toward which it is headed for lack of the right leadership . EVA WILLIAMS .
