LETTERS OF JAMES JOYCE ( 437 pp. ) - Edited by Stuart Gilbert-Viking ( $7.50 ) <P> James Joyce , the great artificer of words who both revitalized and nearly destroyed the English novel with Ulysses , and left even some of his admirers behind in the labyrinth of Finnegans Wake , will not be remembered for his letters . In them he sounds as relaxed , colloquial , and sometimes as pedestrian as a chatty uncle in Chicago . But they make fascinating reading-something like seeing the Bearded Lady without her whiskers or the Fire Eater spooning ice cream . <P> This collection contains a few selected letters to Joyce as well as hundreds from him . The first , written in 1901 when Joyce was 19 , is a reverent birthday greeting to Henrik Ibsen and glows with optimism about the dawning age of " enlightenment . " The last , written in 1940 , three weeks before Joyce 's death , is a note of thanks to the mayor of Zurich for giving Joyce and his family asylum from the Nazi war machine . It reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightenment has fallen . <P> " Who the Hell Is Joyce ? " Such ironies were commonplace in Joyce 's life . Few men have had to struggle harder-against illness , insensitivity , poverty , misunderstanding and bustling ignorance . Job-Joyce 's trials are traced in the letters . His short-story collection , Dubliners , was " rejected by 40 publishers . " Ulysses , banned in Britain and kept out of the U.S. as " obscene , " was pirated by publishers . Finnegans Wake was denounced as a book written " by a lunatic for lunatics . " H. G. Wells arrogantly wrote Joyce : " You have in your composition a mighty genius for expression which has escaped discipline . . . So I ask : Who the hell is this Joyce who demands so many waking hours of the few thousands I have still to live for a proper appreciation of his quirks and fancies ? " <P> Faced by such lack of comprehension , Joyce complained : " Writing in English is the most ingenious torture ever devised . The English reading public explains the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters show Joyce as a man drunk on language . He had the gift of tongues ( just for fun , he dashed off translations of a poem by James Stephens in German , Latin , Norwegian , Italian and French ) . His view of himself was generally rueful , whether he was commenting on his physical " cowardice " or remarking on his " steely cheerfulness in what does not afflict me personally . " He read hugely , but at times with so little discrimination that his head felt full of " pebbles and rubbish and broken matches and lots of glass picked up ' most everywhere . ' " When he was losing his eyesight he devoted hours to reading Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , but lost patience after two pages of a book about D. H. Lawrence 's sex-ridden Lady Chatterley 's Loner . The critique was , he thought , a piece of propaganda " in favour of something which , outside of D.H.L. 's own country at any rate , makes all the propaganda for itself .
