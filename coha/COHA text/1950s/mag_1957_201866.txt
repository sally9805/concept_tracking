ALL OUT OF STEP ( 316 pp. ) - Gerard B. Lambert-Doubleday ( $4.50 ) . <P> The venerable employee of the Lambert Pharmacal Co. , makers of Listerine , opened his book of news clippings and said : " It says in the British Lancet that in cases of halitosis . . . " <P> " What 's halitosis ? " interrupted Gerard Lambert , the company 's general manager . " Oh , that is the medical term for bad breath , " said the employee . <P> Before anyone could say " Listerine , " Lambert " bustled the dear old gentleman out of the room " and soon , with glistening eyes , he was punching out Listerine 's first , fine , fetid halitosis ad . That was in 1922 . Ever since , says Lambert in this rousing , readable autobiography , " I have had the fear that my tombstone will bear the inscription , ' Here lies the body of the Father of Halitosis . ' " Today , thanks to impish Gerard Barnes Lambert , the world is full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of Chaucer 's Wife of Bath . Soon , only toothless oldsters will remain to tell of a time when every bridesmaid took her breath in her stride and no man , wanting the truth , went to a child . <P> Peerless at Princeton . Listerine was the creation of Lambert 's father , a chemist who developed the antiseptic formula ( useful in that it was bland and harmless to skin and other tissue ) . Father Lambert scraped together sufficient funds to get to London and there " invested his last dollar in an elegant carriage with a liveried coachman . " Helped by this haughty equipage , he coaxed from Lord Lister , the pioneer of antiseptic surgery , the right to christen the new formula with the great man 's name . <P> Listerine was still a small family affair when Gerard Lambert was born in 1886 . But the Lambert Pharmacal Co. was already rich enough to pop huge silver spoons in the mouths of all the little Lamberts . Their St. Louis home was full of the murmur of menservants , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were always two little colored girls ... to waft the flies from us with enormous peacock feathers . " When the time came for Gerard to go to Yale , he thought it would be wise to case the ancient joint before entrusting his person to it . Horrified by its soiled , congested appearance , Gerard entered Princeton , a place which to him really " looked like a university . " <P> Says he : " With certain qualifications , I was a lonely and shy boy . " Princeton seems to have brought out the qualifications . Lambert joined an eating club where , when the " food got too bad , we would upend a long table and shoot the whole mess through a window and out into the street . " He recalls : " It did not seem at all odd to have five rooms and finally , in my junior year , to have a limousine with a chauffeur . . . Now and then the chauffeur would drive me in my Peerless limousine . . . from my rooms to chapel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great delight . "
