It had been years since we were together for . the holidays . We arrived in the Illinois town lrst and waited in a hotel lobby , as was pre-arranged , for my Brother and his family . When they walked into the lobby , little Nlarilee was carrying Henry , an alley cat , in her arms . Unfortunately , I did n't spot the cat as quickly as our Sealyham terrier , . The dog lunged toward the cat , pulling his leash from my hand , and the two raced around the hotel lobby .

We bandaged our wounds , paid for a broken urn in the lobby , apologized to the manager , and started on our way . My brother and his family were in their car with Henry and we had in ours . Gift from Policeman We stopped for a meal later in the day and learned that a policeman in New York had handed Henry to the two girls just the day before they left for the trip .
