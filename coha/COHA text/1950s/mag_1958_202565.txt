All things come to him who serves in Congress , even responsibility for slaughtering hogs and cattle . Climaxing three years of hearings , debate and mountainous mail , the Senate last week passed ( 72-9 ) a bill condemning most U.S. packinghouses ' slaughtering methods as cruel and specifying " humane " techniques . <P> For the bill 's lobbyists , passage climaxed an uphill fight . Some 30 years ago , U.S. humane societies were aghast to discover that a steer being led to slaughter was first stunned by a hammer blow-often ineffectively-then slashed across the throat and allowed to bleed to death . Hogs were shackled by a leg to overhead conveyor belts , jabbed in their jugular veins , sometimes dumped alive into scalding water . The societies pressured meat packers into joining a committee on humane slaughter that achieved some innovations , e.g. , some packinghouses began using a captive bolt pistol , which fires a metal rod into the brain ; George A. Hormel &; Co. installed carbon-dioxide rooms where hogs were gassed before slaughter . But most packinghouses continued old methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , early this year got a bill through the House . <P> As the bill came up for Senate hearings , the meat-packing lobby warned that new techniques would mean higher meat prices and the Department of Agriculture criticized the law as fuzzy and hard to police . Although the bill exempted kosher slaughter , Orthodox Jews opposed it as interference with shehitah , the ritual for killing kosher animals . The humane societies rebutted other arguments by pointing out that such countries as Switzerland , The Netherlands and England administer similar laws , predicted that rather than raising prices , new techniques would help packers recover $50 million in meat lost a year through careless slaughter . <P> Said an Agriculture Department official , throwing up his hands : " You ca n't be for sin , and that 's what they make it out . " Making it out best was Christine Stevens , president of Manhattan 's Animal Welfare Institute and secretary-treasurer of the hard-lobbying Society for Animal Protective Legislation , and the humane societies ' most effective spokesman . Trim , greying Christine Stevens , 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own money ( Husband Roger Stevens produced Broadway 's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Time Remembered , once headed a syndicate that owned the Empire State Building ) to crank out publicity . <P> Christine Stevens wore down the opposition . The bill sailed through both houses , is in line for quick conference action and presidential signature . The Agriculture Department will enforce it . And packers probably will fall into line . Although the measure contains no noncompliance penalties , packers who hammer cattle and hoist conscious pigs are ineligible to bid on Government contracts . And the U.S. , purchasing $250 million worth of meat a year , is too big a customer to lose .
