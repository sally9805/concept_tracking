1 INT . EMERGENCY HOSPITAL LOBBY FADE IN There is a large bell on the white wall and below it a clock which points to five minutes to twelve . Under the clock is a desk at which sits the pretty nurse-receptionist , MARY BENNETT . As the CAMERA PANS DOWN on her she is smilingly fending off a pass from FRANK JESSUP , an engaging guy in a white uniform . He is not just being fresh : we feel the relaxed intimacy between them . &nbsp; MARYUnh-unh ! Take off before somebody runs a red light . I 'm hungry .

TREMAYNE HOUSE - NIGHT The ambulance men follow the Japanese manservant up the stairway and into the upper hall . Faintly , over scene , we HEAR a distant piano playing the theme piece . Halfway down the hall a door is a jar . Satsuma knocks , enters and stands by the door . Frank brushes past him into the big , beautifully furnished bedroom . Lying in bed is MRS . CATHERINE TREMAYNE . She is breathing very fast , gasping out her story to a police sergeant who is making notes . Leaning over her is the family doctor . He is about to administer a hypodermic .

The doctor looks round at the ambulance man . &nbsp; DOCTOR ( indicates resuscitator carried by Bill ) We wo n't need that . ( to Frank ) Stand by with the oxygen .

His eyes turn to the fireplace .

TREMAYNE HOUSE - UPPER HALL Frank walks along the hall and starts down the broad main stairway . The SOUND of the piano becomes clearer . The entrance hall is empty , but as Frank descends the last few steps , looking appreciatively about him at the signs of wealth and good taste , his eyes light on a sight that causes him to stop . Through an archway leading from the foyer he sees a girl ( DIANE ) seated at a grand piano at the far end of the music room . Frank 's eyes do not leave her as he takes the last few steps down into the hall and crosses slowly toward the archway . He stands watching her . She suddenly seems to feel his presence and stops her playing . Slowly she turns .

She puts both hands to the sides of her face  --  not trying to cover her eyes , but more as though she were clutching throbbing temples . The sobbing becomes almost strangled . &nbsp; FRANK ( cont 'd ) Hey ! He sets down the inhalator and crosses quickly to her . &nbsp; FRANK ( cont 'd ) Take it easy . ( puts a hand on her shoulder ) She 's okay , I tell you . Diane slams a hand down on the keys as she whirls round and jumps up , sweeping his hand off her shoulder . &nbsp; DIANELeave me alone !

His hand goes to his cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to stop hysterics. ( grins ) It does n't say anything about getting slapped back . Her eyes search his face , then she relaxes into a smile so unexpectedly sweet and charming that she is completely metamorphosed . &nbsp; DIANEI 'm sorry . &nbsp; FRANKForget it . I 've been slapped by dames before . . . ( grins ) usually for other reasons . She colors a little , becoming aware of him as a man , not as a piece of furniture or hospital equipment . &nbsp; FRANK ( cont 'd ) ( thumb toward upstairs ) She your mother ? &nbsp; DIANE ( curt - hard ) Stepmother . &nbsp; FRANK ( nodding ) Did n't think you looked alike .

Somehow she makes the words " next time " sound like a promise . Frank does n't miss the little inflection . He gives her a puzzled look as he goes . Diane stands looking after him .

Chiyo is scolding all the way in Japanese . &nbsp; CHIYO ( in Japanese ) Why do n't you carry some of this ? &nbsp; ITO ( in Japanese ) Stop complaining . It 's not heavy . They cross the court - where three cars are drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First car is Mrs. Tremayne 's convertible , next is the Jaguar and finally - in absurd contrast - the Itos ' jalopy , a vintage 1934 to 1938 Ford or Chevrolet , which no amount of washing or polishing can ever restore to brightness . Frank has been working on the Jaguar - with its hood raised . He has a wrench in his hand . He looks up and grins as Ito and Chiyo cross , heading for their own car . &nbsp; ITO ( cont 'd ) ( to Frank ) Heavy , she says . ( grins ) The only trouble with America it spoils the women . Chiyo has climbed in . She pokes her head out . &nbsp; CHIYO ( Japanese equivalent ) Oh yeah ! Ito climbs in , turns the key - STARTS the motor . Frank crosses to him . &nbsp; FRANKI put in a new set of spark plugs . . . I think it 'll work better now . The motor catches . There is a really horrible SOUND as it turns over , but the Itos like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . very . . . good . . .  --  82  --  He puts the car in gear with an awful CLASHING , and they start away . &nbsp; FRANK ( shouting after them ) Have a nice day ! He looks after them with an enigmatic expression , then shoots a glance at the house . He goes to the Jaguar and closes the hood , then hurries purposefully into the garage , wiping his hands on a rag as he goes . 66 INT . DIANE 'S BEDROOM ANGLE AT window - Diane is looking down into the courtyard , her expression watchful . &nbsp; CATHERINE 'S VOICE ( from the hall ) Chiyo , oh CHIYO ! 67 FULL SHOT Mrs. Tremayne opens the door .

She crosses the hall . &nbsp; CATHERINE'Bye , dear . . . Wish me luck ! She does n't pause , but continues across the hall - Diane not turning or pausing in her playing .

The switch is turned , she steps on the ignition  --  the accelerator  --  the car comes to life with a ROAR of full throttle and races backward . Catherine 's face is a mask of terror  --  but her scream is lost . Tremayne 's mouth flies open in a grimace of fright as he tries in vain to reach for some control . The car races back , hits some obstacle off  --  crashes through  --  and then o.s. we hear the avalanche SOUND of the huge roadster hitting on rocks  --  bouncing  --  metal crunching  --  rocks falling  --  the thundering CRASH and CRUNCH as it hits the bottom . . . A few stones fall , a little slide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the piano comes over more clearly  --  ever more clearly in the then-complete silence of death . 74 CLOSE SHOT Diane at piano .

Now you say that  --  strangely enough  --  some parts of this motor are missing or damaged . . . As I look at this heap of metal before me , I can only wonder that any of it has escaped undamaged . . . and as for missing parts , do you see a carburetor , or a fly-wheel ? &nbsp; MILLERNo sir .

Not in my opinion . If it had you 'd expect to see a part of the sheared-off cotter pin in one of the holes  --  or scratches or marks or some bending to show where it had pulled out . . . There was n't a sign . &nbsp; JURORExcuse me , but could I ask the witness a question ? &nbsp; BARRETTBy all means .  --  115  --  &nbsp; JUDGEYou may ask your question , but if it 's an improper one I 'll have to instruct the witness not to answer . &nbsp; JURORWell , is it improper to ask if maybe this cotter pin might n't have been defective ?

If you insist . &nbsp; DIANEI killed them both and Frank knew nothing about it . That is , he knew I hated Catherine . . . at least I did then  --  and he suspected me . I let him think he had talked me out of it . . . Then one day , when he was working on her car , I got him to explain how the automatic transmission worked  --  Am I going to fast ? &nbsp; MISS PRESTONNo . &nbsp; BARRETT ( hitting it ) So he did show you how to fix the car ! &nbsp; DIANENo , no , no ! . . . . But I know how to get things out of people . . . I 'm always asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and people are so accustomed to it , they answer  --  without thinking why I want to know . . . ( reminiscently ) He loves to talk about motors . . . &nbsp; BARRETT ( half convinced ) And you actually did it all by yourself ?  --  140  --  &nbsp; DIANEYes , on that Thursday . Frank left right after Ito and Chiyo . So before Catherine came down , it took only a few minutes  --  I did exactly what that Mister Miller described at the trial . &nbsp; BARRETTAt last ! A technical expert who knows his stuff ! ( easily ) Well , do you feel better now that it 's off your conscience ? &nbsp; DIANEIt will never be off my conscience , Mister Barrett  --  but now that Frank has left I have nothing to live for . &nbsp; BARRETTI ca n't believe he 's really serious about leaving you . No young man in his right mind is going to run away from a girl like you and a half-million dollar inheritance . &nbsp; DIANEHe 's gone to the girl he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . He did n't come home last night  --  so please let me sign that . Then you can take me to the district attorney and everything will be all right . &nbsp; BARRETTListen , Diane , once you 've been tried for a crime and acquitted , you can never be tried again or punished for it . &nbsp; DIANEBut I 'm guilty !  --  141  --  &nbsp; BARRETTIt does n't matter . The law calls it double jeopardy . You could sign that statement a dozen times before a dozen witnesses  --  you could shout it from the housetops or read it on the radio  --  and there is n't a thing anyone can do about it  --  no , I take that back  --  there is one thing  --  They 'd probably put you in an insane asylum . ( pause ) Do you want that ? Diane stares at him , then stands . Barrett gets up from behind his desk and crosses to where Miss Preston sits . He takes her notebook and rips out the few pages of her notes . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door . DISSOLVE pp. 90-117 &nbsp; pp. 142-145 105 EXT . TREMAYNE HOUSE - EVENING A taxicab pulls into the courtyard . Diane gets out , pays the driver . As the driver swings around , his headlights pick up the Jaguar standing in the garage . Diane sees it and hurries eagerly toward the garage . She looks at the car , then races around the side of the building and up the steps to Frank 's apartment . 106 INT . GARAGE APARTMENT - EVENING A radio newscast is on . Frank is in the bedroom . We see his shadow moving about . &nbsp; NEWSCASTER. . . and so , with her acquittal , Diane gets full control of the Tremayne estate  --  estimated at over half-a-million dollars  --  and it 's expected that she and her chauffevr-husband will spend part of that little nest egg on a honeymoon trip abroad . . . And that 's the news to now . . . So back to the Romance Ballroom . . .  --  142  --  During the latter half of this , Frank enters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair . He goes to a table  --  drops some keys , which he takes from his pocket . The dance MUSIC comes in over the radio , we hear Diane 's steps racing up the stairs and a second later she opens the door . She stands waiting for him to speak . &nbsp; FRANKYou won your bet all right . He goes to the table , picks up the keys he had dropped there , hands them to her . Her expression is bright again . &nbsp; FRANK ( cont 'd ) Thanks for the use of the car . &nbsp; DIANE ( high ) You need n't have packed . . . Ito could have brought your things over ! &nbsp; FRANK ( drily ) To Mexico ? That 's where I 'm going ! &nbsp; DIANEHave you ever been there ? He shakes his head . &nbsp; DIANE ( cont 'd ) It 's wonderful ! Mexico City  --  Acapulco !  --  the roof of the Casablanca ! Dancing under the stars ! . . . The night air is warm . . . and way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats  --  like fireflies . . . The orchestra is playing Clair De Lune and  --  &nbsp; FRANK ( breaking away ) Sorry , but my bus leaves in forty minutes .  --  143  --  &nbsp; DIANE ( not pretending now ) Frank . . . take me with you ! &nbsp; FRANKUnh-uh . Her arms go around him , fingers gripping him . &nbsp; DIANEI ca n't let you go , darling . I ca n't . &nbsp; FRANK ( forcing her hands away ) You never quit trying , do you ! &nbsp; DIANENo. ( she forces a little smile ) Will you give me forty minutes more  --  to try . . . ? Let me take you to the bus station . He shakes his head . &nbsp; DIANE ( cont 'd ) Please ! Please , darling ! Forty minutes ? &nbsp; FRANKWhat 's the use , Diane ? . . . It 's through , it 's finished . ( he looks at his watch ) We 've said everything there is to say . &nbsp; DIANEPlease ! This one last chance ? He shrugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but . . . okay .  --  144  --  &nbsp; DIANEI wo n't be a minute ! She runs from the room . Frank looks after her , then shakes his head . He crosses to the threshold and stands , looking into the room and to where the bed is . He looks a long time , then he flicks the light switch off . The MUSIC on the radio breaks into some Latin-American number . Frank looks at the radio , smiling a little quizzically at this second invitation to Mexico . He crosses to the radio , listens a moment and then  --  with decision  --  shuts it off . He feels in his pockets to make sure he has everything , takes a last look around the room , goes to pick up his suitcase and heads for the door . 107 EXT . COURTYARD AND GARAGE - EVENING Diane comes running from the house toward the garage , carrying a bottle of champagne and two glasses . She runs into the garage , climbs into the Jaguar , starts the motor and snaps on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes down from his apartment , carrying his suitcase . She cuts the motor and takes the keys from the ignition . Her manner is gay , bubbling . &nbsp; DIANEHere are the keys ! She tosses them when he is still a few feet away . He makes the catch . &nbsp; FRANKThanks . He continues to the back of the car , opens the trunk , stows his suitcase in it . Diane turns to watch him . &nbsp; DIANE ( hinting ) You know it would be exciting to drive this clear to Mexico . &nbsp; FRANKYeah. . . why do n't you do that sometime . . . ?  --  145  --  He returns to the car , spots the champagne bottle as he reaches to hand her the keys . &nbsp; FRANKWhat is this ? He picks the bottle up . She laughs . He takes the two glasses from the seat as he gets in . DURING THIS : &nbsp; DIANEI thought it might help change your mind . . . She puts the keys in the ignition , turns the switch . &nbsp; FRANKTwo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motor . &nbsp; DIANEMight as well begin sometime . . . The car slowly moves forward as Frank gets the cork free . &nbsp; FRANKHey , take it easy ! She stops the car and he starts to pour both glasses . Diane slams the car into reverse and gives it full throttle . Frank 's arms are jolted and the bottle of champagne flies into the air . His half-begun shout is lost in the full ROAR of the motor , as the car leaps back and hurtles over the cliff . FADE OUT THE END pp. 118-141 &nbsp;
