For weeks , Ira Cain , 42-year-old military editor of Amon Carter 's Fort Worth Star-Telegram , had been working to get a beat . He hoped to report the maiden flight at Fort Worth of Consolidated Vultee 's big , new YB-60 , the jet version of the B-36 bomber . <P> But last fortnight a planeload of Pentagon brass arrived at Convair 's Fort Worth plant , dropped a curtain of security over the flight date , and barred all reporters . Cain , a staffer for the afternoon Star-Telegram , drove his car as close as he could get to the test field , and for days kept watch , until colleagues began calling him " Audubon Cain , the bird watcher . " When he finally spotted the YB-60 in flight he could only swear ; it was too late to make his last edition , and the morning Star-Telegram , also owned by Carter , would get the break on the story . Then , in a flight of B-36s hovering high overhead , Cain saw something odd . One of the B-36s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was obviously either a rocket or jet fighter . <P> Cain excitedly realized that maybe he had stumbled on a better story than the YB-60 . But when he quizzed sources at Convair with " What did I see ? " he got only blank stares . Finally , as the Pentagon group started back to Washington , one officer told the persistent newsman : " Do n't write about it , and I 'll see if I can get it released . " <P> Last week came the Washington telephone call giving Cain his beat . The story : Convair has turned a B-36 and an F-84 jet fighter into a " motherdaughter " team . The B-36 serves as a mother ship for the fighter , carrying it partly inside , and can launch it in flight and pick it up again . Using the team , the long-range B-36 could carry a short-range but speedy fighter close to a target , release it to drop an atom bomb . As the wire services carried Cain 's story around the country , only one thing marred his pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband had refused to believe her when she told him several weeks before about the B-36 's new tricks . How she knew : a customer in the liquor store where she worked had told her all about it .
