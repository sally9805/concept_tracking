If a tuberculosis patient is depressed and apathetic , his disease is likely to get worse despite the best of medical care . If a patient is always tense and angry and bucks his necessarily slow treatment he is not apt to improve very fast . But if a depressed patient can be made to snap out of it by sudden fright or sudden anger , he will probably begin to get better right away . <P> Doctors , who have long known that there is a rough relationship between TB and the emotions , had these facts spelled out for them last week at the Los Angeles meeting of the National Tuberculosis Association . And with the spell-out , came a theory about the body mechanism which governs the relationship . <P> The mechanism appears to be located in the busy little adrenal glands , which secrete steroid hormones ( like cortisone ) , said Dr. Edmund R. Clarke Jr . of Seattle 's Firland Sanatorium . He and his colleagues tested the adrenal output of 109 TB patients . In general , those with abnormally low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near-normal levels had the commoner , less extensive form of the disease , while others with high levels had localized but stubborn infections . <P> Then , said Dr. Clarke , it was found that the low steroid levels marked the patients who were depressed , apathetic and withdrawn . The near-normals were alert , cooperative and interested in their surroundings . The above-normals were ridden with conflicts and anxiety and often showed such other signs as fast heartbeat , quick changes in blood pressure and sweating of the palms . <P> The adrenals pour out extra steroid hormones in times of stress or anger . How this can work to bring the depressed patient 's steroid output up to normal was described by Dr. Clarke in case histories : <P> One patient was getting no better , and in fact was being kept alive only by frequent injections of streptomycin . After a while he became so angry at being repeatedly jabbed with the needle that his adrenal output soared back to normal . Now he is recovering . <P> Another , also with underactive adrenals , was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients kidded him into believing that he was going to lose the whole lung . His undue fear sent his adrenal output up . And this helped him through the operation in good shape . <P> There is no such quick treatment for the resentful patients with chips on their shoulders and excessive adrenal output . But their tensions and hormones can sometimes be reduced gradually with the **26;14017;TOOLONG treatment from doctors , nurses and family .
