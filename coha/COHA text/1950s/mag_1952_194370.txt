Between the Baltic Sea and the Bavarian Alps , the U.S. , Britain and France have a string of air bases equal to any in the world . Inherited from the Nazis , the accommodations at these bases reflect the care that Hermann Goring lavished on his pet Luftwaffe . Runways ( extended by the jet-flying allies ) are long and smooth , operations buildings snugly efficient , living quarters furnished down to the last monogrammed china dinner service. * Only snag about the old German system of air bases : it faces the wrong way . The best of the fields , i.e. , those in the Reich 's rear areas , have two irremediable defects : 1 ) they are uncomfortably close to the Iron Curtain-many of them less than ten minutes by jet ; 2 ) their supply lines run back eastward toward Soviet Germany . " The U.S. Air Force in Germany , " cracked a U.S. staff officer after the fields had been taken over , " is ideally deployed to fight France . " <P> New Frontier . The only solution was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory on the west bank of the Rhine , far enough away from the Iron Curtain to give allied planes a chance to get into the air before being overrun by Russian Panzers . Slowly , painfully slowly , NATO began building a brand-new air frontier , 100 to 250 miles farther back , in France and the Low Countries . <P> <P> To pay for the new bases , NATO has already put up $750 million ( the U.S. share : about 40% ) and laid down plans for " standard bases , " designed to suit the operational requirements of all participating air forces . Specifications for the standard fields : 8,000-ft. runways ( a compromise between the U.S.A.F. 's demand for 9,000 ft. and the R.A.F. 's insistence that 6,000 ft. is plenty ) ; standardized lighting , storage and fueling facilities . Beyond these bare essentials , each air force builds its own barracks , canteens and bowling alleys-at its own expense . To get a standard airfield ready for occupation by Americans , the U.S. shells out an extra $12 to $18 million . <P> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their land ; wasteful engineering , hurry-up construction and sloppy workmanship resulted in lumpy , sagging runways that chipped under the weight of taxiing aircraft . Yet , one by one , good serviceable runways are being finished . Last week in the vital Central European Tactical Zone ( see map ) , there were three times as many 8,000-ft. runways as there were a year ago . By the end of 1952 , 60 big bases will be combat-ready . <P> Buildup . In France to investigate Washington reports of " slow progress , bad conditions and bottlenecks , " General Hoyt S. Vandenberg , U.S.A.F. Chief of Staff , found his crews living in damp , crowded tents , tramping across muddy fields to exhume crates of spare parts stacked in the open for lack of hangar space . Ground controllers still radio instructions to hovering planes from the backs of olivedrab trucks , parked near the runways . At the 48th Fighter Bomber 's bleak , bare base at Chaumont , the Chief of Staff saw <P> G.I.s , muffled in parkas , working in a slashing downpour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conditions are improving , and U.S. General Lauris Norstad , NATO air commander in Central Europe , promised to have every one of his men in warm hutments before winter sets in . Impressed after five days ' touring , Hoyt Vandenberg reported morale " damned good . "
