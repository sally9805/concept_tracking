txt A 2 year old boy fell 13 floors from his family 's apartment today and survived . The youngster , Marshall Harris , suffered a skull fracture and internal injuries . Harlem hospital officials said his condition is critical and it was a miracle that he was not killed . Two circumstances combined to save the boy . He dropped against a radio antenna extending from a seventh floor windowsill , checking the fall , and he landed on a clump of bushes , thus cushioning the impact . Marshall is the son of Sgt. Edward Harris , stationed in Korea , and his wife , Lucretia . ' Marshall was asleep in his crib when Mrs. Harris stepped over to a neighbor 's apartment for a few minutes . In her absence , the child awakened , climbed out of his bed , toddled to the windowsill , climbed it , and toppled out .
