At fit-out docks in two New England ports last week , weird green-painted boats lay shrouded in secrecy . Yard workmen swarmed along their bulging sides , finishing up their hulls , cramming their innards full of deadly equipment . One bore the name Trigger , the other the name Tang . They were the first of six new , fast attack submarines built for the U.S. Navy . <P> Shorter by 50 feet than the lean , 310-foot fleet " boats " of World War II , the new Tang-class subs looked like a cross between a whale and a shark . Gone was the familiar deck gun and the round conning tower , with its crest of periscopes , radar and radio masts . The decks of the new subs were clean and knife-narrow . Down the center reared a thick , sliced-off fin to house their twelve masts and the snorkel , which will enable them to run on engines instead of batteries at periscope depth . They had bow planes that whipped out automatically from pockets at their sides , and they could dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barracuda , the new Tangs are the deadliest new weapons in the Navy 's underwater arsenal . <P> The trouble is , they are not deadly enough . The Russians have all the U.S. has , and more . With almost no surface fleet ( a few old battleships , a handful of cruisers , no carriers ) , the Russians have concentrated on subs until their underwater fleet is now the world 's largest : 300 operational subs ( against 88 for the U.S. ) ; a goal of 1,000 ocean-going boats . In a war with Russia , the U.S. Navy would be fighting mostly submarines . <P> Silent Service . No one knows better than U.S. submariners themselves how deadly a sub can be . In 1941 , when the proud surface Navy suffered the disaster of Pearl Harbor , a handful of nerveless men had pointed the sharp prows of so-odd U.S. subs toward Japan and written a record of blood and battle unsurpassed in U.S. naval history . Not one of them had ever before fired a torpedo in battle ( U.S. subs engaged mainly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two years they were almost the entire U.S. offensive force in the Pacific . <P> They called themselves " the silent service " and their exploits were inscribed in greasy logbooks and terse messages ( " Sturgeon no longer virgin " ) radioed back to COMSUBPAC headquarters at Pearl Harbor . From their voyages came stories of watching horse races in Tokyo Bay through their periscopes , of torpedoing a new Jap carrier as it slid down the ways , of receiving as many as 400 and 500 depth charges . Subs became the work horses of the fleet : they rescued 504 downed flyers , carried high-priority cargo and VIPs , charted enemy beaches before invasions , staged commando raids , acted as radio and weather stations for the Air Force . Threading their way through plodding Jap convoys , sub skippers set up targets at night on radarscopes . Then they surfaced and steamed through the panicked convoys , shotgunning torpedoes right &; left . <P> By the end of the war , the U.S. had 169 submarines operating in the Pacific . Fifty-two had been lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the " silent service " had sent 6,000,000 tons ( one battleship , seven carriers , 16 cruisers , 45 destroyers , 23 enemy subs , 1,322 other ships ) of Japanese shipping to the bottom . Not even the much-publicized carrier task forces could match their record .
