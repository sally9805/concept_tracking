txt An Army study has concluded that ' nuclear weapons require more , and not less , manpower . The study , based on a variety of reports , including those of combat exercises in the United States and overseas , was completed last May . It was made available today . Army leaders are fighting hard to stave off a cut in strength , from 900,000 to 370 , - 000 , scheduled to be completed by June 30 next year . At a meeting last week of the Association of the United States Army , uniformed leaders , as well as supporters , of the service appealed for a 1,000,000-man force . Gen , Nathan F , Twining , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told the group that none of the services could hope for a personnel increase , and that the Army must work out its plans accordingly , Brucker Is Determined But Wilber M. Brucker , Secretary-of the Army , replied the next night with a declaration of ' his determination to carry on the struggle for more troops . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be related to the views expressed by Neil H. , Secretary of Defense . He used the phrase " increased firepower per unit of manpower , " as he discussed cuts last year . Much of the Army study is still classified , but an unclassified summary of its findings described it as refuting the belief that with modern weapons less manpower was needed . The belief was described as " illogical , " and the new weapons were said to be not a substitute for manpower , but a means of increasing the effectiveness of available troops . The summary declared ; " A decision to reduce man // power because of the greater firepower is fatuous because it fails to take into consideration the opponent who does not follow the same reasoning and who may not reduce manpower . " The result in battle is that there is an imbalance in favor of the opponent . It should be noted that the Soviet Union has not made significant reductions in the size of its ground forces , and has been keeping pace or exceeding our technological advances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army ground forces number at least 2,500,000 . The Army 's arguments in support of its appeal for increased manpower ran as follows : Forward military forces and the strategic army " must be prepared to fight either an atomic or non-atomic war . " Therefore , these forces " must be equipped with both atomic and conventional weapons . " With new weapons , the battle zone is increased in depth . In addition to an integration of nuclear and conventional firepower , " there is a compelling necessity for greater battlefield dispersal to avoid casualties . " While the number of troops put in a given battle area is reduced  --  the report says that the " density of population in the combat zone must be decreased with the threat of. , atomic weapons " ? the total number of troops " is not correspondingly decreased " because the battle zone itself has become substantially greater . The factor of increased reconnaissance and surveillance activities must be considered . With nuclear weapons , " the problem of target acquisition becomes more important , and more difficult . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuclear weapons , their I great destructiveness and their potential hazard to United States forces " demand special care in selection of targets . " In addition , the range of the nuclear missiles far exceeds the range of conventional artillery . Therefore , " our forward deployed forces require additional units equipped to perform air and ground surveillance . " There is also a question of increased logistical support . There would be " an increase in maintenance and supply personnel because support maintenance is required for both atomic and conventional weapons systems . " Another point is that the smaller and more widely dispersed units and installations require increased transportation and other logistical support . The new weapons bring with them an increased training requirement . " Highly trained personnel are required for the operation and maintenance of new missiles systems and other equipment . Not . only is there a , substantial increase . the number of highly trained personnel required but also a substalitial increase in the length of the training courses . " The result is " a large overall increase " in instructors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement factor . With atomic weapons , " there is an anticipated increase in casualties  --  and a greater number of ? replacements in the pipeline . "
