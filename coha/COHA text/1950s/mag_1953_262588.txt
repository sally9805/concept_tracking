The Star ( Bert Friedlob ; 20th Century-Fox ) is a fading movie queen ( Bette Davis ) who is down to her last few dollars and her last several thousand tantrums . Washed up , and with only an old Oscar to keep her company , she tries unsuccessfully to make a movie comeback . The fadeout finds her happy in the realization that , although she is through as an actress , she has a great career ahead of her as a woman with an honest , simple boat mechanic ( Sterling Hayden ) who has loved her all along . Joyously , at the fadeout , she speeds to her man in her Cadillac . <P> With many scenes shot in and around Hollywood , The Star offers some authentic behind-the-scenes glimpses of movietown activities . Its view of its subject , however , is a rather rosily romantic one , complete with a Hollywood happy ending . Nor is the star always the grandly tragic figure she is supposed to be . But if the scripters have not made the most of their theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her performance as an ex-first lady of the screen is first-rate . She is , by turns , mad and loving , nasty and nice , happy and unhappy . She appears in chic clothes and drab ones , is sad at a gay Hollywood party , watches herself on the screen , is jailed for drunken driving , works as a saleslady in a department store . It is a marathon one-woman show and , all in all , proof that Bette Davis - with her strident voice , nervous stride , mobile hands and popping eyes - is still her own best imitator . <P> The Mississippi Gambler ( Universal-International ) . As he cruises along the Mississippi on a pre-Civil War gambling boat , Tyrone Power , a dashing but honest adventurer , has all sorts of remarkable experiences . He encounters a ravishing redhead ( Piper Laurie ) , whom he affectionately calls " pepper pot , " but she declines to have anything to do with him because her weakling brother ( John Baer ) lost an old family heirloom to him during a game of chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hopelessly smitten with brunette Julia Adams , who , in turn , is infatuated with Power . <P> Mississippi Gambler has plenty of feudin ' and fightin ' with pistols , swords and fists . The men are brave and handsome , and the women good and beautiful . Evil is punished and right rewarded . With a rambling the script and lackadaisical direction , the picture , like Ol ' Man River , just keeps rolling along to its predictable Technicolored happy ending .
