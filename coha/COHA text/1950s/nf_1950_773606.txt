txt 300 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 Only a sweet and virtuous soul , Like seasoned timber , never gives ; But though the whole world turn to coal , Then chiefly lives . Henry Vaughan ( 1622-95 ) has been known to readers of English literature for a very few things . His poem The Retreat ' influenced Wordsworth in the composition of his Ode on the Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood , ' and The World ' appears in most anthologies of English poetry : I saw eternity the other night Like a great ring of pure and endless light , All calm as it was bright ; And round beneath it , time , in hours , days , years , Driven by the spheres , Like a vast shadow moved , in which the world And all her train were hurled . The doting lover in his quaintest strain Did there complain ; Near him , his lute , his fancy , and his flights , Wit 's sour delights , With gloves and knots , the silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered lay , while he his eyes did pour Upon a flower . Not less well known is the beautiful elegy , They are all gone into the world of light . ' There is much that is both interesting and significant in the work of the Welsh physician . It is obvious that he was a follower of both Donne and Herbert and also that his mysticism is in larger part social . He had the love of music , the insight into nature , and the sympathy with men that often appear among the Welsh . He was born near the pleasant town of Brecon in the heart of South Wales and was educated at Jesus College , Oxford ; then went up to London intending to study law , but abandoned it for medicine . By about 1647 he was settled as a physician at Newton by Usk . Vaughan , not without effort , achieved musical beauty in his verse and is known as a master in the choice of epithet . After finishing Olor Iscanus ( publ. 1651 ) in 1647 , there was some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illness and bereavement , and he turned strongly to religion . Characteristically he found God in nature and not in the church , although he speaks of the blessed man , Mr. George Herbert , whose holy life and verse gained many pious converts , of whom I am the least . ' Herbert 's influence appears in Silex Scintillans , in two parts ( 165o and 1655 ) . The beautiful poem beginning I walked the other day , to spend my hour , Into a field , Where I sometimes had seen the soil to yield A gallant flower . // is not unlike Herbert ; not less so The Waterfall , ' Cock-crowing , ' and The Night , ' although of course they show Vaughan 's special feeling for nature . Richard Crashaw ( 1612 ? - 49 ? ) , a poet of Catholicism , differs in his religious bent from Herbert and Vaughan . Crashaw 's attitude toward religion is one not of quiet contemplation and evangelical earnestness but of ecstatic worship . He came of Puritan stock , the son of William Crashaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , Cambridge ; later he was fellow of Peterhouse . There he is known to have read the early Church Fathers and the lives of the saints and to have participated in the fasts and vigils of Little Gidding . During the Rebellion Crashaw took refuge in France and was befriended while in great want by Abraham Cowley in Paris . Through the patronage of the exiled Queen Henrietta Maria , whose secretary Cowley was , Crashaw went to Italy as secretary to Cardinal Palotta , who subsequently secured for him a minor post in the Church of Our Lady of Loretto . Shortly after that he died . Steps to the Temple had been published in 1646 . This volume reveals in Crashaw a strain of Italian and Spanish mysticism . He is the most foreign of the poets of his age . He is also spoken of as an uneven poet , but The Flaming Heart ' and A Hymn to the Name and Honour of the Admirable Saint Teresa ' are poems of intense passion and great beauty . Thomas Traherne ( 1634 ? - 1704 ) completes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Herbert . Traherne is a recent discovery . His poems were printed from a manuscript written in 1674 and published in 1903 . The manuscript had been found in a second-hand bookshop in 1897 . Grosart thought the poems were by Vaughan , whose style they resembled , but Bertram Dobell , the bookseller , identified them as the work of Traherne . Further works , Centuries of Meditations , were published in 1908 . Traherne was a man of Welsh descent , son of a shoemaker at Hereford , but happily reared and subject to an extended Oxford education ? B.A. 1656 , M.A. 1661 , B.D. 1669 . He was rector of Chedenhill , near Hereford , from 1657 to 1667 and was chaplain to Sir Orlando Bridgman from the latter date until his death . As a poetic artist Traherne is not always a great success and yet has won admiration for such poems as The Wonder . ' This poem depicts a child 's wonder at the body in which his soul dwells and at the world into which he has been born . Like Vaughan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lost joy . He arrives at a Wordsworthian solution that restoration to the divine spirit might come through love of nature , man , and God . ' 6 . HERRICK Robert Herrick was born of a well-to-do family in Cheapside , London , in 1591 . His father dying when he was a year old , his mother moved to the village of Hampton , and there on the Thames near Hampton Court Herrick grew up . In 1607 he was apprenticed to his uncle , a wealthy goldsmith ; but after some six years , being then twenty-two years old , he left the goldsmith 's trade and . 302 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 entered St. John 's College , Cambridge . Herrick received his B.A. degree in 1617 and M.A. in 162o . He may not , however , have remained in residence after he took his first degree . Indeed , we do not know what he did for ten years until in 1627 he emerged , already in holy orders , as chaplain in the Duke of Buckingham 's unsuccessful military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronology of whose works is a great puzzle , must have written a good deal of poetry during the unknown period , and may have written some of it while he was at Cambridge . It was characteristic of him to save every scrap that he wrote . The certainty with reference to the unknown period is that he was , as they said , sealed of the Tribe of Ben . ' He became Jonson 's greatest disciple and actually realized a greatness in the field of the classical lyric superior to that of Jonson himself . It is a mistake to think that there was any diminution of ancient influence in the early seventeenth century . Quite the contrary , the classics had never been so dominant as they were then . There were mainly two forms of revolt against decadent Petrarchism . One , the more famous one , led by Donne , was a revolution in attitude and style . Of this , so strong in Herbert , there is not a trace in Herrick . The other was the promulgation and practice , by Jonson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the spirited , objective , perfectly ordered poetry of the Latin poets into his very soul . He became an habitual poet , with Horace , Catullus , Ovid , Martial , the Greek poet Anacreon , ' and others as his daily inspiration and his guides . All through Herrick 's poems run the themes , the tastes , the moral attitudes , and the literary purity and precision of his models . This is not to say that Herrick did not live his own life and write constantly about it , but that , more perhaps than any modern poet , he wrote as a Latin poet might have written had he lived in Herrick 's time . He seems , for example , to have paid little attention to his great Elizabethan predecessors . There are casual connections with the songbooks , such as that between Cherry Ripe ' and Campion 's There is a garden in her face ' ; but references to other English poets are relatively few . In adopting the doctrines and practice of Janson , Herrick accepted the common-sense attitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rhyme . Within this limitation Herrick became the master of lyrical measures exquisitely adapted to the purpose in hand . In 1629 Herrick was preferred to the living of Dean Prior , a country parish in Devonshire . He remained there as vicar until he was ousted by the Puritans in 1648 and , after fourteen years of exile , returned to Dean Prior for a period of twelve years before his death in 1674 , the year of Milton 's death . Herrick had , so far as we know , been a city man before he went to Devonshire and had lived in a society of convivial poets , wealthy relatives , and kindly patrons . He was reluctant to go to Devonshire and was bored and disgusted with Dean Prior when he got there . He had written some very good verses called His Farewell to Poetry ' before he went . It looks as if his going to Dean Prior was anything but a farewell to poetry . Much of Herrick 's most beautiful and most characteristic verse must have been written there . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new life and treated it poetically and classically . He felt a similarity between his situation at Dean Prior and that of Horace on his Sabine farm . Very often , when he regarded the shortcomings of his parishioners , he felt that the terse and indelicate epigrams of Martial were the only proper forms in which to castigate them . Herrick saw that country life , the love instinct , rural superstitions , youth , flowers , servants , and pets were much the same in his own day as in the time of the emperor Augustus . There was little necessity for a change in subjects . Wine , women , and song were still at hand . The theme of carpe. diem was still fresh , and a gentle hedonism was as natural to Herrick as to his Romans . Witness his light pathos over death , as in Divination by a Daffodil ' : When a daffodil I see , Hanging down his head towards me , Guess I may what I must be : First , I shall decline my head ; Secondly , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Robin Redbreast , ' or even His Winding-sheet ' and His last Request to Julia . ' Herrick had a quite modern fondness for self-revelation , which rounds him out and makes of him a universal genius in lyricism . He had , besides , his own special interests . He loved nature , particularly flowers , and devoted himself not to landscape but to details . Any sort of mystic rite fascinated him ? games , charms , festivals , and ceremonials . Marriage , because of its ritualistic features , was a genuinely poetical subject to him . He was especially fond of the fairy-lore of rustic superstition , and his fairy poems reveal the nimbleness of his fancy ; as , for example , The Hag ' : The hag is astride This night for a ride , The devil and she together ; Through thick and through thin Now out and then in , Though ne'er so foul be the weather . Some of Herrick 's poems circulated long in manuscript , and a few of them had been printed . He was as sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apparently included everything he had written in the remarkable volume , Hesperides : or the Works , both Humane and Divine of Robert Herrick , Esq. , which was published in 1648 . It contains about twelve hundred secular poems and has appended to it a smaller group of religious poems called Noble Numbers . These have a separate title page dated 1647 . Most of Herrick 's poems are very short ? epigrams , epitaphs , charms , and odd bits ? but there are poems of a hundred lines or more in length . In the volume are some of the greatest lyrics in the English language . ' Herrick does not belong with Waller 304 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 and Cowley , but is , as surely as Milton , a belated product of the Renaissance . This old-fashioned quality may account for the fact that Hesperides was not published again for 150 years . Herrick was so habitually and naturally a poet that one wonders if the habit of poetical composition could have been broken by the publication of his works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come down to us , and , if he continued to write , the work has been lost . 7 . CAREW , SUCKLING , LOVELACE There was much courtliness in the poetry of the Elizabethan age , in the poetry of Sidney , Spenser , Dyer , Drayton , Daniel , Campion , and the sonnet writers . The courtly strain does not die down , but sounds with weaker note , throughout the seventeenth century , when gallantry tends to take the place of true chivalry . Three poets in the reign of Charles I are eminent as courtly poets . The eldest of these , Thomas Carew ( 1598 ? - 1639 ? ) , died just before the storm of the Puritan rebellion scattered the gay circle at Whitehall . Poverty , exile , and death were impending for the poets as well as for the other courtiers . Dances , plays , masques , gay flirtations , and courtly scandals in the royal palace and in the grand homes of the nobility were facing a long adjournment . Carew is so typical that he has almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jonson , but , like others of his kind , had met and enjoyed some of the surprises and shocks that were furnished to the poetic world by Donne . 4n Elegy on the Dean of St. Paul 's , Dr. John Donne shows Carew 's consciousness of poetical issues . Carew himself was a classicist in his formal workmanship , but was also an amatory poet and something of a Petrarchist . He specialized in persuasions to love ' ; but his quiet , masterly skill gives an impression of seriousness to which he is not entitled . Thomas Carew was the son of Sir Thomas Carew , whom he vexed much by the wildness of his youth ? years at Oxford without a degree , more idle years in the Middle Temple , and discharged from his first position as secretary to Sir Dudley Carleton because he circulated scandals about Carleton and his wife . Carew nevertheless subsequently won the favor of King Charles I , held offices in the court , and received an estate from the king . He was popular in the court and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of the day , including the musician , Henry Lawes , who set many of Carew 's lyrics to music . Upon a Ribbon Tied about His Arm by a Lady ' is a charming lyric in long lines . Ask me no more where Jove bestows , when June is past , the fading rose ' is a famous song , and Give me more love or less disdain ' and He that loves a rosy cheek ' scarcely less so . Sir John Suckling ( 1609-42 ) , scion of an old Norfolk family and the inheritor of large estates , was educated at Trinity College , Cambridge , traveled in France and Italy , fought under Gustavus Adolphus , and is said to have been present at // the defeat of Tilly at Breitenfeld ( 1630 . He returned to England in 1632 , lived in sumptuous style , as poet , dramatist , and man of fashion . He was leader of the king 's cause in the early troubles , fled to Paris , and is said by Aubrey to have committed suicide there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says of him , Sir John Suckling typifies the Cavaliers , their loyalty , dash , petulancy , frivolity , easy morals and wit . Rich , spendthrift , valiant , a gamester and a gallant , an amateur of the drama who wrote four not unsuccessful plays and a faithful admirer of Shakespeare , Suckling mocked at the pains Carew took to polish his verses . He was himself an improviser , one whose work is very unequal but who writes with irresistible swing . This is probably not a true conception of Suckling as a poet , but is a reflection of his reputation . His verses show no evidence of carelessness , and his dramas are rather carefully wrought . On the personal side also the estimate is a little misleading , since Suckling was a man who respected religion and wrote a treatise on the subject . He was also a political thinker of ability . His best-known poem is the song from Aglaura , Why so pale and wan , fond lover ? ' which reflects Donne 's mood , as does , Out upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Richard Lovelace ( 1618-58 ) , always associated with Suckling , is noted for a finer chivalry than Suckling manifested . The world has judged him by the two great lyrics , To Althea , from Prison ' and To Lucasta on Going to the Wars . ' The latter contains the famous quatrain , Yet this inconstancy is such As you too shall adore ; I could not love thee , dear , so much , Loved I not honor more . Lovelace wrote other pretty lyrics . He was not so skillful and sustained as Carew , perhaps not so forceful-as Suckling , but has the greatness of having achieved a few immortal utterances . Lovelace was a brilliantly educated man , who attended the Charterhouse School in London and Gloucester Hall , Oxford . Like Suckling he was rich and a courtier . He was in the war on the side of the king and suffered for his loyalty in purse and person . He was in prison in 1648 when he prepared for press his volume , Lucasta : Epodes , Odes , Sonnets , Songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pastoral ( 1649 ) . Lovelace is said to have died in want . He was buried in St. Bride 's Church , and from his tomb Samuel Richardson took the name of his villainous fine gentleman in the novel Clarissa . B. PROSE WRITERS I. BACON The voice of Francis Bacon , first Baron Verulam and Viscount St. Alban 's ( 1561-1626 ) , is so oracular and his intellectual stand so elevated above his fellow mortals that one needs to look at him in relation to his age to realize that he was not in his own time a world figure , apart like Aristotle , but an actual ontempnrary , almost to the year , with George Chapman , Thomas Lodge , and King ) antes I. Francis Bacon was the younger son of Sir Nicholas Bacon , Lord 306 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 Keeper of the Great Seal under Queen Elizabeth , and of Ann Cooke , one of the five famous daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke , who like her sisters was educated in Greek , Latin , Italian , and French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , does much to account for his sound understanding of religio-political questions . Indeed , his first essay in the field of practical political writing , his Letter of Advice to Queen Elizabeth , written at the end of the year 1584 , shortly after he became a member of Parliament , gives the wisest advice of the times as regards the governmental handling of Catholics and Nonconformists . In it he offers a new and practical definition of treason , contending that no man who was willing to bear arms in defense of the state should he regarded as a traitor . This advice was rejected , and Bacon began his Cassandra-like role . Bacon entered Trinity College , Cambridge , at the surprising age of twelve years and three months , remained there until June 1575 , and was then admitted as a law student at Gray 's Inn ; but in 1576 he was attached to Sir Amias Paulet 's embassy to France . He remained in France until his father 's death in 1579 , when he returned to England . How he spent his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home he was already so learned in the world 's literature , history , politics , and philosophy that he must have spent his time in study . In England he began at once his long career as an office seeker . That he was a younger son and under the necessity of making his own way in the world accounts in some measure for his restless ambition . By 1580 he had some suit for preferment before the Lord Treasurer , and after twelve years was still unsuccessful . At that time he wrote the famous letter to Lord Treasurer Burghley that explains his program for the exploitation of science . Lastly , I confess that I have as vast contemplative ends as I have moderate civil ends ; for I have taken all knowledge to be my province . Bacon continued at Gray 's Inn and became what was known as an utter barrister in 1582 . In 1584 he became member of Parliament and again in 1586 . These were the days when he was building up his reputation as an orator and statesman . In 1589 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching the Controversies of the Church of England . In it he restates his moderate opinions with special reference to Puritanism . Bacon had his first personal contacts with the Earl of Essex in 1591 . He received much patronage from the queen 's unfortunate and dangerous favorite , so that when he acted as Essex 's most effective prosecutor when Essex was tried and condemned for treason ( 16o I ) , it was urged against Bacon as an act of ingratitude . Bacon was no man to stick to a sinking ship , and yet he proved in his Sir Francis Bacon his Apology , in certain Imputations concerning the Late Earl of Essex ( 1604 ) that he had warned Essex against the danger of the policy he was pursuing and also that he , Bacon , would not follow Essex in any illegal acts . One would like to think that Bacon could not do otherwise than act as Essex 's prosecutor without implicating himself , but over against this lies the idea that Bacon was altogether too eager to secure courtly favor to heed the demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosper under Queen Elizabeth . But under James I his fortune took a turn for the better . I le was knighted in 1603 , given a pension of sixty pounds in 1604 , and in 16u5 was so faru in the // king 's favor that he dedicated in very personal terms his Advancement of Learning to the king . The elaborate compliments to the king in that book constitute the one blemish in an otherwise perfect work . One would prefer to think that Bacon in his self-seeking solicitude had his tongue in his cheek when he wrote the compliments , to believing that this cleverest of modern men mistook the inferior James I for a man of superior greatness . But perhaps the true explanation of these compliments and of a lifelong bias is that Bacon was so infatuated with royalty that he regarded the glamour of kingship as the grace of God and thus had his intellect superseded by his religion . In 1607 Bacon at last received appointment to a public office . He was made Solicitor-General . He now sided with the king as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong side . He was what we should call parliamentary leader of the king 's party after 1612 . In 1613 he received the longcoveted office of Attorney-General . His views were now set , we may believe sincerely , in favor of absolutism . They had not been so during the reign of Queen Elizabeth , and the spectacle is not an attractive one . Bacon prosecuted Oliver St. John for denouncing royal benevolences and consented to the torture of Edmund Peacham , charged with preaching a treasonous sermon ( 1615 ) . His adversary in this case was Sir Edward Coke , the great advocate of English common law , and from that time on these two great legal minds were pitted against each other . Perhaps his very rivalry with Coke intensified Bacon 's advocacy of monarchic rule against common law and the rights of man . Bacon 's cause was doomed , but the power of his advocacy should not be overlooked . In a very brilliant effort he prosecuted the fallen favorite , the Earl of Somerset , for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite , George Villiers , Duke of Buckingham . There again we must defend Bacon at the expense of his judgment and his character . The best that can be said is that he attempted the impossible task of making a decent man of Villiers when he became the king 's favorite ( 1616 ) . He wrote A Letter of Advice to the Duke of Buckingham , when he became Favorite to King James . Bacon here justifies the institution of royal favorites on the ground that a king is by his station isolated from human contacts and that favorites are demanded by the human , as distinguished from the divine , side of his nature . The favorite should be a responsible person , because he has the king 's heart in his hand and is the custodian of the king 's good name and of his mercy and justice . Bacon continued to do well in his worldly fortunes . In 1616 he was made Privy Councillor , in 1617 Lord Keeper , and in 1618 Lord Chancellor , the highest legal office in the realm . Meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But trouble was brewing . In 1621 the Commons , exasperated by the exactions of Buckingham , particularly his increase in monopoly patents , assembled , bent on revenge if not on reform . They were in search of a victim , and Bacon had become notorious for his adherence to Buckingham . Failing in their effort to attack the master , they attacked the man . They impeached Bacon before the bar of the House of Lords on the charge that he had taken bribes f rung suitors , a customary thing but against the law . Bacon at first treated the charges with contempt and girded himself for defense . Then , most unexpectedly , he confessed , declared that he had been guilty of corruption and neglect , ' but denied that he had perverted justice , and offered no defense before 308 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 the bar . Why he did this has always been a mystery . Bacon consented to the staining of his name . He could not have defended himself without implicating Buckingham , and it was to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not proceed to that length . Bacon had an interview with the king before he made his confession , and the question again arises whether Bacon was so blinded by his loyalty to the king , so convinced by what he considered the welfare of the state , that he sacrificed himself for the sake of the foolish , corrupt , and degenerate king and his nefarious favorite . He was fined ? ? 0,000 , imprisoned during the king 's pleasure , banished from the court , and , most painful of all , deprived of the right to serve the state in Parliament or elsewhere . If it was a bargain between Bacon and the king , the king carried out his obligations in part at least . He freed Bacon from the Tower and remitted the fine ; but , though Bacon long sought it , the king never restored his civil rights . Probably he was glad enough to have Bacon safely out of the way , for Bacon had a conscience and a lifelong habit of giving good advice , which folly and corruption had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's gain . He devoted the rest of his life to literary and philosophical work . Up until this time he had not published a great deal , although his three finest works had all been done ? the Essays , The Advancement of Learning , and Novum Organism . Essays , Religious Meditations , Places of Persuasion and Dissuasion is a little volume published in 1597 . There are ten essays in the volume , which , he tells his brother Anthony in the prefatory epistle , are designed to come home to men 's business and bosoms . ' The essays in their first form are highly condensed groups of statements whose unity is aphoristic rather than structural . That is , they are like little globes surrounding completely one center . Bacon continually enlarged and revised the collections , which were published again in 1612 and finally in the edition of 1625 . Some of the original ten , such as Of Studies , ' Of Discourse , ' and Of Followers and Friends ' remained almost unchanged in the later versions . The revision of 1612 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds thirty essays , some of which , like Of Friendship , ' Of Wisdom for a Man 's Self , ' Of Youth and Age , " Of Marriage and the Single Life , " Of Great Place , " Of Atheism , " Of Superstition , ' and Of Death , ' are great masterpieces . In the edition of 1625 there are eighteen new essays , including Of Truth , ' Of Revenge , " Of Adversity , ' Of Simulation and Dissimulation , ' and Of Gardens . ' Perhaps the last essays are most profound of all . In his revisions and additions Bacon grew constantly more discursive , more like Montaigne , though never so discursive as Montaigne . He kept throughout his revisions his close condensation of style , so that no paraphrase can he as concise as the original . The greatness of Bacon 's essays is that they are about life , and , as long as civilized life maintains its inevitable interrelations , Bacon 's judgment must command the attention of all men . Unification is a primary tendency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect . Bacon had these two qualities at possibly the highest recorded level ; therefore , when he surveyed the world systematically , his mind arrived at essential things . At that point his superior powers of expression came into play , and we get a result that is truth perfectly attired . The determination of the line between the known and the unknown is a primary step in the advancement of all scholarship and science , so that it was it // stroke of genius on Bacon 's part to begin his work as an investigator with an attempt to carry out that process . He thus gave an indispensable lead to all future workers . The Advancement of Learning is a critique of science and scientists , and Bacon was perhaps greatest as the founder of a school of criticism . He followed The Advancement of Learning ( later rewritten in Latin as De Augmentis Scientiarum ) with an elaborate study of scientific methodology , Novum Organism ( 1620 ) , and constructed , with these two works as parts , a grand outline or encyclopedia of all science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , method of procedure , and finally the materials of science itself . The Instauratio Magna was thus , like a great manufacturing plant , an instrument that was finally to fill the world with its products . He did not , like Gilbert and Harvey , begin as a scientist where science then was , but attempted to work out constructively the whole scheme of what the body of science would be . No one can say that Bacon was not essentially right , for science has not yet reached the point of complete mastery for which Bacon strove . The co-workers that Bacon desired did not appear in his time but later , in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . The work of the Royal Society was inspired by Bacon , and his inspiration and guidance have continued to operate . It is not to belittle him to say , as C. D. Broad does , that he mainly inspired the advancement of science in the modern world , but to pay him the highest compliment and to recognize that he was fundamentally right . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide to scientific research , but he started men on the right road , gave them the will to subdue the material world , and the caution they would need in their campaign . Of the Pro ficience and Advancement of Learning has been called an essay on the intellectual life of England at the opening of the seventeenth century , but it is more than this , since it points the way , like no other work , toward the future . The first book deals with the merits and , still more , the demerits of the learning of the time . There are major distempers consisting of the excessive zeal and the jealousy of the theologians , the arrogancy of politicians , and the poverty , obscurity , and pedantry of the professors of learning ; also their bad manners and , particularly , their bad habits of study . Learning is fantastical , contentious , and dilettante . Besides these major distempers , there are peccant humours ' consisting of stolid worship of the past and the craze for novelty , despair of further advancement , self-conceit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universality in favor of so-called practical matters , excessive rationalism , prejudice against the humanities , impatience with slow progress , dogmatism , personal gain as an end instead of scientific detachment , and misconception of the true ends of knowledge . As Bacon puts it , But the greatest error of all the rest is the mistaking or misplacing of the last or farthest end of knowledge : for men have entered into a desire of learning and knowledge , sometimes upon a natural curiosity and inquisitive appetite ; sometimes to entertain their minds with variety and delight ; sometimes for ornament and reputation ; and sometimes to enable them to a victory of wit and contradiction ; and most times for lucre and profession ; and seldom sincerely to give a true account of their gift of reason , to the benefit and use of men : as if there were sought in knowledge a couch whereupon to rest a searching and restless spirit ; or a terrace for a wandering and variable mind to walk 310 THE LTTERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 up and down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proud mind to raise itself upon ; or a fort or commanding ground for strife and contention ; or a shop for profit and sale ; and not a rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the relief of man 's estate . The second section of the second book of The Advancement of Learning deals with the dignity and value of learning and rises as it proceeds to a height of eloquence and beauty almost unequaled . It is a survey of all the fields of learning in an attempt to determine whether they had been adequately investigated and what yet remained to be done . Bacon classifies the arts and sciences according to the faculties of the human mind . He gives to the understanding ' an important position and divides human philosophy into psychology , dealing with man as an individual , and civil knowledge , dealing with man in society . He first refers the origin and nature of the soul and the question of its immortality to religion and thus rids his field of troublesome intruders , and then declares , The parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's understanding : history to his memory , poesy to his imagination , and philosophy to his reason . ' This classification is still in some sense valid , and has been given some confirmation from the localization of functions within the human brain . A significant revelation of Bacon 's point of view is his division of natural philosophy into natural science , dealing with discovery of causes , and natural prudence , dealing with the production of effects . This shows a wide difference between the attitude of Bacon and that of the Aristotelians . To the latter , nature was a static thing , which could not be manipulated into change . It could only be described and classified ; whereas Bacon proposed to change nature in man 's behalf , to adjust nature to man 's needs , and thus restore man to a position of sovereignty over nature . Almost everything in Bacon 's influence is the result of this revolutionary theory . Novum Organum treats of subject matter in the first book and of the method of science in the second . To Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He believed also in an objectively existent material universe outside of and independent of the perceiving mind . He realized , however , that observation is limited and that there are things going on under the surface that are beyond the reach of the senses . These hidden things , he thought , constitute largely the determining forces , and his purpose was to proceed from the simple data of sense to the discovery of hidden laws . He did not think it possible to reach the very ultimate secret of nature , but he did think it possible to make progress toward that end . He sought to determine a method and to regulate the mind of the investigator . For these two purposes he worked out in Novum Organum an inductive method of procedure and evolved his doctrine of Idols , a masterpiece for the guidance of the scientist . " These Idols , which are presented in aphorisms xxxvi to lxix in the second book , are an illuminating presentation of human error : first , the Idols of the Tribe , covering those errors that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a false mirror , distorts and colors the nature of things . Next come the Idols of the Cave , which are the errors of the individual man , who lives in a cave or den of his own that refracts and discolors , by idiosyncrasy , education , or prejudice , the light of nature . The third kind of idols are the Idols of the Marketplace . These are the errors that arise from the misuse or misunderstanding of words.Finally , there are what PROSE WRITERS : THE AUTHORIZED VERSION OF THE BIBLE 31I Bacon calls the Idols of the Theatre , by which he means the errors arising from various dogmas of philosophers and wrong laws of demonstration . Errors the most widely different have yet causes for the most part alike . ' As to Bacon 's other work , the History of Henry VII ( 1622 ) , written to please fames I , who fancied that he resembled his ancestor , is admired for its grave historical style and for its sagacity in political matters . Bacon seems to have possessed a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Henry VIII and of Queen Elizabeth , which bear this out . His New Atlantis ( 1626 ) is an attempt to present in the form of fiction a Utopia of scholars and scientists at work according to the plans and methods Bacon had laid down in his own writings on the advancement of learning . Solomon 's House ' is a Utopian college after which the scientists of the Restoration may have sought to model their Royal Society . Certainly the exaltation of curiosity , industry , caution , co-operation , and hospitality on the part of the Royal Society are suggestive of Bacon 's picture of the College of the Six Days ' Work . ' 2 . THE AUTHORIZED VERSION OF THE BIBLE Before we go further in tracing main currents , we should describe perhaps the most perfect literary monument of the age , the Authorized Version of the Bible . The Authorized Version was made at a very happy time . The Geneva Bible , which the Authorized Version superseded in general use , was an honest translation with no conscious manifestations of partisanship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship and a more official sanction . The tide of English Puritanism had been severely checked and that of Laudism had not got under way . The translators were for the most part moderate men and still sufficiently religious to see to it that there should not pass away one jot or one tittle from the law . The excellencies of the English Biblical translation were cumulative , and it was the announced policy of the makers of the Authorized Version to accept the best rendering wherever it was to be found . The making of the translation was suggested at the Hampton Court Conference in 1604 and was proposed by Dr. John Reynolds , president of Corpus Christi College , Oxford , himself a man of Low Church , if not Puritan , leanings . Forty-seven of the leading scholars and divines of the day were chosen as translators . They were divided into groups to deal with various sections of the Scriptures , and the enterprise as a whole was well managed . The work occupied three years and a half and was completed and published in 1611 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further influence from the Geneva Bible and the intermediate versions as well as from Wycliffe . The Authorized Version thus gave no shock to readers already familiar with the Bible , was relatively free from partisan bias , and was , therefore , quickly accepted by all denominations . Its literary influence is a commonplace , as is its influence on the English language and on English thought . There are Elizabethan features in the language of the Authorized Version , but it is not exclusively a Renaissance classic . It stood apart from current written discourse then as now . Some features go back to the time of Wycliffe or earlier , some are derived from the Latin Vulgate , and some taken over and naturalized from Hebrew and Greek . 312 THE LI'T'ERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 3 . ESSAYS AND CHARACTERS We have considered the singular force and weight of Bacon 's Essays , both in matter and expression . There were other essays and essay-like writings in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries , although the form was as yet undeveloped and unrecognized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Plutarch , the Epistolae Morales of Seneca , and the Dissertationes of Epictetus . Montaigne had invented the word essay ' to describe his informal and personal treatises , and the name and the thing itself began to appear in Bacon 's time . The anonymous Remedies against Discontentment ( 1596 ) is sometimes regarded as the first publication of English essays . Essays ( 1600 ) by Sir ' William Cornwallis started a considerable flood : Robert Johnson 's Essays or Rather Imperfect Offers ( 16o i ) , the anonymous Essays of Conjecture ( 16o7 ) , David Tuvill 's Essays Politic and Moral ( 16o8 ) . The Horae Subsecivae : Observations and Discourses ( 162o ) of disputed authorship , Owen Felltham 's Resolves ( 1623 ? ) , Donne 's Paradoxes and Problems , and Ben Jonson 's Timber or Discoveries are some of the most important of early essays . The form of the essay showed from the beginning the range it has always had in English , varying from an individualized , intentionally incomplete epistle-like discourse , on the one hand , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most popular and lasting of essay-like forms of the seventeenth century was the character , a literary type modeled and named after the Characteroi of the Greek psychologist Theophrastus . Theophrastus became known in Latin translation in 1592 and in English in 1616 . He wrote short pieces in prose in which he embodied in a human being some moral characteristic , and then described the person 's actions under its influence . For example , when the coward goes to sea he imagines that promontories are pirates ; when he gets on the field of battle , he straightway remembers that he must run hack to his tent for his sword . ' Bishop Joseph Hall 's Characters of Virtues and Vices ( 1608 ) is the first English book of characters . He was followed by Sir Thomas Overbury , whose Characters was published in 1614 , as written by himself and other learned gentlemen his friends . ' The greater number of his eighty portraits are of trades and professions . Overhury was a courtier and an acute and acrimonious observer of men and manners . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profess scorn of the ordinary and the commonplace in human life . Character writing reached perhaps its highest point in the work of John Earle , whose Microcosmography was published in 1628 . Earle was not so well equipped for his task as was Overbury , whose opportunities for seeing the world were better than Earle 's ; but Earle 's portrait of A Pretender to Learning ' and other portraits from the clerical and academic world , in which he was most at home , show that his representations of life are truer than Overbury 's . Samuel Butler ( 1612-8o ) , author of Hudibras , also wrote Characters ( 1759 ) . Undoubtedly Clarendon in ' the great character sketches he drew of the leaders on both sides in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars had had his pen sharpened by the character writers ; and also no doubt Dryden had felt the same influence in his depiction of his enemies in his satires . // Another thread in the weaving of English prose literature may be taken up and traced from James Howell ( 1594-1666 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1650 . The element in them is the spirit of journalism , and nowhere do we find such a journalist before journalism as this conceited little Welshman . The murder of Buckingham is one of the many good stories ' that his taste for news and its dissemination and his eye for detail have preserved for us in his hook of essays . 4 . BURTON Even Bacon had in him a large element of the Middle Ages , and the Schoolmen , whom he denounced , were not without a share in his thought and his method . Other writers on scientific subjects follow the old method of procedure . What we have is an age , actuated by a genuine curiosity and a new scientific interest , which had not yet shaken itself free from a long-established methodology . This is in general true of Burton , Browne , Walton , the theologians , and many others . Robert Burton ( 1577-1640 ) was equally scientific in purpose with Gilbert and Harvey , but Burton has gained the reputation of being an eccentric largely because , although his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , schooled at Nuneaton and Sutton Coldfield , then at Brasenose College , and for forty years a member of Christ Church , Oxford , was one of the most learned men of whom we have any record . He professed medicine and law as well as divinity , and among other minor works in Latin he left a comedy of university life of great humor and interest called Philosophaster . Bacon rejected Aristotle , or rather Aristotelianism , and with it all secular authority and all systems resting on authority alone . Burton , whose interests and motives were not unlike those of Bacon , did not reject authority , but made in The Anatomy of Melancholy ( 1621 ) a vast systematic attempt to arrive at truth by the weighing of all authorities on all sides of the many questions that arose in connection with his theme . Melancholy was an essentially vague subject . By it he meant human sadness from whatever cause , an inbred malady in every one of us . ' With modern people low spirits are a symptom ; with him and the thinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scholastic completeness to describe and discuss the subject . It was inevitable that his work should embrace the whole life of man , including pastimes and pursuits , social and political activities , as well as mental and bodily health . Melancholy gave Burton an unlimited charter and opened a field for the display of his humor , pathos , wit , and wisdom . No book , not even the Summa of St. Thomas Aquinas , is more meticulously outlined . Part 1 gives us definitions , causes , symptoms , and the nature of melancholy ; part n deals with cures ; and part III offers special studies of the melancholy of religion and that of love . Burton 's method entailed upon him endless citation , for he hoped by citing all authorities with their differences and their agreements to discover the truth . He took a scholar 's pride in the exactitude and range of his references . He is not devoid of criticism , does not merely split differences or decide according to numbers ; and , when he goes wrong , his error is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement of his hard task he evolved a closely packed elliptical style , which his mod314 // ern critics call quaint . ' It was not meant to he quaint , but was meant to be and is a model of condensation . The gravity with which Burton tackles what are to us sometimes scientific absurdities or mere superstitions often misleads his readers into thinking him intentionally humorous when he is gravely serious . 5 . RALEGH Sir Walter Ralegh ( 1552 ? - 1618 ) was not so much a systematic philosopher as a man typical of the Renaissance in his life ? opinions , grasp , quickness , versatility , courage , and energy . His thought was within the bounds of the old system . While he was in prison in the Tower , Prince Henry sympathized with him and visited him . Ralegh sat down to write The History of the World ( 1614 ) for Prince Henry . He finished only one large folio volume , which covers the history of the Jews , the Egyptians , the Greeks and their mythology , and Rome and Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show God 's judgment on the wicked , and many things seemed to him appropriately treated that would not seem so to any modern writer . He explains his belief in astrology and in man as a microcosm , because he thought that the history of the world or macrocosm is a revelation of the history of the individual man . There are passages of noble eloquence in the History and a consistency in viewing the world that is of the same sort as that of Sidney , Hooker , and Shakespeare . 6 . SIR THOMAS BROWNE Ralegh was almost untouched by the new movements of thought , whereas Sir Thomas Browne ( I605-82 ) , learned physician , antiquarian , scientist , and stylist , is typical of the new century in his writings and his life . Browne suffers from the reputation of being the writer of possibly the most beautiful English prose that has been written , and of being that only . One often encounters the ignorant critical error that he used his observations of life merely as an occasion for sonorous prose . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forefront of scientific investigation , thought of himself as a scientist , was , after Bacon , the greatest apologist of science , and devoted his best energies to the discovery of truth . That he ( lid not succeed in getting rid of all errors in the realm of popular belief is not to be wondered at ; but it is strange that the open-minded man who produced Pseudodoxia Epidemica , or Enquiries into Very Many Received Tenets and Commonly Presumed Truths , which examined prove but Vulgar and Common Errors ( 1646 ) , should he described as credulous and prized merely for his eloquence . Browne was a follower of Bacon and as carefully determined to accept as true only that which was capable of demonstration as was Bacon himself . Browne needs to be brought to life as a man and a thinker . No man 's prose style can be divorced from his thought , since all prose writing is a matter of ideas or nothing . Sir Thomas Browne was horn on 19 October 1695 , in the parish of St. Michael , Cheapside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same neighborhood . He belonged to a well-to-do family ; and seems never to have been in need of money . Ile attended the famous secondary school Winchester College , // and later Broadgates Hall , Oxford , which during his student days became Pembroke College . To complete his education in medicine Browne traveled on the Continent , attended lectures at Montpellier in France , Padua in Italy , and Leyden in Holland , at which last-mentioned place he was made doctor of medicine at some unrecorded date about 1633 . Each of these European universities was famous in medicine ? Montpellier for drugs , Padua for surgery , and Leyden for the new chemical medicine . Browne settled on his return to England at Shipden Hall near Halifax in Yorkshire , and there practiced medicine until 1637 , when he moved to the city of Norwich . He is always thought of in connection with Norwich . He was resident at Shipden Hall when he wrote Religio Medici , about 1635 or 1636 . After the fashion of the time the hook apparently circulated in manuscript , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not immediately published . A had version came out in 1642 , so had that Browne found it desirable to issue the next year an authorized edition . No book of such latitudinarian doctrine , claiming at the same time Christian orthodoxy , had as yet appeared in English . On the basis of this book it was surmised that the author was at heart a Catholic and also a Quaker , although it is obvious he could not have been both and he had declared himself an adherent of the Established Church of England . Such a view as Browne gave of the breadth of the mercy of God was to many thinkers of the day an impossible heresy . This tolerance in the days of intolerance is worth inquiring into , arid it turns out that Browne 's attitude toward religion arises from his attitude toward science . He had a mind at once scientific and reverent and found no incompatibility between science and religion . He stood strongly for the dictum that , in science , experience and not authority is supreme . He betrays his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he often does , Solomon 's desire for wisdom . The advantage I have of the vulgar , ' he says , with the content and happiness I conceive therein , is ample recompense for all my endeavours , in what part of knowledge soever . Wisdom is his most beautiful attribute ; no man can attain unto it ; yet Solomon pleased God when he desired it . ' It is small homage , he thinks , to God ignorantly to admire his works : The wisdom of God receives small honour from those vulgar heads that stare about and with a gross rusticity admire his works . ' After the publication of Vulgar Errors , which was regarded in its day as a work of exact and careful scientific method , and , particularly , after the appearance of Urn-Burial ( 1658 ) , also regarded not only as a work of sound learning hut of sound procedure , Browne became famous as an authority on science and was consulted widely on matters of antiquarianism and natural history . He busied himself for many years in scientific work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact a sort of director of research . I make not my head a grave , ' he says ; and also , It is an honourable object to see the reasons of other men wear our liveries , and their borrowed understandings do homage to the bounty of ours . ' Browne corresponded with the most important scientific workers itt many fields . His tract Of Garlands , and possibly his Observations on Grafting , were done at the request of John Evelyn . The paper on Iceland is based on his conversations and correspondence with the antiquarian and historian Arngrim 316 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1435-166o . Jonas . In 1671 King Charles II visited Norwich and conferred on Browne , as a distinguished citizen , the honor of knighthood . ' As to the much discussed question of Browne 's style , one may agree that he is one of the most exquisite writers of English prose in the whole range of our literature , and add that he is such for certain reasons not always taken into consideration . His charm is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , to his deep and stately periods , drawn out and amplified like organ music , and to the freedom and brilliance with which his imagination plays over the surface of his thought . To these rococo traits one should also add this , that his style is a garment for his thought , a garment sometimes plain and severe and sometimes gorgeous . In its variations it expresses the astonishing variety of Browne 's mind . His syntax , his way of keeping his coherence , even in passages of mystical beauty , bears this out . This order in the midst of exuberance is , after all , exactly what should he expected of a man imbued , as Browne was , with the melancholy and mysticism of a deeply religious age , yet at the same time leading a new age of scientific investigation . 7 . SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY PREACHERS The religious interests of seventeenth-century poets appear also in the prose of preachers and writers on religious subjects . At the head of the list of seventeenth-century divines should stand the name of Lancelot Andrewes , although a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . He was a famous preacher , and his sermons were issued by ones and twos throughout his career , for his fame never lapsed . More obviously a rhetorician than the later preachers , he made a greater use than they of his learning in his sermons , but his sincerity and his sound religious thinking arc still obvious . John Donne 's career as a preacher began in his forty-second year , but he reached an eminence second to none . His sermons are extremly difficult , and we may well believe that he was a preacher to learned audiences , but there is no doubt that he had also a popular appeal . His sermons offer the chief claim to Donne 's greatness as a prose writer and are the bases of all criticisms of his very difficult style . The original publications are LXXX Sermons ( 1640 ) , Fifty Sermons ( 1649 ) , and XXVI Sermons ( 166o ) . In all , 160 sermons , some very long , are preserved . One asks how the audiences of the day could not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be written off : Donne is known to have been a great orator , great in delivery . The spirit of the age , an intense and permeating interest in religion , was with him . His preachings were great occasions , with all that ceremony and solemnity could do to quiet and unify his audience , and , at the same time that it was quieted and attuned , to intensify its ability to comprehend . The subject matter of the sermons was great and important . Men do not change their passions , ' says Donne , hut only the objects . // of them : God does not take men from their calling , but mends them in it ; He loves renovations , but not innovations . ' Donne preached about familiar subjects ? good and evil , desire and disillusion , life and death . He also achieved the mood of religion ? the reaching out of the soul after God . These were and are great subjects when treated in an inevitable human mood . We must also remember that Donne 's religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Christian theology . We must also add an element from style , the style that prevailed in the prose of the age . There was as yet no great demand for an orderly arrangement of the parts of sentences , with co-ordination and subordination of clauses within the sentences . Donne goes on and on , expecting and getting attention to the thought or image of immediate utterance , and lets structural logic take care of itself . Even today this principle has to be obeyed in reading Donne 's sermons . Finally , we must perhaps attribute something to the mentality of the audience . These were the same people who were able to follow the compact dramatic style of the later Shakespeare and of Ben Jonson and Middleton . It must have been an age of superior general intelligence . Popular education , in which there had been some advancement , does not account for everything , and we are tempted to believe that the intellectual level was high and that the Elizabethans as a group had superior ability to comprehend what was said . Jeremy Taylor ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divines , ' was born at Cambridge and educated at Gonville and Caius College . His father was a barber or barber surgeon , and Taylor had nothing with which to make his way in a none too hospitable world but goodness , good sense , personal charm , and intellectual ability . It is an open secret that Taylor was a poet who wrote prose . He has also been called the Shakespeare of divines ' and has often , because of his vigorous and florid imagination , been compared to Spenser . After he took his M.A. at Cambridge , Taylor delivered a series of eloquent lectures at St. Paul 's Cathedral and thus attracted the attention of Archbishop Laud . " Through Laud 's influence he was sent to Oxford , where he was fellow of All Souls for two years , and then in 1638 became rector of Uppington in Rutlandshire . He then became chaplain to Archbishop Laud and also to King Charles I , whose cause against the Parliament he espoused , becoming a chaplain in the king 's army . He was captured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was released , and then retired to Golden Grove , Carmarthenshire . There he opened a school and for a longtime enjoyed comparative peace and leisure for literary work . Almost all of Taylor 's writings are distinguished . The year 1647 gave us The Liberty of Prophesying , by which Taylor meant preaching . It is the first work on toleration issued from the party of the establishment and one of the earliest works on religious toleration in Christendom . Taylor 's only positive requirement was profession of belief in the Apostles ' Creed . The simple splendor of his style appears now and then in this work on toleration , but it appears steadily and evenly in Taylor 's most famous works , Holy Living and Holy Dying ( 1650-51 ) . A famous series of sermons for the Christian year , Eniautos , appeared in 1653 , and a very attractive work called The Worthy Communicant in 1660 . In 1658 ' Naylor went to Ireland under the patronage of the Earl of Conway and spent moat of the rest of his life in that country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come down in religious history as the ideal priest , in gentleness , charity , good sense , broad learning , and personal charm , being perfect in the fact that the trials of his life made him more and more fit to live , more gentle , tolerant , and loving . A speculative liberal in theology , he concerned himself not with doctrine , but with the inevitable questions of life and death , spiritual fitness , and moral character . As a preacher , he was luminous . He let his imagination play over the world in which he lived , over aspects of life and aspects of nature . His sermon The Marriage Ring ' is comparable to Milton 's great poem on wedded love , The Return of Prayers ' contains the famous description of the flight of the skylark , and his First Sermon for Advent Sunday has his gorgeously imaginative description of the Day of Judgment . Richard Baxter ( 1615-91 ) , though very different from Jeremy Taylor , was also a great preacher and a great man . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king and became also a chaplain in the army . He did not attend a university , but became nevertheless a broadly learned man . In 1638 he was ordained and became master of a school at Dudley , but his life as a clergyman began when he accepted the curacy of Kidderminster , a place notorious for godlessness , and made it a model parish . He led always a busy and useful life , although subjected to many vicissitudes . He helped with the return of Charles II , and after the Restoration was offered a bishopric , but his conscience would not permit him to accept conformity . He was accordingly ousted from Kidderminster in 1662 and went to London , where his activities as preacher and writer made him a target for abuse and a victim of repeated persecutions , being imprisoned for a period of two years as late as 1685-6 . He lived to see the Revolution of 1688 . All his life Baxter poured out writings , volume after volume and pamphlet after pamphlet , without much care or conscious art ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true record of Baxter himself . Of his many works almost everything is forgotten except The Saints ' Everlasting Rest ( 165o ) , the Call to the Unconverted ( 1657 ) , and his long autobiography , Reliquiae Baxterianae ( 1696 ) . The former two are books of evangelical religion , which , although now neglected , entered deeply into the religious life of both England and America . The Reliquiae Baxterianae is a historical document of great value and from a literary point of view a frank and picturesque record of much interest . Coleridge , who like Dr. Johnson was an admirer of Baxter , said of it , I may not infrequently doubt Baxter 's memory , or even his competence , in consequence of his particular modes of thinking ; but I could almost as soon doubt the gospel verity as his veracity . ' It may be a step down to join with these divines , Taylor and Baxter , the Puritan pamphleteer William Prynne ( 1600-1669 ) . Perhaps Prynne does not belong to English literature at all , and yet he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time . ' His story at least belongs to the age . // Prynne was educated at Bath grammar school , Oriel College , Oxford , and Lincoln 's Inn , of which he was a barrister . A man of violent extremes , he was entrapped by his own violence . He entered the field of controversy as an opponent of Arminianism , then the fashionable doctrine of the Church and the Court , and passed from that into the ungrateful position of general reformer of morals . Of his two hundred books and pamphlets all are forgotten except the one that was his fate . In 1633 he wrote his famous attack on the immorality of the stage , Histriomastix . Prynne was accused of slandering in this work both the king and the queen , and was arraigned before the Star Chamber . His sentence was one of the most notoriously cruel on record . After a year in prison he came to trial and was sentenced to have his hook burned by the hangman , to pay a fine of ? 5,000 , to be expelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ears shorn in the pillory , and to suffer imprisonment for life . While in prison he wrote more pamphlets assailing Laud and the bishops and was again fined 15,000 , put in the pillory , sentenced to have more shorn from his ears and to be branded on both cheeks . He was released from prison by the Long Parliament in 1640 , only to proceed in his career of controversialist general . It is on record that he was Laud 's prosecutor . There is something courageous about his pertinacity . He favored the restoration of Charles II , was thanked by the king , became a member of Parliament and , ironically enough , keeper of records in the Tower , where he ( lid some valuable service as a compiler of constitutional documents . No more violent contrast could be found than that between the cantankerous and pertinacious Prynne and the easy-going , witty , and humorous Thomas Fuller ( 16o8-61 ) . Fuller has a secure place in literature , not only because he was admired by Coleridge and Lamb , but because at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hole State and the Profane State ( 1642 ) is a series of witty and vivid characters and essays . Good Thoughts in Bad Times ( 1645 ) is a book of meditations , many on his own errors and shortcomings ; also brief lessons from the Scriptures , significant historical events , and anecdotes , humorous , whimsical , and wise . The Worthies of England ( 1662 ) is a strange and charming medley about England ? its counties , towns , and regions , its popular antiquities , and the lives of its great men . Fuller 's biographies are not very reliable perhaps , but give us touches of life we could ill dispense with . It is he who tells us about the witcombats between Ben Jonson and Shakespeare , whom he compares to a Spanish great galleon ' and an English man of war . ' Master Jonson ( like the former ) was built far higher in learning , solid but slow in performances .

' Fuller could have lived happily and successfully in any age , as he showed by living thus through a very trying one . It should also be stated that he wrote several long histories , The Holy War ( 1639 ) dealing with crusades , Church History of Britain ( 1655 ) , and History of Cambridge University ( 1655 ) . 8 . WALTON AND EVELYN Two prose writers remain to be mentioned . Both lived on into the period of the Restoration , and both did part of their work in that time , but both belong essentially to the earlier rather than the latter half of the sixteenth century ? Izaak Walton and John Evelyn . Walton ( 1593-1683 ) was a London ironmonger who retired from business during the civil war . He was loyal to the Church and Crown and later author of a series of short lives mainly of churchmen . His biographies of Donne , Henry Wotton , Hooker , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1640 and 1678 , are masterpieces , not of biography , but of style and temper , hearty sincerity , cheerfulness and good nature , and personal interest in the men treated . His mistakes as a biographer , for example in. the case of Hooker , have to be guarded against , but his pictures are essentially true . There was one thing , however , that Walton loved better than he did clergymen and bishops , and that was fishing . He had spent his holidays from the shop in fishing , particularly angling , and had become a master fisherman . He had studied , practiced , listened to fishermen 's talk , and acquired the skill of rod and line . He accordingly proceeded to write a treatise on angling . It was a serious purpose with him and with his age , and for a long time before his day there had appeared such treatises on sports ? Ascham 's Toxophilus , Grison 's treatises on horsemanship , Turbervile 's treatise on hunting , and so on . In other words , Walton did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise or perhaps expect that it would last beyond its utility as a practical manual , but he so imbued it with the poetry of the subject that it became one of the world 's famous books . Moreover , it retains something of its original quality and any fisherman will recognize that The Compleat Angler is perfect both in the strategy and the tactics of the art of fishing with rod and line . Its charm rests also on its background , which is made up of natural scenery , life at inns , fishermen 's tales and casual conversations with fishermen , and of casually interspersed songs and lyrics . The writings of the highly cultivated and widely traveled gentleman John Evelyn ( 162o-1706 ) reflect in many ways the quality of his age . Most of his writings were done after the Restoration and were designed to promote English culture . They deal with a variety of subjects ? art , architecture , engraving , gardening , agriculture and horticulture , history , politics , commerce , education , and morals . His most important work is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott said he had never seen a mine so rich . ' It covers the whale of Evelyn 's life from 1620 to 1706 , but seems to have been begun as a daily record when he went abroad on his travels about 1642 . Evelyn was graduated from Balliol College , Oxford , , was always a man of wealth , and , although a Royalist , // managed to save his estate from confiscation by non-participation in the king 's war . He traveled instead for four years in Europe , and his record for that period is very full . He was then a traveler and sight-seer . What he puts down later are the life , experiences , and opinions of a country gentleman of easy fortune , amiable disposition , and scientific and antiquarian tastes . He is no Pepys in the acuteness of his observations and the intimacy of his revelations , but the Diary is none the less a work of much interest . Evelyn belongs , for the most part , to the next section of this history of literature and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EARLY LIFE AND WORK OF MILTON MILTON 'S life falls into three divisions , very different from each other in circumstances , temper , and literary work , and one is almost obliged to begin with Milton 's life in order to arrive at an understanding of the man and his work . The Milton problem is in this respect a modern problem , for the day had come when writers talked more openly about themselves . Perhaps the Renaissance had made some change in the attitude of the individual toward public expression , perhaps the writers of the seventeenth century had so far established their independence of the writers of antiquity that they sought to express themselves in relation to their times , just as Cicero and Horace had done in the earlier age . Writers in all ages have revealed themselves to a greater or less extent , but the seventeenth century seems to show a new lyrical and personal impulse in its utterances . In Milton 's case one feels that he could not have done anything else . There was about him a sort of lofty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , as the world affected him , it revealed its general nature and principles . He stood forth to himself as a typical human personality endowed with unquestionable moral seriousness , intellectual integrity , and unswerving purposes . One might be disposed to cavil at this when one feels the rough edges of Milton 's sternness if it were not true that Milton was , so far as justice can determine , exactly the upright and gifted creature that he thought himself . The period of his early poems , that of his young manhood , comes to an end with his return to England after the Italian journey in August 1639 ; the period of his prose work , mainly controversial but touched in many places with profound moral , political , and religious thought , ends with the restoration of Charles II , as it had begun with the Scottish outbreak against Charles I ; and the last period , the period of the great poems , ends with Milton 's death on 8 November 1674 . We have to do in all three of the periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plainly marked . John Milton was born in Bread Street , Cheapside , London , on 9 December 1608 . His father , also John Milton , was a scrivener who had acquired means . He also enters into the story , since he gave Milton from early childhood the best education the times afforded and supported him through a very long period of preparation . The elder Milton was an artist himself , a musician of some distinction , who perhaps believed in the integrity of the artistic soul . He showed patience , certainly faith , and the results of his policy helped give the world one of its greatest poets and greatest men . Milton speaks with gratitude of the ungrudging care bestowed by his father on his early education . Both at the grammar school 322 // and also under other masters at home , ' he says , he caused me to be instructed daily . ' The school referred to was the famous St. Paul 's School , although there are no records preserved showing the dates of Milton 's attendance . Among Milton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youth of Italian blood to whom Milton was devotedly attached . The year that King James I died and King Charles I came to the throne ( 1625 ) Milton entered Christ 's College , Cambridge , being then in his seventeenth year . He remained at Cambridge for more than seven years and took his B.A. degree in 1629 and his M.A. in 1632 . The university curriculum was still of the kind that had been followed with few changes since the Middle Ages . It was made up of the Seven Liberal Arts and the Three Philosophies . The procedure was drill in disputation , which meant also in Latin composition . Besides the statutory authors , mainly Latin , there must have been a good deal of study of Greek authors in Milton 's course , and Cambridge was at that time making progress in mathematics and natural science . Milton was very studious and must have made great advancement at Cambridge . His ability was tested and developed by his performance ; and , although there were no examinations and grades , there were exercises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that he won intellectual leadership in his time . We have testimony to this effect , and , still better , Milton has preserved for us a considerable number of his academic exercises both in English and Latin . Anthony a Wood says that Milton performed all the collegiate and academical exercises to the admiration of all , and was esteemed to be a virtuous and sober person , yet not to be ignorant of his own parts . ' The testimony is plausible , and the latter part of it is confirmed by Milton 's own claim to a certain niceness of nature , an honest haughtiness , and self-esteem of what I was or what I might be . ' Milton 's university career , although successful in the end , was not without one characteristic and unfortunate episode . His first tutor was William Chappell , and with him Milton had some disagreement , we do not know what . Aubrey , who was a gossip , in recording it wrote in a note to the effect that Milton was beaten by his tutor . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story wide currency . Corporal punishment had been common enough in the earlier history of the colleges , and Milton may have been whipped as a late case . Milton was certainly rusticated , although in such a modified fashion that it did not cost him a term of residence , which was the usual penalty . When he returned , he was placed under a different tutor , and the thing looks as if Milton was not without sympathizers among the dons of his college . Milton on leaving Cambridge speaks of the respect and deference that was paid him there , and it is known that he might have been elected to a fellowship in his college had it not fallen by royal favor to Edward King , a young Irishman , his . 324 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , I485-1660 junior by a year or more and we may believe his friend , in whose honor the later wrote Lycidas . By the time of Milton 's graduation from Cambridge John Milton , the elder , had retired from business in London and taken up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seventeen miles from London . Here in apparently perfect leisure Milton spent six years during which he carried out a course of systematic reading in the Greek and Latin classics , with the study of mathematics , music , and the cosmographical sciences . He was not necessarily happy or satisfied with himself and his progress . A letter to Diodati shows uneasiness and is brought to a close with the sonnet , On His Having Arrived at the age of Twenty-Three . ' The Horton period is nevertheless one of real poetical importance and has left behind a number of great works . Just when various ones of Milton 's earliest works were written is not clearly known . Coming from the time of his residence at Cambridge are the Prolusions , a body of academic exercises , seven Latin elegies ( two addressed to Diodati ) , five Latin epigrams about the Gunpowder Plot , five pieces grouped as Sylvarum Liber , and some very brilliant English poems , which vary in value , but are perhaps nowhere equaled as juvenilia . On the Death of a Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-born child of his sister Anne , who was married to a man named Phillips and was later the mother of Milton 's pupils , John and Edward Phillips . The magnificent ode On the Morning of Christ 's Nativity , ' a specimen and prediction of what Milton was to become as a poet , belongs to 1629 , and the lines On Shakespeare , ' the first published work of Milton , since they were prefixed to the 1632 edition of Shakespeare 's Comedies , Histories and Tragedies , were also written , Masson thinks , in 1629 . The two comic poems On the University Carrier ' belong to 163o-31 , and to the latter year , Epitaph on the Marchioness of Winchester ' and the lovely sonnet To the Nightingale . ' As to L'Allegro and It Penseroso , the opinion was long held that these poems were most properly to be placed in the Horton period , since they show Milton contemplating the world he was about to enter from two contrasting points of view . Some later scholars have , however , been disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in the university . The poems would be equally appropriate and natural utterances in either situation . L'Allegro and Il Penseroso are to he regarded as Milton 's true beginning as an English poet . They show Milton 's connection with Spenser and his kinship with Browne of Tavistock , the Fletchers , and probably Wither . The verse he uses , a skillful blend of iambic and trochaic meter , was not unknown , but nowhere is it more harmoniously employed . Three short pieces of great beauty and originality are usually assigned to Horton : At a Solemn Music , ' On Time , ' and Upon the Circumcision . ' Apparently from about 1633 there dates a fragment called Arcades , always properly associated with Comus . Arcades was part of a pastoral masque got up by the family of Sir Thomas Egerton in honor of their grandmother , the celebrated dowager-countess of Derby , and was played at her mansion of Harefield . Henry Lawes , the musician , a friend of Milton 's , probably got Milton to write the libretto . Arcades is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhymed couplet , a measure given op even before Comus was written . Arcades afforded Milton his first practice ill the masque or in any drama , // and , when he continued it in Comus , he produced what is recognized as a masterpiece in the form of the masque even when compared to the work of Jonson . Comm- has a more serious plot than was usually embodied in masques , and Milton took suggestions for it from Peek 's The Old Wives ' Tale . It is of course a very simple plot , but has a strong moral import and thus gave Milton opportunity for an idealistic presentation of virtue : Mortals that would follow me , Love Virtue , she alone is free , She can teach ye how to climb Higher than the sphery chime ; Or if Virtue feeble were , Heaven itself would stoop to her . Milton called the piece A Masque presented at Ludlow Castle , 1634 , before the Earl of Bridgewater , Lord President of Wales ' and the name Comus ' was supplied apparently by Lawes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawes wrote the music and was stage manager and one of the actors when the masque was presented as part of the festivities held on the induction of the Earl of Bridgewater to the Lord Presidency . Lawes was the Attendant Spirit , and the three youngest children of the earl played the parts of the Brothers and the Lady . It was by all accounts a brilliant occasion and was illuminated and made interesting by these personal features . In 1637 Milton 's mother died , as also Edward King of Christ 's College . King was drowned at sea on his way from Chester to Ireland , and late in 1637 Milton wrote Lycidas , included in a collection of elegiac and commendatory verses in Greek , Latin , and English by King 's friends , mainly at Cambridge . The poem was signed with the initials J.M. Lycidas is in the form of a Theocritean elegy , being made up on the pattern of a lament , a procession of mourners , and an epitaph . The chief mourners are Poetry , represented by the fountain Arethuse ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets and of Virgil , respectively ) ; Learning , represented by Camus ( or Cambridge ) ; and the Church , represented by St. Peter . The figures are striking , and that of St. Peter most significant in what it reveals of Milton 's opinions . No passage in Milton is better known than that in which St. Peter denounces the hirelings and marauders who creep and intrude , and climb into the fold . ' a It is an undisguised attack on the corruption of the clergy in the Established Church . The Miltonic style of elevated , sonorous , and often stern dignity appears in Lycidas , and the romantic sweetness and Spenser-like idealism of Comus are no longer obvious . In April 1638 Milton began his European travels , the recognized fashion of completing an education . His continental tour was a sort of minor triumphal progress and afforded him delight and benefit . He was provided with letters of introduction to distinguished persons and was everywhere received , as Sidney had been many years before , with attention and hospitality . He visited Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Florence . At Florence he stayed for two months and was associated with the literary groups or societies that characterized . 326 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 Florentine cultural life . Milton went then to Siena and to Rome , spending another two months with great delight among the antiquities of the great city . He went next to Naples , and there as elsewhere met the leading literary and scholarly people of the place , among them the aged Manso , Marquis of Villa , friend and biographer of Tasso . At Naples he learned of troubles in England and patriotically decided to return home , although he had expected to extend his journey to Sicily and Greece . The sad news of civil war in England , ' he says , called me back ; for I considered it base that , while my fellow-countrymen were fighting at home for liberty , I should he travelling abroad for intellectual culture . ' Although one can not question Milton 's decision , it is a pity he did not visit Greece . Milton started hack home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spent two months more in Rome and two months more in Florence , where he met , as he tells us in Areopagitica , the aged Galileo , a prisoner to the Inquisition . He made also a visit of some weeks in Geneva , where he met the uncle of Charles Diodati , and learned from him of the death of his friend . He then proceeded home , arriving there in August 1639 . He had been on the Continent for fifteen or sixteen months . He had done a good deal of poetical composition during his travels , most of it in Latin . There were five sonnets and a canzone in Italian , which celebrated the charms of some lady he had met , the rest in Latin : two Epistolae Familiares , three Latin epigrams , and a dignified poem in Latin hexameters Mansus , in honor of Manso . At the very end of the period came his greatest Latin poem , an elegy on Charles Diodati entitled Epitaphiunz Danionis . Competent critics have declared it superior to Lycidas . It is certainly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Milton thought of himself as a professional poet and that he was at that time contemplating an epic on King Arthur . Such is the account of Milton 's first period . He was thirty-one years old in 1639. 2 . THE PERIOD OF THE PROSE WORKS Whether Milton had expected when he decided to abandon his travels to participate in the wars when he returned to England , it is impossible to say . When he had returned , nothing political stood out with any definiteness , and in these circumstances Milton took lodgings in St. Bride 's churchyard and probably early in 164o hired a pretty garden-house in Aldersgate and undertook the education of his nephews , John and Edward Phillips . He seems to have liked teaching and to have kept for several years a small private school . He seems moreover to have been successful . We have double testimony hearing on Milton as an educator . His nephew and biographer , Edward Phillips , gives a careful and satisfied account of the activities of Milton 's school . We have , besides , Milton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of a letter to Samuel Hartlib . Milton 's letter is an elegantly written and detailed account of the activities of learners . The quantity of reading is so great and the ground to be covered so extensive that modern readers almost universally declare that Milton 's is an impossible program . The attention of the pamphlet is directed toward subject matter , and languages are regarded merely as tools , not as ends of study , and are to he acquired more or less incidentally . Every aspect of life , training , and the acquisition of knowledge is taken in the // stride . But there remains an unsolved question . Milton 's scheme does seem to have worked for himself , for his pupils , and for many of the most learned and scholarly men of the Renaissance . In arriving at a solution we are , first of all , to remember that in his own scheme Milton was a preceptor and fellow-worker and not a teacher . Secondly , we are to remember that Milton 's scheme is designed to take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of letters he should employ the pen rather than the sword , and we find him launching forth , unprovoked , as a volunteer in the conflict which he regarded as fighting for liberty . Bishop Joseph Hall of Exeter had issued a strong argument on the High Church or Laudian side of the national religious conflict entitled Humble Remonstrance to the High Court of Parliament . In answer to Hall five Puritan ministers issued a pamphlet under the strange name of Smectymnuus , ' a word manufactured by arranging the initials of their names in at least a partially pronounceable form . One of these was the Thomas Young , who had been Milton 's private tutor in London before his going to Christ 's College . Hall replied , and the Smectymnuuans rejoined , and the controversy waxed hot . Milton entered it with his first controversial work , which was entitled Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England and the Causes that hitherto have hindered it ( 1641 ) . It is one of the weightiest and most reasonable pamphlets that Milton ever wrote . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work is devoted to showing that the reformation of religion in England had never been completed and that it should now be carried out fully as in Scotland and in certain lands on the continent of Europe . It was followed by four more pamphlets in English , the very titles of which are a burden . Milton 's temper gets ruffled and he takes on the unpleasant , savage , and jeering tone all too common with him later and characteristic of religious controversy from the time of Tyndale and More until the establishment of religious toleration after the Revolution of 1688 . The most important of these pamphlets and perhaps the greatest of Milton 's religious controversial writings is The Reason of Church Government urged against Prelate ( 1642 ) , not that it is a wholly lovely thing . He argues against episcopacy on Biblical grounds , handles his adversaries personally and roughly , speaks ill of some of his poetical contemporaries , and says that poetry was his own true vocation . He states that he has been meditating a great poem or poems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noises and hoarse disputes , ' and that , although he uses only his left hand in the service of his country , he will use it with all his might . The sonnet , When the Assault was intended to the City , ' belongs to this time . Milton 's marriage , which probably occurred in the summer of 1643 , is regarded with apparent reason as a most unfortunate adventure . He expressed later and probably entertained at that time rather stern , or shall we say Biblical , views on the subject of woman 's function in marriage and in the world . It is easy to imagine that Milton may have been much in the wrong , but it seems unfair to use largely speculative accounts of what must have been a most mortifying personal experience to determine Milton 's views on marriage when we have the full , reasoned , and adequate study of the problem in Paradise Lost and elsewhere . The facts of the marriage are these . In the summer of 1643 Milton made a visit to Oxfordshire and married Mary Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esq. , of Forest Hill , near Oxford . The Powells and 328 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 Miltons had been acquainted before and had had business transactions with one another . Richard Powell owed Milton 's father a considerable sum of money . Milton brought his bride , who was seventeen years old ( he in his thirty-fifth year ) , back with him to London . The young wife had hardly been left alone with her husband before she sought to return home on a visit to her people . Milton gave his consent on the understanding that she would return to him at Michaelmas . She did not come , he wrote letters in vain , and sent a messenger . It is said that the messenger was repulsed . ' The only bit of background that seems to have any value is that the Powells were Royalist and Milton was Parliamentarian . A sort of confirmation of this comes from the fact that , when the fortunes of war turned so black a face to King Charles and the Powells were consequently endangered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young wife to London and to arrange a meeting between her and Milton . She begged his forgiveness on her knees and he , like Adam in the profoundly moving scene in Paradise Lost , forgave her . Milton took a larger house and gave refuge to members of her family . On these simple facts one would be justified in concluding that Milton behaved well . But there is a literary aspect to this matter . He put forth without his name , but without effort at concealment , a ringing protest entitled The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce , Restored to the good of both Sexes ( August 1643 ) . We of the modern world understand Milton and are familiar with his arguments , but at the time nothing could have been more scandalous to Episcopalian and Presbyterian alike . He had not discussed His own case , and he did not retract or apologize . In February 1644 he issued an enlarged edition , which he dedicated to Parliament and to the Westminster Assembly , which was then in session . He was denounced from pulpits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had found that Martin Bucer had expressed liberal views on divorce before him , and in the summer of 1644 he issued The Judgment of Martin Bucer concerning Divorce . In 1645 there appeared now openly under his name two other divorce pamphlets ; one of these , an elaborate Biblical argument called Tetrachordon , has been made familiar by Milton 's sonnet which refers to it , On the Detraction Which Followed upon My Writing Certain Treatises . ' Proud scorn of the ignorant and the narrow-minded has perhaps never gone further than in this sonnet . But the divorce pamphlets themselves are minimized by one of the results they produced . The Long Parliament , which of course had no tendency toward liberalism , had passed just before Milton 's first divorce tract a printed ordinance requiring all publications to be licensed by one of a board of censors . Milton had violated the ordinance and was prepared to violate it again . The matter came before committees of Parliament , and Milton addressed to the Parliament his famous oration , Areopagitica , a Speech of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parliament of England . This appeared in November 1644 . Here again Milton , confronted by a private issue , defended himself in general terms . Areopagitica is Milton 's greatest prose work and has become in Britain and America the original document on the subject of the freedom of speech and the press . His style in at least parts of the address is the acme of the prose style of that eloquent age ; not Browne or " Taylor or Donne or Bacon // It was not Milton 's courage and eminence and favorable political connections only that saved him from prosecution in the matter of the divorce pamphlets . It seems rather that the mind of the times underwent a sudden liberalization . Ideas , after centuries of repression and indifference , were abruptly turned loose in the England of that day . Reform progressed further in a few months than it had during many years before . Almost no institution remained unassailed , and almost no ultra-radical idea known to the modern world failed to find expression . In 1645 Milton gave notice to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Poems of Mr. John Milton , both English and Latin , composed at several tines . He wrote also sonnets , " On the Detraction which followed upon my writing certain Treatises , " To Mr. Henry Lawes on his Airs , ' To the Religious Memory of Mrs. Catherine Thomason , ' On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament . ' The last mentioned , a furious invective , shows Milton 's complete break with the Presbyterial party . The Parliamentary forces were victorious and the king beaten , but there was no reaction on Milton 's part , then or later , in favor of the king . In 1648 he wrote the sonnet to Fairfax , and his was the first open argument in favor of the establishment of a republic and the punishment of the king . It is entitled Tenure of Kings and Magistrates , proving that it is lawful , and hath been held so in all ages , for any who have the power , to call to account a Tyrant or wicked King , and , after due conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary Magistrate have neglected , or denied to do it . f1 nd that they who of late so much blame deposing , are the men that did it themselves . Milton had been at work on this pamphlet beforehand , but it was not published until about a fortnight after King Charles I was beheaded . It is a sane , reasonable , and rather dreadful work . Those who believe in or have sentimental attachment to the institution of autocratic kingship did not like it and will never like it ; but it is the stern voice of the power of the people , and nobody knows how the people may rule except by making their will felt . It caused the Parliamentary government to hire Milton 's pen for the support of their principles by making him Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Council of State in the new Parliamentary republic . Before long an occasion arose in which Milton was badly needed . There had appeared in 1649 a very appealing work called Eikon Basilike . Nobody to this day knows who wrote it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose execution had caused great shock in Britain and in Europe . This hook , whose title means The Royal Image , ' circulated widely and with deadly effect against the Parliament . Milton was called upon to answer it , and this he did as best he could . Perhaps his hitter tone and personal invective , with point by point refutation , were the most effective things he could do , as they were certainly what was expected of him ; but one feels that he ought to have continued the reasonable vein in which he begins his answer . He called his book Eikonoklastes ( 1646 ) , which means Idol-smasher . ' Milton was more successful in his next controversial work . This was Pro Pofulo Anglicano Defensio ( 1651 ) . There had appeared on the Continent in 1649 Defensio Regia pro Carolo I. It was a vindication of Charles I and an attack on his enemies in the new commonwealth , an appeal to the public opinion of Europe . It was written by the great scholar Salmasius of Leyden . Milton 's reply was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion in 330 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 Britain and abroad . It is memorable to the world , because , according to Milton himself , it cost him his eyesight . The Defensio was answered extensively , and in reply to the replies he prepared the Defensio Secunda , which was published in May 1654 . To us it is a very valuable document . Milton had been attacked personally , and in this pamphlet he took occasion to tell who he was and to detail the circumstances of his life and the motives that had actuated it . Little else is to he said in favor of the Defensio Secunda , which demolishes , in the worst vein of vituperation , one Alexander Morus , who was not , although Milton thought he was , the author of the work to which Milton was making a reply , Regii Sanguinis Clamor , really by Peter du Moulin , who was writing secretly in England itself . The year 1652 , when Milton lost his sight , was marked by two great sonnets , which accompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cromwell ' and To Sir Henry Vane the Younger . ' After Cromwell turned out the Rump Parliament and dismissed the Council of State in 1653 , Milton continued his activities as Latin secretary , with assistance provided and pay diminished . His Letters of State ( in Latin ) , after various vicissitudes , were published by Milton 's nephew , Edward Phillips , in 1694 . Milton 's On the Late Massacre in Piedmont , ' which is the voice of the suffering world in these days as in those , was written in 1655 . Mary Powell , Milton 's first wife , had died in 1652 , leaving him three daughters , whom biographers have been disposed to regard rather badly and toward whom Milton himself seems to have had little affection . They were young girls in the hands of a stern and abstracted father , with apparently little provision made for their present or their future happiness , and they may not have been as black as they are painted . Four years after the death of his first wife , he married a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom he seems to have been tenderly attached . After fifteen months she died in childbirth , and it is about her that Milton wrote that most touching of all his sonnets , Methought I saw my late espoused Saint . ' Nothing shows Milton 's obliviousness of what was , in favor of what should be or might be , better than the tenacity with which he fought for his views to the very end . Cromwell died on 3 September 1658 , his son Richard was unable to carry on as his great father had , and Puritanism as a political party was doomed ; but Milton sprang into , an activity that , except for miracle , would have cost him his life . In October 1658 he re-issued the Defensio prima ; the next year he wrote and published his Treatise of Civil Power in Ecclesiastical Causes in advocacy of the separation of Church and State ; he followed that in 1659 with his bold Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove Hirelings out of the Church ; and on the eve of the Restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pamphlet of sustained earnestness , The Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth , and the Excellence thereof Compared with the Inconveniences and Dangers of Readmitting Kingship in This Nation . Milton , with more valor than discretion , went down fighting . Charles II came in with an acclamation whose loud heartiness and noisy sentimentality helped to conceal the fact that the very people who welcomed him had driven him into exile . How Milton escaped the scaffold is still a mystery . Biographers // have attributed his escape to the intercession of Marvell or Davenant or to the safe Royalist position of his nephews . One would prefer to think that he was simply forgotten . Milton was blind , had always been personally inoffensive ; his pamphlets then as now were hard reading ; the king and his officials were no doubt very busy , and the king was not vindictive . Milton went into retirement , if not hiding , for a while , and when his name did not appear among those who were excepted from the king 's pardon in the Indemnity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own way . 3 . ' PARADISE LOST , ' ' PARADISE REGAINED , ' SAMSON AGONISTES ' At this time Milton certainly presented the spectacle of a ruined man , and no one could have imagined that he would yet do work that would place him in the forefront of the world 's poets . But there were certain things in his favor . First of all , there was the Miltonic will to do . He had never given up his lifelong intention to write great poetical works . Secondly , after a storm of earth-shaking proportions , he at last had leisure . His blindness has been described as a positive advantage , but this is of course questionable . It may have added something to his mental tenacity , since he had to hold in mind as units his great sentences and paragraphs ; and perhaps , since his procedure was perforce oral , his blindness may have done something to develop his magnificent harmony . In February 1663 he married a third time , Elizabeth Minshull , a good woman who took care of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Milton 's estate had suffered , he still had enough to secure him from want . In these circumstances , at the age of fifty-two , the blind man sat down to undertake his life work . It is idle to speculate whether or not Milton 's long and as a whole unfortunate political life was a necessary factor in the making of his great poems . They might have been as great or greater had life been more kind to him . The admirable thing is the man 's character , his phoenix-like rise from the ashes of his past . One more prose work , this time in Latin , needs to be mentioned before we consider Milton 's great religious epic . It is De Doctrina Christiana , which was not published until after his death . A knowledge of it is necessary in the interpretation of Paradise Lost , because it shows that by the beginning of his last period Milton had emancipated himself from all established creeds and sects and had become , although an ardent and believing Christian , a complete individualist in religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation and damnation , can not be explained by easy reference to the tenets of some particular form of belief . Masson says of De Doctrina Christiana , The general effect is to show that , though he is rightly regarded as the very genius of English Puritanism , its representative poet and idealist , yet he was not a Puritan of what may be called ; he first wave , or that wave of Calvinistic orthodoxy which broke in upon the absolutism of Charles and Laud , and set the English Revolution agoing . He belonged distinctly to that larger and more persistent wave of Puritanism which , passing on through independency , included at length an endless variety of sects , many of them rationalistic and free-thinking in the extreme , till , checked by the straits of the Restoration , it had to contract its volume for a while , and to reappear , so far as it could reappear 332 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 at all , in the new and milder guise of what has ever since been known as English Liberalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Milton was a poet of real dramatic talent . He shows it in all his poems , in his sonnets , and particularly in Comas , which dramatizes the very problem of good and evil he was later to treat in Paradise Lost . At the end of his career appeared the drama , Samson flgonistes . Milton was familiar with the great Greek writers of tragedy ? Aeschylus , Sophocles , and Euripides . He also knew Shakespeare , Marlowe , and other dramatists of his own time and of the preceding generation . He chooses dramatic moments with great certainty , and his emphases are dramatic . From his college days he had been looking forward to the achievement of some large work or composition that would give full scope to the powers of which he felt himself possessed . He long considered the subject of King Arthur , but the Cambridge manuscript seems to show that by about 1641 he had virtually decided to treat the subject of the fall of Adam . He then planned to treat it in the form of a drama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the subject continually , and certainly by 165.5 he had written some part of Paradise Lost , in what form we do not know . The work had advanced further by 1658 , and , when he was forced into retirement in 1660 , he proceeded , blind as he was , with the great work . It was finished in 1665 and published by an obscure printer in 1667 . The compensation he was to receive was in payments of five pounds each and represented a total possibility of twenty pounds . The poem was not a failure even in the unfavorable period in which it appeared , but the operation of launching this great poem was relatively obscure . This does not matter now , and it is only to he remarked that Milton had decided upon a subject of the greatest epical potentiality and scope . Its growth in his hands may have caused him to abandon the dramatic in favor of the epic form . In approaching Paradise Lost it is to be remembered , first of all , that Milton was not a child telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an historical epic ; it is a modern poem . Its chronology is the life of every man every day . Adam and Eve are man and woman as they live in the world . This fact is elemental , and it means that in Paradise Lost we have to do with one of the broadest studies of religion and ethics ever undertaken . Its story is symbolic and one of immediate daily application , or it is nothing . The poem is Hebraic in substance . Milton follows Scripture , but interprets it with complete independence . Paradise Lost may , however , be said to be the greatest of all classical epics from the point of view of structure . Perhaps its greatest debt is to the . leneid , for it is the most Latinate of English poetry . It is full of classical learning and ancient mythology , but these things are subordinate to Biblical religion and Biblical lore . Milton chose blank verse as the nearest practical approach to the Greek and Latin hexameter , and in choosing blank verse he gained great strength , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spenser 's rhymed stanzas . Paradise Lost is nevertheless not neoclassical , but truly part and parcel of the Renaissance . The subject and theme are almost incredibly vast , at once wide-ranging and personal . If it ' ever had interest and value , it has them now and can never lose them . // Since Taine 's ridicule of the poem and his presentation of certain critical theses , the world has often accepted somewhat blindly a theory of the significance of the poem that destroys its universality theory is supported by the idea that Milton , who had rebelled against his king and the prelates of his country 's Church , had an unconscious sympathy with Satan , who rebelled against the government of the Almighty , and consequently regarded Adam with mere conventionality . To believe this is to Gallicize Milton , since it was his manifest intention to make Adam the hero of Paradise Lost ? Adam and his progeny down to us who are living today . One would attribute the excellence of Milton 's picture of Satan not to his sympathy with the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature , even the power and attractiveness , of evil . Another idea of the same vintage is that Milton thought badly of woman . That he thought her inferior in command to man there can be no doubt , since Scripture offers abundant warrant for such a view , since the opinions of Milton 's age supported it , and since it is somewhat obvious , speaking in very general terms , in a society biologically based ; but , if Milton thought woman really inferior to man , as distinguished from being merely diverse in nature , then his poem is below the level of the highest literary and vital truth . But he does not think woman absolutely , but only in certain respects , inferior . Nothing about Paradise Lost is better known than the arrangement Milton gave to the matter , but perhaps the full significance of the architecture of the poem has not been realized . After the pattern of Homer and Virgil he opened his poem in the middle of the action . He did what Horace described as plunging in medias rcs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary precedent . He was also rebuilding the action so that it would conform to the outlines of universal human experience in confronting inevitable choice . The effect of this rearrangement is to generalize the story and give it the pattern of man 's ordinary life on earth ; but we must remember that it is only the beginning of life , for the blood , sweat , and tears are still to come . Paradise Lost is not , like Hamlet , an account of man 's struggle with his environment . It is a picture of life in Paradise , which may represent the paradise of youth and innocence , and not a battle of life such as that in which Milton himself had been engaged . Paradise Lost has mainly to do with forces surrounding man and largely beyond his control , but to which he must adjust himself . It attacks squarely the ethical problems of illumination and decision , an illumination of both good and evil . I n this illumination Milton first makes clear his own relation to his task . He seems to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world will enable man to assert eternal Providence . ' When he says that he will justify the ways of God to men , ' he does not mean that God needs to he justified , but that man in his ignorance thinks that God needs justification . Milton hopes to instruct nun and disabuse their minds . The first and second books are devoted to a description of the forces of evil , which seems to be historical rather than systematic . This is certainly true of Satan 's host in the first hook , where the fiends are pagan gods drawn from the Phoenicians , the Hittites , and other peoples surrounding the ancient Hebrews ; 334 THE LITERATURE OF THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE , 1485-1660 from the Egyptians ; and from the Greeks , the last-mentioned being gently treated ; but there is more system apparent in the second hook . If one compares it to the Aristotelian classification of evils , used by Spenser , into brutality , vice , and incontinency , or to the theological classification into sins of hardness , sins of Pharisaism , sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain resemblances appear . Moloch , Belial , Mammon , Beelzebub might fit into one or another of these rubrics ; but Milton , like Bacon , shows little interest in ideal classifications of virtues and vices . There is a unity in variety in his conception of evil , and Satan seems to be a combination of all . Most obviously Satan is a leader gathering to himself all special tenets and issues of evil , thus narrowing and intensifying the field . There seems to be no rationale of evil ? Satan 's doctrine is my will , not all the world ! Milton does not regard evil as mere absence of good , but endows it with action . The interpretation depends on one 's conception of evil . It is quite clear , however , that Satan is a destroyer , and God a creator and redeemer . The third book is a glorious piece of cosmographical poetry . Milton 's delineation of the cosmogony is less mathematically exact than that of Dante , vaguer , more romantic . Heaven is on high , incredibly vast ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attached with adamantine chains , hangs the universe . Enveloping it indefinitely is Chaos , where the elements are at ceaseless and purposeless war . At the bottom , beneath Chaos , is Hell , a vast bolted prison , a Hades . Within the universe is no vagueness , pure scholastic learning ? nine concentric spheres of diminishing size , with Earth at the center . As one moved outward ? the spheres of the sun and moon and the five planets ; next , the sphere of the fixed stars , the crystalline , the primum mobile on whose outward surface toward Chaos the Fiend walked up and down alone , bent on his prey . The Ptolemaic universe is no small affair , as Satan finds when he views from pole to pole its breadth . In the fourth hook Milton gathers up strength for his major task and begins , 0 for that warning voice , which he who saw The Apocalypse heard cry in Heaven aloud , Then when the Dragon , put to second rout , Came furious down to be revenged on men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Satan enters Paradise and beholds the innocent Adam and Eve . Satan is a creature of sorrow as well as terror , and Milton seems to say that sin and sorrow are sworn brethren engaged on a quest of frightfulness . Surely , it was an illmatched contest between the battle-scarred Fiend and the youthful lovers in the garden . They were indeed defenseless , but Milton 's point is that all men are defenseless . Compared to ourselves , Adam need not engage too much of our sympathy when we restore to our minds Milton 's conception of Adam . Adam possessed all knowledge , and , as Sir Thomas Browne says , Aristotle was but a fragment of an Adam . ' Adam was meant to he man in his perfection . In considering the fifth and sixth hooks , is it merely fanciful to see a similarity between the warfare in Heaven and man 's repeated wars and repeated failures to secure a lasting peace ? In the first day 's fight ( vt , 56-4o5 ) Satan and his : lee worsted. - Michael holds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely get ready for the second day 's fight , inventing explosives , devilish engines , and new techniques of destruction . They win a temporary victory and exult over it . It is only when the Son of God goes forth to war , on the third day , that evil is beaten and expelled from the kingdom of good . Milton seems to be telling us that peace must he sought for in the coming of the Prince of Peace . The seventh hook has been a stumbling block to the Uzzas of the world , because it is not in line with Darwin 's evolutionary hypothesis . It was a stroke of genius on the part of T. H. Huxley to speak of the traditional account of the Creation as Milton 's hypothesis ' and to show its improbability , to those who might he in need of such a thing , as a scheme to account for material facts . Why should he not ? Milton 's account is scientifically refutable , but in another sense irrefutable , because it is safe and secure in the realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line with the nature and purpose of God as , in his greatness of mind , he saw them . What is the significance of the forbidden fruit ? The text describes the tree as the Tree of Knowledge and seems to imply that those who eat of the fruit have thenceforth knowledge of good and evil . The results of this knowledge in Adam 's case were self-conceit , lust , shame , anger , and death . Those who ate of the tree became subject to death . Milton can not mean that virtue resides in ignorance and innocence . Indeed , he has given a most magnificent refutation of that theory in Areojagitica , where he rejects a cloistered virtue . ' Bacon puts forth the idea in the Advancement of Learning , and argues it strongly , using Scripture as a basis , that God does not wish to keep man in ignorance , but encourages him and has always encouraged him to learn about God 's works without restraint . Man may study not only the natural universe , hut the ways of God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues , to do so . The only limitation laid upon man is that he shall not assume that he possesses that . part of knowledge which is God 's special prerogative . He shall not put himself in place of God or supersede God . He shall not accept himself as God . lie shall not be a skeptic or an atheist . He shall not overthrow God 's religion in favor of a religion of his own . This , as far as it goes , helps us to understand Milton , although it is obvious that Bacon gives to man a wider liberty of inquiry than Milton does . If we regard the sin of Adam and Eve from the point of view of what we know of Milton 's ethical beliefs , it appears at once that their sin is primarily disobedience , since Milton has placed obedience ( and , let us say , discipline ) at the basis of his ethical system . Paradise Regained begins , I , who erewhile the Happy Garden sung , By one man 's disobedience lost , now sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm obedience fully tried Through all temptation , and the Tempter foiled In all his wiles , defeated and repulsed , And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness . Remembering that Paradise Lost is present in its application , and not historical or even theological , one may ask what will happen to a world that loses It . discrimination among ideas and its capacity for discipline . If we ask what
