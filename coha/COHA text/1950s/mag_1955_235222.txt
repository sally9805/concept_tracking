In days of old , the King 's whim formed the country 's reward : he gave to favored friends a forest , a few hundred serfs and an earldom . The very titles of prized orders ( e.g. , Knights of the Garter ) reflected the cozy household nature of it all . Last week Queen Elizabeth published her Birthday Honors List , rewarding 2,000 British and Commonwealth subjects , but the choice was largely the concern of her elected ministers , who operate on the principle that what is good for the nation is good for the Queen 's list . Only in the arts is the carefree caprice of the royal prerogative sometimes to be seen . The caprices made the headlines , but the top honors went to the most staunchly established pillars of a solvent society : Baronies ( with the right to be addressed as " Lord " ) went to Unilever Board Chairman Sir Geoffrey Heyworth , ex-M.P. and Bank Director Ralph Assheton , Merchant Malcolm S. McCorquodale and World Court Judge Sir Arnold Duncan McNair . Knighthoods ( and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the British West Indies ' onetime rabble-rousing Labor Leader William Alexander Bustamante , who used to cock a snook at Crown and Empire , to a covey of retired generals and admirals , and to a solid phalanx of businessmen . <P> The Order of the British Empire ( with the rank of Commander and the right to put the letters C.B.E . after their name ) went to Miler Roger Bannister , 26 ( see MILESTONES ) , and to Stage &; Screen Star Alec Guinness , 41 . <P> The Companion of Honor went to Sculptor Henry Moore . <P> The British Empire Medal was awarded to James Philip Bullen , chief officer in Her Majesty 's Prison at Edinburgh , to Alfred Chalk , Inspector of Flushing for the London County Council , and to some 300 other similarly deserving subjects . <P> In a list carefully weighed and balanced to avoid any unwonted partisanship , ardent Laborites , faithful aides of Prime Ministers Churchill and Eden ( including five members of Churchill 's secretariat ) , and deserving politicians in the dominions beyond the seas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name really caught the public fancy in a list largely devoted to bureaucrats rewarded and diplomats given titles appropriate to their jobs . <P> But in neighborhood streets , or in overseas dominions ( which accounted for nearly half of the Knighthoods ) , there were flashes of individual pride and pleasure as the list was published . Of all " the incongruous duties which our Constitution imposes upon the Prime Minister , " mourned Herbert Henry Asquith more than a quarter of a century ago , " there is none , in my experience , more thankless , more irksome and more invidious than the recommendation of honors to the Crown .
