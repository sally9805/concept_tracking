IN THE BELGIAN CONGO . OU would not recognize this country any more . Not if you expect the standard Congo script : jungle and steaming heat , tom-toms and cannibals . Civilization has come to inner Africa with a bang . You no longer have to worry about a black man eating you . He worries about you eating him ! Every year , somewhere in the Congo , it happens that the women stage a sudden raid on the school and take their children home . The missionaries , they have heard , eat children . Human meat , you see , was never eaten hereabouts for its food value , but for its spiritual value . Man eating is high-grade magic . If you eat the other man 's flesh , you thereby acquire his " life force . " So it stands to reason that the white man must eat people . How else could he be so full of force ? Full of force he is . The Belgian rule has made this part of Africa into a high-powered , modern country  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is upon it . The Belgians here own almost twice as many cars , percentage-wise , as we do in America . Most of the cars are American , brand new , and not " the low-priced field " either . The Belgian , heavy-set of mind and body , likes his car ditto . In the main cities , offices , factories and apartment houses are going up as fast as the cement can be hauled in . Leopoldville is by now ten miles long . It has a dual boulevard and quite a little skyscraper , known as " le building . " It has city water you can drink without filtering . The small towns back-country have grown even faster . Many have tripled their white population since the war . There is no dollar shortage here . The stores are full of American goods  --  right down to the American clip-on bow tie . Even the native village deep in the forest has a machine-age look . The villages used to drift around in the bush . They still drift  --  every few years the demons get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district commissioner now makes them always locate on a road or at least on a drivable track . It makes things easier for the police , the doctor and the agricultural agent . You can now penetrate by car , at least in the dry season , to just about every native but in the Congo . A missionary 's main tool nowadays is his pickup truck  --  maybe with a Bible verse painted on it , maybe with a loud-speaker mounted on it . The district commissioner also sees to it that the village is neatly laid out , on a square pattern of streets , like an American town . 102 ' HIE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 26 , 1952 Sure , life is still primitive in spots . But it 's primitive in a modern manner . The utilities are n't in yet , so you have your own little gasoline-electric plant . The road system does n't hang together yet , so you travel by air . When you get there , the hotel is right at the airport . Your airplane taxies up and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langewiesche and his wife have covered the length and breadth of Africa in their own light plane  --  Editors . All this the Belgians have done in fifty short years . In America , the Union Pacific Railway was old stuff when most of the Congo had never been seen by white man 's eyes . The great discovery was made in 1874-1877 by an American newspaper correspondent turned explorer : Henry Morton ( " Doctor Livingstone , I presume ? " ) Stanley . On a 999-day crossing of Africa from east to west , Stanley put his portable boat into a river that looked as if it might be the upper Nile . The river swerved and turned out to be the Congo . It was some trip . Poisoned arrows , disease , fatigue , drownings and crocodiles killed 234 of Stanley 's 346-man caravan ? including his three white companions . But it led to an exceptionally valuable find : the river , with its tributaries , was a vast ready-made interior transportation system  --  precisely the thing that most of Africa lacks . Stanley tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no takers . King Leopold II of Belgium snapped him up . Public and government were just lukewarm in Belgium as in England . But the king privately , as a rich man , founded a private association that claimed the power to raise armies , to make laws , to make treaties with chiefs  --  in short , to govern a country . In 1885 , at the great Berlin Congress on world affairs , the powers recognized this strange thing as the Congo Independent State , with Leopold as king . Its flag , the yellow star in the blue field , is still the Congo flag . The bearded face of " Leo Deux " still looks at you from walls and monuments all over the colony . In 1908 , Leopold gave his new kingdom to the Belgians as an outright colony . So , in a sense , Congo history dates back to the ' 70 's . But in those first decades the white man was busy merely establishing police posts , charting the rivers and making the peace . Warfare between tribe and tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to fight some bitter jungle wars against Arab slave raiders . The Wright Brothers were flying in America before the Congo was quite cleaned of slavery . The Belgians also had another key job to do : to connect their marvelous system of waterways with the ocean . The last few hundred miles of the river , down to the coast , have ferocious rapids ; the Congo was useless without a railroad to by-pass this stretch . The railroad was completed in ' 98 . For real colonization you can call 1900 the Congo 's year Zero . And now ? So thoroughly have they worked the country over that they have even changed the climate ? in a sense . The steaming heat  --  abolished . The deadly tropical forest  --  crossed off the map . Here 's the trick : along the big rivers the heat is indeed steaming , the forest deadly , even now . But the rivers are no longer the only transport route . Hence , you no longer have to live with the forest creeping down your back . Roads , railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beautiful grasslands , mountains with snow on them , or just plain bush . Most of modern Congo life is in those regions . Most of the Congo turns out to be " cold country with a hot sun . " In the Cop per Belt on a winter morning , you may find frost on the ground . If you could get permission to settle here  --  hard to get  --  it would amount to just about a $50,000 gift . You would be sure to wind up with that sort of stake , and probably much more . It 's that rich a country . The secret ? The driving force ? You think , of course , right away of uranium . But uranium accounts for only one small mining town in this vast country . It 's only one of many minerals they dig here , all of them valuable , some priceless . The biggest single thing is copper , of which the world is acutely short . They also dig gold , and tin , which is better than gold . And zinc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the world really needs . The hardest thing on earth , the diamond is priceless when it comes to cutting or drilling hard materials . They dig such stuff as cobalt , wolfram , cadmium , manganese  --  the kind of thing you mix with iron to get special steels that are hard or heat resistant  --  for jet engines , or high-speed cutting tools , or bearings , or gun barrels . Where they do n't dig things , they grow things . Here again , the Congo seems to have a talent for producing just the kind of stuff the world will buy at any price . Rubber , for example ; what the world runs on . The big product is palm oil , from vast European plantations , and from a hundred thousand native gardens . It 's used in steelmaking . But more important  --  it 's fat you can eat . Natives eat it as oil , Europeans as margarine . And any kind of fat is real treasure nowadays . With the " explosive " growth of populations all over the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , a famine of fat , in particular , is already here . They also grow quinine . They grow pyrethrum  --  the stuff that kills insects . Its special quality is the quick knockdown it gives an insect . That 's why it is still mixed , along with the newer poisons , in most insect sprays . American fruit growers are big customers for it . They grow coffee . Also tea . In many of these lines the Congo rides extra high now because the world 's former sources in Southeast Asia have become " politically unreliable " or still suffer from the Japanese devastation . But products are the result , not the cause . What makes the Congo hum is people ? black-skinned people . The Belgians , alone of all the colonial powers in Africa , have colonized the mind of Africa . They have got under the African 's skin and taught him how to work ? not only coolie fashion , with his muscles , but Belgian or American fashion , with his whole being . Well , more or less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  read this slowly  --  they did n't know the wheel , they had no plow , they did not use animal milk as human food . Even twenty years ago , when you hired a new man and gave him a hammer , he might grab it by the head and use it like a stone . Ten years ago a friend of mine was making a road . The earth-moving equipment was baskets carried on heads . He had some wheelbarrows shipped up the river . " Use these , " he told the gang . The next day he went back to see . " How 's it go ? " The foreman replied , " It 's very good , but , boss , it 's awful heavy . " They had been carrying the wheelbarrows on their heads . Today , Congo natives drive trucks and taxicabs , run power shovels , cranes , tractors , typewriters and adding machines . They click out Morse code . They captain river steamers . All loco- 104 people , ' Now , next time there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Climb on your roof , quick , with a pail of sand . And when a spark comes flying , kill it ! ' Well , they did climb on their roofs , but  --  with hand mirrors ! " That 's magic . You throw back the picture of the fire , and you feel you thereby throw back the fire itself . In general : you take a man 's hair , a leopard 's claw , a statue of a demon , and you burn it , bury it , eat it , bow to it . Even more in general : you take the sign or symbol of a thing and do something bodily with it  --  and you feel that thereby you influence the thing itself . This is not especially primitive . It 's a deep human need . We do it ourselves  --  especially with big things , and when we feel strongly . Only , when we take the hat off in church or salute the flag , we do n't think we have thereby done our bit for God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . What 's primitive about the African is that be lets it go at this handling of symbols . He forgets to tackle the " real " part of the job . Magic makes him blind to cause and effect . Instead of looking for the cause of a trouble , he always looks for a witch . At a textile mill a. worker said , " Boss , my Number Three machine  --  nothing comes out . Somebody has hexed it . " ' " Well , Abraham , " said the foreman , " let 's have a look . See that drive belt ? It 's reversed ; your machine is running backward ! " Magic is also behind his poor workmanship . He does a sloppy job . You scold him . If he trusts you , he will sometimes tell you the truth  --  as he sees it . " Boss , my heart went bad . Somebody ? " There you have it again . Somebody put a hex on him . That lets him out . You ca n't buck magic . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So what they say about the black man as a worker  --  is true . And for the white man it is the biggest problem of life in Africa . It is really the only problem . If you can make " them " work for you , you get rich . If you ca n't , you go broke or crazy , that 's all . But how , how , how can you make them work ? It starts the first evening when you sit down on the tropical hotel veranda and bellow , " Boy ! " The Belgians pronounce that more like : " Bo-ee . " . The colonial manner requires that you do n't look or turn your head ; just bawl straight ahead , " Boy ! " " Boss ? " " Bring beer . " It 's wonderfully lordly . But actually , right there begins your slavery to " them . " He may bring beer now or perhaps later . Perhaps lie brings coffee or nothing at all . Until he acts , he has your mind neatly tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost every conversation in Africa comes right back to " them . " " Nice hotel you run here , " I said . " It must be quite an art . " " Oh , yes , you have to know how to handle them , " said the manager . The guests ? Heck , no , the boys . And he started talking about how hard it is , with all the communist and American influences pervading Africa . " So you 're getting rich , " I said to a man who owns half the business in one of those booming small towns in the interior . " I am rich , " he said . " But then , I have worked hard for it . Eighteen years I was stationmaster on the railroad . That 's where I learned the natives . " It used to be a snap to make the natives work  --  back in ? the days of the January 26 , 1952 Congo State . You gave some chief a present and said , " Send your people out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , if the stuff did n't come forth , the chief used the whip or cut off a few hands  --  for disobedience to him , you see . The world heard about it . ( There is a famous American poem , by Vachel Lindsay , that shows Leopold II in hell , tormented by cut-off hands . ) To this day , the Belgians lean over backward to live down the " Congo scandals . " They have not used , for example , a handy device practiced elsewhere in Africa : " native reserves . " This is reverse talk . It really means you take the land away from the natives ; you leave them just enough to breed on , not enough to live on . So the young men have to come out and work for you . In the Congo , if a white man wants land , he can have it cheap . But he must show that no native uses it . This takes some showing . The elders of a village asked a friend of mine to build a mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be taken up in an almost empty region . The district commissioner called a big meeting with the chief , the elders and the missionary . They all wanted this school  --  the D.C. , too , thought it was a good thing . But he had to ask : " Do n't you need the land ? ... But wo n't your children need it ? . . . Your grandchildren ? " Any one " yes " from any one man would have queered the deal . " But do n't you sometimes graze your cattle on it ? ... But might you not want to drive your cattle across it on the way to some other spot ? " Well , it was " no " or all counts . Result ? The D.C. would report favorably , the papers would come through in three months  --  then the same meeting would have to be held over again ! In the short run , this policy does n't make the villager look for jobs . But the Belgians do n't want to push the people into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this begins right here , at the village . A man who has no job with some white outfit must make a field every year and raise a cash crop  --  peanuts , cotton , corn , manioc . It 's his field . The cash is his . But he must do it . By now , he wants to do it . When the agent de territoire comes to the village on his bike to stake out each man 's field , they no longer moan at the size of it . They ask for more . The money urge has be- , gun to work . That 's what the Belgians are betting on most  --  the money urge . Pump money into the native society , let people see what money can buy , and they 'll soon look for jobs that pay more . At the same time , the Belgians are jacking up wages on the plantations and in the mines . In fact , they pay perhaps a little more than the native worker is worth . Wages are still low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a day  --  and that only if you count in all the social services the worker gets . But labor costs are high in the Congo because the native is still so dreamy and uncertain a worker . The Belgians pump the money in faster , many people here think , than the native can learn how to spend it . Ike still spends it most readily on women and banana beer . But he has learned to want , at least , some things that do not grow on trees ? bicycles , phonographs , sewing machines , cotton prints for his women . You can see the money urge work in the towns , where the young bucks stand around the bicycle showroom , coveting . The Belgians love to see that . Said a high official , " I sometimes go visiting in the native town here and ask my old friends , ' Are you making out ? Is your pay enough ? ' Ninety per cent of them will say , ' Oh , Yes , I get enough . ' I consider that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety per cent discontented , wanting more money , like you Americans . That makes the wheels go round . " That is the Belgian formula : Africa 's biggest asset is its people . The white man 's biggest asset is his industrial methods . Get the two together . It seems to be mere common sense . That it is a daring policy you can see only if you look at the rest of Africa . The French , north of here , leave the native strictly alone ? at the cost of having almost no big-time economic development . They run the happiest Part of Africa . South of here , in the Union of South Africa , there is big industry , big agriculture . The native Must work because they have taken his land away from him . But he may work Only as an animal , with his muscles . He may wash the taxi , but he must not drive it . He may hand you the brick , but be must not lay it . It makes a gloomy , unhappy country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of making the black man an effective worker , other than digging on the farm . They imported Indian coolies instead , whom they knew how to handle . And now they wish they had n't . Whatever the white man is too lazy to do , the black man too clumsy , the Indian does . And that has given him a stranglehold on black and white . Only in the Congo is the black man patiently taught the White man 's methods . In the Congo a white man may not drive a taxi because a black man can do it , however badly . Typical of the new Congo is a textile ' still on Lake Tanganyika . It works up village-grown cotton into cloth for natives . The Rockefellers are backing it . They shipped over a whole North Carolina mill , lock , stock and barrel  --  all but the building . This makes it a good test case : same factory , different workers . Well , for every six men it used to take in North Carolina , it takes ten here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what stories the manager has to tell . They use incentive pay . Each man is in charge of several machines . The more steadily he can keep them running , the More he 's paid . A counting gadget on each machine shows how much it has tun . Easy to understand , fair , effective . Suddenly , production spurted incredibly . They investigated . There is a gadget on each loom that stops the machine when a thread breaks ; a jiggerdrops on a metal plate to make electric contact , and the machine switches off . Well , " they " had made an invention . You can bend this jigger a little , and then it misses the contact plate : the machine keeps going regardless . No magic here , you notice . It was intelligent engineering , Western style . The boss wanted the machines to run , and run they did . Only , like other engineers before them , " they " had n't quite appreciated the over-all problem . The fabric , woven with threads missing , was unsalable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid according to the counters just the same . Not to do so would have been a breach of faith  --  exactly the sort of thing you must never do with " them . " Some patient explaining , and production ran steady for a while . How to jack it up ? The manager announced that each month he would personally take a photograph of the best man in , each group . Production rose . But then it took a plunge . Big mystery  --  much patient talk and probing to find the trouble . One of the winners had got sick ? crazy , in fact . The witch doctor had blamed the photographs . So there had been competition in reverse . Nobody wanted to be top man ! The decisive step in Congo native policy was made in 1928 . Union Miniere ? the big copper-uranium outfit  --  then had several thousand workers at its Elisabethville " camp . " The " camp " then was the standard African affair  --  a company town of dormitories and little huts . The workers were mostly young fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short terms , most of them only to earn the price of a wife . In 1928 the company started sending men home on furlough to their villages : " Come back with a wife . " If the man had no money saved , they even advanced him the bride price . The big idea : they would stabilize their manpower . They would raise their own labor . A new generation would be born right here in the white man 's world , in industry . Other companies followed suit . That way , the Congo camp became something much better . Though still called a camp , it is in reality a school for living . " You must come and see our social work , " you hear everywhere in the Congo , before you can talk about anything else . You see dining hall and hospital and kindergarten and baby-weighing station and sewing school and carpentry school and maternity clinic , and attend perhaps a medal-giving ceremony for faithful service . Then you fly 200 miles of wilderness , get to the next mine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and milk issue and X-ray lab and cooking school and public-address system . It is not depressing . Here it is the successful and adventurous that have the social work done on them . It 's not charity , it 's part of the pay . It 's even fun  --  especially when they hand out the meat . The new worker does n't know how to feed himself a decent diet . So they give him part of his wages direct itvations . Twice a week the men line up near a blank wall with a hole in it . That 's the butcher shop . As each man steps up , an attendant bangs once on the wall with a club . A chunk of meat drops out of the hole . " You see , the whole ox has to be eaten , and this way we avoid palavers about who gets what cut . The butcher ca n't see . Even so ? you know , they have good ears for drumbeats . They still have ways of letting the butcher know who it is . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we change the signal man every week , to give another tribe a chance . " You can see it takes patience to do business in the Congo . You need big money . If production suddenly sags , it must be no skin off your personal nose ? otherwise you might start bullying . The small independent can stand the pace only if he is a genius at handling " them . " The small planter is , in fact , not welcome in the Congo . He would be too rough on his men . Besides , he would have to take land away from the natives . He is encouraged only where special skill is needed ? say , to raise cattle in tsetse-fly country and supply the new cities with milk and meat . Only one province , the Kivu , is planned to be a sort of " white highlands . " It 's beautiful  --  mile-high , with lakes and snow-capped volcanoes , cool . But it 's mostly a real-estate bubble developed by fear capital . Real Congo people dislike that : " Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Most Conga business is big business . The mining and big plantation companies control most of it ? transport , power , construction , retail , even automobile agencies . And the whole works is owned , at the top , by the big money in Brussels ? mainly by an octopus called , simply , La Societe Generale . Who owns that ? You somehow do n't ask . The royal family of Belgium is said to be in it . It 's probably fair to say that the big Congo profits go to the very wealthy , very quiet few . The state is closely allied with the big money . In fact , only a lawyer can tell the boundary line between the two . The two are partners in the railroads , the river steamers , the national air line . As owner of all minerals , the state is automatically partner in all mining companies  --  hence , indirectly , in most Congo business . It makes a strange form or capitalism . Said one businessman , " At some of our board meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you can see the point . What this government ca n't do as a state , it can ' always do as a luncheon club of business big shots . Government policy may come to you as an order from your boss . By this trick the Belgians swing their whole expensive , far-seeing native policy . That is the way they keep competition down , so nobody is forced to bear down too hard on his labor . If they let you operate at all , they see to it that you make out O.K. And that is the way , incidentally , they keep the BelJanuar : . 26 , 1952 gian Congo Belgian . By the old Berlin treaty , the Congo is open to goods and investors and immigrants of all countries alike , without any preferences for Belgian goods or nationals . Yet bumness is about 80 per cent Belgian . And so is the white population , if you skip the Anglo-American missionaries , since they are not here for the money . " How do you do it ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , " he grinned . " The climate simply favors Belgian enterprise . " It is just good manners here , if you want to start something , to cut in Belgian capital . Even " les Rockefellaires " hold only a minority interest in that textile mill . The Belgians appreciate that as a courtesy . Businessmen and officials run the Congo . But from the black man 's viewpoint , another kind of white man is more important : the missionary . He is the one white man who wants nothing , neither taxes nor work . He has no police power , he will never get you put in jail . All he wants to do is help . Almost the whole school system is run by the missions on government subsidies . The Protestant missions are in on this job too . But the big mass effort is Catholic . The missions are everywhere  --  in the new industrial cities and deep in the bush . They are important landmarks for the pilot  --  the flying maps have a special symbol for them . Seen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw roof with little roofs nestling around it , like hen and chickens ; sometimes a regular church and school of cream-colored brick , Flanders style . When you get down , you find the reverend fathers wearing white , not black . And they wear beards  --  long white ones if they can ; if not , the most formidable that gentle young faces will grow . It makes it easier for the native , who greatly respects old age , to call them " father . " One of the common sights of the Congo is the priest on his motorcycle , beard blowing in the wind . He gets around . He knows all , understands all  --  or does he ? Said Father Floribert , " I would give my thirty years in the Congo for one hour inside the head of one black man . " But anyway , he knows where the shoe pinches . Because of this , the priest is particularly cast in the role of protector of native interests , and sits as such on " protective committees " and government councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , " Hie face is white , but his heart is black . " The Catholic Church is powerful in Belgium , at the seat of power . It is powerful here because it reaches alike into the hearts of the native and the policeman , the district commissioner and the foreman in the mine . I asked a prince of the church one of those dumb questions , " What is the role of the Catholic Church in building this new Congo ? " He came right back , " The church supplies the cement . You can not build a society without something to make a bond between people . That 's why the Anglo-Saxon colonial work is n't lasting . They built without cement . And there is only one cement . " The Belgians think they will be in the Congo a long time . They have no thought of bowing out . There is no fear at all of being thrown out  --  not in the Congo . There is no wish to " keep the black man in his place , " as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to rise , and they want to rise with him . For the Belgians , the Congo has become a sort of West  --  a vast country to develop , which in turn develops them . They come here from a tight little Country , where one is careful , class-conscious and not too gay . They still come carefully , on three-year contracts with six months ' paid leave in Europe to follow . But something happens to them here that you might call an Americanization . The upper-class Belgian forgets a little about his university degrees and family connections , and becomes more human . You meet some elderly official , all dignity in white uniform with decorations  --  and you find he knows how to make bricks , how to build a house , how to deliver a baby  --  he 's done it . His speech breezes up . The lower-class fellow  --  he sheds that class Stuff . His personality expands . He earns More here , of course . He buys his first car . His driving shows it .

He becomes ambitious . Resign your job , start a hotel , a lumber mill , a truck line ? He sees how much Can be done , needs to be done . " It takes People about two years to learn to think big , " says an old-timer who has seen them come  --  and slay . A man goes home on furlough , and finds Europe too tight . He says , " This is my country now . " I 've even heard , literally , " I do n't want to leave the Congo ! " But if he wants to stay , he must toe the line . And what 's the line ' ? You come right back to it : the native . Everything In the Congo turns on this one idea . The native must evolve , develop . Toward What ? For the Belgians , it 's self-evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What else should the native become but a skilled workman or farmer , husband of one woman , head of a Christian household , a house owner ? /1 ' 1 short , a sound little citizen , Belgian style ? All of this more or less . But preferably more , and soon . The prize exhibit of the Congo is Elisabethville , capital of the copper-uranium belt . It is the most dynamic Place in Africa . It even looks dynamic . A giant chimney and a mountainous slag heap stand over the town likes symbol of industry . On one side of this thing is the white man 's city ? vaguely like Tulsa ? with restaurants where highpowered industrial types dine with elegant women among potted palms . On the very people that Union Miniere once sent out to get married , or their children . They have left camp . They are on their own . No longer does a man 's meat ration drop out of a hole .

But there are two-bike families now , and the rush hour is something to see ? bicycles five abreast , an endless stream , and a traffic policeman signaling stop and go . He goes out at night  --  to see Hopalong Cassidy , or to the Brussels Bar , or to the Caf ? Civilization . So there he is now , the so-called " tvolue " ?

You ask : Have the natives a vote ? Are there many native Ph.D . ' s ? How soon will they have self-government ? And on this score , the Congo makes no particularly good showing , and on purpose . The Belgians feel that their own formula is better : showing people how to produce food and houses and goods is better than showing them how to write Ph.D . theses . They feel that to give a witch-doctor-ridden people political rights is a poor substitute for giving them a place in your heart . They hope that history will give them time to complete their remarkable operation on the African soul .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
