POLITICAL NOTES Frank John Lausche , 58 , is the only governor Ohioans have elected for a fourth term . Last week , in a decision which set off speculation that he would run for President in 1956 , Democrat Lausche announced his candidacy in next year 's election for a fifth two-year term . <P> Lausche 's alternative was to swap places on the ticket with Senator Thomas A. Burke , the man he appointed to the late Robert A. Taft 's seat , giving Burke a chance for the governorship . But the political dangers of giving up his secure position in Columbus loomed large in Frank Lausche 's mind . In 1956 , as governor , he would have a vote-getting record unmatched by other Democrats , and he could confidently expect to control Ohio 's convention delegates . As a freshman Senator , he might weaken home-state ties , and he would have to jump into vote-losing controversies over national issues. * <P> Ohio 's governor is as politically unruly as his heavy mane of tousled hair . Ever since he was elected Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine " support , winning elections despite organized Democratic opposition . He has heaped such florid oratorical praise on some G.O.P. leaders that they find it awkward later to criticize him in normal partisan fashion . In the 1950 senatorial campaign , Lausche said he " might " vote for Bob Taft instead of the Democratic candidate . By last year the governor had won such popularity as a conservative Democrat that , in defeating Charles P. Taft , the Senator 's brother , he topped Adlai Stevenson 's vote by 415,000 . <P> Frank Lausche , Ohio 's first Roman Catholic governor , whose parents emigrated from Slovenia to Cleveland , has long had his eye on the White House . If he gets there , it will be surprising : no man of Eastern European stock and no Catholic has been President ; Andrew Jackson was the only President whose parents were both born abroad ( in Ireland ) . <P> <P> * No Democratic Senator has won a presidential nomination since Stephen Douglas ran against Lincoln in 1860.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
