txt The Roman Catholic Church still was without a Supreme Pontiff tonight after fifty-one Cardinals in conclave had voted four times . Twice during the day the fa . mous chimney rising above the roof of the Sistine Chapel of St. Peter 's Basilica emitted dense black smoke . This conveyed a signal to large crowds waiting in St. Peter 's Square that no candidate had received the required minimum of thirty-five votes  --  two-thirds of those vot. ing plus one . Both signals gave the impression at first that a Pope had been elected to succeed Pius XII , who died Oct , 9 , The Cardinals , who come front twenty-one countries , will resume their balloting tomorrow morning , Throng Raises Cry The first fumata , or smoke signal , was given at 11:53 A , M. It told waiting Romans that the Pope had not been elected in the two morning ballots . There was a second fumata at 5:57 , P. M. , announcing that the two afternoon votes also had been negative . The smoke that appeared shortly before noon was pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shouts of ' ' Viva Papa ! ( Long live the Pope ) " rose from the crowd in the square . Dozens of newspapermen in the square made a dash for the nearest telephones , Thousands of people started running toward the outside balcony of St. Peter 's , from which it was thought the new Pope would shortly be imparting his first apostolic blessing . Guests at a wedding , Inside St. Peter 's ran into the square with almost everyone else in the vast basilica , leaving the bride and bridegroom alone in front of a priest at the altar . Announcer Deceived Even a priest acting as an official announcer for the Vatican radio was deceived , He shouted excitedly : " It 's white , it 's white ! ' We have a Pope ! " His announcement was taken up by the Italian radio network and by the Italian news agency ANSA , The news thus went into millions of Italian homes . A few minutes later , however , the smoke signal was re ? peated and this time it was unmistakably black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells of the clocks at the top of the facade of St , Peter 's began striking noon . The smoke is caused by the burning of the Cardinals ' ballot papers in an iron stove in the Sistine Chapel , where the prelates were walled up yesterday to remain until they have selected the 262d Supreme Pontiff , When the voting has not given any candidate the required minimum , the ballot papers are put in the stove and burned with a handful of damp straw . This produces black smoke . When a Pope has been elected , the ballot papers are burned alone , which produces thin white smoke . It was , thought that this morning 's misleading signal resulted because the straw failed to catch fire at once . The second signal was misunderstood because it came well after nightfall . The smoke was lighted from below by a spotlight , which made black appear white . The Vatican radio announcer again stated that a new Pope had been elected . Again the news was flashed to the world . Again the crowds in St , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappointment reigned , The day was beautiful , with a hot sun shining out of a cloudless sky . So hot was it , indeed , and so thick was the crowd that a score of persons fainted and were carried away in ambulances after having received first aid in tents set up by the Knights of Malta . The crowd was composed mostly of Romans , but there was a fair sprinkling of tourists from many lands . There was also a great number of priests , monks and nuns , seemingly as wrought up and expectant as everyone else . Pigeons Circle Overhead When the first puff of smoke was seen a mighty shout caused the pigeons of St. Peter 's to rise and circle overhead . The joyful clamor changed into groans of disappointment a few minutes later when the black smoke started , The crowd slowly dissolved . An even larger crowd was gathered in the square this afternoon , It was swollen after 5 o'clock by many thousands returning from soccer matches . At 5 o'clock a vast flight of starling circled repeatedly around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to obscure the light from the setting sun . Romans below thought this was an omen of some sort , though they were unable to say what it portended . The crowd had thinned only a little when the second fumata came , The crowd lingered for more than half an hour , apparently hoping against hope that a new Pope would appear . Prince Sigismondo Chigi della Rovere-Albani , who as hereditary Marshal of the Conclave has to insure that the ' assem bled Cardinals remain undisturbed , conceded in a radio interview tonight that the smoke signals had caused con-fusion , Prince Reached Cardinals The Prince disclosed that he had used a prerogative of his office by making contact with the Cardinals , Presumably he asked them which color they had intended to give to the smoke . The broadcast quoted Prince Chigi as having expressed his intention to advise the Cardinals tomorrow to make sure their signals would be easily under-stood , , What has been happening inside the conclave can only be surmised or deduced from precedent . It may be supposed that most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many altars scattered throughout the enclosure . Then they presumably breakfasted together in the dining room prepared for them in the Borgia apartment of the Vatican . At 9 o'clock the sound of the big bell in the Courtyard of St. Damasus summoned the Cardinals to the Sistine Chapel . There , it is likely , Eugene Cardinal Tisserant , dean of the Sacred College , said mass and recited prayers invoking the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Ghost , The members of the Cardinals ' suites must then have left them in the chapel so that the voting could begin , The first thing the Cardinals had to do was choose by lot those who were to be in charge of the election : three scrutineers , or vote tellers , and three checkers , who count the votes a second time and keep a tally of how many votes each candidate has obtained . Three Cardinals ' also are appointed to receive the ballot papers of any who are too unwell to leave their apartH ments . Thomas Cardinal Tien Ken-sin , exiled Archbishop of Peiping , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal Frings , Arch ) bishop of Cologne , has a fractured spine . In the actual balloting , the Cairdinals , sitting on their thrones , fill out the ballot papers in a ' disguised handwriting and fold them lengthwise . The Dean , holding his ballot over his head , walks to the altar at ' one end of the Sistine Chapel . After praying at the altar , he must drop his ballot into a chalice standing on a table in front of it . As he does so he must say in a loud voice , " I call as my witness Christ the Lord , who will judge me that I elect under God him whom I believe I should elect , " Each Cardinal in turn , according to seniority , follows Cardinal Tisserant , voting in the same fashion . The votes are counted immediately afterward . If precedent is any guide , it may be surmised that the first vote was widely scattered , a number of Cardinals receiving a few votes apiece . It is customary for Cardinals to give " courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship . After the votes are counted and checked , the ballot papers are strung on a thread and placed in a second chalice . The second vote is taken immediately . When this also fails I the paper ballots are burned with the straw .
