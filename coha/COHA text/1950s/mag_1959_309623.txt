To outward appearances , Police Reporter Gene Grove , 34 , and Aviation Editor Harry Franken , 35 , are smart , hardworking newsmen on the daily Columbus ( Ohio ) Citizen ( circ. 85,942 ) . But once each week the two slip off duty and into the harness of the Columbus C.I.O. News , a weekly organ for organized labor . There Reporters Franken and Grove conduct a column called " Checking the Press . " Its purpose : to appraise the performance of the Columbus daily press , including their own Citizen , A recent example of their work in the C.I.O. News : " The Citizen has more and more sugar-coated its stories , has spent more and more time on the goody-goody type stories ... It gets downright sickening . " <P> Such backbiting has been going on since 1954. when Reporters Franken and Grove , both members of the American Newspaper Guild , a C.I.O. affiliate , offered their services-at $5 a week-as undercover editors of the C.I.O. News . The column " Checking the Press " had been introduced in 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forcing the daily papers to report the news that they now suppress . " <P> From their vantage point inside the Citizen 's city room , Franken and Grove expanded this charter into a broadside attack on the faults of the Columbus press , peppering not only the Citizen but its bigger rival , the Dispatch ( circ. 185,437 ) : " We believe the Columbus Dispatch has been grossly unfair and inaccurate in its reporting . " <P> Many of their shots went wild , but sometimes a snipe hit home . After " Checking the Press " exposed the high incidence of identical Citizen and Dispatch stories , the Citizen began rewriting pressagents ' handouts . With considerable Tightness , Franken and Grove pointed out that a football game for charity ( Philadelphia Eagles v. Chicago Bears ) , sponsored by the Dispatch and the Columbus Ohio State Journal , cost Ohio taxpayers $60,000 more than the take . <P> Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the Grove-Franken operation is that they have remained unidentified to their bosses-until this week . But the Citizen had long suspected that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of my men contribute to it , " growled Citizen Editor Don E. Weaver last week . " And it 's a dirty bird that fouls its own nest . " For all the fact that Grove and Franken have often criticized real Citizen shortcomings , Editor Weaver may have a point .
