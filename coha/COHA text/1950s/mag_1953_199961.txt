The Eisenhower Administration this week took its first major step to reverse the New Deal-Fair Deal " cheap money " policies and put the national debt on a sounder , long-term basis . On sale went a new issue of government bonds , with the highest interest rate ( 3% ) since 1933 , and the longest-term maturity ( 30 years ) since the beginning of World War II . It was also the first long-term issue in 20 years to be floated in an " unpegged " market , i.e. , the Federal Reserve is not committed to support the bonds at any fixed price . With the new $2 billion issue , Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey hopes to raise $1 billion in cash - his first venture into the new-money market-and refund a like amount of shorter-term savings bonds due in the next few months . <P> On news of the issue , the U.S. bond market , which has been sagging for weeks , sagged some more . Many a bond issued in the past with an interest rate of 2% or less looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , the lower price of old bonds brought their interest yield more in line with the higher rates of the new bonds . Last week victory-loan bonds , issued at a 2% interest rate in 1941 , dipped half a point to 93 9/10 , v. their issue price of 100 , giving them a yield of about 3% . <P> The Treasury 's new long-term issue was designed to 1 ) help relieve the U.S. of its constant sorties into the money market to refund short-term issues , and 2 ) provide a safeguard against more inflation by boosting loan rates all around and by tapping savings as they accumulate in life-insurance companies , pension funds and savings banks . The new bonds would also probably tap some money that would normally go into the stock market . <P> In any case , the business of " stretching out " the $264 billion national debt , now 75% concentrated in issues maturing in five years or less , will be a long and difficult job . Nine weeks ago , Secretary Humphrey offered investors a choice of fiveyear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $3.8 billion of maturing certificates ( TIME , Feb. 9 ) . The certificate holders took only $619 million worth of the longer-term issue . But as the bonds went on sale this week , it looked like a quick sellout.
