Consumer by Fostering Competition To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is evident that much confusion abounds as to the real meaning of the Kerr amendment to the Natural Gas Act how before the President for signing . It has been reported in THE NEW YORK TIMES that the ' bill passed ' the Senate and then the House with a majority of but two votes . Since the action by Congress it has been predicted by various sources that the people are to be robbed of their money to pay for the increased prices of gas , that the rich are gouging the poor , ' and that a few " interests " have succeeded in putting over a nefarious plot to fill their coffers at the expense of the general public . It may be helpful to point out the factual situation and to quiet the fears of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of desirable legislation is to encourage the production of abundant quantities of natural gas for long periods of time at prices favorable to those offered by other fuels ? e. g. , coal and oil . It is the writer 's belief that the Kerr bill will accomplish this result . In order to maintain low consumer prices for natural gas there must be adequate and continuing supplies . The history of the oil and gas industry shows , as a Matter of record , that when prices for these commodities are favorable in relation to costs , exploration effort arises which maintains supplies at levels consistent with a satisfactory price structure . So long as there is an adequate reward for the risks of exploration , drilling , production and recovery , there will be found the venture funds to carry on these hazardous undertakings . Subject to Regulations If the Federal Power Commission assumes control over the price of natural gas at the well-head , the commodity will , in effect , be subject to two , possibly three , separate sets of regulations : F. P. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public utility rate controls . It is probable that F. P. C. price control would be based on the net return after taxes , not more than approximately 6 per cent , on the computed cost of acquisition . This is ' the general plan upon which pipeline rates are determined today . The range of acquisition costs is very great . At the present time the price of natural gas at the . well-head is at an index of 88.3 , compared with coal at 108 and oil at 192 . It is well to note that the low price for natural gas prevails in the complete absence of price control at this time , and with a market demand many times that of the available supply . ' if there were adequate supplies of gas at the consuming markets , of the . Northeast , it is . safe to say that gas Would quadruple its present volume of consumption in competition with other fuels . The gas industry is well aware of the possibilities of ' this great market , and the planning of pipelines costing hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Power Commission , is contemplated in the face of strong competition of oil and ' coal . Therefore , the gas industry recognizes full well that these large outlays of capital funds can earn adequate return only on the basis of maintaining a healthy competitive price structure . Considering these factors together , there is but one logical conclusion as to future practices of gas producers in respect to price . The lack of federal regulation will not cause them to ' raise their well-head prices indiscriminately . If they yield to such temptation , they will sooner or later lose their markets . The natural competition of 5,500 independent gas producers among themselves is the best guarantee in this nation ' that consumers will not be gouged of money to fill the pockets of the rich . We can not say as much for federal price regulation of other commodities . Dwindling Reserves Although we now have 180 trillion Cubic feet of gas reserves , enough for thirty years at the present rate of consumption , this huge amount will dwindle to nine years ' supply in 194 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year . Meanwhile , under the incentive of a fair return on exploration and production costs , programs of exploration will be'organized to maintain . the nation 's gas reserves at safe levels . It is important to note that the oil industry has kept approximately thirteen years ' supplies in sight for more than twenty years , due to operation of economic laws involving balance of supply and demand in a competitive field . There seems slight justification for regulation of the price of mineral fuels at this time unless we wish to go allout for the specialized state . It is surprising to note the loud clamor of people who imagine the threat of domination by the " interests " to be at their very doors . If we desire abundant quantities of natural gas at competitive prices , the Kerr bill should become law . It is as simple as that . ROLAND F. BEERS , Head , Department . of Fuel Resources , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute . Troy , N. Y. , April 5 , 1950 . Removing Portion of El To THE EDITOR or THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to passengers alighting at the City Hall station of the Third Avenue Elevated good to the Brooklyn Bridge station of the I. R. T. Lexington Avenue Subway and the Chambers Street station of the B. M. T. Subway , the removal of . the South Ferry branch of the El from Chatham Square to South Ferry ' could be accomplished at once with little inconvenience to the riding public . The two subway lines run parallel to the South Ferry branch of the El . and are but a short- distance away . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Any propaganda that serves to obscure or to mislead the citizen as to activities of his Government strikes directly , in some measure , at his faith in our institutions . When one of his own elected representatives sees fit to utter irresponsible statements , then the damage to the respect and confidence of the institution of representation itself can be serious . The columns of THE NEW YORK TIMES have devoted considerable space lately to the dissemination of such statements by Representative Frederic R. Coudert Jr . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a resident . THE TIMES , of course , only performs its duty by so doing , for activities of that kind are of real concern . to anyone who believes in the great importance of government by representation . I refer ' to Representative Coudert 's intemperate statements concerning taxation . On March 14 Mr. Coudert announced in the House that he would introduce a resolution to repeal the income tax amendment to the Constitution and to limit the use of income tax by the Federal Government " only for the purpose of a grave national emergency proclaimed by the President and approved by each house of Congress and for the purpose of reducing the , national debt and payment of the inter . est thereon . " Mr. Coudert accompanied this ex. traordinary announcement with the assertion that the income tax is rapidly leading to the complete breakdown of the states and localities as effective instruments of government . He also spoke of a " reckless bureaucracy " and creation of " an overpowering central government . " Advocated Commission Three days later Mr. Coudert announced that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonpartisan commission to study revision of the federal tax structure . This time he asseverated that " If we continue to go on as we are at present , then the whole system of life in the United States will go overboard . * * * and we will have some sort of totalitarian set-up . " Of course , repeal of the income tax , by far the greatest ' single source of federal revenue , would bring about a national emergency of real dimensions , because it would mean , at once , that the Federal Government not only would be unable to furnish the minimum of ordinary services but would have to abandon any pretense of ' providing national defense . It is unnecessary to cite statistics in support of thisasser-tion . Hence , it is apparent why Mr. Coudert quickly dropped his promise to repeal the income tax ' and retreated behind the convenient curtain of . proposing still another commission . His next appearance in the columns of THE TIMES was in the role of sponsor of a proposal to have the Federal Government reach into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington Square , despite ' his cries against the growing authority of central government . It is not my purpose to chide Representative Coudert for his specific acts , but rather to call attention to the damage which such behavior on the part of any elected representati. inevitably must do , not merely to himself but to the respect for and faith in the body of which he is a member . Certainly all good citizens desire that taxation be equitable and that revenue be expended with discretion : If Mr. Coudert 's purpose was to advance the justness of taxation and the prudent use of revenue , his intemperate statements served only to vitiate a good motive . In times such as these it is vital that the members of the legislative branch of the Federal Government should conduct themselves in a manner to enhance rather than to lessen its prestige . IRVING M. ENGEL . New York , April 5 , 1950 . Communists in the Government To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : You have been quite critical of Senator McCarthy 's efforts to root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out ? Remember it was Harry Truman who said , when the Un-American Activities Committee was investigating Alger Hiss , that his investigation was a red herring . Well , that herring has been cooked , and it seems to me that it 's about time President Truman ate it . Of course there are a lot of Communists in the Government and there are a lot of pinks in the Government who are potential Communists and , of course , Truman and his other wildeyed Democrats , or rather men who call themselves Democrats , are trying to protect them . You take the position that invest ' . gating them aids Russia . Does leaving the Communists in our Government help us ? GEORGE E. STRINGFELLOW . East Orange , N. J. , March 31 , 1950 . The tearing down of this unsightly structure would ' make for rebuilding , for a widened and beautified Pearl Street and other streets , increased real estate ana tax values and a substantial saving in transit operating expenses .
