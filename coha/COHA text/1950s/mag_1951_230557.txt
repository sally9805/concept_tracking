Each year some 2,000,000 visitors roam the marble vastness of Washington 's National Gallery . Its 4 acres of art treasures cover the history of Western painting from Byzantium to Bellows ( George ) . The visitors always linger over such masterpieces as Giorgione 's Adoration of the Shepherds and Raphael 's Alba Madonna , but their favorite is one of the gallery 's least-assuming pictures-Auguste Renoir 's A Girl with a Watering Can . <P> This painting leads the gallery 's reproduction sales ; the guides are questioned about it constantly , and copyists prefer it to all others . Critic Roger Fry once explained Renoir 's popularity by remarking that the gentle master " liked passionately the obviously good things of life , the young human animal , sunshine , sky , trees , water , fruit ; the things that everyone likes . "
