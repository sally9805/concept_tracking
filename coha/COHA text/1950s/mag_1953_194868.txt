BATTLE OF INDOCHINA <P> Beneath the wan light of flare shells , the war in Indo-China moved into the seventh year . Said a red-haired Foreign Legionnaire : " We now have the oldest war in the world . " To the " Moles of Nasan " the usually frugal French commissary sent Australian beefsteaks , fried potatoes , vegetables , fresh bread , Algerian wine and 3,000 bottles of champagne-one bottle for every four men in the dusty , embattled airstrip . Thai and Vietnamese troops got frozen meat , dried fish and rice ; the North Africans had wine , live sheep and goats , brought in by airlift . In a dugout mess 25 feet underground , Nasan Commander Two-Star General Jean Gilles passed out cigars and liquors to his staff . Said bearlike General Gilles : " We 've done a nice job here . " <P> The French could afford a small celebration . General Vo Nguyen Giap 's Communist army was now in the situation previously occupied by the French : their forces were spread out thinly over a vast area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist supply lines were at that moment being attacked by Thai guerrillas , most pro-French of the tribesmen . On the other hand , the French were now concentrated in Nasan and the Hanoi delta . But where would this lead in the coming seventh year of the war ? <P> Straws in the wind : 1 ) local tribesmen are supplying the French with more information about Communist movements than ever before ; 2 ) the native Viet Nam soldiers are coming into their own . French officers , once hostile to their small , thin allies , now speak enthusiastically of the Viet Nam soldiers , report them gaining in strength and spirit . Last week , in an isolated post 30 miles south of Hanoi , a small Viet Nam unit fought off Communist attacks until relieved by a column of their own armor and infantry . The tough little Viet Nam soldiers evacuated their wounded , rebuilt their fortifications , put in a new garrison , and waited for the Communists to attack again . <P> If , in the seventh year of fighting , the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was hope for Indo-China .
