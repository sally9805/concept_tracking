Up to 1947 , the prisoners pent behind the grim stone walls of the old prison in the little Normandy town of Pont-l'Evque were an unimaginative crew-mostly drunks , chicken thieves , wife-beaters and petty racketeers-and their prison life was as dreary as their crimes . Then , on a certain hot afternoon in July , a new warden took over . Pert as a pouter pigeon , rotund little Fernand Billa was a jailer less interested in penology than in poetry and strong pastis ( a variant of absinthe ) . With plenty of verses and good drink to hand , Billa could find even a prison wilderness paradise enow . <P> On his very first rounds of Pont-l'Evque prison , Warden Billa found a kindred spirit in Ren Grainville , a forger and car thief . " You know , " Ren told him , " I 'm only here because of wild oats sown in my youth . I 'm really a poet , and I 've written several novels . " Billa was fascinated . " You , " Billa said at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The Special Cases . Scarcely had Grainville moved into his new post when another prisoner , a petty thief named Jean Manguy , caught the warden 's ear with some choice views on Baudelaire , Proust and Dramatist Henry Bernstein . " Ah , " said Warden Billa , " I appoint you my private secretary . " <P> From then on , life within the walls of Pont-l'Evque underwent a subtle change . With Convicts Grainville and Manguy in virtually complete charge , the new chief warden found plenty of time to enjoy his poetry and his pastis . The prisoners got keys to their cells and were permitted to move about at will . Unexplained guests came and went . Rude prison fare was augmented with Epicurean delicacies . Many prison inmates began to take their breakfast in bed , and often , at the dinner hour , they wandered out for an apritif in the village cafs . A crude guard who protested such goings-on was sternly reprimanded by Warden Billa . " These men , " said the warden , " are intellectuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the prisoners returned kindness for kindness . One night , when two prisoners found Billa lying drunk on the sidewalk , they thoughtfully loaded him into a wheelbarrow and trundled him back to jail . <P> Only Words . Like all good things , however , the happy life at Pont-l'Evque was eventually soured by those who took too great advantage of it . The principal serpent in Warden Billa 's paradise was an ardent , free-lancing lover who sent so many uncensored love letters that authorities took notice . An investigation followed , and the carefree warden was arrested along with eight of his prisoners .
