Georgia is a proud and fiery republic on the Black Sea , abutting on Armenia and Turkey , where Asia and Europe meet . A mountain-girt southland , incorporated in the Soviet Union in 1921 , and still resentful of it , Georgia gave Communism two of its mightiest sons : Joseph Djugashvili <P> Stalin and Lavrenty Beria . Last week Police Chief Beria , the home-town boy , was back in Tiflis ( pop . 520,000 ) , capital of Georgia , to undo a purge that rivaled the bizarre fantasy of the Soviet doctors . <P> Things began going sour in Georgia-so far as the rest of the world was told-in the fall of 1951 . Hundreds , perhaps thousands , of minor Red flunkeys were sent to the wall , but instead of getting better , the mess got worse . Tiflis newspapers exposed such " grave economic crimes " as " embezzlement of socialist property , " " windows and doors that have fallen to pieces , " " bedbugs breeding in our hotels . " Then Pravda joined in with a story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party cadres ; it charged last June that Georgia 's Communist leaders did not know the names of the Marx and Lenin classics , never read the papers , and could not name a single book by a Soviet author . <P> In Stalin 's Manner . All this looked suspiciously like a groundswell of Georgian nationalism , protesting Great Russian oppression . And as usual in such cases , the punishment was purge-this time " in Stalin 's manner , " as Radio Tiflis neatly put it . Nearly every ranking Communist in the Georgian Soviet lost his job for fostering " bourgeois nationalism , " including three top officials-Baramiya , Zodelava and Rapava . The Politburocrat responsible for Georgian affairs was obviously in trouble . He was Lavrenty Beria , and in proof of his displeasure , Stalin forced the police chief personally to lead the purge of the very Georgian leaders whom he himself had appointed . Now , having outlived his old master , Beria was having his revenge . <P> He began last week with a startling announcement that last year 's Georgian purge , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude violation of Soviet law . " <P> The victims ( Beria 's proteges ) were " innocent workers " falsely accused by " adventurists " who " cooked up repulsive materials ... to do harm to the Communist Party . " The chief adventurist was one I. A. Rukhadze , former Minister of Georgian State Security , and , according to Radio Tiflis , " an enemy of the people . . . with inimical careerist interests . " " By all kinds of intrigues , " the announcement went on , Rukhadze " tried to arouse a feeling of national enmity " between Georgians and Great Russians . He was aided by A. I. Mgeladze , boss of the Georgian Communist Party , and Premier Z. Ketskhoveli-the men whom Stalin promoted only last year to replace the purgees . " They have all been arrested , " said Radio Tiflis , " and will bear severe punishment . "
