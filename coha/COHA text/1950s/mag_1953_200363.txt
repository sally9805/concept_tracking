A STILLNESS AT APPOMATTOX ( 438 pp. ) - Bruce Callon-Doubleday ( $5 ) . <P> <P> Bruce Catton is a journalist ( the Nation ) who has spent three years making the Civil War sound as fresh and exciting as if it had been fought yesterday . In A Stillness at Appomattox , he ends the story of the Army of the Potomac that he began with Mr. Lincoln 's Army and continued with Glory Road . Once again , without stinting the strategies of the generals , he digs into regimental histories and private diaries to create a lively sense of the common soldier performing his uncommon chore of fighting and dying . <P> It was the privates who dubbed the Army of the Potomac " Grant 's army " after the day in March 1864 when the man with the bristly red beard and black sugarloaf hat came to visit the army 's nominal commander , Meade . Grant was something of a mystery to this army . His breakfast was a cucumber sliced in vinegar and a cup of coffee ; if he ate meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never started the daily round without two dozen cigars stowed in his pockets . <P> Hard-Bitten Veterans . The Army of the Potomac was less of a mystery to Grant . He knew that a handful of bumbling leaders-from McDowell to Hooker - had given it a galloping inferiority complex about Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia . By 1864 , not only morale but men were ebbing away as their enlistments came to an end . Yet Grant pinned his faith on hard-bitten veterans like the soldier who said : " They use a man here just the same as they do a turkey at a shooting match , fire at it all day and if they do n't kill it raffle it off in the evening ; so with us , if they ca n't kill you in three years they want you for three more-but I will stay . " <P> Once in overall command , Grant fleshed out this backbone of veterans with raw recruits , revamped whole regiments , brigades and corps , and then shoved the Army of the Potomac across the Rapidan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Richmond was a series of bloody detours . Never out of contact for more than a few hours in eleven months , Grant 's men and Lee 's men took bloody swipes at each other in the Wilderness , at Bloody Angle , Spotsylvania Court House , Cold Harbor and the Crater . On the Union side , each of these actions was well conceived but rawly executed . <P> One of the North 's best chances was lost at the battle of the Crater , outside Petersburg , the last defense post for Richmond . A bright young colonel on General Burnside 's staff thought up the idea of digging a 500-ft. tunnel under the Confederates key redoubt , blowing it up and running a ground attack through the breach . The tunnel was dug , 320 kegs of powder were planted , and after a misfiring fuse was relit , the earth flew up , as one soldier wrote , like " a waterspout as seen at sea . " A gap 500 yards wide opened in the Confederate line . The attackers rushed forward-only to bog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederates began lobbing mortar shells , and within a short time , close to one-third of the attackers were wiped out .
