txt President Eisenhower affixed his signature yesterday to the bill recently passed by Congress which frees the Treasury in one particular area of debt management from the stifling effects of arbitrary and anachronistic interest rate " ceilings " that are totally unrelated to today 's conditions in the money market . This is the measure authorizing the Treasury to increase the interest yield on " E " and " H " savings held to maturity from the rate of roughly 31/4 per cent established in 1957 to 33/4 per cent , or by one-half of 1 per cent . This is a thoroughly healthy and much needed piece of legislation , both from the standpoint of the holders of savings bonds and from that of the Treasury . Unfortunately , however , for those members of Congress who are still on a sitdown strike against the President 's request for a general modification or elimination of the idea of " ceilings " on Treasury interest rates , they have by this partial concession hopelessly compromised what purports to be the principle on which their whole case is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forced up by the policies of the Federal Reserve , which has refused to make credit available in unlimited amounts at a time when the country is moving from a state of recovery to one of boom prosperity . They have insisted on the maintenance of interest rate ceilings on Government securities despite the Government 's contention that unless interest rates were permitted to rise to the level necessary to meet the realities of the market we faced the possibility of a breakdown of the savings bond program and the crippling of the Treasury to a critical degree by shutting off the market for long-term securities at a time when it faces the already formidable task of refinancing $78 billion in outstanding debt and raising an additional $7 billion in " new money " in the months immediately ahead . The principle involved in the case of the Treasury 's ceiling of 41/4 per cent . in marketable securities and its ceiling of 31/4 , per cent on savings bonds was identical . The necessity of permitting rates to rise to competitive levels was ignored on the ground that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal debt . But that principle became a luxury the cheap money farces could n't afford when it meant antagonizing 40,000,000 holders of savings bonds . Faced with this dilemma they decided to permit an increase of one-half of 1 per cent on the rate on the $42 billion " E " and " H " bonds ( involving a cost of $210 million ) while sticking to their " principle " with respect to marketable bonds with maturities of five years or more . There are $14.6 billion securities outstanding with maturities in the range of five to ten years and $33 billion of upward of ten years . The additional cost of a one-half per cent increase in ceilings on the long bonds alone would be $165 million and on the intermediate and long maturities combined would come to $238 million .
