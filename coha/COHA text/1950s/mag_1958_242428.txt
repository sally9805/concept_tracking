In the Romagna region around Bologna , no man was a more generous lender and spender than Giambattista Giuffr . To thousands of citizens , he was the selfless benefactor whose savings he increased and whose towns he rebuilt . To the Roman Catholic priests and friars whose works he aided , Giuffr was , in the words of Monsignor Antonio Bergamaschi , Bishop of Montefeltro , " a generous soul open to any welfare initiative . " The Vatican made Giuffre a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre , and the President of Italy honored him with the title of Commendatore . About the good works-the monasteries and Catholic Action centers , the reading rooms , town halls and houses-made possible by Giuffr 's money , there was no question . But there was one question that so begged an answer that last week all Italy was asking it : Where did all the money come from ? <P> 100% Interest . The son of a carabiniere sergeant , Giambattista Giuffr , now a bald , bouncy 56 , began as a bank clerk and simple family man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , buxom Rina Bianchini , setting up her cuckolded husband in the haberdashery business . Two years ago , when the husband killed himself , Giuffr married Rina . During the years he lived in sin with her , Giuffr served as lay administrator of several Franciscan monasteries . At World War II 's end , when money began to flow in Italy again , Bank Clerk Giuffr set out to go the banks one better . He attracted the bank 's regular customers by offering to pay them 25% to 30% annual interest on loans to him . His good reputation-and the fact that Giuffr 's bank paid only 12%-brought in the clients . In 1949 Giuffr resigned from the bank , began offering up to 100% interest . <P> " Give me your money , " he told the thrifty Romagna peasants , " and I 'll double it for you in a year . " Giuffr always repaid the loans and interest promptly . Catholic charities invested large sums with him . And all the while , Giuffr gave unstintingly to the church and its works . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the monastery of the Passionist Fathers at Cesta di Copparo , the Passionists had a new monastery , 20 new acres of farm land and an $850,000 Sanctuary to the Blessed Virgin of Peace . <P> " Bankers Anonymous . " For more than a decade , Giuffr operated informally and personally , issuing only mimeographed notes as receipts to investors . His enterprise had no legal existence , was known simply by the title of " Bankers Anonymous . " ( In the Italian business vocabulary , " anonymous " means " unincorporated " . ) Two winters ago , Giuffr formed a limited company called ACOFI to engage in " industrial and commercial activities ... to bring about a new social order in Italy firmly based on the teachings of the church . " Among his partners : Dr. Enrico Vinci , president of Italy 's National Catholic Action Youth Movement and the Catholic Action 's regional vice president in Romagna.
