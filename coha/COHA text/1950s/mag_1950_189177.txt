Of all the roughriding industrialists whose energy and daring have made Sao Paulo one of the world 's fastest-growing cities , by far the most untrammeled is Francisco ( " Baby " ) Pignatari . At 33 , Baby has already built an industrial empire worth some $25 million . In his spare time he has enjoyed life with a free-spending gusto that has won him the undisputed title of Brazil 's champion playboy . <P> Almost nightly , when Baby is in Sao Paulo , his Cadillac pulls up outside a plush nightclub known as the Oasis . The Oasis ' bartender keeps a special highball glass ready with " Baby " etched on the side . There , not long ago , Baby used a whisky bottle to etch some less formal inscriptions on an uncooperative trombonist 's brow . <P> Whistle at the Door . After one Oasis evening .

Soon Baby was making the army 's machine guns , buying copper and bauxite mines , opening retail stores to sell the pots &; pans his factories made . When friends brought him their planes to repair , he began building light aircraft . <P> Experts in the Shop . By 1948 , Baby was badly overexpanded . He hired U.S. experts from Westinghouse International to modernize his setup . They found that Baby had never had his books audited ; he had simply poured his surplus into likely new enterprises , taking out his expenses as needed .
