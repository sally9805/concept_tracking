Sculptor Richard O'Hanlon is a tall , easygoing San Franciscan of 46 who knows how to turn a neat artistic trick . <P> He uses two of nature 's opposites-weather-worn rocks and feathery birds-as the means and end of his pleasantly lifelike modern sculpture . In Manhattan last week , 16 of Sculptor O'Hanlon 's rock birds were on display for his first one-man show in the East . <P> O'Hanlon 's subjects range from a dipping , dabbing Ouzel to a mournful Solemn Heron and a whole series of popeyed , studious-looking little owls . His materials are chunks of volcanic rock found in California 's hills . He chisels a bosomy pouter pigeon from pitted grey pumice , uses polished quartzite for the silken feathers of a nesting woodcock , letting the shape of the stone suggest his forms . He chisels a fierce eagle , coldly eying the world , with a few simple curves ; in his owls , a rough triangle of stone becomes a beak , a sharp shelf of rock becomes a wing jutting from a rounded body . Says O'Hanlon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds particularly-I 'm interested in all nature . I 've just chosen the bird as a symbol . I 'm really concerned with form , and birds offer wonderful plastic possibilities . " Brought up in a remote part of the Sierra Madre foothills , O'Hanlon could hardly help being interested in nature . <P> As a child , he found playmates among the skunks , rabbits , birds and snakes near his house . Later he traveled to Los Angeles ' famed La Brea tar pits to help the paleontologists dig up prehistoric fossils . <P> " I used to do that the way other kids played baseball , " says O'Hanlon . He drew people , animals and birds in oils and watercolors , made prints and clay models . <P> In 1933 , he turned to sculpture and he has been at it ever since . <P> Now an assistant professor of sculpture at the University of California , O'Hanlon has a solid reputation in the West . He sells his work for up to $2,000 , won first prize at the 1950 San Francisco Art Association annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan 's have given him a nod . His gentle little birds may not be great art , but they have the kind of rare , warm originality the average gallerygoer admires and wants to put on his mantelpiece .
