General Webb had a simply magnificent idea for getting ground forces into the enemy 's territory despite rockets and missiles and things like that . It was a grand scheme , except for one MINOR DETAIL By JACK SHARKEY The Secretary of Defense , flown in by special plane from the new Capitol Building in Denver , trotted down the ramp with his right hand outstretched before him . At the base of the ramp his hand was touched , clutched and hidden by the right hand of General " Smiley " Webb in a hearty parody of a casual handshake . General Webb did everything in a big way , and that included even little things like handshakes . Retrieving his hand once more , James Whitlow , the Secretary of Defense , smiled nervously with his tiny mouth , and said , " Well , here I am . " This statement was taken down by a hovering circle of news reporters , dispatched by wireless and telephone to every town in the forty-nine states , expanded , contracted , quoted and misquoted , ignored and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of hours . The nation , hearing it , put aside its wonted trepidations , took an extra tranquilizer or two , and felt secure once more . The government was in good hands . * * * * * Leaving the reporters in a disgruntled group beyond the **29;1479;TOOLONG barriers surrounding Project W , General Webb , seated beside Whitlow in the back of his private car , sighed and folded his arms . " You 'll be amazed ! " he chortled , nudging his companion with a bony elbow . " I  --  I expect so , " said Whitlow , clinging to his brief case with both hands . It contained , among other things , a volume of mystery stories and a ham sandwich , neatly packaged in aluminum foil . Whitlow did n't want to chance losing it . Not , at least , until he 'd eaten the sandwich . " Of course , you 're wondering where I got the idea for my project , " said " Smiley " Webb , adding , for the benefit of his driver , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAC barracks will still be there when you get off duty ! " " Yes , sir , " came a hollow grunt from the front seat . " Were n't you ? " asked General Webb , gleaming a toothy smile in Whitlow 's direction . " Were n't I what ? " Whitlow asked miserably , having lost the thread of their conversation due to a surreptitious glance backward at the WAC barracks in their wake . " Wondering about the project ! " snapped the general . " Yes . We all were , " said the Secretary of Defense , appending somewhat tartly , " That 's why they sent me here . " " To be sure . To be sure , " General Webb muttered . He did n't much like tartness in responses , but the Secretary of Defense , unfortunately , was hardly a subordinate , and therefore not subject to the general 's choler . Silly little ass ! he said to himself . Rather liking the sound of the words  --  albeit in his mind  --  he repeated them over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " squirrel-eyed . " After three or four such thoughts , the general felt much better . " I thought the whole thing up , myself , " he said , proudly . " I wish you 'd stop being so ambiguous , " Whitlow protested in a small voice . " Just what is this project ? How does it work ? Will it help us win the war ? " " Sssh ! " said the general , jerking a quivering forefinger perpendicular before pursed lips . " Security ! " He closed one eye in a broad wink and wriggled a thumb in the direction of the driver . " He 's only cleared for Confidential material , " said the general , his tone casting aspersions on the sergeant 's patriotism , ancestry and personal hygiene . " This project is , of course , Top Secret ! " He said the words reverently , his face going all noble and brave . Whitlow half-expected him to remove his hat , but he did not . * * * * * They drove onward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large field , in the center of which Whitlow could discern the outlines of an immense bull's-eye , in front of a tall , somewhat rickety khaki-colored reviewing stand , draped in tired bunting . " What 's that ? " asked Whitlow , relinquishing his grip on his brief case long enough to point toward the field . " Ssssh ! " said " Smiley " Webb . " You 'll find out in a matter of hours . " " Many hours ? " Whitlow asked , thinking of the ham sandwich . General Webb consulted a magnificent platinum timepiece anchored to his thick hairy wrist by a stout leather strap . " In exactly one hour , thirty-seven minutes , and **28;1510;TOOLONG seconds ! " he said , proudly . " Thank you , " Whitlow sighed . " You 're certainly running this thing  --  whatever it is  --  in an efficient manner . " " Thank you ! " General Webb glowed . " We like to think so , " he added modestly . * * * * * Passwords , signs , countersigns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until Whitlow was despairing of ever getting into the heart of Project W. He said as much to General Webb , who merely flashed the grin which gave him his nickname , and opened a final door . For a moment , Whitlow thought he was going deaf . The shrill roar of screeching metal and throbbing dynamos that pounded at his eardrums began to fuddle his mind , until General Webb handed him a small cardboard box  --  also stamped , like every door and wall in the place , " Top Secret "  --  in which his trembling fingers located two ordinary rubber earplugs , which he instantly put to good use . " There she is ! " said General Webb , proudly , gesturing over the railing of the small balcony upon which they stood . " The Whirligig ! " " What ? " called Secretary of Defense Whitlow , shaking his head to indicate he had n't heard a word . Somewhat piqued , but resigned , General Webb leaned his wide mouth nearly up against Whitlow 's small pink plugged ear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whitlow , a little stunned by the volume despite the plugs , nodded wearily , to indicate that he 'd heard , then asked , in a high , piping voice , " What 's it for ? " Webb 's eyes bulged in their sockets . " Great heavens , man , ca n't you see ? " He gestured down at his creation , his baby , his project , as though it were self-evident what its function was . Whitlow strained his eyes to divine anything that might give a clue as to just what the government had been pouring money into for the past eight months . All he saw was what appeared to be a sort of ferris-wheel , except that it was revolving in a horizontal plane . The structure was completely enclosed in metal , and was whirling too fast for even the central shaft to be anything but a hazy , silver-blue blur . " I see it , " he shouted , squeakily . " But I do n't understand it ! " " Come with me , " said General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just about to step through when , with a quick blush of mortification , he remembered the " Top Secret " earplugs . Hastily , averting his face lest the other man see his embarrassment , he returned his plugs to their box , and did the same with Whitlow 's . Whitlow was glad when the door closed behind them . " My office is this way , " said Webb , striding off in a stiff military manner . Whitlow , with a forlorn shrug , could do nothing but clutch his brief case and follow . * * * * * " It 's this way , " General Webb began , once they were seated uncomfortably in his office . From a pocket in his khaki jacket , Webb had produced a big-bowled calabash pipe , and was puffing its noxious gray fumes in all directions while he spoke . " Up until the late fifties , war was a simple thing ... " Oh , not the March of Science Speech ! said Whitlow to himself . He knew it by heart . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military strategists . As the general 's voice droned on and on , Whitlow barely listened . The general , Top Secret or no Top Secret , was divulging nothing that was n't common knowledge from the ruins of Philadelphia to the great Hollywood crater ... All at once , weapons had gotten too good . That was the whole problem . Wars , no matter what the abilities of the death-dealing guns , cannon , rifles , rockets or whatever , needed one thing on the battlefield that could not be turned out in a factory : Men . In order to win a war , a country must be vanquished . In order to vanquish a country , soldiers must be landed . And that was precisely wherein the difficulty lay : landing the soldiers . Ships were nearly obsolete in this respect . Landing barges could be blown out of the water as fast as they were let down into it . Paratroops were likewise hopeless . The slow-moving troop-carrying planes dare n't even peek above the enemy 's horizon without chancing an onslaught of " thinking " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molten cinders falling into the sea . So someone invented the supersonic carrier . This was pretty good , allowing the planes to come in high and fast over the enemy 's territory , as fast as the land-to-air missiles themselves . The only drawback was that the first men to try parachuting at that speed were battered to confetti by the slipstream of their own carriers . That would not do . Next , someone thought of the capsules . Each man was packed into a break-proof , shock-proof , water-proof , wind-proof plastic capsule , and ejected safely beyond the slipstream area of the carriers , at which point , each capsule sprouted a silken chute that lowered the enclosed men gently down into range of the enemy 's rocket-fire ... This plan was scrapped like the others . And so , things were at a stalemate . There had n't been a really good skirmish for nearly five years . War was hardly anything but a memory , what with both sides practically omnipotent . Unless troops could be landed , war was downright impossible . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . As a matter of fact , Whitlow liked the state of affairs . To be Secretary of Defense during a years-long peace was a soft job to top all soft jobs . And Whitlow did n't much like war . He 'd rather live peacefully with his mystery stories and ham sandwiches . But the Capitol , under the relentless lobbying of the munitions interests , was trying to find a way to get a war started . They had tried simply bombing the other countries , but it had n't worked out too well : the other countries had bombed back . This plan had been scrapped as too dangerous . And then , just when all seemed lost , when it looked as though mankind was doomed to eternal peace ... Along came General " Smiley " Webb . " Land troops ? " he 'd said , confidently , " nothing easier . With the government 's cooperation , I can have our troops in any country in the world , safely landed , within the space of one year ! " Congress had voted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at Project W. No one knew quite what it was about , but the general had seemed so self-assured that  --  Well , they 'd almost forgotten about him until some ambitious clerk , trying to balance at least part of the budget , had discovered a monthly expenditure to an obscure base in the southwest totalling some millions of dollars . Perfunctory checking had brought out the fact that " Smiley " Webb had been drawing this money every month , and had n't as much as mailed in a single progress report . There 'd been swift phone-calls from Denver to Project W , and , General Webb informed them , not only was all the money to be accounted for , but so was all the time and effort : the project was completed , and about to be tested . Would someone like to come down and watch ? Someone would . * * * * * And thus it was that James Whitlow , with mystery stories and ham sandwich , had taken the first plane from the Capitol ... " ... when all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the problem ! " said Webb , breaking in on Whitlow 's reverie . " I beg your pardon ? " said the Secretary of Defense . Webb whacked the dottle out of his pipe into a meaty palm , tossed the smoking cinders rather carelessly into a waste-basket , and leaned forward to confront the other man face to face , their noses almost nudging . " Why are parachutes out ? " he snapped . " They go too slow , " said Whitlow . " Why do we use parachutes at all ? " " To keep the men from getting killed by the fall . " " Why does a fall kill the men ? " " It  --  It breaks their bones and stuff . " " Bah ! " Webb scoffed . " Bah ? " reiterated Whitlow . " Bah ? " " Certainly bah ! " said the general . " All it takes is a little training . " * * * * * " All what takes ? " said Whitlow , helplessly . " Falling , man , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fall safely from ten feet  --  Why not from ten times ten feet ! ? " " Because , " said Whitlow , " increasing height accelerates the rate of falling , and  --  " " Poppycock ! " the general roared . " Yes , sir , " said Whitlow , somewhat cowed . " Muscle-building . That 's the secret . Endurance . Stress . Strain . Tension . " " If  --  If you say so ... " said Whitlow , slumping lower and lower in his chair as the general 's massive form leaned precariously over him . " But  --  " " Of course you are puzzled , " said the general , suddenly chummy . " Anyone would be . Until they realized the use to which I 've put the Whirligig ! " " Yes . Yes , I suppose so ... " said Whitlow , thinking longingly of his ham sandwich , and its crunchy , moist green smear of pickle relish . " The first day  --  " said General Webb , " it revolved at one gravity ! They withstood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When ? " asked Whitlow , with much confusion . " The men ! " said the general , irritably . " The men in the Whirligig ! " Whitlow jerked bolt upright . " There are men in that thing ? " It 's not possible , he thought . " Of course , " said Webb , soothingly . " But they 're all right . They 've been in there for thirty days , whirling around at one gravity more each day . We have constant telephone communication with them . They 're all feeling fine , just fine . " " But  --  " Whitlow said , weakly . General Webb had him firmly by the arm , and was leading him out of the office . " We must get to the stands , man . Operation Human Bomb in ten minutes . " " Bomb ? " Whitlow squeaked , scurrying alongside Webb as the larger man strode down the echoing corridor . " A euphemism , of course , " said Webb . " Because they will fall much like a bomb does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , rifles in hand , ready to take over the enemy territory . " " Without parachutes ? " Whitlow marveled . " Exactly , " said the general , leading the way out into the blinding desert sunlight . " You see , " he remarked , as they strolled toward the heat-shimmering outlines of the reviewing stand , its bunting hanging limp and faded in the dry , breezeless air , " it 's really so simple I 'm astonished the enemy did n't think of it first . Though , of course , I 'm glad they did n't  --  Ha ! ha ! " He oozed self-appreciation . " Ha ha , " repeated Whitlow , with little enthusiasm . " When one is whirled at one gravity , you see , the wall  --  the outside rim  --  of the Whirligig , becomes the floor for the men inside . Each day , they have spent up to ten hours doing nothing but deep knee-bends , and eating high protein foods . Their legs will be able to withstand any force of landing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , of course , each of them weighed nearly three tons  --  they can jump from any height and survive . Good , huh ? " * * * * * Whitlow was worried as they clambered up into the stands . There seemed to be no one about but the two of them . " Who else is coming ? " he asked . " Just us , " said Webb . " I 'm the only one with a clearance high enough to watch this . You 're only here because you 're my guest . " " But  --  " said Whitlow , observing the heat-baked wide-open spaces extending on all sides of the reviewing stand and bull's-eye , " the men on this base can surely watch from almost anywhere not beyond the horizon . " " They 'd better not ! " was the general 's only comment . " Well , " said Whitlow , " what happens now ? " " The men that were in that Whirligig have  --  since you and I went to my office to chat  --  been transported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloft  --  " he consulted his watch , " five minutes , and fifty-five-point-six seconds ago . " " And ? " asked Whitlow , casually unbuckling the straps of his brief case and slipping out his sandwich . " The plane will be within bomb vector of this target in just ten seconds ! " said Webb , confidently . Whitlow listened , for the next nine seconds , then , right on schedule , he heard the muted droning of a plane , high up . Webb joggled him with an elbow . " They 'll fall faster than any known enemy weapon can track them , " he said , smugly . " That 's fortunate , " said Whitlow , munching desultorily at his sandwich . " Bud dere 's wud thig budduhs bee . " " Hmmf ? " asked the general . Whitlow swallowed hastily . " I say , there 's one thing bothers me . " " What 's that ? " asked the general . " Well , it 's just that gravity is centripetal , you know , and the Whirligig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of difference ? " " Bah ! " said General Webb . " Just a minor detail . " " If you say so , " Whitlow shrugged . " There they come ! " shouted the general , jumping to his feet . Whitlow , despite his misgivings , found that he , too , was on his feet , staring skyward at the tiny dots that were detaching themselves from the shining bulk of the carrier plane . As he watched , his heart beating madly , the dots grew bigger , and soon , awfully soon , they could be distinguished as man-shaped , too . " There 's  --  There 's something wrong ! " said the general . " What 's that they 're all shouting ? It should be ' Geronimo ' ... " Whitlow listened . " It sounds more like ' Eeeeeyaaaaa ' , " he said . And it was . The sound grew from a distant mumble to a shrieking roar , and the next thing , each man had landed upon the concrete-and-paint bull's-eye before the reviewing stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general moaned and fainted . And the men of the Whirligig , all of whom had landed on the target head-first , did nothing , their magnificently muscled legs waving idly in a sudden gentle gust of desert breeze . THE END
