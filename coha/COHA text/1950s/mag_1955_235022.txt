Dr. Sydney W. Britton of the University of Virginia kept chimpanzees around the house . He treated them well and grew quite fond of them . His object : to learn from the chimps why their distant human cousins have big brains and walk on their hind legs . Last week , at a meeting of the National Society for Medical Research in San Francisco , he told his theory : <P> The Britton chimps normally walked on all fours , standing upright only when excited or when they wanted to look around . But they could be made to stand upright for as much as eight hours by being put on a tilting table . The erect posture caused a greater flow of blood to the brain . Dr. Britton believes that when man 's apelike , allfours ancestors started to walk on their hind legs , their brains grew bigger . <P> What started the ape men walking on their hind legs ? Dr. Britton installed a female chimp named Bonga on a small island in a lake at Charlottesville , Va . Bonga could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though the Virginia winter soon brought snow . When there was snow on the ground , Bonga walked upright , apparently to keep her hands and belly from getting cold and wet . <P> This thinks Dr. Britton , may be how it all started . When glaciers crept down a million years ago , chilling the climate , the ape men walked upright to keep their hands out of the snow . Their brains got more blood and grew bigger . Then the ape men , according to the Britton theory , started the long intellectual climb that turned them into men .
