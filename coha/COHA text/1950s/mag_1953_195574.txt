Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt was asked to compare Native Dancer with " the other good horses " he has owned . Vanderbilt answered briefly , with an all-sufficient distinction : " Native Dancer is the first great horse I 've ever owned . " Most of the 40,000 racing fans at Jamaica Race Track one day last week shared Owner Vanderbilt 's conviction . Coupled with his stablemate , Social Outcast , the unbeaten Dancer was a 1-10 favorite to win the $100,000 Wood Memorial at a mile and an eighth , the longest race he had ever been called upon to run . <P> Following what has now become almost standard procedure , Jockey Eric Guerin held the big ( 16 hands , 1,120 Ibs. ) grey just off the pace set by Tahitian King , runner-up to the Dancer in last season 's Belmont Futurity . A length apart they ran , for most of the race , the Dancer trailing on the outside , with other potential Kentucky Derby entrants stretched out behind . At the top of the homestretch , Jockey Guerin eased up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one stimulating whack of the whip , Native Dancer went under the wire an easy 4 lengths in front . The time : 1:50 , not sensationally fast , but as usual , fast enough . <P> During the winter , horsemen engaged in lively argument as to whether Native Dancer could spread his speed over a distance ; there is more sprint than stay in his bloodlines . But the Dancer 's performance in the mile-and-an-eighth Wood satisfied a good many doubters . Said his trainer , Bill Winfrey , no doubter : " He looks as if he could run all day . " <P> The chief remaining question , as the Dancer was shipped to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby this week , seemed to be whether any three-year-old in sight can beat him . At week 's end , track fans singled out one sturdy possibility : a California-bred colt named Correspondent , which has never run against Native Dancer before . In his own final prep for the Derby last week , Correspondent romped home five lengths ahead to win the mile-and-an-eighth Blue Grass Stakes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Correspondent ran the distance in 1:49 , a fifth of a second faster than the track record held by Calumet Farm 's famed Coaltown . <P> <P> Correspondent 's flashy victory impressed the Agua Caliente bookmakers enough to knock his odds down to 2-1 in the Derby . Even so , Native Dancer , now rated at even money , may be an odds-on favorite by Derby post time .
