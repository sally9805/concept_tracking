A Dartmouth teacher asks what oaths may the free conscience permit by Alexander Laing I N THE SUMMER of 1949 , when most teachers were n't looking , the New Hampshire Legislature passed a teacher 's oath law . It has been enforced , so far , only in state-financed schools . The other day a student asked me what I would do if the courts should find the vaguely phrased Hart Act applicable to the private place of learning for which I work . I said that I could not , in good conscience , take this particular oath , and tried to explain why . When he had gone , I recalled the occasion when I had taken a voter 's oath in my state of residence , Vermont . Why had that not been objectionable ? Had we all been more naive about oaths , in the old days ? I tried to recall it , and it was shocking to have to admit that I had not the dimmest glimmer of memory of what I had sworn to do or not to do --  -- on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Citizen to recall bits of conversation from years ago . What would become of me if I should ever have to face up to the choice of contempt , for a blank memory , or perjury , for a faulty one , upon some such matter ? The general circumstances of that act of oath-taking were very vivid . I tried to review them in memory , with a . hope of recapturing the words of the obligation , or at least their sense . Town Meeting for 1939 was coming up . The Town Clerk 's wife had verified my check-list entry . She told me to see her husband , over in the school house , about the oath . My wife and I walked across the patchy snow to the school , where a belated teacher said we should find the Town Clerk upstairs . I asked if he was busy . " Yes , " she said , " But you can go right up . " Dust , and a swishing , bumping noise came from one of the rooms . We found the Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused , leaning on his brush handle , and seemed to smile with his eyes . Feeling like one who had caught the bank president shaking the furnace , I asked ift it was too late for me to take the Freeman 's Oath . He shook his head , and balanced his brush against a blackboard , and hitched his galluses . " You should n't have to go back to your office , now , " my wife objected . " Ca n't we meet you there a little later ? ' ' He said he was figuring to do it right where he stood . Adding inches to his height as he squared his old shoulders , he told us to raise our right hands . I pointed out that my wife was still an alien . He seemed disconcerted , as if I had insulted her in his hearing . I added that she was British . He looked relieved . " Almost the same as us , " he said , " but she 'll have to get her papers first . Ready ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now you can go ahead and vote , " he announced benevolently , and picked up his janitor 's brush with an air . It was as if the Lord God Jehovah had noticed that the golden streets needed a touch of tidying ? and knew that if a thing was to be done well , he had better do it himself . That was the dark spring after Munich . Spain had just fallen to the Fascists . Yet as we walked down the noisy stairs , I felt a strong good sense of exhilaration , a growing hunch that democracy was going to pull through at the last , somehow . But the central words the Town Clerk had spoken still eluded me . I had to look them up : You solemnly swear that whenever you give your vote or suffrage , touching any matter that concerns the state of Vermont , you will do it so as in your conscience you shall judge will most conduce to the best good of the same , as established by the Constitution , without fear or favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those words , but the reasons are evident . There was and there is nothing objectionable to me in the Freeman 's Oath . Meriting its name , it slipped wholly welcome into my mind . Yet its expression has a gnarled integrity , like the roots of a sugar bush gripping to the rock for best advantage , but not for elegance . The memory-haunting precision of some other noble statements is not here . As I. read it again , I saw that the pivotal word " conscience " made the great difference . What then is wrong with the Hart Act 's oath ? It begins with an affirmation of allegiance , such as only a pacificist or a genuine subversive would be likely to find objectionable ? and the latter would take care not to object . But the second part requires me to swear : that I do not advocate , nor am I a member of any political party or organization that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of this state by force or violence ; and that during such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution in New Hampshire , I will not advocate nor become a member of any political party or organization- which advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of this state , by force or violence . Do I so advocate ? Not at present , but in the future I might find that this oath had frustrated my freedom of conscience to act at the best hour in the cause of good government . What if some authoritarian group should be voted into power by a deluded citizenry ? That is how the change came , quite legally at first , in some other countries . The Hart Act oath would have constrained me in advance not to advocate the forceful overthrow of that authoritarian , though legally elected , government . FANTASTIC example ? Anyone who doubts the speed of such processes needs to be reminded that in seven years ways have been devised of evading , and even of reversing , two firm and ancient absolutes that men who called themselves patriots fought revolutions to establish : ( a ) That every person is presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person 's accusers are not to be credited unless they will confront him . Yet the single legislator who has done most to obtain a general public acquiescence in these changes was emphatically reelected . If the people are satisfied with these two surrenders of democratic to totalitarian principle , it well may be that there is a real and present " danger that subversives of the Right or Left may attain power in office to suppress all the tolerances of democracy that permitted them to gain their backing . A time then would come when the totalitarian usurpers could be dislodged only by " force and violence , " since the other means would have been usurped or suppressed . Well , when that happens , the advocates of oath laws assure me , all bets are off anyhow . But just when does it happen ? Not at any sure moment , if the history of Italy , Germany , Argentina or Czechoslovakia has any meaning . Totalitarianism typically offers a practical formula to solve an urgent immediate difficulty for a majority of voters . It becomes entrenched precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , we must overlook these harsh methods for the sake of the main objective . And as the piecemeal surrenders continue , at just what point , as government is being subverted from within , shall the teacher forswear his foolish oath ? Note that the oath stipulates " the government , " which means any government . It does not say , " the constitutional form of government , " which would be a very different obligation . What good is an oath which , as its own advocates admit , might in high duty have to be forsworn at some discretionary , future time ? Its surest tendency would be the evil one of delaying revolt , in the more conscientious individuals , until revolt would be hopeless ? as our Secretary of State has admitted that it now is behind the Iron Curtain . Anyone who regards this as an absurd test should . at least be reminded that reduction to absurdity is ? a common device by which teachers demonstrate the essential fallacy of a proposal . There is , in the Hart Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath requires the teacher to " support and defend " the constitution of his state . This constitution contains a section headed " Right of Revolution , " siihich reveals that the wise men who drafted it in 1792 foresaw the precise possibility discussed above . They reserved forever to the people the right to change their government by force if it should be corrupted . Yet the second part of the Hart Act oath compels the teacher not to advocate what the first part requires him to support and defend ! Admirers of the Hart Act have explained to me that it is absurd for an organ of government to cherish the means of its own destruction , and that consequently the " right of revolution " clauses in this and several other state constitutions have always been void . It seems an offhand way of nullifying the basic law . If one group of citizens can call a " particular , far-sighted constitutional provision void because absurd , when it obstructs their particular project , why should not another group use the same argument upon a lesser and recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath that produces the absurd conflict ? Many provisions have been imbedded in constitutions precisely because , in times of stress , the temporary rea -- sons for abandoning first principles do become temptingly expedient . Article 10 of the New Hampshire Constitution , which protects the right of revolution found an expedient positive application , after 141 years , when the state 's Supreme Court cited it in a labor case . It appears to have been conveniently valid then , in 1933 . I find no evidence of a reversal since that year , to make it conveniently invalid now , for the lawmakers . Our problem here is more with the minds of teachers , and with distinctions which seem to make it difficult for legislators to comprehend the teacher 's problem . Legalists seem to forget , for example , that in the task of applying the principles of the law , the legal mind is doing its best half of the time to establish something that is not so , and that sometimes it succeeds . We all should be grateful for this worthy oddity of the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to assure justice to both winner and loser . But it is very different from the task of the teacher , whose mind , by dedication and specific training , must all of the time seek to establish what is so : the truth . If We expect him to do that , his mind has a special claim to be free of all arbitrary restraint . There is a risk , in this freedom , as there is in all great causes . But can it be argued that the risk of putting children under the control of free minds has any resemblance , in the count of ruined lives , to the risk of letting them learn to use our motor cars ? The above abstract discussion deals with some deep roots of intellectual honesty ? matters of the highest concern to teachers who value their integrity . There are practical , more obvious reasons as well for doubting that the interests of our youth . can be well served by legislative investigations and teachers ' oaths . For example , Article 1 of the Hart Act says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine . . . in any . . . state approved school . " What is advocacy ? What is Communism ? Lawyers expect judges to interpret these legislative phrases . In the meanwhile the teacher , as always , has to define his own terms . If he is unsure of what judge and jury might think , except that they probably would not think exactly as he does , he may be so cautious as to injure the basic objective of teaching the truth . Why ? Well , consider what happens when an instructor gives an examination on matters no more subtle than definitions of " advocacy " and " Communism . " He finds that most of his students have garbled somewhat the specific statements they have heard him make in his lectures . A few have almost completely misunderstood what he said . Do the legislators who think to solve a grave problem with a glib oath and an investigation ever take this situation into account ? Partial misunderstanding is the continuous , necessary state of affairs in the business of teaching , even in subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods . If all students wrote perfect examination papers , we would be warned that the pace of instruction was far too slow . Yet , when partial misunderstanding of the best efforts at clarity is every teacher 's daily experience , how can he know what will be misconstrued as advocacy by some legislator 's unsuspected nephew in the back row ? Not so long ago a colleague of mini showed some motion pictures he had taken on a South Sea atoll . He told how all the men would get together to build each individual 's house or canoe . He said that the catch of fish was equally divided among all families , even when only one man caught anything . I would have had little respect for the powers of observation of any student who failed to recognize aspects of Communism on the atoll . The professor carefully avoided the word . Was he guilty of an evasive piece of advocacy in presenting his technicolor idyll without a specific warning that these happy people were practicing Communists ? A few years ago , any teacher would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is faced by choices that are really sinister to anyone whose first duty is to serve the truth . Should this objective contribution to our knowledge of man be suppressed ? If we dare show it , should the aspects of Communism be indiCated without comment , or explained as economic necessities in a most unusual environment , or deplored , or ignored ? And ? whichever might the legislator 's nephew write home to mother ? What would the report sound like when it reached uncle ? Would uncle think the law had been broken ? If he sought to prove it , the testimony would be that of students who ? on their examination papers ? chronically demonstrate a willingness to bear earnest false witness against what teacher really said . Another instance : When Vice-President Nixon was a Representative , I once asked him at luncheon whether he approved of the assignment of the Manifesto as required reading for all seniors in a course he had just addressed . He said , ' " No . " Then he said , " Yes . " As he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that it was a proper assignment in colleges , but not in high schools . College graduates who had read the document would be better prepared to confront a world in which its influence had been enormous . I wondered afterward whether the majority of voting citizens are better off if they are ignorant of the roots of the central world issue of their lifetimes . And yet , it is a document that has enlisted the loyalty of very clever men . How can teachers know that this will not happen again to some whom they expose to it ? Of course , they can not know . They are confronted by the ancient question : ' Is ignorance preferable to knowledge , merely because there always will be some men who will seem , in the opinion of the rest , to - put knowledge to fanatical uses ? Rep. Edward J. Hart said , at a hearing on his Bill , " I do n't want you teachers to teach Communism . I do want you to teach about these termites . " It seemed a perfectly clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guidance of conscientious teachers , should be apparent from the instance I have given of life on an atoll . Because of oath laws , and the hovering specter of legislative investigations , teachers tend to evade altogether the one subject with which , most of our youth will have to deal sooner or later , perhaps in the most tragic , disastrous terms . Who then will be primarily responsible if our side confronts the ultimate contest in a generation shackled by ignorance of the nature of its opponent ? I HAVE YET to meet a teacher who quarrels with the broad objectives of anti-subversive investigations and legislation , although most regard the particular measures and procedures as unwise and unnecessary in fact . It is clear to us why parents should be worried over the one-sided situation of a mature , trained mind controlling impressionable children . But have parent and law-maker no memory of the maverick ? There is one in almost every class , wholly devoted to the opposite side of all arguments . We have also the competition , between teachers , to capture the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the cold war of the subjects . " What one teacher says is cited in another teacher 's class . Subversive indoctrination will be quickly detected by colleagties , who can be trusted to maintain their profession 's integrity . . And yet , the notion that teaching can be made a 100-percent-pure profession is as foolish as a reliance upon the 100-percent honesty of bank tellers . They likewise are selected with care , and bonded in addition . But from time to time one of them still absconds with the boodle . Would he have been deterred by an oath that he does not belong to an organization that advocates the plundering of banks ? The teacher who calls a particular oath degrading and ineffectual is not seeking to evade an obligation properly required of other public or professional employees . He is objecting to a device which at best is futile . It seems of itself to have revealed no subversives . And he notes that it has in fact produced disastrous negative effects upon the educational process , as it did at the University of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other servants of the public must do is to ignore the very special , dual nature of the teacher 's task : to find What truth is , and to convey what is true . It also misses a great distinction between kinds of oaths , centering in the one word " conscience . " Actually there are three main forms of oath in use , singly or in combination : three ways of swearing . 1 . Political . There is the simple oath of allegiance . 2 . Religious . There is the oath to be bound by conscience , before God or any other source of moral au : thority , in testifying , trying and voting . 3 . Disciplinary . There is the negative oath to refrain , under specific penalty , from specified acts of faith or of advocacy . I have found that there is a sad confusion among teachers themselves over the different moral qualities of these three separate kinds of oaths . Persons who give and consider evidence which may send a fellow human being to death have to swear only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate as an absolute and final test of all truth . Yet teachers often are required to swear that they will teach only what legislators say they may teach . The moment this happens , conscience is damaged in some measure . HoWeyer sincere the legislator may be , and even if the two are in agreement , the teacher has surrendered his function and has become a propagandist . The extent of this surrender may seem trivial to the layman . Yet , it is a cancerous , pervasive triviality . It sends tiny , blighting filaments from the one focal point in many directions . The teacher who once spoke the truth as he saw it , bluntly and directly , at all times , on all matters , now finds himself watching for the inference coming up , and wondering about misconstructions of what he has just uttered . He makes joking references to the climate of fear , when he should be deeply serious . He interjects such remarks as , " Watch that one . It might contain a subversive thought . " The tiny focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged and hovers between teacher and student . It does not take much of this to destroy the sensitive student-teacher relationship of trust , upon which all honest learning depends . Administrators have seized with relief upon one formula : they will not knowingly employ anyone whose allegiance to the party line prevents him from freely knowing and teaching the truth . But this glib objection to the Communist teacher has embarrassing corollaries : a free teacher must not be bound by any prior doctrine which limits his free objectivity in seeking and teaching the truth . Some religions , and most teacher 's oaths , do precisely that . I believe , of course , that special oaths for teachers are unnecessary . But if anyone should feel better , it would not be difficult for us to devise an oath having the moral dignity of those that are administered to witnesses , and jurors , and voters in Vermont . The following form might meet that stipulation : In all my efforts to comprehend what truth is , and to teach what is true , I shall follow only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favoring any creed , or doctrine , or person .
