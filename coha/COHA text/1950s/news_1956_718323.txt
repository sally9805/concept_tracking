txt Adlai E. Stevenson has decided that now is the time to step up attack on the Republicans and . on President xis. enhower  --  without ? quarter , all along the political front . The reasoning is twofold : 1 . The candidates are on the final lap of the campaign , and the Democrats should approach the finish line with a strong and crescendoing flourish of indictment against their opponents . 2 . If , as . some Stevenson lieutenants believe , the entry of President Eisenhower into the race has caused the Republicans to move perceptibly ahead , then the way for Mr. Stevenson to regain the lead is to conduct the kind of hard-hitting attack which some of his advisers have long been urging . Greeted by Applause Certainly the sharp charges Mr. Stevenson hurled against Mr. Eisenhower and his party during a day of campaigning in the Greater New York area  --  Manhattan , the Bronx , Queens , and Westchester  --  elicited surging cheers and tumultuous applause from large and enthusiastic audiences . They seemed to want to hear him " pour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Northwest and Midwest , including even Michigan , the reception in Greater New York was a tonic to Mr. Stevenson and his managers . In these ' addresses the Democratic challenger accused the Re publicans of conducting " a campaign of cover up .

Yet the Republicans had " sneered " at this proposal . Mr. Stevenson said ' he had sought to awaken people to the perils of . Suez and the Middle East , to the GOP record on schools , natural resources , health , and farm policy , but the Republicans had replied with a steady refrain : " Do n't believe what you hear . Just trust Ike . " In like vein he added that when the Democrats had sought to argue that Vice-President Richard M.

" It was attack , attack , all through the day . To a businessmen 's luncheon sponsored by Volunteers for Stevenson-Kefauver at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , Mr. Stevenson accused the Republicans of recoiling from " the challenge of the future . " Imagination and Ideas ' " A great task ahead for the New America , " he reasoned , " was to take full advantage of the startling technological revor lution ? the whole process of automation , the miracle of atomic power , the advances in industrial and agricultural chemistry . " He added : ? " The task is to take advantage of all this while still preserving those sources of the creativity of American life  --  the free individual making his own way in life , the family farm , the family firih , the small town , the small col lege , the small enterprise of any , sort .

" He charged that if the President 's office had exerted as much pressure on Congress for a school bill , as it exerted against the Hells Canyon federal dam proposal , the school bill would have passed this year . This was a fighting Stevenson , who did not ? as he often has done  --  soften or mute on the platform the strongest words and phrases in his prepared text .

Appeasement has once again proved neither wise nor honorable nor expedient . " ? - Army of Specialists ' " I do n't mind telling you that I am good and mad , " Mr. Stevenson told a 5,000-strong audience at the Westchester County Center in White Plains , N.Y . " Plenty of Americans are mad . They should be . The Republicans have been treating the American people like so many children who can be put to sleep with lullabies . " Mr. Stevenson said he had tried to tell the truth about the perils of hydrogen-bomb tests , and had been endorsed in his viewpoint by 270 nuclear scientists , but that President Eisenhower had called his proposal a " theatrical gesture . " He added that he had proposed less reliance on the military draft and more reliance on an army of specialists , so as to halt the " turnover of 70 per cent in three years " which the defense forces                    @
