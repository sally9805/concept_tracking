In his native England , **25;15672;TOOLONG Peter Alexander Ustinov did so little TV that one critic mourned : " Genius is going to waste . That multitalented marvel , that compendium of comedy , has no sense of his duty to mankind-especially the part that watches TV . " Luckily for viewers across the Atlantic , peripatetic Peter Ustinov is busting out all over U.S. television . <P> This season the portly ( 229 lbs. ) , shaggy droll with the twinkling squint has hurdled the gulf from Omnibus to The $64,000 Challenge , popped up on What 's My Line ? , The Last Word , and six memorable sessions of the Jack Paar Show . Last week , in his second Omnibus show , he won hosannas for directing and starring in a televersion of his own satiric tragedy , Moment of Truth , playing a Petain-like elder statesman with overtones of King Lear . <P> Wunderkind . While getting ready for his appearance this week on the Steve Allen Show , Ustinov ( pronounced Youstinov ) did a telecast for the Canadian Broadcasting Co. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N. , squeezed in three interviews , a picture sitting , a lecture , a testimonial dinner , and a spot of home life in his East Side Manhattan apartment with his wife , Canadian Actress Suzanne Cloutier , and their two children . In between , he also cavorted through eight performances of his Ustinov-written Broadway comedy , Romanoff and Juliet , which was sagging at the box office when its run was bolstered by his spectacular TV performance as Dr. Samuel Johnson ( TIME . Dec. 30 ) . <P> At 36 , Ustinov is a sort of Orson Welles rolled into one . He has 13 produced plays to his credit , two of which have reached Broadway ( the first : The Love of Four Colonels ) , has acted in dozens of plays and movies , directed half a dozen more . A brilliant raconteur , ad-libber and dialectician , he speaks French , German . Italian and Spanish ( plus devastatingly accurate American of several regions ) , gives funny , plausible imitations of languages he does not speak , e.g. , Russian with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . a bugle , a violin , flute , bassoon or harpsichord . He is halfway through the script of a novel . And he has been doing this sort of thing for half of his life . Says Ustinov : " This talk of Wunderkind gets more intense as I grow older and the white hairs crop out in my beard . "
