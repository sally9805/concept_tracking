Nearly every up &; coming laboratory now has a hot spot where radioactive material is handled with gingerly precaution . Hottest spot of this sort in any non-Government lab is the bottom of a water-filled tank at California 's Stanford Research Institute , where a rod and four nesting cylinders of radioactive cobalt glow with a weird blue light . Together they weigh only 10 Ibs. and they cost only $22,500 , but they give off as much radiation ( 4,500 curies ) as $80 million worth of radium . If their shielding water were to leak away , they would give a man a fatal dose of radiation in seven seconds . <P> The hot cobalt " source , " the most powerful yet released by the AEC , got its punch by soaking up neutrons for nearly eight months in the nuclear reactor at Brookhaven National Laboratory , Long Island . It traveled across the country in a two-ton lead container . Stanford research-men still look at their dangerous captive with some awe , but they intend to put it to practical work , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged when sterilized by heat .
