A plan to set up a new Council of Economic Advisers was sent to Congress last week by the President . The work of scholarly Economics Professor Arthur F. Burns , who will head the new council , the plan will re-establish CEA as the President 's top economic advisory group . Like the old CEA , first set up under Harry Truman 's Administration , the new three-man board will keep an eye on U.S. economic changes , advise the President on what to do about them , help him prepare his economic reports to the nation . But there the comparison ends . <P> The chairman of Eisenhower 's council will outrank the other two members , and be the only council member to sit in on presidential conferences . An " Advisory Board on Economic Growth and Stability , " composed of top members of Government departments ( e.g. , Commerce , Labor , Agriculture ) , will be set up to draw plans for combating any recession and to formulate long-range economic policy . To bridge the gap between the planners and the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ex-McGraw-Hill editor , will sit in on Advisory Board meetings . <P> Eisenhower 's beefed-up council will be operating within 60 days under Chairman Burns , but will need funds , probably $300,000 a year , to keep going . A former Columbia University economics professor , Arthur Frank Burns , 49 , is a rumpled , pipe-smoking , registered Democrat , who voted for Eisenhower because " my thinking . . . ran pretty much like the thinking of the country . " In economics , however , Burns 's thoughts follow no particular school . He firmly believes that Government should stay out of the nation 's economic affairs as much as possible , interfere only out of " hard necessity . " Burns himself knows only one way to classify economists-good or bad . " And you 'll have to decide for yourselves , " he once told his Columbia classes , " where I belong . " <P> Born in Stanislau , Austria , Burns graduated from Columbia in 1925 , took his doctorate in economics nine years later . After teaching at Rutgers and Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Economic Research in 1945 . When the old CEA ran out of operating funds three months ago , President Eisenhower picked Burns as his economic adviser , got a $50,000 appropriation for him to set up shop . <P> Congress parted with the money with great reluctance , mostly because Truman 's councilmen had made few friends on Capitol Hill . Under Truman , the three CEA members all had equal standing . Thus the council was often split and public squabbles were common . It became less of an advisory board and more of an apologist for the Administration 's economic policies . There seems to be little chance of similar trouble under Burns . Said he : " My inclination would be to stay out of the limelight , make my recommendations to the President , indicate the basis for them , and then , having done that , to remain eternally quiet .
