Somewhat sooner than expected , Fidel Castro last week took over direct control of the Cuban government . Premier Jose Miro Cardona resigned , along with his Cabinet . Assuming the premiership . Castro quit as commander of the armed forces , giving that job to his ice-eyed brother Raul , 27 . <P> The move , said Fidel Castro , " distressed ' ' him , but it was " necessary for the good of the revolution . " It put him only a step away from the presidency , now held by his hand-picked choice , Manuel Urrutia . There were signs that Castro , who is 32 , might move up to Urrutia 's job before too long . Under the Cuban constitution , the President can not be younger than 35 . Last week news got out that the constitution had been quietly changed by a mere vote of the Cabinet a fortnight ago-and the new minimum fixed at 30 . In the premiership , Castro can take his time about calling elections , about which his government , unlike the revolutionary juntas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Power Divided . There was an inevitability about last week 's changes , but their suddenness was caused by a moral crisis . The government was at loggerheads over Cuba 's tourist-trapping casinos , closed since the fall of Batista . At first Fidel Castro opposed gambling on principle . Provisional President Urrutia , Premier Miro Cardona and the Cabinet backed him up . But Castro 's stand on principle dissolved in the face of the rapidly falling foreign exchange ( it is now possible to fire a .45 down any hall of the Havana Hilton without hitting even a mouse ) and of the jobless and strike-minded workers . <P> Castro went to speak to a meeting of some 2,000 restaurant , hotel , nightclub and casino workers , and promised that gambling would be resumed this week . Afterward , he exploded to a friend : " This nonsense can not go on . This is the limit . Instead of solving problems , the government is creating them daily . " <P> Nonsense was precisely the word for much that has been going on in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for much of it was Castro himself . Never one to stay hitched , he failed to back his Cabinet while making pie-in-the-sky promises to all supplicants . <P> Amid the confusion , the Cabinet did its best to get a few things done . It drew up a plan to replace Batista 's corrupt lottery with a lottery-bond program designed to help finance a $100 million housing project. * Last week , an accounting of the Cuban treasury 's cash reserves was finally completed . Discovery : in five years . Dictator Batista squandered $423 million , leaving the country with only $110,710,947 , or some $60 million less than the legal minimum . To rebuild the reserves , a system of import licenses was clamped on a long list of goods-with the promise of stiff controls if dollar-draining imports are not held down .
