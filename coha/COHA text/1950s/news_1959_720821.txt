txt The first complete replace . ment of a human heart valve with a plastic substitute was reported Saturday by a University of Virginia surgeon . Dr. William H. Muller Jr . reported to the American Heart association that a woman patient has lived almost a year since the valve was installed and is " progressing satisfactorily . " The plastic valve is a dir e c t replacement for the Valve of the aorta , the large blood vessel that constitutes the main trunkline of blood to the body . The aortic valve controls the flow of blood from the heart to the rest of the body . It is one of the most difficult organs of the body to operate on because of its vital location . , Describes Earlier Model Muller told the-32d annual scientific m e e ti n g of the heart association that the plastic valve is designed to correct a condition known as aortic valve insufficiency , a condition in which the leaflike sections of the natural valve fail to close completely after blood is pumped thru . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain on it . Muller said that in recent years Dr. Charles Hufnagel of Georgetown university , Washington , D. C. , had developed a plastic valve which partly corrects the condition . - The Hufnagel valve consists of a tiny ball that moves back and forth in a plastic tube grafted into . the aorta at a certain distance from the natural valve . Misses Third of Blood Muller indicated that in many cases the Hufnagel valve greatly reduces the amount of blood that backs up into the heart . But he said that , because of its relatively Diagram shows ( 1 ) valve of aorta , where . Muller artificial valve is inserted and ( 2 ) section of aorta where Hufnagel valve is placed . remote position from the natural valve , it is prevented from handling some 35 per cent of the blood pumped from the heart . In contrast , the new valve described by Muller is a direct substitute for the natural valve , inserted at the same location . " I feel , " Muller told reporters at a news conference , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable . And I feel that this type of valve will eventually replace the Hufnagel valve . "
