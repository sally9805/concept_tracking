EXCEPT THE LORD ( 276 pp. ) - Joyce Cary-Harper ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> One test of a good fictional character is whether he leads a double life in 1 ) the writer 's imagination , 2 ) the reader 's memory . Joyce Gary , who has created some of the most memorable characters in 20th century fiction , has frequently passed this test with lovable scamps , e.g. , Gulley Jimson ( The Horse 's Mouth ) , Sara Monday ( Herself Surprised ) . Chester Nimmo , who made his debut in Gary 's last novel , Prisoner of Grace ( TIME , Oct. 20 , 1952 ) , is no scamp but a fireballing politico who marries into money , gets elected to Parliament , enters the Cabinet and finally becomes Lord Nimmo , without ever losing his missionary zeal or his sense of political destiny . Except the Lord , * which takes Chester Nimmo back in point of time to his mid-Victorian boyhood and young manhood , asks , retrospectively , one central question : What made Nimmo run ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sternly religious . They are also a game clan . Knocked down in one round of human experience , they are eagerly up at the bell for another . Most of the time in Except the Lord , young Chester is busy picking himself up off the floor . <P> He is floored by the poverty that haunts his father with the workhouse , wrecks his mother 's and sister 's health and prematurely kills both , and sweeps the Nimmos into humiliating dependence on neighbors . He is floored by his preacher-father 's Puritan code and his mathematical proofs of the imminent second coming of Christ . He is floored by his elder sister 's erratic half-fond , half-bullying rule over him when their mother dies . <P> By the maxims of contemporary popular psychology , this kind of childhood should lay a maze of neuroses for little Chester , and keep him confused , embittered and forever shying at life 's challenges . That it fills him instead with great expectations and the drive to make them come true is a sign of the soundness and not the weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his destiny in adolescent flashes of intuition . Standing in a tent show before a penny-dreadful melodrama , he feels the actor 's hypnotic hold on the crowd , senses that his words too may one day sway and spellbind . Standing , on another day , atop a rain-drenched knoll with his Adventist father and nine of the faithful awaiting the second coming of Christ , he feels his faith oozing away . He turns to the prophets of social revolution , soaks up the teachings of Proudhon , Marx and Bakunin. and becomes a labor organizer . But a violent and bitter strike convinces him that his new gods are false . At novel 's end , Chester Nimmo , over 21 , is clean of illusions " , and ready for whatever further adventures life and Author Gary have in store for him . That there will be more seems likely , for Chester Nimmo has captured the next best thing to Joyce Gary 's comic genius , his endless curiosity . <P> <P> * " Except the Lord build the house , they labor in vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )
