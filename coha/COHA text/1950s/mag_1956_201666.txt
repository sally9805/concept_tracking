Dining with Marshal Tito at Brioni last month , Russia 's First Party Secretary Nikita Khrushchev , his big mauler wrapped around a glass of slivovitz. gave a toast to Socialism . Said he : " Socialism is like an army marching . If one man is out of step , it spoils everything . " Cracked a lesser Yugoslav at Nikita 's bent elbow : " When a soldier is out of step is it the fault of the soldier or of the music that 's being played ? ' ' Last week the news from Belgrade was that the music from Moscow was still out of tune , and/or Yugoslavia 's Communists were still out of step . <P> Tito , in his second week back from the Communist conclave in the Crimea , stayed out of reach in his White Palace . But an official spokesman of his government declared : " No decisions were made in the Khrushchev-Tito talks which were of a purely private character . " Private or not , a lot of Yugoslav Communists were being told , officially and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one unexpected thing , " a Tito penman confessed in the official party organ Borba . " The letter circulated by the Soviet Communists to the satellite Communist parties . . . expressed the opinion that our country and its leadership is not Marxist . This is not in the spirit of the . . . Moscow declaration on relations between the Yugoslav Communists and the Soviet Communist Party . . . " <P> " That Dog . " Rank-and-file Yugoslav Communists were getting an even more ' sensational line on the talks . This was that there was a definite split in the top Soviet hierarchy , with pro-Titoists Khrushchev , Bulganin and Foreign Minister Dmitry Shepilov ranged against such anti-Titoists as Presidium Members Molotov , Kaganovich , Suslov and Soviet President Voroshilov . At a recent plenum of the Central Committee in Moscow , according to the story being circulated among the Belgrade Communists , Molotov ( downgraded from Foreign Minister at the time of Tito 's visit to the Soviet Union last June ) had attacked Yugoslav Vice President Edvard Kardelj ( a leader in Yugoslavia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And to underscore Molotov 's attitude towards Tito himself , a story was being told of a Peking reception at which Red China 's Mao Tse-tung inquired of the Belgrade ambassador , " How is Tito ? " and Molotov , standing near by , was heard to say , " That dog . " <P> The visit to Belgrade of Communist delegations from some satellite states was being explained as a triumph for Tito 's bold policy of more independence for those countries-but also as a sign of Khrushchev 's inability to sell that liberalized policy to his Kremlin colleagues . It was given out that , although relations are improving ( e.g. , ousted Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy , who has Tito 's backing , was reinstated to Communist Party membership last week ) , there were still many outstanding " ideological differences " between satellites Hungary . Rumania , Bulgaria and independent Yugoslavia .
