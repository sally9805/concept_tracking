He should have the ringing rhetoric of a tent-meeting preacher and the money-making genius of a loan shark , but first of all , a college president should be a scholar . Last week the heads of two of the nation 's most prestigious women 's educational institutions gave evidence that whatever he does , a scholar is not necessarily happy as a college president . The two presidents , both of whom resigned : <P> Wilbur Kitchener Jordan of Radcliffe , who took over the college in 1943 , carried out the bargain struck with Harvard by his predecessor , Ada Comstock Notestein ( TIME , Nov. 24 ) , under which Radcliffe girls were admitted to Harvard classes . Reserved , grey-haired W. K. Jordan instituted a series of graduate seminars , found time to teach two courses in 17th century English history , has done well at money raising . In speaking of his resignation last week , Jordan , 57 , listed his academic interests as " teaching , research and administration , " in that order , added : " I have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and administrative tasks have become heavier . " <P> Harold Taylor of Sarah Lawrence , who in 1945 rode out of the West ( the philosophy department of the University of Wisconsin ) and , Lochinvar-like , captured the hearts of blue-jeaned undergraduates as the nation 's youngest ( 30 ) college president . Handsome Harold Taylor skied , played tennis , taught classes at Manhattan 's New School in his first years at Sarah Lawrence , throughout his term tossed off opinions ( " It 's important that someone raise some hell with philosophy " ) as John D. Rockefeller Sr. passed out dimes . He ran his college well , but had to give up teaching as administrative duties piled up . Recently Taylor 's best-reported diversion has been a low-comedy wrangle with the Westchester County American Legion , to whom Sarah Lawrence 's progressive-education scheme of life ( no formal majors , no grades ) smells of left-wingery . Determined to return to a scholar 's life , he wrote : " The steadily increasing burden of responsibility placed upon the American college president for administering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him the opportunity to share in the intellectual and educational life .
