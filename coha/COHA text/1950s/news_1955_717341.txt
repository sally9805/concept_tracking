Captain Bradley disclosed yesterday that he had held discussions on the strike impasse with Maxwell Powers , executive director of Greenwich House , who he Said had volunteered to " act as a citizens committee interested in waterfront problems . " Mr. Powers , at his office at 27 Barrow Street , confirmed that he had talked with the I. L. A. leader , and said he also had conferred with Samuel M. Lane , executive director of the Waterfront Commission : The possibility of developing , the Powers intervention into a settlement of the dispute appeared to be thin . The union has been insisting that its men would not return to work unless Governor Harriman of New York and Gov . Robert B. Meyner of New Jersey sit down with a union committee and listen to its grievances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its administration of the law ; that it abuses its subpoena authority and that it is unfair in dealing with former criminals seeking to work on the docks . Both Governors , as well as the Waterfront Commission , have rejected the idea of an intermediary citizen committee to hear these grievances and both have refused to - listen to the longshoremen . They also have pointed out that the union has never documented or presented its complaints . Both Governors have ? uro-ed the men to get back to work . Powers ' Interest Not New Mr. Powers said that he had become interested in the dock situation long before the present dispute . Two months ago he visited Mr. Lane in behalf of a man who. had come to Greenwich ' House for help . The man had been convicted of a crime and was trying to rehabilitate him- , self , but the Waterfront Com- ' mission had denied him the necessary work permit . Mr. Lane agreed to review the case and the man eventually was registered as a longshoreman . " I indicated to Mr .. Lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House could be of help we would be glad to put ourselves at their disposal , " Mr. Powers said . He.had a conference with the commission director yesterday morning and later went to the I. L. A. for a talk . Mr. Lane insisted that the men return to work ; that they formulate their grievances and present them in writing ; and that the I. L. A. ? recoonize the commission and accept it as a bona , fide agency and cease its attacks . And he made clear that he would not accept any intermediary in the commission-union dispute . Last night Mr. Lane said acceptance of a third party in the dispute Would merely result in a dilution of the commission 's authority . He emphasized that the commission would " gladly review " any cases presented to it by the union  --  cases that the union leadership believed had been unfairly handled . " Except for the I. L. A. itself we are the most interested party in these cases , " Mr. Lane said .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
