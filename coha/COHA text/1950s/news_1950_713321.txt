I. , telephone headquarters , Kings County District Attorney - Miles F. disclosed yesterdav Arguing before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn against a writ to reduce Gross ' $250,000 bail , Mr. revealed also that some of the bookmaker 's thirty runners  --  agents who telephoned wagers to the office  --  employed as many as six " sub-runners . " The five black-robed justices , sitting in the quiet austerity of the courtroom , were told the grand jury investigation began with published charges that as-much as $250,000 a week was being paid for bookmaking protection to members of the Police Department . " The most flagrant of the gambling rings in this Kings county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. informed the jurists . Decision was reserved on the writ but not until sharp questions directed at Gross ' activities were addressed by the bench to his attorney , Michael Kern , who admitted his client was a bookmaker . New - Police Set-Up Meanwhile it was learned that the Police Department was about to set up a completely new systtm for the suppression of gambling and the elimination of the " taint " of corruption . Commissioner Thomas . F. Murphy has decided upon the re-establishment of the Commissioner 's confidential squad to be headed by Deputy Chief Inspector James R. Kennedy , informed quarters said . Chief Kennedy will have ten plainclothes men to do the spadework on gambling under the supervision of captains , lieutenants and sergeants . The officers will be charged with investigative duties and will follow through on all cases to eliminate the " contacts " that in the past have often resulted in bookmaking cases being thrown out for lack of evidence or testimony improperly presented . The Commissioner 's gambling squad will work alongside the reconstituted plainclothes division under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a check on the other . Still a third check will be provided by the assignment of Deputy Commissioners to over-all supervision of gambling law enforcement . One will be assigned to Manhattan , a second to the Bronx and Queens , a third to Brooklyn , and a fourth to Richmond . A formal announcement of this plan is expected but the police head yesterday confined himself to the statement that " every member // of the department " would be responsible for the enforcement of the gambling laws . He said the patrolman on ' the beat , who formerly was supposed to submit a report to the commanding officer in his precinct when he became aware of a gambling law violation , would be charged with the duty of making an on-the-spot arrest . Under the old system the patrolman 's report , when it was made , would be forwarded to the Inspector 's plainclothes squad for " action . " O'Dwyer at Rookies ' Trial Other developments of the day included : 1 . The appearance of former Mayor William O'Dwyer and Mr. at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . The prosecutor testified to the " hostility " of the police and his difficulties with Chief Inspector August W. Flath . Mr. O'Dwyer told of ordering an investigation by his Investigation Commissioner and of Mr. rejecting his offer to take over the police rule violation phase of the inquiry . 2 . Kings County Judge Samuel S. Leibowitz continued the hearing on retired Inspector Frederick A. Hofsaes and said he would hold him in contempt if the gift television set sent by Gross , which Mr. Hofsaes put out for junk last August , were found to have been in working order . 3 . Mr. 's disclosure that the grand jury 's decision to call a " prominent public figure "  --  a call since deferred  --  was not discussed with him . Announcement of the panel 's wish was made in open court by Judge Leibowitz last Friday . 4 . Sentencing of two brothers to three months in jail by Kings County Judge George J. Joyce on their plea of guilty to a charge of conspiracy to violate the gambling laws . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uncover notations of " ice " payments , police protection graft . The Gross writ was called for argument at 2:05 P. M. A few minutes earlier , escorted by a deputy sheriff , Gross had entered the courtroom and taken a front row seat . He wore a light gray summer suit and blue tie . Short of stature ? he did not appear much more than five fet tall  --  but stockily built , his jet black , wavy hair was pomaded so that it fairly shone . Seated on the bench were Associate Justices John B. Johnston , acting presiding justice , in the center , and on either side Frank F. Adel , John MacCrate , Charles W. U. Sneed and Henry G. Wenzel Jr . Mr. Kern said Gross had no criminal record " according to my information , " that he " spoke very frankly " and was an " agreeable and pliable witness " when he was a " guest " of the District Attorney before bail was fixed . The attorney recalled that bail of $100,000 had been asked originally . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with Judge Leibowitz , Justice Johnston said that was not in the court papers and admonished him to " get down to the merits . " Gross , his lawyer told the court , was being held in City Prison not as a material witness but as a defendant . Further , he said , he was treated as an ordinary prisoner but was " kept in virtual solitary confinement . " Justice Johnston . who is from Brooklyn , queried : " Would you ask the court to advise the Sheriff how to conduct his jail ? " He told the lawyer his own papers recited that Gross was being held as a material witness , but Mr. Kern said he desired to show that that was so in name only . To bolster this contention he said that Judge Leibowitz had ordered a twenty-four-hour-a-day guard to be maintained over Gross , but under questioning admitted Mr. Kern did not know that of his own knowledge . " The conditions of his detention are being imposed only to make him give statements that he has not been willing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Kern declared . " The bail is excessive and prohibitive and was set evidently because he has not answered questions as the District Attorney would want him to answer them . " Mr. reviewed the history of the case and stressed its " seriousness . " After commenting on the more than $50,000 bet in one afternoon , he told of the syndicate 's evident " police contacts . " Reading from the wiretap conversations , he said Gross received warning that the Inwood place was " hot " and would have to be abandoned . The District Attorney then disclosed that his men had listened in on " two very important calls " that showed Gross had thirty runners and that some of them had as many as six sub-runners . Evidence regarding the first conversation has " not been developed yet , " the prosecutor said , sd that he could not reveal its nature . The second ' conversation was the one made public involving a $350 shakedown by an unidentified policeman for " a new regime " and his insistence on a stand-in arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inwood headquarters and the accounting offices in downtown Brooklyn , Mr. said notations of XX were found and that this symtkol represented payments to police . " It became apparent to us , " he said , " that Gross was the key to the entire combination and that only he could tell who he dealt with in the Police Department . " He has not been free and frank , but very limited on what he would say . He asked to be kept in protective custody and expressed a desire to see Judge Leibowitz alone . He told the judge many things , but not specific things . He told us what he could tell if he wanted to tell as to corruption in the Police Department of the City of New 1York . He showed clearly in the examination that he had the knowledge but that at this time he would not give details . " Ultimately Gross would be brought before the grand jury , Mr. promised , but when the necessity no longer existed of affording him immunity . Justice Johnston ordered Gross remanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave opposing counsel until noon today to file any additional papers . At the departmental trial of two of his rookies , Theodore Warren and Allen , Mr. said he found " nothing but hostility and a " completely unfriendly attitude " on the part of the police when he was summoned to the Wilson Avenue , Brooklyn , station early on . the morning of July 7 . The previous night the two young policemen were said to have engaged in an altercation in a tavern in the Bushwick section . An inspector whose name he did not know " cast numerous reflections on the two patrolmen and at one time called one of them a coward , " the prosecutor said . None of the participants in the fracas , he declared , sought to prefer charges against his aides . Mr. testified that he and Chief Inspector Flath had several telephone conversations in which he resisted attempts by Mr. Flath to have a police commander assigned to his 's police staff . " The conversations were unfriendly and were ended with one or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of the two young policemen , he said , were that they " appeared sober . " He would , he said , take the policemen back on his staff if they were cleared . " Call Me Bill " Former Mayor O'Dwyer arrived at Brooklyn Headquarters , in a police automobile that was put at his disposal , at 2:10 P. M. Waving a greeting to the small crowd that had gathered , calling out " hiya neighbors " and shaking hands with some policemen , he went to the fourth floor trial room where he was closeted with Third Deputy Police Commissioner Aaron Frank , conducting the trial . The first , question by Louis Waldman , attorney for the policemen , who had sent him a telegram to appear as a defense witness , was : " By what title do you want to be addressed ? " " Louis , " Mr. O'Dwyer said , " I guess you 'll have to call me Bill . " As his examination continued he was addressed as Mr. Ambassador , General and on one occasion as Mayor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James H. Sheils to make an inquiry into the cases of the two rookies , among other cases , in July . " Only one thing influenced my decision , " Mr. O'Dwyer said , " and that was a complaint in writing from some lawyer against these men which was handed to me by the then Police Commissioner William P. O'Brien with the request that it be investigated by an independent party . " He had only one attitude toward the and any other investigation , he said , and that was that where there . was a charge made it should be investigated . He said proposed modifications of the police retirement laws should be " looked into " and pointed out that this was a legislative matter . Mr. O'Dwyer was on the witness stand thirty-eight minutes . Judge Leibowitz conducted the Hofsaes contempt hearing in his chambers . Assistant District Attorney Julius A. Helfand , in charge of the gambling inquiry , again went over Mr. Hofsaes ' testimony before the grand jury . Judge Leibowitz gave him until Friday morning to produce evidence that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hofsaes put it out for the Sanitation men to pick up as junk . The brothers sentenced for conspiracy by Judge Joyce were Thomas Starace , 44 years old , of 8912 Shore Court , and Salvatore , 33 , of 1761 Seventy-ninth Street , both Brooklyn . Enez Dorso , 34 , who operated Eva 's Rest at 113 Fifty-seventh Street , Brooklyn , where the raid was made April 5 , got a suspended sentence . Two more detectives were added to the five demoted Monday by Commissioner Murphy . Eleven additional patrolmen were transferred to plainclothes duty , and three officers were transferred in what were said to be routine shifts .
