Columnist Drew Pearson has been gunning for Florida 's Governor Fuller Warren . Pearson had urged the Florida legislature to impeach Warren on the ground that his campaign had been heavily financed by gamblers ( TIME , July 16 , 1951 ) . Last week , on vacation , Pearson gave Warren the use of his column for an uncensored counterattack . Wrote Guest Columnist Warren : <P> " Like all gifted men , Colonel* Pearson has a few failings . . . President Roosevelt called him a ' chronic liar . ' I ca n't go quite that far . Colonel Pearson sometimes tells the truth . . . It may not be intentional , but it 's there . . . I estimate that Baron Munchausen 's contemporary counterpart has told no less than two dozen lies about me within the past two years . Assuming I have received only my pro rata share of Baron Pearson 's prevarications , this data may be projected to the conclusion that this modern Munchausen has concocted 24 falsehoods about every person on whom he has unleashed his yelping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be estimated that during the past two years it has suited the purposes of Colonel Pearson to smear at least 2,000 persons . . . It mathematically follows that Colonel Pearson has manufactured . . . 48,000 units of mendacity . That is mass production on a massive scale ! The miracles of mass production achieved by General Motors sink into insignificance . . . " <P> <P> * Pearson is an honorary colonel on the governor 's own staff .
