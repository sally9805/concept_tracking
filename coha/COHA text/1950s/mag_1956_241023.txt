Latest installments of two monumental publishing projects , vastly different in subject matter and yet similar in their grandiose gusto for life , letters and history : <P> <P> A HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PEOPLES , VOL . II , THE NEW WORLD , by Winston S. Churchill ( 433 pp. ; Dodd , Mead ; $6 ) , rolls with Churchillian eloquence over those troubled years between the first great Tudors . including Bloody Mary ( the last Roman Catholic Queen of England ) , and the bloodless Revolution of 1688 ( which established Britain in a truce of class , power and tradition ) . Churchill presents , with the terse clarity of one of his own state papers , an England emerging from the age of the first Elizabeth , when most Englishmen were sick of blood spilled over theological differences . They were to find that theology disguised as politics could be even bloodier . Churchill argues that ancient English liberties reposed in the monarch , the church and Parliament-but that Parliament , when it overthrew the others , could be a worse tyrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero to so many English historians , is Churchill 's villain . He considers the Lord Protector- who , invoking God 's will , ordered 3,000 men put to the sword in one day-a warning to all those who would be willing to kill others in order to improve the survivors . Says Churchill : " A school grew up to gape in awe and some in furtive admiration at these savage times . . . The twentieth century has sharply recalled its intellectuals from such vain indulgences . " <P> In his story of England 's Civil War , crowded with gaudy and eloquent figures of drama , squalor and nobility , Churchill has also been writing a neglected chapter in American history . His narrative takes U.S. schoolbook history a generation back from where it usually starts . His brilliant sketch of turbulent 17th century England explains just how the Puritans on the run , gentlemen adventurers and refugees got their start in the New World , and what they had in mind when they touched American soil . <P> <P> BOSWELL IN SEARCH OF A WIFE , edited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; McGraw-Hill ; $6 ) , is Volume VI of the Boswell Papers being brought out by a Yale task force of scholars . It follows young Boswell ( he had not yet written his Life of Samuel Johnson ) through three years ( 1766-69 ) while he was trying to find a wife rich enough to make him a wealthy man , beautiful enough to make him a happy man , pious enough to make him a good man . " Bozzy 's " solemn efforts to fill this tall order make scandalously funny reading . He was already the father of a bastard son ( who died in infancy ) , and now a second child was on the way as a result of his " licentious passion " for one Mrs. Dodds ( a " sweet little mistress . . . admirably formed for amorous dalliance " - but " she debases my dignity " and " costs me a great deal of money " ) . <P> Just as Mrs. Dodds was about to give birth , Boswell met the very heiress he was looking for-Miss Catherine Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Overjoyed , Bozzy rushed off to drink Miss Blair 's health , got very tight and passed the night with " a whore worthy of Boswell if Boswell must have a whore . " As " a just retribution for my licentiousness , " he " got a disease from which I suffer severely . "
