txt The American Psychological Association , meeting in New York City , has had its say about space travel . And one of the foregathered psychologists has given his views on what physical and personality , attributes would best fit the first traveler to the moon for his trip . He says , in short , that the bill might best be filled by a psychotic woman midget with a Ph . D. in physics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Well , we can understand why the Ph . D. from the famous engineering school might be needed , and that a midget would squeeze into a space ship more easily than would Buck Rogers . We can even understand why a woman , with her lower center of gravity and more introspective nature , might be better than a man for the trip . What we do n't quite grasp is the " psychotic " business ? the one on which the psychologists are supposed to be experts . If they mean they do n't want to go to the moon we can understand their position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if they mean that adventurous individuals are necessarily crazy we would like to hear reports on the psychotic states of such pioneers as Columbus , the Wright Brothers , Thomas Jefferson and Sigmund Freud .
