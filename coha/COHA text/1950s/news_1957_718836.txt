txt The metropolitan area has for several years awaited the p , romulgation of bold , far-sighted , informed policy that might not only save commuter rail transportation into New York City from extinction but also extend and improve it , It may be that we have the beginnings of such a policy in Arthur W. Page 's report as project director to the Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission . As project director evaluating this and other expert consultant studies in a massive ? survey financed to a cost of nearly a million dollars by the Port of New York Authority for the commission created by New York and New Jersey , Mr. Page proposes a program that involves $400,000,000 in capital cost ; the building of a closed loop extension of the New York City subway system into New Jersey through two new tunnels under the Hudson River ; government ownership or use of the commuting rail facilities in New Jersey ; tax exemption and access to tax sources for a new bi-state public agency to be called the Metropolitan District of New York and New Jersey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking as to the New York area . While it deals initially with the rescue'and improvement of commuter rail travel to New Jersey , it may in important elements of principle be regarded as extendable to rail lines into Westchester , Connecticut and Long Islan4 . It should , therefore , be studied not simply for its physical plan of a convenient new loop into New Jersey but , more importantly , for innovation of governmental policy that would almost inevitably spread . The new Hudson tunnels , permit-11 ting travel in two directions on a ' rail loop requiring forty-one minutes for a complete round- trip , would be situated at the Battery in Manhattan and at Fifty-ninth Street . This loop would use B. M. T.-Broadway line tracks from the Columbus Circle area to north of City Hall . In New Jersey there would be five stations , and passengerscould come aboard from sta-1 tions of present New Jersey railroads crossed by the loop , or from automobiles they had parked near loop stations , Great advantages of convenience and savings in travel time are offered . A vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour 's travel time . The fare on the loop would be 15 cents plus another 15 cents to the New York subway . An annual deficit of $12,000,000 is foreseen , and it would be levied against taxpayers , twothirds to twelve counties west of the Hudson and one-third td New York City . It can readily be seen that , there is plenty of fuel for controversy ? as to the route of the loop , as to the bond-issuing power granted , as to , the power to mandate within prescribed limits the , collection of taxes under obligations assumed by local taxing bodies , and as to what some will see as " bailing out " the railroads . It would be premature , before there is full exposure to argument at public hearings , to rush into full endorsement  --  a step from which the commission itself as well as the Port Authority has carefully abstained . Nevertheless , we have here a " report that deserves the most sober , sympathetic study . It seems to promise , for a dollar cost so moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed at ' it ; a splendid improvement and reclamation of rail travel . Those who would oppose tit , or some such principle for salvaging commuter transportation by train , owe the public an answer to the question : What is the better alternative ?
