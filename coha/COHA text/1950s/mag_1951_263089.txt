The racing sloop L'Apache , a 73-footer , was running in second place in one of the world 's longest yacht races-from Los Angeles harbor to Honolulu . At dawn one day last week , L'Apache 's boom tackle broke . It had to be repaired under way , with 8-ft. seas running . Precious time was wasting . Crewman Ted Sierks , 40 , an ex-Marine and photographer , was braced against the rail , trying to get the fractious boom under control . The rail broke and Sierks slid into the sea . <P> A life ring with knife and flashlight attached was thrown to him , but before the crippled L'Apache could come about and work back to the spot , Sierks was out of sight in the vastness of the Pacific . Six nearby yachts converged on the area when they heard L'Apache radio the shocking message : " Man overboard ! " From Honolulu , 800 miles away , the Navy sent ships to the manhunt : an escort carrier , four destroyers , three destroyer escorts . An airrescue B-17 droned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search . <P> Sierks , gripping the life ring , found himself in one of the most appallingly lonely spots a man could imagine . He soon gave up hope , but found that he could not give up trying : " It 's hard to drown when you know how to swim . " That first day , sharks pestered him . He killed one : " I grabbed his tail , flipped him over and ripped up the belly with my knife . " He had plenty of time to think . " I thought about how I was messing up the race for a lot of people . I thought about the time I had wasted in my life . " At sunrise the next morning , the sharks came back . <P> Aboard the destroyer escort Douglas A. Munro the captain pledged a $50 reward for the first man to spot Sierks . The Navy , which knows how long a man can last in the open sea , ordered the search ended at 2 p.m . At 1:15 two seamen sighted a bobbing blond head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sierks ' ordeal had lasted 30 hours and 15 minutes . He would not soon forget it . Said he : " Now that I 've been rescued , I figure there must have been a reason . There must be something for me to do . I 'll have to try and find out what it is. "
