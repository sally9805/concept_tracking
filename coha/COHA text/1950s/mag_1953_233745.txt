The revolution against " flatties " ( two-dimensional movies ) is one year old ; 3-D , which temporarily saved Hollywood from bankruptcy and scared most cine-moguls out of their ulcers , began its second year last week . Cinerama celebrated its birthday playing to capacity crowds in New York , Chicago , Detroit and Los Angeles . It had not only grossed a phenomenal $4,300,000 but had also become a social phenomenon . Travel bureaus this summer were flooded with requests from people who wanted to see the original of what they saw in Cinerama : the Grand Canyon , the canals of Venice , the bull rings of Spain . Even the roller coaster at New York 's Rockaway Playland-the opening attraction in Cinerama 's two-hour documentary-had enjoyed a record year . <P> Real stereoscopic 3-D had enjoyed cometlike popularity , but only as a novelty , mainly because Hollywood had merely thrown things at the customers and failed to provide anything much to look at through the polaroid glasses . Said one California sage : " Every studio in Hollywood agrees that the 3-D vogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an , inventor had patented polaroid sun glasses that can be changed with the flick of a finger into 3-D spectacles failed to cheer the true stereoscopists . <P> The first wide-screen CinemaScope epic , soth Century-Fox 's The Robe , was breaking box-office records all over the country . Manhattan 's Roxy Theater reported a first-week gross of $264,000 . It was the same story in Chicago , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Kansas City and San Francisco . Foxmen dreamily talked of total earnings topping Gone With the Wind 's record $35 million take . Hollywood Reporter Columnist Mike Connolly wrote : " The Robe just has to be the greatest grosser of all time . It might even outsell the Bible . " <P> The California pulse-feelers debated how much of The Robe 's success could be credited to CinemaScope and how much to the lavish production itself and its smasheroo promotion campaign . A few suspected its triumph might be due to the simple fact that with all its spectacular slickness , The Robe was based on a great theme ( Christ 's passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Douglas ) . As Samuel Goldwyn remarked : " In any consideration of new dimensions for motion pictures , the fact still remains that the most important dimension is that of the story . " <P> The success of the first movie in Cinema-Scope did not cause a rush to the Cinema-Scope bandwagon . At MGM , Paramount , Columbia , Universal-International and Warner , 3-D production was lagging . As one studio executive said : " We 're playing it down the middle ... Whichever way the wind turns the fastest buck , that 's the way we 'll turn . "
