" The lovely days disappear , the planets turn in circles , but you walk straight toward what you can not see : the dark days , the sagging skin . " The lugubrious sentiment is by Poet Raymond Queneau , but the dark caramel voice which murmurs it in throbbing French in a newly released Columbia album belongs to a 29-year-old Parisian chanteuse named Juliette Greco . For U.S. listeners the album offers a fresh view of a singer whose literate , melancholy repertory and haunting voice have made her the musical idol of the existentialists and a reigning favorite along the music hall and nightclub circuit . <P> Sign of the Era . When Juliette was 15 the Germans deported her divorced mother and her sister to a labor camp . Left to roam the streets , Juliette fell in with a band of homeless youngsters , learned to steal by day and sleep in doorways by night . <P> One rainy evening in 1945 , she and her street gang moved into a deserted club on the Left Bank . When the club reopened several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged Greco and her band to continue to make it their headquarters . " The proprietor saw in us a sign of the era , " says Singer Greco . So did some of Tabou 's guests . To Le Tabou came the existentialists and their friends-Sartre , Simone de Beauvoir , Christian Berard , Albert Camus and Jean Cocteau . They dubbed Greco and her band " Les Rats des Caves , " fed and clothed them . Cocteau gave Greco a small part in his film Orpheus . In 1949 she launched her singing career . <P> Poems in the Throat . Garbed from head to toe in black ( " I am probably the most covered-up singer in the business " ) , with her straight black hair hanging to her waist , she chanted the changes on blighted love , nostalgia and despair in a husky contralto which ranged from a whisper to a raucous shout . Such personages as Franois Mauriac and Franoise Sagan dashed off songs for her . Sartre wrote that " in her throat she has millions of poems not yet written . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " found her " smashing . " <P> No longer an underfed , despairing Rat des Caves , Juliette has been married and divorced , has a two-year-old daughter , and last week was working on her fifth film ( L'Homme et L'Enfant , with Eddie Constantine ) . She was planning a singing tour of South Africa , and had the prospect of a trip to Hollywood next winter to make a film with Danny Kaye . The wartime street days seemed far away . " They molded my life , " she said , " but in my case , it 's better not to look back . "
