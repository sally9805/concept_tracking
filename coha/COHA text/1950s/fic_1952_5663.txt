Illustration : Illustrated by CONNELL the Leech By PHILLIPS BARBEE A visitor should be fed , but this one could eat you out of house and home ... literally ! The leech was waiting for food . For millennia it had been drifting across the vast emptiness of space . Without consciousness , it had spent the countless centuries in the void between the stars . It was unaware when it finally reached a sun . Life-giving radiation flared around the hard , dry spore . Gravitation tugged at it . A planet claimed it , with other stellar debris , and the leech fell , still dead-seeming within its tough spore case . One speck of dust among many , the winds blew it around the Earth , played with it , and let it fall . On the ground , it began to stir . Nourishment soaked in , permeating the spore case . It grew  --  and fed . * * * * * Frank Conners came up on the porch and coughed twice . " Say , pardon me , Professor , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sagging couch . His horn-rimmed glasses were perched on his forehead , and he was snoring very gently . " I 'm awful sorry to disturb you , " Conners said , pushing back his battered felt hat . " I know it 's your restin ' week and all , but there 's something damned funny in the ditch . " The pale man 's left eyebrow twitched , but he showed no other sign of having heard . Frank Conners coughed again , holding his spade in one purple-veined hand . " Didja hear me , Professor ? " " Of course I heard you , " Micheals said in a muffled voice , his eyes still closed . " You found a pixie . " " A what ? " Conners asked , squinting at Micheals . " A little man in a green suit . Feed him milk , Conners . " " No , sir . I think it 's a rock . " Micheals opened one eye and focused it in Conners ' general direction . " I 'm awfully sorry about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a ten-year-old custom , and his only eccentricity . All winter Micheals taught anthropology , worked on half a dozen committees , dabbled in physics and chemistry , and still found time to write a book a year . When summer came , he was tired . Arriving at his worked-out New York State farm , it was his invariable rule to do absolutely nothing for a week . He hired Frank Conners to cook for that week and generally make himself useful , while Professor Micheals slept . During the second week , Micheals would wander around , look at the trees and fish . By the third week he would be getting a tan , reading , repairing the sheds and climbing mountains . At the end of four weeks , he could hardly wait to get back to the city . But the resting week was sacred . " I really would n't bother you for anything small , " Conners said apologetically . " But that damned rock melted two inches off my spade . " Micheals opened both eyes and sat up . Conners held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Micheals swung himself off the couch and slipped his feet into battered moccasins . " Let 's see this wonder , " he said . * * * * * The object was lying in the ditch at the end of the front lawn , three feet from the main road . It was round , about the size of a truck tire , and solid throughout . It was about an inch thick , as far as he could tell , grayish black and intricately veined . " Do n't touch it , " Conners warned . " I 'm not going to . Let me have your spade . " Micheals took the spade and prodded the object experimentally . It was completely unyielding . He held the spade to the surface for a moment , then withdrew it . Another inch was gone . Micheals frowned , and pushed his glasses tighter against his nose . He held the spade against the rock with one hand , the other held close to the surface . More of the spade disappeared . " Does n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you notice any the first time ? " Conners shook his head . Micheals picked up a clod of dirt and tossed it on the object . The dirt dissolved quickly , leaving no trace on the gray-black surface . A large stone followed the dirt , and disappeared in the same way . " Is n't that just about the damnedest thing you ever saw , Professor ? " Conners asked . " Yes , " Micheals agreed , standing up again . " It just about is . " He hefted the spade and brought it down smartly on the object . When it hit , he almost dropped the spade . He had been gripping the handle rigidly , braced for a recoil . But the spade struck that unyielding surface and stayed . There was no perceptible give , but absolutely no recoil . " Whatcha think it is ? " Conners asked . " It 's no stone , " Micheals said . He stepped back . " A leech drinks blood . This thing seems to be drinking dirt . And spades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two men looked at each other . On the road , half a dozen Army trucks rolled past . " I 'm going to phone the college and ask a physics man about it , " Micheals said . " Or a biologist . I 'd like to get rid of that thing before it spoils my lawn . " They walked back to the house . * * * * * Everything fed the leech . The wind added its modicum of kinetic energy , ruffling across the gray-black surface . Rain fell , and the force of each individual drop added to its store . The water was sucked in by the all-absorbing surface . The sunlight above it was absorbed , and converted into mass for its body . Beneath it , the soil was consumed , dirt , stones and branches broken down by the leech 's complex cells and changed into energy . Energy was converted back into mass , and the leech grew . Slowly , the first flickers of consciousness began to return . Its first realization was of the impossible smallness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * When Micheals looked the next day , the leech was eight feet across , sticking out into the road and up the side of the lawn . The following day it was almost eighteen feet in diameter , shaped to fit the contour of the ditch , and covering most of the road . That day the sheriff drove up in his model A , followed by half the town . " Is that your leech thing , Professor Micheals ? " Sheriff Flynn asked . " That 's it , " Micheals said . He had spent the past days looking unsuccessfully for an acid that would dissolve the leech . " We got ta get it out of the road , " Flynn said , walking truculently up to the leech . " Something like this , you ca n't let it block the road , Professor . The Army 's got ta use this road . " " I 'm terribly sorry , " Micheals said with a straight face . " Go right ahead , Sheriff . But be careful . It 's hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simplest explanation under the circumstances . Micheals watched with interest as the sheriff tried to shove a crowbar under it . He smiled to himself when it was removed with half a foot of its length gone . The sheriff was n't so easily discouraged . He had come prepared for a stubborn piece of rock . He went to the rumble seat of his car and took out a blowtorch and a sledgehammer , ignited the torch and focused it on one edge of the leech . After five minutes , there was no change . The gray did n't turn red or even seem to heat up . Sheriff Flynn continued to bake it for fifteen minutes , then called to one of the men . " Hit that spot with the sledge , Jerry . " Jerry picked up the sledgehammer , motioned the sheriff back , and swung it over his head . He let out a howl as the hammer struck unyieldingly . There was n't a fraction of recoil . In the distance they heard the roar of an Army convoy . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * Micheals was n't so sure . The answer was easy  --  no substance . No known substance . The driver in the lead jeep held up his hand , and the long convoy ground to a halt . A hard , efficient-looking officer stepped out of the jeep . From the star on either shoulder , Micheals knew he was a brigadier general . " You ca n't block this road , " the general said . He was a tall , spare man in suntans , with a sunburned face and cold eyes . " Please clear that thing away . " " We ca n't move it , " Micheals said . He told the general what had happened in the past few days . " It must be moved , " the general said . " This convoy must go through . " He walked closer and looked at the leech . " You say it ca n't be jacked up by a crowbar ? A torch wo n't burn it ? " " That 's right , " Micheals said , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder . " Ride over it . " Micheals started to protest , but stopped himself . The military mind would have to find out in its own way . The driver put his jeep in gear and shot forward , jumping the leech 's four-inch edge . The jeep got to the center of the leech and stopped . " I did n't tell you to stop ! " the general bellowed . " I did n't , sir ! " the driver protested . The jeep had been yanked to a stop and had stalled . The driver started it again , shifted to four-wheel drive , and tried to ram forward . The jeep was fixed immovably , as though set in concrete . " Pardon me , " Micheals said . " If you look , you can see that the tires are melting down . " The general stared , his hand creeping automatically toward his pistol belt . Then he shouted , " Jump , driver ! Do n't touch that gray stuff . " White-faced , the driver climbed to the hood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was complete silence as everyone watched the jeep . First its tires melted down , and then the rims . The body , resting on the gray surface , melted , too . The aerial was the last to go . The general began to swear softly under his breath . He turned to the driver . " Go back and have some men bring up hand grenades and dynamite . " The driver ran back to the convoy . " I do n't know what you 've got here , " the general said . " But it 's not going to stop a U.S. Army convoy . " Micheals was n't so sure . * * * * * The leech was nearly awake now , and its body was calling for more and more food . It dissolved the soil under it at a furious rate , filling it in with its own body , flowing outward . A large object landed on it , and that became food also . Then suddenly  --  A burst of energy against its surface , and then another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into mass . Little metal pellets struck it , and their kinetic energy was absorbed , their mass converted . More explosions took place , helping to fill the starving cells . It began to sense things  --  controlled combustion around it , vibrations of wind , mass movements . There was another , greater explosion , a taste of real food ! Greedily it ate , growing faster . It waited anxiously for more explosions , while its cells screamed for food . But no more came . It continued to feed on the soil and on the Sun 's energy . Night came , noticeable for its lesser energy possibilities , and then more days and nights . Vibrating objects continued to move around it . It ate and grew and flowed . * * * * * Micheals stood on a little hill , watching the dissolution of his house . The leech was several hundred yards across now , lapping at his front porch . Good-by , home , Micheals thought , remembering the ten summers he had spent there . The porch collapsed into the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumpled . The leech looked like a field of lava now , a blasted spot on the green Earth . " Pardon me , sir , " a soldier said , coming up behind him . " General O'Donnell would like to see you . " " Right , " Micheals said , and took his last look at the house . He followed the soldier through the barbed wire that had been set up in a half-mile circle around the leech . A company of soldiers was on guard around it , keeping back the reporters and the hundreds of curious people who had flocked to the scene . Micheals wondered why he was still allowed inside . Probably , he decided , because most of this was taking place on his land . The soldier brought him to a tent . Micheals stooped and went in . General O'Donnell , still in suntans , was seated at a small desk . He motioned Micheals to a chair . " I 've been put in charge of getting rid of this leech , " he said to Micheals . Micheals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier a scientist 's job . " You 're a professor , are n't you ? " " Yes . Anthropology . " " Good . Smoke ? " The general lighted Micheals ' cigarette . " I 'd like you to stay around here in an advisory capacity . You were one of the first to see this leech . I 'd appreciate your observations on  --  " he smiled  --  " the enemy . " " I 'd be glad to , " Micheals said . " However , I think this is more in the line of a physicist or a biochemist . " " I do n't want this place cluttered with scientists , " General O'Donnell said , frowning at the tip of his cigarette . " Do n't get me wrong . I have the greatest appreciation for science . I am , if I do say so , a scientific soldier . I 'm always interested in the latest weapons . You ca n't fight any kind of a war any more without science . " * * * * * O'Donnell 's sunburned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team of longhairs poking around this thing for the next month , holding me up . My job is to destroy it , by any means in my power , and at once . I am going to do just that . " " I do n't think you 'll find it that easy , " Micheals said . " That 's what I want you for , " O'Donnell said . " Tell me why and I 'll figure out a way of doing it . " " Well , as far as I can figure out , the leech is an organic mass-energy converter , and a frighteningly efficient one . I would guess that it has a double cycle . First , it converts mass into energy , then back into mass for its body . Second , energy is converted directly into the body mass . How this takes place , I do not know . The leech is not protoplasmic . It may not even be cellular  --  " " So we need something big against it , " O'Donnell interrupted . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff here . " " I do n't think you understand me , " Micheals said . " Perhaps I 'm not phrasing this very well . The leech eats energy . It can consume the strength of any energy weapon you use against it . " " What happens , " O'Donnell asked , " if it keeps on eating ? " " I have no idea what its growth-limits are , " Micheals said . " Its growth may be limited only by its food source . " " You mean it could continue to grow probably forever ? " " It could possibly grow as long as it had something to feed on . " " This is really a challenge , " O'Donnell said . " That leech ca n't be totally impervious to force . " " It seems to be . I suggest you get some physicists in here . Some biologists also . Have them figure out a way of nullifying it . " The general put out his cigarette . " Professor , I can not wait while scientists wrangle . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " He paused impressively . " Nothing is impervious to force . Muster enough force and anything will give . Anything . " Professor , " the general continued , in a friendlier tone , " you should n't sell short the science you represent . We have , massed under North Hill , the greatest accumulation of energy and radioactive weapons ever assembled in one spot . Do you think your leech can stand the full force of them ? " " I suppose it 's possible to overload the thing , " Micheals said doubtfully . He realized now why the general wanted him around . He supplied the trappings of science , without the authority to override O'Donnell . " Come with me , " General O'Donnell said cheerfully , getting up and holding back a flap of the tent . " We 're going to crack that leech in half . " * * * * * After a long wait , rich food started to come again , piped into one side of it . First there was only a little , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solids , liquids  --  an amazing variety of edibles . It accepted them all . But the food was coming too slowly for the starving cells , for new cells were constantly adding their demands to the rest . The ever-hungry body screamed for more food , faster ! Now that it had reached a fairly efficient size , it was fully awake . It puzzled over the energy-impressions around it , locating the source of the new food massed in one spot . Effortlessly it pushed itself into the air , flew a little way and dropped on the food . Its super-efficient cells eagerly gulped the rich radioactive substances . But it did not ignore the lesser potentials of metal and clumps of carbohydrates . * * * * * " The damned fools , " General O'Donnell said . " Why did they have to panic ? You 'd think they 'd never been trained . " He paced the ground outside his tent , now in a new location three miles back . The leech had grown to two miles in diameter . Three farming communities had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still stupefied by the memory . The leech had accepted the massed power of the weapons for a while , and then its entire bulk had lifted in the air . The Sun had been blotted out as it flew leisurely over North Hill , and dropped . There should have been time for evacuation , but the frightened soldiers had been blind with fear . Sixty-seven men were lost in Operation Leech , and General O'Donnell asked permission to use atomic bombs . Washington sent a group of scientists to investigate the situation . " Have n't those experts decided yet ? " O'Donnell asked , halting angrily in front of the tent . " They 've been talking long enough . " " It 's a hard decision , " Micheals said . Since he was n't an official member of the investigating team , he had given his information and left . " The physicists consider it a biological matter , and the biologists seem to think the chemists should have the answer . No one 's an expert on this , because it 's never happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's a military problem , " O'Donnell said harshly . " I 'm not interested in what the thing is  --  I want to know what can destroy it . They 'd better give me permission to use the bomb . " Micheals had made his own calculations on that . It was impossible to say for sure , but taking a flying guess at the leech 's mass-energy absorption rate , figuring in its size and apparent capacity for growth , an atomic bomb might overload it  --  if used soon enough . He estimated three days as the limit of usefulness . The leech was growing at a geometric rate . It could cover the United States in a few months . " For a week I 've been asking permission to use the bomb , " O'Donnell grumbled . " And I 'll get it , but not until after those jackasses end their damned talking . " He stopped pacing and turned to Micheals . " I am going to destroy the leech . I am going to smash it , if that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of security now . It 's personal pride . " That attitude might make great generals , Micheals thought , but it was n't the way to consider this problem . It was anthropomorphic of O'Donnell to see the leech as an enemy . Even the identification , " leech , " was a humanizing factor . O'Donnell was dealing with it as he would any physical obstacle , as though the leech were the simple equivalent of a large army . But the leech was not human , not even of this planet , perhaps . It should be dealt with in its own terms . " Here come the bright boys now , " O'Donnell said . * * * * * From a nearby tent a group of weary men emerged , led by Allenson , a government biologist . " Well , " the general asked , " have you figured out what it is ? " " Just a minute , I 'll hack off a sample , " Allenson said , glaring through red-rimmed eyes . " Have you figured out some scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't too difficult , " Moriarty , an atomic physicist , said wryly . " Wrap it in a perfect vacuum . That 'll do the trick . Or blow it off the Earth with anti-gravity . " " But failing that , " Allenson said , " we suggest you use your atomic bombs , and use them fast . " " Is that the opinion of your entire group ? " O'Donnell asked , his eyes glittering . " Yes . " The general hurried away . Micheals joined the scientists . " He should have called us in at the very first , " Allenson complained . " There 's no time to consider anything but force now . " " Have you come to any conclusions about the nature of the leech ? " Micheals asked . " Only general ones , " Moriarty said , " and they 're about the same as yours . The leech is probably extraterrestrial in origin . It seems to have been in a spore-stage until it landed on Earth . " He paused to light a pipe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drop in an ocean . We 'd have had the Earth eaten out from under us before we knew what we were looking for . " They walked in silence for a few minutes . " As you mentioned , it 's a perfect converter  --  it can transform mass into energy , and any energy into mass . " Moriarty grinned . " Naturally that 's impossible and I have figures to prove it . " " I 'm going to get a drink , " Allenson said . " Anyone coming ? " " Best idea of the week , " Micheals said . " I wonder how long it 'll take O'Donnell to get permission to use the bomb . " " If I know politics , " Moriarty said , " too long . " * * * * * The findings of the government scientists were checked by other government scientists . That took a few days . Then Washington wanted to know if there was n't some alternative to exploding an atomic bomb in the middle of New York State . It took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , people had to be evacuated , which took more time . Then orders were made out , and five atomic bombs were checked out of a cache . A patrol rocket was assigned , given orders , and put under General O'Donnell 's command . This took a day more . Finally , the stubby scout rocket was winging its way over New York . From the air , the grayish-black spot was easy to find . Like a festered wound , it stretched between Lake Placid and Elizabethtown , covering Keene and Keene Valley , and lapping at the edges of Jay . The first bomb was released . * * * * * It had been a long wait after the first rich food . The greater radiation of day was followed by the lesser energy of night many times , as the leech ate away the earth beneath it , absorbed the air around it , and grew . Then one day  --  An amazing burst of energy ! Everything was food for the leech , but there was always the possibility of choking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the leech grew frantically , trying to contain the titanic dose . Still small , it quickly reached its overload limit . The strained cells , filled to satiation , were given more and more food . The strangling body built new cells at lightning speed . And  --  It held . The energy was controlled , stimulating further growth . More cells took over the load , sucking in the food . The next doses were wonderfully palatable , easily handled . The leech overflowed its bounds , growing , eating , and growing . That was a taste of real food ! The leech was as near ecstasy as it had ever been . It waited hopefully for more , but no more came . It went back to feeding on the Earth . The energy , used to produce more cells , was soon dissipated . Soon it was hungry again . It would always be hungry . * * * * * O'Donnell retreated with his demoralized men . They camped ten miles from the leech 's southern edge , in the evacuated town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter now and still growing fast . It lay sprawled over the Adirondack Mountains , completely blanketing everything from Saranac Lake to Port Henry , with one edge of it over Westport , in Lake Champlain . Everyone within two hundred miles of the leech was evacuated . General O'Donnell was given permission to use hydrogen bombs , contingent on the approval of his scientists . " What have the bright boys decided ? " O'Donnell wanted to know . He and Micheals were in the living room of an evacuated Schroon Lake house . O'Donnell had made it his new command post . " Why are they hedging ? " O'Donnell demanded impatiently . " The leech has to be blown up quick . What are they fooling around for ? " " They 're afraid of a chain reaction , " Micheals told him . " A concentration of hydrogen bombs might set one up in the Earth 's crust or in the atmosphere . It might do any of half a dozen things . " " Perhaps they 'd like me to order a bayonet attack , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an armchair . He was convinced that the whole method was wrong . The government scientists were being rushed into a single line of inquiry . The pressure on them was so great that they did n't have a chance to consider any other approach but force  --  and the leech thrived on that . Micheals was certain that there were times when fighting fire with fire was not applicable . Fire . Loki , god of fire . And of trickery . No , there was no answer there . But Micheals ' mind was in mythology now , retreating from the unbearable present . Allenson came in , followed by six other men . " Well , " Allenson said , " there 's a damned good chance of splitting the Earth wide open if you use the number of bombs our figures show you need . " " You have to take chances in war , " O'Donnell replied bluntly . " Shall I go ahead ? " Micheals saw , suddenly , that O'Donnell did n't care if he did crack the Earth . The red-faced general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest explosion ever produced by the hand of Man . " Not so fast , " Allenson said . " I 'll let the others speak for themselves . " The general contained himself with difficulty . " Remember , " he said , " according to your own figures , the leech is growing at the rate of twenty feet an hour . " " And speeding up , " Allenson added . " But this is n't a decision to be made in haste . " Micheals found his mind wandering again , to the lightning bolts of Zeus . That was what they needed . Or the strength of Hercules . Or  --  He sat up suddenly . " Gentlemen , I believe I can offer you a possible alternative , although it 's a very dim one . " They stared at him . " Have you ever heard of Antaeus ? " he asked . * * * * * The more the leech ate , the faster it grew and the hungrier it became . Although its birth was forgotten , it did remember a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ancient past . Grown tremendous , ravenous , it had made the journey to a nearby star and eaten that , replenishing the cells converted into energy for the trip . But then there was no more food , and the next star was an enormous distance away . It set out on the journey , but long before it reached the food , its energy ran out . Mass , converted back to energy to make the trip , was used up . It shrank . Finally , all the energy was gone . It was a spore , drifting aimlessly , lifelessly , in space . That was the first time . Or was it ? It thought it could remember back to a distant , misty time when the Universe was evenly covered with stars . It had eaten through them , cutting away whole sections , growing , swelling . And the stars had swung off in terror , forming galaxies and constellations . Or was that a dream ? Methodically , it fed on the Earth , wondering where the rich food was . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leech . It waited , but the tantalizing food remained out of reach . It was able to sense how rich and pure the food was . Why did n't it fall ? For a long time the leech waited , but the food stayed out of reach . At last , it lifted and followed . The food retreated , up , up from the surface of the planet . The leech went after as quickly as its bulk would allow . The rich food fled out , into space , and the leech followed . Beyond , it could sense an even richer source . The hot , wonderful food of a sun ! * * * * * O'Donnell served champagne for the scientists in the control room . Official dinners would follow , but this was the victory celebration . " A toast , " the general said , standing . The men raised their glasses . The only man not drinking was a lieutenant , sitting in front of the control board that guided the drone spaceship . " To Micheals , for thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antaeus . " Micheals had been drinking champagne steadily , but he did n't feel elated . Antaeus , born of Ge , the Earth , and Poseidon , the Sea . The invincible wrestler . Each time Hercules threw him to the ground , he arose refreshed . Until Hercules held him in the air . Moriarty was muttering to himself , figuring with slide rule , pencil and paper . Allenson was drinking , but he did n't look too happy about it . " Come on , you birds of evil omen , " O'Donnell said , pouring more champagne . " Figure it out later . Right now , drink . " He turned to the operator . " How 's it going ? " Micheals ' analogy had been applied to a spaceship . The ship , operated by remote control , was filled with pure radioactives . It hovered over the leech until , rising to the bait , it had followed . Antaeus had left his mother , the Earth , and was losing his strength in the air . The operator was allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leech 's grasp , but close enough to keep it coming . The spaceship and the leech were on a collision course with the Sun . " Fine , sir , " the operator said . " It 's inside the orbit of Mercury now . " " Men , " the general said , " I swore to destroy that thing . This is n't exactly the way I wanted to do it . I figured on a more personal way . But the important thing is the destruction . You will all witness it . Destruction is at times a sacred mission . This is such a time . Men , I feel wonderful . " " Turn the spaceship ! " It was Moriarty who had spoken . His face was white . " Turn the damned thing ! " He shoved his figures at them . They were easy to read . The growth-rate of the leech . The energy-consumption rate , estimated . Its speed in space , a constant . The energy it would receive from the Sun as it approached , an exponential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , expressed as a hyped-up discontinuous progression . The result  --  " It 'll consume the Sun , " Moriarty said , very quietly . The control room turned into a bedlam . Six of them tried to explain it to O'Donnell at the same time . Then Moriarty tried , and finally Allenson . " Its rate of growth is so great and its speed so slow  --  and it will get so much energy  --  that the leech will be able to consume the Sun by the time it gets there . Or , at least , to live off it until it can consume it . " O'Donnell did n't bother to understand . He turned to the operator . " Turn it , " he said . They all hovered over the radar screen , waiting . * * * * * The food turned out of the leech 's path and streaked away . Ahead was a tremendous source , but still a long way off . The leech hesitated . Its cells , recklessly expending energy , shouted for a decision . The food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater ? The leech 's body wanted food now . It started after it , away from the Sun . The Sun would come next . * * * * * " Pull it out at right angles to the plane of the Solar System , " Allenson said . The operator touched the controls . On the radar screen , they saw a blob pursuing a dot . It had turned . Relief washed over them . It had been close ! " In what portion of the sky would the leech be ? " O'Donnell asked , his face expressionless . " Come outside ; I believe I can show you , " an astronomer said . They walked to the door . " Somewhere in that section , " the astronomer said , pointing . " Fine . All right , Soldier , " O'Donnell told the operator . " Carry out your orders . " The scientists gasped in unison . The operator manipulated the controls and the blob began to overtake the dot . Micheals started across the room . " Stop , " the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know what I 'm doing . I had that ship especially built . " The blob overtook the dot on the radar screen . " I told you this was a personal matter , " O'Donnell said . " I swore to destroy that leech . We can never have any security while it lives . " He smiled . " Shall we look at the sky ? " The general strolled to the door , followed by the scientists . " Push the button , Soldier ! " The operator did . For a moment , nothing happened . Then the sky lit up ! A bright star hung in space . Its brilliance filled the night , grew , and started to fade . " What did you do ? " Micheals gasped . " That rocket was built around a hydrogen bomb , " O'Donnell said , his strong face triumphant . " I set it off at the contact moment . " He called to the operator again . " Is there anything showing on the radar ? " " Not a speck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have met the enemy and he is mine . Let 's have some more champagne . " But Micheals found that he was suddenly ill. * * * * * It had been shrinking from the expenditure of energy , when the great explosion came . No thought of containing it . The leech 's cells held for the barest fraction of a second , and then spontaneously overloaded . The leech was smashed , broken up , destroyed . It was split into a thousand particles , and the particles were split a million times more . The particles were thrown out on the wave front of the explosion , and they split further , spontaneously . Into spores . The spores closed into dry , hard , seemingly lifeless specks of dust , billions of them , scattered , drifting . Unconscious , they floated in the emptiness of space . Billions of them , waiting to be fed .  --  PHILLIPS BARBEE
