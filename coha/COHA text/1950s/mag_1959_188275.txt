EDMUND TABELL <P> TO predict the course of the stock market , Wall Streeters have tried everything from the height of tides to the frequency of sunspots . The most practical tools are charts that show the price changes of individual stocks as well as the action of the market as a whole . Chartists are powers in the Street ; on what their charts show , institutions , mutual funds and thousands of individual investors buy and sell . In this select group of experts , who can often send a stock zipping up-or down - the leading chartist is generally recognized to be Edmund W. Tabell , 55 , the tall ( 6 ft. 2 in. ) , mustached vice president and research director of Walston &; Co . Tabell keeps 2,500 charts , biggest number on Wall Street , has used them to score a topflight record in predicting market swings . Says Samuel L. Stedman , partner of Carl M. Loeb , Rhoades &; Co. : " Ed Tabell is the best bird dog on the Street . When he points , you better look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing up . In 1948 , when the Dow-Jones industrials were around 180 and Wall Street was expecting a drop , Tabell predicted an intermediate rise to 250 , a rise to 450 by the mid-1950s . In the 1953 recession downturn , Tabell wrote that " this is the last buying opportunity " before a market rise that would " break through the 1929 top of 386 and carry to the 500-600 level by the late 1950s . " In 1957 he predicted the market , then around 500 , could work down to 430 ( it hit 419.79 ) . Later he noted , " The bull market is good for another two years . " <P> WHAT Tabell uses chiefly in judging the market is his 1,400 " point and figure " charts of individual stocks . For the complete technical picture he also charts daily market volume , number of issues traded , new highs and lows , and odd-lot trading . For point-and-figure charts ( also used by other chartists ) he notes each change of a point or more in a stock ( point if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus established , he determines whether a stock is going to move straight up or down or merely back and fill . In an upward move , he forecasts the " objective , " i.e. , the price at which the stock should be sold . In a move down , he forecasts the level where it should be bought . <P> The reason why charts can predict a rise , says he , is a simple one . " When the top officers know that a company has taken a turn for the better , they start buying the stock themselves , or tell their friends . This buying shows up on the chart . As a new pattern forms , it is not hard to project what the stock should do . " <P> A year ago , when American Motors was seesawing between 11 and 14 , Tabell noticed what he calls a " strong technical pattern , " predicted an " upside potential " of 34 if the stock got above 14 . When it did rise , leveling off around 34 , Tabell 's chart showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as 43 ? by January , then slid back to 25 before climbing back to 38 last week . Tabell admits that charts are far from infallible ; often two chartists will arrive at opposite conclusions . Therefore , when a stock attracts Tabell 's attention by its price movements , he sends aides to see the company and check on the " fundamentals " of earnings , sales and dividends . He will not recommend a stock unless the fundamentals support the pattern on his charts .
