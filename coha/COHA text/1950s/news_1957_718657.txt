txt Governor Harriman approved today continuation this year of the personal income tax reduction granted last year . In signing a Republican bill to make the cut applicable to returns due next April 15 , Mr. Harriman noted that the measure was identical with one he had submitted with his budget . The bill allows a taxpayer to claim a credit of 15 per cent on the first $100 of tax due and 10 per cent on the next $200 . The maximum credit that any one taxpayer can claim is $35 . The reduction involves a drop of about $40,000,000 in state revenue . Mr. Harriman has still to act on two other tax reduction bills that have been approved by the Republican - controlled Legislature . State to Lose Revenue One would allow a reduction similar to the personal income tax cut to those liable for the unincorporated business tax plus a flat $5 credit to all corporations subject only to the minimum $25 filing fee . The other would grant an additional $400 exemption , starting next year , to parents of college students over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would be applicable to returns due this year  --  would involve a $1,650,000 cut in revenue . The extra college student exemption , applicable to next year 's returns , involves a revenue loss of about $3,200,000 . Shortly after the Governor had acted , George M. Bragalini , chairman of the State Tax Commission , issued instructions to taxpayers on how to claim the income tax credit . He issued also a series of instructions on how taxpayers could take advantage of the ' " humanizing amendments " to the personal income tax law . These amendments were enacted last year but become effective ' for the first time on returns due April 15 this year . Mr. Bragalini said it would not be necessary for taxpayers who have already filed to make any claims for returns . These will be made automatically by his department . Taxpayers using the short form return ( IT-200 ) , should enter the normal tax online 8 on the face of the form , compute their credits and enter the amount of the reduction on line 9a . This amount should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance , constituting the net tax , entered at . line 9c . Those wing the long form ; ' return ( IT-201 ) should enter . their gross tax , including anyj capital gains on line 18 of , Page 1 of the form . The amount of the reduction should be en-1 tered at line 19a . After subtra.c-1 tion the net amount of tax due should be entered at line 19c . Nonresident Instructions On nonresident returns ( IT203 ) , , the reduction is entered at line 18a , which should be subtracted from the amount on line 18 and the balance entered at line 18b . The humanizing amendments approved last year grant extra exemptions to those over 65 years old and to the blind . They provide also a new " child care " allowance in some cases and permit more ' liberal deductions for medical expenses . Commissioner Bragalini explained that the new exemptions for those who are blind or older than 65 were in addition to the ordinary exemptions of $1,000 for a single person and ' $2,500 for a married couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' each dependent , except the first in " the case of a " head of family . " This year a new ' deduction of up- to $400 for one dependent or up to $800 for two . or more dependents can , be claimed for money spent for the care of the dependents while . the taxpayer was at work or in search of work . The amount of the deduction , must-be reduced by the amount the taxpayer 's gross income ' exceeds $6,000 . The tax-1 payer must also be able to prove he spent the money . To qualify as a deduction , the dependent for whose care the money was spent must be ' less than 12 years , of age , or physically or mentally incapable of car- ' ing for ' himself . Under the new medical provisions , a taxpayer can deduct expenditures ? exceeding 3 per cent of the first $6,000 of his net income and exceeding 5 per cent of any . excess of net income over , $6,000 : Under the old law , only the amount exceeding 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection net income means gross income less other deductions but not exemptions . The new law also raised the maximum that could be deducted for medical expense to $2,500 for a married couple and $1,250 for a single taxpayer . The old limits were $1,500 and $750 , respectively .
