txt First quarter sales and net of Carborundum Co. will run " well below " the like period of 1957 , when $1,488,614 , equal to 85 cents a common share , was earned on sales of $27,673,350 , Gen. Clinton F. Robinson , president , told The Wall Street Journal . He disclosed sales in the first two months this year were approximately $15.5 million , or nearly 15% below the $18.2 million a year earlier . He declined to disclose any earnings figures for the early months of 1958 but said , " You can assume that percentagewise they 've dropped a bit more sharply than sales . " " In two of our divisions , there are slight indications we may have hit bottom , but it 's too little to hang our hats on , so we 're not going to say that the worst is over yet , " he commented . Gen. Robinson noted , for example , that the big grinding wheels division had an upturn in volume the first 10 days of March , amounting to about 20% when compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months this year , grinding wheel sales ran 35% behind 1957 . He added that sale of some smaller segments of the business actually have been running ahead , of a year ago , including zirconium , most of which goes to the Government for atomic reactors . The company 's 40-cents quarterly dividend payment on the common stock is safely assured for this year . " unless things get an awful lot worse , " he said . About 40% of Carborundum 's total sales in the past have gone to the automotive , machinery and iron and steel industries , all of which are depressed . Abrasives products , such as grinding wheels and sand paper , make up about two-thirds of company volume . In picturing the decline in business , Gen. Robinson recalled sales held up well  --  much better than expected  --  until the middle of last December . " Then the incoming order rate started to go down precipitously , " he said . Carborundum had record sales of $111,206 , - 440 last year , up from $104,873,499 in 1958 , but net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common share , from $8,327,758 , or $3.68 , in 1956 . Last year 's net was trimmed by a strike in the first quarter at the Perth Amboy , N.7. , refractories plant , and also higher manufacturing and administrative costs . Despite the business downturn , Gen. Robinson said Carborundum has n't changed its thinking about the promising outlook for the future and its capital spending program so far has been unscathed . He said the company has budgeted nearly $14 million for capital spending this year , up from $10.2 million in 1957.
