Like a million other South Africans , the Stoltz family was up at cockcrow one morning last week , all ready to cast its votes in the first general election since 1948 . Grandpa Stoltz , 75 , stumped out to the car that would take his household to the polls at Nigel , a dusty gold-mining town 25 miles southeast of Johannesburg ; as he reached the car there was a roar , and his house blew to smithereens . Grandma Elizabeth Stoltz and a 32-year-old gold miner named Lukas van der Merwe lay dead in the wreckage ; the Stoltzes ' son Pieter had a leg blown off . <P> What caused the blast was an unexploded shell that had stood in the Rand dust outside the Stoltzes ' door for half a century-since some unknown cannoneer had misfired or forgotten it in the far-off Boer War ( 1899-1902 ) . To the long-memoried Afrikaners who back Prime Minister Daniel Malan , that war is still as explosive as the shell that killed Grannie Stoltz . Last week , at the polls , they went far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boer nationalism was in fact the issue , though most of the noise was about apartheid-the religiously held dogma that 2,600,000 whites ( Boer and Briton ) should rule four times their number of blacks , half-whites and browns . Malan 's racial stand was strident : " This is South Africa 's last chance to remain a white man 's country . Our aim is to safeguard the purity of the white race . " His special strength lay on the veldt , among the Afrikaans-speaking farmers whose fathers had conquered the blacks only to see their early Boer Republic snuffed out by British imperialism . Egged on by predikants ( ministers ) of the Dutch Reformed Church , the Nationalists made gory predictions of Mau Mau-style massacres to come , of " Godfearing white girls " forced to marry " coons . " <P> Lost in the political wilderness since the death of its inspirer , Jan Smuts , the opposition United Party fought back with hot charges that Malan threatens democracy and mocks the rule of law . " Vote now , " was their slogan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party Leader Jacobus Gideon Strauss , who was once Smuts 's secretary , accused Malan 's Nationalists of provoking racial strife , but labored hard to show that he could not be accused of undue sympathy for the Negro . " Of all races and colors , " said he , " the black Africans have failed to contribute to man 's progress . . . They must work their passage , not try for short cuts . " <P> No More Legalism . The Negroes , seven-tenths of the population , had no votes at all ; only 48,000 half-castes were eligible to vote . And even among the whites who did vote , Malan got less than a majority-but he won a sweeping electoral victory . From dorps ( villages ) and the poor-white slums of the Rand , his Nationalist supporters flocked to the polls to keep the land " pure " of " black barbarism " and " British legalism . " Of South Africa 's 1,600,000 voters , 86% voted : 640,000 for Daniel Malan , 760,000 against him . <P>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
