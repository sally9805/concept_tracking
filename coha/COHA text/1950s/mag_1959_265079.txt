The London Times feared that the upstart invasion might unbalance the ancient fortress of classical learning , and one frosty don complained that another half-thousand bicycles would clog the university town 's streets beyond unsnarling . But last week , despite the serious reservations of some scholars , Cambridge University took the first formal step toward the admission of a new residential college , to be devoted chiefly to science . The new college will be named for one of its originators , Sir Winston Churchill . <P> First master of Churchill College will be Sir John Cockcroft , founder and head of Britain 's atomic research center at Harwell . His qualifications are impressive : in 1932 , while working at Cambridge under Lord Rutherford , he and Physicist E.T.S. Walton earned a Nobel Prize for pioneer work in splitting lithium atoms . Behind Sir Winston and Sir John in the project are many of Britain 's industrial leaders , who have given most of the $8,000,000 already collected toward the $11 million the college is expected to cost .

Churchill College would add 600 scholars-70% of them scientists-to the 8,500-student university . A hit-or-miss poll of 500 Cantabrigians showed 52% against the addition . Literary Scholar Eustace Tillyard , master of Jesus College , called the plan " pernicious , " added with scorn and resignation that ' ' mere flesh and blood do not reject the bait of a million pounds odd , nor does common human decency care to incur the odium " of insulting Sir Winston . Last week , while opponents kept a sullen silence , invitations were sent to 20 architects to compete for the honor of designing the new seat of science . <P> With less fuss , Oxford went about its own plans for a $7,000,000 science college .
