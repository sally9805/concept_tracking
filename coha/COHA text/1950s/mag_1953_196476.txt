THE CLOSED HARBOR ( 315 pp. ) - James Hanley-Horizon ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> If critics ' raves paid their way in royalties , a 52-year-old Irishman named James Hanley might well be one of the richest authors alive . When his novel , The Closed Harbor , appeared in Britain last year , Fellow Novelist Henry Green said of Hanley : " He is far and away the best writer of the sea and of seafaring men since Conrad , and indeed in my opinion is much superior to him . " Said the Times Literary Supplement : " One of his greatest achievements-and of their kind there are none superior . " This is a fair sample of what the critics have been saying about Novelist Hanley for two decades . The Closed Harbor goes far in explaining why he wins book reviewers more readily than book buyers . <P> Its story is as simple and deadly as the flight of a poisoned arrow . Its hero is Marius , a French sea captain who has lost his master 's ticket for running a merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whom rumor accuses of some greater , vaguer crime . By day he haunts the shipping offices of Marseille in his greasy old captain 's uniform , cringing and wheedling for another command . By night he gets roaring drunk and tries to check his conscience and his failure at the local brothel . <P> Betweentimes he must face two other judges : a mother as implacable as Madame Defarge who exchanges not a word with him , feeling that his comedown has smirched his father 's name ( a World War I naval hero ) , and a sister whose eyes still sting with grief at the death of her only son on Marius ' lost ship . How strong the case against Marius really is becomes clear when , in a drunk and fitful sleep , he blurts out that he murdered his nephew for siding with the first mate just before his ship went to the bottom . <P> By this time , Marius ' own end is in sight . His mind cracks . In the novel 's closing scenes , grim as any in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clear away aft ... let go for'ard " ) and mistakes his mother for his favorite brothel companion . Unmoved , smugly vengeful , she gloats : " God has drawn down the blind . That is only just ... He is overthrown and that is just . " <P> By keeping the emotional wringer pressed morbidly tight , Novelist Hanley sometimes squeezes life as well as mercy out of his story . Powerful though it is , The Closed Harbor never quite proves its intended point , that the perdition of Marius is the condition of man .
