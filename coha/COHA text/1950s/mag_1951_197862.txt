The Atlanta Constitution and Executive Editor Ralph McGill buckled down to work 13 years ago to drive the Ku Klux Klan out of Georgia . The Constitution repeatedly headlined hooded assault and fiery cross burnings , prodded lethargic cops into jailing several of the ringleaders , kept up a constant drumfire of ridicule . When Indiana Veterinarian James A. Colescott was chosen Imperial Wizard of the Klan , Editor McGill wrote : " For the first time the Klan has chosen a proper man , a veterinarian skilled in dealing with dumb animals . " <P> The Klan fought back . Hooded Klans men paraded around the Constitution building , sent the Constitution and McGill letters filled with threats and abuse . <P> Slowly the Constitution , joined by the Atlanta Journal and most of Georgia 's other dailies and weeklies , made headway . A bill was introduced into the state legislature two years ago to ban the wearing of masks , but was defeated by an 89-65 vote . <P> Last week the Constitution and the other papers won a complete victory . Georgia 's Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which banned the whole paraphernalia of hooded terror . <P> In celebrating its victory , the Constitution had some sharp things to say about he way Northern newspapers had covered the fight . When the first bill was debated , said McGill , the story was given front-page play in the North . Last week , after thumbing through 30 Northern newspapers , McGill angrily wrote : " Let anything suggestive of Ku Klux Klan violence happen in Georgia or the South nd the Northern and Eastern papers are certain to give it front-page play and bitter editorial condemnation . But we have searched in vain for comment on ... passage of the antimask bill , which . . . signals the death and burial of the Klan nd its code in Georgia ... It is much easier to criticize than to praise . "
