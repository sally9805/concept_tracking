The Seven Dictators of Broadway T he final curtain has just dropped on a new Broadway play and now the tension mounting backstage is more suspenseful than it was in the make-believe behind the footlights . Realistic professionals know the fate of the play rests squarely on the reactions of only seven men who were in the theater . Now come two hours of harrowing waiting for the verdicts of New York 's drama critics . Sharply at 12:30 A.m. the first twenty-five copies of The New York Times ' late city edition arc rushed next door to Sardi 's Restaurant , the nerve center of the theater . Three minutes later the Herald Tribune arrives , followed closely by the News and the Mirror . Although the Post , World-Telegram and Journal-American will not be out for ten hours , the consensus of the morning pundits generally is decisive . Now , at 12:40 A.M. , it is known whether the actors will be making the rounds of casting offices shortly and the producer will have to dig up a fresh bank roll for walking-around money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the public at the box office in less than 5 per cent of the plays brought to Broadway . Eminent people in the theater have denounced the intelligence , competence and ancestry of the men who pass judgment on their creative efforts , but they invariably concede that the influence of the critics never was stronger than it is today . " When I start to work on a play I tell myself I 'm producing this for only seven men , " says Herman Shumlin , a successful showman for more than a quarter century . " Throughout rehearsals and tryouts on the road , everyone is obsessed by one thought : Will the New York critics like it ? On opening night I do n't care if the actors ca n't be heard in the balcony . I want them to play to those seven men sitting down front in the orchestra . " There is no question that the critics can make or break a play . A musical is one exception . It can be a hit with fair notices if it has a big star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the critics are qualified to evaluate acting and direction . Their lack of appreciation for artistic experiments has hurt the theater , because people are afraid to invest in such projects . I suppose , though , that 's a left-handed tribute to the power the critics exert . " Actually , the influence of the New York drama critics extends far beyond the narrow limits of Broadway . Most original plays that survive for two months eventually wind up in the movies or on television if they do not violate racial , moral or sex taboos . Alan Jackson , story editor of Paramount Pictures , checked the list of twenty-four offerings on the boards during the second week in January . Nineteen already had been bought by the movies or were in the bidding stage . Of the remaining five , one was a musical without a suitable plot , two were closing after short runs , another was a flimsy comedy about a Jewish family , and the last was a Shakespearean repertory presented by the Old Vic Company of London . Who are the seven autocrats upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually in Broadway shows ? Well , sir , a composite biography reveals that none was born or reared within 200 miles of Broadway , all have covered general newspaper assignments from crime to clambakes and , to a man , they are carrying on a violent love affair sith the theater . In order of seniority , the critics are : Brooks Atkinson , The Times ' man on the aisle since 1925 , is the counterpart of the urbane , reflective New Englander . A devotee of pipes , bow ties , bird watching and Thoreau , he brushes off mediocrity ith the tolerance born of 2000 opening nights , but sends up Roman candles for something with genuine merit . Was a distinguished foreign correspondent in China and Russia during World War II . Richard Watts . Jr , , of the Post , an ebullient native of West Virginia , began reviewing plays at Columbia University forty years ago and still tracks down off-Broadway and amateur productions when there is no other wheel in town . Berates vulgarity , phony pretentiousness and slipshod effort . Also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the News , son of a famous Denver newspaperman , has covered every conceivable beat as a reporter , photographer and columnist . Runs a high fever for worth-while plays , but throws the harpoons into rubbish with equal gusto . A knowledgeable student of music , he is rated the No . I man in appraising musical shows . Robert Coleman , of the Mirror , a gregarious Georgian , is suspected of being a frustrated actor . Plumps for the classics and works in blank verse , sometimes to the bewilderment of his tabloid readers . John McClain , of the Journal-American , born in Marion , Ohio , first made a reputation as a ship-news reporter . Graduated to the drama by way of a Broadway column and a stretch of screen writing in Hollywood . Has forbearance of bad acting , but gives bad writing a hard time . Walter Kerr , of the Herald Tribune , from Evanston , Illinois , is generally regarded as the most perceptive critic who has come up in the last thirty years . Gives fewer favorable reviews than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firmly believes there has not been a playwright since Shakespeare worth preserving . The only critic in the group who has worked in the commercial theater , he was represented on Broadway by two moderately successful musicals . Directed King of Hearts , co-authored by his wife , which ran for eight months in 1954 and further enriched the Kerrs beyond the dreams of a newspaperman 's avarice by serving as a movie vehicle for Bob Hope under the title of That Certain Feeling . Tom Donnelly , of the World-Telegram , arrived on Broadway last May via Syracuse and Washington . Unawed by the glamour of the big leagues , he does a sound job of blackballing dull and muddled plays . The foregoing thumbnail sketches suggest that blasting is the critics ' favorite pastime , but it is not a studied pose . They simply have more to rap than to praise . At that , they arc much kinder than the public to shoddy stuff , Variety , the trade paper of show business , keeps an annual tabulation on the critics and has found that favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and large , the critics are very lenient , " Elia Kazan , the noted director , says . " They 're exposed to so much tripe that they 're inclined to go overboard when something halfway decent comes along . They 're a fine hunch of men who are genuinely concerned with the theater . " Kazan 's bow to the critics marks a complete reversal of attitude since 1946 , when he figured prominently in a bitter attack on them . The whole thing was a melancholy commentary on human nature , for , like most outbursts , it came from recipients of the critics ' highest commendation . The hassle was touched off by the reviews of Maxwell Anderson 's Truckline Cafe , the target for the heaviest bombs ever dropped on a major playwright 's work . Anderson had been awarded the first two Critics Circle awards for Winterset and High Tor , but Chapman called Truckline Caf ? " the worst play I have seen since I have been in the reviewing business , " and his colleagues went on from there . Kazan and Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Times denouncing the critics as men " acquiring powers which , as a group , they are not qualified to exercise , either by their training or by their taste . " The producers bought two More big ads appealing to the public to support the play , but it folded after thirteen performances . Anderson got into the act with his own ad in the Herald Tribune on March 4 , 1946 . He has written many eloquent speeches for the theater , but the ad carried a passage that is remembered as his most famous line . Anderson reviled the critics as " the Jukes family of journalists who bring to the theater nothing but their own hopelessness , recklessness and despair . " There is a sequel to the story never divulged before . Nine months later , Anderson still was so Sore at the critics that he ordered Bill Fields , his press agent , to withhold their tickets for the opening of Joan of Lorraine , starring Ingrid Bergman . Anticipating that the critics would try to buy tickets , Anderson supervised the distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheme at the last moment . The critics got their passes , Joan of Lorraine got raves , and the show played to packed houses until Miss Bergman left to fulfill a movie committment . We now flash hack to Kazan 's nice send-oil to the critics . I asked him how it squared with his harsh words in the Truckline Cafe ad . He grinned amiably . " You 've got me in a box . The only way I can wriggle out is to say a different crew was covering shows then . Atkinson and Watts were away during the war and Kerr was n't doing reviews . Maybe the blasts against Truckline were justified , but I do n't regret the ad . I still think the show deserved more credit for what it tried to say . " The passing years have not appeased Elmer Rice , whose Pulitzer Prize-winning Street Scene was acclaimed by the press in 1928 . On November I1 , 1934 , Rice also took an ad in the Times , to vent his spleen against the critics after his two latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worlds  --  had achieved runs of only six and four weeks , respectively . " For the most part they are men without intellect , perception , sensitivity OF background , " Rice fulminated . " They pander to the tastes of the empty-headed , the bored , the insensitive and the complacent . " While preparing this article I phoned Rice and asked whether I could see him for his current views on the critics . " If you do n't mind , I refuse to be quoted on the subject , " he answered . Just a moment , please . Had his opinion of them changed since 1934 ? " I will not discuss it , " he said , and hung up . Producers have threatened to bar caustic commentators , but only the Shubert brothers , who own half of the thirty-two legitimate theaters in New York , have gone through with it . Walter Winchell , once excluded , was restored to good standing , but Leonard Lyons , another columnist , and Variety have been on the Shubert blacklist for more than twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives them opening-night tickets under phony names , and the Shuberts know it , " Bill Fields confides . " The reason for the ban has been forgotten , but the Shuberts still keep the feuds alive . " More direct retaliation  --  such as a punch in the nose  --  undoubtedly has been contemplated by a host of indignant artists , but diligent research reveals only one such reprisal against a critic . Nearly twenty years ago , Jack Kirkland hauled off on Dick Watts , his old college chum , for a review of Tortilla Flat , which he had adapted for the stage . A safer device for taking digs at the critics is to depict them on the stage as eccentrics missing a few ma rbles . A sketch in Make Mine Manhattan showed a newspaper publisher interviewing one Lester Jukes , an obvious cretin , who was applying for a job as a drama critic . In presenting his qualifications , it developed that Jukes was almost totally deaf and blind and that he loathed the theater , " Just the man for the job ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sportsmanship by calling the sketch a high spot in the revue . Whenever theatrical people pan the critics  --  a highly popular diversion  --  someone is sure to mention their fallibility as forecasters . The prize exhibit always offered is Abie 's Irish Rose , which piled up 2327 performances over a five-year run , then an all-time record . Old-timers assure you the critics unanimously roasted the plot dealing with the marriage of an Irish Catholic girl to a Jewish boy over the violent objections of both families , who subsequently were reconciled when twins were born to the young couple . The reviews of May 23 , 1922 , refute the trumped-up yarn . There were twenty-one daily papers in New York then , and seventeen gave the play raves . Another legend is that Tobacco Road , in second place on the long-run list , was bitterly condemned by all the critics for its emphasis on vulgarity and sex . Nonsense . They did object to that aspect of the show , but the overwhelming majority called it an honest , vivid and moving piece of playwriting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play a better reception than its creator dared to anticipate . Russel Crouse , co-author of the practically im perishable Life With Father , tells a revealing anecdote in this vein . " Howard Lindsay , my collaborator , who also played the leading role , was in an expansive mood coming up on the train from Baltimore for the New York opening , " Crouse relates . " ' I think that we 're in pretty good shape , ' he said cautiously . ' We may get a full season out of this. ? Atkinson 's review led off with an uncanny prophecy : " Sooner or later , everyone will have to see Life With Father . " The play set the all-time record with 3224 performances in a continuous run of eight years , grossed 59,908,000 on Broadway and the road , and the authors ' share of the movie profits amounted to another $1,600.000 . Through the years , a rule of thumb has held true for fully 95 per cent of Broadway shows . Thumbs up from the critics means success , thumbs down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune to a critic 's scorn . Tallulah Bank-head has not had a go at Shakespeare anywhere since John Mason Brown commented in 1937 : " Tallulah Bankhead barged down the Nile as Cleopatra last night  --  and sank . " The kiss of death to The Lake was Dorothy Parker 's devastating crack : " Katharine Hepburn ran the gamut of emotions from A to B. " When Mae West appeared in Catherine Was Great , John Chapman dismissed the opus with the observation that " the play is a bust , which is one more than Miss West needs . " The shortest review on record was Robert Garland 's report on Heads or Tails . It consisted of one word : " No ! " As previously noted , virtually all ex-motions to the rule are musicals . Mr. Wonderful , a revue , was murdered when it opened in March , 1956 , and hung on for eleven months . The critics sadly reported that Cole Porter , who had written some sixty shows , most of them great , hit a clinker in Can-Can , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar run despite a rough going-over . " People who go to musicals are n't typical theatergoers , " John McClain explains . " They 're mostly tourists and guys on expense accounts who get a little loaded and want to look at pretty girls , If corporations were not allowed to claim the entertainment of clients as a tax-deductible expense , four out of five musicals would n't last a month . " The only serious drama in the last decade that became a smash hit after unanimously unfavorable reviews was The Heiress . Conversely , a handful of highly recommended plays lay large eggs every season . Careful reading of the reviews discloses , however , that the critics gave warning that the plays were on the arty side and would have a limited appeal . The disturbing realization that so much creative effort and money hinge on his opinion prompts every critic except Chapman to disclaim the influence attributed to him . " I 'd sleep a lot better many nights if nobody read me after I 've torn down a play some poor wretch has written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Unhappily and unfortunately , two out of three bad notices from Atkinson , Kerr and me can kill a show . The prestige of our papers , not our personal opinion , is important . When Lewis Nichols replaced Atkinson during the war , he automatically became the big man in town because the Times is the Number One paper . " Atkinson , weary of debating the issue , keeps in his desk copies of a column he wrote in 1953 , arguing that the theatergoer makes the final decision on a play . Kerr hews to the same line . " The frightening power we 're supposed to wield is exaggerated , " he declares . Hobe Morrison , drama editor of Variety , probably is best qualified to evaluate the critics ' influence . " People unquestionably are paying more attention to their advice today than ever before , " he says . " They want guaranteed hits , and maybe you ca n't blame them . The price of tickets has gone up about fifty per cent in the last ten years , but production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no such thing as a moderate success any more , Years ago a low-budget play that got lukewarm notices could hang on and build up on word-of-mouth recommendation . If a show does n't click immediately now , the terrific competition for theaters will force it to close in two weeks . " Investing in a Broadway show always has been a bad gamble . In any given season there are three flops for every hit , and the odds against making money are getting longer all the time . With rising costs putting a triple squeeze on audiences . producers and theaters , a show is dead if the critics do n't like it . " The competition for theaters mentioned by Morrison is an economic factor that requires brief explanation for laymen . It further underscores the importance of the critics ' impact on the public . In 1927 there were seventy-five playhouses on Broadway . Today there are thirty-two ; the remainder have been converted into movies and TV studios or have been razed for office buildings . The decline in the number of theaters has resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , 264 productions were presented on Broadway . This season there will be about seventy . More plays are written now than ever before , but the great majority ( Continued on Page 90 ) are gathering dust in filing cabinets for lack of available stages . Here 's how the shortage of theaters brings sudden death to a show that gets off to a limping start . The customary rental charged for an attraction is 30 per cent of the weekly gross receipts , in return for which the landlord pays for part of the advertising and provides the theater staff as well as sonic stagehands and musicians . The gimmick in the lease is a stop clause . This gives the landlord the right to throw out a play the first or second week it fails to gross a specified sum about 816,000 for a drama and 830,000 for a , musical . That 's a lot of money at the box office if the reviews are indifferent . The landlord unhesitantly invokes the stop clause because there always are other shows in the wings clamoring to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by the gripe that the dopey critics did n't appreciate its message or cultural values . Another common grievance is that a critic abuses his authority when he foists his personal opinions and prejudices on readers . " One man ca n't set himself up as the composite audience , " Herman Shumlin contends . " 1 do n't think anyone should advise the public whether a play is good or bad . " What , then , is the proper function of a drama critic ? George Bernard Shaw , once an illustrious member of the lodge , said " a critic is a man who leaves no turn unstoned . " Percy Hammond defined his work as " the venom from contented rattlesnakes . " And thundering down the corridors of time is the harsh impeachment of an unknown eighteenth-century actor : " Theatrical criticism is the occupation of a poltroon . " Brooks Atkinson , the dean of the profession , sums up his colleagues ' viewpoint : " I 'm strictly a newspaper reporter covering a beat . The chief difference between another assignment and mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . I do n't try to reflect mass opinion . I 'm paid to express only my own reaction . " This may sound pompous , but there is no other way the job can be done . Only one criterion can be applied to is play : Am I moved , amused or emotionally involved by this thing ? I have little control over the answer . It is governed by the power transmitted from the stage . " Old Broadway hands register another complaint against today 's critics which really is a compliment , although it is not intended as one , " Reviews now are dull compared with the sprightly stuff turned out years ago , " Shumlin says . " Nobody is writing with the verve of Alec Wooll cott , Bob Benchley , Heywood Broun , Dorothy Parker , George Jean Nathan and Percy Hammond . When Woollcom liked a play he infected the whole town with his enthusiasm . His judgment often was faulty , but when he used his favorite line , ' There is dancing in the streets today because such-and-such opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the theater . " Shumlin has a point , but it is something less than fair to measure the literary quality of reviews written in the 1920 's and the 1950 's by the same yardstick . Critics today have to contend with a much tougher deadline . Oddly enough , they have been under greater pressure to dash of their pieces ever since the opening-night curtain was advanced from 8:30 or 8:45 P.M , to eight o'clock a dozen years ago . The change was made ostensibly to enable people living in the suburbs to get home at a reasonable hour . " Sordid propaganda , " snorts Richard Maney , a press agent . " It was done entirely to catch more editions of the morning papers . " Under the present system , morning-paper critics get out of the theater at 10:30 P.M. By the time they reach their offices , they have little more than an hour to make a 12:15 deadline with a 400-to-800-word review that digests the plot of the play , analyzes the performances and interprets the author 's philosophy , if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Parker , Benchley and Nathan wrote for magazines and had a week to compose their essays . Woollcott , Broun and Hammond were on newspapers , but they had some four or five hours to meet different schedules . The Herald Tribune gave Hammond special dispensation to take all the time he wanted to rewrite and polish his phrases . That and a superb gift for words made him the most quotable drama critic since Shaw . In his closing remarks on a musical , Hammond wrote : " I have knocked everything in the show except the knees of the chorus girls , and God has anticipated me there . " Unimpressed by the allure of the stately show girls featured in the Ziegfeld Follies , he observed : " Dusk brunettes and sparkling sorrels dance and utter lines almost as human beings . " Hammond , who recognized no sacred cows , led off his review of Mourning Becomes Electra in this fashion : " From four o'clock yesterday afternoon until eleven at night , Eugene O'Neill heckled life in one of the bitterest and lengthiest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coalinurd ? from Page 90 ) I not fearful that 1 should be hissed as a blasphemist , I should suggest that Mr. O'Neill is a blend of the sincere artist and the shrewd mountebank . " Regarding the so-called divine Sarah Bernhardt : " To me , in every role she is Mona Lisa , disinterested , semismiling and inscrutable , save for the knowledge that she insists on being paid every night in fresh 5100 bills . " In the old days the critics put on a sideshow that competed with the hammy histrionics behind the footlights . Woollcott held court in the lobby tricked out in a flowing cape and unbuckled galoshes . Broun , whose appearance was likened to that or an unmade bed , turned up for openings in a battered top hat and a suit with budt in wrinkles , Benchley stole the show from The Squall , a drama of seething Spanish passion in which Nubi , a crazy , mixed-up gypsy girl fleeing is vile oppressor , was given refuge by a noble family and proceeded to exhibit her gratitude by seducing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Throughout these murky goings-on the heroine protested her innocence and sirtue by proclaiming , " Me Nubi , me good girl . " In the second act , Benchley rose in his seat and announced , " Me Bob , me bad boy . Me go home . " Atkinson , who never leaves his seat during intermissions , and his colleagues now go out of their minds quietly and unobtrusively . Reviewers today may lack their predecessors ' flair and stylish sparkle , but they do a more serviceable job , It was a common practice years ago to use a play as a springboard for droll lines which were dreamed up on the way to the theater and had no relation to the business at hand . Critics now tell right off the bat what their readers want to know  --  whether the play is worth the price of admission . The old boys , captivated by their rhetoric , often overlooked that detail . Perhaps the most sweeping change in theatrical criticism is that actors no longer are targets for ridicule to get a gag in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom 's Cabin played here last night . The bloodhounds had poor support . " Creston Clarke never lived down Eugene Field 's comment on King Lear : " Mr. Clarke played the king all evening as though under constant fear that someone else was about to play the ace , " Heywood Broun was sued for 510,000 in 1917 by Geoffrey C. Stein after he wrote that Stein had given , in The Awakening of Spring , " the worst performance ever seen on any stage . " The court held a critic had the right to express his displeasure . The next time Stein trod the boards Broun observed " he was not up to his usual standard . " When critics wind up and throw barbs into a play now , they take dead aim at the author or producer and sympathize with the actors for getting trapped in the mishmash . Actors receive the old treatment only when there is extreme provocation , as in the case of Jay Robinson , a wealthy youth who financed , in 1951 , a revival of The Green Bay Tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he agreed , with the anguished director , to withdraw from the play . Nine months later , he turned up in Buy Me Blue Ribbons , a gem of a stinker about a filthy-rich actor who was kicked out of a play he bankrolled . Walter Kerr cut Robinson into small pieces with one stroke : " At the moment , he is suffering from delusions of adequacy . " Bruised artists and bankrupt producers have accused critics of practically every imaginable deficiency except one . Like baseball umpires , they are called blind , stupid bums , but even rabid opponents admit their decisions are thoroughly honest and unprejudiced , A few years ago two plays put their integrity to a severe test . Season in the Sun , written by Wolcott Gibbs , the New Yorker 's critic , and King of Hearts , directed by Kerr , were received more favorably by the public than by the critics . In both instances the reviewers chided their fraternity brothers for letting social significance get in the way of the jokes . " When Mr. Gibbs glows serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of play the drama critic of the New Yorker would look upon with devastating scorn . " I asked Gibbs what he thought of Watts ' review . " On the whole , " he answered , " it was a courteous piece , " Watts called King of Hearts " a dissatisfying play , " and Chapman said , " It seems to be a cartoon when it was meant as a caricature . " Jean Kerr , the critic 's wife , who was the co-author , was more candid . " I played it smart . I let Walter direct it instead of review it , " The Croix de Guerre for objectivity over and beyond the call of duty and discretion has hectri in James Whittaker 's undisputed possession for thirty-five years . Whittaker was married to Ina Claire , a big star , when his duties as the Daily News ' critic obliged him to render a dispassionate opinion of his wife 's artistry . He met the acid test unflinchingly . His review began : " When she married me , Ina Claire told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in The Gold Diggers to prove that she told the truth . " Miss Claire , a real trouper , was surprisingly philosophical about the whole thing . She did not divorce Whittaker un three years later .
