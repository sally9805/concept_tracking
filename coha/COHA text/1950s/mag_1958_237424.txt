One murky night last week a Chinese Nationalist convoy steamed west from the Formosa Strait 's Pescadores Islands toward the China coast . It consisted of a creaking , World War II-type LSM , two small gunboats and a minesweeper . For two nights in a row it had turned back in the face of Communist gunfire before accomplishing its mission : delivering supplies and 400 Chinese Nationalist reinforcements to the island of Quemoy . This time some 30 newsmen and photographers were also aboard , among them TIME Correspondent Jim Bell . Bell 's report : <P> By midnight we were approaching the island and could clearly see the air bursts of artillery as Tatan , Little Quemoy and the south shore of Quemoy itself took their nightly lacing . Six miles south of Quemoy 's shallow coast we dropped anchor , and three scuttle-nosed landing barges approached LSM 249 . The sea was wicked , and the three landing craft had a hard time coming alongside . The transfer started about 12:30 , but by 12:45 only half of us newsmen and 20 troops had managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats . At that moment shooting broke out all around us . <P> Our coxswain made a quick personal decision to execute the classic naval maneuver known as getting the hell out of here . Our escorts and minesweeper broke off and began firing back at the Communist PTs and gunboats that had ambushed us . Blood-red tracers zipped , skipped and finally floated out like spent skyrocket bursts as they sought targets . Brilliant , diamond-bright air bursts from Communist shore batteries to the east rained shrapnel down . Over the roar of small boats ' motors rose the baritone whump of Nationalist three-inchers and the chatter of both sides ' machine guns . <P> Barbed-Wire Landing . In our landing craft we felt big as a whale . Several times tracers sought us out but did not find us . The battlewise Chinese coxswain kept his head , stayed out of the line of fire , refused to allow his gunners to fire their two machine guns and give our position away . We were not touched , nor were the two other landing craft . For once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking Communists and our escorts . The Nationalists later claimed all but one of the attacking PTs and gunboats sunk , but I saw no explosions . One of the Nationalist gunboats got hit and was towed back to the Pescadores lying low in the water . The LSM also turned back , its troops and supplies still on board . <P> Our landing craft finally ducked clear of the firing and headed into Quemoy 's south coast . At 1:30 the bowlip slammed down , revealing a ghostly white beach . Communist shells were pounding over . We ran for it , and came smack up against barbed wire . Ducking into a bunker , we watched the second landing barge glide by like a sea monster . The third landing craft , carrying a group of U.S. military assistance advisory personnel , tore its bottom on an underwater barricade , and the U.S. officers , their gear lost , slogged ashore through neck-deep water .
