txt City officials seeking new revenue sources prepared data . for Mayor Wagner yesterday on two possible imposts  --  the payroll tax and the charge for overnight parking of automobiles . Any combination of new levies would be used to replace the proposed 3 per cent sales tax on commercial services , which the City Administration has indicated it will drop if one or more acceptable substitutes can be found . The sales tax extension has been estimated to yield $30,000 , - 000 a year , most of which would enable Mayor Wagner to increase the salaries of city employes in his $1,639,388,325 budget for 1954-55 . With this tax would go repeal , effective next Jan. 1 , of the $5 and $10 auto use tax , which produces about $8,500,000 a year . City legal experts were looking into the feasibility of a payroll tax considerably modified from the one visualized in 1953 when the Legislature passed and , Governor Dewey signed an enlafiling act . The modified version would exempt , if legal , persons with incomes up to $5,000 . Such a tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version , which authorized a $1,200 ex , emption , because it would not Ihit a large part of the rank-andfile voters who make up the bulk of the Democratic party here . The 1953 enabling bill perHnitted a payroll tax of one-half of 1 per cent , half on the employer and half on the employe . Its administrative paragraph set forth that any local law adopted by the city might contain provisions for exempting all work by domestic employes and ? " for the exemption of any other wages for work , labor or service paid // at a rate not in excess e $1,200 per annum . " The bill further set forth that such a local law was " not limited " ti ; these provisions . A knotty problem for legal aides was whether the languages of the enabling act made illegal the proposed lifting of the exemption from $1,200 to $5,000 . The original proposal , with a $1,200 exemption , was estimated to yield $60,000,000 a year . No estimate was available as to the yield of the increased-exemption tax . Mayor Wagner has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parking Plan Mayor Wagner has received reports from the Traffic and Police Departments that enactment of the overnight parking charge , at a rate of $5 a month , would require a complete overhaul of the city 's parking laws . As it is , any night parking between midnight and 7 A. M. is prohibited in excess of three hours . This would have to be changed . A recent survey by the police indicated the charge might bring in as much as $36,000,000 a year , with $6,000,000 of it needed to administer the impost . Data prepared by the Traffic Department is being studied by Corporation Counsel Adrian P. Burke . It has been recommended to the Mayor that the charge , if enacted , be collected quarterly , $15 for each period . The car owner 's parking license , purchased with the fee , probably would be a sticker . If Mayor Wagner should settle on the overnight parking fee , the impost would face the combined opposition of the New York Automobile Club and the Metropolitan Garage Board of Trade . One argument for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this practice is almost unenforceable . Last year the police served only 54,444 summonses for parking more than three hours between midnight and 7 A. M. , although a police survey recently showed as many as 700,000 cars parked in the city 's streets overnight . Yesterday fourteen persons attended a luncheon for newspaper publishers and their representatives . given at Gracie Mansion by Mayor Wagner . Here the impression prevailed that there was little likelihood of any revival of the sales tax extension by the City Administration and that the overnight parking charge would receive serious study . The Board of Estimate will meet at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon to adopt the budget . The Mayor 's Cabinet ? top advisers and strategic department heads ? will . meet at 3 P. M. The Cabinet meeting is expected to continue advisory deliberations on a replacement for the sales tax widening .
