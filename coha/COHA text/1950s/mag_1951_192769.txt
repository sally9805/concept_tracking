Like many another U.S. city , Portland ( pop . 77,000 ) worries about its people 's failure to take much interest in town affairs . Only 25% of its citizens bothered to vote in recent elections . In their search for a cure , Portlanders recently reinstituted an old down-East tradition , the town meeting . They began holding three a year , each in a different section , with the idea of covering the city 's twelve chief districts in four years . <P> Last week the town meeting was held at Jack Junior High School on Munjoy Hill , an old , rundown , Irish-leavened working-class district . The Hill 's toothless , white-haired 84-year-old Councilman Billy O'Brion afforded the meeting some rare advertising . " That section , " he cried , " is well taken care of by yours truly . There are just a few windbags up there who want to explode . All these town meetings are a frame-up . " After calling Portland 's City Manager Lyman Moore and the rest of the council " a bunch of crooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along without him . <P> By meeting time , as a result , almost 500 Munjoy Hill residents had crowded into the school auditorium and 100 had been turned away . The excitement began almost as soon as the city manager , the councilmen and other officials sat down on the stage . One Bob Rowe , a middle-aged postal clerk who wildly opposes the city government , rose and said : " It will be proved that Munjoy Hill has been neglected . " He heckled persistently . Finally the crowd cried : " Sit down . " But a fat man named William Holland was cheered when he rose , knocking a fellow citizen 's hat awry , and teed off on the city manager . <P> <P> Smiling Irishman . The city 's snow plowing , Holland said , in a rich Irish brogue , " is a disgrace to Portland . I shovel out my driveway and the city plows fill it up again . I called the city garage and told them to clean it away . The garage said , ' Billy , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd roared with laughter . Billy added good-naturedly , " We can drive you out of power on that issue alone . " <P> But a majority at the meeting had come in a serious mood . They wanted to talk about improvements , not politics , and demanded them in no uncertain tones . At one point , when City Manager Moore noted that Portland had two garbage collections a week , the men &; women of Munjoy Hill hooted with delighted sarcasm . " Once , Tuesday mornings , " piped a little man in the third row . Moore seemed startled , and promised to correct it . <P> He was brought up short again when an irate citizen asked how long a nearby rubbish dump was going to be permitted to burn . The city manager , who lost his sense of smell apparently as the result of a sinus infection ten years ago , did not realize that the stink penetrated even into the auditorium . When he said : " It is n't burning-the city is operating a wet dump , " new hoots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a changed opinion of how the dump smelled .
