Gilbert Stuart learned his art in London , and before returning to the U.S. to paint his famed portraits of Washington* he did brilliant work there . Last week one of his best British portraits , never before seen in the U.S. , went on exhibition in Washington 's National Gallery . Entitled The Skater , it portrayed an elegant gentleman named William Grant taking a whirl on the ice in St. James 's . Park . The picture showed that Stuart quickly learned the knack of making his subjects look noble and lifelike at the same time . <P> Stuart neglected to sign The Skater , and Englishmen came to assume that one of their own great 18th Century portraitists must have painted it . In 1878 the picture was shown at London 's Royal Academy , and a contemporary critic wrote : " A more graceful and manly figure was surely never painted by an English artist , and if Gainsborough were that artist this is unquestionably his masterpiece . " <P> The owner , wondering whether he had a genuine Gainsborough , wrote for information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came the reply , " was painted by an American artist little known in England but highly appreciated in America . His name , Stuart . " <P> <P> - Of which Stuart himself painted over 100 copies of three main versions . Best-known version : that used on the $$ U.S. postage stamp ( 1932-38 ) .
