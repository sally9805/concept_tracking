Confident Democrats having a high old time together , all 900 luncheon eaters ( $28 a plate ) at Washington 's Mayflower Hotel , applauded joyously one day last week when Party Faithful Tallulah Bankhead , wrapping her " dahlings " in her bourbon drawl , breathed spite upon the opposition . " Dirt is too clean a word for him , " she said of Vice President Richard Nixon . Fumbling for an exit bit , Tallu focused upon the seated form of Harry S. Truman , listed sharply in a maneuver designed to land in his lap but , defeated by his red-faced agility , * succeeded only in a bear hug . Bawled she : " The warmth that comes out of that man just kills me . " <P> All the same , Harry Truman had a chilly warning to give , based on his 1948 lesson to the Republican Party that straw polls and cocksureness can upset any campaign . " I find only one thing wrong with Democrats today , " he said . " They are suffering from Deweyitis , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't decide the election is won because the Democratic curve is going up . We 've got to keep fighting until the polls are closed . " <P> Other chief Democrats stumping and rallying right down to polling day : <P> Senator John Kennedy , Massachusetts urbanite who voted against rigid price props in 1956 , preceded Eisenhower at Cedar Rapids ' corn-picking contest with a stemwinding attack upon the author of flexible props , Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson : " His objective may be to get the government out of the farming business , but the farmers ' objective apparently is to get Mr. Benson out of the governing business . " <P> Adlai Stevenson , at a labor-organized bean-and-wiener feed ( $1 a plate ) in Milwaukee Auditorium , said : " The tragedy of the Eisenhower Administration is that its only weapons seem to be platitudes or paratroops . And this seems to be true whether the situation is Little Rock or Lebanon , South America or Quemoy . " <P> Lyndon Johnson , Senate Majority Leader , in a blast in the coal-mining center of Welch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elect two new Democratic Senators to replace its Republicans . He charged that the G.O.P. is running against Old Socialist Eugene Victor Debs , because they know they " can beat poor old Gene Debs , because he is dead and buried . But , " cried Johnson , " they ca n't beat unemployment , they ca n't beat sickness and disease , and they ca n't beat Khrushchev by resurrecting a dead man-and a dead issue-and kicking him around . " <P> Paul M. Butler , National Chairman in a Chicago debate with his G.O.P. opposite number , Meade Alcorn , who forced Northern Democrat Butler to talk about Southern Democrat Orval Faubus of Arkansas , said : " We will not tolerate that kind of an un-American attitude in a party that represents the American people . " <P> Eleanor Roosevelt , 74 , talked and talked in New York for Averell Harriman , dashed out to Topeka , where she made her comparisons between her husband and the White House 's present resident : " We have never lacked greatness but at the moment we lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President of the United States . It has been nil . "
