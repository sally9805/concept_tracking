Next to his wife , durable Screen Siren Joan Crawford , the personal pride of Pepsi-Cola Chairman Alfred Nu Steele is his gymnasium-sized Manhattan apartment , 13 stories above Fifth Avenue at 70th Street . Easily awed Broadway columnists have dubbed it " Taj Joan . " But it 's quite a place ; Joan insists that visitors remove their shoes before entering lest they soil the quicksand-soft golden carpets . <P> Last week Steele , Joan and Taj Joan all hit the spot-the one marked X-at Pepsi 's annual stockholders ' meeting . Reason : a small note on page 6 of the annual proxy statement . <P> " During 1957 , Mr. Steele had extensive alterations and structural changes made in the cooperative apartment . As Mr. Steele was absent from New York on company affairs for some 165 days in 1957 , the Company paid for him , and charged monthly to his account , costs on this work . The largest aggregate amount of debt from Mr. Steele was $387,011.65 . <P> <P> This has been repaid in full . Interest at the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that $387,011.65 is a lot of Pepsi . Professional Corporation Baiter John Gilbert ( no kin to the silent screen idol ) asked if the apartment was finally finished . Steele replied that it was ; he had revealed the loan because Securities and Exchange Commission rules state that company proxy statements must list and explain all financial transactions with officers or big stockholders . <P> The apartment had cost an additional $80,000 for decorating . The 18 rooms had been turned into eight , furnished with all of the comforts of modern civilization . Among them : a cavernous closet just for Miss Crawford 's 304 pairs of shoes , another for her cosmetics and pills , a special shampoo and hairdressing basin with spray faucets , a massage table and whirlpool tub for Steele , a diamond-shaped dining-room table , a geranium-pink bedroom with wood-burning fireplace . <P> Critic Gilbert then said he had some questions for Miss Crawford , who had been sitting quietly in the back of the room . <P> Said she : " Make it brief , boy . " <P> Gilbert said Miss Crawford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " If I were , " she replied , " we 'd have long sessions but short speeches . " <P> Persisted Gilbert : " May I ask how many shares of Pepsi-Cola you own ? " <P> " It 's none of your business , " she snapped . " Besides , I owned them before I married Mr. Steele . " * <P> Then Steele cut in : " I let my wife run her business , and she lets me run mine . " <P> But , as every Pepsi fan knows , behind every successful man ( Pepsi 's 1958 earnings are up ) , there is a devoted woman-one with more bounce to the ounce . This week , their apartment decorated and their debts to Pepsi paid , Mr. and Mrs. Steele were planning a six-weeks sales swing through Africa and the Middle East . Said he : " I hate to use my wife to help me sell , but let 's face it-she does . On these trips most of our business is done through top officials of governments . At those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1955 . Before that , Joan was married to <P> Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , 1929 , Franchot Tone , <P> 1935 , and Phillip Terry , 1942 . Steele has been married twice before .
