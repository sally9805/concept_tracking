Fortnight ago , when Britain suffered its first race riots ( TiME , Sept. 8 ) , most Britons were inclined to dismiss them as a shocking but temporary aberration . Last week , in shame and humiliation , Englishmen learned that racism had become part of the British way of life . <P> Every night last week-except twice when it rained-the mobs surged through London 's seedy Netting Hill and Paddington districts . In Latimer Road , Soapboxer Jeffrey Hamm roared that Fascist Sir Oswald Mosley 's Union Movement had warned five years ago that racial flare-ups would result from the government 's " open-door " policy to Negroes from the colonies and Commonwealth . " Deport colored people found guilty of crime ! " he shouted . From the crowd of 2,000 teenagers came a hissing , ecstatic " Yesss ! " A carload of Negroes went slowly by , and 200 screaming Teddy boys peeled off from the crowd , chased after it . <P> On Ledbury Road , hoodlums worked systematically down the street hurling bricks and milk bottles at every house where Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calypso Club , three Molotov cocktails ( bottles filled with gasoline ignited by a wick ) were hurled out at the crowd . " Kill the bloody spades ! " shrieked a 15-year-old Teddy boy . Others took up the cry-but it changed to " Kill the bloody coppers ! " as truncheon-flailing police surged into the mob . Dozens were arrested and police stations stacked up piles of bicycle chains and tire irons , flick knives and nail-studded belts taken from the rioters . " It 's become a teen-age sport , " said the officer in charge of West London night operations . <P> The Lesson of Little Rock . Why were they doing it ? " I reckon Little Rock learned us a lesson , " snarled one Teddy boy . Ranted a black-bearded ex-serviceman : " I 'm a nigger hater all right . I happen to love this country of mine . . . Before the war we were supreme beings-30,000 of us kept one-third of the earth 's surface in order . We 've got to keep the blacks down or they 'll take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that the hoodlums came from all over London , even from areas where there were no Negroes , " because these stunted , pallid thugs like the chance of violence without danger . " <P> Rising Tide . As Commonwealth ministers from the West Indies and Africa flew hastily into London to express " grave concern " over the continuing riots , the British government seemed to be more than ever at a loss just what to do about it . Home Secretary R. A. Butler , speaking to a Conservative rally at Saffron Waiden , carefully avoided committing himself to anything . " It has always been the right of British citizenship to come in and out of the mother country at will , and it will need considerable force of argument to alter this policy , " he said . On the other hand , Butler noted that even " before these incidents we have been reviewing the volume of colored immigration and what happens to those who come here from our Commonwealth countries .
