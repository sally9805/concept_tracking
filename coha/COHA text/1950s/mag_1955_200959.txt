DearTIME-Reader : <P> <P> IN this issue appears John Graham Dowling 's last story ( see Frontier , 1955 , HEMISPHERE ) . His assignment in Paraguay finished , Buenos Aires Bureau Chief Dowling was flying south to the revolt in Argentina last week when he was killed in a fog-bound airliner crash , five miles from Asuncion . He was the ninth correspondent killed on foreign assignment for TIME Inc . <P> Dowling , 41 , was a quiet , deadpan reporter whose field was war . He started out playing at it with the toy soldiers collected for him all over the world by his famous parents , Actor-Producer Eddie Dowling and Comedienne Ray Dooley . He grew up to make a career of combat . He was in the front lines at Guadalcanal , covered the Allied campaign in New Guinea , watched the Japanese surrender in Manila Bay as a World War II correspondent for the Chicago Sun . He won the Ernie Pyle award in 1946 for distinguished war reporting . Death nearly touched him more than once : in Burma he escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached , and on Leyte a bomb fatally wounded three U.S. newsmen sleeping alongside him . <P> After the Java Sea defeat , he wrote a sardonic song called I Wanted Wings . Pilots were still singing it , eight years later , in Korea . As famous throughout the Pacific as his war song was Dowling 's personal courage . Terrified of flying , he tried to overcome his fear by parachuting . On Luzon , he made a battle jump with the 11th Airborne Division in civilian street shoes . Result : one broken ankle . Said TIME HEMISPHERE Editor John Walker , who survived the Leyte bomb blast with Dowling : " Being with him made you braver than you were . " <P> Away from a battle zone , Dowling felt AWOL , but in April 1945 he took time out to marry his Chicago editor 's secretary , Patricia Louise Shafer , after an eight-day courtship . They had one child , Gordon , now two years old . <P> After he became TIME 'S Southeast Asia correspondent in 1950 , Dowling commuted between his Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painstaking dispatches for TIME 'S cover stories on France 's GENERAL JEAN DE LATTRE DE TASSIGNY ( Sept. 24 , 1951 ) and GENERAL SIR GERALD TEMPLER of Malaya ( Dec. 15 , 1952 ) were models of thoughtful reporting . <P> Reporter Dowling knew how to handle people . Stiff-backed General Templer almost managed a smile as he told him : " You are like me . I can handle you ! " Cambodia 's King Norodom was enchanted when Dowling did the rongeng , a Malayan dance , for him . But his basic technique , he used to say , was silence . " Sooner or later something always snaps in the other person . Someone has to talk . " <P> Cordially yours ,
