Organizing the millions of wage earners who still do not belong to unions is recognized by both the AFL and CIO as their number one job after the coming merger . CIO President Walter Reuther 's United Auto Workers union has already authorized a contribution of $1.5 million toward such a campaign to organize the unorganized , and UAW Vice President John Livingston has been named Director of Organization in the new federation . " A .. united ' labor move-. ment , " Reuther recently explained , " will have the resources and can raise the necessary money and provide the needed staff to launch a comprehensive and effective organizational crusade . We can organize the chemical , textile , wood and other basic industries and bring through organization higher wages and improved working conditions . " George /Many , - the new president of the combined groups , is doing his best to spread this enthusiasm to other unions . Mr. Senser 's story illustrates what organizing with scant resources and staff is like today . 0 vER on Mill Row , the rice mills stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a small frame hall a few blocks away , Rice Workers Local 321 is meeting as it has monthly for two years , not to assault the castles but to rebuild them . The secretary says a brief opening prayer : " Lord . bless us through this meeting . We know that without you we can not do nothing . A few among the 35 members there-25 whites and 10 Negroes add a low Amen . Local 321 of the National Agricultural Workers Union ( AFL ) is ready to get down to business . The business before it is a crisis , the latest of many for a struggling local of 300 members in the nonunion community of Crowley , La. ( pop . 14,000 ) . Tonight , as a slight drizzle falls outside , the member- ship meeting must reach a decision on this crucial Bob Senser is the assistant editor of Work , the publication of the Catholic Labor Alliance . issue : Should it sign a contract with one of Crowley " s four unionized rice mills , a historic contract which provides for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue fighting for the rights of 34 workers whose cases ? charging loss of job because of union activity ? are pending before the National Labor Relations Board ? The local must choose one course or the other . For men and women earning from 80 cents to $1 an hour , an increase of 20 cents is like a pot of gold . Besides , this is the first contract the local has negotiated with the Crowley mill of Louisiana Rice Growers , Inc. ? the mill which , according to some wiseacres around town , - would never give in and sign a union contract . " Just 11 months ago the union won an NLRB election at the mill , 34-32 . Four days later 34 workers were told there was no work for them , at least not for a while . The word got around quickly along Mill Row : the 34 workers were those who had expressed themselves as pro-union , both in conversations around the mill and at the NLRB ballot box . True , in recent weeks the mill has called back most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact number . But what about all the paychecks they lost ? What about the men whom the mill has refused to rehire , including the president of the local ? Could the union turn its back on these ? And yet , as a practical matter , could the union make the NLRB charges stick ? At least one key witness has refused to testify , for fear of losing a part-time political job . What to do ? The pros and cons have the union officers in a sweat . Sitting on the sidelines is Joe Guidry , of nearby LaFayette , La. , staff representative of the national union , the man who headed the campaign to organize Local 321 . Most of his day was spent discussing the contract issue with various key people in the local . He decided , around the supper table , not to take a position . ( ' ' The people ought to make up their own minds . They 'll have to do it when I 'm pulled out of here on some other campaign . " ) But Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not keep his thoughts to himself . He stirs in his seat , and the chairman says : " Brother Joe has something to say . " Brother Joe looks around the small hall , rented for $2 a meeting from a Negro club . There are only five people present from the Louisiana Rice Growers mill . Where are the 70 others ? Were they afraid to show up , or did n't they care enough to brave the rain ? ( Seven others do finally come in just before the meeting closes . If you members want us to sign that contract Joe Guidry says we will , of course . But I think this is a matter of principle . Sure , the people would get 20 cents an hour more , and God knows they need it . But put yourself in the place of one of those who still has n't his old job back . What would you say then ? Would you think that you were worth sacrificing for 20 cents an hour ? A veteran rice worker shouts " No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out that on March 1 , 1956 , the new federal minimum wage will go into effect , and since the company will have . to grant a wage increase at that time anyway , the 20 cents is n't the bargain it seems to be . Besides , the mill wants a short-term contract expiring April 1 , 1956. - You know how they 're getting ready for that , ' ' Guidry says . " They 're hiring a lot of nonunion people so that they can have a decertification election to kick the union out of the place then . Somebody grunts , " That 's right . " A woman , one of the ill-fated 34 ( but recently rehired ) , rises to offer a very personal argument : ' ' I do n't see how ' signing the contract will help me. - By then the majority sentiment is clear . Nobody speaks in favor of accepting the contract , The vote to reject it is unanimous . Tomorrow Guidry will phone the mill lawyer and tell him so . There are more crises around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What will management say at the next bargaining session ? What will be the reaction of absent members when they learn the union has turned ? down a.big wage increase ? For that matter , what will the new AFL-CIO do about organizing farm workers and agricultural processing workers ? The future of Local 321 is woven inextricably with the unorganized mass in the farm labor force , particularly the thousands of other rice workers in Louisiana , Arkansas and Texas . Joe Guidry talking with a worker with a grievance hood of Teamsters has drawn dairy-farm milkers into its wide and firm embrace . But outside of . these and a few other successes , US commercial farms and their nearby processing plants are a vast graveyard of lost strikes , fruitless organizing campaigns , and disillusioned organizers . Local 321 of Crowley may or may not join the casualty list , but as it struggles for survival it dramatizes organized labor 's problems , frustrations and opportunities in the agricultural industr ) , . Crowley 's rice workers , like other processing workers , do have an edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers get up to $25 a week in unemployment compensation , and when injured on the job , up to a week in workmen 's compensation . The Lair Labor Standards Act guarantees them time-and-a-half for overtime ( the whole town booms when the mills arc on overtime in the late summer and fall ) . The Taft-Hartley Act offers its protection for self-organization . But field workers are excluded from these basic benefits . Despite the sanction which government gives unions in agricultural processing , the attitude toward organization in Southern rice mills is typically rural : the organization of owners and operators is as natural as water in a rice paddy ; the organization of workers is as natural as weeds . The Rice Millers Association , with headquarters in New Orleans , counts in its membership - rti ; mills in three states . Through Local 321 the NAWIT has a precarious hold in four of the 1 -- i rice mills of Crowley , which calls itself the " Rice Capital of the World . " Employers in Crowley are more moderate than the aristocrats who rule the sugar-cane plantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to sit down with the NAWU despite the personal intervention of the Archbishop of New Orleans and despite a costly strike ( which ended in disaster to the union ) . Yet even the liberal mill owner in Crowley straggles far behind the steel mill industrialist , for example . Joint labor-manage-t : ment committees in steel mills are routine . When Local 321 suggested one to cut the high accident rate that afflicts Mill Row , the owner threw up his hands , and delivered a brief lecture on management prerogatives . Even active unionists tend to grasp at strange straws for support . " You do n't know how they do us in them mills , " one worker complained . His solution : " If only the merchants in this town would get back of us , we would get somewhere . " Yet such management attitudes would change if rankand-file support for the union were vigorous . In his more despondent moments , Joe Guidry says : " The average worker in a rural area wants big city benefits brought to him on a silver platter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of dual loyalty ? to both the union and the employer ? has not yet grown deep in Crowley , mostly because of a long management tradition of uprooting it . Earl Wilson , a tall Negro , had something you might call dual loyalty . From the age of 14 on , Earl Wilson carried 100-pound sacks of rice in a mill warehouse department . For 37 years he worked as hard as any other man in the mills , and then some , even in the days when the pay was $1 a day . Many times , however , he longed to be active in a union . In 1947 , when an AFL Teamsters staff man came to town , he got his chance . He signed up for Card No. 1 in the local union which the Teamsters tried to establish . When the union called a strike to win recognition , Wilson was on the picket line , day in and day out , rain or shine . He walked it for five months , often alone toward the end . After the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job left at the mill . For the past eight years he and his wife have been supporting eight children on part-time work . One of his motives for going all-out for unionism was to make the mills better for his sons . One of his boys did apply for a mill job . " They asked if he was Earl Wilson 's son , and that was the end of it , " Wilson says . Although he no longer works in the mills , Local 321 has elected Wilson sergeant-at-arms . But his greatest distinction is being Crowley 's Exhibit A of what can-happen to a man who gets tagged as an " agitator . " F EAR , not just apathy , is Local 321 's main obstacle in getting support . Fear of being transferred to a less desirable job . Fear of being laid off . Fear of not being called back to work after a seasonal lay-off . One powerful fact restricts the freedom of the Crowley rice worker : he does not have the assurance that another job is available somewhere nearby in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , but even among the whites few have the versatility of Roy Stewart , Local 321 president , who went to work on a nearby oil field after a rice mill discharged him . Stewart 's case , like the others , is being fought before the NLRB . But the local must also contend with other kinds of employer pressure much more difficult to challenge before the Board . A few days befOre an NLRB election , for example , one mill owner threw a chicken barbecue . It was a small but worthwhile investment . The gesture ? combined with carefully worded promises of a bonus , Guidry claims ? swung the election against Local 321 by a 47-13 vote . " If only we could 've thrown a barbecue , that might have cancelled out theirs , " Guidry says . But NAWU does n't have the money for such trimmings . Since a dues check-off is in effect at only one small mill , the treasury ca n't bear the expense even of a monthly supper for the executive board . 0 N THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toleration , or better , from the community . Its unsegregated meetings , the only in Crowley , go unquestioned . Guidry , who remembers vividly how the police of Franklin , La. , ran him out of town in 1953 , is treated like an ordinary citizen by local police . This community acceptance is due , in part at least , to the local 's political potential . While small in numbers , the local does have enough men ( such as Earl Wilson ) who go out and hustle on and before election day . The registrar of voters used to have a habit of going home when a Negro appeared to register . According to Wilson , the Teamster organizer told the registrar in 1947 : " If you 're tired of registering Negroes , let me know and I 'll get someone else to do it . " Things started changing from then on . Today two of Crowley 's eight councilmen are Negroes . " And now , " says Wilson , " if you are n't registered , they ask you how come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is n't Tradical . " It has never called a strike ? in fact , outside speakers at Local 321 meetings are warned not to engage in strike talk . The disastrous 1953 sugar cane strike has sobered Guidry and others on the possibility of a small union winning a strike against a vastly more powerful employers ' organization , especially in Louisiana 's present political climate ( complete with a " right to work " law ) . " The way the fellows feel at times , " says Guidry , " you could give a strong speech at a meeting and whip up enough anger to get them to run right out and tear the mills apart . But that would be the end of Local 321 . " At crucial meetings ? such as the one on the 20-ceni wage offer ? there are repeated references to " working within the law . " Proud of the local 's record , Arthur Smith , Local 321 's prayerful secretary , says : " When we meet management , we do n't have to look clown ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Local 321 does n't have the opportunity to face many managements . With only four mills unionized , there remain in Crowley at least 25 non-union rice establishments ? mills , rice driers and warehouses . Dispersed among these are about 1,700 workers , within Local 321 's jurisdiction but outside its ranks . The battle of organizing such dispersed workers is an uneven one for a local with a small treasury and one organizer . " It 's like hunting an elephant with a popgun , " Guidry says . Perhaps the merged AFL-CIO will supply a few more adequate weapons .
