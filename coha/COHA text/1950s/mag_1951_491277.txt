CONCLUSION HE dominant skyscraper in New York 's T Rockefeller Center soars upward almost 1000 feet , so that , from the upper floors , the vista of a great metropolis stretches out on every side , laced by glistening rivers , bordered by the ocean and with the horizon limited only by the majestic curve of the earth 's surface . Here , high above the city noises , five busy men meet frequently to talk about problems that cover an even wider horizon . Sometimes they discuss the effect of drought on the corn crop in Brazil ; sometimes it is the best building material for workers ' homes in the Belgian Congo ; again it may be the latest development in the field of electronics , and not infrequently it is rocket motors that may one day fly to the moon . These things and many more are of vital and everyday concern to the five men , all of whom are brothers named Rockefeller  --  John D. III , Nelson , Laurance , Winthrop and David . They meet , sometimes as often as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyscraper offices but at the home of one brother or another , whenever one of them has a problem or an idea or a proposition that impinges on the interests of all . Very rarely there is a sixth man present , and when he is there they listen carefully to what he has to say and they argue with him only when they 're sure of their grounds , because the alchemy of the years has increased rather than diminished the respect of the five for their father , John D. Rockefeller , Jr . These sessions to co-ordinate activities and thresh out differences of opinion are an old custom in the Rockefeller family , but it is largely since the five brothers returned to New York after World War II that they have been able to focus their joint and individual endeavors in a broad workable pattern . This still is not a simple matter . Each is a distinct individualist , with his own interests and ideas , and , on occasion , the family sessions have displayed a lack of harmony comparable only to a chance meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of trial-and-error method , they have shaped their general objectives along similar lines and evolved a solid family working basis and harmonized their attitudes to such an extent that today they are all likely to use about the same words and phrases  --  sometimes very stilted phrases  --  to describe what they are trying to do . In the broadest sense , what they want to do is to use their talents , energies and wealth in a manner that will contribute most effectively to the progress of society in our time and to vitalization of the democratic capitalist system in this era of totalitarian-made world crises . " The third generation of Rockefellers. " an associate remarked recently , " is still exporting the missionary idea , just as their grandfather did through his large contributions to foreign missions of the church . " It is perfectly true that there is a strong missionary motive in some of their operations , but their methods can hardly be compared to the technique of saving heathen souls in earlier days . Times have changed , and so have the Rockefeller objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one of the brothers commented . " Father said that you have to do something to keep people healthy as well as to save their souls . Perhaps my generation agrees with both ideas , but adds that people also must have security . " In a practical rather than a philosophical sense , what the Rockefellers are trying to do is prove by example that private business , co-operating with government as may be necessary , can make a fair profit and still achieve major social objectives , particularly in the advancement of the health and prosperity and security of low-income groups and of the restless , underdeveloped regions of the world . Specifically , they believe that this can be achieved by the development and extension into less-advanced areas of America 's vast achievements in technological fields and in sociological methods . It is a goal they regard not as idealistic , but as both logical and essential if our way of life is to be maintained and if the United States is to meet its responsibilities of world leadership in the face of such universal tensions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ ? , 000,000 Worth of Ideas THESE are broad phrases that could be as mean -- II- ingless as a political oration . The test is : What , if anything , are the Rockefeller brothers doing about it ? " You have big thoughts and big ideas , " Nelson once remarked , with a characteristic inclination to look at the facts , " but when it comes to doing , you usually feel that you 're doing only small things . " He paused and shrugged . " Well , small things can take you a small way forward if you 're headed in the right direction . " The brothers ' search for the right direction began in 1946 , when they gave their united efforts a formal existence , an event which the raucous New York Daily News greeted with the headline : THE ROCK Mon INCORPORATES ! The accompanying article announced formation of Rockefeller Brothers , Inc. , a limited-partnership company which was later reformed as a service agency to provide research and management , with Laurance as president . Although it sounds as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller Brothers , Inc. , is mainly a holding company for the ideas and ambitions , instead of money , of the five brothers and their sister , Mrs. Abby Rockefeller Pardee . It has offices and a staff , but only nominal capital , and it merely symbolizes a united front behind which each brother operates independently , with assistance from the others in whatever degree each desires to participate . In their own words , the organization is an outlet for their risk , or venture , capital and an effort to achieve social and economic progress " as well as a fair profit on investment . " Actually , the six children , acting as individuals , have put less than $4,000,000 into ventures directly sponsored by Rockefeller Brothers , Inc. , whereas their over-all investments of venture capital since the war total more than $15,000,000 . These investments , through Rockefeller Brothers , Inc. , and other similar projects , may be divided roughly into two groupings . First is the practice that has developed particularly since the war of using venture capital to build up businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less a gamble , but which pay off handsomely if successful and which contribute importantly to technological progress . Such investments normally are temporary  --  perhaps for five to ten years  --  and when the new enterprise is on its feet  --  or when it has definitely failed  --  the Rockefellers withdraw their original capital ? or take a loss ? for reinvestment in another venture project . Laurance 's shrewd business judgment and his flair for gadgets  --  meaning anything from a motorcycle engine to a rocket plane  --  have played an important role in such operations . After he had shown a strong interest in aviation before the war , an aircraft designer from St. Louis named J. S. McDonnell , Jr. , walked into ( Cont. et1 on Page 116 ) 116 THE ROCKEFELLERS ( CMItimierl from Page 28 ) his office one day with a brief case full of blueprints and an unhappy story of past financial experiences . McDonnell had only a small experimental shop , but he was a skillful and creative engineer , and when he departed a few hours later he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit plane that the Army had n't even ordered . The plane he built never got into production , for complicated reasons , but by that time Laurance , as a member of the board , had co-operated in providing top-grade managerial talent at the experimental shop and had interested his brothers in investing in McDonnell . Backed by $475,000 of Rockefeller money  --  most of it Laurance 's  --  the shop blossomed into the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation , did subcontracting on Army bombers during the war , produced the Navy 's high-flying Banshee jet fighter and , in 1950 , made a profit of $2,800,000 on $39,000,000 sales . Other enterprises developed by the five brothers , in much the same manner include the Piasecki Helicopter Company , the Laboratory for Electronics , Inc. , the Universal Business Machines , Inc. , which makes a high-speed offset duplicating machine , and Reaction Motors , Inc. , which built the liquid-fuel engine to power the Navy 's spectacular new rockets and also powered the Army 's supersonic record-breaking speed plane , Bell XS-1 . " What we are trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managerial strength , " Laurance explains . " Instead of holding capital back until a field is proved safe , we are undertaking pioneering projects that , with proper backing , will encourage sound scientific and economic progress in new fields , where there will be tremendous future development . " In the second grouping of investments , the Rockefellers have acted on a still broader philosophical concept by putting venture capital into projects that may be very slow to show even a modest profit , but will , if successful , fulfill an important social purpose . In fact , the social objectives are often equal to or even more important than January 13 , 1951 immediate business success , inasmuch as the main purpose is to establish a trend that could be of major economic or technological significance in the future . " We 're really setting up pilot plants , " Nelson explained not long ago , " and we hope they 'll show some of the things American enterprise can do to solve the big problems of the day . Because they 've got to be solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brothers have been interested , but to varying degrees , in these enterprises which are designed to contribute to economic and social progress and to make a profit at the same time . These twin goals have been approached in various ways and with varying results . An enterprise known as Island Packers , Inc. , was initiated , for example , in 1948 with the idea of boosting the economy of two underdeveloped areas in the South Seas . The plan was to aid the Fiji Islands by employing native labor to catch tuna and to aid American Samoa by erecting there a tuna-canning plant , which would employ native workers . The product would then be sold on the American market and a fair return would be made on the investment . On this basis , fishing boats were acquired and converted for use in tropical waters and a plant was erected  --  and only then was it discovered that there were n't enough tuna in the area to make the business pay oft On the other hand , a project known informally as Filtisaf ? Filatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent Belgian capital to manufacture cotton textiles in the Belgian Congo . The factory as well as housing for native labor had to be built from scratch , and machinery was imported from the United States . These were formidable obstacles to overcome , but Filtisaf quickly showed that it would make a profit sooner than expected , in addition to contributing significantly to the economic development of a region that , since the war , has assumed more and more importance to the future of Western civilization . At home the brothers ' interests included the problem of low-cost housing and , after various experiments , they developed a method originated by Architect Wallace K. Harrison for ( Continued on Page 118 ) ( Continued from Page 116 ) building small concrete houses at a high rate of speed and a low rate of expenditure . Harrison reversed the usual procedure of mass-producing houses in sections at the factory and , by using concrete , achieved the effect of moving the factory to the site in order to eliminate heavy transportation costs . He used steel forms which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and locked together or unlocked in a few minutes . When the system had been smoothed out , the Rockefellers set up a housing corporation and built 204 houses for a real-estate development at Norfolk , Virginia , for six dollars a square foot compared to a normal ten dollars for conventional construction . They were surprised when they made about 12 per cent on the original job  --  this was later drastically reduced by additional experimental work on the houses  --  and when the real-estate developer could sell the homes for a profit at $5400 or rent them for $45 a month . While these enterprises were being developed in the years after the war , a still more ambitious Rockefeller project was coming into bloom in Latin America , with the creation of a major experimental concern called International Basic Economy Corporation , but known informally as IBEC . Nelson is ! the guiding spirit of IBEC , but so'j broad is its purpose that it covers the varied activities of the brothers by : combining a little of everything from hard-boiled business and high finance to philanthropy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " Nelson says:i " The United States is a rich and pow-1 erful country in a poor world ; like a rich family in a poor town . The poor do n't want charity , but they would like to be helped to stand on their own feet . In the past , business went into foreign areas to get markets or materials . Maybe the foreign area benefited , but that was incidental . It was n't planned that way . That system is n't enough today . Our welfare and security depend on the welfare and security of other peoples . We 've got to help them stand on their own feet . We have to form a kind of partnership in which they are given the incentive and the means to progress . As partners , we have to work together for mutual gain . " The New York business community failed to run a temperature over Nelson 's ideas . Many hardheaded businessmen saw them only as a reflection of the New Deal do-good theme . They were , in fact , an amalgamation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was just one difference . Once they had adopted the idea , the Rockefellers did something about it . IBEC was incorporated in 1947 with paid-in capital of about $5,000,000 ? mostly Nelson 's  --  and later that total was increased to $8,405,000 . The staff included a number of men and women drawn from wartime Government jobs . Economists were sent to Brazil and Venezuela to study the factors retarding economic development and to determine the major bottlenecks and recommend what could be done about them . How , the Rockefellers asked , can we invest our capital to demonstrate the best way in which underdeveloped areas can be assisted to stand on their own feet and become profitable segments of the world economy ? The answers that came back were varied and the experiments that IBEC has inaugurated have met with varying degrees of success . A few examples will suffice . In Venezuela , for instance , foreign capital had developed one of the world 's great oil sources , yet a great part of the country remained in an undeveloped state and at a low economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the nation 's food had to be imported at high cost . The first problem to be solved , obviously , was that of food at a reasonable cost . IBEC joined with the oil companies  --  which have invested about $10,000,000 in nonvoting preferred stock  --  to form the $12,380,000 Venezuela Basic Economy Corporation , which , in turn , set up a number of experimental business enterprises in co-operation with the Venezuelan Government and local capital . These were " pilot plants , " intended to form a pattern for bolstering the national economy . One of the first things seen by the experts was that the waters off the coast were famous fishing grounds , yet fish which should be plentiful and cheap ? formed a very small part of the national diet . This looked like a perfect setup for VBEC . With a capital of $1,500,000 , a fishing company was created to equip the customary sailing boats with gasoline engines and iceboxes at low installment rates , and an $800,000 refrigeration and ice plant was built to buy the fishing fleet 's catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was expected the fishermen would make a better and steadier income , there would be a constant supply of fish on the market at lower prices , a contribution would be made to solution of the food problem and investors would get a profit . The whole proposition was foolproof ... on paper . In practice , it made a technological contribution to the fishing industry and otherwise fell flat on its face . It proved difficult to convert the fishermen to gasoline motors . Then , when the fish reached the market at the rate of about fifty tons a month , the housewives shied away from them . " You ca n't , " one of the experts said later , " change the habits of a lifetime in a hurry . " The company is still operating at a loss and its future is uncertain . Other VBEC enterprises were more fortunate , particularly the modernization of three large farms  --  one of 8000 acres  --  introduction of new livestock strains and establishment of three su permarkets to make food accessible at low cost . But one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil , which produces the world 's fourth largest corn crop , but has been severely handicapped on the world market because of substandard varieties , lack of mechanization , inadequate storage facilities and outdated methods of handling grain . Three subsidiary companies were established to demonstrate methods of overcoming these obstacles , including a $163,000 hybrid-seed company which took over the experimental work of two Brazilian scientists and developed it into large-scale production . In the first year of trial , a severe drought ruined much of the Brazilian crop , but the hybrid corn came through . From then on , the seed company was unable to keep up with demand , although in 1950 the output was up to about 1250 tons . Not only has the quality of Brazilian corn been improved but over-all production has been boosted , because of the 35 per cent increased yield of the hybrid seed , and last year the company realized a return of around 30 per cent on its original stake . These examples no more than suggest the activities of IBEC in Venezuela and Brazil , where trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopters for spraying were introduced into areas that in some instances were so remote they had never seen any form of transportation other than burros . Modern farm equipment , strains of livestock better suited to the locality , elevators for storage , refrigeration plants and modern dairy methods were all part of the IBEC program , which emphasized two fundamentals : First , operation on a sound business basis ; and , second , the training of local personnel to take over all operational and managerial duties as rapidly as possible , as well as encouragement of local capital to assume control of the companies in the future . Nobody would be likely to quarrel with these objectives , but any businessman would be justified in asking whether IBEC proves anything . Given the Rockefeller money , anybody could build a refrigeration plant . But , as John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , used to ask his grandsons , " What do the figures show ? It 's the figures that count . " Figures count with the third generation of Rockefellers , too , and they emphasize that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially successful and thus attract other foreign and local capital to similar enterprises in the future . It is too early to predict final sue-cuss or failure , but here is the record : IBEC has an invested capital of over $8,000,000 , while the investments in companies which it has set up in the United States , Brazil , Venezuela and Ecuador total over $22,000,000 . After less than four years , seven of the companies were making money late in 1950 , six were still in the red , one was being liquidated and four new ones were in process of being organized . Considering the short time of operation and many unforeseen problems of any pioneer effort , the Rockefellers regard financial progress as encouraging , although as yet without notable success in attracting other capital to similar effort . It is essential , however , to keep in mind that the brothers believe an element of philanthropy is inseparable from good business practices in such enterprises as IBEC . With this in mind , they established in conjunction with IBEC the American International Association for Economic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can co-operate under a democratic system for improvement of their own living conditions . The AIA has a $5,000,000 budget , half of which is contributed by local governments , for a three-year program of farm rehabilitation , nutritional education , sanitation , research in control of pests and plant diseases , and supervised credit for farmers under terms reminiscent of the New Deal Farm Security Administration . Basically , the AIA provides expert knowledge , scientific methods and the idea of a co-operative mechanism  --  originated by the Rockefeller Foundation 's medical programs  --  under which local governments are brought into close co-operation in order to make the projects permanent regardless of future political changes . " We try to take the world 's organized knowledge , " explains Director Robert W. Hudgens , " and step it down and apply it to the lives of people who need such help . " What this means is that the AIA is introducing into Brazilian and Venezuelan rural communities such things as health clinics ; traveling movies which are part entertainment and part lessons in sanitation , nutrition and personal hygiene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , travel from town to town for classes in selection and cooking of the cheapest and most plentiful local foods . Road building also has been developed along the lines of the United States Forest Service mountain truck trails , opening numerous communities to traffic for the first time . And , with government assistance , a successful demonstration of supervised farm credit is well under way in the Brazilian state of Minas Geraes , giving small farmers their first opportunity to borrow money at reasonable rates , to operate their farms in a scientific manner and to break down the ancient pattern of peonage . AIA , which is still in an evolutionary stage , represents an advance in the Rockefeller development of the philanthropic method , but it is a small operation when compared with the total of about $800,000,000 which the family has expended for such purposes in three generations . Of the other philanthropies , the Rockefeller Foundation is perhaps the best known throughout the world . Although John D. , III , is a busy member of the board of trustees , it has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by men who are subject to no family influence . In fact , it has sometimes been a joke among their frientis that the best way to get the foundation to turn down a proposition is to suggest that it is favored by the Rockefeller &; On the other hand , Colonial Williamsburg , on which John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , spent some $30,000,000 for reconstruction , is entirely a family affair , and John , III , who is now chairman of the board , has devoted a great deal of his time to an elaborate program for attracting visitors to the old Virginia capital and for carrying the inspiring story of America 's early democracy to the nation . John also has taken a special interest since the war in American Youth Hostels , Inc. , of which be is now president . The youth-hostels movement in twenty-five countries is designed to promote international good will by encouraging young people to make hiking and cycling tours of their own and other countries . There are now about 120 supervised hostels in twenty-nine states in this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty cents . Each of , the brothers has numerous philanthropic and civic interests , some a them a continuation of long-established family associations and some of them newly acquired . David , for instance , is associated with at least a score of organizations in this category , and all of the brothers devote a tremendous amount of time and energy , as well as money , to such activities . Laurance , for example , assumed extensive duties as president of the board of managers of New York 's great Memorial Center for Cancer and Allied Diseases , an institution for which his father contributed the present one-block site in the heart of the city . He has also been especially interested in the field of conservation of land and national resources and , like his father and grandfather , is a Founder of the New York Zoological Society . He took an important part in expanding the society from a local to an international conservation and research organization and in setting up the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park in Wyoming for zoological research . Winthrop , who once remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have it , " has been a leading figure in the National Urban League , which deals with social problems of Negroes in urban areas . As vice-chairman of the Greater New York Fund in its initial year , 1938 , he was largely responsible for uniting all faiths and races in support of all local charities  --  an experiment that was so successful that it was still in practice when John was chairman of the fund drive in 1949 . His greatest efforts , however , have recently been devoted to his job as chairman of the board of trustees of the New York University-Bellevue Medical Center , a $33,000,000 project that is bringing to New York 's East Side one of the world 's finest institutions for teaching , research and care of the sick . The youngest Rockefeller son , David , has been chairman , since 1947 , of the New York International House , oldest of four such establishments set up by his father to encourage students to attend universities in countries other than their own . He has recently helped form among former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Page 122 ) ( Cont* I from Page 119 ) working in almost every country for world peace . David also has recently been active in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and was instrumental in planning the endowment 's new $3,800,000 international center to be erected facing the United Nations Plaza in New York as a home for organizations working for international harmony . Although these examples represent only a scattered sampling of the brothers ' activities , the theme of world peace and international understanding has long been a major factor in Rockefeller-family affairs . This is particularly true of the third generation and , on one occasion in 1946 , their intense interest in the success of the newly horn United Nations led to a unique demonstration of how they work together toward a common goal . At that time Nelson was a member of the mayor 's committee which had been attempting without much success to persuade the United Nations to construct its permanent headquarters in the New York area . The delegates were inclined toward New York , but no satisfactory site could be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of using the Rockefeller Center Theater as a meeting place for the General Assembly and had been severely disappointed when that proved impossible because of contract obligations . Meantime , other cities were bidding for the headquarters and it appeared likely that Philadelphia or San Francisco would be chosen . Nelson was in Mexico when it was announced that a final vote would be taken on December eleventh , but he flew home on December ninth to make a final effort to find a suitable New York site . At Lake Success he was given a discouraging report that the decision was virtually in the bag for Philadelphia . Late that night , however , a New York political reporter phoned Francis A. Jamieson , former newspaperman , Pulitzer Prize winner and , in recent years , the Rockefeller brothers ' public-relations chief , and said there was still a chance . " The delegates , " he reported , " want New York if they can get a good site . " At noon the next day , about twenty-two hours before the deadline for bids , Nelson met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a close adviser , and John E. Lockwood , who is the brothers ' legal adviser . His first remark was typical , " There 's something we can do . What is it ? " " All I 'm sure of is that we have to do it today , " Jamieson said . " They 'll come here if we find the right place , " somebody remarked . And then , referring to the Rockefeller estate up the Hudson River : " How about Pocantico Hills ? " Only a member of the family could fully appreciate the implications of this suggestion . The estate had been established by the boys ' grandfather . It is the spot their father loves more than any other in the world . The brothers considered it " hbme " from the time of their childhood , and their own children are growing up there . Yet . . . it might be the answer . Nelson telephoned John , who was in Virginia , explained the idea and asked , " How do you feel about giving up your house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . " " I just finished building it and I certainly do n't want to give it up , " he answered , " but if that 's the best way to solve the problem , I 'll do it . " Nelson asked David to come up from his Wall Street office to join the conference . He called in Laurance , whose office is across the hail , and he put in a telephone call for Winthrop , who was somewhere in South America . Laurance said he would go along . By that time David had arrived and heard the story too . " Is n't there some other way ? " he asked . " Could n't I give money to buy other land ? " That seemed unlikely . " All right . Count me in . " Maps were spread on Nelson 's desk . An air of excitement built up in the office . The telephone operator reported , that it was impossible to reach Winthrop . The others talked it over and agreed to assume Winthrop would cooperate . Then came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to give up his home there ? Perhaps it would he possible to save part of the estate for him if other adjacent hind could be purchased . Nelson called several influential friends near Pocantico Hills , told them of the plan and started them secretly getting options on suitable land . The idea was explained to their father at luncheon . When Nelson pointed out that they hoped to save part of the estate for him , Mr. Rockefeller said that it would be all right to give up the entire 3000 acres if necessary . That afternoon the work went on at high speed . Harrison went to consult with United Nations officials . A little later , Mr. Rockefeller called and suggested to Nelson that he make certain whether the UN would prefer to be in the suburbs or in the city . Nelson telephoned Sen. Warren Austin , head of the United States delegation , who said the delegates apparently wanted to be as near the center of the city as possible . Harrison returned to report that he had received a similar impression . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement in Nelson 's office faded into discouragement . Just before ' dinnertime , Nelson , Harrison , Lockwood and Jamieson pushed maps and notes aside and sat down to check results . They were tired and pessimistic . It looked as if the delegates thought Pocantico Hills was too far from New York . Nelson picked up the telephone and called his father , while the others listened . " I guess they 'd rather have some place in Manhattan , pa , " he said . There was a little pause . Then Mr. Rockefeller mentioned an area of several blocks on the East Side of Manhattan , where William Zeckendorf was planning to tear down a slum section and build skyscrapers . Could that land be purchased ? Harrison , whose firm was designing Zeckendorf 's project , said it might be had for $8,500,000 , which was more than Zeckendorf and his partner , Henry Sears , had paid . Nelson relayed the information to his father . " Well , " Mr. Rockefeller replied , " I think that 's all right , Nelson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you can get it , I ' H give it to them ; we can finish up the details at breakfasttime . " A great smile broke across Nelson 's face . " Pa ! " he exclaimed . " Why , pa , that 's wonderful ! " Mr. Rockefeller specified several conditions requiring agreement by the city and the Federal Government , and hung up . In Nelson 's office the work began all over again , with the deadline but fifteen hours away . The enthusiastic assistance of Robert Moses was enlisted to secure agreement by the city , and negotiations were started with Federal officials in Washington . Then all that was left to do was buy the property , draw up the proper papers and get them to Lake Success by ten-thirty the next morning . Harrison , who undertook the purchasing job , found Zeckendorf and Sears late that night at a New York night club where they were attending an anniversary celebration . He got them off at- a table by themselves , spread out a roll of blueprints and explained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller an option to buy the land for $8,500,000 , Harrison asked above the blare of the dance orchestra . January 13 , 1951 There was some argument , but , in the end , . Zeckendorf picked up Harrison 's red pencil and scribbled along the margin of the blueprint on which the area had been marked : " 8.5 million-1i United Nations only . December 10 for 30 days . " The partners signed it and Harrison put a circled A and B on the two sections of the map involved and added his initials to show they were both part of the same document . A description of the area also was written on the map . Harrison left the night club not long before midnight and stopped at a pay telephone to call Nelson . " It 's all set , " he reported . " Great , Wally . Let 's celebrate . Stop on your way for a bottle of champagne . " Ten minutes later Harrison arrived in Nelson 's office with the blueprints . " Wilere 's the champagne ? " Nelson demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy it , I discovered I had ( only a dollar and eighty-five cents in my pocket . " " That 's great ! You just put over an eight-million-dollar deal and you have n't got enough money to buy us a drink of champagne . " It took Lockwood several hours to draw up the legal papers and then , after a few hours ' sleep , he joined Nelson and Jamieson at Mr. Rockefeller 's apartment for breakfast . Everything was reviewed and approved . Time was getting short as Nelson enthusiastically gathered up the papers and prepared to depart . As he turned away from the table , Mr. Rockefeller touched him on the arm and , obviously thinking of earlier frustrations , asked , " Does this make up for the Center Theater , Nelson ? " Nelson nodded happily and c ran for the door . As Nelson arrived at Senator Austin 's hotel suite , a call from Secretary of State Byrnes at Washington gave assurance that the Government would agree to terms of the gift , specifically that it would be tax free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeing that New York would cede certain necessary street intersections . Three minutes later Austin was on his way to Lake Success with the papers , and at ten-thirty A.M. Dr. Eduardo Zuieta Angel , of Colombia , chairman of the United Nations Headquarters Committee , arose to present to delegates from all nations the news of the Rockefeller gift . It was a moment of some significance in the history of the United Nations , and it was significant , too , in the story of the third generation of Rockefellers , none of whom was present at - Lake Success . Its significance depended , however , not on the fact that their father happened to have enough money to make a gift of the land , but on the energies and talents of his five sons and their willingness to use them in behalf of what they believe to be the common good . It will be some time before history can judge the success of the United Nations in its gleaming skyscraper home in Manhattan , just as it will be some years before anyone can judge finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new economic pattern in underdeveloped areas or its effect , if any , on the position of the United States in world affairs . But win , lose or draw , the Rockefellers at least will have demonstrated that in a time nota-c ble for indecision and uncertainty they had the courage to try .
