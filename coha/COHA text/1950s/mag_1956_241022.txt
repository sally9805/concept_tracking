VENICE OBSERVED ( 199 pp. ) - Mary Mc-Carthy-Reynal ( $15 ) . <P> More than a century has passed since Byron swam from the Lido to Venice and through the Grand Canal ( four miles ) , and nearly two since Napoleon pronounced the pigeon-swept square of St. Mark 's " the best drawing-room in Europe . " But the destiny of Venice remains constant , to be " the observed of all observers . " The latest to succumb to the spell of the floating city is Critic and Novelist Mary McCarthy ( TIME , Nov. 14 , 1955 ) , who has fashioned the spectacle of Venice into a handsome and intelligent mosaic of art , history and personal impressions . Complete with 46 elegant color reproductions and more than 100 photographs , Venice Observed is a model travel book in that it heightens the reader 's perceptions and gives him a sense of place without sentimentally usurping the place of sense . <P> Observer McCarthy early admits that in Venice , appearance is reality : " The tourist Venice is Venice : the gondolas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quadri 's , Torcello , Harry 's Bar , Murano , Burano , the pigeons , the glass beads , the vaporetto . Venice is a folding picture-postcard of itself . " But Tourist McCarthy is no ordinary tourist . Whether she is discussing the merits of Titian , Tintoretto , Veronese , Bellini , Giorgione , or building up a rare head of social protest steam over the teen-age slaveys whose eyes are being ruined in the lace factory at Burano , her reflections bear the stamp of a rangy mind not to be fobbed off with commonplaces . To get the feel of Venice , she proceeds not by touch , but by touchstones . <P> Images of Money . Gold is one , the daemon of the Venetian genius , as Mary McCarthy sees it . Not only does it glint from painting , palazzo and cathedral , but from the hard surfaces of the Venetian mind as well . It was typical of the Venetians to sit out the first three Crusades except as close-bargaining transport agents . How explain the paradox , asks Author McCarthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they create a city of fantasy , lovely as a dream or a fairy tale ? " Her answer is as tantalizing as her question : " There is no contradiction , once you stop to think what images of beauty arise from fairy tales . They are images of money . Gold , caskets of gold , caskets of silver . . . the cave of Ali Baba stored with stolen gold and silver , the underground garden in which Aladdin found jewels growing on trees ... A wholly materialist city is nothing but a dream incarnate . Venice is the world 's unconscious : a miser 's glittering hoard . . . This is the spirit of the enchantment under which Venice lies , pearly and roseate , like the Sleeping Beauty , changeless throughout the centuries . " <P> Another touchstone is the mirror , developed by Venetian craftsmen . Observes Mary McCarthy : " The perennial wonder of Venice is to peer at herself in her canals and find that she exists-incredible as it seems . It is the same reassurance that a looking-glass offers us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its decay , Venice is frozen in a kind of narcissistic trance with each Venetian " a connoisseur of Venice , " and somehow slightly saddening in his obsessive concern with sacred artistic relics .
