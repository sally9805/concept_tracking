A report from Washington Stand of South Africa said we will be in the red this fiscal year ten billion dollars . Only recently Misrepresentation by U. N. Council of the Senate Finance Committee stated Government 's Policy Charged that we had reached the limit in tans To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your recent editorial on South-West Africa stated that the U. N. Trusteeship Committee in Paris was " again shadowboxing against a South Africa that wo n't even stay around to face the punishment . " Permit me to point out that until its delegation withdrew from the Trusteeship Committee a few days ago South Africa had indeed stayed around since the very first U. N. General Assembly session to take the abuse , misrepresentation and arrogance of many other countries whose own policies and domestic conditions will often not bear the light of day . It should not be surprising now that South Africa refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than lip service to the United Nations , and whose truculence , so boldly displayed against South Africa , fades before it reaches the battlefields of Korea . The South African Government 's refusal to submit annual administrative reports on South-West Africa is not , as you state , due to a bad conscience . It is a protest against the practice of making the consideration of such reports a ' holiday spree for every propagandist and publicity-seeker snatching the opportunity to throw a brickbat at the Union . Before the creation of the U. N. Trusteeship Council , South Africa for many years submitted comprehensive annual reports on its administration of the Territory to the Permanent Mandates Commission . The commission comprised men experienced in colonial administration who gave these reports unbiased consideration and who , if they were critical , were constructively critical . But instead of constructive criticism the Trusteeship Committee has , so far as South Africa is concerned , yielded little nitre than a consistently vicious type of misrepresentation . Your statement that " the ( African ) continent was theirs ( the natives ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the white citizens of South Africa are as indigenous to that country as the native Bantu themselves . Next year will be the tercentenary of the founding of the Cape settlement by the Dutch East India Company . After 1652 more than a century and a half elapsed before the Dutch and English settlers at the Cape , people of the same racial stocks which concurrently brought civilization to the American continent , made their first frontier contacts with the Bantu races then migrating southward . Our early settlers laid the foundations of a civilized outpost in " dark " Africa . that has endured for three hundred years . But when white South Africans express their determination to retain their identity as Europeans they are assailed as oppressors and racial fascists . Under our structure of civilization the natives of South Africa enjoy opportunities for advancement and betterment and for experience in local self-government on a scale not equaled anywhere else among the primitive peoples of Africa . But everything we have on the credit side is normally obscured by critics who cry " racism " with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , the United States . H. M. MOOLMAN , Director , South African Government Information Office . New York , Dec. 14 , 1951 . Social Security for Clergymen To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : THE NEW YORK TIMES report concerning the opposition of the Rev. Dr. Franklin Clark Fry to the including of clergymen under the coverage of Federal Social Security presents a most challenging problem . It is a matter of great concern to both laymen and clergy throughout the country , and considerable study has been given the problem by the organized church . In July of 1951 the Pension Department of the African Methodist Episcopal Church appointed a committee on federal security , and while its findings have not yet been reported it would seem that considerable sentiment exists for provision of a reasonable amount of Government-guaranteed security for the declining years of ministers . It is our feeling that , like all other workers in America , our ministers should have some degree of assurance that advancing age will not make of them public charges with no adequate income . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find some opposition to the extension of federal security benefits , much of it might be political . Certainly we are opposed to the idea of a " welfare state " that robs its citizens of initiative and destroys free enterprise and , individual initiative . Pensions for clergymen should be absolutely divorced from the principle of the separation of church and state . To cite this as a hazard is only to add confusion to the issue . We must not allow ourselves to re governed by a psychology of fear to the extent that we lose faith in our democratic way of life . The Government of the United States will maintain &; favorable attitude toward the church as long as the people of America want it that way . ( Bishop ) D. WARD NICHOLS . New York , Dec. 2 , 1951 . Aid to Eurone Opposed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As a subscriber to your paper for seventeen years I wish to comment on your editorial " More Economic Aid to Europe . " Where is this money coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the MarTo THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Tams : I have.read with much interest your excellent report on hawk shooting at Cape May in a recent issue of your conservation column . Following this and other reports an astonishing amount of interest has developed in Cape May 's migration flights . Several conservation groups recommended the establishment of the entire area south of the Cape May Canal as an inviolate wildlife sanctuary to protect these migration flights . Another move was the announcement of a plan by one group to introduce a bill in New Jersey to protect all hawks . Lying on one of the four great flyways of bird ' migration , Cape May is unique on the Atlantic coast , if not on the entire continent , for its fall concentrations of migrants , notably of land birds and hawks . Flying on a northwest wind , many of these birds are pushed into the funnel of Cape May , where , faced with the wide expanse of Delaware Bay , they wait for favorable winds to cross , creating a terrific concentration as first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these travelers never reach the Delaware shore , being left killed or wounded along the beaches of Cape May . There is a growing feeling among conservationists that flight lines and concentrations of birds on migration should not be used as a Hunting ground . This is particularly true in municipalities and townships where No Shooting ordinances are the rule rather than the exception . There has been quite a move of late toward the setting up of sanctuaries of one sort or another , and many municipalities have established them as a tourist attraction , such as Orlando 's famous and much-photographed concentration of wild ducks . Cape May may become one of the greatest of these sanctuaries . With its variety of birds it is a natural sanctuary , a sort of miniature avian Yellowstone , which should bring corresponding tourist benefits to its residents in the selling of food and lodging , of bird books and equipment and t ... e many items which go to make a tour:11 ; attraction .

Loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 11.4 : Your recent editorial on the dropping of the test oath at the University of California was highly commendable for its democratic spirit . But in applauding the decision of the Board of Regents you partially misrepresented the general nature of the situation here in California , as well as the reasons for the opposition to the Regents ' oath by members of the faculty at the university . The question of the loyalty oath is not , in truth , resolved in California . There is still the more widespread and inimical Levering Act , providing a conformity oath not only for teachers but for all state employes , in addition to a conscription clause designating all state employes as civil defense workers to be disposed of at the discretion of their superiors , without regard to previous qualifications ? or wage scales . Teachers at the university objected to the Regents ' oath because it was discriminatory , true , but also because it was contrary to articles of both the state and federal Constitutions . Many of them , even those who t have been COM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same objections against the Levering Act . People have been dia. possessed from their jobs for refusal to sign this oath , which is in every respect anathema to democracy . THE TIMES ' position on the disposi ? tion of the oath problem at the university indicates a general antipathy to conformity devices of all kinds . The Levering Act is such a device , and TIM TIMES editorial , intending to denounce such devices , communicates a sense of false security . The oath problem is still very much alive in California . People in the East , unaware of its dangers to them , should be so informed . HERBERT BLAI.1 ? instructor , Language Arts , San Fran . cisco State College .
