White flag in hand , a 28-year-old Chinese officer crossed into the allied lines one day last week , just bursting with talk . Lieutenant Fan Wei-ning cheerfully gave out vital facts on the officers and men in his division-their ages , their equipment , their battle plans . Then he asked for a map of the village where his division was based , and eagerly pinpointed supply dumps , command posts and gun positions . <P> Since the few Chinese officers captured by U.N . forces in Korea have generally been closemouthed , U.N . interrogation officers wanted to know why Fan was being so talkative . Fan was glad to explain . Last May , he found three Chinese WACs in the division to which he was assigned as " entertainment officer " ( i.e. , a job somewhere between U.S.O. director and political commissar ) . " One , " he said , " was a beautiful young girl named Toy . We fell in love . It was not at all bad being so far away from home under those conditions . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Fan and Toy seldom saw each other ; the commander staggered their duty hours so that one was always on duty when the other was free . Fan stuck it as long as he could . " Finally , " he said , " I decided to desert . " <P> Just as Fan was being led from the tent in which his interrogation took place , he stopped , returned to the map , studied it intently for a minute , and then marked it with a neat cross to guide U.N . artillery . " That , " said Fan , " is where the division commander lives . "
