 | MALAYA the Forgotten War Condensed from Life I N MALAYA the war is like a mist : it pervades everywhere ; it saps the spirits ; it wo n't clear . It is partly a question of geography . Malaya steams away under almost daily rainfall , sapping the energy of tired , overworked men , too few for the jobs that the emergency ( the government does not officially call it a war ) has produced . And the situation shows no sign of ever reaching a climax . There is just a daily drip of casualties : a few civilians killed . a guerrilla camp destroyed . The nature of this war has been little understood abroad . It is not a nationalist war ; 95 percent of the enemy combatants are Chinese . We British are not fighting to hold down Malaya ; we are fighting a straightforward war against Communism . The armed enemy forces are estimated at between 3000 and 5000 . These men are the commandos of Communism , organized like a Russian division , with their political branches , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . No one knows where their GHQ lies ? perhaps in one of the cities , Singapore ,  | Kuala Lumpur , Malacca ? but the leader is known . He fought the Japanese in World War II and marched in the Victory Parade in London . For security reasons he can not be named . You can not measure the enemy 's strength by the few thousand fighters who emerge from the jungle to shoot up a car or a patrol , to murder a planter , to derail a train . Their real strength lies in the unarmed combatants of the ground organization known as the Min Yuen , which probably numbers at least roo , 000 . Its main responsibility is supply , but it is employed also for intelligence , propaganda and liaison work , and it is responsible for the suspicion which rises everywhere like the mist from the saturated Malayan soil . Do n't mention what time you are leaving on the telephone ? the operator may be a member of the Min Yuen . Do n't talk about your movements in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that young resettlement officer they killed last month ? He had told his Chinese taxi girl where he was going next day . The Communist commandos lurk in the jungle , which explains how they can hold out against ioo , 000 Malayan police and 25,000 British , Gurkha and Malay troops . One must spend a few days in the Malayan jungle to realize its difficulties . Its density restricts movement to perhaps a mile an hour . Visibility is sometimes 20 feet . Almost every day water pours down upon it , making the steep , slippery slopes of the innumerable hills a cruel effort to climb . One is never dry . When you pause for a halt on the march you see the leeches make for your boots  - -  thin matchsticks looping with blind purpose across the wet leaves , later to swell into fat gray slugs if they find an opening in your clothing . And always there is the jungle stench ? the heavy odor of decaying vegetation . It clings to your clothes . When you come out of it , your friends will avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Communist commandos is to ruin the country economically , and the wealth of Malaya is chiefly tin and rubber . A tin mine is relatively easy to defend , and so the main attack is directed against the rubber planter . Take X. He lives with his wife in a small house of two floors surrounded by barbed wire , the ground lit at night by searchlights as far as the first trees . He is a man of late middle age , a former prisoner of the Japanese , who might about now have been looking forward to the final , more prosperous years . But the life that remains for him is very different . His assistant was murdered on the estate some months ago , and he can not get another . Night and day the telephone rings at half-hour intervals from the nearest village to make sure the line has not been cut and that he can communicate if attacked . He was ambushed last year a mile from his house but shot his way out . When he moves outside the wire , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he carries a Sten gun over his arm an automatic pistol on his hip and two hand grenades at his belt . Who can be surprised if he drinks a brandy and ginger ale for break -- fist instead of coffee ? " Dutch courage , " he says , pushing the starter of the little inadequately armored car and moving slowly out at the blind corner past which the road to the village runs and where one day , 11 um the jungle opposite , a Sten in will almost certainly open fire . in the village he visits the ambiguous Chinese shopkeeper who buys his rubber ? and perhaps reports his movements . His business done , he drives back along the lonely two , mile stretch , slows down at the turn before that jungle wall , ten seconds of stretched nerves , and then the false security of the rubber plantation , where death is just as likely to happen but where at least you can see it coming . Perhaps he is half an hour late and his wife waits with the anger of love for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder of three more planters . One of the British units operating in Malaya is the Gurkha Rifles . The enemy distinguishes between the Gurkhas and its other opponents . A captured intelligence report describes British troops as courageous but noisy , the Gurkhas as ferocious and silent . The Gurkha is a mercenary . His vocation is to kill his official enemy , and perhaps because he has a genuine vocation he is extremely tractable . The Gurkhas give their British officers absolute loyalty , and their officers return them a quality of love you will not find in any other unit . The RAF had bombed an area , and 200 Communist commandos were believed to be milling around somewhere within certain squares marked on the map . A platoon of 14 Gurkhas under a British officer was ordered to reconnoiter part of the area . They took me along . We struck straight out through the thin belt of rubber , into the jungle . There was an interminable succession of hills , with slimy , muddy , 45-degree slopes . A Gurkha patrol works by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crow flies , but far less comfortably . If you patrol by paths you avoid the worst hills which sometimes rise in this area to 2000 feet , and you never have to carve your way through the undergrowth , but you are staking all on finding tracks on the one path you follow . The Gurkha technique means that in the course of a day you cut across many paths in your search for signs of the enemy ; a newly broken bamboo may be the only indication . After two and a half days ' heavy marching and scrambling with no result but the discovery of two abandoned camps , one emerges just nine miles from where one started  - -  - and another button can be added to the map in the operations room , that is all . Routine patrol , routine leeches , routine fatigue and stench . In the Malayan war the real suc-  | cesses may never be recognized , and defeat is in the minds of men . You can not win this war by military forces ; with the jungle against you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most important weapon is starvation . No one can subsist on the jungle , and any large cultivated area will be spotted sooner or later by air reconnaissance . It is here that the Briggs Plan , proposed by Lt. Gen. Sir Harold Briggs , the Director of Operations , offers hope . The main source of the terrorists ' food supply is the Chinese squatter areas  - -  patches of unauthorized cultivation on the edge of the jungle . The squatters are not necessarily Communist sympathizers , but who of us would refuse food to a terrorist at the point of a bayonet ? Following the Briggs Plan , these squatters are being brought together into new villages which can be surrounded by wire and properly policed . The old huts are burned . The squatters are provided with building materials or houses , a small sum of money and title to their land . But there are about 400,000 squatters to settle ; there is a shortage of wire and transport , a shortage of police for guarding the settlement . There is sometimes a defeatism on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed unchallenged through a wired-in village , both gates wide open , at two in the morning . The European officer , when this was reported to him , shrugged . What difference did it make ? You could n't keep the Communists out with a bit of wire . This is what I mean by defeat in the mind . Even if the Briggs Plan is success fully accomplished this year the war will go on . Nearly half the popula tion of Malaya is Chinese , and the Chinese have settled in the land to make money ; a dead man can not earn and it is always best to be on the winning side . If you are a bus owner you will pay blackmail to the Communists rather than have your buses burned ; if you are a rubber tapper you will pay a proportion of your wages ( you will have heard how Tan Lee on the next estate was found with his throat cut ) . Some of the wealthiest Chinese businessmen in Malaya are believed to be supplying funds . Every town can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk is a little greater than in the squatter area that is all . In some places the terrorists will be able to depend on the inertia of the native police . I have watched a road check in progress . The check consisted simply of a constable taking a glance at a driver 's papers and passing his truck through without a look at the contents . We are fighting in Malaya with blunted weapons . Nonetheless the Briggs Plan  - -  taking the most pessimistic view of it is a turn of the screw of discomfort . Living in the jungle on the bare margin of subsistence , the enemy can not stand much more privation : struck from the air , hunted by patrols , bled by the leeches , with in-  | sufficient food and medicines , their success measured in a resettlement officer or a planter killed , a bus timed , a patrol ambushed , a Stela run captured . The nights are long in the jungle . By six it is dark except thr the shine of phosphorescent eaves ; by midnight the rain will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain will continue to drip from the reservoirs of foliage . There will be nearly 12 hours of virtual darkness , and even Marx must pall . Here is the opportunity for another weapon which we have only recently begun to wield : the attack on the mind . These men live by hope ? hope that in perhaps six months , a year , Chinese forces will he pressing into Malaya through Siam , that instead of being a few hunted platoons in the jungle they will emerge as the seasoned spearhead of the invasion . News of a Western defeat in Korea is worth a hundred successful ambushes to these men . We have to weaken their hope , and we have to destroy their confidence in each other . Surrender leaflets on waterproof paper ? leaflets showing the faces of their dead comrades , the unpeaceful features , the hanging mouth , the unclosed eye ( " Would you rather be dead like these ? " ) and scenes of the quiet life in the city , at the restaurant , the motion-picture theater , the park ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; rewards for the betrayal of their own comrades , the rewards for some of the high officers running up to more than woo U. S. dollars these leaflets are dropped in thousands from airplanes , left by patrols at old camp sites in the jungle . Thousands are wasted but a few ge home . Already deserters have come in carrying surrender leaflets . One is haunted by the thought that all these measures are shortterm ones . If we forced the surrender of 5000 Communists by starvation , would it really be the end ? The idea of Communism would remain and sooner or later the jungle would be alive again with secret inhabitants . Communism is a threat to the rich , but the poor and illiterate have nothing to lose . There is one who is threatened by Communism , whether he is rich or poor , educated or peasant , and that is the Christian . The other day at Phat Diem , in the north of IndoChina , I watched the Viet Namese Catholic bishop inspect his outposts , the unpaid militia who held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 of these men and there were not enough uniforms to go round , but I would have felt more confidence fighting in their ranks than in the ranks of the too , 000 armed Malay police . For their strength was an idea , and that idea love of their country . Christianity , too , is a form of patriotism . These Viet Namese belonged to the City of God and were proud of their city that lay behind the no man 's land of rice . " You see , " I wanted to say to my friends in Malaya , " it can be done . " An idea was fighting an idea .
