Han Jun Myung , 44 , is a minister of the Jesus Church of Korea in Wonsan . A few days after the war began , he suggested in a sermon that the problem of unifying Korea should be turned over to the U.N . Three days later Han was thrown into a Wonsan prison along with 500 other political suspects . <P> Early one morning last week , as the Communists were being driven out of Wonsan by South Korean troops , Han Jun Myung and about 300 other prisoners were called out of their cells , marched up a nearby hill and pushed into a large cave . As soon as the prisoners were all in the cave , the Communists began firing . Bullets killed the men on the right &; left of Han , tore through his clothing , but did not touch him . The Communists blasted the entrance to the cave , but failed to close it entirely . For two days Han remained in the cave , then crawled out to meet South Korean liberators . <P> Han 's story was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating Communist atrocities in Korea . To back up the stories , there were bullet-riddled bodies : in Wonsan , 500.
