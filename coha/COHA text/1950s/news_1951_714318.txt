txt To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I should like to agree with Erwin D. Canham , editor of The Christian Science Monitor , that " the United States has the true revolution , while Soviet Russia is reactionary , " but I fear that Soviet Russia and the Communists will . not agree with him and will continue their own revolution against the so-called " American reactionary imperialism . " Moreover , the fatal question of our times is not who is , the true " l'art pour l'art " revolutionary , as Mr. Canham and many other American politicians , writers and propagandists imagine ; rather , it is who can offer a peaceful solution of the world situation , including the social , economic and cultural problems . A ' kind of political , economic and military game exists between the United States and Russia . The Soviet , through the Cominform , Communistdominated trade unions , influenced intellectuals , the awakening colonial peoples and their " liberty fighting , " keeps the world in a troubled state . The professionally led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know what they must do and precisely when to do it . Bad Ideological Fighter It is true that America has a revolutionary tradition , and there is in America a very interesting revolution of technology and production joined with democratic institutions . Yet America is a bad ideological fighter in the international arena : first , because " Americanism " is not a commodity for export America does not want to influence the self-determination of other nations , and , second , , even if she did want to , she lacks the methods of dynamic revolutionary activity . America , With financial and military aid , wants to revive the Western World and protect it from communism . Since the Second World War she has given to West Europe and the Communistthreatened countries $32.7 billions , and will now give an additional $7.5 billions by the Mutual Security Act of 1951 , England received many billions to build up socialism ; now Churchill may get several billions more to rebuild capitalism . France was able to reconstruct her economy , but her political anarchy and the Communist menace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France now faces a serious crisis and has her hand out again . The situation is the same ip Italy , albeit without colonial problems , and the future Germany is a big question mark . Franco found his share useful ' to re-energize fascism , and Tito continues his own type of communism in Yugoslavia . China fell with $3 billion , Nehru is " indifferent , " the Moslem world flirts with Stalin , and Japan is also an enigma . Search foriNew Way The exigency of supporting these contradictory forms is not the fault or mistake of American policy . It ? only shows that the crisis of the Western World lies much deeper , than we think , There is a tragic split ; the Western man can still work but can not believe . This ideological vacuum , the hopeless , goalless , bitter nihil , is the real Fifth Column . Old men hold in their hands the parts of the disintegrating West and try to fit them together in military , economic and possible political frames . The " Old Guard " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overworked lives reflects on a dissatisfied new generation , which is searching for a new way but has not yet found it . The world needs new ideas and spirit , full political and economic coordination , and total social security . Politicians , propagandists and military men alone can not approach the problems and find a solution . It is high " time to call together the sociologists , psychologists , philosophers ; economists and technicians to formulate the principles of a new world . If Americanism were based on the modern theories and could present to the world the most advanced technical forms , production and administration methods , with full freedom and democracy , it could then be the complete " revolutionary " solution instead of " reactionary " bolshevism .

The Railroad Crisis To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Just a line to say thank you for the editorial headed " A New Railroad Crisis , " which appeared in your newspaper on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firemen and Enginemen , of which organization I have been a member for over half a century and am now the vice president-national legislative representative , I wish to express my appreciation for the manner in which you have penetrated the reasons underlying our wage dispute with the railroads .

Comparison of Income Figures To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your editorial of Dec. 9 " Contrasts in World Income , " dealing with the great inequalities of per capita income in various parts of the world , you point out that comparisons of income figures are not always meaningful . Especially in countries where there are great extremes in the wealth of the few and the poverty of the many national averages of annual income are completely useless as a gauge of standards of living , Take the Sheikhdom of Kuwait , for instance . This is a small country on the Persian . Gulf , with an estimated total population of 150,000 . A few days ago we read in THE TIMES that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the oil company operating in Kuwait , according to which the Sheikh will now receive an annual income of $150 millions in oil revenues . This in itself will put the per capita national income of Kuwait at $1,000 ? second only to the North American figure  --  without counting any additional income earned by the Kuwait population . In reality , however , all this enormills wealth remains concentrated in the hands of the Sheikh , while his 150,000 subjects continue to lead a pre ? carious existence on an annual per capita income of probably less than $50 . The Sheikh of Kuwait happens to be a liberal and benevolent ruler Who has already announced important plans for improvements in the social and health conditions of his people , to be financed from his oil revenues . But the fact remains that the per capita national income figure of Kuwait , and of other countries at a similar stage of socioeconomic development , is utterly mean . ingless .

New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Restricting Athletics to University Is Defended To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES I ' In the issue of Dec. 3 THE NEW YORK TIMES carried a release of the National Education Association regarding the unsavory status of college athletics and offering some general principles for the guidance of those to whom college athletics are entrusted . Referring to Georgetown University , THE TIMES article states : " The association warned , however , that abolition of college sports was not a good answer and criticized Georgetown University for doing so . It said that Georgetown had lost a golden opportunity and that the Jesuit institution ' might well have taken the lead ? ership in placing football on a sound and healthy basis . ' " These statements need clarification . Georgetown has not dropped college , sports  --  not even college football . While no longer engaging in intercollegiate football competition ( due primarily to financial deficits ) , Georgetown sponsors an intramural football league . Judging from the increased number of students now participating in the sport , the zest and spirit of the teams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and songs at the pre-game prep rallies , and the games themselves , it is clear that Georgetown has not " lost a golden opportunity " but rather created one . It has given the game back to the students , where , of old , it originated . It is rather contradictory for the National Education Association to criticize such a program , for it carries out the very suggestions of the association itself for conducting college athletics on a sane basis . These suggestions include : " ( 1 ) Eliminate commercialism of college athletics ; ( 2 ) Increase the confidence of faculties and citizens in the use of college resources and in the financial administration of athletic programs ; ( 3 ) Preserve and strengthen the character-building opportunities in all parts of the athletic program . " Furthermore , Georgetown 's position is very much in line with a joint state ? ment recently issued by the presidents of Yale , Harvard and Princeton . In part , it reads : " The athletic program exists for the welfare of the student , for the contribution it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glorification of the individual or the prestige or profit of the college . " Georgetown 's present policy is certainly " placing football on a sound basis . " It cuts off the primary source from which the most serious evils and scandals of present-day college athletics have originated . This is the market place , where the all-city or all-state athlete , surrounded by a dozen or more college coaches and a like number of bona fide or subway alumni , usually succumbs to the highest bidder . If the National Education AtESCMUIP tion or any other representative organ . ization has sufficient influence or au ? thority to rid the market place of this scourge it will have accomplished two outstanding services . It will have removed the taint of professionalism from the colleges themselves . It will , have instilled a greater sense of honor and loyalty in the individual athletes , making them less susceptible to the lure of the professional gambler and racketeer in betraying their alma mater . C1IARLES J. FOLEY , S. J. , Director , Office of University Development . Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In this age of awareness for minority rights there exists on our own roads a minority group whose situation . has grown worse at the hands of the majority . I speak of the bicyclists ot this country . They are the recipients of abusive horn-sounding , exhaust fumes , and near side-swipes by the more arrogant drivers . Apparently there are motorists who consider the automobile to be the only legitimate form of highway traffic . When one realizes that a car occupies about fifteen times as much road surface as a cyclist on a bicycle the attitude of these drivers seems indeed to be a selfish one . If they would keep in mind the fact that the person who travels " by his own steam " is equally entitled to use of the road as the one who propels himself by a light step on the accelerator pedal , the cyclist might enjoy the pleasure of an afternoon 's ride which these motorists would deny him .
