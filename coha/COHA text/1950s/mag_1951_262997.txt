In Father 's Footsteps The full name of the little Dutch girl was Annie Caroline Pontifex Toorop , but her masterful painter-father Jan soon cut it down to plain " Charley " - explaining that he just liked the name . Father Jan was less masterful in his attempts to make Charley study art ; she determined to study music instead . But Jan Toorop won in the end : when Charley 's marriage broke up , leaving her with three small children to raise , she turned to painting to help make ends meet . <P> Last week a retrospective show of 146 oils , sketches and prints in The Hague 's Municipal Museum showed why some Dutch critics consider 60-year-old Charley Toorop " one of today 's most important figures in Dutch or perhaps even European painting . " <P> At first Charley combined baby-sitting with her painting , turned out glowing portraits of her own children . But she got bored with the soft outlines and warm colors of the nursery , went outside into the cold , hard northern light . Soon she was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptural , hard-bitten portraits of Rotterdam prostitutes , rugged Low Country peasants and miners as well as artists and intellectuals . <P> Charley 's cluttered waterfront scenes are a far cry from Vermeer 's luminous View of Delft , her masklike portraits a long jump from Rembrandt . Nonetheless , Charley rightfully considers most of her painting " very Dutch , " especially the group portraits where full-lipped , wide-eyed Hollanders stare thoughtfully into space as they might have from the paintings of the 17th Century masters . Like the old masters Charley admires most , she also does endless self-portraits . One of the outstanding pictures in her current show is Three Generations , a marble-cold , unflattering studio portrait of herself and her artist-son Edgar Fernhout , with an ominous bronze bust of her father lowering darkly over their shoulders . <P> Although three strokes have left her partially paralyzed and barely able to speak , Charley still spends two hours a day painting in her scrupulously neat studio in the Dutch town of Bergen . " I 'm never afraid , " she says in her painful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work interests me. "
