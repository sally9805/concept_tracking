One steaming July day in 1873 , representatives of some 30 Jewish congregations met in Cincinnati to make a historic break with Orthodox Judaism . They formed themselves into a society to be known as the Union of American Hebrew Congregations , dedicated , as they saw it , to a newer , more contemporary vision of the Jewish faith . In Manhattan last week , U.S. Reform Judaism celebrated the 80th anniversary of this birthday. * More than 3,000 delegates from 465 Reform temples were on hand ; the five-day conference of U.A.H.C. was the largest Jewish religious gathering in U.S. history . <P> The assembled rabbis and laymen had more than growth to be pleased about . In their own eyes , Reform has done much to wipe out the sense of deep separation from the rest of U.S. life which , they believe , long characterized the Jewish community . But recent years have seen a kind of reform of Reform-a movement away from a liberalism which was sometimes hardly distinguishable from Unitarianism . At last week 's convention , Dr. Emanuel Gamoran , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper recognition of the Jewish past . <P> The Magic Formula . " Classical Reform , " he said , " detached God from Israel , thinking that it could achieve a greater measure of sanctity by concentrating on the idea of God . . . The opposite was the result . . . We have only succeeded in breaking the magic formula which , throughout the centuries , served effectively to maintain the Jewish people as well as Judaism , . . We now realize that if our Jewish education is to be effective , it must begin with the Jewish people , and it must include Torah . " <P> Rabbi Philip S. Bernstein of Temple Brith Kodesh in Rochester called for more religion in Reform Judaism , even though it be at the expense of social action . " Hitherto , " he said , " we have concentrated on defending ourselves against bigots and supporting our brethren overseas . . . Now the American Jewish community is becoming free to give primacy to the task of making itself a strong moral force in this country . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new temper of Reform were the findings of a survey conducted by the National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods . Items : Three laymen in ten-and half the rabbis-now feel that their congregations should have more ritual and ceremony . There has been a marked increase in use of the ceremony of bar mizvah to admit young men to full membership in the congregation . <P> A substantial number of laymen ( 34% ) report that they and their families now observe Passover for the traditional eight days . <P> So clearly did the survey indicate a revived interest in the old Jewish forms that its sponsors felt it necessary to point out that this was not to be interpreted as a swing to Orthodoxy : " It is not the will of God that dictates what the Reform Jews shall practice . . . but what the Reform Jew feels his will to serve God justifies him in doing . . . Reform is a religion of choice . . . Orthodoxy is a religion of divine command . " <P> <P> *Though the first U.S. Reform congregation was founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
