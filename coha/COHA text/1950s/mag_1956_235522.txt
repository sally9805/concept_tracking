In Moscow last September West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer made a bargain . Longtime traffickers in human souls , the Communists offered to ship some 10,000 prisoners of war home to Germany , if Adenauer would accept one Russian . Like Faust 's bargain with the devil , the deal was calculated to make <P> Germany only momentarily happy . Last week , as perhaps the last installment of prisoners came back from Soviet slave camps , Adenauer got his Russian : 53-year-old Valerian Aleksandrovich Zorin , first Soviet Ambassador to West Germany . <P> Softspoken , grey-haired Zorin has the diplomatic manner , often makes cracks about uncultured and unimportant comrades , deftly turns difficult conversation into innocuous channels when it suits him . Said a German diplomat who met him last week : " If you did n't know differently , you would think he was from Denmark or Sweden , or perhaps Canada . His face is animated and kind . " In short , Zorin is one of the few Russian diplomats who is readily distinguishable from his bodyguard . But behind the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadliest minds in diplomacy . <P> He was born near Rostov in the Don Cossack country and he came up the hard way , through the Young Communist League to Moscow 's Marx-Engels Institute and a Communist teaching job . In 1941 he was assigned to the Soviet Foreign Office , and two years later he was head of the division dealing with central Europe . His biggest coup took place in 1948 , when he masterminded the Communist seizure of Czechoslovakia . While maintaining a smiling relationship with President Benes , Zorin gathered together a team of Moscow-trained Communists and helped to organize the " action committees " that bored into every section of Czech life . After the coup he returned to Moscow , but was back in Prague three years later to supervise the liquidation of Rudolf Slansky and a score of other top Czech Communists on Stalin 's suspect list . <P> In 1952 , when Zorin went to New York as chief Soviet delegate to the U.N. , he wore plain grey business suits and horn-rimmed spectacles , and gold flashed in his smile . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker at an executives ' convention . " Plain Mrs. Zorin wore mink . Despite such appearances , Zorin 's attacks on the U.S. were ruthless and uncompromising . <P> In Bonn last week , Zorin moved into the Villa Hentzen , onetime home of a 19th century Cologne millionaire , on the west bank of the Rhine opposite Chancellor Adenauer 's home . But a mile upstream he had carpenters working feverishly , repairing an old hotel for his staff of 45 Russians , who are also part of the devil 's bargain .
