( See Cover ) <P> As the He de France , stately and beautiful , came up New York Bay , one of her prominent passengers , * a five-star general of France with a faint battle scar on his left cheek , had a particular wish . The general wanted a picture of himself with the Statue of Liberty as backdrop . The massed press photographers were glad to oblige . General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny , impeccable from kepi to pigskin gloves , turned his hawklike profile to the lenses and pointed theatrically toward his country 's copper gift to the U.S. <P> It was a deliberately significant gesture : the general had freedom-and mutual aid-very much in mind . During the past nine months in Indo-China . as French <P> High Commissioner and commander in chief , he has been fighting one of freedom 's bloodiest and most crucial battles . He had left the front to come to the U.S. on an urgent mission : to see the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , and get more U.S. aid for Indo-China , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> To Manhattan newsmen , General de Lattre read a statement in English : " The war in Indo-China is not a colonial war , it is a war against Red colonialism ; as in Korea , it is a war against Communist dictatorship . France has assumed the burden of the war in Indo-China at a tremendous cost to her manpower and financial resources . . . We are fighting on a world battlefield , for liberty and for peace . . . " <P> De Lattre knows the cost of the fight and the weight of the burden : the band of mourning on his sleeve and his wife 's severe black dress testified to that . Only four months ago their only son , Bernard , 23 , an infantry lieutenant , was killed on the Indo-China front . <P> The " Dirty " War . The Indo-China war has been dragging on for six years . It started as a slow guerrilla nuisance , with none of the dramatic shock of the Red attack in Korea , and at first the free world , including France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indo-Chinese Reds , led by a wily , veteran Communist , Ho Chi Minh , pretended with some success to be patriotic nationalists , rising against the yoke of French imperialism . In France itself , Communists and fellow travelers loudly berated " the dirty war , " sneered at their countrymen who returned from the Indo-China theater , and sabotaged arms shipments to the French forces - then only a few thousand professional soldiers defending blockhouses in a far-off jungle against an elusive , nearly invisible enemy . Frenchmen had little interest in Indo-China until De Lattre helped persuade them that it was important . <P> The war with Ho turned Indo-China into a ledger of death and liability . In six years the French army in Indo-China lost 31,000 killed and missing . Today , 240,000 men , amounting to a third of France 's armed forces , are tied down in the war against the Red Viet Minh-which means that , until that war is over , they are lost to Western Europe 's defense .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
