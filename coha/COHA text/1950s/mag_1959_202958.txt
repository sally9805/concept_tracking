Frol 's Frolic <P> Sir : <P> I 'm doing a slow burn ! Mr. Kozlov and his Commie friends are allowed to inspect our nuclear-powered merchant vessels under construction , and with their high-powered cameras take pictures of everything in sight July 20 . Do we have to make it so easy for them ? <P> <P> MRS . EDWARD R. SETH Baltimore <P> Sir : <P> Hurrah for peaceful coexistence . This cultural exchange is wonderful . The country with the best ideas will win . <P> <P> MARY LEARSON <P> Conway , N.H. <P> <P> Sir : <P> From me , an American citizen , to Frol Kozlov , I say : take all your hot-air agents , sympathizers , and scram . <P> J. S. BURDETT Miami <P> Sir : <P> Your July 13 cover story on Soviet First Deputy Premier Frol Kozlov 's official visit to this country seems excessively cynical , sarcastic and vindictive-like the reaction of the fairy-tale witch whose mirror of truth began telling her that she was no longer the fairest in the land . It will do us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining on us in all fields and will continue to do so , regardless of TIME 'S neurotic reactions . <P> <P> CHARLES H. McGuiRE <P> Brooklyn <P> The Long Long Trail <P> Sir : <P> I write to you to express my admiration for your July 13 article on Earl Long . It is an exceptionally fine piece of reporting , evoking all the seemingly unbelievable Faulknerian overtones of the situation . <P> <P> EDWARD H. LE ZOTTE Frankfurt , West Germany <P> Sir : <P> As a citizen of the state of Louisiana , I respect the laws and my state , but the behavior of the Governor is appalling . <P> <P> MRS . LEE ROY MORESI Maplewood , La . <P> <P> Sir : <P> It is not Governor Earl Long who has disgraced the State of Louisiana , but rather the voters of that state who have continually re-elected him . <P> <P> MRS . JOAN C. RUSSELL Bethesda , Md . <P> The Nature of Beauty <P> Sir : <P> Prelate Byrne 's threatened denial of the sacraments of communion and confession to a Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another very good reason for being an American Protestant . <P> <P> H. WILLIAM OHMAN Staten Island , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Methinks perhaps Archbishop Byrne has misconstrued an adjective or two . Since the issue concerns international beauty , and since beauty in its essence " pleasurably exalts the mind or spirit , " can beauty and indecency possibly be related ? <P> If sacraments would be denied should Sue Ingersoll appear in public , then what justifies their being administered should she appear to a smaller-sized public ? Uncovered is uncovered , where'er it may be . <P> <P> NADINE MARIE CALHOUN <P> Santa Rosa , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Good for the archbishop ! He is one of the few remaining individuals who realize that true beauty is enhanced by maidenly modesty and womanly dignity . <P> He sees through the vulgarity and flesh worship of the public parading of the body . <P> <P> MRS . F. LAVELLE Pittsburgh <P> Case of the Chief Justice <P> Sir :              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
