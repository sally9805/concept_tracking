As the harvest of the new wheat crop began in Texas and Oklahoma last week , Department of Agriculture officials started to worry . Where will the U.S. put the wheat ? <P> <P> Already in storage is a huge carryover of 575 million bushels of wheat and 800 million bushels of corn . With the winter wheat crop estimated at 750 million bushels and the corn at 3.1 billion bushels , some officials predicted a repetition of the 1949 glut , when stacks of wheat had to be left out on open fields . To try to make room , agriculture officials are storing wheat in 75 mothballed ships on the Hudson River and in 50 more on the James River at Norfolk , Va . <P> Last week Under Secretary of Agriculture True D. Morse called an emergency conference on corn-storage problems in Des Moines and urged farmers to build more storage bins of their own . Said he : " We are moving forward on the premise that grain storage should not be run by the Government . It should be stored . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be handled by commercial people ... I fear that if the Government must resort to buying bins and putting them up to store corn , we will have to look at the bins in the future as monuments to the failure of free enterprise . " <P> In the grain country , Morse 's statement was coldly received . The grain men thought the Government should provide storage facilities , as it has for years . Storing wheat is especially attractive to farmers now that the spread between the market price of wheat and the Government-loan price is the greatest on record . The farmer could sell his wheat in Chicago last week for around $2.04 a bushel . But if he stored it , he could borrow $2.54 from the Government , pledging the grain as security . If prices do not rise , he can let the Government take his wheat . One hitch : grain is eligible for support only if it is stored in Government-approved places . <P> The following day , Morse got word of the grumbling in the grain belt . Mindful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of storage facilities , Morse hastily " clarified " his staement . The Government , he said , has no intention of getting ' out of the storage business right away , may even buy more bins to handle this year 's wheat and corn urpluses . He pointed out that it would be " good business " for the farmer to build more storage capacity , so that he could have the grain on hand and ready to market if the price went up . Furthermore , the Government was ready to lend 80% of the cost of the new bins built by the farmer , and would pay him 13 a bushel for storing last years corn for another year . <P> To demonstrate that " freeing butter from support prices would immediately double consumption and completely solve the butter problem , " Albert Lowenfels president of Manhattan 's Hotel Bar Butter Co. , staged a one-day butter sale af a Manhattan supermarket last week . Price set : 55 a lb. , the level to which Lowenfels thinks butter would go if left unsupported , compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day : 4 , 9751bs. , against average Friday sales of 600 Ibs . Net loss to Lowenfels to prove his point : about $2,300.
