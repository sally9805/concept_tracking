A last-minute added attraction staged by a performer who previously had been most unwilling to get into the act stole the show at the A.M.A. convention . The star : the American Cancer Society 's Statistician Edward Cuyler Hammond . His show-stopping material : figures proving that heavy cigarette smokers die younger than non-smokers-mainly from heart disease and cancer , notably cancer of the lung . <P> Dr. ( of Science ) Hammond , Yale professor of biostatistics , was little moved when Drs . Evarts Graham and Ernest Wynder reported their conclusion that long-term cigarette smoking can cause lung cancer ( TIME , March 7 , 1949 et seq . ) . Nothing proved , he said shortly , and went on smoking cigarettes . So did his assistant , Dr. Daniel Horn . But all the while Hammond and Horn were gathering deadly data . They had taken careful smoking histories of 187,766 white men , aged 50 to 69 , in 394 counties in nine states , and were keeping track of them to see what killed them . Hammond and Horn figured it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wagged warning fingers at conclusion-jumpers . <P> But after only a year and a half , 4,854 men had died , and the causes noted on death certificates caught Hammond 's eye . He asked A.M.A. to put him on its convention program . A.M.A. said no . So Hammond gave A.M.A. bigwigs a sneak preview of his figures ; they promptly changed their minds and gave him a top billing for the opening day 's scientific sessions . <P> Pack-a-Day Deal . Among the 4,854 deaths , Hammond told a packed house , were 745 men who daily smoked a pack of cigarettes or more . Their death rate was almost twice as high as that of the men who never smoked . There were 334 deaths from diseases of the coronary arteries , and this again represented a death rate almost double that of nonsmokers . There were 161 deaths from cancer , and this was 2 times the rate among nonsmokers . <P> On the question which had started the whole ruckus- " Does cigarette smoking eventually cause lung cancer ? " - the statisticians had to hedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain . But on the basis of gleanings to date , they concluded that death from lung cancer is three to nine times as common among cigarette smokers as among nonsmokers , and five to 16 times as common among those who smoke a pack a day or more . <P> No less striking were the statisticians ' findings that even the most moderate cigarette smokers ( half a pack or less a day ) also showed significantly higher death rates from both heart disease and cancer than nonsmokers , and that the increase includes all types of cancer , not only in the lung . Cigar and pipe smokers show no consistent increase in mortality . There is less chain-smoking of cigarettes in rural than urban areas , and the rural death rates from heart disease and cancer are lower . <P> " A Positive Theory . " No one piece of evidence taken alone proves a cause-and-effect relationship between smoking and these higher death rates , said Dr. Hammond . But , he went on , every bit of evidence so far available fits the hypothesis that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistical sanctuary , Hammond and Horn went out on a limb : " It is our opinion that regular cigarette smoking causes an increase in death rates from heart disease and cancer . We now advance this as a positive theory . "
