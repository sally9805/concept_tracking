The sun shone on Des Moines , but Philadelphia wallowed in rain and mud . The weather thus helped hang a big question mark over the year 's first major outdoor Olympic track &; field warmups-the Drake and Pennsylvania Relays . <P> In Philadelphia , most fans assumed that Milers Don Gehrmann , Fred Wilt and Warren Druetzler would run a three-way duel while the rest of the field watched their spikes . But Gehrmann and Druetzler proved no mudders and , though Wilt sloshed along valiantly , Purdue 's Denis Johansson , 23 , splashed past the leaders on the last lap , all but floated across the finish line to win by 10 yards over Wilt . Johansson 's time ( 4:18.2 ) was understandably slow . The real rub : Purdue 's Johansson might easily repeat or better his performance at Helsinki this summer-and , as a Finnish citizen , he will be running for his own country . <P> The Drake Relays offered some consolation to America 's Olympic mile hopes . The University of Kansas four-mile relay team set a U.S. college record ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying anchor man , Sophomore Wes Santee , turned in a spectacular ( but unofficial ) 4:07.5 mile . Next day , as if to prove it was no accident , Santee did it again , ran his mile .1 sec. faster to help his distance medley ( 440 , 880 , mi. , mile ) team set a meet record . The question , Gehrmann and Wilt to one side : Could Santee have beaten Johansson , rain or shine ? The answer may be important in the Olympics . <P> <P> Philadelphia 's slush permitted no record-smashing , but Princeton 's Albin Rauch won the 400-meter hurdles in 53.3 sec. , a time that would look good even under blue skies . <P> Other record-setters at Des Moines : The University of Kansas ' Bob de Vinney , the 440-yd. hurdles in 52.4 sec . The University of Illinois ' Dick Reynolds , Lawton Lamb , Stacey Siders and Henry Cryer , the two-mile relay in 7:31.6.
