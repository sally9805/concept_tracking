As manager of the civilian Credit Union at the Navy 's big Quonset Point Air Station near Providence , R.I. , Gerald Lynch had reason to feel a little nervous when payday came around . Part of his job was cashing paychecks for Quonset 's 4,000 civilian employees , and a year ago burglars had stolen $60,000 from the union 's safe . Payday arrived last week , and Manager Lynch called in Thomas Smith , a burly civilian guard . Together , they picked up $100,000 in small bills and change from the Navy paymaster and drove back to the Credit Union 's door . <P> A green 1950 Oldsmobile slammed to a stop beside Lynch 's car . Two men with Halloween masks over their faces hopped out , jabbed snub-nosed revolvers at them and barked : " Give us the money . We 're not kidding . " Lynch and Smith promptly handed over their guns and the moneybags . " What are you going to do when a man pokes a gun in your ribs , " asked Smith later , " be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded as if it had been written by Mack Sennett . At the main gate , three startled marine guards jumped for safety as the getaway car shot through at 60 m.p.h . They hauled out their .45s , but the pieces were empty ; the clips were in their belts ( base regulations to avoid accidents ) . The police telephoned ahead to set up a roadblock . They were seconds too late ; the green Oldsmobile got away . A few minutes later , a patrolman answered a fire alarm on a back road five miles from the base . It was the Oldsmobile , abandoned and burning . But when he tried to report it , his two-way radio would n't work ; it took him precious minutes to call off the chase for the Oldsmobile and change it to a dark coupe that had been seen speeding away from the area where the Oldsmobile was found . <P> The new description had just gone over the air when a Providence cop saw two black coupes . He took off after them in a 70-mile-an-hour chase in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , with the first police car behind them . The second police car smashed into the first , reducing both to junk . The men they were chasing turned out to be FBI agents hurrying to Quonset to investigate the robbery . <P> The holdup men seemed to have made a clean getaway in New England 's biggest holdup since the $1,500,000 Brink 's robbery in 1950.
