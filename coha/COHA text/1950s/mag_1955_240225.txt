Like the U.S. , which once advised its young men to go west , Israel also has a slogan for its young people . Exhorts a popular Israeli song : " Go south , young man . " But Israel 's south , the Negev , is no land of opportunity . Comprising half the nation 's land total , the Negev is a forbidding wasteland spotted with the rare patches of green of a few farms expensively irrigated by dedicated pioneers . Yet to determined Zionists , the Negev could provide an outlet for Israel 's rapidly growing population ( more than doubled since 1948 , to 1,700,000 ) and abundant crops-if there were abundant water . <P> Last week the Israelis sent water-the most precious commodity in the Middle East-coursing into the parched southland . Before a happy crowd of 15,000 at Rosh Haayin , ten miles from modern Tel Aviv-Jaffa , old President Itzhak Ben-Zvi thanked God and pressed a lever . With a roar giant diesel pumps began to send water from the Yarkon River into a 66-in. pipeline that snakes toward the Negev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most costly and ambitious development project yet undertaken by the bustling Israelis . Starting in 1953 , they laid 22,000 sections of concrete-lined steel pipe , each weighing ten tons , and built seven pumping stations and three large reservoirs . The U.S. sent technical aid , most of the tools , and almost all the $24,750,000 required for financing : $4,500,000 as a direct U.S. grant-in-aid , another $9,350,000 indirectly in counterpart funds , the remainder in private funds . <P> After 1958 , when a twin pipeline is completed to the eastern Negev , the whole project will increase Israel 's irrigable area by 100,000 acres , or 50% , and there will be land for 66,000 newcomers . Unfortunately , the Negev pipeline scheme is far from being the answer to Israel 's search for self-sufficiency in food . Last fiscal year , Israel 's best economically since its birth seven years ago , imports of $289,500,000 greatly exceeded exports of $881 million . The agricultural output resulting from the new Negev farms will cut the huge deficit by only $20 million , or 10% . <P> Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance into the Negev , more sober officials realized that they had gone about as far south as they could go . In committing the Yarkon they had mortgaged almost their entire available water supply . ( In fact , part of the annual 7 trillion cubic feet of water that will flow through the pipeline will be reclaimed from Tel Aviv 's sewers . ) <P> Israel 's only hope of getting enough water to irrigate the 125,000 dry acres remaining in the Negev is to find a way to end the political fight with Jordan , which has blocked use of Jordan River water .
