At a Moscow embassy party last week , First Deputy Premier Maxim Saburov boasted , " The Soviet Union will draw even with the U.S. in the foreseeable future . " <P> The Bolsheviks are talking big these days . Western specialists do not expect to live to see Russian production overtake the U.S. , but after analyzing the figures that Saburov gave out for the first time in Russia 's new , sixth Five Year Plan ( TIME , Jan. 23 ) , they are becoming increasingly respectful of Soviet economic progress . <P> Russian Steel . Judged by Saburov 's claims of last year 's performance in 50 basic industrial commodities , Russia 's planned economy is now second only to the U.S. 's booming free economy , and growing twice as fast ( having so much farther to go ) . For the first time , Russia used hard figures , not meaningless percentages . Russian steel production ( a mere 4,300,000 tons in 1928 ) was 45.2 million tons last year , and the 1960 target is 68.3 million tons . Though this falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears to surpass that of France and Germany combined . The Soviet Union plans to top U.S. coal output next year . If the Russians fulfill their goal of raising national income 60% by 1960 , they will have to be at two-thirds of the present U.S. economic strength , and will have achieved the broad base of heavy industry their world ambitions require . <P> Only in agriculture does the Soviet Union confess great weakness . The new plan that so confidently ticks off industrial goals discloses no figures for past food production , and Pravda admits that the agricultural goals were not fulfilled . But the new plan demands 100% greater productivity on collective farms by 1960 , which Western specialists think is an impossible target . " This new and dangerous stage in the attempt to assimilate Soviet agriculture , " says the London Observer 's Edward Crankshaw , " can mean nothing less than an unspoken declaration of war on the mass of the peasants . " <P> Chinese Earth . Red China 's bosses are also making tremendous claims . Writing on " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mao Tse-tung last week asserted that some 70 million farm families-more than two-thirds of all peasant households-have now been collectivized . He told a party meeting in Peking that Red China 's Socialist revolution " has rolled ahead so fast " since he ordered a speedup last summer that he now thinks it can be basically achieved for China 's 585 million in about three more years . Apparently Mao believes his great purge of 1950-51 , in which perhaps as many as 15 million died , so effectively destroyed the Chinese will to resist that he can now press on with complete collectivization of the land without having to kill more millions in a new blood bath .
