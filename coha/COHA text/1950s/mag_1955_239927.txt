" The baseball journalists of this town , sometimes called New York , have gone the way of all flash , " complained the Morning Telegraph 's Columnist Barney Nagler . He had a point . The season was less than a week old and the writers were already reporting everything in terms of records . Example : Dodger Carl Furillo hit four home runs in his first three games and a wire service touted him as " 11 games ahead of Babe Ruth 's record 1927 home-run pace . " " And so it goes , " moaned Columnist Nagler , " ad boredom . " <P> Then Brooklyn gave the writers a break . <P> Before anyone ran out of hoked-up records , the Dodgers set an early-season mark that took the boredom off every sports page . They won ten straight games , ran down the world champion Giants , breezed by the feeble Phillies , and tripped up the faltering Pittsburgh Pirates on the way . No major-league team had shown more early foot since the National League New Yorks of 1884 took twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie ) . <P> Doubtful Decisions . The Dodgers ' performance was all the more remarkable because , to hear the sports writers tell it in the preseason windjamming , the Brooklyn " Bums " were headed for nothing but trouble . All through spring training , the press sniped at Manager " Smokey " Alston with ill-mannered regularity . When Jackie Robinson had a beef about how seldom he was playing , he got columns of space in which to howl . When Catcher Roy Campanella had a complaint about his spot in the batting order ( No. 8 ) , his words were rushed into type . Dodger President Walter O'Malley wondered out loud if a squabbling ball club might not be a healthy one . Nobody seemed to be listening . <P> <P> But while they talked like bickering schoolboys , the Dodgers played like pros from the first game . Even as they finally lost one last week , they were so hot that the Giants who beat them ( 5-4 ) needed a couple of Willie Mays 's classiest catches and a couple of Umpire Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the fourth inning , with the Dodgers coasting along on a 2-0 lead , Left Fielder Sandy Amoros raced home from second on a blooping single . Monte Irvin 's peg beat him to the plate . Umpire Pinelli spread his arms , palms down . Safe ? Leo Durocher , the Giants ' manager , boiled from the bench . Unaccountably astonished because Durocher and 27,297 fans had misunderstood him , Pinelli jerked his thumb over his shoulder and allowed that Amoros was out . Durocher simmered down . Dodger Manager Alston kicked up a brief fuss just for the record . <P> Neat Squeeze . Alston 's big moment came later , in the last of the eighth . Now the Giants were ahead 5-4 . The Dodgers had men on first and third-one out . At the plate , Jackie Robinson laid down a neat bunt to squeeze Runner Don Zimmer home . But Zimmer hesitated on the base path , playing it safe . Steaming across the infield , First Baseman Whitey Lockman scooped up the ball and whipped it home . " Yer out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alston . And with half his team 's help , he played some colorful variations on the same theme . " You too , " said Pinelli , and Alston departed for the evening .
