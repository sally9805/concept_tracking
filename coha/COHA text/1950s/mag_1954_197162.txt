Two Grumman Wildcats droned over the Atlantic , 100 miles off Cap Blanc , on search mission . At almost the same moment , each pilot spotted what he was looking for : the dark , sharklike outline of a German U-boat , slipping along just under the waves . Simultaneously , the two planes flashed the warning , " Sighted sub , " back to their flattop , the Guadalcanal , known to her crew as the Can Do . As the carrier 's five destroyer escorts closed in and depth charges spumed up , the submarine jammed her diving planes into the down position . <P> That was in June 1944 , at the height of World War II . This week in Chicago , the rusting , bullet-riddled submarine , the U-505 , will be hauled to her final snug harbor at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry , as a memorial to all the U.S. seamen who lost their lives at sea in World Wars I and II , and as a personal tribute to Rear Admiral Dan Gallery , the lean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geysers . When Gallery 's sub-destroying team attacked the U-5O5 , most of the Nazi crew was eating Sunday dinner . The depth charges damaged the sub 's external ballast tanks and turned her over on her side , tossing officers and men to the decks in a tumble of crockery and dumplings . The captain ordered preparations for scuttling . Then he surfaced the U-5O5 to let the crew escape . <P> When the Nazi submariners emerged from the U-boat , they were greeted with a rataplan of small-caliber fire from encircling destroyers . Planes growled overhead , and depth charges still geysered around the stricken submarine . The Ger mans lost no time going overboard , and when Commander F. S. Hall , destroyer division commander , estimated that the entire crew had left , he ordered a ceasefire . From the Germans , bobbing in the waves , came three cheers for the sinking U-505 . From the Pillsbury 's loudspeakers came a rarely heard order : " Away boarding parties ! " <P> Whaleboats &; Logs . The diesels of the U-505 were still running , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Lieut , ( j.g . ) Albert David and eight crewmen from the destroyer Pillsbury jumped aboard , minutes after the last live German had left ( the body of one Nazi , the only fatality in the whole operation , was found aboard the U-boat ) . Racing below , the boarders shut the seacocks , stopped the engines and searched for booby traps . That evening the U-5O5 - rechristened Can Do , Jr. - rode at the end of a towline behind the Guadalcanal . <P> It was the first time since 1815 that the U.S. Navy had boarded and captured a foreign man-of-war on the high seas. * <P> Junior spent the rest of the European war in Bermuda . The capture was a top secret that the German admiralty never fathomed . The captured codebooks , logs and general orders were described by Naval intelligence officers as one of the greatest windfalls of the war . For his heroism , Lieut . David ( now dead ) got the Medal of Honor . <P>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
