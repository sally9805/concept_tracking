TIME Correspondent Frank Gibney was in Pusan last week when the first troops of the U.S. 1st Marine Division , confident and well equipped , arrived from the U.S. and moved out to the front . Later , Gibney went up to join a regiment of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division , which had been fighting steadily for 31 days . What he saw , a platoon-eye view of the war , gave a very different picture from sweeping communiques of how the Americans were doing in Korea . Gibney cabled : <P> JAMES SHELTON , a 21-year-old private from Company D , 1st Battalion , 19th Infantry Regiment , was awakened from the sleep of the exhausted by the zing of Communist bullets over his foxhole . For an hour before , confident Communist infantrymen , their conical Russian helmets sticking up like mushrooms through the early morning mist , had marched along a steep dirt road to a mountain pass commanding the U.S. positions . Wakeful U.S. sentries heard the Reds singing snatches of Communist marching songs as they pulled an aged , creaking , Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead platoon of Communists approached the pass , some overeager G.I.s opened fire , instead of waiting to trap the next unit . " I was asleep when they cut loose , " Shelton said , " then the next thing I knew , enemy bullets were coming into my hole . " But the suddenly awakened soldiers discovered that their buddies had the situation under control . Blasts from U.S. BARs and salvo after salvo from 75-mm. recoilless rifles ripped into the advancing Reds , pinning some to the clifflike wall of the pass , hurling others into the roadside ditches . Within minutes , the first wave of the Communist attack had been shattered . <P> " Mansei ! " Almost on the heels of the first wave of Reds came a U.S. counterattack . Spearheaded by five tanks and two M-8 reconnaissance cars , truckloads of G.I.s from the 19th Infantry Regiment roared through the pass and down into the valley below . Heavy Communist fire damaged the two recon cars and three tanks . The G.I.s , supported by covering fire from the pass , spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the valley and on the crests of the surrounding hills . <P> Slowly the weight of two full Red regiments pushed the undermanned U.S. units back toward the pass . But at the pass , the G.I.s stuck . Time &; time again , Red charges smashed against the Americans ' guns . As the Reds rushed up reserves , frantic G.I. gunners manning 13 guns lobbed a torrent of 155-mm. and 105-mm. shells into masses of green-clad North Koreans trying to move up along the hillsides . But the Reds kept on coming . Two " Mansei " ( the Korean equivalent of the Japanese " Banzai " ) charges rolled up against the U.S. positions-and broke . <P> The Gun They Never Served . By late afternoon the battle was almost over . A Sherman tank stood watchfully around the bend of the road at the head of the pass . On the slopes of the nearby hills , mortar crews and machine-gunners looked out over the valley , which was quiet now . Beyond the pass there was an eerie silence . All our outposts had withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field during the fighting , thanks to the heroic efforts of Army Medical Corpsmen who drove jeeploads of groaning soldiers back from the front , heedless of enemy fire .
