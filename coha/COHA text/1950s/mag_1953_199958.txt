The Augusta National Golf Course , with its carpet-smooth greens , lush fairways and pitfall traps , was in fine shape for the Masters golf tournament . So were the Masters . The day before the tournament started , Lloyd Mangrum , golf 's leading moneywinner , broke his own course record with a sensational 63 , nine strokes under par . Defending Champion Sam Snead , who took the title away from Ben Hogan , fired a fine 71 . U.S. Open Champion Julius Boros , who took that title away from Hogan in 1952 , was at the peak of his game with a 67 . <P> Almost lost in the shuffle , but never far from anyone 's mind , was Ben Hogan himself . The taciturn Texan , with eleven sub-par practice rounds under his belt , spent the final day of practice just puttering around the putting green . Admitting he was " in grand shape " ( he had not played a major tournament in ten months ) , Hogan made one prediction : the tournament scoring record-279-would be broken . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the record-breaking himself . <P> Toward the end of his first round , Ben ran into all sorts of trouble ; he was in the water on No. 15 , in bunkers on Nos. 17 and 18 . Each error cost him a stroke , yet he wound up with a sub-par 70 in a tie for third place-one stroke up on Snead , three on Boros , four on Mangrum . A second-round 69 put Hogan in the lead . <P> But it was not until the third round that Hogan really took charge . Bantam ( 139 Ibs . ) Ben , playing with chunky ( 220 Ibs . ) Ed Oliver , and often out-hitting him , drew ohs &; ahs from a crowd of some 10,000 with his fairway-splitting shots . The ahs changed to outright cheers on the ninth green when golfdom 's mechanical man , after careful sighting , crisply stroked a 60-ft. putt into the cup for an outgoing four-under-par 32 . The word that went around the Augusta gallery : <P> They 11 never catch him now . " Ben finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Augusta , " for an insurmountable four-stroke lead going into the final round . This week cool-as-ice Ben banged out his fourth straight sub-par round , a 69 to beat Runner-Up Oliver and the Masters scoring record by five strokes with a fabulous 274.
