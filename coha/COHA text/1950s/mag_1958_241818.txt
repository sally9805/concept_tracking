U.S. radio and TV networks have fought boldly for the right to editorialize - and timidly let it go virtually unused . Last week , for the second time in network history , * CBS exercised its right . In an editorial prepared by the network 's little-known editorial board-headed by Chairman William S. Paley and President Frank Stanton-Washington Newsman Howard K. Smith charged that Americans are " overcomplacent , overaddicted to comfort , and indifferent to good government . " He urged changes in the Pentagon to eliminate interservice chauvinism , called for readiness to negotiate for disarmament , warned : " We must be prepared to make sacrifices , to pay higher taxes , to face controls if necessary to achieve our goals . " <P> Punches . The editorial , which the network had sent out in advance to about 160 affiliates , came as the climax of Where We Stand , a special 90-minute report comparing U.S. and Soviet strength . The show was the idea of President Stanton , and its content took added weight from his role as one of the shapers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance sheet " that Stanton ordered , the network news staff labored for three months over documents , interviews and film . <P> The result was impressive . On-screen popped perhaps too many models of globes and satellites , a blinding melange of maps , diagrams and statistics that have already been hammered out by the press . But there were thrilling shots of an Atlas test failure , of the Titan ( " the most sophisticated long-range missile " ) resting ominously on its pad . And CBS gave viewers the kind of peek inside bustling missile plants that newspapers do not provide . In matter-of-fact interviews , U.S. scientists and generals pulled no punches . Warned Air Force Missileman General Bernard Schriever : " It 's safe to say the Russians have IRBMs now in operational units . We do not . " <P> Intangibles . As accumulated by CBS , the balance sheet seemed to show that in the material things and the means of making them the U.S. still leads the Soviet Union ; in actual strength it may be lagging , and in the crucial intangibles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . <P> Although viewers learned that civil defense is virtually nonexistent in Russia , the U.S. lag came into dramatic focus when a woman in Morris Plains , N.J. was asked what she would do in a nuclear attack . Said she : " Put all the food out on the porch " - " The last place , " noted Smith , " to put food when there 's danger of radiation . " And Chief Reporter Alex Kendrick indicted in pictures the nation 's educational deficiencies when he visited Alhambra ( Calif . ) High School and found students taking a snap course called " coed-cooking . " Asked Kendrick of one coed-cook , a boy who hoped to become an engineer : " How are you going to apply this to a career as a scientist ? " Said the would-be American technician of the Space Age : " Say in three years or so , I will be out on my own and I will want to cook something on my own . I mean , I will know how to cook it . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stuff . " <P> <P> * The first : CBS 's 1954 plea for TV 's right of access to public hearings .
