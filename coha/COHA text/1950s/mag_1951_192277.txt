" There are my brushes , " jokes Belgian Painter Constant Permeke , 64 , pointing to the brooms in the corner of his studio . At first glance , Permeke 's lowering land and seascapes , bulky peasants and heavy-limbed nudes look as though they might well have been swept on to the canvas with a carelessly bound bunch of straw . But their spontaneity and crudely powerful draftsmanship have earned him a place as a leader of Belgian expressionism and , according to some critics , " one of the most incontestable masters that Belgium has given to art .

There , with a few other young experimenters , he set about fighting the impressionist artists-in-residence . For their softly lighted diffused studies Permeke substituted virile paintings of grubby , stocky farmers with huge limbs and bullnecks , stuck them in earthy , gloomy landscapes . <P> By the 1920s , Permeke had bludgeoned his way into the art consciousness of even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already so large that he was able to collect 550 paintings for a Brussels exhibition . He boasted that in many of his pictures there was not a single bit of retouching ; some of the vast land-and seascapes were the work of an afternoon . At 50 , he decided that painting was not enough to consume his prodigious energy , and began doing big , sprawling sculptures of his sturdy models . <P> Last week Permeke was still going at his art with the same bulldozer determination . At Antwerp , he closed his second big show of painting and sculpture in less than six months and hustled back to work .
