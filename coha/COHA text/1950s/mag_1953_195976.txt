Two prominent Washington bachelors were vacationing at the Del Charro Hotel in La Jolla , Calif , last week , and a local reporter asked one of them to give his opinion of the other . Said FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in one of his extremely rare personal endorsements : " Senator Joe McCarthy is an exmarine . He was an amateur boxer . He 's Irish . Combine those , and you 're going to have a vigorous individual who is not going to be pushed around . . . <P> " I 've come to know Senator McCarthy well , officially and personally . I view him as a friend and I believe he so views me . Certainly , he is a controversial man . He is earnest and he is honest . He has enemies . Whenever you attack subversives of any kind , Communists , Fascists , even the Ku Klux Klan , you are going to be the victim of the most extremely vicious criticism that can be made . I know . But sometimes a knock is a boost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll know I 'm slipping . " <P> Then Hoover had a cautious afterthought . " I am not passing on the technique of McCarthy 's committee , " he said , " or other Senate committees . That 's the Senators ' responsibility . But the investigative committees do a valuable job . . . " <P> At his press conference last week , Attorney General Brownell , Hoover 's boss , told reporters that the formal investigation of McCarthy 's financial conduct was continuing-presumably under the guidance of J. Edgar Hoover 's FBI . Then a reporter asked him a question that fouled Brownell in his own syntax : " Do you think it appropriate for a member of the Justice Department to make a statement evaluating the character of a person whose affairs are under study in the department ? " <P> " Oh , " said Brownell , after some hesitation . " If you mean Mr. Hoover , I have not read his statement . . . But the important thing here-I have such full confidence and admiration for J. Edgar Hoover-I would like to stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
