A Portland attorney named Richard H. Broderick was one of six Portland Democrats running for a seat in the Maine house of representatives . Lawyer Broderick , well aware that his party had not elected a representative to the legislature from Portland since Depression 1934 , made no speeches , decided shortly after the campaign began to accept a good job in Los Angeles , packed up and headed West . Last week Broderick got a long-distance telephone call . The gist : come home ; you 've won . <P> Broderick was one of many : in the nation 's first 1956 general election* the reign in Maine fell plainly on the Democrats . Democratic Governor Edmund Sixtus Muskie , 42 , running for a second term against Willis A. Trafton Jr. , 37 , speaker of the state house of representatives , had been conceded an edge , but he was highly surprised by his 179,697-to-123,784 victory . Lewiston Lawyer and Democratic State Chairman Frank M. Coffin fared even more spectacularly by winning , for the first time in 22 years , the Democratic congressional seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James C. Oliver lost his fight for Congressman from the industrial First District ( Portland ) to five-term Representative Robert Hale by only 28 votes , and may apply for a recount . Democrats won 63 seats in the 184-member state legislature- an increase of 23 , six of them in Portland alone-to knock out the Republicans ' two-thirds veto power in the house . <P> " One Good Term . . . " How did it happen ? For one thing , as Dwight Eisenhower said later , " Maine had a very popular governor . " Genial Ed Muskie , son of a Polish immigrant , had turned in a successful administration , programmed improvements in social welfare , education , development of natural resources , asked for a minimum wage law , a new department of industry and commerce , and proposed a bond issue to maintain the pace of highway construction . What further fired Maine 's independent-minded voters was Muskie 's straightforward eggheadedness ( Bates ' 36 , Phi Beta Kappa ) , his ability to discuss convincingly ethical and moral questions . In his campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spread his gospel-tagged with a surefire slogan : " One good term deserves another . " <P> But Muskie 's popularity was only part of the story . The figures told the rest : the voting strength of both parties was up , but the Democrats were up more . Republican Trafton , for example , polled 10,486 votes more than 1954 's G.O.P. candidate ; Muskie pulled in 44,024 more votes than he had gotten in 1954 . In the First District , Republican Congressman Hale got 10,700 votes more than in 1954 ; Democrat Oliver got an additional 14,418 . In the newly Democratic Second District , the Republican earned an extra 2,531 votes over 1954 , the Democrat an extra 16,350 . Only in the predominantly rural Third District did the increase favor a Republican ( 4,527 v. 2,580 ) .
