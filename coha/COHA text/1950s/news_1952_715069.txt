Charles K. Gilbert . retired Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of New York . The group has been incorporated as the City Affairs Committee , a name made famous by civic leaders who banded together in the latter years of Mayor James J. Walker 's Administration to fight graft and inefficiency and later played a large part in bringing about the election of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia . The original committee disbanded during the La Guardia reform administration . Several of the leaders of the earlier City Affairs Committee ? among them John Haynes Holmes , Norman Thomas and Frederick L. Guggenheimer  --  are among the 150 sponsoring members of the new group .

A. remark by Mr. Windels that the city government seemed to have swung a twenty-year cycle led a questioner to ask if that meant that he was comparing Mayor Impellitteri 's Administration to " the Jimmy Walker era . " , " I would n't say anything per-1 sonally disparaging about Mayor Impellitteri , " replied Mr. Windels , 1 who had been Mayor La Guardia 's , corporation counsel .

If Mr. Impellitteri had the will to get away from his political background , he could have put a stop to some bad conditions .

The committee has been in process of organizing for nearly a year , said Bishop Gilbert . He said investigators had been studying city problems since last spring and had analyzed the reports of the Mayor 's Executive Committee on Management . He criticized conditions in the Department of Hospitals where , he said , " workers totally unqualified are permitted to bottle liquid medications such as tincture of belladonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap , while in the same department licensed pharmacists are spending most of their time on employmen4 , administration and purchasing aria budgeting . " In the Department of Welfare , he said , fifteen trained pharmacists spent their time pricing eacti item on prescriptions for which payment was claimed " whether the charge is 5 cents or $5 . " He said the entire pricing procedure saved less than $50,000 while the salariee of the pharmacists so engaged totaled $46,000 without allowance foe related overhead . Bishop Gilbert said the commit , tee would issue period reports , send representatives to City Hall hearings and other forums and seek to stir up public interest in city problems .
