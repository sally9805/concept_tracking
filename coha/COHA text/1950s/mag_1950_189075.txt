( See Cover ) <P> If it were possible to cap the human ego like a gas well , and to pipe off its more volatile byproducts as fuel , Houston 's multi-millionaire wildcatter Glenn McCarthy could heat a city the size of Omaha with no help at all . Whether he would allow his rampant psyche to be dedicated completely to so prosaic a project , however , is doubtful-several million cubic feet would undoubtedly be diverted to a McCarthy Memorial Beacon which would nightly cast its glare as far west as El Paso . <P> As it is , the works and pomps which Glenn McCarthy has raised in honor of McCarthy have taken a more solid form . There is McCarthy 's Houston mansion , a white-pillared , $700,000 pile surrounded by vast lawns and trees bearded with Spanish moss . There is the 15,000-acre ranch on which he admires his blooded cattle and occasionally shoots deer , goats and turkeys . There is McCarthy 's Colosadium ( so far , only on paper ) , a 110,000-seat stadium for Houston with a sliding roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which include a four-engined Boeing Stratoliner . <P> <P> Most imposing of all is McCarthy 's showy and opulent new Shamrock Hotel . In causing its white , glass-tiered , palm-bordered bulk to rise above the Texas coastal plain , McCarthy endowed Houston with the Southwest 's most luxurious hostelry-a soft-carpeted , $21 million palace which boasts French cooking ( filet mignon : $11 ) , air-conditioned bedrooms with both push-button radio and Muzak , afternoon tea served to string music and big-name dinner entertainers like Edgar Bergen and Dorothy Lamour . <P> Wearing of the Green . In its purest sense the Shamrock is less a hotel than a kind of Versailles , and it is almost impossible to enter without being reminded that its Louis is none other than Glenn McCarthy . A large oil portrait of the proprietor hangs on a wall flanking the lobby elevator doors ; framed there , with folded arms , tumbled hair and an expression reminiscent of both Maxie Rosenbloom and Barrymore 's Hamlet , he stares austerely at all who enter . The portrait 's eyes are said to soften slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's iron will and lordly tastes are reflected by other aspects of the hotel . There is the color scheme , for instance , which boasts 63 different shades of green and encompasses walls , rugs , the bellhops ' emerald &; lemon uniforms and the grass-hued ink with which guests sign the register . McCarthy makes all public announcements concerning the hotel ( George Lindholm , whom he hired away from Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria as manager , resigned quietly last week ) . <P> The Acquisitive Eye . In an age when most businessmen allow themselves to be governed by politicians , unions , directors , psychiatrists , the threat of ulcers and the precepts of Emily Post , McCarthy holds himself accountable only to McCarthy . Both in his bull-like determination to make himself Houston 's first citizen and in the conduct of his business empire-which includes vast oil holdings , Houston 's radio station KXYZ , a chemical works , 14 neighborhood newspapers and a swank men 's shop-he often seems a throwback to the lustier days of the 19th Century .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
