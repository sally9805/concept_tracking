Cline R. Paden of Lubbock , Texas went to Italy eight years ago to establish a beachhead for his Church of Christ . He found the way of the missionary hard . First there was the matter of the license , required for any enterprise in Italy , from a church to a cigar stand . Paden could not have a license because he had entered Italy as a tourist , and his application for a permanent residence permit would have to wait . Tourist Paden lost patience and put up a sign on his building in the Via Achille Papa , in the shadow of the Vatican . The sign , in letters ten inches high , read CHIESA DI CHRISTI ( Church of Christ ) . <P> Promptly , the police arrested Cline Paden for unlicensed activity . But sentence was delayed . Paden put up the sign again . The police tore it down . He sued the police . The judge exonerated the police , saying that they had acted in good faith , whether or not Paden 's sign was legal . Paden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . In another similar case Italy 's highest court formally upheld the principle of religious toleration . Last week Paden put the sign up again . <P> Up roared the police , down came the sign . Paden started tacking it up again . Back came the police , down came the sign . Paden 's brother Gerald had locked himself in a car to take pictures of the incident , but the police broke into the car and took him off to jail . They also arrested Signora Disma Pollipoli , wife of an Italian Church of Christ preacher . At week 's end , Missionary Paden nailed his sign outside an upstairs window and locked the front door . Said he : " The police came , and they put up their ladders , but they could n't reach the sign . They beat on the door , but we did not open it ... So they left , and this is proof of our legal right and of God 's protection . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
