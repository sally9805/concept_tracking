Flying to San Francisco to deliver the Republican Convention 's keynote speech this week , Washington 's Governor Arthur B. Langlie confided to a friend that he had watched the pyrotechnics of Democratic Keynoter Frank Clement , found them distasteful . Said Langlie : " I 'll be passing up the Chicago brand of prejudicial fire and brimstone in favor of what I 've tried to make a higher tone . " To his wife Evelyn he fretted : " I want to be sure that nobody can say this speech has any unjustified name-calling . " <P> When balding , blue-eyed Arthur Langlie took the Cow Palace platform , there was virtually no name-calling at all . But in Langlie 's G.O.P. eyes , a sharp indictment of the Democratic Party was justified : " They left us a staggering national debt , a greatly reduced value of the dollar , a colossal bureaucracy and vastly increased taxes . . . The Democratic party was responsible for the security of our country and of the free world precisely when Communist world aggression achieved its maximum success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when , on another continent , China became part of the Communist empire . " <P> Langlie , no flaming orator , had an oratorical flourish or two to rival a Clement . The Democrats , he said , have a heritage of " colossal mismanagement and corruption . . . For 20 years they subsisted only from one crisis to another-some real , some imaginary , some fabricated . " <P> But Art Langlie had come to San Francisco not so much for the fun of a counterattack as for a positive statement of achievements . Quickly he ticked off major areas in which the Administration had kept its promises : <P> Foreign Policy . " We have done more than just talk about peace ; we have worked for it . We have seen Communist aggression come to a complete halt . We have seen a halt in the world 's drift toward nuclear war . . . We have seen dangers in their most awful forms lessen rather than grow . . . challenges met instead of evaded . We have seen , in great part as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world Communism forced to renounce some of their old ways . " <P> Agriculture . " When this Republican administration took office the bottom was falling out of farm prices . Under the new Republican laws in the first six months of 1956 average farm prices steadied and then went up . They are still going up ... The farmer today can once again look forward to raising his crops for his markets instead of Government warehouses . " <P> Employment . " Our policies have sustained over 66 million peacetime jobs for American men and women at the highest wages in our history . " <P> Civil Rights . " Through every agency in Government , except Congress , we have witnessed the greatest gains for civil rights over a period of 80 years . We have not given mere lip service . We have acted . " <P> The Economy . " We have checked the runaway inflation we inherited from the previous Administration . We have reduced taxes by seven and a half billion dollars a year .
