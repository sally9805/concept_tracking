Technical progress and fashion fads can lead to baldness in both men and women , reports London 's erudite medical journal , the Lancet . One sure cause is a certain type of nylon hairbrush , and it took keen detective work by London Dermatologist Agnes Savill to find this out . A man of 27 went to her with a triangular bald spot , getting persistently bigger , on the side of his head . Dr. Savill found many short hairs of unequal length , some with frayed ends . Her conventional treatments-oil and massage-did no good , but when the patient switched to an old-fashioned boar-bristle brush , his hair grew out normally . Dr. Savill compared this with similar cases , found that the common villain was a nylon brush with bristles cut off square at the ends . Her most extreme case : a woman of 28 who was on the verge of suicide last year because of hair loss , was saved by a bristle brush . Nylon brushes with rounded bristle ends appear to do no harm . <P> As for fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equine folly wear their hair in ' pony tails , ' which tends to drag out the hair at the temples . This form of baldness is endemic in Greenland . . . Loss of hair is seen in American Negro women who paradoxically want to make their hair straight .
