From the far corners of the globe this week the elite of the Marxist world converged on Moscow for the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R. Red China 's Chou En-lai arrived by plane , leaving Mao and the rest of the Chinese leadership behind , obviously preoccupied . In Chou 's wake moved lesser lights , ranging from East Germany 's Walter Ulbricht down to James Jackson , the U.S. Communist Party 's secretary for Southern and Negro affairs . <P> Mirrored in the watchful faces of the gathering Communist clan was the realization that the 21st Party Congress could well prove as momentous as the 20th Congress three years ago . at which Khrushchev tearfully and historically denounced Stalin . For weeks past , ominous hints have been gathering that Khrushchev might use the occasion to deal a final blow to his disgraced foes - the " antiparty group " composed of Malenkov , Bulganin . Molotov , Shepilov and Kaganovich . In the usual Communist technique , a crime has to be found to match the punishment , and Khrushchev may well blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antiparty men , thus satisfying two desires at once . But the rest of the world was likely to center its interest in the Congress on the report that brash , quick-witted Anastas Mikoyan had brought back from his U.S. " vacation . " <P> In a two-hour , U.S.-style press conference within the ancient Kremlin* walls , Mikoyan reported to the Soviet press on his trip . In high good humor , he told of visiting the dacha of Cleveland Industrialist Cyrus Eaton , and of a luncheon at which he had pressed " my old friend " former Governor Averell Harriman to revisit Moscow now that Nelson Rockefeller had freed him to travel . Mikoyan paid tribute to American women - " they were very nice to us ; they can not hide their feelings as well as a man " - and recalled with evident relish his luncheon with those archvillains of Communist mythology , the bankers of Wall Street . <P> From the Soviet point of view , it was a disturbing fact that Mikoyan 's trip had made no visible dent in the unity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare vote of confidence in U.S. diplomatic skill , admiringly agreed that Washington had handled Mikoyan adroitly . In West Germany the U.S. had accomplished the diplomatic equivalent of the hat trick . While rock-hard Chancellor Konrad Adenauer rejoiced in his belief that the U.S. had " held firm " against Mikoyan 's blandishments , the opposition Social Democratic Party was happily convinced that the U.S. had displayed " new flexibility . " Combat of Paris reflected a common European sentiment : " Mikoyan interested , aroused and amused America but did not capture it . "
