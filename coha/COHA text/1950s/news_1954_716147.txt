txt The Democratic proposal for higher personal income tax exemptions was rejected by the House of Representatives today , 210 to 204 , in a dramatic if close victory for President Eisenhower . The House then immediately passed , 339 to 80 , the Administration 's omnibus tax reform bill providing $1,397,000,000 of relief for most businesses and many individuals in the first year of operation and perhaps twice that amount by 1956 . In addition to a complete overhaul of the basic tax structure , the measure calls for cancellation of an automatic reduction in corporation rates scheduled for April 1 . It now goes to the Senate , where Democrats plan to renew the fight for a general reduction in individual income taxes by higher personal exemptions , now $600 each for taxpayers and dependents . Long Hearing Planned A decision is not likely to be reached there for some time , however , as the Finance Committee probably will- hold at least six weeks of hearings on the reform bill , It is mow working on a companion bill , passed by the House last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items and extend present rates on others . The House ballot on the Democratic proposal came after two days of tense debate and much shifting of positions in the ranks of both parties . The outcome was generally regarded as a significant personal victory for President Eisenhower in view of the fact that his legislative leaders had repeatedly made the point that a vote for the Democratic proposal would be " a vote against Ike . " In addition , the President had taken the issue to the nation by television and radio on Monday night , representing the Administration 's tax proposals as the " cornerstone " of his whole legislative program . The showdown came on a Democratic motion to strike from the omnibus bill a provision for special tax credits on the dividend income of corporation stockholders and substitute a $100 increase in personal exemptions for everyone . The dividend provision , if written into law , would cost the Treasury an estimated $240,000 , - 000 in revenues the first year and $850,000,000 annually by 1956 . A. $100 increase in exemptions would cost $2,400,000,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almost $3,000,000,000 , the President and Administration spokesmen contended that higher personal exemptions would throw the Government hopelessly into the red and perhaps start a new round of inflation . Some Democrats heeded that // argument as --  wrdl , " support Ike " pleas directed by Republican leaders to members of both parties . Democrats ' . thus PrOvidedOe necessary margin for Republican victory . On the crucial-bztllot , ten ' Republicansand the ' - lone House independent , Representative Frazier Reams of Ohio , joined 193 Democrats in supporting the proposed increase in personal exemptions . Voting against the motion were 201 Republicans and nine Democrats . Four of the nine Democratic opponents were from Texas , home istate of the House Minority Leader , Representative Sam Rayburn . Two other Texans were " paired " against their party 's leadeship , meaning they abstained from voting as an accommodation to absent colleagues on the other side of the issue . On passage of the bill , 208 Republicans and 131 Democrats voted " aye , " while seventy-four Republicans , five Democrats and Mr. Reams voted " no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer than had been anticipated as late as last night . An important factor in the last-minute shift was the decision by some Democrats , notably six of the seven-member Virginia delegation , to vote for the Democratic motion despite their opposition to any tax cuts at all . Their explanation was that higher personal exemptions would be a lesser evil than the special tax cut on dividend income . Regardless of the outcome , they would then vote against the bill itself . Even though the Administration apparently could not have won without Democratic help , Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts , top Republican leader of the House , issued a statement declaring that the vote showed President Eisenhower would have to rely on Republicans " in the main " for the success of his legislative program . George M. Humphrey , Secretary of the Treasury , wired his congratulations to Representatives Martin , Charles A. Halleck of Indiana , the Majority Floor Leader , and Daniel A. Reed of upstate New York , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee . He commended them for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Ways and Wars Committee and the Administration have worked so hard to develop over the past year . " Action Called ' Fortunate ' The House action , he said , was " fortunate for the country " and would serve " the long-run inter : ests of the nation . " The bill , he added , is " the cornerstone of the Administration 's program to make America a better country for us all to live- in . " . A high point of acrimony was reached shortly before the voting when Representative . Rayburn said the reform bill had been drafted " to pay campaign pledges " that had been made to contributors to the Republican party . Representative Reed , his face red and shaking his fist , jumped up and shouted : " I challenge that remark . It 's not true . " Republicans applauded . Mr. Rayburn responded that he wits not accusing anyone of " moral turpitude " but added : " Some people in the Republican party made campaign pledges which they are trying to carry out in this bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Floor Leader , predicted that today 's voting would be " a prominent issue " in the Congressional elections next November . " The Republican tax bill , " he asserted , " is indefensible in that portion which gives great benefits to corporations and constitutes a bonanza to stockholders , the larger ones in particular . It is unjust and in my opinion morally wrong to make a person with earned income pay considerably more taxes than persons with unearned income from dividends . " The disputed provision on dividend income is designed to ease the " double taxation " of corporation earnings , which are subject first to corporation income taxes and again , when distributed as dividends , in individual income taxes . Stockholders would be permitted to exclude $50 of their dividends from 1954 taxable income and $100 in subsequent years . In addition , shareholders would get an outright tax reduction equivalent to 5 per cent of any dividend income received after next July 31 . The 5 per cent credit would rise to 10 per cent on dividends received after July 31 of next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other businesses faster tax writeoffs on outlays for plant expansion and modernization , comprise the heart of the Administration 's bill . They are aimed at stimulating business , investment , . production and payrolls as part of a longrange expansion of the country 's economy . The bill also would permit retired persons over 65 to exclude up to $1,200 of their income from taxes . The benefit would be limited to a tax reduction of $240 for any one person . Income from foreign operations by United States concerns would be subject to a maximum tax of 38 per cent instead of the 52 per cent rate that applies to corporations generally . Outlays for medical expenses would be deductible from taxable income to the extent that they exceeded 3 per cent of the taxpayer 's income . These expenses may now be deducted only they exceed 5 per cent of income . In addition , maximum medical deductions would be raided from $1,250 to $2,500 for each personal exemption , with the over-all limits increased from $2,500 to $5,000 per return for single persons , $5,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of families . Full income-splitting tax privileges would be extended to single , widowed and legally separated taxpayers who support families . They now get only half of such benefits , available in full to married couples . 3* Charity Deduction Limit Deductions of $600 a year would be allowed for child care expenses of working widowers with dependent children under 10 years of age . The limit on deductions for itemized charitable contributions , now to 20 per cent of income , would ' be raised to 30 per cent . The March 15 deadline for ing final individual income tax returns would be changed to April 15 , starting next year . Corporations with annual tax liabilities of more than $50,000 , however , would have to start paying their taxes next year in September and December instead of wating until March . Taxation of income from annuities ' would be eased ' by providing for annual exclusions of amounts equal to the annuity 's cost divided ' by the taxpayer 's actuarial life expectancy at the time he started receivingppayments . At present , an annuitant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost and the remainder received each year is exempt until he has recovered tie total cot . Then , the entire amount received is subject to taxation . Business losses could be spread over an eight-year period for purposes of deducting them from profits in paying taxes . There is now a seven-year limit . Scores of ; ? .. other provisions , some easing taxes on- business , pensions , trusts , and . estates and others closing loopholes , are included in the bill . In general , the measure would be effective as of last Jan. 1 .
