txt If we were to sum up in one sentence our reaction to the declaration on the economic policies of the Eisenhower Administration just issued by the Advisory Council of the Democratic National Committee , then we would have to put it this way : " Rarely , if ever , has any presumably responsible group issued a formal statement of comparable length containing so many accusations ranging from the unsubstantiated and unprovable through the dubious to the untrue and the 4c1 i c u - lous . " The council places itself in a thoroughly untenable position before it has completed its first Short paragraph . For it starts out with these two unbelievable generalizations : ( 1 ) " Today * * * our fiscal affairs are approaching a crisis , " and ( 2 ) " the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer . " , That paragraph , regrettably , sets the tone for most of what is to follow .. From that point the council goes on to declare , without offering the slightest shadow of proof , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for large increases in prices " and that these increases , in prices " are reflected in a steadily increasing cost of living , which has reached new all-time highs in each of the last five months . " There are quite a number of other accusations , but since all of them are cut from the same bolt of cloth we . shall confine ourselves to commenting briefly on the foregoing typically irresponsible allegations . To begin with , what does the council mean when it says the Country is approaching a " fiscal crisis " ? Does the fact that there are differences of opinion as to whether the budget is too large , not too large , or not large enough ? differences that will be found among individuals of both parties  --  indicate something " critically " wrong with the present situation ? And ? would the nation 's finances be strengthened by unbalancing the budget and returning to a policy of cheap money and tax relief for favored groups , which seems to be what the council is backhandedly proposing as an alternative if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the proposed Federal budget for the coming year is a very large budget , it rests on the largest and most productive economy in the nation 's history . For two years , moreover , we have balanced our Federal expenditures by receipts with something to spare , and we are now apparently headed toward a third successive balanced budget . That is as many times as the budget was balanced in the entire preceding twentq-five years . Moreover , it was accomplished under an Administration that gave the nation , two years back , the ' biggest tax reduction in history . Has big business been using " small wage increases " as an excuse to exploit the public through higher prices ? Why does n't - the council tell us just what has happened to wages under the Eisenhower Ad. ministration ? Why does n't it give the public the figures that are easily available , that show hourly earnings in manufacturing up from $1.67 in 1952 to $2.05 at the present time ? Or average weekly earnings that have risen from $67.97 in 1952 to $82 today  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roughly 21 per cent ? As to the nonsensical observation that " the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer , " , the fact is that 69.8 per cent of the national income in 1956 went to wage and salary earners , and only 9.8 per cent to those who derive their income from interest , rent and dividends . The statement that the cost of living has Preached new highs now each month for five months " is merely an up-dated version of that popular statistical hoax as it was employed in the election campaign last year . Obviously , once the cost of living figure reached a new postwar high a few months ago , any further increases meant another new high . But who is responsible for the fact that living costs reached their present plateau ? Consumer prices have risen , since 1946 , all told , from roughly 78 . to almost 119 , or 41 points . But 37 of those points were accounted for before Mr. Eisenhower came to office , only four since the end of 1952 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cost of living is neither more nor less than an attempt to confuse the fact that while the costs of . living rose 47.5 per cent under Mr. Truman in the seven years 1946-1952 , their rise during the nearly four and a half years of Mr. Eisenhower 's Administration has been 31 , per Cent .
