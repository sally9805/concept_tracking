When war breaks out . so goes the Wall Street maxim , stocks go down and commodities go up . Last week the maxim once more proved true . The news from Egypt set off the widest break in the New York Stock Exchange since the President 's ileitis attack of June 8 . Led by Royal Dutch-Shell . Gulf Oil and other oil companies with large Mideast holdings , the Dow-Jones industrial average dropped 6.62 to 479.85 . But when the President pledged " no involvement . " the market bounced up again . At week 's end the market had more than regained its losses . <P> When the news of Anglo-French military action hit Chicago 's mammoth Board of Trade , a flood of orders overwhelmed the grain pits , turned them into a bedlam as traders bawled bids and offers . Wheat , corn . rye . cotton , soybeans , lard-just about everything except onions-soared on the prospects of war shortages , sent the Dow-Jones Commodity Futures Index up 1.66 points to 165.79 for the largest one-day advance in 2 months . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for action ; there was an expectation that even if the Mideast trouble should be settled , large shipments of commodities would be sent into the area by the U.S. The Government had already scheduled a vast surplus-grain program for India , was negotiating a wheat agreement with Israel and talking of shipping food-mostly wheat-to Poland . Hungary , and other rebellious Russian satellites . To transport the vast amount of commodities the Maritime Administration last week released thirty 10,000-ton wartime freighters from its reserve fleet . <P> <P> But the concern over oil remained . The Middle East had been shipping 2,000,000 bbls. daily to Western Europe , 1,200,000 by tanker through the Suez Canal , the other 800,000 bbls. via pipeline from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean , where tankers picked it up . Another 300,000 bbls. daily had been going from the Mideast to the U.S. <P> Tanker Shortage . If the canal and the pipelines should close down , the West would have to find new sources of oil and tankers to move it . The Western Hemi sphere could step up production an estimated 1,300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs and more than half of West ern Europe 's . But tankers are in the shortest supply ever . Sending them around the Cape of Good Hope instead of through the canal would lengthen the Persian Gulf-Rotterdam round trip from 44 to 71 days . Experts estimated that the Suez closing would require the addition of at least 144 tankers just to handle the substitute oil shipments from the Western Hemisphere . The U.S. has 34 in reserve . Last week the U.S. took six of the T25 out of mothballs , put them on sale , ordered another seven made ready . Whatever the U.S. diplomatic position toward anglo-French aggression , the U.S. Maritime Administration was going ahead with plans to release tankers for an oil lift to Western Europe .
