Free-traders won a victory last week that brought happy news to Japanese makers of stainless-steel flatware ( TIME , March 3 ) . Though the Japanese captured a big chunk of the U.S. market last year , President Eisenhower rejected a Tariff Commission recommendation for sharp duty boosts that would have raised prices of the Japanese ware in the U.S. by an average 35% , might have kept it out entirely . Instead , the President accepted Japan 's promise to hold exports to the U.S. this year to the 1956 level of 5.9 million dozen pieces ( v. 7.5 million dozen in 1957 ) . But he warned that he will ask the commission to report on the Japanese performance at the end of the year . <P> From a big Los Angeles maker of ceramic dinnerware , also confronted by rising Japanese imports that took over a big piece of the U.S. market in 1957. came a refreshing tactic last week . Instead of protesting to the Tariff Commission . Gladding , McBean &; Co. ( annual sales : $35 million ) made a deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become sole U.S. distributors of their products . Gladding . McBean will market the Japanese dishes at prices slightly below its own products .
