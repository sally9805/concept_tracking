To many modern educators , tolerance is a virtue ; to Sidney Smith , president of the University of Toronto ( enrollment : 10,852 ) and one of Canada 's top educators , it can also be an evil . Last week , speaking at Windsor , Ont. ' s Roman Catholic Assumption University , Protestant Smith told why : by trying too hard to promote tolerance in religion , modern campuses are actually promoting " religious illiteracy . " <P> " I believe , " said Smith , " that we have gone too far along the road of secularizing institutions of higher learning . There is a gap in liberal education ; it has been caused by the policy , which is all too prevalent in universities throughout the English-speaking world , of evading , ignoring , or even opposing the teaching of religion . . . This lacuna in liberal education is both lamentable and inexcusable . . . To the student who knows nothing of theology , much history is meaningless , much philosophy is distorted , and much literature is unintelligible . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tolerate different points of view . But " the tolerance of religious differences is not the same thing as ignoring religion altogether . One can be tolerant in a positive way , through sympathy and understanding , or one can be tolerant in a negative way , through apathy and moral cowardice . This negative kind of tolerance begets indifference , and indifference is at the root of religious illiteracy . "
