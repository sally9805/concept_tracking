To automen enjoying their first spring buying surge in four years , the new sales figures last week were eye openers . During May , dealers sold 529,800 U.S.-built cars , 34% more than a year earlier and the highest total for any month in two years . <P> After lagging behind Ford in April , Chevrolet moved up to first place in May , with sales estimated at 153,000 against 135,300 for Ford . Plymouth moved up to third place ( 42,500 cars ) , ahead of Pontiac ( 35,300 ) , which still kept a commanding lead over the middle-price field . In the luxury field , Cadillac reported a five-month total of 65,413-the best January-May in the company 's 57-year history . American Motors expected to turn out its 300,000th Rambler one day this week , far in excess of its total production in any previous model year . <P> Chrysler Corp . reported total May sales of 70,814 , up 19% over last year . To add more zip to sales , Chrysler 's President Lester Lum Colbert made some drastic dealer shifts-and readied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that its dual system of De Soto-Plymouth and Dodge-Plymouth dealerships , has seriously hurt Plymouth sales , since the dealers were inclined to push the higher-priced cars on which they made more money . To correct this , the De Soto and Plymouth divisions were merged , with Plymouth to be top dog . Chrysler last week asked the Dodge-Plymouth dealers to give up their Plymouth franchises , concentrate on selling Dodges , Simcas , and the new car , the Dart . Chrysler will introduce the Dart this fall , with the same chassis and engine as the Plymouth but with a different exterior . It will be priced to compete with Plymouth , Ford and Chevy.
