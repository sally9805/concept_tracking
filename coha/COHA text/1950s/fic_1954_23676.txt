Maiden in a Tower A Story by Wallace Stegner Drawings by Bern , arda Bryson . T HE highway entering Salt Lake City from the west curves around the south- ern end of Great Salt Lake past Black Rock and its ratty beaches , swings north away from the spouting smoke of the smelter towns , veers toward thc onion-shaped domes of the Saltair Pavilion , and straightens out eastward again on the speedway . Ahead , across the white flats , the city and its mountains are a mirage , or a mural : metropolitan towers , then houses and trees and channeled streets , and then the mountain wall . Driving into that , Kimball Harris began to feel like the newsreel diver whom the reversed projector sucks feet first out of his splash . Perhaps fatigue from the hard day and a ' half across the desert explained both the mirage-like look of the city and his own . sense that he was being run backward toward the beginning of the reel . But the feeling grew as he bored . townward along the straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-school boy , he had driven ? rnuch too fast in a stripped-down Ford bug with screaming companions in the rumble seat . They must have driven back , too , but he remembered only the going out . To see the city head-on , like this , was strange to him . Middle-aged , rather tired , but alert with the odd notion that he was returning both through distance and through time , lie passed the . airport and the fair grounds and slowed for the first streets of the city . Twenty-five years had made little difference . The city had spread some , and he was surprised , after the desert , by the green luxuriance of the trees , but the streets were still a half-mile wide , and water still ran in the gutters . It was really a good town , clean , with a freshness about it that revived him . Circling the Brigham Young monument , he nodded gravely to the figure with the outstretched hand , and like a native returning he went through the light and turned around the button in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Utah Hotel , careful to park well out from the curb so as not to block the flowing gutter . They gave you a ticket for that . It tickled him that he had remembered . The doorman collared his hag , a bellhop climbed in to take the car around to the garage . Still running pleasantly backward into the reel , he went into the unchanged lobby and registered , and was carried up the unchanged elevators to the kind of room he remembered , such a room as they used to take when they held fraternity parties in the hotel , back in Prohibition times . During those years he had been on a diet for ulcers , and could n't drink , but he had retired religiously with the boys , gargled raw Green River redeye , and spit it out again in the washbowl , only for the pleasure of lawbreaking and of carrying a distinguished breath back to the ballroom and the girls . He shook his head , touched for a moment with his giddy and forgotten youth . Later , fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he picked up the telephone book , so dinky and provincial-seeming after the ponderous San Francisco directory that he caught himself feeling protective about it . But when he found the Merrill Funeral Parlors in the yellow pages he sat thinking , struck by the address . 363 East South Temple . On the Avenues side , just below Fourth East . He tried to visualize that once-familiar street but it was all gone except for a general picture of tall stone and brick houses with high porches and lawns overtaken by plantain weeds . One , the one Holly had lived in , had a three-story stone tower . That tower ! With all the Jazz Age Bohemians crawling in and out . Havelock Ellis , Freud , Mencken , The Memoirs of Fanny Hill , Love 's Coming of Age , The Well of Loneliness , harry Kemp , Frank Harris . My Lord . He was flooded with delighted recollection , they were all before him : reed-necked aesthetes , provincial cognoscenti , sad sexy yokels , lovers burning with a hard gemlike Name , a homosexual or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Painters of bile-green landscapes , cubist photographers , poets and iconoclasts , scorners of the bourgeoisie , makers of cherished prose , dream-tellers , correspondence school psychoanalysts , they had swarmed through Holly 's apartment and eddied around her queenly shape with noises like breaking china . He remembered her in her gold gown , a Proserpine or a Circe . For an instant she was slim and tall in his mind and lie saw her laughing in the midst of the excitement she created , and how her hair was smooth black and her eyes very dark blue and how she wore massive gold hoops in her ears . H E WROTE the number down and tucked it in the pocket of the suit laid out on the bed . But when he had dressed and gone down and was walking up South Temple past Beehive House , Lion House , Eagle Gate , the old and new apartment buildings , he began to look ? at numbers with a Feeling that approached suspense , and he searched not so much for the Merrill Funeral Parlors as for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , lifting across the roof of a mansion gone to seed , and in another thirty paces he could see the sign and the new brass numbers on the riser of the top porch step . It was the very house . Quickly he looked around for landmarks to restore and brace his memory . Some of the old maples and hickories he remembered along the sidewalk were gone , the terrace rolled down with an unfamiliar smooth nap of grass . The porch no longer carried its sagging swing , and porch and steps had been renewed and painted . The door was as he remembered it , with lozenges of colored glass above it , and the door knob 's massive handful was an almost startling familiarity . But inside all was changed . Partitions had been gutted out . The stairs now mounted , or levitated , a spiral of white spokes and mahogany rails , from an expanse of plum-colored carpet . Instead of the cupping old parquetry his feet found softness , hushedness . The smells were of paint and flowers . He was eying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office on the left and bent his head a little leftward and said softly and pleasantly , " Yes , sir . Can I help ? " Harris brought himself dryly back to what he had driven eight hundred miles to do . He said , " I 'm Kimball Harris . My aunt , Mrs. George Webb , died day before yesterday at the Julia Hicks Home . They telephoned me she would be here . " " We 've been expecting you , " the young man said , and put out his hand . " My name is McBride . " A brief handshake , a moment when the young man regarded Harris with his head tilted . " Did you fly in ? " he asked . " Drove . " " All the way from San Francisco ? " " I slept a few hours in Elko . " " It was n't so bad , then . " " Oh , no , " Harris said . " Not bad at all . " In his mind was a faint amusement : this young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . He looked better equipped to write fragile verses than deal with corpses . " She 's in the parlor just back here , " McBride said . " Would you like to see her ? She looks very nice . " That would be young McBride 's function , of course . He would he the one who made them look nice . " Maybe later , " Harris said . " I expect there are some details we ought to settle . " " Of course , " McBride said . " If you 'll just step in here . We can look at caskets after a minute . You have a family cemetery plot , I believe ? It will only take a minute for this . The details you can leave to us . " He held the door wide , standing gracefully and deferentially back , and ushered Harris through . A VERY few minutes seemed to settle the details . They rose , facing each other across the desk coolly glimmering in muted afternoon light . " Now would you like to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harris thought . He probably stands back estimating his effects like a window dresser . Mister . McBride , the Mortuary Max Factor . " All right , " he said , " though it 's not as if I had any tears to shed . I have n't seen her for twenty-five years , and she 's been senile for ten . " McBride guided him around the unfamiliar stairs to where the plum carpet flowed smoothly into what had evidently once been a dining room . " She does look nice , " he said . " Very sweet and peaceful . " Which is more than she did alive , Harris thought , and went forward to the table with the basket of chrysanthemums at its foot . To remind himself that this was his mother 's sister , his last near relative , made him feel nothing . Not even a deliberate attempt to squeeze sentimental recollections out of the paSt and remember suppers at Aunt Margaret 's , Christmas visits at Aunt Margaret 's , times when Aunt Margaret had unexpectedlygiven him a quarter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference was so marked that he separated it and noticed it , wondering with a tinge of shame if he was callous . ' He supposed that if he had been attached to the dead woman he might think her peaceful , touching , even terrible . All he could think as he looked at her was that she looked well-embalmed  --  but then she had probably been close to mummified before she died . Old Aunt Margaret , never very lovable , never dear to him in his childhood , and in his maturity only a duty and an expense , thrust her sharp nose , sharp cheekbones , withered lips , up through the rouge and lipstick and was , if she was not a total stranger , only old Aunt Margaret , mercifully dead at eighty-three . Harris did not even feel the conventional disgust with young McBride , who tampered with the dead . Considering what he had had to work with , McBride had done reasonably well . Back in the hall again , he stood looking up the spiral stairs , apparently as unsupported as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three roommates  --  which three did n't matter , they changed so fast  --  came down the old shabby steps arguing about the proportions of the perfect female figure , and he met them on the second landing and like a chorus line they raised their skirts and thrust out their right legs before him , clamoring to know which was the most shapely . An undergraduate Paris and four demanding goddesses . He had picked Holly : why would he not ? . McBride was in the office doorway . " We 've just redone the whole place , " he said " It was the home of a Park City silver king originally , but it was all run down . " Harris was still looking up the stairs . Mc-Bride 's words were no more important than the decorative changes , but upstairs there was something that was important , that pulled at him like an upward draft . " I used to know this house twenty-five years ago , " he said . " Some people I knew had an apartment on the third floor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Front . The one with the round tower window . " " Oh yes , " said McBride . " We have n't done much to that yet  --  just painted it . " " I wonder , " Harris said , and made a little shrugging deprecatory motion and felt irritably ashamed , like a middle-aged man recalling last night 's revels and his own unseemly capers and his pawing of the host 's wife . It was fatuous to want to go up there , yet he did . " Go on up if you want , " McBride said . " The only thing , there 's a woman laid out there . " " Well , then ... " " That would n't matter , if you do n't mind . She 's .. . presentable . " For a moment Harris hung on the word , and on the thought that McBride 's professional vanity was one of the odder kinds , and on a little fit of irritability that a corpse should intrude upon a sentimental but perfectly legitimate impulse . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . " The second-floor hall , at whose doors he had knocked or entered , was as much changed as the ground floor , but up the second flight of stairs he mounted into a growing familiarity . And he climbed against the pressure of a crowd of ghosts . The carpet ended at the stairhead ; he put his feet down softly and held back his breath with the wild notion that he heard voices from the door of Holly 's old apartment . Up these stairs , a hundred , two hundred , three hundred times , through how long ? a year ? two years ? he had come with books or bottles or manuscripts in his hands and ( it seemed to him now ) an incomparable capacity for enthusiasm in his heart . From the high burlap-hung windows of the apartment inside they had let their liquid ridicule fall on the streets of the bourgeois city . He half expocted , as he moved into the doorway , to see their faces look up inquiringly from chair and couch and floor . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was not looking at him . She lay on a wheeled table , with beside her one stiff chair and a taboret bearing a bowl of flowers , all of it composed as if for a macabre still life . Looking toward the windows across the woman 's body he saw how die gray light of afternoon blurred in her carehilly-waved hair . For a minute or two , perhaps , he stood in the doorway , stopped partly by the body and partly by the feeling of an obscure threat : he must summon and gather and recreate his recollections of this room ; he was walking ina strange neighborhood and needed his own gang around him . 1 N HOLLY 'S time the tower bay had held an old upright piano , its backside exposed to the room like the hanging seat of a child 's sleepers . Afternoons , evenings , Sunday and holiday mornings , there had been loud four-hand renderings of " Twelfth Street Rag , " " St. Louis Blues , " them wickedly . That was the morning when he brought Holly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mutinous book full of mottoes for their personalities and their times . But what he remembered now , hanging in the doorway , was how in some lull in the bedlam that always went on there they had found themselves smiling foolishly at each other by the piano and she had put up her hands to his face and kissed him sweet and soft , a kiss like a happy child 's . He realized now that he had recalled that kiss before . waking or sleeping , and that the memory of it had acquired a kind of caption , a fragment of the world 's wisdom contributed to his adolescent store by a returned Mormon missionary : " Das ewig Weibliche fuehri uns hinan , " that remembered moment said . How they had flocked and gathered there , debated , kissed , lied , shocked and astonished and delighted each other , there in the tower with Holly at their center , there by the vanished piano : poets and athletes , Renaissance heroes , fearless Stoics and impassioned Epicureans and abandoned IIedonists , girls with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists and iconoclasts , as delighted with their own wickedness as if it had meant something . He felt the stairs in his legs , the years in his mind , as he went in softly past the woman who lay so quietly on her back , and when he had passed her he turned and searched her face , almost as if he might surprise in it some expression meaningful to this wry and confusing return . She was a plain woman , perhaps fifty . McBride had not yet made her look nice with rouge and lipstick . She lay in a simple black dress , but she had a Navajo squash-blossom necklace around her throat . It struck him as a remarkable piece of realism  --  perhaps some-thing she had especially liked and had stubbornly worn even past the age when costume jewelry became her . It gave her a touching , na  --  vely rakish air . Yet she shed a chill around her , and her silence spread to fill the room . Hardly a sound came through the stone walls . In the old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , two or six or sixteen voices making cosmic conversation . And he never remembered daylight in the apartment . Holly had affected a romantic gloom ; the windows were always shrouded by the artistically-frayed burlap , an.i the light was from lamps , most of them low on the floor and some of them at least with red globes in them . And always the smell of sandalwood . Like a Chinese whorehouse . He shook his head , pitying and entranced , and sat down on the window seat overlooking the reach of South Temple . Directly across was a Five Minute Car Wash with a big apron of concrete and a spick dazzle of white paint and red tiles . In the times he remembered , that lot had held a Peewee Golf Course where men in shirt sleeves , women in summer dresses , young couples loud with laughter , putted little white balls along precise green alleys and across precise circles of green artificial grass and over gentle and predictable bridges and causeways into numbered holes . " Look . at them , " Holly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down at the after-dinner golfers moving under the bright floodlights . " Toujours gai , my God . Some day I 'm , F 0oino. golf to build a miniature olf course with fairways six inches wide and rough all over the place . I 'll fill the water holes with full-sized crocodiles and sow the sandtraps with sidewinders . How would it be to hide a black widow spider in every hole so that holing out and pid:ing up your ball would earn you some excitement ? What if you sawed the supports of all the little bridges nearly in two ? " Live it dangerously . It was strange to recall how essential that had seemed . Go boom , take chances . He touched the casement windows , thinking that this was the pose , sitting right here and looking out , that Holly had assumed when Tom Stead painted her in her gold velvet gown . Probably that portrait was n't anything special . It could n't have been . The chances were that Tom Stead - ik- as painting signs somewhere now , if lie had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , in the presence of its subject whose life overflowed upon them all , that slim golden shape with the velvet highlights was Lilith , Helen , Guenevere , das ewig Weibliche . And it was hardly a day before other girls , less fortunately endowed or graced , had begun dropping comments on how warm that Stead-Holly romance was getting , and hinting that there was hidden away somewhere a companion portrait  --  a nude . Well , well , what a bunch of Bohemian puritans . Harris did not believe in any nude , or in its importance if there had been one , though at the time it had bothered him , and he had been malely offended , surprised that she would lower herself , you know ? Now , sitting bemused in the window , he reflected that what had truly shone out of that golden portrait , as out of Holly herself , was not so much glamour as innocence . Under the sheath she was positively virginal ; if you cracked the enamel of her sophistication you found a delighted little girl playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the piano on a Christmas morning , and he stood up so sharply that he startled himself with the sight of the dead woman . It was innocence . She could put away the predatory paws of college boys , twist laughing from the casual kiss , pass among the hot young Freudians as untouched as a nun , shed like water the propositions that were thrown at her seven to the week . There she sat in her gold gown by her window opening on the foam : a maiden in a tower . H E CROSSED the room and tried the bedroom door , wanting to look in on her intimately . In this room , now completely bare , aseptically painted , lie had sat dozens of times when she was ill or when on Sunday mornings she made it a charming point of her sophistication to entertain in bed . While she lay propped with pillows he had read to her , talked to her , kissed her , had his hands fended away . The empty room was still charged with the vividness with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two or three o'clock , when he had sat on one side of the bed and a mournful and lovesick jazz trumpeter had sat on the other , neither willing to leave the other alone there , and all that night he had read aloud into the smell of sandalwood the life story of a mad woman from Butte , Montana . I , Mary MacLean , that one was called . What an occasion she made of it , laid up by flu , hemmed in by rival young men , covered to the chin in an absurd , high-necked. old-fashioned nightgown , taking aspirin with sips of ginger beer , laughing at them alternately or together with that face as vivid do the pillow as a flower laid against the linen . It was innocence . In that crackpot Bohemian pre-crash wonderful time , it was innocence . How he and the trumpeter broke the deadlock , what had ever happened to the Tom Stead flurry , what had happened to any of Holly 's string of admirers  --  all gone . She sent them away . or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grew huffy at finding her always in a crowd . Plenty of self-appointed humming-bird catchers , but no captures . And yet , maybe . . S UMMER and winter , day and night , were telescoped in his memory . How old would he have been ? Twenty ? Twenty-one ? It must have been near the end of Holly 's reign in this apartment , before everything went sour and the delayed wave of the crash reached them and he left school to go to work and Holly herself went away . There was neither beginning nor end nor definite location in time to what he most vividly remembered . What they were doing , whether there had been a party there or whether they had been out on a date , NV lictIter she had roommates then or was living alone , none of that came back . But they were alone in a way they had seldom been . They must have been talking , something must have led up to it , for there she was with the clarity of something floodlighted in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his chest , clinging and crying and saying  --  lie heard only the refrain , not the garble against his chest ? " Kim , Kim , get inc out of here ! I want to get out of this . This is all no good , I 've got to , Kim , please ! " Both the tears and the way she clung excited him . But the game had been played so long by other rules that he went on in the old way , laughing , burlesquing gestures of consolation , patting the crow-wing hair , saying , " There there , little girl . " Inanities , idiocies . . . She wore an evening dress cut very low in the back , and he played his fingers up and down her spine . He slid his hand in against her skin , slid it further , expecting the competent twist and shrug and fending and the laugh that would mean the emotional fit was over . But his hand went on around , clear around , and with a shock like an internal explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even remembering , all his sensations were shocking to him . He remembered how smoothly the curve of her side swelled upward , how astonishingly consecutive her body seemed . Also , also , and almost with revulsion , how rigid and demanding the nipple of her breast . Innocence  --  he had never touched a girl there , never imagined , or rather had imagined wrong . Stupefied by the sudden admission to her flesh , made uneasy by the way she crowded and clung , he stood wrapping her awkwardly , and kissed her and tasted her tears , and thought with alarm and conviction of Tom Stead and the rumored nude , and was anguished with eagerness to escape . He could remember not a scrap , not a detail , of how he got . away . She offered herself passionately in his memory , and that was all . The Peewee Golfer putting his little white ball up the little green alley of his youth came suddenly upon the sidewinder in the sand-trap , the crocodile in the artificial lake . Harris closed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occur to him that he had been an extraordinary young man , and very little of what had been extraordinary about himself pleased him . Innocence ? Well , maybe , though there were more contemptuous names for it . He had been a fraud , a garglcr of whisky he would obediently not drink . A great yapper with the crowd , but when the cat stopped running , what a Frantic sliding to a stop , what digging not to catch what he was after . Weakly he tried to prop up the slack thing he had been . He told himself that it was a pose with all of them , the life that revolved around Holly was an absurd and perhaps touching and certainly unimportant part of growing up . Or was it ? What might he be at this moment , would he have more or less to regret , if he had taken holly at her passionate word , married her , lived it , as she was determined to live it in her innocence , dangerously ? The last time he saw Holly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to Shanghai and a job they all publicly envied but would probably not have risked takin ? . themselves . Her life , whatever happened to her , would not have been dull . And yet it might have been more thoroughly wasted than at that moment he thought his own had been . Ile had played it the other way , not so much from choice as from yielding to pressures , and he had done the best he could with How would lie look to Holly now , at this very minute ? How had he looked then ? Like a bubble of gas from something submerged and decaying in deep water then. , rose to the surface of his mind one of Blake 's proverbs of Hell that they had admired together that long-crOne Christmas morning . burst , and it said , " Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity . " It shamed him to remember , though he half repudiated it . From the life of prudence he had got a wife he loved and respected , children he adored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content . He regretted none of them . But he stood here remembering that moment when Holly stopped playing make-believe , and it seemed to him that his failure to take her when she offered herself was one of the saddest failures of his life . The fact that he might make all the same crucial choices the same way if he had them to make again helped not at all ; it did him no good to remind himself that no one could turn in any direction without turning his back on something . The past had trapped him , and it held him like pain . NGRILY he looked at his watch . Past five . Starting for the door , he passed the dead woman 's table and saw her calm pale face , the skin delicately wrinkled like the skin of a winter-kept apple , but soft-looking , as if it would be not unpleasant to touch . What was her name , what had she died of , what had she looked like when she wore expression ? Who mourned her , who had loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had she regretted ? Would they think it disagreeable that a total stranger had been alone with her here staring into her dead face ? And in that face what was it that the caution of death enclosed and hid ? The barbaric silver necklace seemed somehow to define her . What it said of frivolity , girlishness , love of ornament and of gaiety and of life , made him like her ; the way it lay on the sober black crepe breast preached the saddest lesson he had ever derived . He thought of how she had been transported and tampered with by McBride , and how further touches of disguise would complete her transformation from something real and terrible and lost to something serene , removed , bearable . Alone with her here , before the arrival of the others , before she went plete her transformation from something real anguish for this woman he had never known , and a strange gratitude that he had been permitted to see her . Gratitude , or something near it . And yet as he started for the door he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet and empty as a chapel , and at the woman who lay so quietly at its center . He meant to tiptoe out , but he heard , almost with panic , the four quick raps his heels made on the bare floor before they found the consoling softness of the stairs .
