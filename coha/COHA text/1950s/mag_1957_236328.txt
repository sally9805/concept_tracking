Express train D-961 slid out of Salzburg at 9:53 p.m. bound for Munich . It was 13 minutes late-not too bad for the holiday season and a Saturday night . But up in the electric locomotive , Engineer Oskar Sauerbrey gave it a lot of thought . He throttled her up . " I think we are going too fast , " yelled Fireman Karl Rupp . Engineer Oskar simply opened the throttle some more-to 60 m.p.h. ( the permitted limit ) , to 70 , 80 , 84 . Back in the diner , cups and saucers crashed from cupboards , and in the compartments , people locked arms to keep from smashing against the walls . Women fainted in the aisles . A doctor was knocked unconscious by a tumbling suitcase as he treated his sixth patient . <P> Up steep inclines , around mountain curves at 75 m.p.h. , D-961 , spitting sparks and smoke from the wheels , zipped along until at last , 39 miles out of Salzburg , a 21-year-old diner steward took matters into his own hands , pulled the emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prien , Stationmaster Johann Birner , roused by frantic phone calls from down the line , said to Oskar : " Lokomotivfhrer , I think you are drunk . " <P> The stationmaster was so right . Last week , before a Bavarian judge , Oskar and his fireman admitted that before boarding D-961 they had each downed five pints of strong Austrian beer and three Stamperln of liqueur . When the judge asked how big a Stamperl is , Oskar sheepishly pulled a liqueur glass from his pocket . For their wild night , the injuries to eleven of the 720 passengers , and the damages to six railway cars , the judge gave Oskar 18 months in prison and his fireman a year .
