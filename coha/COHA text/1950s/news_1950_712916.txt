txt New telephone rates , designed to produce an over-all increase of 3 per cent in New York Telephone Company revenues , were approved unanimously yesterday by the Public Service Commission . For a few residential subscribers the new schedule represents an actual or potential cut below present charges and for some business subscribers an increase of almost 24 per cent . The big jump in the business rate applies to service in the outer areas of Bronx , Queens , Brooklyn and Richmond . In Manhattan and near-by sections of the Bronx , Queens and Brooklyn , the business rate increase is 8 per cent . The most drastic change calls for raising the basic charge for use of coin box telephones from 5 cents to 10 cents , effective on Jan. 1 . Until this change is put into effect the company was authorized to impose a 2 per cent surcharge on all basic monthly bills . The delay in making the new coin box rate effective was ascribed to the time needed for mechanical changes in coin box and central office equipment . To File @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers are expected to become effective Sunday , after new schedules rxe filed with the commission , probably today or tomorrow , a company spokesman said . Together with the .8 per cent temporary rate increase that the commission approved last June , the new rates are calculated to produce a total of $48,490,000 in new revenue . Of this , the commission estimated , $29,000,000 will be available for company purposes ; the rest will go for taxes , principally Federal income taxes . In its petition for a rate increase , filed two Mears ago , the company asked for additional revenue of $63,490,000. which , it said , would leave it a net of $37,650,000 after taxes . Of the reduction made by the commission in the company 's request , $10,550,000 was shaved off proposed rate increases Ifor New York City and $4,450,000 from the proposed changes elsewhere in the state . Inadequate , Company Says Keith S. , president of the New York Telephone Company , expressed disappointment last night that the commission did not grant a larger increase . " The new rates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable it to continue to meet the service requirements of customers , " he said . " These requirements are very large and to meet them we must continue to raise from $75,000,000 to $100,000,000 of new capital each year . The company 's credit must be tops to do this . " After taxes , the total increase allowed is still less than one half the total improvement that has taken place in employe wage schedules alone in the past decade . " Practically we are left with no alternative but to make the new rates effective , but it is obvious that a further increase in rates is needed . " Income Tax Considered Rates to business subscribers are increased more steeply than those to residential users . In arriving at this determination the commission appeared to take into account the fact that business subscribers can deduct telephone costs from earnings for income tax purposes while- residential users can not . , An analysis of the new schedule mad . by the commission indicated that a majority of residential users will pay little more under the new schedules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few the new rates will be lower than at any time since 19$0 . Two types of service are provided for business and residential users in this city and in most other parts of the state . One provi &ee; for an unlimited number of calls within a specified area and the other for a specified number of calls or message units ( overtime being counted as additional calls ) within a somewhat larger area . Under the new schedule the // message rate for individual line service in New York City is increased by 16 to 18 cents a month but the number of messages allowed for the minimum is raised from sixty-six to seventy-five . Assigning a value of 5 cents each fox the additional messages , there will be a net decrease in cost to the subscriber if all the messages are used . The increase over pre-war rates on the same basis will be only 5 cents a month . The new schedule for message rate service on a two-party line in the city is cut below the existing temporary rate by 1 or 3 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fiftyseven to sixty a month . Assuming all messages are used the net increase over pre-war charges is 10 cents a month . In an eighty-page decision , the commission said that subscribers in Nassau and Westchester Counties and those in New York City who have occasion to make calls to Nassau and Westchester will benefit greatly by the start of the company 's so-called Metropolitan Plan in connection with putting the new rate schedule into effect . Calling Area Extended Under this plan the New York City local calling area will be extended to include Westchester and Nasau and all existing toll rates between the city and most points in Westchester and Nassau will be abolished , Calls in the new extended area will be billed on the basis of message units . For instance , a subscriber in Nassau or Westchester making a call to New York would be charged with three or four message units instead of a 10 or 15-cent toll charge . The maximum charge for a call from any part of the so-called metropolitan area to any other part will be six messages for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nassau and Westchester , as well as message-rate subscribers , will benefit also from an enlargement of the area they may call for a single-message charge . According to a computation included by the commission in its opinion , subscribers in the metropolitan area would have paid $4,000,000 less than they did in 1949 if the plan had been in effect at that time . With the new rate increases for different types of service , the savings will be Less now . With respect to business service in New York City it was explained by the commission that all such service is now on an individual line message-rate basis . For rate purposes . the company divides New York into two groups of rate zones , known as the inner and outer zones . The inner zone includes all of Manhattan , the southern part of the Bronx and near-by areas in Brooklyn and Queens . The outer zone includes the rest of the city . Under the new schedule the rate for single-line business service in the inner zone is increased by 52 cents a month over the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $1.10 a month more . Increases are provided also in the new schedule for multiple line and private branch exchange service . Flat Rate Used Widely Outside of New York City and Buffalo , both residential and business service are billed predominantly on a flat-rate basis . According to a commission analysis the new rates for two-party , fourparty and rural line . flat residential service are virtually the same as those now in effect . Except in Albany and Syracuse , where the ' cost of two-party service is raised 22 cents a month , the increase in Ithe other areas ranges from 3 to 9 cents a month . In some cases these increases are offset by an enlargement of the free calling area . For individual line flat-rate service the residential charge outside of New York City and Buffalo is increased from 16 to 30 cents a month , depending upon the number of telephones in the area served . In the case of individual line and party line service rates for particular localities vary generally in accordance with the number of telephones reachable through exchanges in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there are up to 1,400 telephones . For business service outside of New York City and the Buffalo metropolitan area , the new rates represent an increase of $1 or less a month , depending upon the number of telephones in the " free area . " Special treatment is provided in the new rates for calls made from hotels . Under the pre-war rate schedule hotel guests were charged 10 cents for outgoing local calls , part of the extra fee being retained by the hotel and part going to the telephone company . On outgoing intra-state toll calls up to 50 cents , hotel guests paid a 5-cent surcharge and on all toll calls over 50 cents they paid a 10-cent surcharge . Under the new rate schedule hotels will be permitted to charge 15 cents for each outgoing local-call and an additional 5 cents for each message unit above one ; a charge of 10 cents for each outgoing toll call where the toll rate is 50 cents or less and 15 cents on toll calls exceeding that amount and a further charge of 10 cents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in coin box rates was foreshadowed last year when the commission approved a temporary rate increase of 8 per cent . In its opinion at that time the commission noted that coin box service was not paying its proportionate share of the cost of maintaining telephone service . Amplifying its earlier views yesterday , the commission said that regular subscribers would have to pay $14,000,000 more a year to give the company the additional revenue justified by the facts in the case unless the coin box rate was raised . " We must consider not only the revenue effect to the company , " the commission opinion said , " but should adopt a form of rate which is least burdensome to the user . To illustrate , the increase in coin box rates will cost the users of coin boxes $12,000,000 annually and will produce the same amount of additional revenue for the company . If $12,000,000 in revenue to the company were to be raised from regular subscribers it would cost the subscribers $14,000,000 because of the Federal excises that are added to the consumer 's bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted to the New York Telephone Company since 1930 on a permanent basis . According to commission experts , the rate case was the largest in the commission 's history . The decision was based on 10,000 pages of testimony taken at seventy-eight hearings in various parts of the state , 477 exhibits and a number of independent studies made by the commission staff . In arriving at its final determination , the commission rejected a contention advanced on behalf of Mayor O'Dwyer and the city administration that the city should be considered apart from the rest of the state in connection with fixing rates . To do so , the commission said , would lead " to complete administrative nonsense . "
