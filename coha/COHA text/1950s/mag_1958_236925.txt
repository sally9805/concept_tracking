MOSES , PRINCE OF EGYPT ( 303 pp. ) - Howard Fast-Crown ( $3.95 ) . <P> JEPHTA AND HIS DAUGHTER ( 255 pp. ) - Lion Feuchtwanger-Putnam ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> St. Paul told the Corinthians that " the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance . " In latter days Moses has been psychoanalyzed by Freud ( Moses and Monotheism ) and has taken his turn at the treaDeMille ( The Ten Commandments ) . Now . ex-Communist Howard Fast , veteran of 14 mostly ideological novels ( Citizen Tom Paine , Freedom Road ) , has turned out what looks like Volume I of a Mosaic saga with overtones of both Freud and DeMille . <P> From Egypt to Sinai . Fast agrees with Freud and others that Moses ' monotheism is traceable to the great Egyptian monarch , AkhenAton ( also known as Ikhnaton ) , who forswore all gods save the Sun-God Aton . But where Freud guessed that Moses was an Egyptian by birth . Novelist Fast makes him an Egyptian merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of the old gods and their priests caused AkhenAton 's successors to denounce Aton worship , but not before the idea of monotheism had taken root in some Egyptian minds . In Fast 's account , every priest and prince in the great Nile palace of King Ramses II is sworn to polytheism , but an Aton underground passes the teachings of monotheism from one generation to another . Enekhas-Amon. sister ( and bedmate ) of Ramses , is herself an Atonist , and she spots Baby Moses in the bulrushes , where his captive Levite mother has left him as a sacrifice to the water-snake god . Enekhas-Amon takes the infant , reappears at court months later pretending that the child is hers . One day , she dreams . Moses will ascend the throne and restore Aton to his sole supremacy .
