To East Berlin last week went the intellectual acrobats and performing seals of Communism 's traveling peace circus . Two hundred strong , they staged their third meeting of the World Peace Council beneath a Barnum- &-Bailey-sized; replica of Picasso 's peace dove . And as usually happens when Communists gather under a big tent , the verbal contortionists stole the show . <P> French Nuclear Physicist Joliot-Curie led off with an exhibition of how to face in two directions at once . In one breath he told the council that U.S. troops in Europe and Korea should go back home where they came from . In the next , he implored the rest of the world to " help the American people out of the isolation in which they are being kept . " But it was Ringmaster Stalin 's favorite literary gymnast , Author Ilya Ehrenburg , who brought down the house with a faultless demonstration of how to say one thing while meaning another . <P> " We respect the American people , " cooed Ehrenburg , suppressing the other Russian line about the germ-spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We respect their genius , their achievements in science , their inventiveness , their industry . " As for the " happy-go-lucky American character , " Ehrenburg admitted that it does have a " certain charm . " " It is time the plain American should understand that Russians are not massing to deprive him of his little Ford , that the Chinese have no intention of meddling with his television programs , that Koreans do not lust after Mr. Smith 's refrigerator . <P> The Soviet people want peace , not because they are fainthearted and weak , but be cause they are truly generous . They want peace with America , with the America of the Progressives , the Republicans and the Democrats . " In the U.S. , Ehrenburg went on , the people are allowed to choose be tween Democrats and Republicans , be tween psychiatry and physiotherapy , be tween vacations in Florida and the Rock ies . But not between war &; peace . <P> <P> Now the olive branch disappeared and out came the stick . Unlike the Russians , Ehrenburg told a cheering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a little group of madmen dreaming of a new war ... If this handful of criminals decides to impose the American way of life on the world by force of arms , that way of life will collapse like a pack of cards . " <P> With these peaceful words , Contortionist Ehrenburg took his seat and the trained seals flapped their flippers thunderously.
