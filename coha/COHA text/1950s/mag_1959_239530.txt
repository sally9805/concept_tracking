Shortly after Sir Malcolm Campbell died in 1948 , his son Donald learned that a U.S. sportsman was preparing an assault on Sir Malcolm 's world water-speed record of 141.74 m.p.h . " By God , they wo n't have that record , " vowed Donald , " not without a fight they wo n't have it . " <P> Then 27 , Donald Campbell was not well prepared to make a fight of it ( " I 'd never traveled at more than 70 m.p.h. on water , and not much more on land " ) . But he learned . The U.S. 's Stanley Sayres duly broke Sir Malcolm 's record in 1950. but by T955 Donald had it back in the family . In his jet-powered Bluebird II , he roared up and down the course on England 's Lake Ullswater at an average speed of 202.32 m.p.h . <P> Since then , Campbell has held the record unchallenged and upped it every year . But the magic 300-m.p.h. mark on water has become to Campbell what Mount <P> Everest 's summit was to Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <P> Last week , as his Belgian-born wife Tonia looked on and " prayed all the time , " 38-year-old Don Campbell took Bluebird , slightly modified with stabilizing fin and redesigned rudder , in a foam-washed scud across the smooth surface of Lake Coniston in Lancashire at 275.15 m.p.h. , negotiated the return run in 245.55 for an average of 260.35-breaking his record of 248.62 made last year . <P> An uncompromising man , Speedster Campbell was not content , declared he would try for 300 m.p.h. again in 1960 . Still more uncompromisingly , he has announced his intention to make 400 m.p.h. on land , is now building a new jet-driven car ( also to be named Bluebird ) to try for the land mark next year at Utah 's Bonneville salt flats . Said he : " I have decided to retire after I have got the double . " <P> For the first time in years , Campbell has a serious U.S. challenger : Bandleader Guy Lombardo , who is building a new aluminum jet-propelled hydroplane that he will try out this fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We figured when we planned our boat , " he said , " that we would have to design it to go 300 m.p.h . I 'm confident we 'll beat Campbell 's record . "
