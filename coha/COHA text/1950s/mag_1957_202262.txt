For one moment last April , the Kadar regime let the world glimpse its version of justice . In the course of secretly trying some 5,000 " criminals " ( at least 113 of whom have been sentenced to death ) , Kadar decided to hold an open trial of eleven young Freedom Fighters . For his winning examples he chose Medical Student Ilona Toth , Editor Gyula Obersovszky , Playwright Jozsef Gali and eight others including an army lieutenant , charged them with having murdered an AVH man who had discovered that they were putting out a mimeographed revolutionary sheet called We Live ! ( TIME , April 22 ) . <P> The trial was a public-relations flop for Kadar , aroused widespread sympathy for tearful , blonde Ilona Toth . An embarrassed Communist woman judge brusquely sentenced Ilona , the army lieutenant and one other to death . The comparatively mild prison sentences handed down to Obersovszky and Gali were later reversed ; both , together with a third defendant , were on appeal condemned to death . <P> The appeal trial brought a deluge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including British Philosopher Bertrand Russell , Scientist Julian Huxley , Peru 's President Manuel Prado , Hungarian Writer Paul Igno-tus , French ex-Fellow Traveler Jean-Paul Sartre , as well as from such Communists as Artist Pablo Picasso and Poet Louis Aragon ( who was later outraged to learn that the capitalist press knew of his appeal ) . Seemingly impressed , the Kadar regime said last week that , " pending re-examination of the case , " it had " suspended " the death sentences of Intellectuals Obersovszky and Gali . But three days later it showed its complete contempt for world opinion by hanging youthful ( 25 ) Student Toth and her three Freedom-Fighting comrades .
