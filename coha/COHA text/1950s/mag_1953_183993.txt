Sloan Simpson Show ( weekdays 9:05 p.m. , station WOR ) stars the ex-wife of New York 's ex-Mayor Bill O'Dwyer . On a typical show , breathless , throaty-voiced ex-Model Sloan gave a brief review of the Walt Disney movie . The Living Desert ( " Really most unusual " ) , interviewed two sponsors of Manhattan 's Blue Cotillion Ball ( " When most people think of balls they are apt to think they are selfish-but this one is for a most worthy cause " ) , and ended her 25-minute show with a plug for a midtown restaurant ( " It 's wonderful for hand-holding " ) . Though not quite as sure of herself as Maggi McNellis and Jinx Falkenburg , Newcomer Sloan is already as determinedly chatty as any veteran lady of the airways . <P> Motorola TV Hour ( alt . Tues. 9:30 p.m. , ABC-TV ) , another worthy competitor for TV dramatic honors , is handsomely produced , well-cast and ambitiously directed . The TV Hour 's only apparent handicap is a lack of good scripts . Last week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin , and the plot leaned heavily on devices borrowed from Carol Reed films and Charles Dickens ' A Tale of Two Cities . Jack Palance was effective as the present-day Sydney Carton who gives his life to free Maria Riva 's husband from a Communist death cell . <P> Dr. I.Q. ( Thurs. 9 p.m. , ABC-TV ) had a 20-year run on radio , and should be notably successful on TV . As before , Dr. I.Q. ( Jay Owen ) fires his questions from a theater stage while his four assistants track down contestants in the audience ( " I have a lady in the balcony , Doctor ! " ) . The quiz payoff is made in silver dollars , and the questions are as hard as ever ( " Name the states that border on the Mississippi River " ) . With its dramatic values considerably heightened by television , Dr. I.Q. is not likely to remain unsponsored for long . <P> Peter Potter Show ( Sun . 9:30 p.m. , ABC-TV ) requires a group of pop-music experts , e.g. , Johnnie Ray , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new records . The proceedings are dominated by Disk Jockey Peter Potter , whose special brand of sugary archness is sometimes topped by the coy commercials for Hazel Bishop lipstick .
