( See Cover ) <P> He 's the man that we need ; We 'll all follow his lead . He 's our Adlai , our Adlai , our Adlai , our Adlai , Our Adlai 's a wonderful guy . <P> According to George Gallup , about 45% of U.S. voters could now sing Our Adlai with something approaching full-throated conviction . That 's a lot of voters-and a fraction more than the polls gave Harry Truman at a comparable time in 1948 . But in some respects it is a wonder that anyone has a chance to sing Our Adlai at all . Ten months ago , Adlai Stevenson was not even a name in the national consciousness ; his rise has been unmatched in U.S. politics since Wendell Willkie 's star raced across the sky in 1940 . <P> How did Stevenson get there ? What turned him from a reluctant candidate into an aggressive campaigner ? And what kind of sense is he making to the American people ? <P> He and his opponent , two very dissimilar men , have a common problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knit and fractious party . Each is the leader of his party , at least for the duration of the campaign ; and each is , to some extent , his party 's captive . <P> Days of Doubt . The requirements for the 1952 Democratic candidate were cheerfully laid down last May by Harry Truman . At the convention of the Americans for Democratic Action , a left-of-center group that generally lines up with the Democrats , Harry Truman said : " When a Democratic candidate allows himself to be put on the defensive and starts apologizing for the New Deal and the Fair Deal . . . he is sure to lose . The people do n't want a phony Democrat . If it 's a choice between a genuine Republican and a Republican in Democratic clothing , the people will choose the genuine article every time . That is , they 'll take the Republican ... I do n't want any phony Democrats in this campaign . " <P> At that time , Adlai Stevenson was certainly reluctant to be the Democratic nominee . His reluctance was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his horror of a Truman endorsement and his desire to continue his promising career as governor of Illinois . At that time , Ike was thought to be invincible , Truman was regarded as ballot-box poison and Stevenson was sure of re-election as governor . <P> As convention time came nearer , and after Ike got the Republican nomination , the pressure on Stevenson to say yes or no became almost unbearable . In Minnesota , asked what he would do if he got the nomination , he gave a hoot of nervous laughter and said : " I guess I 'd just shoot myself . " Two days before the convention opened , in a more serious tone , he told his own Illinois delegates not to vote for him , saying that he did not aspire to the presidency and was " temperamentally , physically and mentally " unfitted for the job . Told of a Washington story that President Truman had decided to support him , he said : " Dear God , no ! "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
