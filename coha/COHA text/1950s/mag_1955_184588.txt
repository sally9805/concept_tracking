In a shed on San Francisco 's Embarcadero last week stood three young men , stiff and ill at ease , listening intently while an MP captain read an official paper . They had just had a happy reunion with their families , whom they had not seen in five years , and now the unpleasantness was about to begin . <P> " By command of the commanding general , Sixth Army , each of you is hereby taken into custody , " barked Captain Walter R. Leahy . " You are further advised that court-martial charges have been preferred against you ... " When the captain finished reading the charges , three husky MPs stepped up to the young men and marched them off to a weapons carrier . Minutes later , the forbidding gates of the prison compound at Fort Baker clanked shut behind them . <P> Just 18 months earlier , the same young men had stood in the " Peace Pagoda " in Panmunjom , Korea , and damned their country . They had spurned the pleas of the families they greeted so warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more forbidding wall . Now , disillusioned with Communism , they had come home to face whatever penalty their native land would impose . <P> For William Cowart , 22 , Lewis Griggs , 22 , and Otho Bell , 24 , recently of Communist China , the grim homecoming was a portent of a grimmer future . They faced punishment ( maximum penalty : death ) for acts committed against their country and fellow Americans while they were prisoners of war in Korea . Each was accused of the gravest crimes under military law-aiding the enemy and ratting on their brothers-in-arms . <P> Though the Army 's case against the three-compiled from the testimony of hundreds of loyal ex-P.W.s-looked substantial enough , there was some doubt about the Army 's right to try them . Technically , Bell , Cowart and Griggs are civilians-dishonorably discharged from the Army at the time they , and 18 other American turncoats , turned their backs on their homeland and families and disappeared into Red China . But since 1950 , the armed forces have claimed the right to seize and court-martial civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legality of that claim , as set forth in the 1950 Uniform Code of Military Justice , will soon be tested in court. * But if the Army should lose jurisdiction over the three , the Justice Department is prepared to step in and prosecute them as civilians . <P> <P> * Veteran Robert Toth was arrested by air police in Pittsburgh in 1953 and flown to Korea to stand trial on a charge of murder committed while he was in the Air Force ( TIME , Aug. 31 , 1953 ) . Before the court-martial could be called , however , the Air Force was forced to return him to the U.S. , and Toth was released under a writ of habeas corpus . His case , a test of the military 's authority over some 21 million living veterans , is pending before the Supreme Court .
