Dale Jr. , " Basic Inquiry Into a Baffling Inflation " ( Aug. 25 ) : Circa 1600 , John Shakespeare , the father of William Shakespeare , owned a piece of property which he rented for eight pounds per year . This appears in an abbreviated life of Shakespeare , with a note stating " This would now ( 1859 ) be forty pounds per year . " So , in 259 years the value of the pound depreciated 500 per cent , and it has depreciated at least 100 per cent since . This would seem to indicate that inflation is a continuing process . Only wild inflation is to be feared . CLARENCE DOTTENHEIM . New York . PROFITS AND WAGES To THE EDITOR : As a college student whose tuition has recently been adjusted upward to meet rising costs , I am deeply concerned about the problem of inflation as outlined in Mr. Dale 's article . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing what a great many people are convinced is a wage inflation . We are told that the great producers of steel , for example , are forced to raise their prices . as a result of labor 's successful bargaining for higher wages . And the way to prevent that rise in prices is for labor to stop demanding increases in wages . But this logic fails to answer the seldom asked question : Why , when profits are higher than ever , can not the titans of American industry absorb increases in labor costs without raising prices ? Are we to say that the stockholder in U. S. Steel has a right to demand increased dividend earnings , while the man who makes the increase possible has no right to demand a better standard of living ? HARVARD HOLLENBMG . New York . GROWING YOUNG TO THE EDITOR : I wish to express to Dr. David Stonecypher how provocative his article ( " Old Age Need Not Be ' Old , ' " ( Aug. 18 ) was to me . To be seventy years young is sometimes far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one grows old by the number of years but by deserting his or her ideals . General quoted the following several years ago : " In everyone 's heart there is a recording chamber , and so long as it receives messagas of beauty , hope and courage , so long are we young , but when the wires are all down ? then , and then only , are we grown old . " Those lines have never left my mind . NORMA OPPENHEIM . New York . F. D. R. AND COURT TO THE EDITOR : In the article by Prof. Bernard Schwartz , " Is the Criticism of the High Court Valid ? " ( Aug. 25 ) , the statement is made that President Roosevelt , while attacking the decisions of the Supreme Court , had never questioned its prerogatives . If you will consult the files of the newspapers at the time of Mr. Roosevelt 's attack ' on the court , you will find that he expressed opposition to the theory that , as he put it , in an emergency laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwartz ' article the following sentences : " Opinion is stronger in America than anywhere else in the world . To yield a little may be prudent , for the tree that can not bend to the blast may be bronen . " This same language is contained in Bryce , " The American Commonwealth , " but I find no reference to this fact in Professor Schwartz ' article . THOMAS RAEBURN WHITE . Philadelphia . Professor Schwartz replies : " The first paragraph of Mr. White 's letter must be a misprint . Roosevelt supported ? he did not express opposition to  --  the theory that in an emergency laws had to be constitutional . Even so , this in no way brought into question the authority of the court but only the decisions invalidating the New Deal laws . " As for the Bryce statement , the passage is so famous to students of the court that it would be as hard to plagiarize as a passage from Shakespeare . Perhaps I should have added a footnote referring to the source ( as I do in my recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper piece . " MACHINES ' AGES To THE EDITOR : In an article , " Statistical Stew " ( Sept. 1 ) , W. E. Farbstein writes about the life expectancy of stoves , refrigerators and washing machines . - Well , it happens I live in cooperative housing and the above items came up for discussion as to their life expectancy . I made some interesting discoveries . I have been given ' the following information : cooking stoves , twenty to twenty-five years ; refrigerator , at least eighteen to twenty years , and washing machines , ten years . These figures on life expectancy are very low because in actual practice they last many years longer , which is what I 've found out by talking with landlords and people who own their own homes and from my personal experience . JOE HALPERN . New York . STEADY DATING TO THE EDITOR : May I enlarge the expression of my views on teen-age steady-dating , published in the " Letters " column of the July 28 issue ? " Going steady " is the current teen-age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as to the specific inseeprity of possibly going dateless . The " security " of " going steady , " however , is a false security , ultimately leading to heightened anxiety in the steady daters , who worry about ( 1 ) " holding " their " steady " ; ' ( 2 ) the possibility of ostracism if they lose their " steady " ; ( 3 ) the possibility that they are missing out on other boys and girls , leading to a conflict between an attraction to another ands a loyalty to the " steady . " The dating system itself creates insecurity in both sexes , since only boys may ask for dates . This system puts girls at the mercy of boys who // Letters // are socially less mature and certainly unequipped to deal fairly with the power they have . There are two means of achieving real security in dating to replace the false security of " going steady , " which a minority of teen-agers now adopt : ( 1 ) the encouragement of group-dating , through such organizations as P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temples , and other community organizations ; ( 2 ) development of equality-of-sexes in dating , by running affairs in high schools to which girls can invite boys , and " cut in " at dances . Unless community approaches such as these are made to relieve the anxiety inherent in the current dating system , teen-agers will understandably continue to try " going steady "  --  and will continue to be disillusioned by this " fool 's gold " in their search for dating security . JOHN J. MORGENSTERN , Ph.D . Chief Clinical Psychologist , Warren County Mental Hygiene Association . Glens Falls , N. Y. ON BIGNESS IN BUSINESS TO THE EDITOR : In his article , " A Defense of Bigness in Business , " ( Aug. 4 ) Sumner H. Slichter recognizes the many positive values contributed to the United States economy by competition under America 's unique antitrust policy . Mr. Slichter accurately points out that this competition has contributed to the development in the United States of huge business enterprises that alone account for more production than do entire industries in other free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these benefits , in a puzzling course of reasoning Mr. Slichter arrives at the strange conclusion that the best way for the American people to assure continuation of the benefits from competition is to relax the antitrust laws that prohibit mergers and to relax existing prohibitions against monopolization . Mr. Slichter would have us believe that some mysterious alchemy provided by the economic planning and technological research of the leaders of our largest corporations would convert his proposed antitrust relaxations into stimuli for increased competition . My own experience from Congressional investigations into the activities of corporate executives brings me to sharply different conclusions . For a number of years I have been privileged to serve as chairman of special committees with jurisdiction to investigate antitrust subjects . Investigations into the operations of a number of industries has convinced me that to preserve the competition that is so essential to American economic well-being we must have , indeed , a more vigilant application of our antitrust standards . A selective strengthening , not a relaxation , of our antitrust laws is required to remove deficiencies as they are disclosed by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommends not only would fail w preserve the competitive values he praises , but , on the contrary , I believe would do much to destroy competition . One of the primary reasons Mr. Slichter fails to recognize any danger from the growth of the " concentrate " pattern in American industry , and which underlies his plea for relaxation of our antitrust safeguards , is the competition he foresees in the fields of research and development . This type of competition , I believe , does not afford sufficient protection to the public . There is unanswered as yet the question of the optimum size that is needed to support an aggressive and productive research laboratory . It can not , for example , be contended successfully that , had the Government in its antitrust case against A. T. &; T. been able to secure a separation of Western Electric from A. T. &; T. and the Bell Laboratories , either entity would have lacked ample resources for independent research . Had such a separation occurred and independent research organizations been established , it seems Bastian In The San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position to give effective competition to R. C. A. and Westinghouse in many electronic fields . Interjection of independent rivalry in these fields could not but have been of benefit to the public . Mr. Slichter also holds that the current wave of industrial mergers has not weakened industrial rivalry . On the contrary , he is of the opinion that mergers have strengthened competition . His views are not shared by most of the Government officials who have had occasion to examine this problem . Mr. Slichter expresses concern over the Supreme Court 's ruling in the duPont case . It must be borne in mind , however , that the court there found : .. that duPont purposely employed its stock to pry open the General Motors market to entrench itself as the primary supplier of General Motors ' requirements for automotive finishes and fabrics . " And , particularly , the Court further found : " The fire that was kindled in 1917 continues to smolder . It burned briskly to forge the ties that bind the General Motors market to duPont , and if it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past performance , is likely at any time to blaze and make the fusion complete . " Surely , if any effect at all is to be given to the policy for competition expressed in our antitrust laws , combinations of the magnitude involved in General Motors-duPont must be reached and stricken down . There should be no relaxation in our antitrust laws which would enable such combinations to be consummated legally . EMANUEL CELLED . Washington , D. C. Mr. Celler , a Member of Congress ( D. , N.
