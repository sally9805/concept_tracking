txt The House Ways and Means Committee yesterday agreed to put off action on President Eisenhower 's request for extension of present corporate and excise tax rates until after it finishes work on a billion dollar technical tax revision bill . However , Chairman Reed ( R. , N. Y. ) emphasized that the committee would get around to considering corporate and excise taxes in time for Congress to act before April 1 . when these rates are scheduled to drop under present law . The committee made this decision on procedure as it started executive session voting on the revision bill . The major change agreed on by the committee in its first session was a provision giving persons who qualify as heads of families the full benefits which married couples now get from income splitting . The head-of-family provision is available to single , widowed , divorced or separated persons who support a close relative . Under present law these taxpayers get only half the benefit that married couples get from income splitting . The change agreed on by the committee would put the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple . Los . Put at $50 Mill ' Committee officials said the change would mean a S50 million a year loss for the Treasury . The $50 million tax relief will go to some 700,000 taxpayers who now take the head-of-family tax treatment . In order to get benefit from this ti eatmerit. the taxi ayer 's income must exceed $3,555.56 and the tax benefit increases as the taxpayer 's income goes up . A single person who qualifies as head of a family and makes $1,000 a year would save $S ft orn the change . If he makes $6,000 his tax cut would he $36 , and if he makes i ' 8,000 his cut would he $92 At the same time the committee approved larger tax benefits for heads of families , it also changed somewhat the standards for determining taxpayer eligibility for this treatment . In one important respect , it relaxed the present standards . Under present law , a taxpayer has to support a close relative in the taxpayer 's own household in order to qualify for head-of-family treatment . The committee eliminated this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available even if the supported relative lives in his own house rather than in the taxpayer 's Two other changes , however , tightened the standards . One change requires that the taxpaver actually must provide more than half the cost of taking care of a child before the taxpayer can call himself the head of a family . At present . a taxpayer automatically gets the head of family treatment for a child no matter what percentage of the child 's living expenses lie contributes Moreover . under the committee bill the classes of dependents which can make the taxpayer eligible for head-of-family status are limited to the taxpayer 's son , daughter , father , mother , brother and sister . At present the taxpayer also ' could claim head of family treatment for a stepson , stepdaughter , mother-in-law or father-in-law . Under the committee bill these relations could be included only if the taxpayer 's wife has died and he was not legally separated from her at the time of her death or if he has not remarried since her death . The committee also voted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren , grandparents , nephews , nieces aunts , uncles . sons in law and daughters in law . At present the head of household treatment can be claimed by taxpayers suppotting such relations . Moreover , if a taxpayer 's , spouse is not dead , he can be classified as a head of family only if he is legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance . The changes in the head of family provision would be effective under the committee bill as of January 1 , 1954 . Two other committee actions were these : The committee approved a general rearrangement of the existing provisions of the Internal Revenue code . This rearrangement renumbers sections in a more logical sequence , removes archaic language , adds cross references to related provisions and sets up a summary at the beginning of each part of the code as to the provisions contained in that pat . Committee officials told reporters the members had stiaightened out the procedure as their first order of business and had agreed " not to consider tax rate questions such as excise and corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revision bill . " They said that Mr. Reed had emphasized that this decision made it essential for the committee to work quickly on the revision bill so that it could move to the other matters in time for Congress to decide one w'ay or the other on the April 1 tax cuts . On that date the corporate tax rate is scheduled to ( - bop from 52 ' . to 47r , ; " and lower excise rates are scheduled for liquor , tobacco , gasoline , autos and sporting goods . President Eisenhowei asked Congress to extend the present rates for another year Mr. Reed emphasized that the procedure agreed on by the committee was " for the sole purpose of speeding work on the revision bill and not to delay action on the other tax iates until it was too late for Congress to act " The executive sessions on the revision bill are expected to last at least a month or six weeks , making it late February before the Ways and Means Committee could get to the excise and corporate rate question . Committee officials said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be dragging on for too long , for the committee to lay it aside and take iin the Anril l rates , or to work on the two bills concurrently .
