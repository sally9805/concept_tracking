A crucial point in the current debate about Asia is what to do about reluctant allies-give in to them , try to win them over , or if need be , go it alone . Last week , in a commencement speech at Georgetown University , Ambassador Warren Austin , U.S. Representative to the U.N. , and a Republican , made the case for allies . Excerpts : <P> SOME say our strategic frontier lies along an island chain , or on a river 's bank . I say our strategic frontier lies where aggression threatens liberty . <P> We have not the capability of imposing a pax Americana upon the world . More important , we have not the desire . Our motive is neither to impose our will upon the world , nor to turn our backs upon it and retreat to our own frontiers . Either course would be folly . Either course would strip us of friends and allies at the moment in American history when , more than any other , we need friends and allies . Our aim is to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this . Nearly twice as many people inhabit non-Soviet Europe as inhabit the United States ; and they can produce nearly as much steel a year as we can . Quite aside from any considerations of the human spirit , these are adequate reasons for us to hold to our aim of strengthening the free world and keeping it big . <P> We deliberately chose the United Nations way . By another act of choice , we could choose to go it alone . But we 'd better count the cost , and choose with our eyes open , not in a blindness of irritation because not every country in the free world always agrees with every one of our policies . Countries do differ , as men and women sometimes do . Differences do not mean divorce , when the great ends of policy are still held in common . <P> We are now in the pioneer days of collective security . In Korea , we are testing a theory : that aggression by a great power can be met locally without expanding into general war . This theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the experience of the 1930s , which seemed to teach men that they had better use the courage to fight local wars so that they would not have to fight world wars . We can not , of course , control the acts of aggressors . Let us make sure that history keeps the blame on them for acts which would turn a limited war into a general war .
