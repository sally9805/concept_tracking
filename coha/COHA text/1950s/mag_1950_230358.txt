Radio 's four major networks were beginning to take serious notice last week of a bustling new rival . Sparked by energetic , moonfaced President Gordon McLendon , Liberty Broadcasting System has grown in the past three years from one station in Texas to 240 in 34 states by concentrating on a single specialty : bringing broadcasts of major-league baseball games to the vast audience beyond the reach of stations in the major-league cities . <P> Sports-minded Gordon McLendon first got the idea for his network during the war , when he found that boys from Arkansas argued just as hotly as Brooklynites about big-league baseball , even though the only games they ever heard were the World Series . After he got out of the Navy he started Dallas ' station KLIF , began broadcasting from teletyped play-by-play accounts flashed to him from a Manhattan office . Under fire at first from minor-league owners , McLendon soon convinced them that his broadcasts ( and constant plugging of minor-league clubs ) were helping to fill local ballparks by whipping up baseball interest . When other stations in Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasts , his network got under way . <P> A crack announcer as well as a fast-stepping businessman , McLendon still depends on teletyped reports , dressing them up with skillful sound effects and a sense of on-the-spot excitement that has given him bigger audiences in some cities than competing " live " broadcasts direct from the press box . Explains McLendon : " I 'm not trying to deceive anybody . I 'm only trying to give them a colorful broadcast . " <P> Though only 29 , McLendon refers to himself as " the old Scotchman " and , on the air , makes himself out to be a contemporary of octogenarian Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics . Admiring fans send him gifts they think appropriate to his years , including a set of false teeth which he uses as a paperweight . <P> This fall , McLendon expects to add 60 new stations to the network , and to hold his audience with Ted Husing 's broadcasts of Army football games . For hours when there are no sports to broadcast , Liberty has already started a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sport , in which McLendon will re-create such highlights of the past as the Demp-sey-Firpo fight and the spectacular games of Notre Dame 's Four Horsemen . <P> In Los Angeles , another network , scheduled to go into operation in November , was preparing to enter the field . Progressive Broadcasting System hoped to perk up many of the 1,000. slowly expiring small unaffiliated stations of the U.S. with a daily infusion of ten hours of " live " and recorded shows . Hoping for a network of 350 stations ( and needing 200 to break even ) , Progressive promised a familiar formula : soap operas , Hollywood gossip , a homespun philosopher named Cottonseed Clark , and such singers as Mel Torme and Connie Haines .
