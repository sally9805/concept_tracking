A Story by Mary Lee Settle The Old Wives ' Tale Drawings by Shirley Burke I M E T Mrs. Hartner on the Queen Elizabeth in dune of 1950 . She lay in a deck chair , tucked under a blue and red Cunard rug , staring with ice eyes back at the terrible Atlantic . From what I could see of her , she was dressed for her age as formally as in a uniform  --  a gray felt hat , gray suit , a delicate blouse . She wore Roger and Gallet 's violet perfume . Her hands shook from the weight of her book , which was a new novel I recognized , crowned with a gold Cunard seal , and from the jigging of the morning sea . You are supposed not to remember scents . This is not true . You smell them again as you hear music , voices after they are gone ; the scent of violet charms this room I write in , and rose toward me when I passed the deck space this September where she had sat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book with a snap , and rolling her gray head toward me with a slight sigh , annoyed and full of knowledge . She judged my clothes , my face , without hiding what she was doing , a little bored , thendecided to talk to me , interrupting my reading without apology . " You know I read these books . " She tapped at the crown which lay toward the sun , in her lap . " Sometimes I wonder . . . all this concern about identity . My mother always said ' Jenny , remember who you are . ' It seemed so simple  --  most of the time . " She waited for me to speak , then seemed to understand that I was rousing too slowly from my book . " Girl talk , " she said , after a little while . With her accent she almost said " gull talk " and I remembered wrongly , out of place , the heady eyes , close yellow beaks . She was not like that . She laughed away the words , then was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , between the Anglicans and the Episcopal Church , you 'd better have a talk  --  you 'd better , before you slip back into place . My father always said you had a place , like a sword in a scabbard  --  outside it you were every bit as dangerous . " She said this to the sea , which was now throwing sparkles back up toward the sun , magnificently self-centered . I put my book away . So we began , recalling , although she did n't know it , and I doubt she could still at her age afford to care , my perpetual homesickness ; acquaintances in common , the mountains , the incredible green lushness , slow-moving deep rivers , limestone jutting out in the high valleys . All this rose and blotted out the moody Atlantic , grew and leafed , hummed in my head . But the talk was , of course , about people . " My uncle told me . . . " " My grandfather always said . . . " We exchanged platitudes quietly . We did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The nicest young man came to see me when I was visiting my cousins once . At least I thought he was nice . Just as smart as he could be . But my aunt soon let me know . " Her mouth made a small " oh . " " She let me know all right . She said : ' I wish you would n't bring that young man around any more , jenny ! ' I tended to argue , you know how you do . She admitted he had nice manners and that lie had n't done anything wrong . To tell you the truth , he talks topics , ' my aunt told me . " We both laughed . " Poor little old thing , " she said , now to the ocean . " He finished fairly high up- in the State Department . " I tried to judge her age . Later , from what she told me , I guessed it was seventy-three or - four , but she looked older . She must have been ill , or she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth in one gesture . She was dry and brittle , grown , harvested , this woman , with a touch of the self-centered objectivity of the very old , or the sea she looked back at as an equal . Intuitively a woman can tell with a woman when a relationship is moving toward confidence , just as she can tell with a man , when he is going to move toward attraction . All women except the traitors are witches ; beware of them ; all women , I said , except the traitors , and they are that because they are afraid . 0 N THE third morning , with the sea beginning to flatten in that gray-green spread that foretells the western shore , to my intense relief , she began at last to talk to me beyond the safe statements of her society , about herself , folding and smoothing the Cunard nig under her arthritic fingers . She began with a question . " I wonder . You know when we met , I was reading some book . . . Ca n't remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then suddenly , turtle-snapping : " How long have you been married ? " " Nine years . " Our heads were close together , and our eyes ; the wind was so high it would otherwise have torn the words , without sound , away from us . " Happy ? " I began to be a little afraid . . . the water under ice , beyond judgment observing . . . " I see you are , " she said . " Oh Lord , I see you are , child . " Suddenly a tear slipped from under her ice-eyes , and she fumbled for her handkerchief . " This wind is terrible , " she said , and turned away for a lull two minutes . " People think , " she said at last , " that after the ripening of a happy marriage . . . that 's what it is. ripening , " she told me , and I nodded , my hair stinging my own eyes so I could see her in snatches . . . . that that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain people say is in the Bible . Them as has gits . And there 's no woman more apt than a happy one who thinks she 's secure to collect love like a magnet . One day , she 'll take on a great weight of it , and Lord , shell sink . . . down , down . . . Oh dear God . . . " Mrs. Hartner was watching the ocean , and I knew she was waiting to let what she had to say come nearer , stop being " a woman , " " one , " " you " and draw to her , become " T. " " I " she could say , at last . " I was reared all over Virginia sometimes with aunts , because Father was a preacher , and you know how you move . He and Mother never had a dime but every time they moved , five thousand books went , too . Father always said , ' Thank God , my parishioners do n't look inside that solid brown leather . They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classical scholar . . The Episcopal Church suited him , and it suited Mother , who I remember as reading until things just fell around her . They just read , and floated on the surface without a dime , and let me and my four brothers run wild . I took to books and my brothers raised Cain all over the place . Those two ways of discovery have more in common than you can imagine . " I wondered later if my mother had ever had . what I found out . She must have . Everybody must have . You know what maudlin means ? It 's the way they used to pronounce Mary Magdalen 's name . Oh , do n't worry , I 'm not going to talk about sin . Do n't believe in it anymore . Just about emotion . A lot of people think that 's worse . Maudlin . Tacky . " We were brought beef tea , and the interruption seemed to make her mind jump a gap . When the steward finally left she began again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh yes I do . You ... I 'll never forget a minute of the day of my marriage . In those days we had a real feeling of the end and the beginning . It was drummed into us . I was so scared . Women told more wives ' tales about your wedding night then than about your confinement . They scared you about that later . One of my cousins with a voice like a hungry chicken was the worst and everybody knew her husband ran around like anything . She kept looking at me and shaking her silly head . She was a lot older than me . I never quite forgave her for saying I cheated my grandmother about the fairies when I was a child . Is n't it funny how you remember silly things for just ever . . . Never get them out of your mind . " Of course Tenny Hartner was the beginning all right . His name was Tennyson but everybody called him Tenny . When I say he was the finest man I ever kneW , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . That is n't true . We had  --  oh  --  what makes people start looking alike ; become like twins in their minds . . . almost not have to say things . ' ' She shied away again from herself and looked at me and smiled . " You remember when Queen Caroline died , George , who loved her so , but Lord knows he was grumpy enough to her  --  he said in his grief : ' I 'll never have a wife again , only mistresses . ' Everybody thinks that 's funny . I find it the saddest thing . " Still we were both smiling . Of course , Tenny was a lot like my father  --  a passionate scholar . It 's so private , light , familiar , is n't it ? " I did n't catch the mischief , and agreed . Her eyes glittered , as the sea had glittered earlier . " I could tell you things . . . " The sound of her voice was cold . She closed her eyes and let the scenes form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her face smoothing as she talked , growing beautiful for a little while . " Part of it . . a great deal of it , " she said , " is downright funny . I can always tell those unaware and floating women , little john boats in an inlet , that this will happen to . I was over forty and still pretty good-looking . " T HE ELDEST girl would have been eighteen ; two boys fifteen and fourteen ; a late girl , six . 1 already knew them , their careers , their children . All those things about herself she told me Icing before this . " It was somebody I had known all my life . That was the funny part . A friend of my oldest brother 's . I 'm not going to tell you his circumstances . They do n't matter . It happened at my mother 's  --  at a Sunday school picnic . I 'm telling you this so you 'll be warned . Women have got to warn each other . Ahr She almost said a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic . She used to make everybody in the town help . I was helping , and all those young girls flitting around . I 'd forgotten for the whole day what I looked like . I was leaning across the trestle-table. under the trees , where the sunlight spotted and shook on the white cloth . I was putting down a big plate of salad . I still remember ; so cool-looking in my hot , summer arms , I thought to myself , Oh Lord , I 'd like to be lying in that lettuce , curled around one of the tomatoes , naked as a slug . They used to call tomatoes love-apples . There was n't a Methodist of my parents ' generation who 'd touch one . They thought they were poison . I do n't think many Episcopalians would , either . " " Then , all of a sudden , there were somebody 's hands on the other side of the platter . We held it between us . I knew who it was with a rush before I looked up , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't dare to look at a man . Poor thing , he 'd just been passing by , and offered to help , by instinct . We just stood there holding that plate like a couple of fools , When I had to look at him , my voice would n't act right . But I said : ' That 's mother 's best platter . I do n't know why she brings it on picnics , ' just talking like a fool , a born fool . And I freed myself from the platter , and wiped the warm hair off my forehead , staring because I could n't stop . He said : ' My God , Jenny , what 's happened ? ' as if that whole silly picnic had been struck still by some gong of heat and sun , and drew me down the narrow table , over all that fried chicken and cake and deviled eggs , till we got to the end of it , and then we just flowed together , and walked out toward the woods , not daring to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us any attention at all  --  just two old friends , one wiping her hands on her apron , and still smoothing the damp bits of hair with a nervous hand . " I saw for a second the hand in her lap , quiet now with age , its tremors of its own accord , not to wipe her hot forehead , a woman full of love , who could n't wait to be touched . Now it lay moving slightly , a chalk crab . She was saying : " Him tall and slim and cool-looking , handsome and courteous , like men used to look at picnics while the women worked like dogs . He had what we used to call dash . Rut tell you one thing about him . He 's the only man I 've ever known that I never heard an unkind word about . " Well , we went on out in the woods , farther and farther , shaking , and then we kissed each other , at first barely touching , surprised , then harder , harder , like two creeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and she dabbed the deep creases from her lip corners , where the spittle gathered . " Child , I do n't apologize when I say we did n't consider . Of course we did n't consider . You see , this kind of love , this late love " ? she had n't used the word before . Now she had gotten near enough to say it ? " is very pure , even if it is as heavy as dying , and Lord knows it 's out beyond flirtation , or even desire , as you might think of desire . It 's detached , a complete thing all in itself , and it has n't anything to do with circumstances or other people . These poor little old girls who feel flickers 0 ; desire and think they have to run get a divorce . Poor little old na  --  ve things . " SHE WAS still for so long that I thought she had fallen asleep , and I watched the impersonal sea . " You have something like it when you 're young  --  adolescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love-body , and everybody you know is yearning and it 's all expected pain  --  taken for granted . It 's late you find out how incredible it is  --  when it happens to you when you think you 're old and balanced . Lord , it 's so heavy you do n't think you can carry it and completer , some way , because you have knowledge of what it can mean . You know then . " I had to go home the next day . " When she heard the sound I made she turned , arguing , after that long a time . " Well , I could n't hang around Covington the whole summer . I 'd left half my family in Richmond and I had to get back . You have to get back , " she almost snapped . Then , calmly , " I forgot to tell you . Tenny practiced law in Richmond . He was a fine lawyer . " She added delicately , " There was always money there , but that did n't stop Tenny . He loved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time she stopped talking I thought she had finished , not the story she had to tell but how much she would let herself . say , out there on the scrubbed deck , a thousand miles from the scabbard . I wondered when she 'd whisper to herself , " Jenny , you 're talking like a born fool . " But at last . . . " The next time I saw him it was the hottest day that I can remember in Richmond . 1 had just turned in the door of Thalhimers , there , out of the sun . They have awfully nice things . It was blinding in the shadow after that sun . His hand was on my arm , and I knew by his outline and his voice before my eyes could clear . I ought to . I 'd been thinking about him for two years . ' jenny , I 'm glad to see you . ' That 's what he said . Not very romantic , is it ? " He offered to drive me home . I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat for , I ca n't remember after all these years , but I can remember he drove a Chandler sedan . It smelt of dogs . He 'd brought a dog down to school , then just come on in to Richmond because he said he could n't do anything else . But lie was n't going to come to see me . He said he did n't plan that . " Well , we just drove around shady streets . It was cool in the car . About fifteen miles an hour . We just drove . You see , it  --  the thing  --  had grown in both of us . We were familiar , not shy ; we just drove and talked . We tried to plan but we could n't . The minute we did it sounded ugly , trashy . But I knew I was going to go and meet him . I knew that all the time . " All we wanted to do was to wake up together in the morning  --  once . just once . It sounds so silly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just once . " She spoke to me as if I were the censor of the world . She seemed to beg . But what could I say ? " ' When I got home , I remember I got out of the car quick , not looking back . Did I tell you it was a Chandler sedan ? I stopped in the hall in front of the mirror and tried to take off my hat . Somehow the wind had tangled strands of my hair around the hat pins . My hands were shaking . I was ready to cry . Then Tenny came out from the library and tried to help me . I had on two of what they used to call ormolu pins  --  black and gold . One of my cousins had brought them from Paris . There was my summer leghorn and hair and pins , all tangled . But Tenny loosened it all , so gently , and watched Inc in the mirror . " He said : ' I 'll have to take your hair down . ' And he started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall table , down where the flowers had already begun to drop their petals from the heat . Loosened it all , and my hair fell down around me like a shawl . My leg-horn rolled across the floor and I began to cry . You know , in those days I could sit on my hair . It was chestnut . I never used a thing on it . Except a little Golden Glint , " she added , confessing . I looked to where the wind tugged at one short blue-gray curl , like a spring , tugged and whipped . She still looked out to sea , and not to me . " Tenny took me upstairs and lay me down and just sat there for a long time stroking my forehead with a cold washrag . He kept saying ' Darlin ' , ' in a surprised way , ' never mind . Never mind , darlin ' . ' I think he knew . I think he un-derstood . I 've always thought something like it must have happened to him . " Then suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered who it was . " When Loda came to call us to dinner , I heard him at the door tell her to send mine up . He said I had a sick headache . " She laughed . ' lord , I wonder how many secrets in the South go by the name of sick head-ache ? " " Then the joke began . After all the decision , I could n't go . " I so waited for her to explain that she had to tell me , shyly . " I was unwell . Something brought it early . What a woman 's joke ... I had to send a telegram . It looked so cold . All capital letters on a yellow pad . The day I should have been there my chicken-voiced cousin called me on the telephone and started to fuss at me because she said it was my turn to put flowers on the altar and I 'd forgotten . She said I had a mind like asieve and it was my mother coming out in me . I could n't get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sobbing away like a girl . I could n't hang up and be rude . She said she was only teasing and I never had any sense of humor . Finally I told her I was n't well . She had n't hung up five minutes when the telephone rang again . She 'd called my sister-in-law who wanted to know if there was anything she could do . Then it started . I suppose that 's the way life went on all the time but I never noticed it so much until that day . I had nineteen close relatives in Richmond alone . " Finally I told Loda to answer the thing and I locked myself in my room . The last thing I heard was Loda hollering into the mouthpiece , ' Mir Hamlet . cai n't tawlk , she got a sick headache . ' Loda was always scared the telephone was going to bite her . " Well , I wrote , I could n't help it . . . a little incomplete letter , and promised again the second time . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper the next morning at the breakfast table . The whole mine field had come out on strike . .1 knew it was n't any use . Him right in the middle of it . He wrote to me then . I got it a few days later . I hid it from Tenny . Did n't tell him who it was from and he did n't ask , just held my head after breakfast and said , ' Do n't worry about anything , darlin ' , do n't worry about a thing ' . He had a big case on , so he might have meant that . " I kept saying to myself all the week in the still heat , The third time 's a charm . The third time 's a charm . The children were at Virginia Beach so I had the whole house to wander around in , neglecting things . " I RODE the train to Prince  --  Prince , West Virginia . That 's where he told me . It was so hot on that train I thought I 'd die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " Tell me about the trip ... " " The trip ? I just sat there coming into Prince and cried . You remember Persephone ? I 'm sure she cried all the way to hell , wanting to go so much at the same time . You ca n't tell me that girl did n't eat those seeds so she 'd have to go hack . After all it is n't every girl gets swept off her feet like that . I always thought that part of the story meant she was pregnant ; like those marriages they try to annul but it 's too late . The girl 's seen to that . " " The air outside that train window was turning yellow , so still that not a leaf stirred . Some-where up in the day coach I remember a baby crying and crying , far away . The calm was awful , like a great holding of breath . I kept saying , ' Oh Lord , do n't let it storm ' til 1 get there . Do n't let it , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got into Prince , just a junction , hardly a town at all . He had a taxicab waiting for me . I was to go to the ferry in that and meet him on the other side . He thought that was better . It was , honestly , the only deception we practiced , outside of me saying nothing about the letter . " The storm could n't wait . It could n't wait that long . The first huge rain drops splattered against the windshield about a mile from the ferry . Then the wind hollered down the valley . It shook that old taxicab like a ship at sea . We bumped and wallowed through a narrow road that seemed to run with wild water . The driver had buttoned those black flaps up they used to have , and the only way to see out was those little yellow celluloid squares , pouring with water . Water beat on the canvas top with a racket that threatened to break it , and seeped in the edges of the flaps . " The driver kept saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no river , ma'am . ' But I told him to go on because I did n't believe God would play such a trick . " Well , we got to the river . " It seemed to rush at us , half-way up the ferry road already . Down there , through the windshield , I could see the ferry , twisting and whirling in the light brown water , one rope already gone , deserted . There was n't a soul around . I started to get out of the car , but the driver said , ' Lady , it ai n't no use . ' But I stumbled on and called out over the wind , ' Let me look , let me look anyway . Wait for me and let me just look . ' " I had n't been out of that car a minute before my clothes were plastered to me , and the wind had torn my hair half down and I had lost my hat . I got down as near as I could to the water , but not too near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the ferry . As I came down the ferry broke away , light as a cork , and was flung down river . " Then through all that rain and wind I saw him on the other side and he saw me . Neither of us even waved . What was the use ? He just stood there like some mute Dante who would never write a line , just ship coal and dream ; and me a middle-aged plump little Beatrice , soaked and bedraggled , with her hair halfdown , who knew when she was whipped . " The story was over . This old woman , who told it , exhausted . But in one last flicker she said : " That was the last joke on us  --  the cosmic joke . I realized , coming hack in the taxicab in a pool of water , that we were God 's playthings , and I swore I 'd never let myself be that again , be blown about for a caprice like a plaything . I told Him so . I just told Him so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living with God all my life and I knew better than to try again . A N D N 0 W you 'll want you get over it or not . fool . Love is n't something you begin and end like a book . You love forever if it 's what I 've learned to call love , and you do n't have a certain amount to give , first one person and then another . It grows on you . It just grows , that 's all . " She got up and threw her rug down and went away without another word , stumping angrily down the deck , holding onto the ship 's rail in the wind , a little thin stooped gray back . When I missed her in the afternoon , and again the next morning , I went to her cabin and , knocked . There was no answer . Her . stewardess told me Mrs. Rattner had a sick , headache and did n't want to be disturbed . I never saw her again . On this trip home my cousin told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
