THE resurrection of buried literary works is not without its dangers . Anything George Orwell wrote is worth reprinting , and we can all give two cheers for the American edition of " Homage to Catalonia , " which was first published in England in 1938 . The danger in this con case is that Orwell was writing in a white heat about a . incident fused , unimportant , and obscure ncident in the Spanish Civil War . There are fewer people in the United States today who know about it than can work out Einstein 's theory of relativity . Proof of this can be found in Lionel Trilling 's introduction to the book . Orwell has become a minor classic , and his experience in Catalonia was a turning point in his life . Without it , we would not have had " Animal Farm " and " 1984 , " Moreover , the Spanish Civil War , whatever one 's sympathies , holds a major place in our hectic century . It was the rehearsal for World War II , and because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War has been twisted into a monstrous caricature of fascism versus communism . Trilling 's error  --  and other critics have fallen into it , too  --  was to take Orwell literally and uncritically ; to assume that because Orwell was in one corner of Spain for a small part of the war he must have known everything about it , and that his story of the betrayal of the social revolution by the Communists must have been true . Orwell 's book is being used today as a club to beat those who had other ideas about the war and those who did their best to describe it while it was taking place . This is a pity , for " Homage to Catalonia " is an honest , vivid , personal account of one man 's bitter experience in the Spanish Civil War . If people read it for its literary value , they will have a rewarding experience . If they read it as history , they will be either misled or confused . Orwell went to Spain thoroughly ignorant of politics ; he came away still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that communism is a counterrevolutionary movement . Unfortunately for today 's readers , he reached this valid conclusion from false premises . Orwell was a volunteer with a Loyalist militia outfit from December , 1936 , to May , 1937 . He spent all his time either on the Aragon front or in Barcelona ; so he was restricted to a small group of men in a small part of Spain during five months of a war that lasted thirtyHERBERT L. AIATTHEWS is the distinguished fen eign correspondent and editorial writer of the New York Times . December 27 , 1952 two months . In the end he was severely wounded , pursued by the police , and barely succeeded in fleeing to France . At all times he was wonderfully brave , and as patient , decent , honest , - and fair-minded as a human being could be . What happened is that Orwell got caught up in the partisan politics of Loyalist Spain . " When I came to Spain , " he wrote , " and for some time afterwards , I was not only uninterested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew there was a war on , but I had no notion what kind of war . . . ? I knew that I was serving in something called the P. 0 . U. M. ( I had only joined the P. 0 . U. M. militia rather than any other because I happened to arrive in Barcelona with I. L. P. papers ) , but I did not realize that there were serious differences between the political parties . " The result was tragic for Orwell . He was a passionate rebel at heart who was convinced victory could be attained only by a working-class revolution against feudalism , reaction , and conservatism . In fact , it was a civil war with profound and explosive international ramifications ; he , wanted to fight it as an internal class struggle . From the beginning Orwell was doomed , and anyone who knew what was at stake and what problems were involved could have told him so the day he appeared in Barcelona . The Partido Obrero de , UnificaciOn Marxista ( P. 0 . U. M. ) was more complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit , but it was also dissident , fractional purist-Socialist , mixed up with dissident Anarchists , with Trotskyists and dissident Trotskyists , with ex-Communists and an agglomeration of non-affiliates , men who sought revolution or adventure or merely a haven at a time when it was dangerous not to belong to some leftist or trade-union political movement . The other parties were all very choosy about members ; the P. 0 . U. M. was not ? which was why it attracted many foreigners ? Germans , Belgians , and English  --  who were in Catalonia when the war began or who came in later . The P. 0 . U. M. was also , paradoxically , the most pedantically Marxist of all the Spanish revolutionary parties . Orwell did not realize it , but the P. 0 . U. M. was already on the downhill path when he joined the militia , and the disintegration had gone very far by the time of the May , 1937 , uprising in Barcelona . It had relatively few members , little trade-union influence , and no more than 7,000 or 8,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catalonia was between the two great left movements ? the Communist-dominated Partido Socialista Unificado de Catalunya ( 13 : S. U. C. ) and the Anarchist ConfederaciOn . Nacional de Trabajadores ( C. N. T. ) . The P. 0 . U. M. was caught in the struggle and smashed . A few weeks before Orwell arrived in Barcelona the P. 0 . U. M. had been ejected from the government ( December 19 , 1936 ) . At that time its leaders baldly stated : " You can not govern without the P. 0 . U. M. and you can not govern against the P. 0 . U. M. " Then they set out to try to prove it . Orwell put the P. 0 . U. M. program into one sentence  --  and thereby inadvertently condemned it : " The war and the revolution are inseparable . " The fact was that the war  --  that is victory in the war  --  and the revolution were incompatible . The Loyalists were losing the war because of the revolution . The great popular uprisings of the early months  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big landholdings , the occupation of factories , the camaraderie , the heroism  --  all these things had saved the republic . However , by the time Orwell reached Barcelona the vital need was for unity , discipline , and efficiency . Franco was winning , partly because of German and Italian help ; but also because the Rebels , as they were called then , had a unified command . The Loyalists were faced with the necessity of organizing a centralized administration and command or losing the war quickly . Meanwhile , in September and October , 1936 , Stalin began to send arms to Spain . This immediately put the Spanish Communist Party in the ascendancy . The Russians naturally channeled their aid through the Communists , who used their advantage to strengthen their own movement . To Orwell this was a tragedy , because they were Communists and because they were out for themselves . To Spain it happened to be an advantage , because the Communists were the best soldiers , the best administrators , and  --  this was a paramount consideration ? because they were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward , if at all . There was iao use saying then , or now , that they were wrong because their motives were crooked and their final aims were evil . " The thing for which the Communists were working , " Orwell wrote , " was not to postpone the Spanish revolution till a more suitable time but to make sure that it never happened . " Which did not altei the fact that Communist tactics were probably right during the war . Orwell felt the power of the Communists but never grasped the fact that the government was not run or controlled by Communists . He learned that after he wrote this book . If he had stayed in Spain long enough to see Stalin pulling up his stakes and slacking off on his aid , he would have noted the weakening of the Spanish Communist Party and the strengthening of the Republicans and Socialists . It was my opinion  --  and many observers shared it  --  that Spain never would have gone Communist if the Loyalists had won the war . There was sound basis for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recoanize the episodic character of Orwell 's book . T HE blow was struck in the uprising of May 5-7 , 1937 , in Barcelona . Here , again , the complications were extraordinary . The Valencia government had to get control of Catalonia and bring the Anarchists into line . The P. 0 . U. M. was numerically small and ideologically insignificant and it was not Anarchist , but it was revolutionary and was believed by the government to contain traitorous elements working for Franco and even for Germany and Italy . The fighting began as a quarrel arising from a misunderstanding between the central ' authorities and the Anarchists . The powerful Communist P. S. U. C. immediately jumped to the government side , and the puny P. ' 0 . U. M. got itself involved on the Anarchist side . Within three days at least four hundred and perhaps twice that many people were killed , which made it one of the most sanguinary cases of street fighting , in history . It ended when the government sent in detachments of soldiers to restore and maintain order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever knew in detail what happened or why it happened . A Orwell spent the whole time on the roof of P. 0 . U. M. headquarters in the Hotel Falcon waiting to be attacked ; he never fired a shot in earnest , nor was he shot at . He got his information on what happened later from his P. 0 . U. M. friends and  --  being as always painfully honest  --  from whatever other sources he could . But the book adds nothing to what was known . The account furnished by the government side was just as detailed and more authoritative and plausible . The suppression of the P. 0 . U. M. afterward was not a pure Communist plot , as Orwell supposed . It had the support of the U. G. T. ? the major Socialist labor organization of Spain  --  as well as of the government authorities , who were not under Communist domination . In fact , the P. 0 . U. M. found no friends in its agony  --  which was significant . There is no better explanation of the outcome than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Barcelona fighting had given the ? Valencia government the long-wanted excuse to assume fuller control of Catalonia . " For the first time in five months Orwell saw the Spanish Republican flag ! Orwell had recognized from the beginning that , although he did not understand or like everything he saw , it was " a state of affairs worth fighting for . " And he never regretted having fought for it , in spite of what happened to him . Spain worked its magic on Orwell , as it did on all of us . He caught the greatness of that time and he has imprisoned it in these pages . Yet the introducer and most of the critics missed it , missed the forest for some grubby trees that came at the end of the journey . Spain did- not live up to the hopes , the The NATION desires , the ideals , the ( alas ! ) illusions that all , Orwell included , harbored . There is no denying that he , personally ; had the , greatest possible provocation . Horrible injustices were committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew suffered from them . That is why this book is one of the most damning to have been written and printed about the Loyalists . It is also a reason for its value as a historical document , and it therefore becomes especially necessary to balance it truly , place it where it belongs . Yet , at the very end , Orwell could write from outside : It sounds like lunacy , but the thing that both of us wanted this wife was with him was to be back in Spain . . . . Curiously enough , the whole experience has left me with not less but more belief in the decency of human beings . And I hope the account I have given is not too misleading . . . . In case I have not said this somewhere earlier in the book I will say it now : beware of my partisanship , my mistakes of fact and the distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events . And beware of exactly the same things when you read any other book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add a postscript to all this , for I have not seen any evidence that Professor Trilling or the critics knew that Orwell became acquainted with some of the Spanish Republican exiles in London in the early years of World War II . After finishing this article , I wrote to Dr. Juan Negrin , the last Premier of Republican Spain , asking him to tell me what he remembered about Orwell . I give here the pertinent extracts from Dr. Negrin 's Leply , which he is kindly letting me quote . As far as I recollect , I first met Orwell some time after August or September , 1940 . He was presented to me as an editorialist of the Observer , and I was told that he had been in Spain during our war . I did not catch that he had been there , not as a reporter or writer , but as a volunteer in a fighting unit , and I believe I was not aware of that circumstance till I read his book on Catalonia , months after his death . After we got acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that a reciprocal current of esteem , sympathy , and even friendship was established . . . . Spain was often a matter of conversation , generally in connection with the daily developments of the World War , and occasionally recalling bygone episodes of our civil strife . I remember now that when this point was touched , he was very eager to inquire about the policy , internal and external , of the government I headed , the changes in the line of conduct of the war which I introduced , our problems and difficulties , the many mistakes I later realized to have committed , which I frankly confessed to him ; though some of them were unavoidable and would have had to be repeated , once more , even after the previous experiences ; our way of handling the motley conglomerate of incompatible December 27 , 1952 parties , labor unions , and dissident groups and also the frequently self-appointed , largely unconstitutional , local and regional " governments " with which.we had to deal ; our foreign policy , especially our relations with Russia , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only great power supporting us internationally and prepared to provide us , on the basis of cash payment  --  we never asked it gratuitously of anyone  --  with the necessary weapons ; the causes of our defeat . . . . I have the impression that Orwell was satisfied with my explanations , given to him without reserve , with all latitude , but strictly confidentially . Unfortunately , at the time his book was unknown to me ; otherwise I would have been doing the questioning . . . . After reading his book , I did not change my opinion about Orwell  --  a decent and righteous gentleman , biased by a too rigid , puritanical frame , gifted with a candor bordering on naivete , highly critical but blindly credulous , morbidly individualistic ( an Englishman ! ) but submitting lazily and without discernment to the atmosphere of the gregarious community in which he voluntarily and instinctively anchors himself , and so supremely honest and self-denying that he would not hesitate to change his mind once he perceived himself to be wrong . . . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a group possibly infiltrated by German agents ( reread what he says about Germans moving freely from one side to the other and what the Nazis officially stated after the war about their activities on our side ) but certainly controlled by elements very allergic , not only to Stalinism ( this was more often than not a pure pretext ) but to anything that meant a united and supreme direction of the struggle under a common discipline . Putting all this together , one gets more than enough to justify the distorted image in Orwell 's mind of the happenings of 1937 in Earcelona.
