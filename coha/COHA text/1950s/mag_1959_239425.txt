The Senate , often in a pinchpenny mood when it comes to appropriations for other branches of Government , can feel quite the opposite when it comes to its own creature comforts . Last week Illinois ' Paul Douglas gently belabored his colleagues with some unanswerable facts about their own housekeeping extravagance . Piled in the corridors of the old Senate Office Building , Douglas reported , are 375 desks , 215 steel filing cabinets , 400 chairs , many other odd pieces of old but usable furniture , all destined for the junk heap . Yet the Senators were ordering $113,000 worth of new equipment . And that $150,000 for new carpeting , requested for no better reason than the fact that Government girls might slip and fall on the tile flooring , struck plain-living Senator Douglas as excessive . He offered to buy the girls rubber heels - from his own pocket . <P> On top of all this , the Senate was asking itself for $4,000,000 to complete the subway ( total cost : $6,349,000 ) to the new Senate Office Building . The subway would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas , who had paced it off-and the Senators needed the exercise . But as usual in such matters , the proposed economies were swept under the carpet , and the Douglas amendments were voted down .
