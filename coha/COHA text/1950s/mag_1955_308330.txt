" Come one , come all , " the big sign read . " Free medical clinic . Open day and night . " Inside the clinic , a former warehouse in a newly liberated village of South Viet Nam , a group of Filipino doctors were performing a Caesarean section on a Vietnamese peasant woman . Their operating table was covered with a G.I. blanket and a strip of white cotton cloth torn from a CARE package ; their patient was secured by wires nailed to the side of the table and lifted above her body by wedges of C-ration cans . Their light consisted of one electric bulb and half a dozen flashlights trained upon the incision by Filipino nurses . One nurse was assigned to keep off the insects that swarmed around the light bulb . Four hours after the operation began , a Vietnamese baby boy was born . <P> This was one of about 100,000 " treatments " given by Filipino doctors since they first came to help the Vietnamese last fall . In a country where the French colonials only got around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headway with insufficient equipment against such diseases as smallpox , malaria and beriberi . Fifty-eight Filipino volunteers-doctors , dentists , nurses and social workers-are doing what they can . " It is an inspiring thing . " said Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in his address to the U.S. last week , " to see the Philippine people , who only lately achieved their own independence , now turning to help the most recent addition to the ranks of the free nations . " <P> Drugs &; Dedication . The idea first came to Oscar J. Arellano , 38 , a Manila architect who witnessed the chaos in Saigon last summer , when hundreds of thousands of refugees fled down from the Communist north . Arellano thought Filipino doctors and nurses might like to help out , so he put it up to the Manila headquarters of the Philippine Junior Chamber of Commerce . " Publicity stunt , " argued some Manila skeptics , but last October the first seven Filipino doctors and three Filipino nurses set out for South Viet Nam . Their average age was 25 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pop . 95,000 ) that the refugees were creating out of the jungle . They won respect with their drugs and their dedication . Yet the best assets of the Filipinos were their own likable dispositions . " The people need laughter , " the Filipinos decided , so they chipped in their savings and gave them parties and dances . <P> Pride &; Appreciation . Back home in Manila , " Operation Brotherhood " increasingly caught the national fancy . " For a long time we Filipinos have been receiving help from others , mostly the United States , " said a Manila librarian . " I think it 's a good thing we 're able to help others now . " The Filipinos began talking of 3,350,000 treatments in 1955 , a training program for more Vietnamese nurses , and village first-aid squads . The International Junior Chamber of Commerce has adopted the project , and Jaycees from other Asian countries want to join in . <P> " This is not just medicine for the body that you offer , but medicine for the spirit , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were alone in Viet Nam . Now we see that we 're not . " Happily , Oscar Arellano responded : " By golly , it 's working ! "
