 | Encouraging Developments in the Treatment of Blue Babies There is a great deal of interest in blue babies now that something can be done for many of them . The term " blue babies " is the popular name for babies born with some malformation of the heart or of the great blood vessels that enter and leave the heart . Not all babies who are blue have congenital heart disease , but the more severe cardiac cases have this feature . The bluish color comes from the fact that only part of the blood passes through the lungs , where it takes up oxygen to deliver to the tissues . Oxygenated blood , or arterial blood , is bright red in color . As it returns to the heart from the lungs , the heart pumps this blood through the arteries to the various organs , where it gives up its oxygen . Venous blood , i.e. , the blood that has given up its oxygen , is much darker in color ; it is still red , but a more bluish red . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then normally pumped through the lungs , where it receives a new load of oxygen and turns bright red again . But when the circulatory passages are abnormal , all the blood does not go through the lungs , and some of the venous blood circulates in the arteries , giving the skin a bluish tint . The Kinds of Blue Babies There are many kinds of malformations of the heart : false passages from one chamber to another , or the narrowing of an opening so that an adequate amount of blood can not get through , or the complete absence of a normal opening . And sometimes the great blood vessels are connected with the wrong chamber of the heart . Babies with the most severe of these malformations can not survive for more than a few days or weeks . 31 Other malformations , less serious , permit survival for a longer time with a varying degree of disability and with a risk of certain complications ; still others are not incapacitating and involve no appreciable risk Surgery Now Possible Until a few years ago , congenital heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in children . There was just nothing a doctor could do about it . Methods for recognizing the exact nature of the malformation were not well developed , and to operate on the heart was all but unthinkable . In order to open the heart , a surgeon had to clamp off the great blood vessels . He then had only minutes in which to work before he had to open them up again , for the brain can not long survive without oxygenated blood . From time to time , a few courageous surgeons attempted this lightning operation , and the late Dr. Elliott Cutler succeeded once in enlarging a constricted valvular opening . But the risk was too great , and this kind of operation was abandoned . The situation today is quite different . A tremendous advance was achieved with the development of an artificial oxygenator , a device that short-circuits the heart and lungs . This machine is a pump that receives . the venous blood , oxygenates it , and returns it to the arterial system . It enables the surgeon to clamp off the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , if he should need to , in repairing the heart . The imperfections of earlier designs have gradually been ironed out , and we now have several models that are being successfully used on children .

Blood vessels are among the few tissues that can be transplanted from one individual to another , and artery banks are being developed in several medical centers MEDICAL pediatricians have taken strides in making possible accurate preoperative diagnosis of children with congenital heart disease . Notable advances in X-ray diagnosis were made through the painstaking work of Dr Helen Taussig of Baltimore , and epochmaking contributions have come from other workers both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is. inserting a flexible tube in an arm vein and gradually passing it up the vein until it enters the heart , was first tried by a German , Forssman , and was perfected by a Frenchman , Andre Cournand , who worked in New York with the collaboration of Dickinson Richards By inserting a tube in various chamberof the patient 's heart , a doctor can measure the blood pressure there , as well as the extent to which the blood in each chamber has been oxygenated . A second technique , angiocardiography , was developed primarily by a Cuban pediatrician , Agustin Castellanos . The procedure consists of injecting radiopaque material ( which is not transparent to the X ray ) into the blood stream or into the heart and taking an X-ray picture some seconds later . A marked improvement in this technique was made by two Scandinavians ? Dr. Lind and Dr. Vigelius , who developed cineradiography a method for taking a moving picture of the fluoroscopic image of the heart after the injection of the radiopaque material .

Pediatric cardiology has come of age . It is a very special subject . The new diagnostic tools are not generally available , the people trained to use them are still few , and the qualified cardiac surgeons are to be found only in the larger medical centers . ' They are , however , increasing in numbers and in skill . The job that seemed impossible a few years ago is being done . We are not yet able to help every kind of patient with cardiac malformation . But if the advances of the last two decades are an indication of the future , we can look forward to a time when the rehabilitation of the cardiac **30;124;TOOLONG will be a reality .
