txt From readers of my recently published recollections I have received many interesting details of the events I narrated and many anecdotes of the actors in those dramas of the news . A hitherto unpublished sidelight on the prosecation of Alexander Jester at New London , Mo. , in 1900 for the mur ? der of Gilbert Gates , elder brother of John W. Bet a Mil . lion Gates , in 1871 is related on the authority of the late William A. Pinkerton , head of the Pinkerton detective agency , which Gates retained to track down the murderer . Disappears on Wagon Trip Gilbert Gates , 20 , disappeared while driving his team and wagon home from Kansas to Illinois in company with Jester , who was driving to Indiana . Asel A. Gates , father of Gilbert and John , then livW illiam S. Forrest ( left ) and Ham A. Pinkerton. ing on his farm near Turner Junction , now West Chicago , III. , hired detectives who apprehended Jester at Valley Center , Kas. , finding in his possession Gilbert 's team and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indicted for the murder of Gates but escaped from the Mexico , Mo. , jail in 1872 and remained at large for 27 years . John Gates , who had vowed in his youth to avenge hit brother 's murder , retained the Pinkertons to find Jester and they finally found him at Shawnee , Okla . Jester , then 72 , was returned to Missouri for trial and Gates retained William S. Forrest , a front rank member of the Chicago bar , to conduct the prosecution . Evidence All Circumstantial The body of Gates was never found . Jester 's defense was that he had bought out Gates for $200 and the youth had driven away ' with a man in a spring wagon . At the close of the trial a minor official who had been in attendance on the jury , whom we may call Mr. X. informed Pinkerton that he would like to talk to Forrest privately about the Jester case . A meeting was arranged at the house where Forrest was staying . Mr. X. informed Forrest that he was born and raised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury . They had been discussing the case with him , he said , and he knew they were satisfied that Jester was guilty . Suggested Jury Be Aided However , it could not be denied that the evidence was cirsumstantial , the corpus delicti had not been established . The members of the jury were all poor boys , while John Gates was a millionaire . A few thousand dollars of extra expense i would mean nothing to Gates ' but would be very helpful to the jurymen . Therefore , if Forrest would agree to pay $25,000 Mr. X would guarantee a hanging verdict on the morrow . Forrest replied that neither he nor his client had ever been a party to such skulduggery and that they had no intention of starting then . He then declared the interview ended and bade Mr. X good afternoon . Mr. X was enraged . " I am widely and favorably known in these parts , " said Mr. X , " and I have seen to it that a number of people have seen me come to your house . Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world that you called me in and tried to bribe the jury . Reporter Behind Screen " Mr. X , " replied Forrest , " when I heard from Mr. Pinkerton that you wanted to see me this afternoon I surmised that something like this was coming up . If you look behind that screen you will see a court reporter who is taking down every word of this conversation . If you open that door you will find a Pinkerton operative who also has heard everything . Now , get the hell out of there and stay out . " The next day the jury brought in a verdict of not guilty . Forrest returned to Chicago and rendered Gates a bill for $10,000 for his fee . Gates returned a check for $25,000 . Forrest returned the check with a note saying there evidently was a mistake , for his fee was only $10,000 . Gates replied that altho Forrest had told him nothing about the incident of Mr. X he had heard the whole story from Billy Pinkerton . Under the circumstances , wrote Gates , Forrest ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forrest to accept the $25,000 as a token of Gates ' appreciation of his services . Calls Presentation Masterly Gates said he was convinced Jester was guilty and Forrest had made a masterly presentation of the case . But the evidence was circumstantial and if the jury had brought in a verdict contrary to the merits of the case it would have been an everlasting discredit to the dates family and would have plagued his conscience for the rest of his life . Another Gates anecdote furnished by a reader is a version attributed to Bet a Million of his famous interview with J. Pierpont Morgan after Morgan had denied Gates a place on the Steel trust directorate because he was uncouth and immoral . According to Gates , all the organizers of the Steel corporation ga v e Morgan their proxies to name the directors . To Gates ' surprise when the names of the directors were published he was not included . Gates in a rage demanded an explanation of Morgan . Very Unpopular Move " I am sorry , Mr. Gates , " said Morgan , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ? consequently your name on the list would be very bad . " " You damned old hypocrite , " said Gates , " you drink more than I do ; you run John W. Gates left and J. pont Morgan . around with women more than I do , but I do it openly and you do it behind closed doors . " Precisely , Mr. Gates , " retorted Morgan , " that is what doors are for . " Lloyd Wendt and Herman Kogan give a mild version of this anecdote in their Gates biografy sans profanity and reference to wine and women . Tho there was common knowledge of Morgan 's mistresses Gates " by that time , " Mr. Wendt tells me , " was n't playing around with the girls . " Morgan 's immorality ch a r g e against Gates , Wendt thinks , related to gambling . Bertha Baur in Tunnel In one of my stories I related that Joseph Medill Patterson , then a cub reporter on THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE , W a s the only reporter who at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug into the temporary postoffice on the lake front in 1901 while the federal building was being constructed . Mrs. Jacob Bertha Baur , noted social and civic leader of Chicago and long the Republican national committee . Write to Henning I Mrs. Bertha D. Baur and Lee Meriwether , whose letters have added mew details to two incidents described by Arthur Sears Henning in his recent memoirs . woman for Illinois , wrote me that she crawled thru that tunnel . On my request she furnished details . She was then Bathe Duppler , secretary to the postmaster , Frederick E. Coyne . " The robbers , " writes Mrs. Baur , . " had a whole week-end to carry out their plan , since the postoffice was closed from Friday night to Monday morning . They dug a tunnel under the rear wall of the building to a point where the cashier 's office was located . " They ? missed the cash Vault but came up in the stamp vault and got away with $74,610 worth of stamps , the biggest postoffice robbery on record . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s were never apprehended nor the stamps recovered . " There was great excitement over the robbery that Monday morning and while the tunnel was not very inviting I crawled thru it just to see how the robbers had done the job . I was young and energetic then and it was just another experience . " I told in one chapter how Lee Meriwether 's book " How to See Europe on Fifty Cents a Day " inspired me to go around the world on the cheap , which I did in 15 months at a cost of $1,000 I had saved working on THE TRIBUNE for two years . When Mr. Meriwether , whose horhe is St. Louis , read my piece he wrote me how he came to write the book . $25 Fare to Italy " In New York on March 10 , 1885r , I saw an advertisment of steerage passage to Naples on a frate boat for $25 , " said Mr. Meriwether . " I had $200 . After buying a knapsack , some clothing , and the ticket to Naples I had $150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My father wrote that what I proposed was fantastic folly , that I should come home and study law and fit myself for my life work . He would send me money to come home when my pocket was empty but not one dollar to continue ' this mad scheme . ' " This letter stung me to the quick . I determined to con tinue the ' mad scheme ' even if it meant swimming to New York and walking to St. Louis . My letters to the New York World , Philadelphia Press , and St. Louis Republican financed my trip as far as Constantinople and Moscow . These letters with additions became the book ' How to See , Europe On Fifty Cents a Day ' which Harper 's published in 1887 . I remember my first check from Harper 's was for $1,000 . I came home , was admitted to the bar and practiced law for 60 years before retiring a few years ago . " My sister , Miss Ethel A. Henning , St. Petersburg , Fla. , contributes an amusing anecdote of Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the intistang " Dauntless " aboard which in 1903 I explored the decayed Illinois and Michigan canal , tile " Tadpole ditch , " and exposed it as a politicians ' sinecure . ? When electric autos came on the market , " she writes , " Mrs. Ellsworth wanted one but Johnny said a dealer in horses should n't drive an auto . Finally he gave in and told her he was going to buy one that day and would call for her at 3 o'clock and take her riding . Unable to Halt Car " At three she was . on her porch and was astonished to see Johnny in a new auto drive right by and still more astonished when he drove by a second time withotit stopping . At his third appearance she was standing on the curb . " ' Ask them to stop this damned thing , ' yelled Johnny . Mrs. Ellsworth telephoned the dealer and on her husband 's fourth appearance yelled the instructions she had received . Eventually she got her ride that afternoon  --  and the auto . But Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In Chapter 7 I described the festive hanging of a mysterious murderer at Paris , Ill. , Dec. 21 , 1900 . I told how the doomed man strolled across the jail Yard hand in hand with 6 year old Asa Myers , son of the sherif , and at the foot of the gallows stopped and kissed little Asa and sent him running back to the jail . I received a letter from Dr. Asa L. Myers of the BesleyWaukegan clinic , Waukegan , Ill. , saying that he was the little boy .
