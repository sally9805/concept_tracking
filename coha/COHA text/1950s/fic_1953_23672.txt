The Seducers A Fragment By Katherine Anne Porter Drawings by Albert Gay A CONFUSION of most promising sounds came from behind the great Funnel on the dimly lighted boat deck ; light scuffling , slipping boot heels , frantic smothered feminine yaps and hisses , a male voice gleefully gurgling and crowing . The twins , Ric and Rac , could not understand the words , but they knew in their bones the lingua franca of gallantry . Discreetly as little foxes they approached , holding each other back , exc  --  anging shrewd glances , the whites of their eyes gleaming , their pointed red tongues running round their open mouths . The wind whistled past their ears and whipped their hair against their cheeks ; their stringy garments flattened against their meager frames , as they leaned upon the funnel and slid round towards the enticing noises . In silence and stillness they observed the expected scene . The scrawny girl Lizzi and the little fat man Herr Rieber were huddled together on the deck , backs to the funnel , fighting , laughing , wrestling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was pulling down her skirts with one hand and pushing feebly at him with the other . Ric and Rac waited for something more interesting , but the scrawny girl broke away and shoved the fat man over almost on his back . The front of her blouse was open to the belt and the children remarked with distaste that there was really nothing to see . Tossing her head about , squealing , the girl 's wild eyes pointed suddenly at Ric and Rae . She gave a shrillscream , " Oh , look , look , oh ? , " waving her long arm at Ric and Rac . Herr Rieber sobered at once , and as Lizzi sprang upright in an . instantaneous unfolding movement like a jackknife , he got to his feet by squatting first , then supporting himself on a coil of rope and at last heaving himself up with a laborious groan . Ric and Rae merely took a step backward around the funnel , balanced for flight if necessary , still gazing . " What are you doing here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Watching you , " said Ric , pertly , putting out her tongue ; and Rae joined in , " Go on , do n't stop . We 'll tell you if anybody 's coming . " Herr Rieber , outraged at such shamelessness , rushed at them snarling but they leaped out of his reach . " Out of here , " bawled Herr Rieber , beside himself . Ric and Rac danced , actually clapping their hands for pure glee , as Herr Rieber bounded after them , aiming blows which landed in air and turned him right about . Ric and Rac pranced savagely round him , shouting , " A peso , a peso , or we 'll tell  --  a peso or we 'll tell ? " " Monsters ! " cried Lizzi , hoarsely , " you horrible little ? " " A peso , a peso , " chanted Ric and Rae , still sliding around Herr Rieber and avoiding his blows with perfect ease . Herr Rieber stopped , panting , head down like an exhausted bull . He reached in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled . Rac put his foot on it . " One for her too , " he said , " one for her . " His face was sharp and cool and wary . Herr Rieber cast away another peso . Rac snatched them both and clutching them in one hand he motioned to Ric who followed him instantly . Running , they collided somewhere at the head of the steps , and both of them saw the same thing at once , and had the same notion about it . The canvas covering of one of the lifeboats was partly unfastened , it hung loose and could easily be opened further . They tried the fastenings which gave way surprisingly ; they raised the flap and wriggled into the boat , Ric first , Rac following . without a word . The boat was very much deeper than they had thought . With a good deal of scrambling about , they managed to bring their faces up to the opening in the flap , where they listened attentively , faces touching , for some moments . Then the fat man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blouse and both of them very angry looking . Rac lost his balance and made a scrabbling noise ; the girl turned her head and peered toward them without seeing ; then she stumbled on the stairs and the fat man seized her ann . " Stop-that , " she said bitterly . Ric and Rae . fell back into the boat , all tangled up giggling in the darkness . " Give me my peso , " said Ric fiercely , seizing Rac in the ribs and digging her nails in . " Give me my peso or tear your eyes out . " " Take it , " said Rac , in the same tone , clenching his fist over the money ; " go on take it , just try . " Locked in what appeared to be a death grapple , they rolled to the bottom of the boat and fought furiously , knees in ribs , claws in hair . Little by little they fell quiet and then began to giggle . A young officer passing stopped and listened , his face very thoughtful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw there seemed to turn him to stone for a split second . Then throwing himself over the side and bending down he seized them and dragged them both over the sides of the boat . They came out limp and dangling as broken dolls . I A CoNnEsA and Dr. Sacher were stretched at ease in their deck chairs watching 4 the foxfire dance in the darkened sea , and the Doctor was saying : " One has no new weaknesses , no new strengths , but only de-velopments , accentuations , or perversions of original potentialities . As one grows older , one is more conscious perhaps . One attempts to keep account , you might say . One realizes simply that what one was told in childhood is after all true  --  one is immortal certainly , but not in this flesh . One ... " He stopped . " One , one  --  one , " said La Condesa lightly , " who is this One you 're always talking about ? Let 's talk about us . " " Myself , I have a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship as doctor for a few voyages to he quiet , to get a little repose , imagine . Now if I can only live long enough once more to see my wife chasing the chickens out of our country kitchen with a broom , and scolding , I shall ask no more . How much that woman has scolded me , and everybody and everything , all her lifetime , with such good reason ; for everybody 's good , and what has it come to ? " " Well , " said La Condesa gaily , " for you at least , it has come to an end for a little while . " Dr. Sacher chose to smile only a little at this and looked away over the rail into the sea . " Imagine me , a doctor , after all these years in quiet Heidelberg thinking I would find repose ' from this . world on ship . I am astonished at myself for thinking , now maybe I shall learn something new about myself or the people I live with : but no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , only never until now did I see it on a ship . These people , I have seen them all before , only in other places , under different names . I know their diseases by looking at them , and if you know what sickness is in a man you know what form his vices and his virtues will take . " " Now talk about me , " said La Condesa , clasping her long hands tightly around her upraised knee and bending forward . There appeared at the upper end of the deck an unusual group , in a state of violent action . The young officer with his cap knocked to one side was struggling with two children . Yet in spite of this the officer continued to advance firmly and made a kind of ragged progress toward Dr. Sacher and La Condesa , hauling his captives . " More mischief , " said Dr. Sacher rather coolly . " I have yet to see those children in a situation where they are not making trouble for somebody . " He called out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young officer blushed at Dr. Sacker 's question . He planted himself and renewed his grip on Ric and Rac who suddenly gave up struggling and stood stock still , staring at nothing . The young officer began , " These children , these unspeakable ? " Ric and Rac made a concentrated bolt for freedom in opposite directions so that his arms flew wide but lie did not lose his grip on them . His blush deepened until his ears seemed about to burst into flames . He turned , mouth gaping and closing in silence , to Dr. Sadler , but in the presence of a lady he could not condi tie . -/ am a mother , " said La Condesa encouragingly , giving him a most unmaternal smile ; her bright red mouth rounded and softened , her eyebrows went up . " I can guess the very worst , and truly I must say I do not find it so bad . What do you think , Doctor ? " " I agree that no matter what they did , they are little monsters , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without hope , " and entirely outside of any usual mode of disci-pline . " " They were in a lifeboat , " said the young officer , stuttering slightly . " They had unfastened the edge of the canvas top and crawled in . . " " And were amusing themselves ? " asked La Condesa . " Well , it fart passer la jeunesse infancy is a great bore , I find , one 's own first , and then other infancies ... My poor children were not in the least monstrous , they were quite simply bores until they were eighteen years old . Then they became charming young men to whom one could talk . I do not know how this miracle occurs ... and so , " she added , " we must wait and have patience with these phenomena , " and she smiled enchantingly at the children , who stared back with utter malignity . " Nothing of the kind will happen with these , " said Dr. Sachcr . And then to the young officer , " Ca n't you just hand them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God ! " said the young officer in a spurt of contempt and despair . " Then , " said La Condesa , see nothing for it but to let them go  --  or , " and she gazed tenderly into the burning eyes of the two little criminals , " perhaps we should save time and trouble for everybody if we threw them overboard ? " " Yes a good idea , " said the young officer bitterly , " and a pity that it can not be carried out . " " Oh , you take everything too seriously , " said La Condesa . " They 're only children . " " Devil-possessed , though , " said Dr. Sadler . La Condesa studied his friendly benevolent face . " What an old-fashioned sort of man you are , " she said admiringly . The Doctor 's eyelids flinched once . " Yes , I know  --  a little dull no doubt . " " Rut charming ! " said La Condesa , and reached for his hand . T HE young officer saw himself abandoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if throwing off vipers . They broke into their long shambling run up the deck . He bowed with bitter courtesy to La Condesa and the Doctor , straightened his hat , and moved on . La Condesa glanced after him and laughed . Her tone was fresh and joyful , her eyes glistening . " Poor young man , " she said , " he 's still too young , too young to remember his own childhood ! Children are such natural little beasts , why be shocked at them ? " " Not these , " said Dr. Sacher , " never these . They are a serious case . They will come to no good end . " " They are not in such a good state now , " said La Condesa . " What kind of childhood had you ? " " An innocent one , " said Dr. Sachet- , " I like to think ? " " Ah , so you like to think and maybe it is true , " cried La Condesa . " Ca n't you remember anything interesting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Sacher meditated in silence for a moment , then began to smile reluctantly . " Innocence , " he said , " our highly debatable innocence . . . " " So you do have some amusing secrets , " said 1 , a Condesa , laying her silky hand over his . the blue veins standing up , branched like a little tree . " Well , the truth is I was never innocent , never . I had not the opportunity , for one-thing , surrounded as I was by attractive cousins , boys of the most adventurous temperament ; besides I had no aptitude for it , above all , never the wish . I could never endure to think any pleasure was being kept from me . I surmised everything very early . From there to experience , it was only a step ; from experience to habit a matter of moments . I regret nothing but that I did not always make the most of my opportunities . " " I was innocent , " said Dr. Sacher , " as a calf ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without cares , with a belief in all that I had been taught , an obedient loving child . Still , it is true that at the age of five I seduced my little cousin age three and at six 1 was in turn seduced by a female playmate age nine . Both of them very nice , charming , virtuous girls who turned out well , married happilyand spanked their own children thoroughly for the least thing . As for innocence , what is it ? For I remember guilt and pleasure . always associated , yet never seeming to touch that part of my life and those acts which seemed real to me and not a fable , or a dream , and which were innocent . " " I had all the joys of sinning without guilt , " said La Condesa with a certain complacency . " But you must have been a charming little person . I should have adored you . Some of my crimes were of a baser order  --  when I was four I persuaded my little brother to drink lye water used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took a mouthful , spat it out , and ran screaming ; he was rescued at once , his mouth was washed . I was punished , beaten black and blue ; otherwise nothing came of it . And indeed I meant no harm ; I only wished to see what he would do when he tasted the stuff . " " Ah , childhood , " said Dr Sadler , " time of the tender bud , the unfolding leaf . " They both laughed pleasantly and sat back in their long chairs . " Truth is , it was not so bad , " said La Condesa . She lifted the Doctor 's hand and slipped her fingers between his , knitting them toart her - - " I love you , " she said gently and unexpectedly , " not so much you , yourself , though you are very nice , but I love what you are . I like gravity and seriousness and strong principles in a man . There is nothing more repellent to me than a frivolous , timid , vacillating man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . And why ? Because then he can not ever know the mind and heart of a woman . Were you ever unfaithful to your wife ? " " Well ! " exclaimed Dr. Sacher . " What a question . " " Oh yes , I know , you have to be surprised and even a little shocked . It is quite proper , you 're always right . But think a moment . It is not just curiosity and impertinence in me . It may be partly that , but there is something more besides , and it is that something more I want you to believe ? " Dr. Sacher untangled his fingers From her , took her hand in his , and then slipped his fingers on her pulse . " How does it do ? " she asked . " Is it settling down ? " Very well , " he said , ' perhaps better than mine . But then I have told you , " he said , and yet he could not help mentioning again his unsteady heart . " At any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clown again . " I think it is enviable to know how you will die , " she said , " and that it will be cleanly and suddenly . I wish I knew , because 1 am afraid of long suffering and disfigurement . I do n't want to leave a hideous body behind me ? " " You are just hopelessly vain , " said Dr. Sacher , " hut I know that nothing is more precious than beauty to the one who has it . And it is like any other gift or quality that is in the least worth having. , you must be born with it , you can not acquire it , and you should treat it as it deserves . " - " But you find me beautiful now ? " " Of course , " said the doctor . After a little pause , he said , " I will answer your question truthfully . I was never unfaithful to my wife . " " How - charming of you , " said La Condesa sympathetically . " It must have been dull at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Sacher simply , " but she was faithful to me , and that could have been a little dull for her too , at times . " " Were you really so very good because you wished to be , or was it your weak heart ? " " My heart was sound until about two years ago , " said Dr. Sadler with a faint trace of resentment . " But you love me just a little , do n't you ? " " No , " said Dr. Sacher , " not at all . Not at all if I know in the least what love is . I know that is not very gallant , I know what I should say , but I am not a man who can afford to say what he does not mean . There is perhaps not time for it . " already seen us , " said Dr. Sadler , " the very one of all people who would most enjoy it . " They sat in silence , hands folded , heads inclined toward the sea , faces tranquil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine weather for sitting out , " she informed them in a high clear voice , full of the most intimate sympathy and comprehension . She paused , shivered a little , and wrapped her thin scarf about her bare arms . " Perhaps one should be careful of night air , especially at sea , " she said , smiling gaily . She bent over and peered into their faces , with a look of the most ravenous inquiry . They gazed back calmly . A second 's pause and Frau Rittersdorf moved on slowly tossing back over her shoulder , " After all , rheumatism and arthritis lurk in night air and we 're only young once . " " What a museum piece , " said La Condesa in a clear rather high but sweet voice pointing her lips at Frau Rittersdurf 's undulating back . " Oh come now , " said Dr. Sacher mildly , " do leave that kind of thing to her , " and he seemed slightly ruffled and uncomfortable . La Condesa gave a trill of laughter edged like a little saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieved and weary . " I loathe women , " she said , in a tone of flat , commonplace sincerity such as the Doctor had never heard in her voice . " I hate being one . It is a shameful condition . I can not he reconciled to it . " " That is a pity , " said Dr. Sacher . " And you are wrong . It may be a misfortune to be a woman , so many of you seem to think so , but there is nothing shameful in it . The truth is , " he told her , earnestly , " you are a more than ordinarily perverse sort of woman , arid a change of sex would do nothing for you . There are many men of your temperament ; if you were a man , you would still be a mischief-maker , a taker of drugs , a seducer . " La Condesa rose lightly as a cloud , opened her arms wide as if to embrace him , leaned over him smiling and gay . " Naturally ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more opportunity , and no scolding from mossy old souls like you ... " Dr. Sadler rose deliberately and stepped back from her hands that were about to rest on his shoulders . " T am not scolding , " he said angrily , " and you arc talking like any foolish woman ! " " And you sound like a husband , " cried La Condesa over his shoulder , for he had turned and was walking away , " like any foolish man ! " and her terrible peals and trills of laughter followed him , blowing like a cold rain down his collar as she ran after him , came abreast , slipped her arm around his elbow , and folded her hand into his . " You are adorable , and you ca n't shake me off , " for Dr. Sacher was trying to reclaim his arm without losing at least the appearance of dignity . She loosed his arm and stepped before him , and he saw that her eyes were wild and inhuman as a monkey 's . " Stop , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She held his hands and laid her head on his shoulder lightly for an instant . " I am. tired , I am crazy , T want to sleep or die . . . You must give me a piertire , a huge one that will make me sleep for days . .. Do n't leave me , you ca n't , you sha n't . . Oh , quiet me  --  put me to sleep ! " Dr. Sacher gripped her hands and held her off , searching her face shrewdly , hoping to be able to refuse her : but what he saw decided him at once . " Yes , " he said quietly , " yes . " She was silent , and they walked together through the ship toward her cabin . " Ah , " she said , and turned to him under the mottled light of the passage a ravaged and desolate face , unbelievably changed , " all , you are so good . Oh , never believe T am not grateful ... and now I sha n't have to take ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rising note though it was not a question . " You still have ether ? You did keep back a flask , then ? " " Of course , " she said , with a faintly contemptuous patience . " When will you learn not to trust me in anything ? " Dr. Sachet . stopped . " Even nol .. v ? " he asked . " Even now , " she said boldly . " Well , " he said at last , " you shall have your piqare just the same . Go on , " lie said , turning off toward his own cabin . " I will join you in a few minutes . You can trust rue , " he said , and was amazed at his own bitterness .
