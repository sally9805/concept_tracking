OF THE various art books which have come to hand for the Christmas trade the most sumptuous are three printed in Italy for the New York Graphic Society ; they contain the finest color reproductions I have yet seen . One is on the Ravenna mosaics ( 45 plates , $20 ) . The two others , on Spanish Romanesque painting and on the Masaccio frescoes in Florence ( each with 32 plates at $16 50 ) , are published by arrangement with UNESCO as part of its world art series . Since one has been led to think of Byzantine art as formal and decorative , the psychological realism of the portraits shown here in detail is a great surprise The volume on Romanesque Spain shows a series of wall paintings from churches and museums , rich and sombre , calligraphic and severe The volume on Masaccio brings those extraordinary Florentine frescoes close up and exhibits their grave and convincing humanity in a way otherwise impossible to see , even on the spot . Another handsome book with more than 500 llustrations in color and in black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painting to Modern Times , by H. W. Janson and Dora Jane Janson ( Harry N. Abrams. 520 pp. $15 ) . The text is in the simple style appropriate for the young . The color plates are inaccurate but the black and white cuts are admirable . Two important surveys are Three Hundred Years of American Painting by Alexander Eliot ( Time , Inc. 316 pages of text and 250 color illustrations . $13.50 ) and New Art in America by John I H. Bauer , Lloyd Goodrich , Dorothy C. Miller , James Thrall Soby and Frederick S. Wight ( Frederick A. Praeger. 280 pp. $22.50 ) . The first of these is a history of American painting from Colonial times . Its many color illustrations are well-selected but of poor quality . They are presumably printed from plates used in Time or Life and , as in those magazines , give no idea of color or paint surface . The text by the art editor of Time is well written and the book is reasonably complete , with a chronological chart of painters and a useful list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America presents the work of fifty American painters since 1900 . The five authors are directors or curators of the Whitney Museum , the Museum of Modern Art of New York and the Art Gallery of the University of California ; the fifty names can be taken as the list of painters officially admired . It is nevertheless surprising that the editors excluded a painter as celebrated as Reginald Marsh and at the same time included three relatively unimportant primitive painters , and the photographer , Man Ray . The black and white illustrations , printed by offset , are excellent ; the color plates are not too good . The color illustrations in The German Expressionists by Bernard S. Myers ( Praeger. 401 pp. $15 ) are much better , perhaps because the book was printed in Germany . Mr. Myers was also the author of the catalogue to the exhibition of the German Expressionists held recently at the Museum of Modern Art . The present volume contains a much more varied selection than the museum was able to assemble . TWO other specialized histories are new this season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picasso ( Crown Publishing Co. 150 pp. $5 95 ) , is rather a discussion of caricature in its relation to art than a history of caricature itself . Many among its ninety to one hundred illustrations ? as those by Puvis de Chavannes and James Ensor ? seem chosen more as names than for wit . One would also have preferred more examples and less explanation . On the other hand , The Indian Art of Mexico and Central America , by the late Miguel Covarrubias ( Knopf. 360 pp. $17.50 ) is probably the most valuable book for the general public yet to appear on that subject . It is authoritative , complete and clear , with innumerable drawings by the author and an extensive album of photographs . The World of Abstract Art , edited by the American Abstract Artists ( George Wittenborn , Inc. 167 pp. $8 50 ) and the Dictionary ' of Abstract Painting by Michel Seuphor ( Tudor Publishing Co. 305 pp. $6.95 ) deal with the same painters and in somewhat the same way . The Dictionary is the handsomer of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books on particular painters is one on Klee , translated from the Italian of G. di San Lazzaro ( Praeger. 304 pp. $5.75 ) . It is beautifully made and profusely illustrated in black and white and in color , perfect for anyone interested in this painter 's work . Marc Chagall by Walter Erben ( Praeger. 158 pages of text and 64 of plates . $7.50 ) , is an elaborate appreciation of the artist 's work . The black and white reproductions are good , as usual , and the color plates , also as usual traduce the originals . Among the books on artistic generalities are The Functional Line in Painting by Aaron Berkman ( Thomas Yoscloff. 100 pp. $6. ) and Native Genius in Anonymous Architecture , by Sybil Moholy-Nagy ( Horizon Press . 223 pp. $7.50 ) . The first consists of handsome black and white illustrations imbedded in a somewhat inept text , over-insistent on the tru.i.sm of the importance of line in art . The second is a lively exposition , illustrated with photographs from many lands and cultures , of the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also two books on aesthetics of a more serious nature . The Collective Dream in Art by Walter Abell ( Harvard University Press . 378 pages of text ; 39 of plates . $7.50 ) presents under the name of psycho-history a theory of art criticism based on the idea of art as an expression of the collective tensions of a civilization . The theme is interesting but it is couched in a loose , wordy , Ph.D . style . On the other hand , PaintIng and Reality by Etienne Gilson , a distinguished authority on Thomism ( Pantheon Books . 367 pp. $7 50 ) is both a sensible and a readable approach to a philosophy of art , based not on a theory of history , but on pictures themselves and on what painters say about their art . There are also four new books in which painters present their side . Conversations with Artists , by Selden Rodman ( Devin Adair , 256 pp. $4 ) ; The Yes and No of Contemporary Art , by George Biddle ( Harvard University Press . 188 pp. $5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard University Press . 131 pp. $4 ) ; and Dali on Modern Art ( The Dial Press . 91 pages of English text followed by the French original . $5 ) . Rodman 's readable Conversations consists of a series of interviews with American artists ranging from Steinberg and Wyeth to Rothko and Klein , with descriptions of their personalities and their opinions . George Biddle 's book presents the reflections on painting of a prominent and cultivated American painter . Ben Shahn 's book , from his Charles Eliot Norton lectures delivered at Harvard and illustrated with some of the artist 's drawings , is well organized and well written . It defends with clarity , wit and conviction a painter 's view on painting  --  one with which very few painters would disagree . As for Dali on Modern Art , he is against it : " Painters , do not concern yourselves with being modern . It is the only thing , unfortunately , no matter what you do , that you can not avoid being " ; and " The least one can ask of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " THE best art magazine in the world today is L'oeil , a French monthly published in Switzerland . A Swiss publication , also a monthly , which carries a great deal of excellent art , is Du . Both can be subscribed to through the usual magazine agencies . IF one thinks of giving drawings as Christmas presents , there is a considerable choice in the galleries . Jacques Seligmann is having a show of 15th to 460 20th century French drawings , beginning at $300 . Eugene Berman 's fine gouache sketches for the Metropolitan 's new production of Don Giovanni are available at Knoedler 's from $175 to $250 . Carstair has drawings by Peter Mitchell at the same price and drawings by Dali and Picasso beginning at $400 . A DEATH IN THE FAMILY . By James Agee . McDowell , Obolensky. 339 pp. $3 95 . David L. Stevenson JAMES AGEE was a journalist , a motion picture critic , a writer of screen plays and television scripts But he also had a special talent as a purely creative writer which he had exhibited , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me Voyage ( Yale , 1934 ) , and in two later short stories , " The Morning Watch " ( Partiran Review , 1951 ) , and " A Mother 's Tale " ( Harper 's Bazaar , 1952 ) . The posthumously published A Death in the Family is Agee 's final item of his career in letters , a novel on which he had been at work for eight years . It does not give him any new importance as an American writer , but it does bring to a delicate and satisfying flowering his very great ability to create the qualities and the nuances of private feeling . A Death , in the Family is not a ma-jor book , but a haunting one . It presents human anguish in language of surface accuracy and of great evocative power Phrase after phrase sets all the tentacles of the reader 's private sea of the subconscious alert and waving It is also a curiously intractable book because it constantly raises the question of what a novel exists to do Like his earlier " The Morning Watch , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told as if it were a novel . The book opens with a generalized prelude : the Follet family on any warm summer night in Knoxville , Tennessee , in 1915 , sitting . in family contentment on the back lavcn after a six o'clock supper , with the remaining daylight " shining softly and with a tarnish , like the lining of a shell " Then a specific night in the Follet family is presented . The father and his six-year-old son , Rufus , go to a Chaplin movie . Rufus goes to bed , aware of his father 's comfortable The Little Gallery has drawings by young Americans from $15 ; and the skillful evocations of native life in Bahia by the distinguished Brazilian painter , Caribe , are on show at the Bodley Gallery at prices from $75 to $200 .

Before he drives off , his wife fixes him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rufus never sees him again ; he is killed in an accident . The rest of the book relates the state of shock of the mother , the varied reactions of her relatives and those of Rufus . A Death in the Family comes to an end with Rufus listening to his uncle , after the funeral , exploding in anger at grief and death . These events have an intense emotional effect on the reader because of Agee 's skill in presenting them with an almost intolerable immediacy . Rufus , standing at the curb , watches a horse " draw a buggy crisply but sedately past , " and notes that " in the washed black spokes , sunlight twittered . " And Agee can hold the reader 's emotions in much tighter rein . The accuracy of his description of Rufus ' first view of his father 's coffin forces the reader to hold on desperately to his own com-posure : It was very long and dark ; smooth like a boat ; with bright handles . Half the top was open . There was a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized . Rufus had never known such stillness . Their little sounds as they approached his father , vanished upon it like the infinitesimal whisperings of snow , falling on open water . There was his head , his arms ; suit ; there he was . But it is the very intensity of feeling , beautifully poised in words , which puts severe limitations on A Death in the Family . Serious prose fiction characteristically demonstrates the possibilities and the results of its given events , and of its given characters ' acts and decisions Agee was unwilling or unable to endow either the events or the characters of hiss novel with this fictional vitality and coherence . He exploits only the emotional content of his material , not its meaning A Death in the Family , therefore , has little of fiction 's cusT Ire NATION
