txt BALTIMORE , Nov. 14 ? The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad asked permission today to end its passenger service between Baltimore and New York . The request was made in petitions filed late today with the Public Service Commission of Maryland and with similar authorities in Delaware and Pennsylvania . Permission to discontinue the passenger trains is not required in New Jersey since no intrastate travel is involved . The only stop in New Jersey is the terminal point at Jersey City . The move was dictated , the railroad announced , by what it described as " an enormous deficit in passenger operations . " All Runs Affected If granted , the petition would allow the line to withdraw all passenger trains running between Baltimore , Wilmington , Philadelphia and the Jersey City terminal . Passenger service between Baltimore and Washington ; Baltimore and Chicago ; and Baltimore and St. Louis would not be affected . The line runs twelve trains daily , six in each direction , between Baltimore and New York . Two others run between Washington and Philadelphia . Since 1946 , . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has declined 46 per cent . It represents 5 per cent of the total passenger traffic between the two points . The Federal Interstate Commerce Commission is not involved in the request , according to a B. &; 0 . spokesman , because none of the Baltimore-toNew York facilities would be abandoned . Freight traffic would continue to use the same station points . No Adverse Effort Noted Discontinuation of the passenger service , the petition declared , would not affect the public adversely . " Other public transportation facilities , amply sufficient to meet the public convenience and necessity , are in operation for the handling of passenger traffic , " it said . The petition . noted that the Pennsylvania Railroad operated twenty trains daily in both directions between the points in contrast to the B. &; 0 . ' s six daily round trips . It also cited fifty daily round trips offered by bus lines , thirteen round trips by airlines , as well as eighty-one direct Washington to New York flights . In addition , the railroad said , B. &; 0 . Seeks Permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel the line 's tracks . The petition declared that the public had " substantially abandoned " the use of trains for these other modes of travel . It also attributed this loss in patronage to " the large expenditures made in recent years by state and Federal bodies for the improvement of highway and air travel " between the two points . Expense Rise Cited The decline in patronage has been paralleled by a drastic increase in operating expenses resulting in an out-of-pocket loss from passenger operations of many millions of dollars a year , the ' carrier said . Baltimore and Ohio 's move follows an announcement less than two weeks ago by the New York Central and the Pennsylvania that they would initiate studies looking toward a merger . In their announcement the Central and the Pennsylvania listed numerous troubles afflicting railroads , particularly in the East . Among them was " the refusal by authorities to permit the abandoning of unprofitable and unpatronized trains and facilities . " Last year the Baltimore &; Ohio had a net income of $30 , - 038,000 , its best year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road earned $18 , - 008,278 compared with $21 , - 010,030 in the same period last year . Expected by Wall Street Wall Street has long expected some such move by the Baltimore and Ohio . The expectation dates to the Nineteen Twenties , when the railroad 's World War I contract permitting it to run trains into Pennsylvania Station here was discontinued by the Pennsylvania The Pennsylvania itself suggested in the . Nineteen Thirties that the B. &; 0 . discontinue its Washington-Baltimore-New York trains . But the idea was rejected . Actually , the B. &; 0 . trains that run into Jersey City from Washington and Baltimore use their own tracks only into Fair-mount Park in Philadelphia . At that point the trains be-come Reading Railroad trains until they reach Bound Brook , N. J. , when they run over the tracks of the Central Railroad of New Jersey into Jersey City . The B. &; 0 . is Reading 's largest single stockholder and the Reading in turn is the Jersey Central 's principal stockholder . The B. &; 0 . did not have available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Route , as the **27;359;TOOLONG City service is called . But the railroad maintains that for every $1 it collects it spends $2.40 providing the service . Wall Street 's estimate is that the railroad would save more than $5,000,000 annualy by dropping the route . B. &; 0 . ' s passenger service operations , on the basis of I. C. C. accounting procedures , result in an annual deficit of $33,789,000 . The road insists that for every $1 it collects in fares and on mail receipts , express and baggage receipts , it spends $1.831 , operating its passenger trains . After the B. ? &; 0 . filed its application , a New York Central spokesman said : " It 's completely news to us . We may have a comment tomorrow morning . " In Philadelphia a Pennsylvania official remarked , " I do n't know what we can say . I guess we are n't going to say anything to this one . "
