The holder of the oldest name in automatic washers tossed in the towel last week . Bendix Home Appliances , which brought out the world 's first automatic washer in 1937 , will be sold , pending approval of final terms , by Avco Manufacturing Corp . to Philco Corp . Avco also said it will close its money-losing Crosley appliance business ( refrigerators , ranges , radio-TV ) , leaving 78 distributors around the nation with nothing to distribute . Chairman Victor Emanuel ticked off a host of reasons for Avco 's retreat from appliances : " Increasingly severe competition , large over-capacities , rampant price-cutting , rising costs of labor and material . " <P> Like Autos . Like Avco. many another appliance maker has found itself unable to cover the high costs of nationwide distribution , of straining to produce a full line of models and retooling for new models . As a result , the industry is going through the same kind of consolidation that the automobile industry experienced . Said Westinghouse Vice President Chris J. Witting : " Appliances can be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies covering the field . " <P> Sales already are rapidly concentrating among the industry 's Big Five : General Electric , Westinghouse , Philco . RCA and General Motors ' Frigidaire Division . <P> In recent years almost 200 makers of appliances have merged or liquidated . Last year International Harvester shucked off its refrigerator and freezer branches . La March Deep Freeze , a household word discontinued business . Thor Corp . dropped its washing-machine business . TV manufacturers liquidated by the handful or so out to bigger companies . <P> " This year has been the most rugged of history , " says Bernard A. Chapman , general manager of American Motors Corp . Appliance Division ( Kelvinator ) . Although sales are big , production capacity is much bigger . Said the vice president of another appliance maker : " The U.S. has enough appliance producers to make two or three times the amount the market can absorb . " Complained a small appliance maker from Chicago : " The little guy has two choices : drop out or sell to the big fellow . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to carry only one or two brand names and well-advertised , full lines . When a customer buys a Philco refrigerator , he will have Philco in mind when shopping for a telvision set . Under Chairman William Balderston , Philco has been moving into full-line diversification , since 1949 has bought up the Electromaster Inc. range line , the Dexter Co. home-laundry line , will get still another new family of washers and Bendix . <P> <P> Sins of Bigness . This trend to bigness is criticized by some of the bigwigs . One of the strongest voices is that of Judson Sayre , who as Bendix president in 1941-55 , probably did more than any other man to promote the automatic washer ; he now heads Borg-Warner 's fast-growing North Division ( 1955 sales : about $129 million , triple the 1953 volume ) . Says Sayre : " The industry has been committing every sin in the book . Some of the giants have a policy of ' buying off ' key markets . They have been moving appliances through big dealers who operate on a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers and small markups. "
