txt Age is no handicap for the nresent day policeman . Commissioner O'Connor said yesterday discussing a statement in the city government reorganization plan , prepared by Griff enhagen and Associates , consultants , that O'Connor men who enter the department while in their 20s make better policemen than those who join in their 30 's . O'Connor said that altho there is no plan afoot to raise or lower the present 63 years for compulsory retirement age , he favors lifting it to 65 . O'Connor pointed out that 90 per cent of the policemen who retire today obtain new jobs in other fields , and have many years of usefulness left . It is his view that what physical impairment comes to a policeman with age is more than balanced by his experience and seasoning . Retirement Hiked Wages Age forced the retirement of Sgt. Tom Laffey , who , O'Connor said , solved the Degnan murder case . But Laffey was not too old to go to work for Sherif Babb as a finger print expert ? at a salary DOHERTY higher than he earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner , had to take his pension a few years ago , O'Connor said , and is now better paid as an investigator . John Kustusch , one of the city 's best detectives , dug up his old union card and returned to his trade as a plumber . There are no beer-belly policemen on the force any more , O'Connor stated ? they do n't walk beat and stop for a drink at every tavern , as in days of old . Most of them are in motorized units , and they are active . They seldom need to use their fists but are , trained in the art of judo and are experts with firearms , so , O'Connor said , they use brain instead of brawn . Producers Are Kept While it is true the majority of men assigned to traffic and to the detective bureau are in the younger age groups , there is no departmental rule on the subject , the commissioner said . Many of the best crossing cops have been in the Loop for 10 to 25 years , he said . Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff with young men and sending some of the older ones to outlying districts , but there is no rule or policy back of the practice . As long as his men produce he keeps them , he said .
