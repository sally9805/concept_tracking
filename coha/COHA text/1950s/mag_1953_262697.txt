First there was the big " Five-Antis " campaign of last year . Since then . Peking propagandists have been adding a bewildering list of numerical sins to the jargon of Communism , alongside " commandism. " " dispersionism , " " tailism , " and kindred diseases . Not to be outdone , the Tientsin financial and economic department confessed that it was beset by the " Four Know-Nots " : not knowing what its officials were doing , not knowing the amount of capital invested in public enterprises , not knowing losses &; gains , not knowing the amount of cash on hand . Last week the Peking People 's Daily proclaimed a new self-criticism campaign , labeled : " The Five Too Many . " The Five : " Too many tasks , too many meetings , too many documents and forms , too many organizations and too many concurrent posts for cadres . " In some localities " another too-many has been added-too many check-up teams . "                 @ @ @ @
