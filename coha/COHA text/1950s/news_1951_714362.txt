txt There has been no more poignant news published in this or any other newspaper for many a day than the lists of names which have been coming ' from Tokyo identifying more than three thousand American prisoners held by the North Koreans and Chinese . There was a strong supposition that these men were dead . Their families mourned them as such . They are not yet free . We do not yet know how , much carelessness or brutality there : may have been in the enemy 's prepara.tion of the lists . None the less , hope , came to many families at the very time of the year when it is so hard to be without hope . Aaronson , Anderson , Augliera  --  these are not names but young men not much different from any young men walking the streets today except in the terror and toughness of the experience through which they have passed . Bailey , Boaz , Brown  --  these are not serial numbers and addresses but human lives . Campbell , Celusniak , Curry " ttese had and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . Jackson , .1 .. tibinski , McCoy , Prosperi , Stanley , Velasquez , Zollenheffer -- these were not : distinguished from the rest of our young men except as fate sent them to Korea . Now their families have some ? assurance that they who were dead are . now alive again . , But in this cautious and qualified re-joicing let us not forget that there are other young men ; not unlike Aaronson , - Anderson , Augliera , Bailey , Boaz , Brown and the rest , who will not come ' back . The known American dead of the Korean war are now approaching 16,000 . More than 9,000 over and above those whose names have been recorded by the enemy are still missing and their fate is not known . These young men , - too , have parents and wives . and - in many cases children much like these whose faces we have seen smiling ih almost incredulous joy in last week 's papers . These young men , too , were real . They , too , had their ambitions , their hopes and plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . For the few ' thousand stories with the possibly happy ending there are these others with an ending no hap , pier than the presentation of some posthumous award , and even the Medal of Honor does not bring back the dead . The fighting in Korea will be continued or resumed if no satisfactory truce arrangements can be made with the enemy . If this happens the armies of the United Nations will go on in sorrow and with no thought of glory . ' The only justification fpr the suffering ' of the prisoners who may be returned to us , ? for the pain , of wounds and for the loss of those valiant men who will not come back , is that their sacrifices may prevent other and greater wars . It is that they may bring the world nearer to the peace and security to seek which all nations , including the Communist nations , bound themselves , at San Francisco more than six years ago . But let us remember , if further sacrifices are demanded , that the names of soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics  --  they are warm with the fear and pain and joy of human life lived at its fullest .
