One of the most straightforward and unambiguous art exhibits in Manhattan last week occupied a table in an upstairs room of a 57th Street gallery . It was a polyptych of five small panels hinged together and somewhat pompously titled A Tribute to the American Working People . The four side panels represent a county fair , a parlor , a farm and a schoolroom , all crowded . The center panel portrays a workman with the expression of a weary Punch , standing before a green factory facade full of faces . <P> Pretty Honore Sharrer , 30 , a Cambridge , Mass , housewife , spent five years and wore out roughly 225 tiny brushes on the job . <P> <P> She thought little of devoting a whole day to dotting the right expression into an-eye only 1/16th of an inch in diameter , needed new glasses herself before she had done . <P> The 59 figures in the polyptych include witty to catty personifications of a multitude of U.S. types . Copied mostly from Sharrer 's snapshots of real people , they have the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharrer arranged the figures in her pictures after drawing them all separately , admits it was a tedious problem to squeeze them into some sort of composition . The results are cluttered , and made more so by Sharrer 's inability to put a sense of space into her backgrounds . Yet the golden 5 o'clock light , perhaps symbolic of quitting time , that floods the center panel is perfectly convincing , and all five panels sparkle with masterpieces of precise miniature art . <P> Despite its faults , the polyptych shows that Painter-Housewife Sharrer deserves a-place in the front rank of those U.S. artists who still put content first and paint it to look as real as possible .
