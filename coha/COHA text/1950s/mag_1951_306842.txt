Short Circuit Just as aluminum holds the key to aircraft production , electric power holds the key to aluminum . Almost half of all U.S. aluminum is now produced in the Pacific Northwest , normally the source of abundant hydroelectric power . But last week that power was growing scarce ; the Columbia River , which is studded with dams ( Grand Coulee , Bonneville ) , was at the lowest level in 20 years . As a result , aluminum 's Big Three-Alcoa , Reynolds and Kaiser-were forced to cut their Northwest production as much as 10% . <P> To meet this threat to rearmament , Defense Mobilizer Charles E. Wilson sent wires to all three producers , asking them to draw up plans to remove at least part of their facilities to regions where power is more abundant ( e.g. , the Ohio River ) . As alternatives , he asked them to determine if the emergency could be met more economically by building additional standby steam plants in the Northwest . In alarm , Northwest Congressmen cried that the real solution is more hydroelectric dams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Northwest . Because of materials shortages , primarily structural steel , there is acute danger that the U.S. power industry will not be able to keep pace with rearmament 's growing demands . Warned the Defense Electric Power Administration : by year 's end , industries in many regions will face periodic stoppages in electric service . By the end of 1953 , unless the power industry gets more materials , the shortage will amount to 4,000 , - ooo kilowatts ( 5% of all present U.S. power capacity ) .
