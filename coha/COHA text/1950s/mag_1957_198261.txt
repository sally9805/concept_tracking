Hospitality was the word for Old Virginia , and in honor of this year 's celebration of the 350th anniversary of the settlement of Jamestown , the Old Dominion decided to put out the welcome mat for Old Virginians living outside the state . Down the lists of distinguished ex-Virginians went the official hosts ; out to some 600 notables went engraved invitations to a reception May 17 , arranged by the State Chamber of Commerce . <P> Then the hospitality suddenly turned cold . Among the first to accept the invitation was Dr. Clilan B. Powell , a New York physician and publisher ( Amsterdam News ) , born and raised in Newport News and only recently returned from the independence ceremonies in Ghana ( TIME , March 18 ) , where he was entertained by , among others , the Duchess of Kent . In rechecking the list a chamber official discovered that Dr. Powell is a Negro . <P> The Chamber of Commerce wired a withdrawal of the invitation , and Dr. Powell , who at first insisted that he would attend , finally bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart heard about the ruckus and decided that she would not accept her invitation . In Chicago , Roosevelt University Sociology Professor St. Clair Drake also received an invitation , but the word from Richmond was that his invitation-as well as any others that had slipped through the racial screen-would be withdrawn . <P> Also withdrawn-in the sense that he privately approved of these actions and passed the buck to the Chamber of Commerce-was Virginia 's weak-kneed Governor Thomas B. Stanley , who had co-signed the engraved invitations with a flourish . But many another white Southerner was highly offended at the breach of good manners . In an open letter to Governor Stanley , Virginia-born Lambert Davis , director of the University of North Carolina Press , wrote : " You have taken the ridiculous position of asserting , in effect , that being distinguished is an accomplishment possible only for people of Caucasian ancestry . You have succeeded in making the leadership of the Commonwealth both a stench and a laughingstock in the nation . I believe that I can best show my loyalty to the great traditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginius Dabney of the segregationist Richmond Times-Dispatch : " If any of these invited colored citizens come to the dinner . . . and admission is refused , Virginia and Virginia hospitality will get a black eye from which they may never recover . " With all this said and done , the Chamber of Commerce mended its anniversary manners , announced that any invited Negro who showed up at the reception would be " courteously seated . "
