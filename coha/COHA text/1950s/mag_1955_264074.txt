Dear Time-Reader : One of the great means of mass communication in these times is the institution known as the convention . Every year some 10 million Americans go to conventions to exchange ideas , thresh out problems , see new products , hear of new discoveries . <P> TIME is represented at many of these conventions , particularly at the trade shows and industrial meetings . Our reason , too , is communication : we want to show the conventioneers something of TIME 'S own operations , and how we function as an advertising medium . <P> On the average of once a month our Merchandising Director Briscoe ( " Beezer " ) Ranson crates up his exhibits , alerts his truckers and carpenters , and sets out to tell TIME 'S story to some major gathering . Different conventions call for different types of exhibits . At one convention of retail clothiers , for example , our exhibit was labeled " Mr. TIME 'S Bedroom . " It was simply a bedroom containing the precise number of hats ( 3 ) , shoes ( 6 pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the average male reader of TIME . The articles displayed were , of course , those of TIME advertisers . On top of the wellstocked bureau was a wallet . The wallet was the key to this exhibit . Visitors were supposed to guess the amount of cash the average TIME reader carries in his pocket at any given time . ( Correct answer : $30.70 . ) <P> One of our recent sales-convention eye catchers is a large electrically controlled panel that looks like a cross between an electronic calculator and a mammoth pinball machine . It is called " The TIME Visualizer . " Its aim is to demonstrate how TIME reaches top executives and management in almost any company in practically any industry you can name-and it does so graphically , by means of flashing lights , bouncing colored marbles and glass tubes full of bubbling liquid . <P> Another exhibit is used to demonstrate TIME 'S broad readership . This is our Post Office Booth , where we have a file of the names and addresses of all U.S. TIME subscribers broken down by states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list of our subscribers in their own home towns . Usually they are challenged to name a post office anywhere in the U.S. which does not have at least one TIME subscriber . If by chance they can do so , they get a prize of a silver dollar . <P> Sometimes we have to pay off , but I am glad to say not very often . <P> Cordially yours , <P> James A.
