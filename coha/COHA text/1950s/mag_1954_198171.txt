THE WORKS OF OSCAR WILDE ( 1,119 pp. ) - Edited by G. F. Maine-Dutton ( $4.95 ) . <P> Like many another dashing Irishman , from Swift to George Bernard Shaw , Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde deemed it his destiny to invade England and take London by storm . He succeeded in fulfilling this destiny because he knew that though Britons never yield to force , they are ready to surrender the Bank of England itself to a man who can make them laugh . <P> His literary conquests are , perhaps , not over . Right now , Wilde is having something of a publishing renaissance in the U.S. In addition to this one-volume edition of Wilde 's collected works , bookstores offer a collection of his bright sayings ( The Epigrams of Oscar Wilde ; John Day ; $4 ) and a half-personal , half-literary memoir by his son , who took the name Vyvyan Holland ( Son of Oscar Wilde ; Dutton ; $3.75 ) . All of these anticipate the centenary of Wilde 's birth ( 1856 ) . Is he worth rereading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth at least re-browsing . <P> Soapbox Y. Salon . It is startling to recall that Wilde , whose works read like period pieces , and Shaw , whose works seem almost contemporary , were born in the same year . Shaw proved more durable : he grew old enough to reach his second childhood , while Wilde never quite outgrew his first . Yet , like Shaw , Wilde resembled a fountain of social defiance . Both men were socialists , both loved to confound and educate their audiences with startling paradoxes , both were masters of clear , succinct prose . One of the many major differences between them was that Shaw believed style to be a byproduct of sincerity , while Wilde insisted that style alone could create sincerity . It was in Shaw 's nature to be a teetotaler , to dress in all the sincerity of rough Jaeger woolens , to stand on a soapbox and preach rebellion in pouring rain . Wilde made it his duty to be " a flaneur , a dandy , a man of fashion , " and to preach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said bluntly : " All great truths begin as blasphemies , " while Wilde remarked , with his lips ever so lightly curled : " If one tells the truth , one is sure , sooner or later , to be found out . " <P> Of all Wilde 's works , the comedies stand up best ( The Importance of Being Earnest , A Woman of No Importance ) . It is still impossible not to smile when Wilde seizes upon some normally dismal aspect of human relations and translates it faithfully and accurately into the language of comedy . It is this most-human humor that is Wilde 's greatest gift to English literature . Much as he loved to pretend that he was too detached an artist to have " sympathies , " every word he wrote shows that he was much too softhearted ( and not really intelligent enough ) to possess the large hatreds of a Swift or the noisy spites of a Sean O'Casey . If his plays date , it is not because the humor has gone bad , but because the plots are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Yet even the least playable plays and the least readable stories are full of the sparklers that Wilde could not help scattering all over the place , like a fairytale character who sneezes diamonds instead of germs . These fragments of Wilde 's work will probably outlive the whole . Some typical Wilde shots :
