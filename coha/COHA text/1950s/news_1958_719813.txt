txt A key Republican has raised the question of whether the Eisenhower administration 's broad policies will be endangered in the immediate future by the retention of Sherman Adams . Hard-pressed in his race for the California governorship , Senator William F. Knowland , leader of the Republicans in the Senate , was asked if Mr. Adams J should quit . He replied : " I think this is something which the President and Governor Adams should carefully weigh as to whether Adams has so hurt his usefulness that it . might be harmful to the broad policies which the President must carry out in the remaining two years of his administration . " ! President Landed This argument is calculated to strike the President closer home than the complaint of Republicans that Mr. Adams ' continuance in the White House will be a political liability to the Republicans in the 1958 and 1960 elections . The White House may find some irony in this statement from a senator who has not always gone along with the President on key issues . But it is unlikely the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retention of Mr. Adams would only borrow more trouble on Capitol Hill . The President undoubtedly found more reassuring the statement of four senators who have gone along with Mr. Eisenhower 's program more frequently than Senator Knowland . Senator George D. Aiken of Vermont , Frank Carlson of Kansas , Ralph E. Flanders of Vermont , and Jacob Javits of New York commended the President for not being " stampeded " into letting Mr. Adams go . They said that Mr. Adams " may have made mistakes in judgment , " but that he " should now be given a chance to do his job , " Liability ' Seen This stand , however , was widely discounted here as an opinion pace setter for the Republicans . None of the four senators is up for reelection this year . Republicans facing the voters this fall who have thus far spoken up continue to call for Mr. Adams ' removal . One Republican congressional candidate in Newark , N.J. , John r ' . Lanagan , said he would submit his resignation as a candidate if Mr. Adams remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " too great a liability to carry . " Senator Charles E. Potter ( R ) of Michigan , who o is not expected to have an easy time of it at the voting booths this fall , again called for Mr. Adams ' resignation . He was joined by two GOP congressmen not heard from before ; Representative Charles E. Chamberlain of Michigan and Harry G. Haskell , jr. , of Delaware . and left the conference almost as soon as it started . Senator Payne , who received , as did Mr. Adams , a vicuna coat from Mr. Goldfine said he performed only the type of routine service he would for any constituent . In ' Mr. Adams ' opinion , as given in his testimony to the House subcommittee on legislative oversight , almost everyone in Washington is engaged in serving citizens who come to his office , While not approving the contacting by congressmen of federal regulatory agencies , which have been placed in a semijudicial status by Congress itself , some congressmen draw a sharp distinction between congressional and White House contacts . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an elected official who has constituents . If he attempted to take on all those of his immediate superior , his office would be a 24-hour Grand Central Terminal rush . Second , the voice of one congressman from among the 435 representatives and 96 senators is not likely to be heeded by agency officials as quickly as that of the powerful . White House . Payne Tells of Aid In terms of headlines , the administration made sonic ground during the last 24 hours with its argtunent that congressmen were in a poor posture to criticize Mr. Adams ' contacting of federal regulatory agencies for Bernard Goldfine , Massachusetts textile magnate . Senator Frederick G. Payne ( R ) of Maine said that in 1956 he had arranged for an attorney of Mr. Goldfine to obtain information involving one of Mr. Goldfine 's companies . According to Senator Payne , he discussed the ease at a conference with an SEC attorney , Mr. Goldfine 's attorney , and Senator Norris Cotton ( ft ) of New Hampshire .
