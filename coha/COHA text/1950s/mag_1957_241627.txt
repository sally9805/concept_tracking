LONG before Sputnik soared into its orbit , TIME 's editors and correspondents had been exploring the fascinating vistas and terrifying dangers of space travel , missile war , and the scientific and technological resources that make them possible . Along with countless week-to-week stories , TIME took its first full-length journey into space five years ago with a cover story on the Space Pioneer ( Dec. 8 , 1952 ) . In the following months the editors reported on the state of U.S. education in science , in the cover on California Institute of Technology President Lee DuBridge ( May 16 , 1955 ) ; on space medicine , with Colonel John Stapp ( Sept. 12 , 1955 ) ; on rocket guidance systems ( Jan. 30 , 1956 ) ; on the intercontinental ballistics missile program , with the Air Force 's Major General Bernard Schriever ( April 1 , 1957 ) ; and on the fabulous new industry supporting missile production , in the cover on California 's Ramo Wooldridge Corp . ( April 29 , 1957 ) . After Sputnik . TIME correspondents went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , as the scientists themselves see it .

" Both a puzzle and a fascination to their professors , today 's college students have earned a new nickname . See EDUCATION . The No-Nonsense Kids .
