Died . Charles P. Skouras , 65 , one of the last of the great cinemoguls , president of the Fox West Coast Theaters chain and of National Theaters , Inc. ( totaling 650 theaters ) ; of a heart ailment ; in Los Angeles . Son of a Greek farmer , dynamic Charlie Skouras emigrated to the U.S. at 19 , slaved as a bus boy in a St. Louis hotel until he had saved enough ( in three years ) to send for brother Spyros ( now president of 20th Century-Fox ) and brother George ( now president of United Artists Theater Circuit ) . The brothers bought a nickelodeon in St. Louis in 1914 , with smart showmanship and incredible energy parlayed it into a coast-to-coast theater chain by the 1930s , became one of the most potent forces in moviedom . The triumvirate 's closely linked fortunes ( they even pooled their incomes , drawing what they needed from a common fund ) were partially severed in 1952 when 20th Century-Fox and the Skouras theater empire were divorced in a federal antitrust action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's top-salaried executive ( more than $800,000 a year before taxes ) , Charlie Skouras threw himself into public works with the same furious energy he lavished on his theaters , contributed to everything from Greek war relief to the Boy Scouts , almost single-handedly raised $2,000,000 for the construction of Los Angeles ' opulent Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral . <P> Died . George McManus , 70 , creator and chronicler ( in the comic strip Bringing Up Father ) of the nation 's most enduring ( over 41 years ) marital brawl ; of hepatitis ; in Santa Monica , Calif . McManus created the redhaired , button-nosed Jiggs and his strident , crockery-slinging wife Maggie in 1912 . The pair have battled in 27 different languages across the pages of some 750 newspapers . The strip 's gentle spoofing of America 's rags-to-riches-to-high society dream was translated into movies and radio shows , made a millionaire of Cartoonist McManus , who was regarded by his cronies as the spit &; image of Jiggs . <P> Died . Hugh Duffy , 87 , the heaviest hitter ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in Boston . Small ( 5 ft. 7 in. , 165 Ibs. in his prime ) , genial Outfielder Duffy batted a record .438 ( for which he got a $12.50-a-month pay boost ) while playing with the Boston Beaneaters ( National League ) in 1894 , compiled a .330 lifetime average . His record withstood the assaults of such great hitters as Willie Keeler ( .432 in 1897 ) and Rogers Hornsby ( .424 in 1924 ) , but Duffy modestly disclaimed any special knowledge of batting lore . " You just walk up there , " he said , " and hit it . " * <P> * Roughly comparable to the Ballet Russe 's late great Vaslav Nijinsky , who , asked how he made his incredible floating leaps , once explained : " You have just to go up and pause there a little .
