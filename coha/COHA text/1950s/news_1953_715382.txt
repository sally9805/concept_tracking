txt A new plan for the joint international financing of a vital part of the North Atlantic Treaty defense program over three years is reported to be under consideration at high levels in the alliance 's organization . The plan would call on each . of the fourteen nations in the Atlantic alliance to pledge itself  --  at least in principle  --  to pay an agreed share of a long-term defense building program in Europe to continue up to late 1956 . If this measure is accepted by the North Atlantic Council at its meeting here beginning April 23 , it will be the first time the Allies will have agreed in peacetime to finance jointly a defense program for a period of more than one year . The program of building joint military facilities in Europe , which the five Brussels Treaty allies ? Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , Britain and France -- started in 1948 , is now about half way toward completion . By the time it is completed in 1956 or 1957 it will have cost at least $2,000,000,000 , U. S. Pays About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 , has spent so far about 40 per cent of the total or in the neighborhood of $450,000,000 . In addition the United States is building facilities for its own forces on the Continent . The basic reasons for the plan now reported to be under consideration at the Atlantic alliance headquarters are said to be to keep the defense building program moving forward efficiently ; to give Allied military experts a firm foundation for programming future troop levels and facilities , and to let each member Government know , in advance of establishing its budget , what its share of the cost of fixed installations will be each year . Since the United States agreed at successive conferences of the Atlantic Council to shoulder about 40 per cent of each phase of the long-term building program , it may be asked to continue the principle of providing approximately this same share until 1956 . In view of the 40 per cent investment by the United States , Canada and the European members of the alliance agreed to shoulder among them the remaining 60 per cent or a sum estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if slow , progress being made in creating the defensive necessities across West Europe , leaders of the alliance have increasingly felt the need for a long-term financing program that would avoid the " fits and starts " characterizing the common allied financing in the last two years . There has developed an almost morbid loathing of the inter-Allied " haggling " that has taken place behind locked doors at succeeding Atlantic pact meetings . One expert witness said the finance ministers had hedged and bargained at their meetings and belatedly had agreed to pay some final fraction needed to round out the sum vital to the military defense plans . " It is degrading for free allies to come together three ' times a year and bargain like a lot of rug merchants as to w : . o contributes 2 per cent or 1.5 per cent for our own safety , " a leader of the alliance said not long ago . " We waste time ; this is not efficient . We must know now , broadly , who is to do what and then we can plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction of the United States Congress to the plan in question is said to be one of the unknown factors confronting it . Ambassador William H. Draper Jr. , United States representative on the North Atlantic Council , has been in Washington discussing the project with Administration leaders . Mr. Draper , with General of the Army Omar N. Bradley , chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff , left for Paris Tuesday to attend the Atlantic Alliance session , The Associated Press said . Allied leaders are said to know full well that Congress has not hitherto agreed to a United States contribution to any program  --  domestic or external  --  that would commit the Legislature for more than one year ahead . However , leaders of the alliance here feel that Congress may approve the plan since the needs of European defense are a cardinal factor in , United States foreign policy ands the Eisenhower Administration is as well informed on these needs as any United States Government can be . They also point to the four-year Marshall Plan as a precedent for the approval of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some long-term , cost-sharing formula can be adopted at the coming Atlantic Council meeting , the momentum of the European defense effort may slacken , particularly in view of the Soviet " peace " moves . " Orderly long range planning is impossible the way things stand now , " one specialist explained . " There are , for instance , four different sets of fiscal year periods among the fourteen NATO countries : the United States , Italy , Norway and Greece follow one ; France , Belgium , the Netherlands , Portugal , Iceland and Luxembourg another ; Britain , Canada and Denmark , a third and Turkey has her own . 1 " By the time the NATO Ministers meet to agree on each successive phase of the building program and on which country will pay what percentage , most of the Governments have already made their budgets up " he continued . " They have not included this cost since they have had no way of knowing how much it would be . So the new burden throws all their plans out  --  and it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atiantic council members , particularly the United States , accept a long-term financing project , it will mean that cost of the rest of the three-year building program will be shared approximately as follows : The United States will pay about $280.000,00 Britain and France together about $175,00,000 , and nine other countries ( excluding Portugal and Iceland ) each will pay an average of about $20,000 , - 000.
