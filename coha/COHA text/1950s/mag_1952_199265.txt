In the Southwest , cattlemen wage a relentless war against mesquite , a ragged , bushlike tree . It chokes out the grazing grass , hides cattle at roundup time . Cattlemen have attacked it with fire , bulldozer and assorted chemicals . But it more than holds its own . Texas and Oklahoma alone have an estimated 71 million acres of it . Last week Dow Chemical Co. announced that , after three years of intensive testing , it had a chemical that could win the mesquite war . The killer : 2,4,5-T ( short for trichlorophenoxyacetic acid ) . <P> The man who has done most of the testing of 2,4,5-T is Texas State Agronomist Charles Fisher . Back in 1938 , Texas agriculture officials gave Fisher his assignment : learn how to kill mesquite . " They gave me $300 , a team of mules , a wagon and a hand to help me one day a week , " said Fisher . " We went through everything . At the start it was the old hand grubbing . That just cost too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it still cost too much . Then heavy-gear machinery and bulldozers . They cost too much , too . " <P> During the war years , chemists from outside the state began taking notice of Fisher 's experimental substation near Lubbock . The first sample of 2,4,5-T for tests on mesquite ( " just enough to put in your hat " ) was delivered to him in 1945 by Dow Chemical Co . Later American Chemical Paint , which holds the original patent on 2,4,5-T , and Du Pont joined in . Today all three firms manufacture the chemical . Fisher started testing it on 80 five-acre plots , went on to larger areas which he sprayed from a plane at leafing time . In three to ten days , the leaves yellowed . The following year the mesquite failed to leaf again , but grass underneath the mesquite was not affected . Spraying with 2,4,5-T is inexpensive : $3.50 to $4 an acre . Last year , experiments on 300,000 acres were so successful that Fisher and staff propose to spray 1,000,000 acres this year .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
