Each day a knot of government men , Red Cross representatives , and journalists gather at the Hong Kong border of Red China to watch for freed prisoners who straggle across from the tiny Chinese border town of Shumchun . By now , the watchers are accustomed to the look left by long imprisonment and hammering interrogation , the attrition of hunger , worry and disease . But they were still shocked by one figure that came from behind the barbed wire . Dressed in a black Chinese gown and tattered brown cap , Roman Catholic Bishop Alfonso Maria Corrado Ferroni looked dazedly out at the free world with eyes that seemed set in a skull . <P> Two men rushed forward to carry him , and their burden was light ; Bishop Ferroni had wasted from 150 Ibs. to only 70 Ibs . In the hospital , the 63-year-old Italian Franciscan , who first came to China in 1922 , was too weak to tell a coherent story . " Communist radio , " he mumbled . " Lamps and loudspeakers . . . for days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's beard had been partly plucked out ; there were blood clots under the skin on his hands , and his wrists bore the marks of manacles . " I told them , ' My thoughts are my own , and you will not change them , ' " he whispered later . " They failed . I would never change my mind . " <P> According to Spanish Jesuit Father Louis R. Bolumburn , also deported last week on his 22nd anniversary in China , the Communists have launched a new drive against the Roman Catholic Church . Arrested three weeks ago with three of his Chinese priests , Father Bolumburn heard that at least 23 Chinese priests and some 300 leading Catholic laymen had been jailed in the Shanghai area alone in a single week as counterrevolutionaries . Catholic congregations in Shanghai , he said , have attended church as faithfully as ever , " not because there is religious freedom in Communist China , but because the Catholics are courageous .
