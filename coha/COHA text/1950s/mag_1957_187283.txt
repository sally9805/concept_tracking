Under Milk Wood ( by Dylan Thomas ) has progressed from a radio show to a stage reading to a full-fledged theater piece . Except that the theater piece does not represent progress . A poet who is a magician , if also a wastrel , with words has been contorted into a playwright whose figures are made to skitter and bray and strike deliberate ham attitudes . As staged by Douglas Cleverdon . Dylan Thomas 's picture of a Welsh community , at once full of local flavor and universal types , has pretty much become a variety show . Atmosphere , which should plainly come first , now plays second fiddle to antics . <P> If Thomas , during his last years , was on the way to turning playwright , he had not yet learned in Under Milk Wood that an overplus of words is dangerous in the theater , that many small verbal victories can spell theatrical defeat . But it is extremely doubtful that in Under Milk Wood Thomas intended to be primarily a playwright ; as a radio or reading piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It uses words as incantation , as portrait or landscape or genre painting , for a caught moment or an animated cartoon . Unlike Thornton Wilder 's Our Town , it lacks even allegorical plot progression or a central group of characters . Not its world but its words are dynamic . <P> Moreover , Director Cleverdon has sought to give it visual stage life not as a kind of ballet but as a type of vaudeville . Yet the more vigorously Under Milk Wood is acted , the clearer it becomes that - despite lively moments-there is no real action . More dubiously still , the acting is self-consciously lowbrow , a mock ten-twent-thirt suggesting the beer-and-pretzel revivals of old melodramas in the 1930s . But in a work where the rich , lush language is itself almost too much of a good thing , such shenanigans first of all prove excessive , and secondly , ill-mated , like pretzels and wine . Under Milk Wood has still its sudden rushes of light , its lunges of fun , its elegiac , sea-washed moods . But the production , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halving it .
