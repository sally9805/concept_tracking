txt ALLIES SAY SOVIET SUPPLIES WEAPONS TO ENEMY IN KOREA Ridgway Headquarters Issues Official List of Arms Used by Reds Since Start of War DOUBTS VOICED ON TRUCE General Assails Communists ' Armistice Delegates for Use of ' Known Falsehoods ' By LINDESAY PARROTT Special to THE Haw Tors Timm . TOKYO , Tuesday , March 11 ? The Soviet Union has armed or Is arming both the North Korean and Chinese forces facing the United Nations in Korea with a wide variety of weapons , the headquarters of Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway said yesterday . This statement was issued by the United Nations Command as the Communists at Panmunjom pressed for the inclusion of Russia as one of the " neutral " nations to police the armistice on the peninsula . While it has been known for sometime that North Korean troops began the invasion of the Korean Republic with Soviet tanks and guns , it had not been officially announced previously that the Chinese also drew upon Russian arsenals . While the statement issued through General Ridgway 's Public Information Office made no specific mention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong evidence why the United Nations delegates had refused to concede Soviet neutrality in the Korean war . Meanwhile , General Ridgway denounced the Communists ' armistice delegation , and the Communist propaganda machine for einp/oying " known falsehoods . " Visiting lice Admiral Charles Turner Joy , senior Allied truce delegate , and Gen. James A. Van Fleet , Eighth Army Commander , in Korea , General Ridgway declared the cease-fire negotiations had reac6ed a state at which it was impossible for him to guess what would happen next . ' Not a Scintilla of Truth ' The United Nations commander told correspondents that there was " not a scintilla of truth " in charges broadcast by the Peiping radio that the United Nations had used bacteriological weapons in Korea . ' The Communists ' statements on bacteriological warfare are completely , absolutely and categorically false , " he said . The general added that information had come to him of bubonic plague in North Korea . He said the Communists might be talking of germ warfare " in order to cover up their own epidemics . " His visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his routine inspections and had no special significance . The formal accounting of Soviet armaments in Korea came as the truce conferences bogged down in an angry argument over enemy charges of mistreatment of prisoners in United Nations stockades . The rough talk of the last few'days reached a climax yesterday when Rear Admiral Ruthven E. Libby , senior United Nations delegate on the subcommittee discussing a prisoner exchange , put the Communists on notice that the Allied representatives would listen to no // rain and " more than adequate " for close infantry support purposes . " The . 122mm. howitzer , model 1938 , is a very effective weapon used generally for the same missions as the United States 155mm. howitzer ; and the 122mm. howitzer , model 1931-1937 , is a powerful long-range weapon normally employed in roles similar to those of , the United States Corps Artillery , " headquarters said . further " fabricated " accusations . " I am not going to sit and listen to that tripe , " ' Admiral Libby said . jut get up and walk out . " Later the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the helicopter that flew ljrn back to the delegatioTes advance camp , explained he had : not meant the conferences wouti be broken off if the enemy delegation repeated its tactics of abuse . " We will get up and recess until twenty-four hours later , " he explained . " Of course , we have to listen to their opinions , but there is a limit . " The headquarters announcement of the extent of Soviet arming of the Chinese and North Korean forces made it plain that the charge was based upon the evidence of captured materiel or of positive identification of many types of weapons . Communist forces ' armies utilize Soviet ordnance materiel in the present Korean conflict , " the release said . " With the exception of a small amount of Japanese materiel left over from the Japanese occupation of Korea and Manchuria and materiel captured from United Nations forces in Korea the North Korean Army has been entirely equipped ' and/or re-equipped with Soviet materiel . " This has not been true in the case of the Chinese Communist forces . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Korea it was armed with a heterogeneous collection of arms from many countries . Recent reports , however , have shown that the main source of supply for the present Chinese Communist forces ' equipping and/or re-equipping of units in Korea or earmarked for Korea is Sovietfurnished materiel . Soviet Jets Not Mentioned The statement made no mention of MIG jet fighters based in Manchuria that are known to be of Russian design . But it identified as Soviet weapons used by both the Chinese and North Korean tanks , armored cars , self-propelled guns , trucks , field and anti-aircraft artillery , as well as mortars and many types of infantry arms . Previously , there had been a considerable number of reports that at least some of  --  the more complicated of these weapons might be manned by " Caucasian " technicians . Most of the Soviet materiel captured or identified in Korea , the headquarters said , was not obsolete surplus . While some of the Russian artillery pieces are outdated , they have proved highly effective under the conditions existing in Korea . With few exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recent enough manufacture and design to be more than adequate to meet modern warfare require-1 ments . " " While some small part of the ordnance has been manufactured in North Korea proper , the vast majority ha : , come from either Russia or her satellite countries , " the release added . Soviet Arms Listed Specified among the Soviet weapons was the T-34 tank , mounting an 85min. gun . This was the principal combat vehicle of the Soviet Army during World War U. Also specified were the BA-64 armored car and the SU 76 mm. gun mounted on a tank chassis . The Soviet artillery is represented by 45mm. and 57mm. anti-tank guns characterized as effective against armor at short range or in close support of infantry . The 37mm. and 85mm. anti-aircraft guns from the Soviet Union " are of recent enough design and manufacture to be effective antiaircraft weapons , " the release said . In the line of Russian field artillery weapons identified in Korea , headquarters said were 76mm. rifles and 74mm. howitzers and 122JPm. howitzers . The first two are of antiquated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines
