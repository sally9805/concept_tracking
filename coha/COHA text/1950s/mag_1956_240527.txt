" There 's a difference in amateur and pro tennis just too great to explain , " said Tony Trabert . " My game is at least 25% better than it was when I was an amateur - and still I lose . " <P> Under the glaring lights of Atlanta 's Municipal Auditorium last week , last year 's amateur tennis champion looked as bewildered as he sounded . Handsome Tony Trabert , 25 , was still learning the difference between playing for pay and playing for polite applause . Pro Champion Richard ( " Pancho " ) Gonzales , 27 , polished him off with ease ( 6-1 , 11-9 ) , making it Pancho 's 51st victory of the 66 matches played so far in their 100-match tour . The victory earned Pancho a $25,000 bonus as well as the assurance of a place on next year 's tour . It also may have been the beginning of the end of Tony Trabert 's brief pro career .                   @ @
