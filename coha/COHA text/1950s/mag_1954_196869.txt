Preaching was once the beating heart of Protestantism . John Knox could hold a congregation rapt and on its feet for three hours , and Jonathan Edwards used to keep the attention of New England Congregationalists for a good two hours at a stretch . Today the model of a modern minister is expected to occupy the pulpit for a scant 20 minutes of a Sunday and put in hours on end as an amateur psychiatrist , sociologist and group-activities organizer . Yet there are still a few top-notch preachers around to keep the Protestant tradition alive . <P> One of them is Dr. James T. Cleland , professor of preaching at Duke University Divinity School and preacher to the university . Last year Dr. Cleland delivered the first Frederic Rogers Kellogg lectures at the Cambridge ( Mass . ) Episcopal Theological School . His subject : preaching . Last week the lectures were published under the title . The True and Lively Word ( Scribner ; $2.50 ) . " They are offered . " writes Cleland in his fore word , " as an ecumenical gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke for Methodists . " <P> " Na1 Gud Enough . " Preacher Cleland , 50. is a rugged , grizzle-headed Scot whose deep-set eyes seem to be laughing most of the time . When it is announced that he will be preaching at the Duke chapel , students , faculty members and townsfolk get there 30 minutes early . They come to hear a man who uses his high-pitched voice like a musical instrument , whose rhythm , range and change of pace are far beyond the capabilities of mine-run preachers . But even more , they come to hear a man who uses his head and heart . <P> <P> " It is when the minister sees the Christian world view penetrating an immediately relevant human situation , " he writes , " that a sermon is born . " Cleland finds his " relevant human situations " wherever he happens to be ; his sermons to Duke students are likely to take off from yesterday 's classroom , last night 's fraternity dance or Saturday 's basketball game . They are peppered with anecdotes , delivered with fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> He likes to tell of the time he was invited to pinch-hit for a speaker at a Lincoln Day celebration and offered $250 and expenses . He wired back : " I do n't know that much about Lincoln . " Then , he says : ' T studied up a bit on Lincoln hoping they 'd ask me back , but they never did . " A few years ago . when he was invited to be a summer guest preacher at famed Wellington Church in his home city of Glasgow , he jubilantly wrote his mother the news . " Dear Jamie. " she replied , " accept the honor but decline the invitation . You are na ' gud enough . " <P> Graciousness &; Charm . Dean James Cannon of the Duke Divinity School is sure " that no one anywhere is doing as good a job as is Professor Cleland in teaching the art of preaching to young ministers . " But Cleland 's ministry does not end there . His door is always open to everyone asking advice , and many do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups ; he is booked up for commencement addresses for the next five years .
