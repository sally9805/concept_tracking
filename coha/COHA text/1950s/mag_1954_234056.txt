When Novelist-Anthropologist Oliver ( Laughing Boy ) La Farge wrote his autobiography at 43 , he had some sharp words to say . about U.S. private prep schools , and Groton in particular . Such places , said he , are " grindingly conformist . " Last week , in the Atlantic Monthly , La Farge , now 52 , announced a change of heart . <P> After more years of teaching and lecturing ( mostly at the universities of Utah and New Mexico ) and meeting the products of U.S. public education , he has come to the conclusion that-former President Conant of Harvard to the contrary-we need private schools . . . <P> " Only recently , " says La Farge , " it has become apparent to me that a great many schools . . . fail to provide that most fundamental thing of all , an education . " In France , during World War II , " it was startling to find that , among the thousands of American college graduates , officers , who were dumped there , the one who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I made a point of asking as many of these men as possible how it was that they had no French , when they must have had to ' present ' it to enter college . The answer was always the same , and usually in the same words : ' I took three years of French in high school . . . Then I just forgot it . ' That is as pretty an example of schooling without education as one can find ... " Pure Horror . " More recently , through teaching and lecturing , I came into contact with the Western undergraduate , who typically has entered college on a high-school certificate ... In a class of 30 , at least 15 will dread what they call ' essay exams ' ... A quiz of ten questions requiring answers averaging 50 words apiece is feared ; a major examination question , calling for several pages of answer , is a pure horror . The reason for this is clear in their contorted faces as they put pen to paper . . . They are semiliterate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not write . They can not spell , punctuation is quite beyond them , the mere formation of a written word troubles them . . . <P> " In these classes one finds , also , a resist ance to any discussion that roams beyond the literal confines of the subject . In teaching general anthropology , the teacher can feel that he is losing some of the class if he refers to Babbitt or to Shakespeare , or speaks of the urban modernism of Rome as shown in Horace 's Satires . ( A good part of the class will never have heard of Horace . ) . . . There is a definite resistance to erudition as such . . . The teacher tends to narrow his presentation . . . He can not assume that he and the class have any common points of reference arising from voluntary reading . The result is that he is inclined to give an inferior course , lacking in depth . " <P> Dreadful Theory . Too many people , says La Farge , insist that such evidences of non-education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic school system . This " is a form of insistence that all be held down to a level , rather than . . . trying to raise all to a level . " Nonetheless , " parents can get a superior education for their children in private schools . . . Like owning a Cadillac or wearing tailor-made clothes , the superior education costs money . . . But in our democracy there is nothing against buying something better if you can afford it .
