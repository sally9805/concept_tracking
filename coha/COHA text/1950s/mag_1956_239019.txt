WITH leading European artists already branching out into ceramics , stained glass and tapestries , it was only a question of time before their art would wind up on the floor . Last week Chicago 's Art Institute was offering a look at that brightly decked future : 13 limited-edition ( ten copies of each ) rugs designed by such artists as Pablo Picasso , Jon Mir , Jean Lurat , the late Fernand Lger and U.S. Mobile Sculptor Alexander Calder . <P> The artists ' prompter in this case was Manhattan Gallery Owner Madeleine Chalette-Lejwa , who commissioned their sketches , had them woven by Provenal weavers . Her one predictable surprise : Picasso had thought up the idea before her , had already designed a rug ( known as Alenon , for its type of weaving , but which he entitled The Keyhole ) to decorate the floor of his villa at Cannes . Well pleased with the first results , Madeleine Chalette-Lejwa is sure the idea will catch on . Says she : " In the old days art had a much more functional character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , and people ate out of plates and cups fashioned by artists . We decided to get prominent modern artists to design rugs which people could hang on the walls if they liked , or could actually put on the floor . " The price for Lger 's 7 ft. 7 in. by 3 ft. 9 in. #9 is $700 , for Mir 's Spanish Dancers $800 ; Picasso 's thick-piled 6 ft. 6 in. by 4 ft. 9 in. contribution costs an even $1,000.
