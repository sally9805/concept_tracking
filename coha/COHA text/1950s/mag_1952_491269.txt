LTHOUGH the Rev. Robert E. Richards , a lean , spring-muscled young man of twenty-five , is one of the country 's most extraordinary athletes , it may be that you have never of him . The Reverend Richards , a minister and college professor for the venerable Church of the , Brethren , more commonly known as the Dunker : - happens to be in a sport to which few people pay close attention . He is the best pole vaulter in the world and a strong contender for the world decathlon championship too . However , young Mr. Richards , whose first reputation was as a neighborhood toughie back in Champaign , Illinois , would be an interesting gent even if he had never put on a track suit . People who do attend the big track meets know him as the most colorful of performers . The pole-vaulting preacher is no poker face . His emotions are on spontaneous display for all to see . Watching him , the spectator almost feels as though he were straining up that pole with Richards . As Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear how desperately he wants to make it . If he does get over , he will whoop and dance with joy . If he misses , he will bang his fist into his palm , fling a handful of shavings from the vaulting pit , or otherwise express his disgust with himself . " He just refuses to be beaten , " says A. Richmond ( Boo ) Morcorn , a former vaulting star who is now in the Army . " He has the killer instinct . " This term may not seem appropriate for pole vaulting . Actually , it takes not only great skill but great determination and daring for a man to propel his body up over a crossbar placed as much as fifteen feet above the ground . It is a long way up and also a long way down . Making those last extra inches that decide championship meets often boils down to the old fighting spirit , as with the ball carrier who drives for that vital extra yard in a football game . Bob Richards throws himself intensely into everything . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church school in Virginia . Bob took issue one day with the professor and the rest of the students over a point under discussion in philosophy class . Finally Bob took the chalk from the professor 's hand , strode to the blackboard and spent the next few minutes graphically outlining his position . In dormitory bull sessions on religion , Bob often became locked in theological controversies with a classmate named Lloyd Gockenour . They would it there with their Bibles , hurling passages back and forth at each other . If Bob ran out of ammunition , he would take his Bible back to his room and pore over it for an hour or two hours , until he had rearmed himself . Then he would return to the fray . Even when Bob Richards was a frowned-upon youngster in Champaign , a leader in a gang of which five members later went to prison , he was a lad of undeniable gusto and energy . The energy has long since been redirected into constructive channels , but the gusto is unchanged . Bob wants to do more things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow gets them clone anyway . Heavy Workouts  --  Mental and Physical H E wants to be a top athlete , and exercises his body with heavy workouts of three hours or more , four or five days a week . He wants to be a top minister , and exercises his mind with heavy reading in religion , philosophy , sociology , psychology , anthropology , He delivers about 300 speeches and sermons a year . He is a faculty member at La Verne College , in Southern California , another Church of the Brethren school , where he teaches several philosophy courses . He is an adoring husband and father , with a wife and two small children to look after . Bob Richards tries never to waste a minute . If friends or visitors happen along at workout time , be will take them along to the athletic field and chat while he does his stuff . On long auto drives to track meet or speaking engagement , he has been known to prop a hook of verse on the steering wheel and , glancing down occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to play a round of golf , he combines conditioning with recreation . He runs , not walks , after each shot . Bubbling over as he does with joy of living and good will toward man , Bob Richards seems hugely popular with his students at La Verne College . He calls them all by their first names , insists that they call him Bob , kids around with them , volunteers advice on their personal problems . He is similarly Popular with the parishioners at 1 he churches he visits and with the many nonchurch groups he addresses . However , Bob Richards is not well liked by some of his contemporaries in the track world . They say they find his constant effervescence tiring . They deplore his " cockiness . " It is a fact that Bob talks freely about his athletic abilities . Friends say that this is simply a reflection of his completely candid nature . " He 's just being frank , " says one man . " He has no false modesty . It 's bragging when you make claims you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " As a freshman in 1944 at Bridgewater College , Which had no football team during the war years , Bob was holding forth one day to a group of upperclassmen on his achievements as a forward passer in high school . " All right , " said one of his listeners , pointing to the gymnasium entrance some twenty yards away , if you 're so hot , let 's see you hit the knob on that door . " Bob picked up a football  --  and hit the doorknob . " Luck , " the others chorused . Bob threw another one  --  and hit the doorknob again . Undefeated in Forty-six Starts D URING a conference track meet , Richards watched the javelin throwers warming up . Why , I 've never competed in the javelin in my life , but I could do better than those fellows , " he said . 80 the coach put him in the event . So he won it . Today Bob Richards has the same confidence that he can and will become the greatest pole vaulter in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new world 's record in that ten-event test of skill and endurance known as the decathlon , running up a score that defending Olympic Champion Bob Mathias will find hard to beat . In the pole vault , Richards went into the current indoor season undefeated in his last forty-six starts . He was tied twice during this stretch by Don Laz , of the University of Illinois . Richards already ranks as the second best vaulter of all time , next to Cornelius ( Dutch ) Warmerdam . Before Warmerdam , it was doubted that any pole vaulter would ever go as high as fifteen feet . Warmerdam proceeded to do it a total of forty-three times between 1940 and 1944 , setting an indoor record of fifteen feet , eight-and-ahalf inches and an outdoor record of fifteen feet , seven-and-three-quarters . Vaulters generally do better indoors . Outdoors , bad weather can hamper them . Richards up to this year had cleared fifteen feet on nine occasions , with a high of fifteen feet , four-and-. three-quarters . He intends to keep going until he has broken all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletics . When he preaches the character-building values of 8Ports to audiences of men and boys , he gives a new freshness to this somewhat tattered theme because he so obviously is speaking from experience and conviction . He also brings alive the little-appreciated sweat and guts and drama of his sport  --  how the top then punish themselves in going all out for victory . He tells how the pole vaulters in the 1948 Olympics Were straining so hard that five poles broke at fourteen feet ; how " old Mal Whitfield " won the 800-rneter race after vowing to run full-tilt until he dropped , no matter how severe the burning in his chest and the pain in his legs . In his speeches , Richards gives considerable in.1 -- eight into himself . He relates how he developed " an obsession to make fifteen feet in the pole vault " and kept at it until he did , on his sixty-fifth competitive attempt . " You learn in sports to set high goals for Yourself , " he declares earnestly . " You learn to give Yourself to a cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own ego and comPlexes . " ( Cont ed on Page 50 ) THAT BIG-TALKING , POLE-VAULTING PARSON ( Continued from Page 23 ) The significance of all this in Bob Richards ' life becomes clear when you talk to the Rev. Merlin E. Garber , an eager , open-hearted Church of the Brethren minister who has been a second father to Bob . It was at the Reverend Garber 's church in Champaign that Bob switched from rowdyism to religion . For a lengthy period Bob made his home with the Garbers . The two men still are very close , though Bob now lives in Southern California and the Reverend Garber has moved to a church in Roanoke , Virginia . " To understand Bob Richards , you must understand his background , " the Reverend Garber says . " He was the product of a broken home . He grew up in a section of Champaign on the wrong side of the tracks . He had a good father and a fine mother . But sometimes good people can be mismated . They can be hopelessly incompatible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mother and father stuck together for a long while for the sake of their children . Finally , when Bob was sixteen , the family split up . " No doubt this unstable childhood helped kindle Bob Richards ' burning desire to excel , in pole vaulting as in everything else he does . However , the athletic ability and interest were there all along . When he was eight , he could chin himself thirty times . He won a city-park tumbling contest for boys . He placed in the state Y.M.C.A. junior diving championships . He was a basketball player in junior high school and a star quarterback on the Champaign High School football team . Once he was called in as an emergency substitute on the junior-high wrestling team and won his match . He got started in pole vaulting in similar fashion . The junior-high track team had a meet coming up , and no pole vaulter . The coach asked twelve-year-old Bob Richards to try . As in the wrestling meet , he won , clearing the bar at six feet nine . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his house with a crossbar hooked up between a tree and a phone pole . It was not until he was twenty , however , that Bob decided to drop all other sports and concentrate on becoming a champion vaulter . Pole vaulting takes a rare combination of qualities . Bob Richards has all the natural equipment except height  --  six feet one or two is considered ideal , and Bob , a hard-knit 162-pounder , is only five ten . But he has the speed of a sprinter , to build up the necessary momentum during the take-off run . He has the co-ordination of an acrobat , to maneuver himself  --  in a fleeting second ? from a vertical position at the start of his vault to a virtual handstand at the top . He is strong and rugged , to withstand the physical pounding a vaulter takes both going up and coming down . Above all , Bob Richards has the willingness to work at vaulting , week in and week out , satisfied if a year 's hard effort raises his ceiling as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ceiling for three or four Margaret Richards . Only two members of the family are still in Champaign  --  the father , an electric-company lineman , who has remarried , and Bob 's oldest brother , Kenny , thirty , a telephone-cable splicer . Bob 's mother is living in Seattle . His second brother , Danny , twenty-eight  --  a crack golfer  --  is studying fine arts at La Verne College . His sister Shirley , twenty-three , is studying at Chicago 's Moody Bible Institute . Another sister , Lucille , died in 1946 . Bob says that the toughness of his early life has been exaggerated by some writers . " Last year a magazine said I was a dead-end kid . When my mother read that  --  wow ! There have been preachers on both sides of my family . My mother used to teach us prayers . But somehow religion did n't take with me at the time . I ran around with a gang , the way kids do . I suppose it was tougher than most gangs . We did a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get in a fight . But there was no criminality . I guess we were headed that way , though . Sometimes we 'd steal fruit , and things like that . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Afterward , five of the other fellows went to jail for a gas-station holdup . But they 're all out now . They were doing fine the last I heard . " The Richards family breakup came in 1943 , as Bob was finishing his junior year in high school . It was during this period that his religious conversion began . The starting point was Bob 's interest in a high-school classmate named Barbara Sayles . " She kept urging me to go to church , " he says . " She told me she wanted a Christian boy friend . I had n't been to church in ten years . One Sunday morning I was sitting in the living room at home , reading the comics and listening to the radio . All of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . I remembered the Church of the Brethren building I had often passed in the neighborhood . I got up and went right over there . I did n't even have a tie on , or any socks . " Merlin Garber , minister of the church , made the troubled sixteenyear-old feel more than welcome . When the high-school term ended in June , the Reverend Garber arranged for Bob to go to a church camp for several weeks . Then Bob went out to Seattle , where his mother and sisters had gone to join an older brother . Bob worked to play one more season of football at the high school that he returned in the fall to Champaign , where the Garbers invited him to live with them . The Reverend Garber has tried to help more than one youngster in this fashion , and not always with success . In Bob 's ease it all worked out . A father-and-son relationship developed between the minister and the boy , while Bob became like a big brother to the Garbers ' own two small children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Garbers ' , before dinner every evening , he was tutored in religion and related subjects . " He had a great intellectual awakening , " the Reverend Garber says . Richards now has as insatiable an appetite for serious reading and discussion as he has for athletics . In 1943 Bob became a licensed minister  --  a stage preliminary to ordination in the Church of the Brethren . In February of 1944 the Reverend Garber had him enter his old college in Bridgewater , Virginia . Bob Richards became a legend at Bridgewater College , not because he was phenomenal in any one thing ? that came later ? but because he could do so many things so well . In touch-football games , for instance , when he ran with the ball , it was seldom that anyone could lay a hand on him . He made the baseball team without half trying ; the track coach eventually persuaded him to give it up . In the small-college Mason-Dixon Conference track meet in 1945 , he was almost a one-man team , winning six events : the pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad jump , the high jump and  --  the first time he ever tried it  --  the javelin throw . However , Richards was not very popular his first year at Bridgewater . Many students considered him overasaertive , and he had a quick temper . " He 'd flare up at people , " says the Rev. Robert Houff , a Bridgewater classmate and friend of Richards and now a fellow minister . " Afterward he 'd be sorry . He 'd say , ' Gee , I wish I had n't done that . Do you think I should apologize ? ' " Richards and Houff were the stars of the basketball team . Bob had played little organized basketball before , but at Bridgewater he eventually averaged twenty-two points per game . Says Donald Clague , dean of the college , who coached basketball and some other sports at that time : " I 'd moan to other coaches about how little material I had during those war years . They 'd say , ' But you 've got Rich-ards ! ' " In 1945 Richards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournament , where they lost by four points to American University , the eventual winner . " It was all tied up until the last minute , and then Bob 's man sank two crazy long shots half the length of the floor  --  the kind you could n't possibly block , " Don Clague recalls . " But in the locker room after the game Bob broke down and cried . He blamed himself because we lost . " Costar Bob Houff remembers that Bob had to struggle with his temper in basketball . " Somebody would push him around or the referee would call a bad one , and I could see him starting to get red . But I 'd talk to him , and he 'd always fight it down . " They say that by his second year at Bridgewater , Bob Richards had mastered himself . He had learned how to get along with people . He was elected a national officer in the Brethren Student Christian Movement . At churches in the vicinity , he was one of the most highly regarded of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bridgewater , which is a coed school , he went around with a number of different girls . Eventually he settled upon Mary Leah Cline , of Vienna , Virginia , a niece of the president of the college . " He came home to us for a holiday , " Merlin Garber says , " and told us that he had heard her singing in church and that her voice had thrilled him . She was a beautiful brunette , refined and cultured . She had qualities which had not been present in his home . She was a queenly kind of person . " At the end of Bob 's second year it became financially possible for them to marry by switching to the University of Illinois , in Bob 's home town of Champaign . Both Bob and Mary got state senatorial scholarships to the university . Some members of the Bridgewater athletic staff are still bitter about this premature loss of their most outstanding athlete . However , the Illinois scholarships covered only tuition . The newlyweds managed because they could make their home with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as janitor of the church , at thirty-five dollars a month , and charged the young couple a nominal thirty dollars a month for board and room : Richards was invited to come out for both football and basketball at Illinois , but stuck exclusively to pole vaulting and studying . A B student at Bridgewater , he became an A student at Illinois . He won a philosophy scholarship which enabled him to continue an extra year and get his master 's degree . Bob blossomed out late as a pole vaulter . His best high-school mark had been twelve feet , and at Bridgewater his top competitive vault was thirteen feet . As an Illinois junior in 1946 , however , he got up to thirteen-eight to tie with Bill Moore , of Northwestern , for top height in the Chicago Relays . In 1947 he cleared fourteen feet for the first time , to win the pole vault in the annual Millrose Games at New York 's Madison Square Garden . By 1948 Richards was the top performer of the indoor season , and a leading prospect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympic tryouts , he came down with acute appendicitis and had to have an emergency operation . Before he was even out of his hospital bed , Bob was doing leg and arm exercises . He came back to qualify for the Olympic team , and , on a day when all contestants were hampered by a heavy rain , placed third in the finals at London , behind Guinn Smith , of California , and Erkki Kataja , of Finland . The next winter , Richards ranked just behind Boo Morcum , a University of New Hampshire product , on the indoor circuit . Then Morcum withdrew from competition . Richards has been the undisputed head man since . Bob has not lost a pole vault since the spring of 1949 , when he suffered two defeats in a row . Ironically , these losses came when he was altering his style after a week of special instruction from the old master , Cornelius Warmerdam , who is basketball coach and assistant track coach at Fresno State College , in California . But Warmerdam 's advice was helpful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar at what was supposed to be ( Continue ( ' on Page 60 ) 60 TILE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 19. 1952 4,111. - ( 1 from Page 58 ) fifteen feet  --  and then the officials rechecked and said it was n't fifteen feet after all . In Cleveland they found that they had put the bar on the wrong peg . In Helsinki , Finland , they decided that the ground at the take-off was a fraction of an inch too high . In the M ill-rose Games they discovered a slight sag in the crossbar and graded his height down to fourteen feet , eleven-a nd - a- hal f inches . Some opponents describe Richards as temperamental , but you could n't prove it . by his reaction to these disappointments . Each time , he was plunged from supreme elation to the depths of sorrow , but , made no protest to the officials . He just kept plugging away until at last , in the M illrose Games of 1951 , he did fifteen-one  --  the second man in history to go over fifteen feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year  --  Don Laz , of Illinois , and Don Cooper , of the University of Nebraska . Richerris made eight more , one of them at the Knights of Columbus meet in New York , just a few hours after he got off a plane from Buenos Aires , where he had won the pole vault in the Pan-American games . Bob Richards ' pole vaulting has taken him to arenas and stadiums all over the United States , and on seven tours to other lands . He also does considerable church traveling , holding Revival Weeks in different cities . He conducted about twenty of these last year . Sometimes he dovetails his preaching and track trips . Last winter , for example , he was staging a Revival Week at Merlin Garber 's church in Roanoke . On Friday night he flew up to New York , and competed on Saturday in Madison Square Garden . After the meet he arrived back in Roanoke in the small hours of the morning and spent the rest of the night preparing his sermon for Sunday . Richards has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing considerable preaching ever since he was ordained in 1946 , while still a student at Illinois . After Illinois he taught and did postgraduate work at Bethany Biblical Seminary , in Chicago . He returned to Illinois as a teaching assistant in the sociology department during the 1949-1950 college year . Around this time there was a period when , as he puts it , he began swinging over to " the humanistic view of life " and almost lost his religious faith . Ultimately he came to the conclusion that only Christianity can give meaning to life , and swung back to religion more strongly than ever . Bob 's church was started in this country in 1719 by a group which emigrated from Germany to Pennsylvania to escape religious persecution . They called themselves the German Baptist Brethren , but because of their baptismal rites , which involve triple immersion , they were widely referred to as the Dunkers . Then as now , the Church of the Brethren stressed simplicity and lack of ostentation . Its ministers today usually conduct services wearing plain business suits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is youthful and virile-looking , with brown curly hair ansf rugged features . His voice carries enthusiasm and sincerity . However , Richards is no hellfire-anddamnation evangelist of the Billy Graham type . Like his mentor , Merlin Garber , he believes that true religious conversion should be a reasoned as well las an emotional process . In his sermons he quotes widely not only from the Bible but from numerous nontheological works on human behavior and conduct . For all his serious-mindedness , Bob Richards does his share of laughing , some of it at himself . He jokes about his difficulties in journeying around with his vaulting pole , a sixteen-foot tubular-steel affair of recent American design , which he considers superior to bamboo , glass , aluminum or any other type . Anyway , whatever it is made of , a vaulting pole gives a man special travel problems . Some air lines wo n't take him . Taxi drivers all shy away from him . At best he must put his arm out the window and hold the pole alongside the cab . At worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the arena . Such inconveniences do not seem to faze Bob Richards , nor is he any prima donna about jumping conditions . Where some vaulters may fuss around for fifteen minutes or more before a jump until everything is to their liking , Bob just makes a quick inspection and then takes right off . At La Verne College , when he practices indoors , he has to vault up onto an elevated stage at one end of the small gymnasium . To get a full take-off run , he must open the front doors and start his run outside . But Bob finds La Verne 's Southern California climate ideal for year-around training . He also considers it a great place for his wife and children ? Carol Anne , three , and Bobby , Jr. , one and a half It is an affectionate household in which everybody seems to accept cheerfully the fact that daddy must he away from home a lot . They have television and the other standard middle-class comforts . Bob trades in his automobile every twelve months or less  --  driving around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40,000 miles a year . They live in an old frame house which Bob bought for $1000 , and on which he has done extensive remodeling . When the remodeling is complete , he plans to have the house moved bodily to an already-purchased lot . " I 'm going to wind up with a $20,000 home , " he says , " for a cost of only $6000 or $7000 . " Bob gets a salary of $2800 at La Verne , teaching during the first semester and rendering public-relations service the year around . He gets some additional income from his functions as a minister . He makes as much as $100 some months in speaking fees . And track stars invariably clear something on their expense allowances , although Bob is not among those who have been notoriously profess:onal about this . His total net income from all sources probably comes to no more than $5000 or $6000 a year . Recently the church invited him to take the post of Brotherhood Evangelist , in which his full-time duty would be to hold Revival Weeks throughout the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also to put in some time studying for a Ph.D . degree , on which he already has made a start at Illinois . If Bob does make this switch , it wo n't be until after the 1952 Olympics in Finland this summer . There he hopes to win both the pole-vault and the decathlon titles . He also aims to break the world pole-vault record , although not necessarily this year . When Bob is vaulting for top heights he starts his approach run 135 feet back from the uprights . At ninety feet his left foot must hit a check point to insure that he will ultimately leave the ground in proper stride . There is a severe impact as he slides the end of his pole into an eight-inch wooden slot at the base of the crossbar , and his forward momentum is transformed into upward momentum . He swings his body up and around , pushing off from the pole as he reaches the top . The pole falls back on the ground . Bob drops into a pit of wood shavings on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get his pole up almost at right angles with the ground , he will drop back on the hard ground ? or floor . Even the drop into the pit is quite a jolt . But a good vaulter never thinks about this . He is concerned only with getting up there . " Coming down seems automatic , " Bob Richards says . He invariably lands on his feet and rolls on his left side . In all his thousands of vaults , he has suffered nothing worse than a few ankle sprains , and those only when he hit bad spots in poorly tended pits . For most of his fifteen-foot vaults last year , Bob gripped his pole at a point thirteen feet , two inches from the base . To break the world 's record , he figures that he will have to raise his grip to thirteen feet , six inches . " Warmerdam held the pole at thirteen-ten , " Richards says . " He had a two-and-a-half-foot push-off at the top of his vault . Subtract eight inches for the box . That gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get a three-foot push-off . So if I can hold the pole at thirteen-six , I 'll make fifteen-ten . To do sixteen feet I 'd have to hold the pole at thirteen-eight . " A top vaulter is bound to be a good all-around athlete . Over the years Richards has tried his hand at various other track-and-field events , notably under the informal tutelage of Dr. Harold M. Osborn , 1924 Olympic decathlon champion , who , Bob says , has helped him more than any other coach . However , Bob never thought seriously of branching into the decathlon until last spring , when he had a speaking date at Muir College , in Pasadena , California . Muir was about to hold a decathlon , and they urged Bob to give a pole-vaulting exhibition during the meet . " I 'll do better than that , " he said . " I 'll enter the decathlon myself . " He did  --  and won with a fancy score of 7413 points . In another decathlon soon after he boosted his mark to 7517 . In July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total only two men have ever topped  --  Glenn Morris , the 1936 Olympic champion , and young Bob Mathias , of Stanford , the defending Olympic champion who holds the present world 's record of 8042 . Nowadays , in addition to his pole-vaulting and body conditioning , Bob Richards practices three or four decathlon events during each workout . He thinks he can build his score by Olympic time to 8500 points  --  but Mathias , he says , has a potential of 8600 points . In each decathlon event the competitors are graded against a " par " performance valued at 1000 points . Here is the score card Richards has set for himself : Event Have Can Points Done Do 100-meter run 10.9 10.8 902 Broad jump 22 ' 6 " 23 ' 801 Shot put 42 ' 3 " 44 ' 757 High jump 6 ' 6 ' 3 Yi " 924 400-meter run 51.8 50.3 850 110-meter hurdles 15.3 14.7 982 Discus 136 ' same 751 Pole vault 14 ' 9 " same 1138 Javelin 185 ' 200 ' 800 1500-meter run 4:56 4:35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not very often . He never prays for victory ? only for strength , and then only when he feels physically all played out . There was just one occasion , he says , when his prayers were not followed by a successful performance . That was in Chicago last March . After clearing fifteen feet , four-and-three-quarter inches , he told them to put the bar up to fifteen feet , eight-and-three-quarters , a fraction above Warmerdam 's indoor record . Completely exhausted from his previous jumps , he made one of his rare prayers for strength . " On my second try , " he relates , " I got my legs and body up over the bar , but my arm knocked it off on the way down . I did n't have enough faith . I did n't really expect to get up there . If I 'd had faith , I could have got my arm over too . " -
