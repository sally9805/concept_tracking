HARPOON VENTURE ( 304 pp. ) - Gavin Maxwell-Viking ( $4.75 ) . <P> <P> In a Hebrides bar , a grizzled trout fisherman turned to a young fellow in an old sweater and asked : " Any luck ? " <P> " Yes ... I got four , two large and two small . " <P> " What did your biggest weigh ? " <P> " I think he 'd be about six thousand pounds . " <P> The old fisherman was not having his leg pulled , as he huffily assumed . Gavin Maxwell , the young man in the sweater , was not a fisher of trout but of basking sharks-creatures " as large as a London bus , " that roam the bays and lochs of western Scotland . Harpoon Venture , Maxwell 's account of four years of shark-shooting , is a natural for vacation reading . But it also has a secondary theme that many people will find more interesting than the main one . <P> This theme is Gavin Maxwell 's personal history . In 1945 , aged 29 , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like many another veteran , he was dead set against living out the peace at a desk ; unlike most vets , he had a few thousand pounds of capital . He spent some of it to make one dream come true : he bought a small island in the Hebrides , with salmon rights and a commercial fishery . It was while exploring the neighboring waters of his little kingdom that he first saw " a ripple with a dark center " breaking the surface-a ripple that grew into " a huge fin , a yard high and as long at the base , " a " great black sail , the only visible thing upon limitless miles of pallid water . " <P> " My Dear Boy . " Maxwell knew nothing whatever about the basking shark . He fired more than 300 light machine-gun bullets into its hide-without apparent effect . Intrigued by such a doughty creature , Maxwell began to bone up on it . He found that though the basking shark 's liver is known to contain hundreds of pounds of valuable oil , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , in short , was a veteran 's dream , " an unexplored field , an amazing blank upon the . . . map of the world 's natural history . " <P> Maxwell sank the rest of his capital into building a shark factory on his island and buying war-surplus navy boats , gear and harpoons . Interested friends subscribed more money . He collected a crew consisting partly of local fishermen , partly of hard-boiled seadogs , whose language often depended solely upon " all the monosyllables . . . used in turn , as nouns , adjectives and adverbs . " Would-be adventurers clamored to join the project ; their letters often told an old familiar story : <P> " I 've only got 800 in the world , but I 'll put it all into your business if you 'll give me a job and keep me there . I thought the war was hell and I had a breakdown and then I looked forward to getting home . Now I 've got there , it 's back to a wife ... I never wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that young ; I 'm only 22 now . . . "
