txt 6o NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOREIGN POLICY much higher political returns than resort to all-out war . The importance of a strategy of intermediate objectives is now all the greater because of the changing nature of deterrence . The notion that deterrence can be achieved by only one of the two superpowers is no longer applicable , if it ever was . So long as the United States enjoyed an absolute atomic monopoly , even a small number of nuclear weapons exercised a powerful deterrent effect . Then we could protect many areas by the threat of massive retaliation . But , as the Soviet nuclear stockpile has grown , the American strategic problem has been transformed . No matter how vast our remaining margin in the number and refinement of weapons , henceforth not only they but we must fear them . In this situation deterrence can no longer be measured by absolute numbers of bombs or planes . To seek safety in numerical superiority , or even in superior destructiveness , may come close to a Maginotline mentality ? to seek in numbers a substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons system is already adequate to its mission , new technological advances will add much less to our effective strength than to that of the Soviet bloc . This seems to be true for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile and the atomic submarine . And when weapons can be made of any desired degree of destructiveness a point will be reached at which additional increments of destructive power yield diminishing returns . What is the sense in developing a weapon that can destroy a city twice over ? Thus for the first time in military history we are facing the prospect of a stalemate , despite the absolute superiority of one side in numbers of weapons and in their technology . It is a stalemate not so much in equality of power as in the assessment of risks ; an uneasy balance which shifts from region to region with the importance which the contenders attach to each and with the alternatives which their strategy and their weapons systems present them . To be sure , the key to survival is the possession of an adequate retaliatory force . Without a powerful Strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise attack does not exhaust the range of our THE DILEMMA OF AMERICAN SECURITY 6t perils ; although the greatest threat , it may , in fact , be the least likely danger . Mastery of the challenges of the nuclear age will depend on our ability to combine physical and psychological factors , to develop weapons systems which do not paralyze our will , and to devise strategies which permit us to shift the risks of counteraction to the other side . The pernicious aspect of the absence of doctrinal agreement among the services is that it tempts each of them to aim for absolute solutions in purely military terms . And it therefore inhibits the attempt to bridge the gap which has opened between power and the objectives for which power can be used . A revolution can not be mastered until it is understood . The temptation is always to seek to integrate it into fa . miliar doctrine : to deny that a revolution is taking place . Nothing is more important , therefore , than to attempt an assessment of the technological revolution which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its impact on our , by now , traditional concepts of surprise attack , deterrence , coalition policy , and all-out war . // FOR MANY CENTURIES , the legend of Prometheus , who sought to steal the secret of fire from the gods and who was punished by being forced to spend the rest of his life chained to a rock , has been the symbol of the penalties of presumptuous ambition . It was not understood that the punishment inflicted on Prometheus was an act of compassion ; it would have been a much more severe penalty had the gods permitted their fire to be stolen . Our generation has succeeded in stealing the fire of the gods and it is doomed to live with the horror of its achievement . Any examination of the strategic revolution brought about by nuclear technology must start from a discussion of the increased destructiveness of modern weapons . Since our strategic doctrine assumes that the targets will include industrial facilities , air bases , and ports , and since most of these are located in or near big cities , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when used against urban concentrations . The growth of the city is perhaps the distinguishing characteristic of modern civilization . It is the expression of its power and its vulnerability . In a primitive society the basic unit is the family which is largely self-sufficient , producing its own food supply and containing the skills required for its survival . Its margin of subsistence being generally low , it is more vulnerable to natural catastrophes which affect its food supply than to the actions of its neighbors . The modern city , on the other hand , is made possible by specialization . Because of it , the individual 65 // in modern society develops a substantially greater proficiency in his skill than his counterpart in primitive groups . By the same token , his dependence on other parts of the society becomes more pronounced . He is less vulnerable to natural catastrophes , but more vulnerable to events which affect the performance of his fellows . Specialization makes possible a greater degree of material well-being than is even conceivable in primitive societies . But it also defines the vulnerability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skilled population of a modern country will be found in cities . The leading hospitals and medical schools , many of the universities , the banks and credit institutions , and most of the exchanges which form the essential links of modern society are concentrated in cities . The city is thus the repository of a nation 's capital and skills . Any breakdown in one of the innumerable links of a city 's " nervous system " can produce paralysis : an elevator failure , a subway strike , even a stoppage of traffic signals , can materially slow down the economic machine . More serious still is a failure of essential supplies . The entire economic life of the city is dependent on the uninterrupted supply of energy , of which fuel energy is the single most important item . Above all , a city is held together by an intangible quality : the confidence of its inhabitants that the highly articulated mechanism will continue to function ; the conviction of the individual that the machine will serve and not destroy him . The highest expression of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intricate relationships which define a city could ever be destroyed . The penalty of a loss of confidence is illustrated by the depression of 1929 . The physical plant of our society did not shrink , the skills of the people did not grow less , yet production fell by more than 40 per cent and millions were unemployed . In planning for the contingency of an attack on our cities , the Federal Civil Defense Administration in 1955 made the following assumptions : ( I ) The U.S.S.R. has the capability of attacking any target within the United States with nuclear weapons , including thermonuclear types deTHE // livered through the air and detonated above ground , dur ing normal working hours . Its targets will be our centers of industry and population . ( 2 ) Initial attacks will include sufficient nuclear weapons to hit all of our critical target areas , to be followed by other less heavy attacks . ( 3 ) Bomb sizes will vary from a few thousand to millions of tons of TNT equivalent . Any city attacked , with very few ex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4 ) The principal city in each critical target area will be hit . The daytime centers of population will be the aiming points within the city . ( 5 ) Any city attacked will need out-side help to meet the emergency . ( 6 ) A warning time of one hour in most areas is expected but can not be guar anteed. ( 7 ) Evacuation of people from downtown areas in cities is to commence upon the first warning.l They are expected to have moved two miles from their offices by the time the attack becomes imminent . While some of these assumptions , particularly with re spect to evacuation , are now outdated , they suffice to describe the magnitude of the threat . The Federal Civil Defense Administration has identified 92 critical target areas with a total population of 68 million inhabitants . The Air Defense Command has described 170 standard metropolitan areas , each with a population of 50,000 or more . These areas contain 55 per cent of the population and 75 per cent of the industry of this country . An attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 per cent of the population , 50 per cent of the key facilities and 6o per cent of the industry of the United States.2 Nuclear technology , furthermore , has advanced to a point at which weapons of any desired explosive power // can be produced . The atomic bombs of the Hiroshima type now range from the equivalent of below i kiloton TNT equivalent ( or one-twentieth of the explosive power of the Hiroshima bomb ) to close to I million tons ( i mega-ton ) TNT equivalent ( or fifty times the explosive power of the Hiroshima bomb ) . Thermonuclear weapons have no inherent upper limit . The U.S.S.R. will , therefore , be able to attack each target with a weapon of whatever size is most suitable for its destruction . Since a Jo megaton weapon is by no means the most powerful weapon avail-able , a description of the damage caused by it will err , if at all , on the side of conservatism . The effects of such a weapon can be classed under three headings : blast and heat , radiation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast inflicted by a 10 mega-ton weapon would extend over three circles of decreasing damage . Within a radius of 3 miles there would occur total destruction of all buildings and a mortality rate of 75 per cent , with all the survivors severely injured . Within a radius of 7 miles , all buildings would be heavily dam-aged and the most conservative estimates indicate a mor tality rate of 3o per cent , with at least 40 per cent of the remainder injured to varying degrees of severity . Heavy damage is defined by the Federal Civil Defense Adminis tration as structural damage that would result in the col-lapse of buildings . Beyond this a circle of light damage would extend over a radius of to miles . At the outer edge of this circle , the heat and radiation would be sufficient to kill or injure severely individuals caught outside of shelters and to set fire to buildings . Since the suburbs of most American cities are constructed of wood , a devas tated city may find itself encircled by a wall of flames.3 The proportions of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded over New York City , at Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue , would in clude in its 3-mile radius of total destruction all of ManTHE // hattan south of Ninety-sixth Street , parts of Jersey City , all of the cities on the west bank of the Hudson up to Hudson Heights , as well as Queens , Long Island City , Hunter 's Point and Williamsburg . The daytime working and resi dential population in this area amounts to at least 4 mil-lion . A mortality rate of 75 per cent would produce 3 million deaths , and the remainder would be so severely in jured that they could survive only if hospitalized immedi ately . The 7-mile radius of heavy damage would include Manhattan Island to just north of the George Washington Bridge , a third of the Bronx , half of Queens and Brook lyn and all of Jersey City . A conservative estimate of cas ualities in this area would be 900,000 dead and at least 600,000 injured . To be sure , New York is more vulnerable than most cities because of its great density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large unpopulated areas such as Central Park , the rivers , the Upper Bay , and the Jersey Meadows , which would be built-up areas elsewhere . In any case , the attacker can always step up the power of his weapon or utilize an additional bomb to cover the desired area . // By the most conservative estimates , a successful attack on the 50 most important urban centers listed by the Air Defense Command , containing 5o per cent of the U.S. population , would produce 15 to 20 million dead and 20 to 25 million injured . Such a casualty rate would produce almost insuperable medical problems . Under normal conditions , a hospital requires five persons to care for one patient . It has been estimated that at Nagasaki , under the most primitive medical conditions , each survivor required two persons to care for him . The whole surviving population of an affected area would therefore either be injured or engaged in caring for the injured . Even then , adequate medical assistance for the injured will be impossible , for most hospitals and most medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , suffer the same damage and casualties as the rest of the population . In the United States there are only moo thousand medical doctors or 16o thousand medically trained personnel , if one adds veterinarians and trained nurses ? a number which is barely sufficient even for peacetime conditions . Then , too , it will be impossible to stockpile blood plasma in the quantities which will be required for the casualties of a thermonuclear attack or to administer it could it be stockpiled . Since eight nurses working under favorable conditions can administer only to thousand blood transfusions a month , it is apparent that transfusions for casualties measured in the millions are out of the question . The medical situation is further complicated by the almost certain disappearance of hygienic conditions of life , leaving survivors of the attack open to a whole range of epidemic diseases caused by the destruction of water purification machinery , exhaustion of chlorine supplies , breakdowns of sanitary disposal systems , and petrification of normally refrigerated food . A thermonuclear attack on an urban center , it is clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II the effects of bombing were cumulative , whereas today one ro megaton weapon represents five times the explosive power of all the bombs dropped on Germany during four years of war and one hundred times // those dropped on Japan.4 In World War II , the popula tion could get used to the gradually increasing tempo of bombardment , while a thermonuclear weapon would pro-duce all the casualties at once . All the raids on Germany combined killed 330 thousand people . A single 10 megaton weapon exploded over any of the larger U.S. cities will kill several times that number . A World War II type of attack left no residual dangers except for land mines which could be identified fairly easily . An attack with modern weapons will contaminate the blast area with severe radi ation and thus add to the psychological burdens of the survivors . A disaster of such magnitude may prevent even trained persons from responding with efficiency and organization . Survivors of the raid on Nagasaki have reported the sense of shock which seized them after the attack . It was seven days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb represents the same order of increase in explosive power over the atomic bomb ex ploded at Nagasaki as the Nagasaki bomb did over the largest blockbuster of World War II , that is , a thousand-fold increase . Moreover , in World War II even the largest raid af fected only a limited area within a city ; it never paralyzed the entire urban area . The parts of the city which were not under attack could come to the assistance of the stricken area and thus mitigate the worst effects of a raid , often while it was still in progress . Even within the section under attack essential services such as hospitals could frequently be maintained . World War II , therefore , rep-resented the marginal case in which the highly elaborated // structure which is a city could still profit from its specialized functions . But confronted with a thermonuclear attack , the modern city may carry the seeds of its own destruction within itself . Specialization of urban functions presupposes a high order of managerial skill and the technical ability to utilize the interlocking components of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions of municipal government are located within the target area , it may be weeks before any coordinated activity is technically possible . In the meantime , the food and water supplies will have been contaminated with radioactive material and rescue operations will be hampered by the fact that the zones of heaviest damage are also most heavily radioactive . What happens to a society in such circumstances is almost unpredictable . The specialization of functions which in normal times serves as the condition of high productivity may create paralysis when the machinery for coordinated effort collapses . The elaboration of services may become a burden when the energy on which it depends is suddenly no longer available . A city without electricity , without water supply , without communications , is a contradiction in terms ? a concrete-and-steel jungle in which nature does not offer even the barest means of survival . A country as dependent as ours on the internal combustion engine can be paralyzed by the destruction of its oil refineries and distribution centers , most of which are located in or near big cities . Even our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catastrophe can not be measured only in the loss of material wealth . The psychological impact on the country of the sudden disappearance of even twenty-five population centers is incalculable . Since these centers contain most of the technically skilled and professional cadres ? the engineers , the doctors , the lawyers ? a society can lose most of its store of capital and accumulated skills in one blow . And the psychological impact of the loss will be compounded by the fact that the radiation which produces many of the casualties can not be seen or // felt while it is most pervasive and that the symptoms of radiation sickness may appear only after periods ranging from one to three weeks . A thermonuclear attack may thus become the symbol of the vanity of all human strivings . It may shake to the core the people 's confidence in the econ omy , the government and the national purpose . II Even if the national morale should withstand the disap pearance of its centers of control and the symbols of its power , it will be put to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on drawing support from the surrounding countryside , as the Federal Civil Defense Ad-ministration seems to assume . While the city is subjected to heat and blast , the surrounding countryside will be subjected to a collateral effect of thermonuclear weapons ? radioactive fall-out.5 When the first megaton hydrogen weapon was exploded over Eniwetok , the degree of fall-out had not been antici pated , although the phenomenon was well understood ! ' In retrospect , it appeared inevitable . In a sense this is the dilemma of the nuclear period : each technological break-through liberates forces which reach so far beyond all previous experience that most of the experts are at a loss to interpret the probable consequences . Indeed , the scale of experience on which their expertise is based often stands in the way of understanding the significance of new de velopments . The fall-out of thermonuclear weapons is caused by a combination of two processes : fission , which in lay terms represents the force liberated by the break-up of atoms , and fusion , which is the process of combining atoms . Most // of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by fission . Unlike the atoms of familiar substances , such as gold or oxygen , the atoms of radioactive substances disintegrate spontaneously , that is , they change their composition . In the process they emit high-energy rays capable of penetrating the human tissue and producing chemical , biological and genetic changes in the cells they traverse . Radioactivity is measured in half-lives : the amount of time it takes for a given quantity of radioactive material to decay to half its initial value . The longer the half-life , the more dangerous the radioactive substance from the point of view of fall-out . Were the thermonuclear weapon a " pure " hydrogen bomb , there would be little or no radioactivity , because the fusion of hydrogen atoms produces either stable substances or else radioactive particles of very short half-lives measured in seconds or minutes . But a thermonuclear device operates in three stages : fission , which is then used to produce fusion , which in turn is used to produce a much more powerful fission reaction . In colloquial terms , an atom bomb is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to trigger a superatom bomb reaction . Thus the radioactive material of a thermonuclear bomb stands in a direct relationship to its explosive power . The bomb exploded over Hiroshima , equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT , yielded about 2 pounds of radioactive material . A 10 megaton weapon will produce about i , 000 pounds of radioactive products , and a 20 megaton bomb , 2,000 pounds . Differences in explosive power account for different radiological effects . The fireball of a 20 kiloton weapon has a diameter of 1% miles . The fireball of a 10 megaton thermonuclear weapon has a diameter of 6 miles . Unless exploded at very high altitudes ( above 16 thousand feet ) , it will , therefore , come in contact with the ground below . As it does so , the blast of the explosion dislodges millions of tons of the surface . The rising fireball sucks up this debris and converts it into radioactive material which is then swept up into the stratosphere and deposited downwind . As a result , there takes place over a period of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elliptically shaped area . The nature and distribution of the fall-out depends on meteorological conditions and on the constitution of the surface above which the bomb ex plodes . The material will fall out according to the weight of the debris , the heavier materials falling out first , the lighter drifting farther downwind , the very light material remaining in the stratosphere for some time , thereby af fecting the background radiation of the universe . If the tar-get is a city where brick is a common building material , fall-out is aggravated because the silicon in the brick and the lime in the mortar will themselves become highly radioactive . The ellipse of the fall-out will vary with meteorological conditions . The United States test of March 1 , 1954 , dan gerously contaminated an area of 7,000 square miles ( or an area of the size of the state of New Jersey ) . ? Dr. Libby , a member of the Atomic Energy Commission , has described a possible contamination of loo thousand square miles ( or an area of the size of the states of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effect of fall-out is dependent on the amount of radiation to which an area is subjected . In general , the damage caused by radiation is twofold : direct damage leading to illness , death or reduced life expectancy , and genetic effects . The direct damage is caused generally by gamma rays which penetrate the skin and affect the mole cules of the cell structure . Alpha and beta rays cause bums and lesions ; they can not do internal damage unless they enter the system by means of contaminated food or water supplies.9 Because gamma rays damage the constituents of the blood , they will produce a greater susceptibility to in fection . There is strong evidence that radiation may induce // leukemia and cataracts months after exposure . The follow ing table gives some indication of the effects of exposure to radiation . The estimates are conservative and disregard genetic effects entirely . The measurements are in roentgen which is an arbitrary standard of measurement for radia tion . What then will be the likely exposure to fall-out ? Ex posure varies , of course , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the area covered by fall-out . On the basis of the figures given by Libby , the 7,000 square miles contaminated by the United States test of March 1 , 1954 , would have received an average exposure during the first twenty-four hours of 938 r's.10 This is twice the lethal dose and it will produce disability even at the outer edges of the ellipse . To be sure , after the first twenty-four hours radioactivity drops rapidly : it decreases roughly tenfold for every sevenfold increase in age . Thus at the end of a week the radioactivity assumed above would have dwindled to 93.8 r 's . This is still a dan gerous dosage , however , and exposure to it over any length of time would have serious consequences . Moreover , the // radioactivity is persistent : the residual dosage for the period from one week to one year would equal the dosage received during the first week , or about 1,500 r 's . The casualty rate will depend to a considerable extent on the awareness by the civilian population of the danger facing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if there are no preparations to deal with it , the casualty rate from fall-out will approach that produced by the heat and blast of the explosion . If precautionary measures are taken , the casualty rate will be reduced , but it will still remain substantial . Precautionary measures include shelter of any kind , particularly underground shelters with very small openings . Basements will reduce exposure and foxholes will be more effective still . As soon as radiation has dropped to a relatively safe level , say below ioo r 's , decontamination can be started by sweeping radioactive ash from rooftops and streets , flushing them with water or even raking the earth . If these decontamination measures are not taken , the area may be uninhabitable for several months or even years . The danger from fall-out has been treated rather cavalierly . During the Symington hearings General LeMay testified that a person covered by three feet of dirt would be relatively safe.11 But the question remains whether millions of inhabitants of a 7,000-square-mile area ( not to speak of a 100 thousand-square-mile area under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first forty-eight hours of intense radioactivity and apply all necessary precautions afterwards . And the problem will be even more complicated in case of a sustained attack , because the fall-out patterns of various explosions may overlap and the explosions may not occur simultaneously . Since the fall-out pattern is so dependent on meteorological conditions , its effects will be relatively unpredictable in any given attack . Thus fall-out will almost inevitably catch a substantial proportion of the population of the affected area above ground . Given the fact that communications will probably have been impaired by the 11 U.S. Senate , Study of Airpower , cited , p. 165. // explosion , concerted action will be extremely difficult . Indeed , even informing the population of radiation levels or organizing effective measures for the simplest public health function will not be an easy matter . Moreover , the fall-out will contaminate crops and water supply . And since animals will not take shelter , livestock will either be killed or contaminated by eating radioactive matter . Thus , even in the best circumstances , fall-out after an attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to produce about 30 per cent of the casualties caused by the explosion , or five to ten million dead and seven to fifteen million injured . More importantly , very few undamaged areas would remain to give assistance to the stricken parts of the country . Indeed , an enemy could plan to detonate his weapons so as to blanket the greatest possible area . Thus all energies of every affected area would have to be directed toward the sheer problem of survival , preventing epidemics , caring for the injured and avoiding so far as possible exposure to radiation . This will strain the recuperative powers of a country to the utmost . The cities will not be able to count on assistance from the surrounding countryside . Evacuation of cities , even when practicable , may not reduce casualties , for it may simply move the evacuees into a fall-out area . And the fall-out area would not be able to support a large influx of refugees in the face of the destruction of all food supplies . When the question of survival is posed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to the local level and directed to meeting immediate needs . More refinements could be added , but , at this level of catastrophe , even minimum estimates suffice to make the basic point that a society which suffers a disaster of this magnitude would of necessity have to undergo a fundamental transformation . Europe has never recovered either from the bloodletting or from the shock of World War I. For World War I did more than destroy an elite , it undermined faith in a way of life . On the battlefields of France disappeared the hopes of the Golden Age , of inevitable // progress , of triumphant reasonableness , that were as much cardinal principles of nineteenth-century Europe as they are of contemporary America . Since the shock of World War I , strong yet democratic government in Europe has been difficult , because confidence in the traditional leadership has been lacking and because the leaders had lost faith in their mission . The result , in many countries of Europe , was either dictatorship , which represents an abdication of responsibility by the people , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership . Analogous , though more abrupt , reactions can be expected in a society which has undergone a sustained thermonuclear attack . Any society operates through confidence in an orderly succession of events , either natural or social . A catastrophe is an interruption in what has come to be considered natural . The panic it often produces is the reflection of an inability to react to an unexpected situation and the attempt to flee as rapidly as possible into a familiar and , therefore , predictable environment . If a familiar environment remains , some confidence can be restored . Most natural catastrophes can be dealt with , because they affect only a very small geographic area or a very small proportion of the population . The remainder of the society can utilize its machinery of cooperative effort to come to the assistance of the stricken area . Indeed , such action tends to reinforce the cohesiveness of a society , because it becomes a symbol of its value and efficiency . The essence of the catastrophe produced by an all-out thermonuclear war , however , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escaping into familiar relationships . When all relationships , or even most relationships , have to be reconstituted , society as we know it today will have been fundamentally transformed . III In addition to its drastic impact on the social structure and the material well-being of the warring nations , an all-out war with modern weapons would produce genetic 8o NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOREIGN POLICY effects and consequences from long-term fall-out , which might affect all humanity.12 The same gamma rays which in larger doses produce radiation sickness are at all levels of exposure capable of producing genetic effects . Any radiation which reaches the reproductive organs will cause changes in the units gov erning heredity , the genes . A gene which becomes per manently altered is said to mutate . Changes in the genes of the reproductive cells , though usually causing no de tectable damage to the person concerned if the dosage is fairly low , may profoundly affect the following and subse quent generations . Geneticists believe that mutations which are large enough to be measured are generally harmful . In the ge netic sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more drastic ones . A serious dosage of radiation may produce sterility and thus work itself out in one generation . A less critical exposure may cause the off-spring to be obviously handicapped and not likely to re-produce ; it would , therefore , work itself out in two generations . Other dosages may produce handicaps which are transmitted for many generations and which be-come part of the biological inheritance of the race . Thus a mutation need not necessarily , or even usually , produce freaks . The most common mutations , in fact , are only slightly detrimental in any one generation . Of course , there are so-called spontaneous mutations which are not induced by radiation . Others are induced by the radiation which is part of the natural background of the universe , as , for example , by cosmic rays . These two causes , in fact , produce most of the mutations which supply the mechanism of evolution . But any additional radiation produces mutations in direct proportion to the exposure . And the genetic effect of radiation is thought by most geneticists to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirty years is genetically as significant as 30 is received at one time.13 According to the predominant view , there is no such thing as a genetically safe dose , although some dosages may not produce statistically noticeable short-term effects . Since half the United States children are born to parents below the age of thirty , the significant dos-age from the genetic point of view is the accumulated ex posure over a thirty-year period . At present the population of the United States is exposed to radiation from three sources : general background radiation from cosmic rays ? the thirty-year dosage averages about 4.3 roentgens ; x-rays and fluoroscopes ? the thirty-year dosage amounts to about 3 roentgens ; fall-out from weapons tests . The effects from fall-out , in turn , are of three types : ( I ) close-in fall-out occurring over an area of several thou-sand square miles where the radioactive material de scends within a period of ten to twenty hours ; ( 2 ) intermediate fall-out where radioactive material descends within several weeks after the explosion , usually by pro viding a nucleus for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed fall-out composed of material that remains in the air over a period of months or even years . The last category is composed of very tiny radioactive particles which are swept up into the stratosphere and dispersed by the pre vailing winds . They become , in effect , part of the back-ground radiation . If weapons tests were continued at the rate of the two most active years , 1953-55 , they would pro-duce an average thirty-year dose of about 0.2 roentgens in the Northern Hemisphere.14 While any increase in radia tion should be avoided , the indicated dosage from weapons tests is not of itself likely to produce statistically significant mutations . It would be different , however , with an all-out thermo82 NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOREIGN POLICY nuclear war . If even present weapons tests raise the back-ground radiation , it is clear that there must be a theoretical point at which thermonuclear war would pro-duce a level of background radiation which would have serious genetic effects even in the short term . Indeed it is theoretically possible , although less likely , so to contami nate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemisphere . The background radiation that is of immedi ate concern to geneticists is the " doubling dosage : " the radiation which would cause the present rate of genetic defects of about 2 per cent to be doubled . Of the loo mil-lion children which are expected to be born to the pres ently alive population of the United States , 4 million would then have inherited genetic defects , of which 200 thousand would appear in tangible form in the first gener ation . Geneticists have not agreed on the amount of radiation required to produce a doubling dosage , estimates varying from 5 is to 150 r 's . The report of the National Academy of Science placed the doubling dosage at between 3o-8o r 's over a thirty-year period . These levels of background radia tion can be produced by a relatively small number of high-yield weapons , as is shown by the following table : Thus 750 20 megaton bombs exploded in the Northern Hemisphere over a thirty-year period would in all likeliTHE // hood produce a doubling dosage . Even 250 such weapons ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the U.S.S.R. ? would increase the background radiation by 1 o r 's . This does not take into account the radiation produced either by close-in or intermediate fall-out . Most individuals in these two zones would suffer severe genetic damage in addition to other radiological injuries . In the 7,000 mile fall-out pattern from a 20 megaton weapon , described in the Atomic Energy Commission release of February 12 , 1955 , the accumulated average dosage at the end of one week would have been in excess of 1,500 r 's . With the best precautions , shelter program and decontamination , it is unlikely that the exposure can be reduced to much below 1 oo r 's . This would avoid the worst symptoms of radiation illness ; it would , however , almost certainly have very serious genetic effects . Even the loo thousand-square-mile fall-out pattern described by Libby would have an accumulated average dosage by the end of one week of close to 200 r 's . Since decontamination of so vast an area is next to impossible , it would be difficult even with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic consequences . Explosions of high-yield weapons produce another serious long-range peril : the fall-out of strontium-go . The danger from strontium is due to its extremely long halflife of nearly twenty years and the fact that it falls out over so wide an area that it may become a source of peril all over the Northern Hemisphere . Strontium-go is thought to produce bone cancer if absorbed in sufficient quantities ; at least it invariably does so in mice . Because it is concentrated in plants , its absorption by humans is almost unavoidable either directly or through the consumption of meat and other products , such as milk , from contaminated animals . Because of its extremely long half-life , the concentration of strontium-go tends to be cumulative . Thus the current concentration of strontium-go from weapons tests is on the average 1/ I o , 000 of what is generally considered a dangerous dose ; by 1970 the concentra84 NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOREIGN POLICY tion produced by these same tests will have risen to I/I , 000 of the danger dose.15 After 1970 the concentration will gradually decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out at the same scale as in the first years of their development . If even the relatively few test explosions could produce such a concentration of stron tium-9o , it is clear that an unrestricted thermonuclear war would probably lead to the decimation of the population of the Northern Hemisphere by strontium-go alone . Enough has been described to make clear that an all-out war with modern weapons will have consequences far transcending anything previously experienced . The blast and heat effects of thermonuclear and nuclear explosions can paralyze the intimate interrelationships of modern urban life . The immediate fall-out can reduce large areas to subsistence levels . The genetic effects and strontium-go could threaten the whole human race . In such a situation , it is futile to speak of " purely " mil itary considerations . From a purely military point of view , nothing is more efficient for cratering airfields , destroying port facilities or eliminating transportation centers than a megaton weapon . But the crucial prob lem of strategy is the relationship between power and the willingness to use it , between the physical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the consequences of a thermonuclear war , policy-makers will be reluctant to engage in a strategy , the penalty for which may well be social disintegration . The new technology thus increases our dangers at the precise moment when our commitments have never been greater . For the first time in our history we are vulnerable to a direct hostile attack . No remaining margin of indus trial and technological superiority can remove the con sciousness of our increasing vulnerability from the minds of policy-makers who have to make the decision of peace or war . But perhaps our dangers offer us at the same time a way out of our dilemmas . As long as the consequences of all-out thermonuclear war appear as stark to the other // side as to us , they may avert disaster , not through a reconciliation of interests but through mutual terror . Perhaps our identification of deterrence with retaliatory power , however faulty its historical analogies , provides the basis for achieving a durable peace , after all ? .4 ar I  --  *4 .

" iC'i4 l 7l n // OF ALL-OUT WAR OF COURSE , stalemates have occurred frequently in the history of warfare . Normally they have been brought about by the emergence of a balance between offense and defense on the battlefield . The distinguishing feature of the current use of the term is that it refers not to a balance on the battlefield , but to a calculus of risks . With each side possessing the capability of inflicting catastrophic blows on the other , war is said to be no longer a rational course of action . To be sure , even if a nuclear stalemate does exist , it would not make for stability in the present volatile state of technology , much less for a sense of harmony . The specter of a technological breakthrough by the other side would always loom large ; it would give an apocalyptic quality to all internal relations . It is important to be precise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal will depend on the correctness of our assessment of what the stalemate actually deters or does not deter , and of whether the kind of war to which the term stalemate can properly be applied exhausts the strategic options of either side . In one sense , nuclear stalemate can be taken to mean that victory in allout war has become meaningless . It is to the implications of nuclear technology for all-out war that we must now turn . The renunciation of total victory is repugnant to our military thought with its emphasis on breaking the enemy 's will to resist and its reliance on the decisive role of 86 // industrial potential . Because we have thought of war more in moral than in strategic terms , we have identified victory with the physical impotence of the enemy . But while it is true that a power can impose its will by depriving the opponent of the resources for continued resistance , such a course is very costly and not always necessary . The en emy 's decision whether to continue the struggle reflects not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of continued resistance and the objec tives in dispute . Military strength decides the physical contest , but political goals determine the price to be paid and the intensity of the struggle . Far from being the " normal " form of conflict , all-out war constitutes a special case . It comes about through the abdication of political leadership or when there exists so deep a schism between the contenders that the total de struction of the enemy appears as the only goal worth con-tending for . Thus war has been based on " purely " military considerations only during relatively brief periods : during the religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen turies , when a religious schism induced both sides to seek to destroy their opponent ; during the wars of the French Revolution , when an ideological schism caused the con-tenders to attempt to impose their notion of justice by force ; and during the cycle of wars beginning with World War I , which started with an abdication of political leader-ship and has since turned into a revolutionary struggle . In the intervals between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension of policy . Be tween the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the outbreak of World War I , wars were limited by the political objec tives of the opponents . ) Because they were fought for spe cific goals which did not threaten the survival of any of the powers , there existed a rough commensurability be tween the force employed and the transformation sought to be achieved . But , with the outbreak of World War I , war suddenly seemed to become an end in itself . After the first few months of the war , none of the protagonists would // have been able to name an objective other than the total defeat of the enemy , or at least they would have named objectives , such as the German demand for the annexation of Belgium , which amounted to unconditional surrender . This was all the more remarkable because none of the political leaders had prepared for anything but a war in the nineteenth-century style , with rapid movements and quick decisions , so that the stalemate of the first winter was due primarily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gap appeared between military and political planning , which has never been bridged . The military staffs had developed plans for total victory because in such plans no political limitations interfere with the full development of power and all factors are under the control of the military . But the political leadership proved incapable of giving these military objectives a political expression in terms of peace aims . It was forgotten that the rapid decisions of nineteenth-century warfare had been due , above all , to the willingness to acknowledge defeat . And defeat was acknowledged with relative ease because its consequences did not threaten the national survival . When the purpose of war became total victory , however , the result was a conflict of ever increasing violence which petrified its hatreds in a peace treaty which considered more the redressing of sacrifices than the stability of the international order . It was overlooked , moreover , that total victory was made possible in both wars only through a fortuitous combination of circumstances . The strategy of both world wars rested on two related factors : national economies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relatively small destructiveness so that any increase in the strength of one side could prove strategically significant . Until the industrial revolution , total war in the modern sense of fully mobilizing all national resources had been impossible . A subsistence economy simply could not spare the manpower or the resources for such largescale operations . Armies were , therefore , largely composed of mercenaries , and they were small because the economy could not support a substantial standing force . A merESOTERIC // cenary army did not possess the morale of modern citizen armies ; the soldiers were not personally concerned with the fate of the country for which they fought and , in the crudest sense , their ability to carry on their profession depended on their survival . Typical battles of the eighteenth century involved complicated maneuvers , which determined the relative position of the two sides , but which caused relatively few casualties because both commanders were eager to conserve their resources and could not rely on the staying power of their troops . Citizen armies , on the other hand , which appeared during revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations ; in the absence of a surplus of manpower , they frequently had to disband during the harvest season . This does not mean that wars fought by countries with subsistence economies did not produce great suffering . The very narrow margin of survival ensured that any disturbance of the economic balance was likely to produce cataclysmic effects on society . As a result , until the industrial revolution the collateral effects of war , the casualties caused by starvation or pestilence , were usually more severe than those of the battlefield . It was the industrial revolution and the specialization of functions it brought about which made possible the total mobilization of modern war . Even then the quest for total victory would have been self-defeating but for the relatively small destructiveness of what is now called conventional technology . For total victory is meaningful only if at the end of the war the victor retains sufficient physical resources to impose his will . And the margin has to be great in proportion as the victory sought is total . The objective of nineteenth-century warfare was to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more costly than the peace terms sought to be imposed . The more moderate the peace terms , the smaller the required margin of superiority . The war ended when a sovereign government agreed to the victor 's terms and thereby assumed responsibility for their execution . The victor 's task in these circumstances was to supervise the // fulfillment of his conditions by a government which in turn retained control over its own population . With the coming of total war , war has ceased to be an effort to determine the actions of a government ; its goal has become , almost invariably , to overthrow the enemy Ieadership . This has not only transformed every war into a variety of civil war , it has also increased the margin of superiority required to impose the victor 's will . Success in overthrowing the enemy government in effect forces the victor to assume responsibility for the civil administration of the defeated . We could afford to do so at the end of World War II , because neither our social nor our material structure had been seriously impaired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the scale of catastrophe produced by an all-out thermonuclear war , however , it is doubtful whether any society will retain either the physical or psychological resources to undertake the administration and rehabilitation of foreign countries . When energies are absorbed in an effort to assure bare survival , it is difficult to imagine a sustained effort to assume responsibility for governing the people of the recent enemy , whose social disintegration and physical destruction is likely far to exceed those of Germany and Japan after World War II . And , in the absence of physical occupation , victory may prove illusory . It may create a vacuum which can be exploited by powers whose position relative to the contenders has been improved by the devastation of all-out war . The decline of Europe started with the exhaustion produced by the first World War , for in it even the victors were weakened in relation to the non-European powers . The destructiveness of modern weapons deprives victory in an all-out war of its historical meaning . Even the side which inflicts a greater devastation than its opponent may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same exorbitant destructiveness has altered the significance of the industrial potential on which we have traditionally relied for victory . Since World War I our strategic doctrine has always been built around the proposition that our forces-in-being at the beginning of a war // need only be large enough to avoid disaster and that we could then crush the enemy by mobilizing our industrial potential after the outbreak of hostilities . The strategic significance of our industrial potential has presupposed a fortuitous combination of circumstances , however : our invulnerability to direct attack , the existence of allies to hold a line while we were mobilizing , and , above all , a certain stage of industrial and technological development . Our industrial potential would have been unavailing if it could have been destroyed at the outset of a war . Our geographic remoteness would have become a liability if we had not had allies to hold a line while we mobilized . The same factors which made it difficult for an enemy to attack us would have militated against an attempt on our part to restore the situation if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , even at the stage of conventional technology , the emergence of the U.S.S.R. as the dominant power in Eurasia and the decline in strength of our traditional allies would have altered the significance of our forces-in-being and the relative importance of our industrial potential . Because resistance in major areas of the globe is now impossible unless the United States lends its support at the very outset or pledges it in advance , we require forces-in-being to carry out a large part of the task which has heretofore been performed by our allies : to hold a line while we bring our power to bear . And the importance of forces-in-being becomes all the greater because we are now subject to a devastating attack at the beginning of any war and because the increased power of modern weapons has demonstrated that the significance of industrial potential depends on a certain balance between the complexity of weapons and their destructiveness . Until the middle of the nineteenth century , weapons were simple and easy to manufacture and their destructive power was very low . As a result , trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on human rather than on material resources . Even a backward nation could achieve eminence , provided it had sufficient human material , because simple weapons systems did not require an elaborate industrial plant . // Thus Russia became a major power despite an almost complete lack of industry . Until the middle of the nine-teenth century , the limiting condition to the conduct of war was rarely the lack of equipment . Time and again powers rose from complete defeat by replenishing their military arsenals , often in a matter of a few months . Vic-tory , almost invariably , was due to greater reserves of man-power or to a superior strategy , rarely to a superior industrial capacity . In order to put a premium on industrial potential , weapons must be sufficiently complex to require a sub-stantial production effort , but not so destructive as to drain the national substance before industrial mobiliza-tion can make itself felt . If the stockpiles of weapons avail-able at the beginning of a war suffice to destroy the opponent 's industrial potential , it is clear that industrial potential has lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces-in-being are superior , whatever its industrial base , will gain a decisive advantage . As a result ? our industrial potential proved strategically most signifi-cant when there existed a balance between the destructive-ness of weapons and the complexity of the means of their delivery . Any increase either in the power of weapons or in their number could then be translated into a strategic advantage . But when weapons have become extremely powerful , there is an upper limit beyond which increased destructiveness pays diminishing returns . When both sides are capable of inflicting catastrophic losses on each other with their forces-in-being , an increment of destructive power may be strategically insignificant . The greater the power of individual weapons , the less the importance of numbers or even of quality ? the twin expressions of a superior industrial capacity . When one plane can carry a weapon capable of destroying a city , the side with the larger number of planes will derive little advantage from them if its opponent possesses a sufficient quantity to inflict a devasting counterblow . Even su-perior quality may be overcome to some extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery system will be meaningless as long as both sides can reach // their targets . Thus an all-out war fought with modern weapons will be decided by the forces-in-being . We can no longer afford to count on a more or less prolonged period of mobilization . The only way we can derive an advantage from our industrial capacity is by utilizing it before the outbreak of a war . The importance of forces-in-being , coupled with the de structiveness of modern weapons , means that Douhet 's classic description of air strategy , which has determined to a considerable extent our thinking about all-out war , is now obsolete : " . . . aerial warfare admits of no defense , only offense . We must therefore resign ourselves to the offensives the enemy inflicts upon us , while striving to put all our resources to work to inflict even heavier ones upon him . " 2 The identification of victory with a superior of fensive effort ? in effect , the air strategy of World War II ? made sense so long as a superior load of explosives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be decisive to the degree that attrition of industrial potential was significant . In a war fought with modern weapons , however , the significant attrition is that which reduces not the industrial potential , but the forces-in-being . The industrial potential can be wiped out in the later stages of a war , almost at will , but if the enemy 's forces-in-being are not destroyed at the very beginning , they will inflict a series of blows which may cause the social fabric to break down long before the enemy 's stockpile of weapons is ex hausted . The importance of forces-in-being compared to indus trial potential has a paradoxical consequence : that a war can continue long after victory has become mean ingless . For example , it is possible for a surprise attack to destroy the fifty most important metropolitan centers in the United States , with the consequences described in the previous chapter . While this could produce social disinte gration , it would probably not affect the ability of our // Strategic Air Command to retaliate . The result of such an exchange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that an all-out strategy can be implemented after the social basis for it has disappeared lends an esoteric quality to the strategy of all-out war . It has been compared to a situation where two hostile tribes armed with poison darts face each other across a canyon . The poison takes several hours to be effective , but is fatal afterwards . In these circumstances , landing the first blow will not be decisive . It will ruin the " economy , " but the weapons are still useful and they can deliver an equally lethal counterblow.3 Thus victory can be achieved only if one side succeeds in destroying the other 's poison darts ? its forces-in-being ? before they can be launched . In assessing the strategy appropriate for all-out war , it is important to distinguish two sets of circumstances : the strategy appropriate for the offensive and that for resisting attack . In the past , the strategy for avoiding defeat was roughly identical with that which aimed for victory . In an all-out thermonuclear war , on the other hand , the two strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power 's will , can be achieved only by eliminating the op ponent 's retaliatory force while retaining sufficient striking power to exact acquiescence through the threat of thermo nuclear devastation . The fact that victory in all-out war presupposes the destruction of the opponent 's forces-in-being has given rise to the argument that such a war could be confined to de stroying the installations of the opposing strategic striking forces . Because the outcome of the war depends on the is-sue of the air battle , it is argued , the bombing of cities would be unwise in the early stages of a war and unneces sary after air superiority has been achieved.4 This argument assumes that victory is the only rational objective in an all-out war and that both sides can aim for victory simultaneously . But the nature of modern // war works counter to such assumptions . Victory , the destruction of the opponent 's forces-in-being or the reduction of it to levels which can be contained by the defense system , is in practice unattainable except by surprise attack . For , with adequate warning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alert his defenses . Once a surprise attack has been carried out , however , the strategic problem for the victim is transformed . Instead of aiming to wipe out the enemy 's retaliatory force which , with the advantage of initiative is probably airborne , he must now strive to deprive the opponent of the fruits of his assault . The strategy for avoiding defeat would not seek to keep damage to a minimum , which is the reason for limiting a war initially to the destruction of air installations . On the contrary , the most effective reaction to surprise attack may well be to inflict maximum devastation on the opponent 's society . An air battle would be the most rational strategy for the side which has the advantage of surprise , because it would place the enemy at its mercy at minimum cost . But for the side which stands to lose the air battle , the most rational strategy may well be to exact the highest price by inflicting the greatest possible devastation . Thus , there exists no " cheap " way for fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its initial strategy , may resort to the kind of bombing which will maximize the damage inflicted on its opponent . It must not be forgotten that fifty 10-megaton weapons , properly placed , could kill or injure at least 30 per cent of the population of the United States and approximately the same proportion in the Soviet Union . It is against this background that the strategic problem of all-out thermonuclear war must be considered . An allout war will be primarily an air war , or at least a war of strategic striking forces , and it will be decided by the forces-in-being . As for the United States , our strategic problem is complicated by the fact that we have explicitly rejected surprise attack as an instrument of our policy . This is demonstrated not only by repeated statements of policy , but above all by our entire past behavior . If we re96 NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOREIGN POLICY frained from utilizing our atomic monopoly at a time when the Soviet capability to retaliate was almost nonex istent , it is against all probability that we would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow in all likeli hood also concedes the margin required to impose its will . As a result , unless our air defense is capable of reducing the enemy blow below the level of catastrophe ? an un likely situation ? the strategic problem of all-out war must be stated for us not in terms of a strategy to achieve victory , but of a strategy to avoid defeat . The purpose of our capability for all-out war will be to deter Soviet aggression against us by developing a retaliatory force of a size which can inflict an unacceptable amount of damage on the enemy , no matter what level of " destruction he may accomplish by a surprise attack . " A deterrent force , " General LeMay has said , " is one that is large enough and efficient enough that no matter what the enemy force does , either offensively or defensively , he still will receive a quantity of bombs or explosive force that is more than he is willing to accept . Therefore , he never starts a war . " 6 II Deterrence is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action by posing risks which will seem to him out of proportion to any gains to be achieved . The higher the stakes , the more absolute must be the threat of destruction which faces him . But the re-verse is also true : the smaller the objective , the less should be the sanction . For the power of modern weapons deters not only aggression , but also resistance to it . An all-out strategy may , therefore , be highly effective in deterring all-out war . If it is the sole counter to enemy aggression , it may at the same time invite limited aggressions which by themselves do not seem " worth " a final showdown . // The crucial problem for a strategy which seeks to deter all-out war is to prevent a situation from arising in which the U.S.S.R. can calculate that it possesses a sufficient margin of certainty to make a surprise attack on the United States seem a worthwhile risk . To be sure , such a strategy presupposes a certain amount of rationality in an enemy . But strategy can only count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent bent on self-destruction . What is a sufficient degree of certainty , and how can it be achieved ? Obviously , the mere ability to inflict a greater amount of damage than the enemy will be meaningless if at the end of the war the victor does not retain sufficient resources to impose his will . An aggressor , in trying to decide whether to launch an all-out war , must therefore be able to count on a combination of the following factors : he must be certain that his surprise attack will reduce our forces-in-being to a level at which his defense can contain them , or at least at which they are no longer able to inflict unacceptable damage ; he must be confident that our air defense will not reduce his attacking force to a level at which it will no longer be able to inflict the amount of damage he calculates as necessary to impose his will . The degree of certainty , moreover , must be almost foolproof : a slight probability will not be sufficient , for the attacker is staking not his chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack by the U.S.S.R. could , therefore , be impelled only by a consciousness of overwhelming power , of great United States vulnerability , or the fear of an imminent United States attack . The last contingency is a special case and will be discussed separately . Can the U.S.S.R. then calculate with the possession of an overwhelming superiority ? Many witnesses before the Symington Committee argued as if military superiority depended almost entirely on numbers of airplanes , particularly of long-range bombers . " . . . the only thing I can say , " testified General LeMay , " is that from 1958 on , he the U.S.S.R. is stronger in long-range air power than we are , // and it naturally follows that if he is stronger , he may feel that he should attack . " 6 But this does not follow naturally at all . Superiority can not be measured in numbers of offensive planes alone ; it depends also on the capability for defense . A country which staked everything on its offensive air power would be simplifying the strategic problem of its opponent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cisely the number of planes required for maximum de structiveness . They could operate at optimum levels of performance and use the most efficient tactics . Except for mechanical failures , they would suffer no losses and their bombing accuracy would be high . Nor would the country which placed all its bets on its offensive air power gain a significant advantage by utilizing for its strategic strik ing force the resources which might otherwise have gone into air defense . With modern weapons , the point of diminishing returns in increased offensive power is reached fairly quickly . The best strategic posture for an all-out war de pends on the proper " mix " of offensive and defen sive capabilities . If so many resources are devoted to defense that the offensive striking force can no longer inflict an unacceptable degree of damage on the aggressor , the enemy may be tempted to attack . Once freed of the danger of retaliation , the worst that could happen to him would be his inability to reach the target . If the defense is slighted , too great a demand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal offense-defense relation-ship is one in which the defense can reduce the enemy attack to acceptable levels while the offense can not be so contained by the enemy 's defense . Such a relationship is unattainable in practice , but the adequacy of the posture for all-out war depends on the degree to which it can be approximated . Since the ulti mate outcome of an all-out war depends so importantly on the ability of the strategic striking forces to reach their // targets , any discussion of the strategy for all-out war must start with the problems of the offensive . The Soviet Long-Range Air Force is a comparatively recent development , dating in effect from 1954 . To be sure , ever since 1948 the U.S.S.R. has possessed a moderate number of TU-4 's ( for which the NATO code name is " Bull " ) . This was a copy of our B-2g , one of which had fallen into Soviet hands during the war after making an emergency landing in Siberia . Since the range of the TU-4 's was only 2,200 miles , they could reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then only on one-way missions . The development by the U.S.S.R. of long-range planes capable of undertaking two-way missions , when coupled with the growth of the Soviet nuclear stockpile , therefore , represented a basic trans-formation in the postwar strategic balance . Henceforth , in every decision of peace or war we would have to weigh our risks in terms of the prospective destruction of our major cities . The present Soviet Long-Range Air Force is composed of two basic types of planes : a turbo-propeller-driven plane of very long range , for which the NATO code name is " Bear , " and a heavy jet bomber , for which the NATO code name is " Bison . " The United States Air Force has no equivalent for the " Bear , " whose major asset is its long radius of about 4,000 miles . Because of its relatively slow speed ( 450 miles per hour ) compared to that of modern jet planes , its losses against high-performance fighters and missiles would be considerable . The " Bison " was first seen in some quantity during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew over Moscow . The " Bi son " is estimated to have a radius of around 3,000 miles and a top speed of 610 miles per hour. ? Thus the " Bison " is able to reach only a third of the United States without aerial refueling , even from Soviet advanced bases on the Kola and Chukchi peninsulas . The " Bear " can cover from // one-third to one-half of United States territory from advanced Soviet bases without aerial refueling . From the Chukchi peninsula the " Bison " can cover seven-eighths of the United States with one aerial refueling and all of the United States with two refuelings . From the Kola peninsula the " Bison " can cover one-fourth of the United States with one refueling and all except the southern tip of Texas on a twice-refueled mission . The " Bear , " of course , will be able to cover all of the United States from Soviet advanced bases with one aerial refueling.8 ( See map , p. loo . ) The United States Strategic Air Force possesses three basic types of bombers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of 600 miles per hour and a range in excess of 3,000 miles ; the obsolescent B-36 , which has a top speed of 435 miles per hour and a range of 1o,000 miles ; and the new heavy bomber , the B-52 , which has a range in excess of 6,000 miles and a top speed in excess of 65o miles per hour . The B-47 , of course , is not an intercontinental bomber . It requires aerial refueling to reach Soviet targets from United States territory , although it can cover most of Soviet territory from overseas bases . The B-52 is an intercontinental bomber which can attack metropolitan Russia from the United States , but whose effectiveness will be increased by our overseas base structure . We now possess 33 wings of B-47 's with 45 planes in a wing ; 5 of these are reconnaissance wings with 30 planes in a wing , so that the effective force of B-47 's is 1,410 planes.9 Our B-36 's are organized in 11 wings of 30 planes . As they are replaced by B-52 's , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1959 , when our heavy bomber wings will be all jet , we will have about 500 B-52's.10 The consensus of Air Force testimony at the Symington hearings was that by 1959 the Soviet Long-Range Air Force t02 NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOREIGN POLICY would outnumber ours and that for this reason we would be in dire peril.1 ' Strategic superiority can not be measured numerically , however , for it depends also on such factors as the quality and range of planes and the location of air bases . The prospective numerical superiority of the U.S.S.R. is confined , to begin with , to the category of heavy bombers . The B-52 's will be fewer than the combined numbers of " Bisons " and " Bears . " To be sure , the Soviet Air Force also has a substantial number of medium-range jet bombers , code-named " Badger , " with a range of about 3,000 miles . They are unable , however , to reach the United States from present Soviet bases , except on one-way missions . Their role in an all-out war would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombers , on the other hand , are capable of attacking Soviet targets either from our overseas bases or from the United States by using aerial refueling techniques which have become standard practice in our Strategic Air Command . As a result , even quantitatively the strategic equation is not as foreboding as a comparison of heavy bomber forces would make it appear . Moreover , a Soviet attack on the United States is a technically more complex undertaking than performance figures of planes would indicate . In order to achieve maximum surprise and cut warning time to a minimum , an allout attack should be launched from the airfields where planes are based for training . But neither the " Bison " nor the " Bear " can reach any part of the United States , except the tip of Maine , from the interior of the U.S.S.R. , without aerial refueling.12 To launch a massive blow they would have to be staged to advanced bases in Russia 's Arctic regions . This in turn would give us some additional strategic warning . At the very least , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the alert , thus reducing the possibility or the degree of surprise . Under certain conditions it might induce us to launch a preventive attack . // Even from advanced bases the Soviet heavy bombers can not reach major United States targets and return without at least one aerial refueling . There is little evidence , however , that the Soviet Air Force has mastered the intricate technique of aerial refueling ; it is not even certain that the Soviet Union possesses any substantial number of tankers . Even after the Soviet Air Force has developed aerial refueling , it may be prevented by geography from deriving full benefit from it . A plane which is refueling in the air is extremely vulnerable ; it should therefore do so in an area relatively immune from hostile interference . This is all the more important because the meeting between tanker and bomber must be precisely calculated , so as to take place on schedule . Diversionary tactics forced on either plane can wreak havoc with refueling plans . A look at the map ( p. ioo ) demonstrates that in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force would possess no safe areas for refueling once it leaves its advanced bases . It would have to refuel over hostile territory exposed to constant attack . This would tend to increase the rate of attrition and minimize the possibility of surprise . Aerial refueling , in short , is not an efficient Soviet tactic , and one-way missions are uneconomical , given the cost and complexity of present planes and the difficulty of replacing them . Unless the U.S.S.R. possessed a really staggering number of planes and unless its initial attack completely eliminated our retaliatory force , the reliance on one-way missions would shift the balance against the Soviet LongRange Air Force with every raid . A strategy based on oneway missions would eliminate the aggressor 's forces-inbeing and thereby the instrument to impose his will . A country which has suffered a surprise attack by one-way missions would already have experienced the worst its opponent is capable of inflicting . Surrender is induced , however , not only as a reaction to past punishment but by the prospect of future danger . Even the maximum damage accomplished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will unless he retains resources to // inflict additional devastation as the penalty for not complying with his wishes . An aggressor who used up all or most of his delivery vehicles in a surprise attack would become totally vulnerable to retaliation if his opponent had any remaining offensive strength . One-way missions with present complicated planes are more suitable for a strategy of desperation than for a surprise attack . Thus a comparison of relative offensive capabilities does not indicate a sufficient Soviet margin to make it seem probable that the Kremlin will deliberately unleash all-out war , at least until its strategic striking forces become much larger and its planes develop longer range . III New Soviet planes with longer range may , of course , overcome the refueling problem and enable the Soviets to launch an attack from the interior of metropolitan Russia . Even then complete surprise will be difficult to achieve . The directions from which a Soviet attack by airplanes on the United States can take place are limited . Equivalent resources put into air defense by the United States and the Soviet Union will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches to guard than for the Soviet Union with a long periphery to defend . To be sure , an effective air defense is complicated by the power and range of modern weapons . In World War II , a rate of losses of Io per cent was considered unacceptable . With conventional weapons the cost of producing the plane and of training the crew was so high in relation to the damage which could be inflicted in a single raid that , unless a plane could perform several missions on a statistical average before being shot down , strategic bombing became a wasteful operation . But when one plane can carry a weapon capable of destroying a city , much heavier demands are placed on the air-defense system . To produce significant attrition , it must be able to hold the enemy offensive to a level which preserves the social fabric from destruction . Against a strategic air force // armed with thermonuclear weapons , losses of as high as go per cent inflicted upon the attacking force may not pre vent catastrophic devastation . Although no air-defense system now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence imposes an additional strain on the enemy . It forces him to devote more resources to his offensive striking force without adding to its strategic impact . The very existence of an air defense throws off an attacker 's calculations . He can not be certain about the effectiveness of the defense until he has tested it , and he must , therefore , allow a wider margin for error than in the case of an unopposed attack . In order to overcome a determined defense , it is necessary to increase the attacking force considerably . But the larger the striking force , the more obvious the preparations which have to be made before launching a blow and the greater will be the chances of obtaining warning . As the defense gains in effectiveness , the attacker must also divert resources to combat it directly , further decreasing his strategic effectiveness . To be sure , as Paul Nitze has shown in a brilliant paper , the attrition rate of defense will not remain fixed at the same percentage , regardless of the nature of the attack.13 By exceeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelm the opposing defense . A defense system may exact 8o per cent attrition of the first 2,000 planes , but only 20 per cent of the next I , 000 . But the basic function of defense still holds : at best , to reduce the enemy attack to acceptable levels ; at worst , to force the enemy to devote the greatest possible amount of resources to his offensive mission without improving its probable effectiveness . Work on the United States air-defense system did not start seriously until 1952 , when we first became concerned about the Soviet Long-Range Air Force . Its primary functions are detection , identification , interception and destruction of hostile aircraft . The magnitude of the problem is shown by the fact that on an average day there are // 30 thousand domestic and 600 foreign flights which have to be monitored , at least as they approach sensitive areas.14 Detection is crucial . Not only must it provide time for effective interception , but it must also give sufficient warning to prevent our retaliatory force from being caught on the ground . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against which surprise attack by manned bombers will be very difficult , and it will be supported by a defensive force that should impose a substantial rate of attrition on the attackers . The United States air-defense system is based on four lines : two primarily for detection and two others for interception as well . The first detection apparatus is at the Distant Early Warning Line ( DEW Line ) which extends across the Arctic circle . This is a network of heavy radar stations supported by an elaborate communications system . When fully developed , it should be able to detect a Soviet attack soon after it leaves Soviet advanced bases on the Kola and Chukchi peninsulas . The DEW Line is backed up by another series of detection stations from the base of Hudson Bay across Canada . The mid-Canada Line , like the DEW Line , is designed for detection only , although , given the power of modern weapons and the effects of fall-out , it would be desirable to destroy hostile planes as far away from their targets as possible and over relatively uninhabited regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first fighting line into Canada , and this may be the case by 1961 when the detection system has been fully developed . At present , the first sustained interception ? except for Canadian efforts ? will occur at a line along the United States-Canadian border . From their first contact with this line , enemy planes will be exposed to heavy interceptor attacks . As they approach sensitive areas , they will be subject to antiaircraft fire , which by 1959 will be almost entirely composed of guided missiles : either the Army Nike or the Air Force Talos and other missiles still under development . With a range of 6o-loo miles , soon to be 14 For a very good description of our air-defense system , see U.S. Senate , Study of Airpower , cited p. 303 ff . ( Testimony of General Partridge. ) // extended , and with atomic warheads which can destroy anything within a cubic mile of air , the missile defenses are becoming increasingly formidable . Many experts estimate that they will be able to inflict losses of up to 8o per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots in the first wave of attack , especially if they were unacquainted with the risks confronting them , but there is at least some doubt about their morale once the rate of attrition became known . Conceivably pilot morale may become the limiting condition of strategic air war conducted by manned bombers . There exists , moreover , another factor which makes it difficult for the U.S.S.R. to achieve surprise or wipe out our forces-in-being ? our system of overseas air bases . ( See map , p . Io8 . ) Since the aggressor can not know the precise pattern of dispersal of our retaliatory force , he must , in order to have a calculable margin of success , seek to hit all the bases of our Strategic Air Command , preferably simultaneously . But their geographic location makes a simultaneous attack on all United States bases almost impossible . Since the SAC bases in the continental United States are located at a much greater distance in flying time from Soviet territory than our overseas bases , the Soviet Long-Range Air Force would have two options . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States and overseas , with the result that Soviet planes would be detected overseas before the planes destined to attack our domestic bases had reached the DEW Line , thus adding to the alert time available to SAC in the United States . Or the Soviet Air Force could arrange its flight plans so that planes would reach the two sets of targets simultaneously . In this case , our overseas bases would have the same warning time as those bases located within the territorial United States ? the time it takes a jet bomber to cover the distance between our DEW Line and the target . The first of these two contingencies ? an attempt so to arrange flight plans that our overseas bases will be attacked about the time that the first Soviet long-range planes reach the DEW Line ? is the more rational course // of action . An effort to attack both sets of targets simultaneously would expose the Soviet Union to a counterblow launched from our overseas bases while Soviet planes were still crossing Canada . But surprise even against our overseas air bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located along the periphery of Eurasia , any attack against them must cross intervening friendly territory , and this in turn should give them between one to two hours of warning time . And even a successful attack against our overseas bases would still leave the retaliatory force in the United States to be reckoned with , and it would be all the more formidable because of the additional warning time thus made available to it . Our overseas air bases therefore increase not only our offensive but also our defensive strength . They force the Soviet Air Force either to add to our warning time or to absorb a heavier United States offensive effort ; they function either as a form of early warning or as an addition to our retaliatory power . By contrast , the Soviet defensive problem is much more complicated than ours . While we have to defend a limited number of approaches , the Soviet Union must be prepared to repel raids from many directions , because our overseas bases ring the Soviet periphery . The existence of our carrier task forces , soon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of 1,500 miles , further adds to the Soviet problem . And our advantages in geographic position make aerial refueling a much more useful tactic for us than for the U.S.S.R. Even should a Soviet surprise blow against our overseas bases force us to launch our retaliatory attack from the United States , our planes could refuel over friendly areas and out of range of Soviet detection . Finally , while the Soviet Air Force can reach its targets in the United States only across some 1,500 miles of hostile Canadian territory , many of the presumed targets of our Strategic Air Force in the U.S.S.R. lie much closer to the Soviet early warning line . While we can expect a warning time of about two hours , the minimum considered necessary for effective defense measures , the Soviet no NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOREIGN POLICY will have no such assurance . To be sure , if the Soviet Air Force launches a surprise attack , their defensive system will be previously alerted against our counterblow . Nevertheless , the need to disperse their defenses , due to our superior base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to reduce our retaliatory blow to acceptable levels . Two conclusions emerge from this brief sketch of the United States air defenses. ( 1 ) The strategic significance of the Soviet Long-Range Air Force resides not in its total numbers but in that part of it which can escape attrition . Estimates of the attrition rate run as high as 8o per cent by 1959 , when the Soviet heavy bomber fleet is expected by some to exceed ours in numbers . ( 2 ) Whatever the attrition rate , the U.S.S.R. will find it almost impossible to achieve complete surprise . Against the present family of Soviet bombers , targets in the northern part of the United States should have at least two hours of warning , and targets in the southern part , where most of our SAC bases are located , would have three hours ' warning . If we are reasonably effective , such a warning time should in turn enable us to launch a substantial proportion of our retaliatory force , and this , together with the portion of SAC which is constantly airborne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inflict a devastating counterblow . In fact , in assessing the relative capabilities of both sides for winning an all-out war , it seems that for a limited period of time , until the Soviet Long-Range Air Force grows substantially stronger than it now is , we could probably impose our will on the U.S.S.R. through a surprise attack . A surprise attack launched simultaneously from our overseas bases and the continental United States might overwhelm the Soviet air defense and seriously cripple the Soviet Long-Range Air Force . Even then the U.S.S.R. could probably inflict serious losses on us . This is not an argument for preventive war . It is simply an attempt to analyze the real nature of strategic relationships . In the face of our strategic superiority , there is no need to be panicked by Soviet atomic blackmail . The SoESOTERIC // viet leadership , as will be seen below , has skillfully fos tered the illusion that it is willing to run all risks and that resistance to its pressures or any attempts to exploit its embarrassments may unleash a cataclysm.15 However useful this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chological warfare , it is belied by the strategic facts . The notion of nuclear stalemate under present conditions is more a testimony to the fears and conscience of the non-Soviet world than to actual Soviet power . In the short term the stalemate , if it exists , will be a balance between our unwillingness to use all-out war to achieve our goals and the Soviet inability to do so . With the growth of the Soviet Long-Range Air Force and thermonuclear stock-pile , the stalemate in all-out war will be between the abil ity of each side to inflict catastrophic blows on the other but to do so only at the risk of national catastrophe . Iv There is no reason for complacency , however . Even to-day there exist vulnerabilities which in time may cause serious changes in the strategic equation and expose us to unnecessary peril . Unless we reverse present attitudes , these vulnerabilities can be expected to increase . They are the dispersal of our Strategic Air Force , the neglect of civil defense , and the lag in antisubmarine warfare . All three vulnerabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for active to passive measures , a predilection for of fense over defense . Few concepts have been more difficult for us to accept than that the outcome of an all-out war may be determined not only by offensive power , but by the relative vulnerability of the contenders . Since our strategic doctrine concedes the first blow to the other side , dispersal of the Strategic Air Force becomes of cardinal importance . Dispersal is a form of defense , be- , cause it makes it more difficult to destroy our striking ' forces and their installations on the ground . Today our Strategic Air Force of some 2,000 planes is concentrated // on about 30 bases . The danger of inadequate dispersal was demonstrated in 1952 when a tornado damaged 8o per cent of our strategic striking force then located on some 18 bases . Today equipment worth $300 million is frequently located on bases costing $40 million . This degree of concentration not only improves the economics of a Soviet attack ; it is also a wasteful investment of our offensive resources . To be sure , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by mere numbers of installations . Nevertheless a moderate additional investment in base construction could halve our vulnerability . Then , too , much of our present air-defense system was designed for use against subsonic planes . Increased speed and altitude , even of manned Soviet bombers , will greatly reduce its effectiveness . It is vulnerable , moreover , to electronic countermeasures , at which the Soviet Air Force is becoming increasingly adept , and to low-level attacks . Finally , the present concept of beginning interception close to the United States-Canadian border is no longer adequate to the power of the new weapons . If the attacking planes are equipped with " dead-man fuses " which detonate the bomb in case the plane is destroyed , fall-out casualties would approach catastrophic proportions , even if the target itself escaped the effects of heat and blast . As the increasing power and speed of delivery vehicles multiply the difficulties of active defense , ever greater importance should be attached to civil defense . While active defense seeks to destroy the largest possible proportion of the enemy attacking force before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy offensive by reducing as much as possible the damage which it can inflict . A dispersion of targets will reduce the value of enemy hits . Locating essential resources in deep shelters will deprive a successful attack of a great deal of its effectiveness . A country whose steel industry can be wiped out by one weapon is more vulnerable than an opponent whose steel industry is dispersed over 30 different locations . A power whose population is protected to some degree by a deep shelter program can run greater risks than an enemy whose people are totally exposed to attack . // Civil defense has the advantage , moreover , that it is relatively immune to advances on the part of the offensive . Any improvement in the speed or range of delivery vehicles alters their relationship to the active defense . It improves their chances of survival , but it does not affect their ability to destroy the target if they can reach it . Dispersal would be a form of insurance after the present air-defense system has become obsolescent . Deep shelters would offer a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombers . In the present state of our civil defense an attack against us with high-yield weapons would be devastating . An attempt to evacuate a city like New York would clog all traffic arteries and prevent effective assistance being rendered . In the absence of shelters the casualties from heat and blast would be enormous . Without foreknowledge of the effects of fall-out , people might behave in precisely the manner calculated to bring about the highest level of casualties . An attempt to flee the fall-out area during the first two days of maximum radioactivity would expose an individual to the largest dosage of radiation . An insufficient awareness of the nature of radioactive contamination would multiply casualties . The absence of a tested communications system would put the population at the mercy of rumor and prevent any concerted effort to alleviate suffering . The psychological impact of a sudden thermonuclear blow against an unprepared population would prove even more pernicious . Since the physical effects of an all-out war waged with modern weapons will prove devastating , the individual will be confronted with the collapse of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered flow of life . To a considerable extent his reactions will depend on how well he has been prepared psychologically . A thermonuclear war which broke over a psychologically unprepared population might lead to a loss of faith in society and government . A comparable disaster which has been foreseen and provided against might actually serve to demonstrate the value of the existing network of social relationships . World War II // produced a much smaller social dislocation than did World War I , although the devastation it caused was at least as great , because it was entered with fewer illusions . The psychological crisis after World War I was caused as much by the incongruity between performance and aspiration as by the casualty lists . It rose as much out of the undermin-ing of faith in the ideal of a rational and harmonious world as out of the realities of trench warfare which made the previous expectations appear fatuous . It is important , therefore , to prepare a " familiar environ-ment " in advance of the catastrophe of all-out war , and to avert panic by discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of security have disappeared . A major effort should be made to train the American popu-lation in the most effective behavior in order to reduce casualties from fall-out and blast to the minimum . Great emphasis should be placed on creating an emergency com-munications system as immune as possible to nuclear attack , so that organized activity can be resumed at the earliest possible moment . Because the warning time available will become progres-sively shorter , falling to a maximum of twenty minutes in the missile age , and because of the perils of fall-out , pro-tection for the civilian population can be achieved , if at all , only by a program of deep shelters . Others have de-scribed a shelter program in detail , 16 but a few salient characteristics may be outlined here . Because of the short warning time likely to be available in the missile age , shel-ters should be so located that they can be reached in fifteen minutes ? the approximate time between the detection and the explosion of a missile . Because the high level of radio-activity immediately after an attack makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , water and medicine for several days . They should be connected with a central communications system , so that levels of radiation and instructions for cooperative be-havior can be communicated . Even simple home-shelters , // it has been estimated , should be able to reduce casualties by a significant percentage . ' ' Even with these precautions , the effect on society of a catastrophe on the scale of a thermonuclear attack must not be underrated . History suggests that suffering , if pressed beyond a certain point , inevitably leads to political or social transformations . Society can exact a measure of sacrifice as the price of maintaining itself , but excessive suf fering tends to tear the social fabric apart . However just a war may appear at the beginning , it may be ascribed in retrospect to inadequate leadership if the losses it causes are thought exorbitant . Within limits , civil defense can contribute to the cohesiveness of society in the face of massive shock . While it can not avert the traumatic effect of vast physical destruction , its efficient operation may make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse . Another source of grave peril is the growing Soviet submarine fleet . Germany entered World War II with 65 submarines , and even at the height of the war their num ber never exceeded loo . The German submarines were really submersible surface ships which could not cruise underwater for long periods . Yet even this fleet equipped only with conventional explosives nearly gained control of the Atlantic . At the end of the war the Soviet Union captured a num ber of German " Schnorkel " submarines capable of cruis ing underwater for long periods , and it has since built up its fleet to a total of perhaps 450 . After nuclear-powered submarines have been developed ? and , given the state of Soviet nuclear technology , this is only a question of time ? the Soviet Union will possess a " true " submarine craft which can remain submerged indefinitely and which can cruise underwater quietly and at high speed . By 1960 the Soviet Fleet may possess as many as 700 submarines of various types , including nuclear-powered submarines , most // of which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A force of this magnitude will pose a tremendous threat both to our allies and to our command of the seas . Submarines with 1,5oo-mile missiles will in effect be able to place any island under siege and threaten portions of the globe which are now immune to Soviet attack , such as Australia . They will add considerably to the Soviet strategic striking power even against the continental United States . Over 50 per cent of the population of the United States lives within three hundred miles of the coastline . Submarines with 1,5oo-mile missiles lying 500 miles offshore could cause fearful damage . To be sure , such an attack could not prevent our launching a devastating counterblow against the U.S.S.R. and would therefore not enable the Soviet Union to win an all-out war . But it will be an additional form of blackmail . It will increase the reluctance of the free world to run the risks of an allout war and may thereby paralyze resistance to aggression short of a direct onslaught on the United States . The large and growing Soviet submarine fleet will increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Submarines of the World War II type were highly vulnerable to surface vessels because of their slow speed , inferior armament , and lack of armor . In a battle between a well-armed surface vessel and a submarine , the former was almost inevitably the victor . For the submarine could sink its opponent only by a direct hit below the waterline and could launch its torpedoes only when close to the surface and therefore most vulnerable . Modern weapons have , however , equalized the relationship between submarines and surface vessels to a considerable extent . A direct hit anywhere with a nuclear weapon will sink any ship , however heavy its armor . A miss of several miles with a thermonuclear weapon may put the largest ship out of action . Even if the ship remains afloat , casualties to its personnel may cause it to become useless as an instrument of war . Modern submarines can no longer be out-run by surface ships and they are able to fire missiles from the depths of the sea . When anything that can be detected // can be sunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide , and here the submarine seems to have a decided advantage over the surface ship . Moreover , whatever restrictions on methods of warfare the combatants may accept explicitly or tacitly because of the mutual fear of destroying each other 's civil population , these will not apply in sea warfare . The largest weapon can be used at sea without fear of decimating populations . Against a submarine fleet of the size of the Soviet one , surface ships will have a very difficult time , particularly when submarines have learned to overcome their difficulty in locating targets , perhaps by using guided missiles . The Soviet leadership will then be able to employ its submarine fleet in support of peripheral aggressions , to interdict communications and to confront us with the dilemma of whether Soviet submarine activity is " worth " an all-out war . Against large-scale Soviet submarine activity , the Seventh Fleet , charged with protecting Formosa may , for example , be so occupied with purely defensive operations that it will not be able to carry out its primary mission . And unless the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early stages of a war , supply by sea of foreign bases and allies may become impossible . One of the most important tasks of United States strategy is , therefore , to develop an effective antisubmarine strategy . During the Symington hearings , the Navy argued that the best method for dealing with enemy submarines was to destroy their home ports by air attacks from carrier task forces . But such a strategy will probably not eliminate the submarine menace quickly enough and it may not prove possible to apply it in limited war.18 As the Soviet fleet of nuclear-powered submarines grows , a large number of long-range submarines can be kept constantly at sea . It may even be possible to develop civilian uses for submarines , such as carrying freight , which would make the presence of Soviet undersea craft near United States or allied shores " legitimate " and thus overload our detection apparatus . Because of the ability of these submarines 18 See below , Chapter 5 , p. 165 if. , for a discussion of the role of the submarine in limited war . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the enormous damage which can be caused by even one submarine equipped with nuclear weapons , it is essential to develop methods for destroying enemy submarines at sea as rapidly as possible in the event of war . As in air strategy , the submarine forces-in-being must be eliminated before they have done their damage . Attrition through the destruction of port facilities is not likely to be effective quickly enough to avert widespread devastation by submarines at sea when the war breaks out . The vulnerabilities of the United States to nuclear attack , while extremely serious , must be viewed in proper perspective . For the immediate future they are not likely to be so great as to tempt the Soviet leaders to undertake a surprise attack , either because the Soviet Long-Range Air Force is not yet sufficiently strong , or because some of our vulnerabilities , as in the field of civil defense , are matched by similar deficiencies in the U.S.S.R. Thus if we behave effectively we have time to make good our shortcomings . We should press more vigorously the dispersal of our Strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective civil defense organization . And we must develop new antisubmarine capabilities . If we carry out these measures , all of which lie in our own control , all-out war should remain an unattractive course for the U.S.S.R. v How will new technological developments affect the strategic equation of all-out war ? There has been a great deal of discussion about the possible consequences of technological breakthroughs which may be achieved by either side , and , given the current rate of technological change , this factor presents a real problem . Not every technological advance is a technological breakthrough , however . A considerable effort goes into simply keeping up in the technological race . An improved fighter plane may do no more than balance a new type of bomber without affecting the strategic equation . A technological breakthrough is an advance which either establishes a new // capability or improves an existing one to a point at which it can overwhelm the opposition . Thus the strategically significant technological breakthroughs are likely to occur in the relation between offense and defense : either through the discovery of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or through the development of an offense that can overwhelm the opposing defense and eliminate the retaliatory force before it has been launched . Our thinking about technological breakthroughs may , in any case , have been too much affected by the memory of our atomic monopoly . Then , to be sure , an unparalleled increase in power was coupled with our exclusive possession of the new discovery . Both of these conditions were almost unique in history . In the past , new inventions generally brought about only a slight increase in destructive capability ; gunpowder in its early stages was not significantly more destructive than the crossbow . And generally , the technological advance was available to several powers , even if for conceptual or political reasons they did not avail themselves of it . It is likely that the future impact of technology on strategy will approximate the traditional pattern rather than the dramatic discovery of nuclear weapons . A significant breakthrough has become technically much more difficult , not because major advances are no longer possible , but because they may add little to a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategically significant if it improved either the destructiveness of weapons or the speed and efficiency with which they could be delivered . In both of these categories the upper limit of what can be translated into strategic advantage has either been reached or is rapidly being approached . It is already the case that an increase in explosive power will pay hardly any strategic returns , for existing weapons are sufficiently powerful to encompass the destruction of even the largest area targets . And with the advent of intercontinental missiles , which can traverse a distance of 5,000 miles in less than half an hour , added speed may prove only marginally significant . // Henceforth , technology can assist strategy primarily by developing new applications for existing weapons , by combining them more efficiently and by developing subtler and more discriminating uses rather than by adding to their power and speed . In assessing the significance of new technological developments , it is necessary to examine the advantage they may give to the side which discovers them first , as well as the implications for strategy if both sides come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if both sides develop a new weapon at the same time . The almost simultaneous invention of the thermonuclear bomb improved the Soviet strategic position more than ours . Whereas we were already able to inflict devastating damage with nuclear weapons , the tremendous power of the new bomb enabled the Soviet Air Force to redress the balance between the two strategic striking forces with fewer planes . Similarly , an atomic submarine developed by the U.S.S.R. will pose a greater threat to an ocean-going nation like ours than to a landlocked power like the U.S.S.R. Are the technological developments which loom ahead likely to affect the strategic balance in an all-out war ? On the offensive side , two basic advances are in prospect : the nuclear-powered airplane and ballistic missiles . The advantage of the nuclear-powered plane is its extraordinary range , which will in fact be limited only by crew fatigue . ( The atom-powered submarine , " Nautilus , " for example , traveled 50,000 miles on its original supply of fuel . ) It will also probably be able to carry a heavier bomb load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is strategically of marginal significance . Such a plane would make our overseas bases less important and it would eliminate the need for aerial refueling . It would also greatly complicate the enemy 's problem of defense , for it could circle just outside the range of enemy detection and then attack at a moment 's notice . Because nuclear planes can remain aloft for such long periods , the vulnerability of the retaliatory force will be reduced by its ability to keep a larger percentage of its planes in the air at any given time . // Because a nuclear-powered striking force can attack from its training bases , it has a greater opportunity to achieve surprise . Nevertheless , the development of the nuclear airplane will not by itself upset the strategic balance . If we develop it first , it would simply enable us to do more efficiently and from the continental United States what we are already capable of achieving by aerial refueling and the use of overseas bases . It would not add a decisive increment to our strategic power . If the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would complicate our defensive problem . We would lose the warning time which is now conferred by the necessity for the Soviet forces to stage their planes to advanced bases . But the basic relationship described above would continue . The speed of the first family of nuclear planes is not likely to exceed that of the present family of jet planes . The Soviet LongRange Air Force , therefore , would still have to negotiate a band of 1,500-3,000 miles exposed to our air defense before they reach their targets . Our present detection system would thus probably continue to give us two to four hours of warning . In the most likely contingency that both sides possess nuclear planes concurrently , the effect will be that the increase in the possibility of surprise will be made up by the decreased vulnerability of the forces-in-being . Hence the stalemate in an all-out war is not likely to be broken by the introduction of nuclearpowered airplanes . This is all the more true because over the next ten years the defense is likely to be gaining relative to the manned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is still in its infancy , is certain to be spurred by research into the offensive uses of guided missiles . The speed of missiles is enormously greater than that of any manned plane now in prospect , and they can be launched in such quantities as to make the survival of manned bombers exceedingly difficult . They will soon possess atomic warheads which can destroy any plane within a cubic mile of air and , as nuclear technology advances , they can be engineered to encompass an ever bigger radius of destruc122 NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND FOREIGN POLICY Lion . The attrition rate of the air defense against manned planes , however powered , is likely to continue to rise . That rate is already sufficiently high so that a strategic attack carried out with conventional explosives would be uneconomical . And even thermonuclear attacks with manned planes may in time become very difficult . Long before this point is reached , however , a new family of offensive weapons will have been developed , which will pose extraordinarily difficult problems for the defense : the ballistic missiles of varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballistic missile pursues a fixed trajectory , analogous to that of an artillery shell . The ballistic missiles which will be used for strategic bombing are propelled by rockets : the first such weapon was the German V-2 of 1944-45 which had a range of about 200 miles . The distinguishing features of ballistic missiles are their speed and the altitude at which they fly . The highest point of the trajectory of the German V-2 was 50 nautical miles and its speed approached five times the speed of sound . An Intercontinental Ballistic Missile will fly at a speed twenty times that of sound , and will have a range in excess of 5,000 miles . Its transit time between Soviet and United States territories will be only about thirty minutes . Against this weapon our present detection apparatus will not be powerful enough and our air-defense system will have neither adequate weapons nor a sufficiently rapid reaction time . Do the ballistic missiles constitute a technological breakthrough , then ? It is necessary to distinguish the kind of missile ? whether of intercontinental or intermediary range ( around 1,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develops it first . If the Soviet Union develops a I , 5oo-mile missile first , it will not fundamentally upset the strategic balance . A 1,500-mile missile would be useful primarily for blackmailing our allies or threatening our overseas air bases . Both tasks can now be accomplished by Soviet light and medium jet bombers ( the " Beagle " and the " Badger " ) . To be sure , a I , 5oo-mile missile could carry out these missions more rapidly . It could reduce the warning time to practiESOTERIC // cally nothing and , if its aim were sufficiently accurate , it might make overseas air bases untenable . On the other hand , it could do so only by provoking an all-out war , and it could not avert a retaliatory blow against Soviet territories from bases in the United States . A 1,5oo-mile missile could not , therefore , decide an all-out war , although if launched from submarines it could wreak considerable havoc . Indeed , the major utility of a 1,5oo-mile missile for Soviet strategy may lie in a twilight zone of naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations just short of all-out war . Possession by us and our allies of a 1,5oo-mile missile would add substantially to our strategic capabilities . From present United States bases or from ships , a 1,5oo-mile missile could reach all of Soviet territory except a small portion of Asiatic Russia . Even if both sides should achieve a 1,5oo-mile missile concurrently , it would add more to our effective strength than to that of the Soviet bloc . In the possession of our allies , it might improve their ability to withstand Soviet atomic blackmail by enabling them to pose a similar counterthreat . Nevertheless , possession of a 1,5oo-mile missile will not confer a decisive advantage . Unless we strike the first blow , and perhaps not even then , the U.S.S.R. would still be able to launch a devastating attack against us . Moreover , the intermediaterange missile will probably not be available in sufficient quantity or with adequate accuracy before the development of another weapon , the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile , which will make it almost impossible for either side to achieve total victory through all-out war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missiles by 1961 and Intercontinental Missiles by 1963 . Even if one side develops one of these missiles a year or two before the other , the first prototypes will not have sufficient accuracy , and they will not exist in sufficient operational quantity to confer a decisive advantage . After 1963 both sides will possess increasing numbers of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles armed with thermonuclear warheads . The consequences of this development // will be paradoxical . While it will enable both sides to achieve complete surprise ? or reduce the period of warning under optimum conditions to twenty minutes ? it will also make it impossible to achieve any significant advantage through surprise . In a strategy based on manned bombers , the purpose of a surprise attack is to destroy the enemy 's bombers where they are most vulnerable ? on the ground . The apparatus for launching a bomber ? the airfield ? is so costly relative to an airplane that it must house a certain minimum number of planes in order to operate efficiently , and an upper limit is thus placed on the ability to disperse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer air bases than airplanes , the most efficient strategy in a war fought with manned bombers is to seek out and destroy the enemy 's forces-in-being on the ground by launching a surprise attack against them before they can take to the air . With the advent of ballistic missiles , however , dispersal will be almost complete . The launching mechanism of an Intercontinental Missile is less elaborate than an airfield . It is more maneuverable and easier to conceal or camouflage . When Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles exist in quantity , many of their launching sites will undoubtedly be underground ; others will be mobile . Under such conditions a surprise attack can have no purpose . It would be next to impossible to identify all launching sites or to destroy them , if identified . Even the maximum of surprise could at best destroy the opponent 's national substance ; it would not eliminate his ability to inflict a retaliatory blow of similar power . All-out war could still be devastating , but it could no longer achieve its purpose ? the destruction of the opponent 's retaliatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more invulnerable to surprise attack and to defense systems , the real contest in an all-out war will be between the vulnerabilities and the resiliency of the opposing societies . If an aggressor became convinced that a sudden blow might dissolve the fabric of our society while his own // society would remain intact , he might be willing to risk all-out war despite the severe damage he would suffer in return . As the strategy shifts from an attempt to eliminate forces-in-being to a conscious attempt to disrupt society , a great premium is placed on the civil defense measures outlined above . In the age of the ballistic missile the known ability of a society to withstand a severe attack will become an increasingly important deterrent . When no strategic advantage can be gained from additional offensive power , superiority can be achieved , if at all , only through an improved protection of the population . Nevertheless , while such a course is essential to conserve as much of the human resources as possible , it does not suffice to make all-out war a rational policy choice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little can be done to avoid widespread physical devastation , and even the best shelter program would not reduce civilian casualties below the point of major disaster . vI Whatever the calculation , then , whether it be based on the feasibility of a surprise attack with present weapons and delivery systems or on the impact of imminent technological trends , it is difficult to see how either side can count on achieving its objectives through all-out war . It is possible to calculate relative advantages in base structure or delivery capabilities , but they do not add up to a margin which would leave either side sufficient resources to impose its will . The essence of the nuclear stalemate is that it keeps the two superpowers from launching an all-out war because each can force the other to pay an exorbitant price for victory . The speed and power of modern weapons has thus brought about a paradoxical consequence : henceforth the only outcome of an all-out war will be that both contenders must lose . Under almost any foreseeable circumstances , an upper limit of destruction will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , long before that point is reached , the forces-in-being on // both sides will have inflicted losses completely disproportionate to any objective which is likely to be the original purpose of the war . Nuclear stalemate should , therefore , not be confused with nuclear parity . It comes about because , after a certain point , superiority in destructive power no longer pays strategic returns . In such a situation deterrence becomes a complex problem . From now on the decision between peace and war , never an easy one , will be complicated by the consciousness that all-out war entails the risk of national catastrophe . Obviously no power will start a war it thinks it is going to lose . But it will also be reluctant to start a war if the price may be its national substance . All-out war is therefore likely to turn into a last resort : an act of desperation to be invoked only if national survival is unambiguously threatened . And what constitutes an unambiguous threat will be interpreted with increasing rigidity as the risks of all-out war become better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a protection against a sudden onslaught on the territorial United States . It also poses risks which may make the decision to initiate war for any lesser objective increasingly difficult . The nuclear stalemate may prevent all-out war . It will not deter other forms of conflict ; in fact it may even encourage them . The side which can present its challenges in less than an all-out form thereby gains a psychological advantage . It can shift to its opponent the agonizing choice of whether a challenge which explicitly stops short of all-out war should be dealt with by total retaliation . If the decision to engage in all-out war is going to be difficult for the United States , it will be next to impossible for most of our allies . We have , for a little while at least , the protection of distance . While this can not avert a heavy attack , it can at least provide a measure of warning and it permits some degree of defense . Most of Europe , however , is only some forty minutes ' flying time from advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in light and medium jet bombers . Moreover , while the size of the United States makes it at least conESOTERIC // ceivable that our society could withstand a thermonuclear onslaught , both history and geography combine to cast doubt on Europe 's ability to do so . Thermonuclear devastation , coming after the ravages of two world wars , might lead to the collapse of the European social structure . And the density of Europe 's population would involve fearful casualties . A minister who knows that a small number of megaton weapons properly distributed could kill or injure over half the population of his country will not resort to all-out war except as a very last resort ? and perhaps not even then . Finally , the nuclear stalemate affects not only relations among the nuclear powers but their relations to powers which do not have a nuclear establishment . At a time when the relations between the two great powers are increasingly shaped by the awareness that their thermonuclear capability enables them to avoid defeat but not to achieve a meaningful victory , the role of the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superpowers . This is true not only because the rivalry of the two blocs endows the uncommitted nations with an increased importance . It is equally due to the fact that vis-a-vis the underdeveloped countries the modern weapons confer no meaningful increase of strength . Because the underdeveloped areas are hopelessly inferior to the major powers , even in terms of conventional technology , they will not be impressed by the fact that nuclear weapons make it possible to encompass their destruction even more efficiently than before . Although the margin of superiority of the industrialized over the underdeveloped nations has never been greater , it has also never been less effective . In every crisis from Korea to Suez , the nonnuclear powers have behaved as if nuclear technology did not exist . They could do so because they knew that two considerations would inhibit the major powers : the consciousness that the employment of nuclear weapons would bring about a feeling of moral revulsion in the rest of the world , and the fear that the employment of nuclear weapons anywhere might set off a chain of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor powers are in a sense insulated from the nuclear age by the incommensurability between the power of nuclear weapons and the objectives for which they might be employed , as well as by the inhibitions which are gen erated by a major reliance on an all-out strategy . All-out war has therefore ceased to be a meaningful in trument of policy . It can not be used against the minor powers for fear of the reaction of world opinion and also because its intricate strategy is not appropriate to wars of limited objectives . And it can not be used against a major power for anything except negative ends : to prevent the opponent 's victory . Thus an all-out war which starts as an all-out war is the least likely contin gency , although it is the only one for which we have an adequate doctrine . To be sure , an all-out war could come about as the result of an irrational decision or of a mis calculation or because a small war may gradually spread . There is no protection against irrational decision except to deprive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a possibility which ended with our atomic monopoly . Mis calculation and the gradual spreading of little wars will be considered in a later chapter , although , with national catas trophe the penalty for miscalculation , all the pressures will operate on the side of caution . The fact remains that under present or foreseeable conditions it is difficult to think of a national purpose that could be advanced by all-out war . This is not to say that we can afford to be without a capability for fighting an all-out war , or that it will be easy to maintain the conditions which will make such a war seem unattractive to an opponent . Obviously , if we do not retain a well-protected capability for massive retalia tion , the calculus of risks described in this chapter with respect to all-out war would shift . An opponent might then consider it worth the gamble to launch a surprise attack against us . It does mean , however , that , if we be-have effectively , we can always make the risks of all-out war seem prohibitive to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether there is go ing to be an all-out war will depend to a large exESOTERIC // tent on us . Whether we keep up in the technological race , whether our retaliatory force is well dispersed , whether our air defense exacts the maximum attrition and our civil defense is capable of preventing panics ? all these decisions are within our exclusive control . But although these conditions are within our control they will not be easy to achieve . At the current rate of technological change the side which has conceded the first blow to its enemy will always live on the verge of catastrophe , for an adverse technological breakthrough is always possible . Thus the stalemate for all-out war is inherently precarious . It will impel a continuous race between offense and defense , and it will require a tremendous effort on our part simply to stay even . It is the complexity of maintaining the nuclear stalemate which gives its esoteric quality to much of our military thought . The military must plan on the basis of the opponent 's capabilities , and in a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first instance to guard against the worst contingency , which is an all-out war . This leads to the concern with surprise attack , with destroying the enemy 's forces-in-being , with all the eventualities that are least likely to occur . As a result , high-powered detection apparatuses sweep the skies along thousands of miles of perimeter . Hundreds of planes are poised on airfields ready to hurtle into the sky . A fearful responsibility falls on an ever smaller group of men : the individuals who have to interpret the information gathered by the detection systems . Is an unidentified flight of planes a strayed training mission , a reconnaissance effort , or the precursor of a surprise attack ? On the correct answer to this question depend the lives of tens of millions on both sides . And , given the speed of modern weapons , there is no margin for error . There will not even be the moral consolation that a Soviet surprise attack will appear unambiguous to world opinion . Given the distribution of the base system , our retaliatory blow is likely to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets after crossing the Distant Early Warning Line . // Because all-out war is so intricate and so sophisticated , and because its risks are so fearful , the necessary concern with it leads to a psychological distortion : it tends to trans-form the modes of a war which can only be a last resort into a doctrine for the only feasible strategy ; it leads our military and political leaders to identify each technological advance with strategically significant progress . In every crisis , short of direct Soviet attack , it furnishes arguments for a policy of minimum risk , not only because of the dan gers of all-out war but also to reserve our all-out capa bility either for a principal enemy or to meet a less ambiguous challenge . In the process , the relationship between policy and strategy tends to be lost . The more stark the consequences of all-out war , the more reluctant the responsible political leaders will be to employ force . They may invoke our all-out capability as a deterrent , but they will shrink from it as a strategy for conducting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an all-out strategy , the more the responsible policy-makers will come to be lieve that no cause except a direct attack on the United States justifies the use or the threat of force and that the Soviet leadership is equally strongly motivated to avoid all-out war . This dilemma is well illustrated by the Symington hear ings . The military leaders , particularly of the Air Force , described Soviet power as if all options were equally open to the Kremlin and as if every increase in Soviet air strength were immediately translatable into a strategic advantage . Secretary Wilson , however , insisted that the growing Soviet nuclear stockpile and its expanding Long-Range Air Force were less significant than the transformation of Soviet society toward a more peaceful outlook.19 Thus an exclusive concern with a war fought on the basis of " purely " military considerations stimulates , as its counter-part , an emphasis on " pure ' diplomacy , or a reliance on historical trends . The counterpart to " massive retaliation " is a belief that diplomacy can settle disputes through the // processes of negotiation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a consequence , the crucial problem of modern strategy is rarely considered explicitly : what kind of military superiority is strategically significant , and what strategy can give an impetus to policy rather than paralyze it . The dilemma which has been pointed up by the Symington hearings has been defined as the choice between Armageddon and defeat without war . The enormity of modern weapons makes the thought of all-out war repugnant , but the refusal to run any risks would amount to handing the Soviet leaders a blank check . We can overcome the paralysis induced by such prospects only if our strategy can pose less absolute alternatives to our policymakers . To be sure , we require at all times a capability for all-out war so great that by no calculation could an aggressor hope to destroy us by a surprise attack . But we must also realize that a capability for all-out thermonuclear war can only avert disaster . It can not be employed to achieve positive ends . We thus return to the dilemma which has plagued all our postwar military thinking . Does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diplomacy ? Is it possible to imagine applications of power less catastrophic than all-out thermonuclear war ? 5 WHAT PRICE DETERRENCE ? THE PROBLEMS OF LIMITED WAR PERHAPS THE BASIC PROBLEM of strategy in the nuclear age is how to establish a relationship between a policy of deterrence and a strategy for fighting a war in case deter rence fails . From the point of view of its impact on the aggressor 's actions , maximum deterrence can be equated with the threat of maximum destructiveness . From the point of view of a power 's readiness to resist aggression , the optimum strategy is one which is able to achieve its goals at minimum cost . The temptation of strategic doc trine is to seek to combine the advantages of every course of action : to achieve maximum deterrence but also to do so at minimum risk . Ever since the end of our atomic monopoly , however , this effort has been thwarted by the impossibility of com bining maximum destructiveness with limited risk . The greater the horror of our destructive capabilities , the less certain has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In such circumstances deterrence is brought about not only by a physical but also by a psychological relationship : deterrence is greatest when military strength is coupled with the willingness to employ it . It is achieved when one side 's readiness to run risks in relation to the other is high ; it is least effective when the willingness to run risks is low , however powerful the military capability . It is , therefore , no longer possible to speak of military superiority in the abstract . What does " being ahead " in the nuclear race mean if each side can already destroy the other 's national 132 // substance ? What is the strategic significance of adding to the destructiveness of the nuclear arsenal when the enormity of present weapons systems already tends to paralyze the will ? It is the task of strategic doctrine to strike a balance between the physical and the psychological aspects of deterrence , between the desire to pose a maximum threat and the reality that no threat is stronger than the belief of the opponent that it will in fact be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to confront will induce either inaction or improvisation . A strategy which establishes a superior balance between power arid-will may then gain a crucial advantage , because it per'nits initiative and shifts to the other side the risks inherent in making countermoves . The reliance on all-out war as the chief deterrent inhibits the establishment of this balance . By identifying deterrence with maximum power it tends to paralyze the will . Its concern with the physical basis of deterrence neglects the psychological aspect . Given the power of modern weapons , a nation that relies on all-out war as its chief deterrent imposes a fearful psychological handicap on itself . The most agonizing decision a statesman can face is whether or not to unleash all-out war ; all pressures will make for hesitation , short of a direct attack threatening the national existence . In any other situation he will be inhibited by the incommensurability between the cost of the war and the objective in dispute . And he will be confirmed in his hesitations by the conviction that , so long as his retaliatory force remains intact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus both the horror and the power of modern weapons tend to paralyze action : the former because it will make few issues seem worth contending for ; the latter because it causes many disputes to seem irrelevant to the over-all strategic equation . The psychological equation , therefore , will almost inevitably operate against the side which can extricate itself from a situation only by the threat of all-out war . Who can be certain that , faced with the catastrophe // of all-out war , even Europe , long the keystone of our security , will seem worth the price ? As the power of modern weapons grows , the threat of all-out war loses its credibility and therefore its political effectiveness . Our capacity for massive retaliation did not avert the Korean war , the loss of northern Indo-China , the Soviet-Egyptian arms deal , or the Suez crisis . A deterrent which one is afraid to implement when it is challenged ceases to be a deterrent . Moreover , whatever the credibility of our threat of all-out war , it is clear that allout thermonuclear war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus a psychological gap is created by the conviction of our allies that they have nothing to gain from massive retaliation and by the belief of the Soviet leaders that they have nothing to fear from our threat of it . This gap may actually encourage the Soviet leaders to engage in aggression . The destructiveness of nuclear weapons having made it unlikely that any responsible statesman will lightly unleash a general war , one of the gravest dangers of all-out war lies in miscalculation . This is the only war which it is within our power to avoid , assuming we leave no doubt concerning our capabilities and our determination . But even this " avoidable " war may break out if the other side becomes convinced that we can not interfere locally and that our threats of all-out war are bluff . If that should happen , the Soviet bloc may then decide , as its nuclear arsenal grows , to absorb the peripheral areas of Eurasia by means short of all-out war and to confront us with the choice of yielding or facing the destruction of American cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their assessment of our reaction to such a contingency , the reliance on " massive retaliation " may bring about the total war it seeks to prevent . To be sure , a threat to be effective need not be absolutely credible . An aggressor may be reluctant to stake his national existence for a marginal gain even if he should have some doubts about whether a threat will in fact be implemented . It has even been argued that a reduction // of our forces around the Soviet periphery would multiply Soviet hesitations because it would make clear to the Soviet leaders , beyond doubt , that any aggression may involve all-out war.l And for purposes of deterrence , so the argument goes , what we may do will prove as effective as what we will do . Such a strategy , however , would be highly risky and demoralizing . It would widen the gap between the psy-chological and physical components of policy even more . It is a strange doctrine which asserts that we can convey our determination to our opponent by reducing our over-seas commitments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effective deterrent than our deeds . It overlooks that all Soviet and Chinese aggressive moves have occurred in areas where our commitment of resources was small or nonexistent : Korea , Indo-China and the Middle East . Above all , a strategy which sought to compensate for its lack of plausibility by posing ever more fearful threats would be demoralizing . It would place control over our survival entirely in the hands of another power , for any Soviet move , however trivial , would force us to re-spond , if at all , by what may amount to national suicide . It ignores the contemporary revolution which , as events in the Middle East and the satellite orbit have shown , may create its own tensions independent of the plans of the major powers and which may force the United States and the U.S.S.R. to contest certain areas despite them-selves . This is another way of saying that the threat of all-out war purchases deterrence at an exorbitant risk . It requires us in every crisis to stake our survival on the credibility of a threat which we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will force us into the kind of war our strategy should make every attempt to avoid . The costs of all-out war are too fearful for it to be our only response to a challenge . Even if it could be won , we should seek to achieve our objectives at smaller // sacrifice . Strategy can assist policy only by developing a maximum number of stages between total peace ( which may mean total surrender ) and total war . It can increase the willingness of policy-makers to run risks only if it can demonstrate other means of preventing amputations than the threat of suicide . The power of modern weapons has thus set our statesmanship a problem unique in our history : that absolute security is no longer possible . Whatever the validity of the identification of deterrence with maximum retaliatory power , we will have to sacrifice a measure of destructiveness to gain the possibility of fighting wars that will not amount to national catastrophe . Policy , it has been said , is the science of the relative . The same is true of strategy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national experience , is the task history has set our generation . II What strategic doctrine is most likely to enable us to avoid the dilemma of having to make a choice between all-out war and a gradual loss of positions , between Armageddon and defeat without war ? Is limited war a conceivable instrument of policy in the nuclear period ? Here we must analyze precisely what is meant by limited war . It is a historical accident reflecting the nature of our foreign involvements that we should have come to consider limited war an aberration from the " pure " case and that we have paid little attention to its strategic opportunities . In a sense this is due , too , to the manner in which we have legitimized the limited wars which we have fought . Every war in which we have been engaged in the Western Hemisphere was a limited war , in the sense that it did not involve a mobilization of all our material resources . But since we generally justified them as expeditions , punitive or otherwise , they rarely entered our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our wars in the Western Hemisphere illustrate , however , that limited wars have been both more frequent and more // productive than the disputes generated by the Korean war indicate . The debate which has since raged on the subject of limited war has tended to confuse the issues because it has not sufficiently distinguished between the various forms of limited war . Some wars are inherently limited because of the disparity in power between the protagonists . A war between the United States and Nicaragua would not require more than a fraction of our strength whatever the objectives we set ourselves . Such a war would be all-out in relation to Nicaragua , but limited with respect to us . Another variation of this form of limited war occurs when the stronger power is restrained from exerting its full potential by moral , political or strategic considerations . This was the case in the Korean war , in which the Chinese probably made the maximum military effort of which they were capable while we , for a variety of reasons , limited our commitment . Still another kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty of supply prevents one side from making a total effort . An example of this is the Russo-Japanese war of 1905 in which the Russian commitment was limited to the forces that could be supplied over a single-track railway . Finally there may occur limited wars between major powers which are kept from spreading by a tacit agreement between the contestants and not by difficulties of technology or of logistics . If one inquires which of these tyRes of limited war are possible in the present situation , four broad categories can be distinguished . The first includes wars between secondary powers , such as between Israel and Egypt or between India and Pakistan , whether or not they involve the danger of the major powers joining in . The second type consists of wars involving either the Western powers or the Soviet bloc against powers which are clearly outmatched and under circumstances in which outside intervention is not likely . Examples of this would be Soviet intervention in the satellites , or United States military action in the Western Hemisphere . A third category are conflicts which begin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may involve the prospect of spreading as in the case // of a Chinese move against South Vietnam or the AngloFrench " police action " against Egypt . Finally , there is the problem of limited war which begins explicitly as a war between the major powers . This is obviously the most explosive situation . If a war between major powers can be kept limited , it is clear that the first three situations would also stand a good chance of being kept from expanding . In the history of warfare , limited wars between major powers have been a frequent occurrence . For a long time , however , they remained limited less by conscious choice than by considerations of domestic policy . In the seventeenth century Louis XIV employed almost his entire army for a period of close to twenty-five years . Still his military establishment utilized only a small proportion of the national resources because of a domestic structure which prevented him from conscripting his subjects , levying income taxes , or confiscating property . His military establishment was therefore limited by the availability of resources and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , the wars of Prussia , without exceeding those of France in scope , required a far greater mobilization of the national resources . Because of Prussia 's limited resources , it was able to survive as a major power only by organizing the entire state for war . But Prussia 's exertions only gave it a precarious parity with the other powers ; it did not force them to emulate it . Wars remained limited because the major powers were able to mobilize only a small proportion of their national resources for war and because Prussia , the one power which was not so restrained , did not thereby gain a decisive advantage . Since the French Revolution the domestic restrictions on the capacity of governments to mobilize national resources have increasingly disappeared . And this has occurred simultaneously with an industrial revolution which has made it technically possible to devote a substantial proportion of the national product to war without imposing a degree of privation which would shake the social order . To be sure , there still exist differences in the willingness of governments to exact sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness to devote a much // larger proportion of the national income to military ex penditures than the United States . But for purposes of present strategy it is clear that no major power will be forced to adopt a strategy of limited objectives because of insufficient resources . With modern weapons , a limited war becomes an act of policy , not of necessity . What , under modern conditions , is a limited war ? One can think of many models . It may be a war confined to a defined geographic area , or a war that does not utilize the entire available weapons system ( such as refraining from the use of thermonuclear weapons ) . It may be a war which utilizes the entire weapons system but limits its employ ment to specific targets . But none of these military defini tions seems adequate . A war may be confined to a geographic area and yet be total in the sense of draining the national substance , as happened to France in World War I. The fact that the most destructive weapons are not employed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no guarantee against excessive suffering . In the Thirty Years ' War the power of weapons was negligible compared to modern armaments and the number of men in each army was small by present-day standards ? the Austrian Field Marshal Montecuccoli put at 15,000 the absolute maximum that could be commanded efficiently in one army.2 Yet it is estimated that the population of Germany was reduced by 30 percent during its course . A new world war fought with what are now called conven tional weapons would also produce appalling casualties since the destructive power even of these weapons has in-creased between five- and tenfold since World War II . In short , there exists no way to define a limited war in purely military terms . The end result of relying on purely military considerations is certain to be all-out war : the at-tempt to render the enemy defenseless . Such a strategy is an attempt to resolve by force the frustration pro duced by the fact that foreign policy seems much less tractable than domestic policy . Domestic policy is limited only by technical feasibility and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
