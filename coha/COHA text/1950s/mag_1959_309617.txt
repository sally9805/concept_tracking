Splendidly displayed in the " Jungle-gym " designed by George Nelson , U.S. art at the Moscow exhibition is drawing upward of 20,000 people a day . Guards have a hard time keeping the crowd moving , not because people are impressed by the show so much as because puzzlement halts them . Jackson Pollock 's drip picture called Cathedral stops visitors cold . " Where is the cathedral ? " they ask . Andrew Wyeth 's Children 's Doctor and Edward Hooper 's stark , vivid Lighthouse at Two Lights are the standout favorites . Among the sculptures on display , Gaston Lachaise 's hugely curvaceous Standing Woman is a cynosure .

" <P> The extraordinary breadth and variety of the exhibition made the unmistakable point that creative people vary , and that when they get the chance to create according to their own lights , they will produce variety and vitality along with a broad range of quality , from awful to wonderful . If the show made that point to the Russians , whose own official art amounts to hack illustrations of a deadly sameness , the U.S. might well rest content . <P> Nowhere did American freedom of thought have greater impact than in the presence of the show 's contentious curator , Manhattan Art Dealer Edith Gregor Halpert . Last month Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the exhibition ( " Some people think the President 's paintings are n't so good either . It 's like Truman saying modern art resembles ham and eggs " ) . One Soviet critic jeeringly asked her what had happened to the woman who criticized the President 's judgment . " I am that woman , " she said . The Russian was incredulous : " How did they ever let you out of the country after what you said ? "
