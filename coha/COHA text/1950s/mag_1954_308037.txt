Today 's fiction may be corrupting the morals of youth-but not for the reason most people think . It is not the sex , says Novelist J. B. Priestley in the New Statesman and Nation , it 's the sadism . <P> In recent years , says Priestley , both Britain and the U.S. have been deluged with books that " describe , with a gusto missing from the rest of their narratives , scenes that descend to the depths of atrocity . Moreover , they ask not only for our interest , but for our admiration . It is not just the villains who smash noses , gouge eyes , and beat people to a jelly ; the heroes do it too , and indeed are handier at it than the villains . . . <P> " This is not a good dream life to offer adolescent lads . . . The hero is what they would like to be . Outwardly he is everything they are not : tall , broad-shouldered , very strong , very brave , attractive to the girls . . . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Hero for thousands of years . . . But we might see to it that the Hero is not so often kicking people in the stomach and then smashing their faces into red pulp . . . It will be as well if the citizens of tomorrow do not take it for granted that people they dislike should be beaten , pounded , minced . The red-pulp view of life should be discouraged . <P> " If some of our cleaners-up would stop thinking about sex and take a look at this violent cruel stuff , they might yet do us a service . . . Nine youngsters out of ten will sooner or later discover sex for themselves . . . but this cruel violence is something else . It is by no means an essential part of us . No doubt there is in us the germ of it , a spark of savagery , especially in youth . One of the aims of civilisation is to smother that spark . . . But here in this popular fiction the whole civilised trend is being carefully reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners . There is in much of our early fiction-in Fielding and Smollett , for example-a lot of rough-and-tumble , knockabout brutality , as much a reflection of its time as Hogarth 's pictures were . But this new violence , with its sadistic overtones , is quite different . It is not simply coarse , brutal from a want of refinement and nerves , but genuinely corrupt , fundamentally unhealthy and evil . It does not suggest the fairground , the cattle market , the boxing booth , the horseplay of exuberant young males . It smells of concentration camps and the basements of secret police . There are screaming nerves in it . Its father is not an animal maleness , but some sort of diseased manhood , perverted and rotten . . . "
