" <P> At a sizzling swing concert in Britain 23 years ago , Trumpeter Louis ( " Satchmo " ) Armstrong recalls , he interrupted himself to roll his eyes toward a royal box and rasp : " This one 's for you .

Bedeviled by censorship in her earlier days , Playwright West ( Sex , Pleasure Man ) is now , strangely , all for watchdogs over public morality : " Why , if it was n't for censors , there 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally complete depravity .
