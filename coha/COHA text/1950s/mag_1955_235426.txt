Ever since movies were first produced in the Soviet Union , their main points have been lifted from the party line . " Down with bourgeois decadence ! " cried the hero , and the heroine cried back , " Long live collective farms and the Five-Year Plan ! " But a couple of new notes have recently crept into Soviet movies . One is love , another material success . <P> The long-live-love note was struck this month in Paris when the Russians showed seven of their latest and best films at three Paris theaters to celebrate Soviet Film Week . The purpose : to show Soviet film wares in a Paris showcase and put Russian movies back in the world market . <P> On opening night , with the French interested in a film-exchange deal , the week got an impressive official sendoff . The plush Normandie Theater on the Champs Elysees was flanked by rows of Gardes Republicans in scarlet-trimmed uniforms . The band blared the Marseillaise and the Internationale , and into the theater flocked French and Russian officials with a cluster of bejeweled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on necklines . <P> <P> The best of the Soviet offerings was The Cicada ( Mosfilm ) , an adaptation of a Chekhov story . It is a relentless dissection of a frivolous woman with delusions of culture , and of the effete salon riffraff that surrounded her in the days of the Czar . For the days of the commissars , the Soviets did less well , e.g. , An Unfinished Novel ( Lenfilm ) , in which all the resources of Soviet medicine fail to cure a paralyzed engineer , but when the girl doctor of his dreams rushes to his bedside in the last reel , he walks again . <P> A realistic desire to lift their production from about 40 movies a year to 150 in the next two years has forced Russian moviemakers to bend the party line .
