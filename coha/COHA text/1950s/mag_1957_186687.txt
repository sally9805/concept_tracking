" It is evening . The streets of Moscow are bright with lights . In the crowds you notice suddenly the face of a woman . She has an artful smile and a nonchalant manner . The woman walks slowly along the sidewalk and looks men in the eye . Later at the police station we meet Nadezhda M. She is in no way ashamed . Finally she is free , for one can not put her in jail . There is no specific law . " <P> - Moscow Trud <P> There is no specific law against prostitution in the Soviet Union or in the Soviet satellite countries , because the founders of Soviet socialism , Marx , Engels and Lenin , held that prostitution was a capitalist evil which simply could not exist in their " new system of social justice . " <P> Faithful to the dogma of his masters , Stalin refused to recognize that prostitution flourished in the Soviet Union ( he , says a recent Communist commentator , " professed the famous principle that if the facts do not conform to the thesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to blame-and woe to those who point out the facts " ) . When caught , Soviet prostitutes are sometimes sent to prison camps , but no laws or regulations exist under which the embarrassing problem can be rationally dealt with . Said Trud last February : " Are these women not breaking a basic law of Socialism , ' He who does not work does not eat , ' and is it not time that steps were taken to punish these people ? " <P> Soaring Syphilis . Trud 's article , one of the rare admissions that prostitution does indeed exist under Soviet socialism , has been echoed in the satellite states . A Hungarian magazine recently asserted that there are 10,000 prostitutes in Budapest . In Poland , according to Radio Gdansk , there are 230,000 professionals . In a survey of Communism 's old " ostrichlike policy , " Salomon Lastik in Nowa Kultura reports that half of the prostitutes in Warsaw are below 25 years of age and of these one in three is not yet 18 , proving them " a generation which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland . " Most juvenile prostitutes Lastik describes as the victims of " the prudishness of many persons emphasizing their ' socialism . ' " He found that " over 80% of prostitutes were from working-class or peasant families which are pitiless for every moral slip . The unfortunate daughter is expelled from her home and her fellow workers turn against her . " The syphilis rate is more than twice what it was in Poland three years ago , largely because " after the official statement that prostitution had been liquidated a number of venereal disease dispensaries closed down .
