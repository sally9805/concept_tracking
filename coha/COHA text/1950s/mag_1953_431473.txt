 | CERVANTES ? Author of the world 's First Great Novel By Donald Culross Peattie IN THE CENTER of Spain , the part called La Mancha , the plain lies 11 like a huge page open to the sky . It seems empty , save for a few villages , a few shepherds and their flocks . But if you are acquainted with the most-read work of fiction in the world you will not find this place empty . For you , too , it will be crowded with the more than 600 characters who troop across the pages of the first great novel ever written , Don Quixote de la Mancha . There on the plain you can see the very windmills , centuries old now , which the knight took to be giants . Filled with splendid fury to do fine deeds , he spurred his old nag on to charge them , only to be tossed on his head . " Tilting at windmills , " we call it to this day , when anyone zealously attacks an imaginary enemy . And the wonderful mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for any man may show a streak of the " quixotic . " The windmill incident is only one of hundreds , some slapstick , some sadly true , some truly sad , which fill this " bible of humanity . " And through all these adventures runs a vein of philosophic wisdom which was life 's one real reward to the author , Miguel de Cervantes . You can hear his laughing voice in his own description of himself at the time he was writing this classic : " Of aquiline features , chestnut hair , smooth and unruffled forehead , gay eyes , nose that is crooked but well proportioned , a heard silvered now but golden a mere 20 years ago , big moustachios , little mouth , only six teeth and they in bad shape and worse arrangement , complexion  | light , somewhat heavy in build , and rather slow on his feet . " He came into this world , of which he was to see so much , in 1547 , in the fine old university town of Alcala de Henares , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Valladolid , Seville , Madrid . For Papa Cervantes possessed a coat of arms and little else ; his profession of apothecary-surgeon brought him few patients who paid . Miguel 's first recollection was of seeing his father snatch up household gear and rush with it to the pawnbroker ; then the sheriff came to clap Papa Cervantes in debtors ' prison , leaving his daughters , Andrea and Luisa , and their two little brothers to weep with hunger . Somehow the boy Miguel got schooling . He may even have attended the University of Salamanca , working his way as valet to rich undergraduates . A novelist , though , learns his trade from life itself . And in the city streets Miguel learned it as it comes , harsh , unexpected , vivid with experience . In the theater , where he spent what money he could scrape up , he learned what life is when it is turned to art . He discovered the power of make-believe , and how it can create a truth greater than actuality . All he had , at 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made his way to Italy , where Spain maintained large garrisons , and there enlisted in the army . At last he was well dressed , in a uniform gaudy as a rooster 's , and for the first time he ate regularly . These years in the service color many a later page , when the old soldier remembers with relish the fine old inns , the gurgling Italian wine , the pretty girls . And he knew war itself . It was the Turk then who was the aggressor , and all Christendom stood in peril . A mighty Turkish fleet ; in 1571 , was sweeping westward through the Mediterranean . Selim II , Turkey 's sultan , meant to tear the Cross from St. Peter 's in Rome and raise the Crescent there . Spain sent her ships , under Don Juan of Austria ( half-brother to her king , Philip II ) , to join those of the Papal States and Venice ; on one of them sailed young Miguel de Cervantes . At Lepanto , off the coast of Greece , the fleet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle ever yet fought . Eight thousand Christians perished , 25,000 Turks , as ship after ship went down , while the soldiers fought cutlass to cutlass on the reeling decks . When the battle first was joined Cervantes lay below , tossing with malarial fever . He dashed on deck ; a moment later two shots hit him in the chest , a third shattered his left arm . Yet he was with the first to board the nearest Turkish vessel . The Crescent that day sank in a bloody moonset . It was Spain 's finest hour , and Cervantes ' proudest . Leaving Italy in 1575 , Miguel set sail for Spain with high hopes . In his pocket he had a letter of recommendation from Don Juan to King Philip , which he trusted to  | bring him some good government post . But the luckless voyagers were overhauled by Moorish pirates and carried off into slavery in Algiers . There , though his maimed hand spared him the galleys , Miguel became the property of Dali Mami , a renegade Christian turned pirate . When this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his prisoner was a man of importance , and ordered him to send to Spain for a large ransom . As the months dragged by , Miguel saw his fellows die in dungeons ; he saw girls exposed for sale in the markets . He witnessed floggings and flayings , and beheld the dangling corpses of those who had tried to escape . Through it all he was the support and leader of his fellow captives . He fought off their despair ; he organized , more than once , a break for freedom . Each time he was defeated , but when he was sentenced to death his own courage rescued him . For , cruel though these Moslem tyrants were , they admired utter bravery and , when Cervantes stood before his master with folded arms and lifted chin and defiantly took upon himself all blame for the plots to escape , he won his life . But not until he had suffered five years of captivity could his family in Spain scrape up enough to rescue Miguel . And when he finally went forth it was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had a prisoner stood so unbowed . Thus in 1580 Cervantes at last kissed the soil of Spain ? and learned how soon the world forgets a maimed veteran . While he waited vain years for preferment , he tried his hand at writing . But in the attempt to be elegant his book was only artificial  --  a " pastoral " called Galatea , about stilted shepherds and coquettish shepherdesses , which brought its author just enough money to buy a suit of wedding clothes and settle Too ducats on his bride . The girl , Catalina de Palacios Salazar y Vozmediano , was young , and she brought a dowry of some olive trees and vineyards , a few beehives and a share of the family farm implements . A good catch , perhaps , for some young peasant . But Catalina 's new husband was nearly twice her age , and meant to scribble . He took her to Madrid and there , in the bohemian company of actors , writers and producers , she was miserable . As their marriage slipped into failure Cer- 89 vantes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the theater . His plays made just enough money to encourage him to write others . He tossed off a score of them , not one a real success . Then onto the stage strode a young writer , Lope de Vega , who in 24 hours could turn out a box-office hit . Cervantes was crowded out of the theater , hurt and jealous . Then , he says , " I hung up my pen , " to take any employment offered . That proved to be the job of the best-hated fellow among us ? the tax collector . He was also engaged to gather supplies for the great Armada which King Philip was readying to fight England . " Spain is already singing of victory , " wrote Cervantes exultantly , and in a spirit of patriotism steeled his heart to wring from towns and villages around Seville their stores of wheat , olive oil , wine and pork . But Cervantes soon found himself behind jail bars . The trouble was that he could not do arithmetic ; perfectly honest , he had got his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fined 6000 reals . Then , worried about carrying large sums in collected taxes , he deposited these with a Sevillian banker ? who immediately went into bankruptcy . Cervantes went to jail again . Here he learned the jargon of thieves , and heard the confessions of murderers . Looking through the bars , he sent his thoughts out over the hot white roads of Andalusia . There he had met the world going by ? strolling players , princes of the Church with rings on their velvet gloves , exiled Moors returned in disguise , venturesome girls iii boys ' clothing , boys from the country running away to town , horse-trading gypsies , hard-drinking muleteers ? all companions of a mile or two on the road , a page or two in the book that was growing in the heart of Cervantes . When released from prison , he was ready for his great life work . And Spain was at last ready to listen . For she , too , had learned . The Armada called " invincible " had sunk to the bottom of the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was destined to save the world her way . Time now to cauterize with the fire of pure laughter the wound in her pride . Time for a fantastic old knight to come riding out of La Mancha 's horizon , behind him his fat servant , Sancho Panza , on a donkey . Out of the shadows around a poor writer of 58 came this immortal pair , and trooping after them hundreds of other characters ? none all good or all bad , but all human . Don Quixote is an old skin-andbones who has read so many novels about the age of chivalry that he has come to believe he is the last knight in Christendom , and must go forth from his village to right wrongs , rescue maidens , slay giants . He sets forth in rusty armor , on a gaunt horse he fondly thinks a fiery charger . To the deluded but valorous Don all he beholds is translated into romance ? a pug-nosed wench is a  | beauteous damsel , a country inn is a castle , a flock of sheep is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , he follows loyally , picking up his master each time he tumbles . When he started this tale , Cervantes meant only to ridicule the foolish chivalric romances that all Spain was reading . But the world is so full of follies that the author soon spurred his knight on . Self-deception , false grandeur , sentimental optimism ? one bubble after another is burst by the lance of laughter . On and on flies the pricking quill , while a household of women clatter and chatter beyond the door . These were his two aging sisters , his faithful niece , his difficult daughter , and Catalina , his wife , loyal to the husband she never understood . Not even they , not even the creditors knocking at the door could distract Cervantes , for his story had run away with him . The Don now begins to command our admiration as well as laughter , and we love him for his crazy nobility of character . Sancho the servant , whom we first assumed to be only a lout , proves to be a fellow worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we discover , two sides of the same person the dreamer and the downto-earth ? and that person is you or I. Don Quixote was first published in 1605 , and its fame sped over the land . The public clamored for more , and Cervantes promised a sequel . Even while he was at work on this , he learned that a sequel to Don Quixote was already on the bookstalls and selling briskly . Its author , who called himself Avellaneda , not only jeered at Cervantes for his poverty but besmeared the stolen characters of the Don and his squire with filthy writing . In a just rage Cervantes drove his pen to finish a true sequel , which turned out to be as good as the first part and better . Today the two parts are printed as one , a volume that stands among the great treasures of Western culture . It has found its way into all the tongues of the civilized world . Many artists , among them Goya , I-Iogarth , Fragonard , Dorc , Dali , have been proud toillust rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into opera and the movies . Not that either fortune or personal fame ever came to Cervantes in his twilight in Madrid . When French diplomats inquired there about the author of Don Quixote , they were told that he was just an old soldier , poor and known to few . They discovered him in a house in the Calle del Leon , where he came to the door on gouty feet to receive his distinguished visitors with old fashioned Castilian courtesy . On April 23 , 1616 , it was death that knocked ; Cervantes was laid in a grave that is now forgotten . Yet forever there rides onward a gallant old man who levels his lance at all that is false , his shadow length ening across Spain , across the world , across the centuries .
