0NE of the country 's smartest and most venerable banks recently sent a question to the chief of its research department . " Arc there any earmarks , " it asked , in effect , " which will tell us whether the management of a corporation is good or bad ? " The research people quickly found that this question is tougher than it looks . Profits alone are not a reliable guide . It is fairly easy for short-sighted executives to show good profits ? for a few years ? by letting their companies ' plant run down , or by gutting reserves of raw material . On the other hand , a firm which has never earned a penny may be just on the doorsill of spectacular success , I:ecause years of developmental work and long-visioned management arc finally ready to pay off . In the end ? after studying hundreds of corporations ? the researchers discovered just one clue . It was totally unexpected ; it apparently is still unknown to the business colleges or professional market analysts ; and it has enabled the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( This , incidentally , is the first time it has ever been made public . ) Here , in effect , is what the research chief reported : " If the top executive in a company gets a salary several times as large as the salaries paid to the Number Two , Three , and Four men , you " can be pretty sure that firm is badly managed . But if the salary levels of the four or five men at the head of the ladder are all close together , then the performance and morale of the entire management group is likely to be high . " The size of the salaries does n't seem to make much difference , " the report continued . " Whether the president of the corporation gets $20,000 a year or $100,000 is n't important ? so long as his vice presidents get something like 75 to 90 per cent as much . But when the president pulls down $100,000 , and his to $25,000 , it is time to look for trouble . " A full explanation for this curious fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office politics , the history of institutions , and the folkways of American industry . It is not the sort of fact which could be uncovered with a comptometer or a time-motion study , or any of the other tools of " scientific management .

WOOD of Sears , Roebuck is now recognized as one of the great practioners of this still-adolescent art ? a sort of Walt Whitman or Frank Lloyd Wright . in his chosen field . Like all such pioneers , he is an exceedingly complex man , who was destined to be widely misunderstood . Also like many geniuses ? Picasso , Lindbergh , Einstein , and Ezra Pound , for example ? he is prone to be wildly erratic when he ventures into the strange terrain of politics . An explanation of his brilliant and bewildering career is offered on page 68 by Irving Pflaurn , foreign editor of the Chicago Sun-Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth noting that Wood 's company followed the Rule of Executive Salaries for a long time before the bank got around to discovering it . Letters Freud Wanted Destroyed IN A poem on the death of Sigmund Freud , in which he tried to sum up what the founder of psychoanalysis meant to the world , W. H. Auden remarked : To us he is no more a person Now but a whole climate of opinion. * Perhaps the most fascinating thing about Freud 's personal letters ( p. 42 ) is the self-portrait which they give of the man before he became a part of the intellectual weather . They show him as a worried Viennese doctor ? hard up for money , bothered by imaginary aches and pains , harassed by family troubles , and often in despair about his work . Like so many of us , Freud found he could n't give up smoking ; and he , too , felt victim to fits of jealousy and to a whole assortment of neuroses . The quirk of fate which kept these letters from being destroyed ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and science ; for they give the best account we have of the way Freud 's mind worked during the years when he was hammering out his revolutionary theories . ? ? ? Adlai E. Stevenson , a former Governor of Illinois*lis now engaged in the private practice of politics in Chicago . In spite of the fact that he is the leader of the Democratic party , his article on page 25 ? the first he has written since his return from a round-the-world trip last spring ? is essentially unpartisan . It is adapted from an address to Lite Association of American Law Schools in December 1953 . ? ? ? Aside from the convicts , guards , and wardens who have ? to live in them , John Bartlow Martin probably knows as much about prisons as any man in America . " Prisons : The Enemy of Society " ( p. 29 ) , like his forthcoming hook , Break Down the Walls , presents Mr. Martin 's expert testimony on the subject of crime , policemen , penitentiaries , and prison riots with which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Martin 's recent books include My Life in Crime ( 1952 ) , an autobiography of a professional thief and gunman , ' for whom Mr. Martin served as a literary collaborator ; Butcher 's Dozen ( 1950 ) , an account of a number of extraordinary murders ; and Why Did They Kill ? ( 1953 ) , a study of juvenile delinquents . Many people are risking their eternal salvation on a " religion " of their own ... which is actually no religion at all . " Oh , I believe in God , " they say , " but I do n't go to church . I 'm just nor the religious type . " Almost everybody , of course , believes that there is a God . Common sense tells us that this is so . But if we actually believe there is a God , should not this same common sense tell us we most do something about it ? And how can we give expression to our belief in God if not through religion ? Religion is simply the consequence of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be honest and consistent with this knowledge ? to learn and fulfill our duties to our Creator . Catholics believe that God created us for a definite purpose ... that He gave us the intelligence to recognize what that purpose is and the means to fulfill it . It is through our religion that we give evidence of our desire to honor and serve God . It is through religion that we approach God in faith , repentance , love and gratitude . If you are living in the belief that you do n't need religion ... that all you have to do is to believe in God and live a moral life ... we urge you to ask yourself these questions ? NOW : " Why am I living ? Why did God create Me ? " The most elementary common sense answer is that you are living because God created you ... and that God has a purpose in doing so . Catholics believe it is our duty to find out what God 's plan is for our lives ? and do our best to live it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... it will pay you to read a specially-prepared pamphlet which we will send you in a plain wrapper , without cost or obligation ... and nobody will call on you .

Also other topics that should concern you deeply . For free copy write today ... Sylvia Wright 's intermittent recipe for chicken liver p ? t ? ( p. 39 ) will he recognized at once both by experts and amateurs in the kitchen as a pioneering article . In support of this claim , Miss Wright argues that the frontier has practically closed on cookbooks : There must by now be books covering every food , even parsnips . With my cooking system , the possible new combinations in recipes are , mathematically , infinite .

If he were only to be remembered as the wartime leader of the 82nd Airborne Division , James M. Gavin would hold a secure place in American military esteem . After the battle of Nijmegen , in September 1944 , Lieutenant General M. C. Dempsey , commanding the British Second Army , greeted him with the remark that he was " proud to meet the commander of the greatest division in the world today . " When such a man is also among the most able writers of current military theory ( see his text on Airborne Warfare , his article in the Combat Forces Journal on " The Tactical Employment of Atomic Weapons , " and another in this issue of Harper 's , on page 54 ) he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's irony ? as the " very model of a modern Major General . " General Gavin enlisted in the Army as a private at the age of seventeen and won an appointment to West Point from the ranks . As a captain , he entered the Parachute School at Fort Benning in October 1941 and two years later jumped into Sicily , four hours before D-Day , as a regimental commander in the first major allied airborne assault . He made three other combat jumps ( Salerno , Normandy , and Holland ) and has received some forty awards and decorations ? including the Purple Heart , the Distinguished Service Cross , and the Croix de Guerre which he discusses in his " How Language Shapes Our Thoughts , " ( p. 76 ) .

Atter commencement he wrote The Butcher , a book about Yerupaja , a mountain in Lima , Peru , where Mr. Sack had worked for UP . He tells us that he also was hired as Santa Claus at R. H.
