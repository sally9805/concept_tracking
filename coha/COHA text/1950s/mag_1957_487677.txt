SPUTNIK 'S EFFECT on the politics and mentality of America will be profound But its impact on the economy will be no less important . As a spokesman for a major aircraft and missile company told me a few days ago , " The boys are going to be jumping all over themselves to see who 'll get in the first bill to increase funds for missiles and manned aircraft after Congress reconvenes . " There were no perceptible tears streaming from his eyes as he spoke . The remark dramatizes the fact that no segment of our economy has more at stake than the aircraft industry in the explosive events triggered by the Sputniks . The industry 's powerful lobby is aware 0 both its responsibilities and its opportunities . Current events are going to shake the industry and force at least a conditional settlement in the sput , tering feud among the nation 's three military services . If the showdown is to be resolved rationally , on the basis of achieving the best defense for the smallest dollar , the military issues must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single military service , no matter how vocal . ? To understand the stake of the aircraft and missile-makers in all this , a few statistics are in order . The industry consists of many companies , but it is substantially dominated by thirteen : Bell , Boeing , Curtiss-Wright , Douglas , General Dynamics ( Convair ) , Grumman , Lockheed , Marti n , McDonnell , North American , Northrop , Republic and United Aircraft . In 1956 , the industry sold $9,496,000,000 worth of goods , an annual turnover exceeded only twice during World War II . in 1943 and 1944 . Over 75 per cent of the total was sold to a single cus- , tomer , the Department of Defense ; and of this , most went to the Air AL TOFFLER , former labor reporter , is a newspaperman specializin ff in the Washington scene . This is the second and concluding , article by Mr. Toffler on the airpower lobby . 428 Force , although some went also to the Army and Navy . ( The Navy 's air arm , incidentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the United States and Soviet air forces are larger . ) As of March , 1957 , six of the above companies ? Grumman , McDonnell , Martin , North AMerican , Northrop and Republic  --  were devoted virtually 100 per cent to filling military orders . The other major firms ranged in degree of dependence on the military from about 60 to 95 per cent . Between October , 1950 , and May , 1957 , the teen companies , in view of their defense nature , received from the government a total of 573 certificates granting rapid amortization privileges on $370,000,000 . The Hebert subcommittee in the House reported in 1956 that twelve of the firms were using $895,000,000 worth of government-owned plants , machine tools and equipment , compared with their own total private investment of $394 ; 000,000 ( a large part of which represented retained profits ) . THE WAR NATURE of the industry was capsuled simply by the Hebert subcommittee : " There is not enough commercial business in this country nor in the world to justify the utilization of all the facilities now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Representative Martha Griffiths ( D.-Mich. ) , a former defense procurement officer in Detroit , referring to the firms which do nothing but military work , told her colleagues : " They  --  the management , and the employees and , to the extent they participate , the stockholders of these companies  --  are just as , much federal employees as you are or as I am . Every dime that they are paid comes from the taxpayers ' money . " In view of this , she said , the government , in determining prices it was ready to pay , ought to scrutinize closely the , profits and remuneration of aircraft companies and their officials . She had in mind that North American , for instance , in 1955 , had paid its president a nice round $147,000 in salary and extras and had paid its chairman $201,000 . The Six companies dependent exclusively , on government contracts paid out $694,000 to their six presidents in 1955 , not including stock options and dividends . The remuneration of their top executives , including presidents and board chairmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion by the thirteen companies whose work is principally for Uncle Sam came to $9,838,000 . Evidently air-industry executives are the highest paid " federal employees " in the history of the nation . i As for profits , in 1956 twelve of the big thirteen made a net , after taxes , of $156,000,000 , according to the Aircraft Industries Association . This was the third best year on record for the industry  --  five times as , much as was made in the Korean War year 1951 and almost twice the net profits of 1952 . Such ' statistics are admittedly slippery ; but these are industry figures , and possibly conservative . Employment in the industry has risen from 237,700 in 1948 to about 900,000 today . This makes the industry the nation 's biggest private employer , with almost 5 per cent of the country 's total manufacturing work force on its payroll . STATISTICS ASIDE , the fact of key ' significance about the aircraft , industry is the intimacy of its relationship with the Air Force , its biggest customer . The two are almOst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on many levels . Company salesmen beat a well-scuffed path to the ' Pentagon . Air-power organizations provide numerous forums for social and business contacts Even more important is the startling osmosis of Air Force brass into the company hierarchies . General Ira C. Eaker , formerly vice-president of the Hughes Tool Co , recently moved over to the Douglas The NATION Aircraft Corp . Convair is headed by General Joseph T. McNarney . Boeing and Convair each at one time reportedly had sixty-seven retired officers on their payrolls . The Martin CO. has had at least fourteen . ( See The Brass-and-Gold Era , by Matthew Josephson , The Nation , January 21 , 1956 . ) The Hebert subcommittee in 1956 charged that " the presence of retired military personnel on payrolls , fresh from the ' opposite side of the desk ' , creates a doubtful atmosphere . " The Congressmen were chiefly concerned with the influence such men could wield on procurement . But there is another , more important and more dangerous , aspect . The purchasing done by the Air Force depends to a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / Theoretically , men in uniform determine basic policy subject to the general approval of civilian authority . But the osmosis process raises the question to what extent Air Force policy is molded by ex-officers whose outlook is colored by interests of the companies they serve . LIBERALS HAVE long felt that the presence of businessmen in key government posts has frequently resulted in harm to the public interest . Right now a House subcommittee , under liberal leadership , is exploring the reverse situation ( a parallel of which exists today in the air raftindustry ) : the employment by industry of former commissioners and other top personnel of the independent regulatory agencies . In many of these agencies , it is possible for a man to leave his job as a commissioner and within twenty-four hours , to appear as counsel before the commission in behalf of a regulated industry . If the influence of industry on government policy in civilian areas is a continuing source of concern , is not the possibility of similar influence on military policy even more alarming ? This is not a charge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor does it impute conscious selfishness or lack of patriotism to the industry and its hired generals . It is , however , a sugDecember 7 , 1957 gestion that the unique relationship between the industry and the Air Force not only makes possible , but actively encourages , the exercise of private influence . What 's more , the stakes are high . THESE , THEN , are the essential characteristics of the aircraft industry : low investment , low working capital , high remuneration for executives , direct dependence on military purchasing , intimacy with a particular branch of the armed forces , dependence on a variety of federal subsidies , absorption of military personnel , interest in strategic policy . Its two major problems are ( 1 ) disarmament and ( 2 ) the rise of the missile . . When Germany first began pouring V-2 rockets upon Britain in World War II , military men were impressed . But they considered the missiles an expensive way to deliver a small warhead . It was n't until the genius of humanity had produced nuclear weapons that it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems as are required by missiles . Ever since , the handwriting has been on the wall for the fliers and manufacturers of manned aircraft . Industry and Air Force spokesmen tend to sneer at Khrushchev 's post-Sputnik description of manned aircraft as museum pieces . They speak in terms of producing at least one more " generation " of long-range , manned bombers . But no one should understand better than they how rapidly aeronautical technology changes . As Look magazine put it not long ago , " The death rattle is in the throat of the flying Air Force . " For the industry , this has posed critical issues  --  and especially for the makers of tactical fighters and bombers , since these appear to be destined for quickest obsolescence . In simple terms , the industry 's problem is how to capture complete , irrevocable and unchallengeable control over missile-making . The proportion of Air Force spending on guided missiles has risen steadily . In fiscal 1951 , it was less than 1 per cent of the total spent for aircraft procurement . By 1952 it rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 per cent . In fiscal 1957 , according to the latest estimates , it was 20.3 per cent and it was expected to be 35 per cent by 1959 , according to a 1956 estimate by the Aircraft Industries Association . With today 's Sputnik furor as a propellant , the missile proportion of total military spending should streak heavenward much faster than expected . The aircraft firms are not merely fighting for contracts to develop , partially produce and assemble missiles ; they are reaching out into related areas . North American , for example , has moved into the manufacture of rocket fuel , and its Rocket-dyne division already accounts for 18 per cent of sales . Another area of interest is the electronics industry , which is responsible for about 50 per cent of the cost of any missile as opposed to 35 per cent of the cost of a plane . The industry , accordingly , has prospered on subcontracted work from the aircraft industry , and as the president of the **28;1661;TOOLONG Manufacturers Association said last spring , " The ceiling is not in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching into electronics . THE aircraft industry is in transition , and Wall Street analysts , ever sensitive to shifting industrial patterns , expect a " shakeout . " The number of firms will be smaller , and those which remain will be bigger . Last year a quarter-million workers for small , scattered subcontractors produced nearly a billion dollars worth of goods and services for planes and missile-makers . According to the Wall Street Journal , these " Corporate satellites " are already being squeezed 429 as the giant aircraft firms go increasingly into the " parts " business . And the squeeze will tighten in the months ahead . In the race for missile work the aircraft manufacturers see no major competition from any other industry . Even the electronics industry hardly falls into the competitive category ; as long as the aircraft makers remain the prime contractors , they can control the degree of subcontracting . What the , industry fears is competition from the government as represented by the tendency of the Army and the Navy Bureau of Ordnance ( but not the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to assign projects to government-operated arsenals using government employees . It was industry disapproval of this trend that lay behind the furious battle over the Air Force 's Thor missile as against the Army 's Jupiter . This , in turn , formed the backdrop of the court-martial of Army Colonel John Nickerson . Jupiter was developed by the Army at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville , Alabama . Component parts were made by aircraft companies , but if the missile ever goes into production , it will be built not by an aircraft company but by Chrysler . Meanwhile , the normally highly lucrative de-velopment work and the overall supervision were performed by government employees rather than privately-employed workers . In contrast , the comparable Thor is being developed for the Air Force by Douglas Aircraft . IT WAS NOT surprising , therefore , that a fever-pitch propaganda battle developed over the two missiles . Air Force supporters opened a cam- .. paign to discredit Dr. Wernher von Braun , the Army 's German missile expert . Aviation , Week , one of the industry 's chief publications , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Air Force . At the same time , General Orval Cook , head of the Aircraft Industries Association , insisted that the " government arsenal has outlived its usefulness . " Moreover , Cook told newsmen , the universities should stick to teaching and basic research , leaving development work for industry . Advocates of the arsenal , however , point out that research and development are the fuzziest of all cost items . By doing some of both at arsenals , it is possible for the government to gain some notion of the real cost factors involved . In effect , the arsenal can function as a yardstick . The controversy also revealed the increasing importance of research and development from a financial point of view . The industry is not kicking up a squall about peanuts ; big money is involved .. It is estimated that the Department of Defense this year will spend over five billion dollars for research and development . However , only about 40 per cent of this sum is directly appropriated ; the rest of the amount is scattered through other budgetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pin down . Even the A.I.A. is n't sure of the size of the nugget involved . The organization is making conditional use of a partial breakdown issued last September by the National Science Foundation , which shows that of the identifiable $2,000,000,000 which the Defense Department will obligate for research and development in fiscal 1958 , nearly $1.3 billion will be spent on projects handled intramurally or by non-profit agencies . This is a rise of almost $400,000 , - 000 since 1955 in expenditures with- : held from private enterprise . The A.I.A. believes that there are additional millions hidden away in less identifiable appropriations . In all , the A.I.A. scents a minimum of around a billion dollars which could be smoked out by its members if the Army and the Navy were as cooperative as the Air Force . A DECADE of intimate association with an " understanding " Air Force has given the aircraft industry a stake in the outcome of the continuing inter-service warfare . Congressman George Mahon ( D.-Tex. ) - set this rivalry in its proper perspective last spring when he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careers to one of the three services . ' Will they have a place in the sun in the 1960s or will their careers go into decline ? The present assumption is that any service which fails to have a part in the utilization of intermediate range and intercontinental ballistic missiles will be relegated to a lesser role . . . . The stakes are high . . . . The desperate struggle for power and position among the services is quite understandable , and real , and quite expensive and ' wasteful . The conflict among the services revolves around this hard core of truth . But it is clothed in all kinds of strategic rationales . Thus the Air Force has taken the position that the nation can not afford continued maintenance of strong " conventional forces " ( read Army ) . General Twining has told the Senate that the country can not have military forces for both " the old type of warfare plus those for atomic warfare . ? . and our mind is made Certainly his mind is made up  --  and made up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all this a relentless diminution of its role , prestige and budget , counters with the sophisticated argument that reduction in conventional forces raises the " level of provocation " necessary before this country would respond militarily to defend its interests . We must , argue the Army theorists , be prepared to dole out retaliation in measured , and not merely in massive , doses . THERE ARE many other points of conflict between the Air Force and its one-time parent , the Army . On a military-technical level , they focus on what kind of missiles the Army will be permitted to develop and use . Essentially , the Air Force argues that missiles are air weapons . They fly , do n't they ? The Army counters by noting that they are basically an extension of artillery , a traditional Army function . Meanwhile , the Navy has its own air and seapower interests , which it is jealously guarding . These may sound like questions which the generals and admirals ought to settle by themselves . However , they are questions which citizens in a democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . The weapons involved are too big and too dangerous . The stakes affect everyone  --  including the aircraft industry . Any shift of " roles and missions " which gave the Army primary responsibility for missile warfare would make the Army , rather than the Air Force , the Number One customer of the aircraft industry . This would shatter all the business , personal , social , political and economic relationships which have grown up between the Air Force and the dozen or so key aircraft companies . From the industry 's viewpoint , it would mean dealing with a service which has shown much less readiness to " cooperate . " And it would render obsolete the services of all the Air Force officers recruited by the industry to do its bargaining . IN SHORT , if the Air Force fails to come out on top in the inter-service , Armageddon which is in the offing , the results could be very serious for the aircraft makers . So once , again the industry finds it necessary to support the particular strategic reasoning of a single branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refine , stiffen or otherwise influence it . Thoughtful aircraft men must recognize the dangers that grow out of this kind of relationship . The perils should be even more clear to outsiders . And as for remedies , perhaps the only real one is relaxation of world tensions and the planned replacement of arms production by something more constructive . Short of this , however , Congress and the people ought to give thought to the implications of the fact that the nation 's biggest manufacturing industry is now a kind of mutant in our capitalist society , dependent almost solely on public funds for its day-to-day existence . To provoke this thoughtful concern has been the purpope of these articles .
