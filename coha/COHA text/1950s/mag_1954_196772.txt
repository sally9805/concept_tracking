For most patients , the old-fashioned basal metabolism test is a mild form of torture , but that would be no reason for discarding it if it were a consistently accurate test . The fact is that it is far from reliable , and four Navy researchers have come to the conclusion that in big medical centers with facilities for handling radioisotopes. it should be replaced by the " atomic cocktail . " <P> Since the thyroid is the key organ in metabolism , and since radioactive iodine-131 makes a beeline for the thyroid , a simple check with a scintillation counter held against the throat can show when it is overactive : an overactive thyroid removes more iodine-131 from the blood than a normal one , and this shows in a higher reading on the dial of the counter . Moreover , where the atomic cocktail test was once thought to require a second visit to the laboratory for a reading 24 hours afterward , researchers at the Navy 's Radioisotope Laboratory in Bethesda , Md. now find that all the patient need do is swallow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sit around for an hour until the technician comes with the scintillation counter .
