The operation for cataracts was successful , but the 70-year-old man in the charity ward at Manhattan 's New York Eye &; Ear Infirmary still could not see without expensive glasses . Then a hospital worker sat down and wrote a postcard . Last week a pair of thick new glasses arrived and for the first time in twelve years he was able to read . A Christmas card with the glasses bore the name : " New Eyes for the Needy-Short Hills , N.J. " <P> In the Depression ' 30s , a Red Cross worker from Short Hills named Mrs. Arthur E. Terry watched relief applicants fumbling and groping , but too poor to buy glasses . She began salvaging the metal from old glasses , jewelry , fillings and dental plates , had it melted down , and used the money to buy glasses for anyone who could not afford his own . It took about 20 old pairs ( nowadays it takes 40 pairs ) to pay for a new one . Mrs. Terry got out and stumped church , civic and club groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Alexander Woollcott , to put her on his radio show . <P> Soon , boxes of old glasses were arriving at the Short Hills post office , sometimes as much as 200 Ibs. of them in a week . A woman in Ohio left a note willing her glasses to the " spectacle lady " when she died ; a small girl mailed her glasses to the " poor eyes lady , " sent along seven pennies for good measure . <P> As fast as the glasses came in , Mrs. Terry and her helpers sent out vouchers for new ones . New Eyes asked the National Society for the Prevention of Blindness for the names of people who needed help . Glasses were shipped to every state in the U.S. An eight-year-old boy who had lost one eye pleaded for a glass one . It took 150 pairs of old spectacles to raise the money , but he got his new eye for Christmas . In 18 years , New Eyes has collected 400,000 pairs of old glasses , sent out money for 65,000 new pairs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man : " It 's like coming out of a dark cellar . I do n't have to stumble any more . "
