( See Cover ) <P> California 's Attorney General " Pat " Brown marched across the lobby of San Diego 's U.S. Grant Hotel , his stocky body ( 5 ft. 10 in. , 200 Ibs. ) rolling like a sea captain 's , his brown hair carefully slicked with Vaseline Hair Tonic , his ample jowl set with fierce , self-conscious determination . Suddenly he stopped , whirled , brought the men behind him to a skidding halt . " Where is everybody ? " cried Pat Brown . " Anybody missing ? Are we ready to go ? " An aide soothed him : " Do n't worry , Pat . Everybody 's here . " Brown looked carefully around just to make sure . " Well , " he explained , " I want to get out there while people are still going to work . " He spun , led the way out the door , clambered into a Plymouth station wagon . Edmund Gerald Brown , 53 , Democratic candidate for Governor of California , odds-on favorite in what may be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to a 6:15 a.m. appointment with destiny . He did not intend to be late . <P> Destiny was waiting last week on the San Diego waterfront , where Pat Brown " officially " opened his campaign against William Fife Knowland , 50 , retired as Republican leader of the U.S. Senate to run for Governor in California . <P> Point of Departure . Arriving on the waterfront , Brown jumped from his car , plunged through the low-hanging fog to the point where hundreds of workmen were converging on the Star &; Crescent ferry slip , ready to ride to their Navy shipyard jobs on North Island . " I 'm Pat Brown ! " cried Candidate Brown , reaching for workmen 's hands as if they were gold nuggets . One , two , three workmen hurried past , heads down , clutching their lunch boxes , leaving Pat 's hand dangling in midair . A ferry attendant came up , told <P> Brown he was blocking the entrance , ordered him to one side . Brown stepped away , looked suspiciously at several pigeons flapping close overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit . Thirty paces in front , his aides worked at their cheerleading tasks . " Shake hands with Pat Brown , " they shouted , " your candidate for Governor . " <P> Somehow the incantation began to work . " Hi , Pat , " came a workman 's voice . Hands reached out to grasp Pat 's . " Morning , Patrick , " came a greeting . Then another and another : " Good luck , Pat " and " Give ' em hell , Pat . " Pat Brown grinned happily , pumped hands with a proficiency that would make Estes Kefauver seem like a subway straphanger . " Hey , " he cried to no one in particular . " I feel a speech coming on . " Candidate Brown was in his element , doing what he knows and likes best . He was being just plain Pat , making himself liked-and running well ahead of the opposition .
