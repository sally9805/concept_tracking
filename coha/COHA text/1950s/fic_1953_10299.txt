a boil lc of wine , and the waiter brings you the latest edition of the ' Tagliche , and you sit and eat in leisurely fashion , and read and take a sip now and then , and read some more . Lanny read , but only a line or two at a time , and then he would look up to sec who was coming in . It was a long wait , an hour or so . He made it all right by calling for another paper and giving the waiter a tip . Then at last his heart gave a jump : there was Kurt Meissner coming in at the door , and alone ; Kurt Meissner , tall , long-faced , and grave , dressed in a suit well worn and unpressed  --  the fashion among all Germans , and especially among East Germans . Lanny got up and went toward him with eagerness he did n't have to feign . " Kurt ! What a piece of luck ! What are you doing in Berlin ? Come , sit with me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and the request was hard to refuse . Kurt manifested no haste , but he came . Lanny 's manner was full of happiness ; Kurt 's manner was dour . The waiter came with the menu , and Kurt ordered ravioli . Lanny realized that he would have to take something which could be eaten with a fork alone ; doubtless at home the faithful Elsa cut up his meat for him . No comment was to be made about that . When the waiter had departed Lanny said , " I 'm so glad to have run into you , Kurt . I thought I was never going to see you again . Tell me , what are you doing in Berlin ? " " I am here on business connected with my music . " " Are they going to publish you , Kurt ? " " I 'm not sure . " Evidently he was not going to be seduced , not even by the most seductive of topics . But Lanny 's program was to attack and keep on attacking . " I think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friendship could be re-sumed . I wish so that I could help you . " " I have told you that I am not in need of help . " " 1 know , but I can not believe it , Kurt . How are you able to live ? How are you going to get along in the present situation here ? " " This is not the place to discuss it , Lanny . " " I will lower my voice ; no one will hear us . If you see anyone standingbehind me you can cough , and I will stop . I will tell you somethingthat has just come to my knowledge . You have heard , I suppose , of the Katyn forest and what happened there ? " " I have heard the story . " " I wo n't name any names . You know who was blamed for it , and you know that they had nothing to do with it . You know who actuallyp201did that most hideous action . There must be other mass graves which have never been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the face of the earth ; they were put under the earth . And that ought to show you the kind of people you are dealing with . " " I do not need anybody to point that out to me . " " You know the pretenses they make . They believe in art and culture ; they are going to raise civilization to a higher level ; but what they do is force everybody into one mold , their mold . It is the end of all freedom , all initiative  --  and how can art or culture thrive under such circumstances ? You have been a free man , you have written what you believed , and you can not possibly write what you pretend to be-lieve . " " You can not know what I believe . " " I know your inmost being , and I have the firm conviction that it can not change . I am speaking to the man I used to know so well and for so many years .

If you are trying to repress that inner being of yours , you may succeed for a time but not forever . I am appealing to that being in the hope of bringing him back to life . " But Kurt 's grim look did not change . " You are being eloquent , " he said , " but you are mistaken . I know what I am and I know what I am doing . " " You are deceiving yourself . You are telling yourself that you can deal with these new people , that you can pretend to agree with them and fool them . You believe that you can live a life that you hate , but you can not ; it will wither up your creative powers . The means will become the end , and you will be deceiving yourself instead of others .

But you must understand , families here are not let alone to grow up by accident . Children are taken from their parents and are disciplined and propagandized . They sing songs  --  you know the kind , I do n't have to describe them to you . They will come home singing them to you , and how will you like it ? They will be taught that their first duty in life is to spy upon you . You may think that you can train them to hate the enemy , but surely you will find out that little minds , which are spontaneous and impulsive , can not be made into mature intriguers.  |p202They  will inevitably let out some secret , and that will be the end of you. , , Kurt coughed , and Lanny fell silent . The waiter brought the food and put it on the table . He withdrew , but not very far , and obviously was remaining for the purpose of spying  --  a common purpose at that time . So Lanny inquired whether Kurt knew anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the waiter had to go to another table . Then he resumed , " I am pleading with you on behalf of the Western world ; it needs your genius and should have it . You are a man of the West , all your thought is of the West . How could Goethe , how could Beethoven , have lived in this world where you are now ? Did anyone ever tell those men what to write or how to write it ? You know , and I know , that German culture is based upon freedom . German science is based upon the right to speculate and teach  --  even the most reactionary rulers of German states never dared to interfere with academic freedom . But how is it here ? I do n't have to go into details , you know it as well as I do . What these people want from German science is only rockets , jet planes , and atomic bombs  --  that sort of progress . What they want is to get the Ruhr and turn it to the manufacture of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Britain at their mercy . And what will the Germans be then ? Slaves and robots ! " " This is no place for such a discussion , " protested Kurt again , and more sharply . " I am talking low , and no one can hear us . I am pleading with you to let me help you find a way to get into the Western world . I will take care of you and your family financially until you get on your feet . My father would be delighted to do it if I asked him . I will stand sponsorfor you ; I will certify that you are not engaged in any political activities . You can become a great artist once more , and not a puppet artist like Shostakovich . " " I have told you that I am not interested in all this  --  " " I 'm trying to save you from certain doom .

And youp203may be certain they are keeping watch upon you now . I do n't know who your friends are , but you can be sure that one of them is a spy . Ask yourself , Which one , man or woman , and what is he informing about you and putting on the record ? When the time comes you will he hauled up for questioning ; you will be taken to the torture chamber ; you will be told what to confess , and you will confess it : any mon-strous crimes they have thought up , and you will accuse anybody they want to get rid of . Your children will be sent to a state farm , your wife will go to work in a coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber or stood up against the wall and riddled with bullets . " " Hush ! " whispered Kurt . The waiter had come back to his station , and Kurt raised his finger and beckoned . The man came . " My check , " said the guest . " Is there anything wrong with the food , sir ? " inquired the waiter , looking at the plate which had barely been touched . " Nothing is wrong with the food . I do not feel well . The check , please . " He took the check , looked at it , and counted out a number ofmarks , enough to include a tip . He rose and without a word more stalked out of the restaurant . Lanny went back and reported to Monck , " I 'm pretty sure I scared him , but what will come of it remains to be seen . " Monck , in turn , told him that he had had a talk with the girl , and she was ready for anything . She had gone to the Soviet military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her family in Wendefurth . So Lanny went back to work at RIAS ; and three or four days later Monck called him on the AMG phone . " She 's gone in , " Monck said , using no names ; and that was all . He had told Lanny that they would have a code for communicating . She would write letters , innocent in appearance . On the other hand , they might never hear from her again . It was like seeing somebody jump into the crater of a volcano . Berlin was a great city caught in a fantastic plight . It was half in ruins , especially the important , the " downtown , " sections , in which business and industry were housed . More than three million people still lived in its 340 square miles , and they had to have food every day and work when possible . They lived as best they could in the ruins , and hundreds of new people came daily to join them in their discomfort . The new arrivals came from countries to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could carry on their backsp204or their heads . The boundaries of the metropolis measured 144 miles , and all the surrounding territory was Russian . There was no way to keep people from sneaking in , and to send them back to the Reds meant death or imprisonment worse than death . Some could be sent into West Germany , but they would have to pass through Soviet-held territory , so only as many could be sent as could be flown . They were much less than welcome in West Germany , which already had seven million refugees to take care of . So the American Army was kept busy building barracks , and American ships were busy bringing food from home  --  such were the penalties a civilized country paid for having won a war . The four sectors of the city were ruled by four different armies . They were supposed to have one civilian government , elected by the population . This population was Socialist and had elected a SocialDemocraticmayor , Ernst Reuter ; but the four military administrations had squabbled over him  --  the Reds would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had compromised upon his deputy , and so the once-proud capital of imperial Germany had a woman mayor , Luise Schroder . The city had been not merely the political but the intellectual and cultural capital of Germany . The Soviets fully intended to take possessionof it all ; they saw themselves as a Red wave rolling over that populous and important island . They had planned it from a long way back , and an essential part of the plan was to take possession of the minds of the population . When their troops had swept into the city one of the places they had seized was the splendid , undamaged building of Radio Berlin . Thus they came into possession of a great library of books , files of clippings , and a stock of recorded music ; also a highly trained staff who knew Germany and the Germans and could be kept at work and told what to do . When the division of the city was agreed upon , this radio stationwas in the British sector , but the Russians held on to it , refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on to it even after they had put other stations on the air at Potsdam , Leipzig , and Dresden . The Americans had been slow to realize that they had a new war on their hands , a propaganda war . They had set up a little radio enterprise , using a German device by which you plugged in on your telephone line and got programs . In the badly damaged telephone exchange they had set up their RIAS , operated by amateurs , anti-Nazis who had been barred from the German radio for a dozen years . They had only threep205studios , too small for either an orchestra or an audience ; but they had given the facts about what was happening in the outside world , and gradually the Germans had found it out and got into the habit of listening . General Clay , scrupulously courteous to his Soviet allies , had forbidden any American publicity under his control to argue with them or to say anything impolite about them . For almost two years the American radio had endured incessant Soviet attacks without makingany reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by day . The staff chafed under the restriction , but it was a military order and had to be obeyed . The tone of RIAS was what the Germans called menschlich , that is , human ; it favored no race , no creed , no party ; its music was listened to by all the various kinds of people in Berlin . Russian soldiers were forbidden to listen to it , but even the officers broke that rule . They heard Russian music , including some which had been banned by their government because of its sentimental and unmilitary tone . RIAS made friends , and its reputation spread  --  it spread even to Washington , D. C. , to the great marble building on the hill where penurious congressmen were persuaded under heavy pressure to give it a little more money . In the days of the military rush through Germany , Lanny had met a Russian-speaking sergeant in the American Army who had been interrogatingRussian prisoners in the same way that Lanny had been interrogatingGerman prisoners . Boris Shub was his name , and now he showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Military Government in Berlin . He remembered meeting Lanny , and they enjoyed exchanging reminiscences of those days of glory . Shub had been at the little Prussian town of Kloetze near the River Elbe when the American and the Soviet armies had met and stood at salute while the bands played " The Star-Spangled Banner " and the " Internationale . " He had seen the spontaneous friendliness of the two armies , the eager curiosity of the Russians about everything their American Allies had . Even though they could not talk they could smile , and learn the names for things , and swap souvenirs . On Sunday there had been a formal ceremony at the square ; the Red Cross girls had served coffee and doughnuts , and the bands had played a truly international program of music : " Dixie " and " Yankee Doodle , " the Red Army song called " Meadowland " and even the German Army song " Lill Marlene , " which had been , as Shub phrased it " on the international hit parade of Worldkp206War II . " Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing " Tipperary "  --  translated , of course , and it sounded odd with Russian words . Shub told of the new attitude which the Soviets had revealed . The first signs had been the treatment accorded to the Russian prisoners who had been captured by the Germans in the early days of the war . In the first tremendous sweep of the mechanized Wehrmacht great numbers of Russian troops had been surrounded ; some had surrendered because they did not want to fight , but greater numbers had fought gallantly and had given up only when their ammunition was exhausted . They had been liberated by the American Army and came pouring toward the Elbe . There were three hundred Russian officers who had been in an internment camp . They wanted to rejoin their own army ; they waited for permission , but no permission came , and the Soviet officer in commandrefused to visit them or pay any attention to them . The civilian refugees whom the Germans had put at forced labor wanted to go back to their homeland but were afraid . They inquired anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . The Americans inquired of the Soviet authorities and were told that everything would be all right and the refugees would be well treated . So they went , and they were dreadfully treated . Some escaped and fled back to the American zone , where Shub met them and heard their stories . In the four months immediately following V-E Day more than five million Russians were repatriated from the Axis lands . Many had to walk hundreds of miles under the guard of soldiers with tommyguns . They were packed into freight cars like cattle and nailed up for the journey . The officers were stripped of their insignia and many of their uniforms . They were forced to answer questionnaires containing a hundred and fifty-three questions about every aspect of their lives . Some were taken away and never heard of again . A greater number were housed in the concentration camps where formerly the German prisoners had been kept ; the camps were unspeakablyfilthy and dilapidated , and semistarvation and disease were rife . Ultimately these prisoners were distributed to slave labor in mines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence was from three to five years at hard labor , and every prisoner was required to sign an agreement that he would never reveal what had happened to him or her . Some who escaped showed up in Berlin , in Paris , and other places where Shub interviewed them . From his notebook he gave Lannyp207stories of half-a-dozen typical cases  --  and these were brought back in due course to Edgemere , New Jersey . There was the testimony of a Russian soldier who prior to his plight had served as chauffeur to a Soviet major-general named Grachev ; he had driven the general from Dresden to Moscow , and on arriving in Moscow on the twenty-seventh of April I946 he had witnessed the following scene : " Near the All-Union Agricultural Exhibit a column of women moved toward us , the flank guarded by soldiers armed with rifles . When we drove alongside the column my heart sank . The women wore skirts made of sacks , canvas blouses , and wooden shoes . Their hair was covered with gray rags . That 's the way all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed . " Who are they ? ' I asked . " Traitors to the Motherland , ' I was told . Repatriates . There are lots of them here . They are doing reconstruction work  --  building . ' " Lanny had been able to listen to the Peace Program on a short-wave set in the RIAS office . He made it a rule to telephone Laurel once a week and learned that all was going well . That new miracle of nature which he had helped to achieve was thriving perfectly ; she was actuallytwo weeks ahead of Dr. Gesell 's schedule  --  that professor at Yale University who had devoted many years of study to the progress of the normal human infant and could tell you at what week the creature should roll over , at what week it should begin to crawl , and so on . Lanny felt a strong pull in the direction of home . He told the RIAS people he had given them all the advice he had in him . He would go back to Edgemere and tell the people of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of the " cold war . " He would visit Washington and do what he could to stir up the officials in the State Department so that RIAS could have permission to answer directly the day-and-night attacks which Radio Berlin was making upon it . Theoretically , to turn the other cheek to the blows of an assailant was an ethical action , but there ought to be a time limit on such a procedure , and two years seemed enough . Lanny did n't visit the Riviera this time . He had a telephone chat with Beauty and learned that all was well there . Happy was the family whose annals were brief . He was flown to the London airport in a British plane and stayed over a day in order to have a good evening with Alfy Pomeroy-Nielson . Russians and Germans were important ,  |p208but  British were important too ; they were making one of the great social advances in the world 's history . They were proving that Marx had been right and that Lenin had been wrong : the Anglo-Saxon peoples could achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow of government . " The inevitability of gradualness " had been one of the slogans of the Fabians , and now in their plodding , undramatic way the British people were making over their world . Immediately after the war the Labour party had put forward a program : . the socialization of five basic industries  --  coal , electricity , transportation , steel , and the Bank of England . They promised socialized medicine , so that no sick person in Britain need go unattended , and they promised to regulate the prices of food so that no person in Britainneed go hungry . They had printed that program in pamphlet form and seen to its public distribution , and they had swept the elections on that basis . Now they were proceeding to carry out their promises , strictly and precisely , one by one . Alfy , as a newly elected Labour member and son of an old-time supporter of the party , was in the midst of these exciting events , and he told about them with un-British enthusiasm . In less than two years more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest was going to be carried out to the dotting of the last i and the crossing of the last t , and in spite of all the clamor of Tory opposition . Said the onetime RAF officer , " It 's the first time that this has ever been done in history  --  I mean , that a political party has kept all its promises to the electorate . Do you know of any other case , Lanny ? " Lanny thought and said , " The Bolsheviks would claim that they kept Lenin 's promises , but they did n't . Lenin promised that the state would wither away , but you see it growing like Jonah 's gourd . " " And besides , they killed millions of people , " said the other . " We have n't killed a single one  --  unless some Tory peer has died of indig-nation . " The British government was a unit ; the prime minister was under the control of Parliament . But the United States appeared to have a government at war with itself , and Alfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , in which the President was a Democratand the Congress Republican ; and even if the Democratic party carried Congress , the President would still have his hands tied , because the Southern legislators who called themselves Democrats usually voted Republican . The South was a generation behind the rest of the country in its economic development , and therefore in its economic philosophy . Its politicians called themselves Democrats because thep209209Republican party had fought and won the Civil War ; but when it came to questions of finance and business they were in the age of Harding and Coolidge , or even of McKinley . Lanny had a chance to find out what the Tory peers thought about all this . It was his social duty to report to Irma on the welfare of their newly wed daughter . When he called Wickthorpe castle he learned that the couple were in town . Cedric Masterson , Earl of Wickthorpe , took seriously his legislative duties , even though what he said and how he voted no longer made much difference . When Lanny called the town house Irma said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Lanny ? " And he replied , " Okay . " There were husbands who would feel a certain embarrassment at meeting the former husband of a wife , but in such matters Ceddy prided himself upon being what he called " mod'n , " and Irma was " mod'n " also , even to the pronunciation of a language which had changed in the course of its journey from London to Chicago . So Lanny went to the stately town house and had a meal served bya stately butler and a footman whom he knew well and greeted as old friends , for Lanny and Irma had been tenants and intimates of Ceddy for some time before the marital shift had taken place . He had nothing but pleasant news to report about Frances , a blissfully happy bride and busy idealist , certain that she was helping to prevent the next war . His lordship remarked that she would do better working in a munitionsfactory ; he was convinced that the Bolsheviks meant world con-questand would settle for nothing less . So they talked about politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow-wows , and how America was going to have to carry the whole world on its shoulders , financially speaking , and would the American people stand for that ? Britain was being taxed until it was just about ready for the poorhouse . Lanny had known the Earl of Wickthorpe since his blooming , pinkcheekedyouth . Now he was middle-aged and his fair hair was getting thin on top , but he was still a vigorous Englishman who walked all over his estate every day when he was at home . His conversation , however , was extremely depressing . " It 's what you asked for , Lanny , and I hope you like it , " he said . " I belong with the dinosaurs and the dodos , and I 'm getting ready to pack up and join them . If it was n't for Irma 's money I would have been taking in boarders long ago . "  |p210Lanny  had a hard time to keep from grinning over the idea of the Earl of Wickthorpe taking in boarders ; but he knew it was no joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a bus line and doing his own driving , and that another with his wife was selling fish . Irma 's income came from street railroads in the American Middle West , and she was supposed to pay about eighty-five per cent of it in the form of income tax to the Washington government . She had resorted to the device which had become so popular among Americans of her class : the setting up of a foundation which would be tax free and would spend her money for purposes that could be made to wear a humanitarianaspect . She had two secretaries working at the castle , classifying and editing the papers of her father , the late J. Paramount Barnes , the traction magnate . They were going to compile a life of this historic character , and it was n't necessary that the book should be good or that anybody should read it when it was published . Lanny did n't have to ask tactless questions in order to understand that these secretaries were running errands for the countess , doing her shopping , attending to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lanny could guess that the tutors of the two sons of Ceddy and Irma might likewise be considered as performing humanitarian services ; even the gardeners were keeping up the grounds on which the J. ParamountBarnes Foundation was lodged . There was no law to prevent a foundation spending its money abroad , where the United States InternalRevenue Service might have difficulty in checking up on it . Ceddy had some eight hundred peers in Britain , but not all of them took their duties seriously  --  which was just as well , since the chamber set apart for their use could not have accommodated a third of them . Ceddy would write a speech , study it , revise it a dozen times with painful care , and then deliver it and release it to the newspapers ; but , paper being scarce , they would print only a paragraph or two . Ceddy , however , had plenty of paper , because Irma 's foundation paid for it , and also for printing . He had accumulated lists of names of important persons all over the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain was being led to certain bankruptcy by men who thought of nothing but garnering votes from the discontented classes . To handle all this he had an office on his estate with a manager and a secretary , and Irma 's foundation paid for all of it.  |p211In  the dear dead days beyond recall Lanny Budd 's marriage had been broken up because Irma had become an admirer of Adolf Hitler , taking him for a man who believed in order and the rights of private property , especially in large quantities . To be sure , he had called himself a Socialist  --  a National Socialist  --  but he had been like those Southern senators who called themselves Democrats and voted Republican . So all through the late war Irma and her new husband had been pacifists ; they had been perfectly willing for Hitler to take Europe and advocatedaccepting his promise to respect the British Empire and let it alone . But now the world kaleidoscope had been shaken again , and Irma and Ceddy were declining to trust " Soso " Stalin and any of his promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat to his embarrassment , found himself in political agreement with them . In the mail forwarded from Edgemere had been some of the customary letters rebuking him for the stand he had taken on the Peace Program . One of these was from a grower of avocados and winter vegetables in a place called Pahokee , Florida ; it consisted of a list of names : " MacArthur  --  Chiang-kaiShek  --  the French in Indo-China  --  the Dutch in Java  --  the oil men in Persia and Arabia  --  the Turks  --  the Greek Nazis  --  de Gaulle  --  the Pope  --  Franco  --  Salazar  --  Lanny Budd ! " Yes , that was the company he was keeping ; and now the Earl and Countess of Wickthorpe ! Lanny , of course , might have compiled another list , beginning with Stalin and including all the various torturers whom Stalin had put to work : Dzerjinsky , Yagoda , Yezhov , the various chiefs of the Gaypayoo and the Cheka and the NKVD and the MVD ; the killers of the Katyn forest and the Red Army chiefs who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of Jews and a hundred thousandPoles ; the men who were holding ten or twenty million prisoners in concentration camps , the map of which made northern Russia and Siberia look like a sprinkling from a pepper box ! Oh yes , it would be easy to say , " You too ! " and go on making faces and calling names over the back fence of the world . What was a man to do who desired that the power of America be used to bring freedom and order to the tormented human race ? Was he to say , " A plague on both your houses , " and retire to Pahokee , Florida , to grow avocados and winter vegetables ? Should he go and join the lotos-eaters of Tennyson ? In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclinedOn the hills like Gods together , careless of mankind ... .  |p212Where  they smile in secret , looking over wasted lands , Blight and famine , plague and earthquake , roaring deeps and fiery sands , Clanging fights , and flaming towns , and sinking ships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music centred in a doleful songSteaming up , a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong . Lanny was flown the familiar route by way of Iceland and Newfoundland . From Gander Airport he was flown in an Army plane directly to Washington , and in the seat beside him was an assimilated lieutenant colonel , coming home on leave . David Krichevsky was an electrical technician attached to the Signal Corps , and as he had been born in Russia and spoke Russian he was one of a large group assigned to restore and service two cables which ran between Berlin and the American zone of Germany . This was through Soviet territory , so Krichevsky had a day-by-day view of that " cold war " which the Reds were waging against their recent allies . They wanted to drive the Americans out and shut off those communications , and they were resorting to a system of persecutions , sometimes going as far as kidnapingand murder . There were seven " repeater " stations strung out along the line of those cables , and at each of these the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Americans lived in the upper story of the house and the Russians lived underneath  --  signal men and MVD agents , the Russian Secret Police . They watched every move the Americans made , and they invaded the American quarters for inspection at any hour of the day or night . They even objected to the bathroom being locked , and when the Americans put on locks the Russians broke them . The house had a fence around it enclosing a yard less than fifteen feet square , and the Americans were not allowed outside the yard unless accompanied by a Soviet guard . If something went wrong with the cable and a man rushed out to fix it in a hurry , that man would be arrested and spirited away , and then an American officer would go to the Soviet authorities to demand his return and they would profess to know nothing about him , even though he was in the same building at the time . On more than one occasion the Americans had found meansp213to spirit the man away ; on other occasions the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are never going to rest , Mr. Budd , until they 've shut off those cables . In fact I do n't think they 'll rest until they have driven us out of Berlin . " " I doubt if they will go that far , " replied Lanny . But the other wanted to know , What would we do if they were to shut off the roads as well as the cables ? " Do we have the right of access to Berlin in the agreements we made with them ? " Lanny did n't know about that . He said , " We have a law that the ownership of land carries with it the right of access to it . But of course the Reds may say they have different laws from what we have . Anyhow , I do n't think we 'll let ourselves be driven out without a fight , and I 'm sure we wo n't let our people be starved there . " Lanny paid a visit to the Treasury Building , where Turner of the Secret Service gathered several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had observed of the doings of Germans and Russians , and his impressions of Monck and Morrison and the others with whom he had been working . When this session was over Turner remarked , " If you have an hour or two to spare I will show you something interesting . " Lanny said his time was his own , and the official took him into a separate room where there were a number of small tables , each with a chair , in front of a curious-looking apparatus . It had the appearance of a metal hood with a large opening in the front . A bright light was switched on at the top , and it shone down through a couple of glass plates and onto the sloping floor of the hood . It was an apparatus for the comfortable reading of microfilm . Turner took from his pocket an envelope containing several thin strips of celluloid . There were tiny photographs on the strips , each about the size of a postage stamp ; when a strip was slipped on rollers between the glass plates a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood , and there was a page , bright and clear for reading , the size of a book with large type . You could sit comfortably and read the page , and when you had finished you pushed the little celluloid strip an inch or less to the right and there was page two , and so on . The strips were labeled " Himmler money  --  Sachsenhausen . " Turnerp214explained that it was a confidential report by Scotland Yard , giving the results of a study of material in the records of the Nazi SD , the secret police of the Hitler regime ; also from interviewing prisoners of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp who had worked in the enterprise of manufacturing British money . The report filled some thirty pages , and it took Lanny a couple of hours to read it carefully and make notes . A story the like of which had never been in the world before , and might never be again  --  unless it should happen that the records of the Soviet secret services should be opened to inspection in the same way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched for expert engravers , printers , and technicians of every sort having to do with the manufacture of paper money . Only Jews had been chosen , the evident intention being to exterminate them when the job was done and thus to bury forever the truth about the enterprise . These unfortunate experts were not invited , nor were they hired at high salaries ; they were arrested and sentenced to the Sachsenhausen camp , north of Berlin . Once inside they were assigned to Block 19 , a special enclosure carefully fenced off and kept from all communication with the rest of the place . Compared with the other prisoners they were well treated ; there was no torture , they had good food and did not suffer from cold . They were under the charge of the SS , the Schutzstaffel troopers , who treated them politely and even made friends ; they got up a drama , in which some of the SS took part , and you might have seen the SS commander taking part in table-tennis games . But they were never permitted to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When one became hopelessly ill with TB , he was taken outside , shot , and burned in the crematorium ; later on in the war , some of those brought in were wounded and crippled men , but all were required to work and were held responsible for doing perfect work . There was only one penalty and one kind of punishment  --  death . " Sonderkommando Himmler " was the name of this group . It was continually increased in size , until at the end of the war there were a hundred and forty technicians working . They manufactured not merely paper money , but every kind of forged paper that could be of use in the German struggle : stamps , stamped envelopes , war bonds of Tito-Broz , identity cards for American and British airmen , passes for Russian police units of the NKVD , identity cards for spies in Algiers , Russian and Swiss passports , United States certificates of nationality , Red Cross notepaper , passport stamps for all the European states , rubberstamps for all diplomatic offices , reports on legations from foreignp215agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enterprise was Heydrick , chief of the Security Police , and when he was assassinated in May 1942 Ernst Kaltenbrunner took his place . RHSA were the initials of the enterprise , meaning Reichs Headquarters of the Security Amt , or Bureau . Expert engravers made the plates . The handmade paper was manufacturedoutside and came in sheets of four . There were four Monopol printing machines ; five- , ten- , twenty- , and fifty-pound notes were made . When the printing and drying were done , the sheets were not cut but torn with rulers . This tearing was done in the Reisserei , and then the notes were taken to the Sortierei , where experts with electrical apparatus studied each note , and they were held responsible for this delicate task . First-class product went to the German legations in foreigncountries ; second-class product went to secret agents ; the third was reserved until later , to be used in Britain after Germany had conqueredthat country . Several of the notes were pinned together , that being the British practice . If tiny faults were observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those faults . One corner was religiously torn off because that was the way the British did . There were processes to soil some of the notes so that they would n't look too new . Careful records were kept of everything , and these showed that a total of 134,609,945 British pounds was printed . The records showed also that in the spring of 1944 they had begun the manufacture of United States notes made by a phototype printing process . In all , they tried two hundred and twenty experiments before they got this to their satisfaction , and by that time the war was coming to an end  --  and not in the way they had planned . When the invading armies showed signs of bursting through , the whole Sonderkommando Himmler was loaded into a caravan and transportedto the concentration camp at Mauthausen , which is on the Danube River . They thought that was safe ; but presently Patton 's armies were approaching there , so they fled to the little village of Redel-Zipp . They had barely got their machines set up and ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so everything split up in confusion . The machines were taken out and dumped into a lake ; the bales of money disappeared in this direction and that . The hundred and forty Jewish technicians were loaded intop216trucks and started on what they knew was to be their last journey . But as it happened two made their escape , and the others started arguing and pleading with their guards . Since two had escaped the secret was out , and what was the good of killing the rest ? The Americanswere coming and they did n't approve of wholesale killing of innocent people ; it might well be that they would hang all the SS men who did the murders . Moreover , there was money involved , and not all of it counterfeit . There had been genuine American and British money used in making imitations and comparing the finished product . The experts had managed to hide a lot of this ; one man had a bundle of it wound up in a ball of string . Why should n't the guards share in this and scatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , and this was how it came about that British agents had been able to locate both Jewish workers and SS guards and get the detailed stories for their official report . . The most curious thing in the report , at least from the viewpoint of Lanny Budd , was the effort the Germans had made to prepare against exposure of this nefarious enterprise . The office of the Herr Doktor , Lanny 's old friend Juppchen Goebbels , issued a manifesto charging the Allies with the very crime his own gang was committing . In December1942 , at the time of the American and British invasion of North Africa , the Nazi propaganda bureau gave out a story headlined , " Algiers Flooded by Forged Banknotes . " The story first appeared in a Rome paper , to the effect that the British had brought forged Algerian banknotes with the expeditionary force ; the Bank of England had printed them and high officials of the government had issued them to British soldiers . Five-franc notes , all new in packets , labeled " Emis enFrance , serie 1944 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had wondered if they could be true . Now he called Turner 's attention to the matter , and Turner said , " It was a regular Nazi technique , and the Soviets have taken it over . Any time they give out reports that Americans have been violating the laws of war , using poison gas , germ warfare , or what have you , you may be sure the Soviets are doing it or getting ready to do it . " Lanny intended to see the President but learned that he was away on a brief vacation . He reported to the White House and waited at his hotel for orders , and the secretary phoned him that the Presidentp217desired him to talk with Undersecretary of State Acheson . So Lanny took a taxi to that part of the city derisively known as " Foggy Bottom , " where " State " had inherited a big building from " War . " There he was introduced to an elegant and courteous gentleman , a Yale man and Harvard lawyer , wearing a little mustache like Lanny himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other at the first glance and understood each other after the first sentence ; for Dean Acheson was an ardent advocate of the Truman Doctrine , which was in substance that the free world was not going to let itself be gobbled up or even eaten in small nibbles . Dean Acheson took no stock in the notion that the rearming of Turkey and Greece might result in war with the Soviet Union ; on the contrary , he was quite certain that failure to rearm them might result in their being eaten  --  though he was much too well bred a person to be aware of any pun in connection with their names . Lanny gave an account of what he had learned about Soviet doings in and around Berlin . He told of the incessant stream of abuse which Radio Berlin was pouring out upon its three former allies , especially the most powerful of them , imperialist America . Lanny knew that it was the War Department that had issued the directive forbidding RIAS to criticize the Soviets ; but he was venturing to guess that " War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy . He made his suggestion that the time had come to reconsider this matter . Rigid correctness was apparent in every detail of the appearance of Dean Gooderham Acheson and in every syllable of his speech ; the Soviets were our allies , he said , and the Germans our conquered foes , and the order of the day was courtesy to the former and a dignified reserve to the latter . " To make a formal change in our attitude toward our former allies is a grave step indeed , and we are bound to hesitate before taking it . We have entered through the proper channels our diplomatic protests to one after another of these Soviet actions . Sooner or later they become known to our people through the press and also to the peoples of our allied countries . It takes time for public opinion to change ; and you know that while it is the duty of administratorsto lead the public , we can not go too far in advance of it and so lose contact with it . " " Yes , Mr. Acheson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a great instructor , Franklin Roosevelt . He said to me , I can not go any faster than the people will let me . ' But sooner or later we are going to have to make peace with the German people , and they are going to have to make their choice between the East and the West . The Soviets have setp218out to get possession of the German mind . They have got hold of magnificent radio equipment ; they have got the best technical brains that are for sale in Berlin and are doing a first-class job . They feed the Germans music and entertainment with all kinds of propaganda interspersed , including the most vicious and cruel lies about us . All Germany is getting it , both East and West . The world is told that it is the Soviet Union that stands for unity , freedom , democracy , and peace for the German people . Research shows that they have about two-thirds of the Germans as their audience , and we and the British divide the remaining third . We ought to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by letting RIAS answer the Red arguments and correct the falsehoodsday by day as they are told . " Said the undersecretary , " I assure you , Mr. Budd , we have been thinking earnestly about the subject . In strict confidence I will tell you that I have hopes that something may be done about it soon . " So Lanny went out from the presence , and in the lobby of the buildingthere were young men waiting for him with pads of paper in their hands and eager pencils poised . How they found out about these mattersLanny did n't know , but he said to them , " I can not tell you anything about what Mr. Acheson said to me , but I will be very glad to tell you what I said to him . " They settled for that . L ANNY took a plane to New York , and in order not to disturb the Peace Group he took a taxi from the airport to Edgemere . There was Laurel ready to be locked in his arms ; and there was that newly arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this resting place as long as it could . This was Lanny 's third child , but he had never got over marveling at the strangeness of this method of getting life into existence . It seemed to him messy and precarious ,  |p219altogether  unbelievable , yet here it was . It seemed to him that if he had been consulted in advance he could have devised a number of ways that would have been more safe and convenient . He was one of those of whom the old-time Persian had written ; he would have liked to grasp this sorry scheme of things entire and remold it nearer to the heart 's desire . Meantime here was this nursling , this bundle of well-rounded flesh , clutching and clamoring , being watched and carefully trained . They had named her after her mother , and she would be known as Baby Laurel ; inevitably that would be shortened to Babe , which was not a dignified title , but it would be a long time before she would know it . Among her watchers , now and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged five and known as Junior . He was full of delight at the phenomenon and also full of awe ; when he asked questions he was not told a story about a stork but about motherhood . There were all the members and employees of the Peace Group to be greeted . They crowded into the parlor of the old-fashioned house to hear Lanny tell about what he had seen and learned in Germany . Later on they heard him tell some of it over the radio ; nothing about counterfeiting and spying , of course , but all about RIAS , a sort of distant cousin of the Peace Program . He stated plainly his reason for believing that the Soviets were bent upon making world peace impossible ; and that , of course , brought the customary crop of letters from the fellow travelers , including the grower of avocados and winter vegetables in Pahokee , Florida . Another letter came , marked " Personal " and signed " Rotterdam "  --  that being the city in which Hansi Robin had been born and raised and from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lanny Budd . " I am twelve , " he had written then , " and I practice now a Beethoven romance for violin . " Now Hansi could play everything that Beethoven had written for the violin , most of it from memory . He wrote to say , " I want to see you ; will telephone at lunchtime . " That was the hour when Lanny would be at the house , and it was notice to him to answer the phone himself . He did so , and when he heard the familiar voice he said promptly , " Okay , name the time and place . " Hansi replied , " Lexington Avenue and Thirty-second Street , northeast corner , tomorrow , two o'clock sharp . " Lanny said , " Okay , " and Hansi repeated the directions once more and then without anotherp220word hung up . They had agreed to take extreme precautions , and it was understood that Hansi was never to phone from his house but to take a walk and call from a pay station where he was not known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a side street in the neighborhood and read a newspaper until a minute or two before the hour . Then he drove around a couple of blocks and exactly on the second arrived at the corner specified . There was Hansi , approachingon a side street , wearing a pair of dark glasses on a hot summer day . The car stopped for a few seconds , he stepped in , and away they went up Lexington Avenue , through the Harlem slums and the wilds of the Bronx , and on out into the country . Hansi sat slumped in his seat , as inconspicuous as possible , and they talked . " Lanny , I 'm in hell , " said the violinist , slumped in soul as well as in body . Lanny knew only too well what Hansi was suffering  --  having suffered the same things himself . " What have you found out ? " " Bess drove to a town out on Long Island where there is a factory making proximity fuses . One of the employees of the company gave her a package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and personally delivered it to a Red photographic concern . " " And what are our authorities going to do about it ? " " They are following it up . They want to get all the gang , and I have to help them . Against my own wife ! " Lanny was n't too shocked ; he had prepared himself for exactly this . Also , he had prepared what he was going to say to his brother-in-law and dear friend . " I know how you feel , Hansi . You have to do just what the Communists have done , turn yourself to steel . You are renderingan important service to your country and to all the free world . " Lanny said it , but it sounded hollow . He had n't been able to turn his own self to steel . His hands were trembling , and he had to grip the steering wheel tighter . " It 's the woman I love ! " exclaimed Hansi in the voice of the doomed . " It 's the most awful thing , Lanny . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me loves her and another part of me hates her , and I 'm torn in halves . " " I know how you feel , old fellow . Do n't forget , she 's my sister . " " Oh , but that is not the same as a wife ! And a sweetheart ! She has always been both . It tortures me all the time . I do n't know how I can stand it . I chose the wrong profession . For such a duty I should have been an actor . " " Every artist is an actor , Hansi . You become what you play . Mozartp221or Beethoven , Paganini or Kreisler  --  they are such different persons . " " That is for the time being , and it is only play ; but this is something that goes on all the time and that I ca n't get away from . I am acting a lie , my whole life becomes a lie , and I ca n't help despising myself . " " You know , Hansi , I have been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's why I came to you , Lanny . You 've been through it . But I 'm not so firm in mind , so rational as you are . I 'm chicken-hearted ! My nerve is breaking . Honestly , I do n't know how I can stand it ! " Yes , Lanny understood what was in the soul of this onetime shepherd boy from ancient Judea . He was suffering the ethical pangs of his people , in whom good and evil had wrestled for some five thousand traditional years . He was that shepherd boy David , who had been " a cunning player on an harp " and had played before Saul , the great king . The son of Budd-Erling had never been crowned a king , but he had been a prince in the eyes of a Jewish lad of humble parentage ; he had been rich and elegant , with all the social graces and the love of all the arts . So now what Hansi wanted was to pour out his soul to this wonder- ful Lanny Budd . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles of a man who had never lied before and now had to make hiswhole life a fabric woven of lies . He wanted to have Lanny tell him over and over again that it was his duty to do it , that he must do it , that he must never weaken , that he must match in his soul the grim determination of Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili , who had taken for his professional name Stalin , meaning steel . Hansi had to make love to a woman whom he half loved and half hated . Lanny was able to assure him that that was by no means an uncommon experience , both in the grand monde in which Lanny had lived and in the various small worlds he had visited . Hansi had to lie and lie and be a villain ; and Lanny was able to assure him that that too was no extraordinary phenomenon in the world of affairs . Hansi had to learn to be one thing in his secret soul and something quite different when he went out into the world ; that was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the stage of business and politics  --  all the men and women merely players . It was something that every fashionable mother taught to her daughter , preparing her for a careerof social charm and the capture of a desirable life partner .  | " Look , Hansi , " said his worldly friend , " you told me that Bess had been admitted to study at the Lenin Academy in Moscow , an honor granted to very few Americans . Did she tell you what they taught her ? " " They taught her the economic and political principles of Lenin . " " Did she tell you they taught her anything about spying ? " " No , she did n't mention that . " " Of course she would n't , because the first thing they taught her was that under no circumstances must she reveal to anyone but those of the party 's inner circle what the true economic and political principles of Lenin are . If Bess was going out to be a friend and promoter of communismshe would vigorously deny to everybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capitalist governments . Communists are always for peace , and it is the capitalist imperialists who threaten and make war . The only place where Communiststalk frankly is among trusted party members ; and if anyone were to voice pacific ideas there he would be immediately classified as a cosmopolitan deviationist and Social Fascist . " As it works out in practice , no party member can be sure what any other party member really believes or what he is up to . He may have been sent to tempt you and try you out to make sure that your ideas are true to the party line of the moment . Also , thousands of party members are trained to become what are called sleepers ' ; they remain loyal and true in their hearts and they report to some leader , but they go out into the world as non-Communists ; they make an intensive study of the ideas and practices of some other party , some creed , some social group . They join that group and live as members and work subtly and secretly to undermine it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently on my trip to Berlin . In a. social gathering I met a German gentleman of high position , a scholar and a true liberal , who had made sacrifices for his ideas . Present also was his wife , a charming lady who told me that she had become a Quaker ; she had become convinced that the only way to get world peace was to take an out-and-out position and make no compromise under any circumstances . She set forth her Quaker creed , and I was impressed by it and by her ; but next day I received a note from the gentleman , saying , I feel it my duty to inform you that my wife is a Communist . ' "  |p223Hansi  knew about sleepers , it turned out . He was now trusted enough to learn about techniques and devices ; his own duties had been explained to him , and he was being given a sort of trial run . " Bess has been put in charge of me , " he said . " I am not to be a sleeper but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a name . There are many sincere persons who are gullible and let themselves be used by the Communists , who get up all kinds of organizations with high-sounding titles in the name of worthy causes . Or a group of the sleepers will move in upon some old established organization ; one will become a stenographer in the office and will rise to become executive secretary and run the whole affair . There are Civil Liberties sleepers and Racial Equality sleepers and Antimilitarist sleepers and Freedom of Immigration sleepers  --  to make it easy for Communist agents to come and go and to raise bail for them when they get caught . All these organizations hold mass meetingssponsored by a list of distinguished names , and there they make speeches in which they say , I am no Communist , but , ' and they go on to advocate whatever set of ideas happens to fit the party line at the moment . " " Oh , I am so sick of them ! " broke in the violinist . " I know , Hansi . Imagine how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years . He would start spouting and work himself into a frenzy just talking to me , or anybody . He never knew when to stop ; he would go on and on until I thought I was getting dizzy ; but I could n't let my mind wander for a moment . I had to be attentive and ready to put in a word or even a nod of agreement . I had to make a psychological study of it , to take it as a game and devote myself to playing it . You , a violinist , learn to play a cadenza ; you know it 's no good , it does n't say anything , it 's just a showpiece ; but it 's there , and you learn to do it with a flourish and enjoy the doing . " " That helps , Lanny , " said the man of music gratefully . " I will try to take it that way . " " Let me tell you something interesting that I read in an English magazine on my trip home . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe called the Marindese . They are headhuntersbut not cannibals ; they do n't eat the bodies of those they slay ; they do their killing because of a philosophy . It seems that their childrenhave to have names , and the names are no good unless they arep224taken from a person who bore them in life . The victim 's head , which is shrunk and preserved , is merely a symbol of the name . If a child has to grow up without a name he is miserable and feeble all his life . So the tribe sends out spies to watch carefully the habits of some nearby tribe . They make elaborate ceremonial preparations , and then on a certain night they steal up on the tribe and in a sudden attack slaughter a great many of the men and bring home their heads ; they also bring home the children of their victims , in order to make sure of finding out the names of the fathers who have been killed . So the Marindese children get names and grow up happy and strong . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commentedHansi . " Yes , but with a curious reverse twist . The Marindese want to take the names of their victims , but the Reds want to give their names to the victims . When the class struggle is over we shall be just as poor and miserable as they are now , but we shall no longer be American imperialistspreaching the Truman Doctrine ; we shall be **35;6700;TOOLONG - Fosterites , living under the dictatorship of the proletariat and learning the Diamat and the Proletcult . All great philosophicalquestions will have been settled , and only details will be left ; and we shall be back in the fourth century , when men fought and died for the difference between Homoousianismn and Homoiousianism . " " Oh God ! " exclaimed Hansi . " You should see the things I have to study and the lessons I have to recite ! I am trying to please Bess and to convince her that I am seriously interested in this new mumbojumbo . I have to learn the dangers of objectism , practicism , opportunism , scholasticism , cosmopolitanism . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to promise never to fall victim to any of them . I must hold exactly the right and only true doctrine  --  which some professor of metaphysics in the Kremlin has dreamed up only last week . " " And next week , " said Lanny with a chuckle , " the Politburo will decide that the professor was a Trotskyite , and he will be shipped off to work in a gold mine in Verkhoyansk , the coldest spot on earth , and you will have a new doctrine to learn . " Hansi said it did him a world of good to have somebody to pour out his troubles to . He would go back into Hades and try his earnest best to acclimatize himself . He had to be told over and over again that itp225was an honorable thing to be a spy in the cause of human freedom ; and Lanny pointed again to those black savages in the wilds of New Guinea . The reason the Marindese tribe had so many heads to hang in their doorways was that their spies were active and determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterspies had failed . Eternal vigilance was still the price of liberty , and not merely in steaming tropical jungles but in the world of jet airplanes and atomic bombs . " Look , Hansi , " said Hansi 's brother-in-law , " I was a spy working against Adolf Hitler ; I was trying to keep him from starting his world war . I did n't succeed , but I thought I had a chance . I knew that he believed in astrology and spiritualism and all that sort of thing , and I trained Laurel to pretend that she was a wonderful spiritualist medium . I taught her all about the Nazi old companions , ' the only people Hitler ever respected and listened to ; then I called up Hess and told him about her , and we were invited to the Berghof . We were in that mountain retreat , crowded with diplomats and top military men , all buzzing and seething like bees , and Laurel went into her pretended trance  --  that was the way she found out that she could really go into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to Haushofer , and Dietrich Eckart , and the other dead heroes of his movement , warning him against going to war . We did actually cause him to put off the movement of those armies for a full week . We gave the free world that much more time to realize the situation . And who can ever know how much difference it made ? Laurel and I were spying as hard as we could , and we were lying like the devil , both of us ; but can anybody tell us that we were n't doing a moral action ? " Hansi thought it over . " I suppose that only an out-and-out pacifist could say no . " " Yes ; you can be a Quaker , you can turn the other cheek to the attacker and give him your cloak too . I ca n't think of any nation that ever tried it , but we could try it tomorrow if we adopted the Sermon on the Mount as our code . We could announce that we would make no resistance to communist philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waving red flags and singing the Internationale . ' Our government would step quietly aside and Foster would become chief commissar , and Jack Stachel would become commander-in-chiefof the Army . They would last about three months , until the Politburo decided they were devotees of cosmopolitanism or scholasticism , and then they would be replaced by Russians . The workers would take possession of the factories , and in about one monthp226they would all be put in charge of a commissar . The farms would be collectivized , and the same thing would happen there . In another three months the Politburo would have decided that Americans were incorrigibleand must all be forbidden to hold public office . All our books on political and economic questions would be burned , and the Russian language would become compulsory in our public schools . " Some of those things are happening in Central Europe now , and the rest will be happening before long ; anybody who is willing to see them happen in the United States will , of course , say that I was wrong to report my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon your wife . What I say is that it is not your duty to let your wife go on betraying the military secrets of our country to our furious and embittered enemies . What I say is that you and I were born into a dangerous time , and we have to learn to fight the devil with his own fire . I admit that we have new freedoms to win , economic freedoms , but we can win them without sacrificing the old freedoms which are infinitely precious to us . That has to be our religion , Hansi . " So they talked , and when they were nearing the city again Hansi said , " There 's no use your going down into that traffic , and besides it 's risky . If I 'm going to be a spy I had better be a good one , and I do n't want anyone to see us together . " Lanny assented and let his friend off at the nearest subway station , where he could take an express and reach Pennsylvania Station in a third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Bridge into Jersey and so home . He told Laurel about the talk and about Hansi 's state of soul ; but he did not mention what Bess was doing , for that was " classified . " Laurel said , " I 'm sorry for both of them , but most of all , I think , for those two boys . Adults know what they are doing ; but what can children make of it ? " Lanny 's answer was , " I have seen so many children suffering in Europe that I seem to be losing the power to worry about individuals . " " That is getting to be true of everybody , " replied Laurel , " and it is a form of moral death . It may be the end of our civilization . " A few days passed , and Lanny at the office was called to the telephone ; it happened often , but this call was unusual  --  the voice of Bess . " Lanny , I want to see you , " she said . " Sure thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I do n't want to come to the office , and I do n't want to come to your house , because I know I 'm not welcome at either , and I 'm bored by both . " " Okay , " said Lanny cheerfully . " Name the place and time . " " I will drive to your neighborhood and make it easy for you , " she said and named the nearby village of Beverly . " I 'll be in front of the post office at ten tomorrow morning . " " I 'll be on hand , " he said . And that was that . He told Laurel about it , and Laurel said with a smile , " Do n't let her convert you . " If she had had any idea that the effort might be successfulshe would have gone along . They both took it for granted that what Bess wanted was to enter another protest against the broadcasts , especially those in which Lanny told what he had learned in Berlin , including the determination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lanny drove to the village appointed , parked his car around the cornerfrom the post office , locked it , and went for a stroll . Presently Bess came . She drew up to the side , opened the door , and said , " Get in . " He took the seat beside her and closed the door , and after that she had him at her mercy ; she could drive as long as the gas in the tank held out , and he would have to listen . But it was n't what he had come prepared for . Bess 's opening sentencewas enough to send a chill all over him . " Lanny , why ca n't you let my husband alone ? " He would have had to turn his head to look at her , and he chose to look straight down the road . " What do you mean , Bess ? " he inquired in as toneless a voice as he could manage . " You know exactly what I mean . " He might have said , " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How did you find out ? " But he did n't want to say either of those things ; he wanted time to gather his wits ; he was like a boxer who rolls with a heavy punch . He said , " Hansi was my friend a long time before he was yours , Bess . " " Yes , but he was never your husband . And I want to know whether you have made up your mind that it is your duty to break up our marriage . " He had got a few moments to think . Could Hansi have told her ? Surely not ! The telephone call  --  at his end or at her end ? Was there a spy in his home or in hers ? These Communists were everywhere ! Had they followed Hansi into New York ? Or Lanny from Edgemere ? He had the feeling of being besieged.  |p228There  was a large elm tree growing by the roadside , offering welcomeshade . Bess turned off the road and stopped the car , and there they could sit and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple settling their love problems , or possibly a married couple trying to settle their quarrel . They would hardly guess that it was a pro-Soviet secret agent engaged in a dueling match with an American counteragent . Bess came right to the point , as was her custom . " Lanny , you helped to make this marriage , and I was boundlessly grateful , and thought I would be grateful all my life ; but now you are trying to break it up , and that is a horrid thing . " " You are mistaken , Bess , " he declared . " Neither Laurel nor I has the slightest desire to break it up . " " You know that we have been quarreling and have been utterly miserable ; but now Hansi has come to an understanding of what I am doing , and why should you consider it your duty to ruin it ? We have been so happy again  --  it has been like another honeymoon . " " I assure you again , Bess , you are mistaken . " He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one word to Hansi against you . " But that would have been admitting that he had met Hansi , and he had made up his mind in a quick flash that he was n't going to admit anything . He was going to let her talk , and listen carefully , and learn what he could about how much she knew . " Everything you say to him is an effort to poison his mind against me . You know that the Communist movement has become my whole life , and now you have turned into a fanatical reactionary . Every word that you speak is an attack upon me . " A sudden hope was dawning in his mind . Maybe it was just the radio she was talking about . Maybe she had caught Hansi listening to the Peace Program ! " This is a free country , Bess , " he said , deliberately platitudinous . " You say what you believe , and I say what I believe . " " Yes , but why do you have to say it to my husband ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So it was n't the radio ! He did not answer , and she went on , " What has he to give you now ? From your point of view he is a softhead , a slave to a woman . He 's a dupe and a dummy ; he will go on repeating the Communistp229formulas , as you say , like a phonograph . Do you have to listen to that phonograph ? You 've got millions of people listening to you  --  why ca n't you be content with that and let my one man alone ? " It was a cogent argument , and he had no answer ready . The idea was forming in his mind that maybe she did n't know anything definite ; she just had the suspicion that there had been a meeting  --  maybe from some word that Hansi had let slip . If she had had definite information that he had taken a long drive with Hansi she could hardly have helped bringing the charge . The temptation to boast of it and to frighten him would have been strong . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as careful as he was . She was by now a well-trained spy , and she would n't give him any hint that would put him on the track of her sources . She would be listening to his every word as carefully as he was listening to hers . He had an advantage over her in that he knew that she knew about him , but she did n't know that he knew about her . That was a subtle advantage and could be used only with extreme care . It was like a harvest which could not be reaped wholesale but had to be picked out grain by grain . " Tell me just what you want me to do , Bess , " said he . What you want me to do  --  not what you want me not to do ! That would obviouslyhave been fishing for information . " I have told you more than once what I want you to do , Lanny . I want you to let Hansi alone . He can be of no use to you . He is nothing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can deal with theoretical ideas . " That was n't true , of course . Hansi Robin , labeled as a Communist and appearing on public platforms before great crowds of Leftists , was a powerful propagandist , and incidentally a rich source of funds . But Lanny did n't say that , for it would have meant an argument . He might have said , " I 'll make a deal with you ; I wo n't try to persuade him if you will not use him for propaganda . " But she would have rejectedthat proposal , and Lanny was n't at all sure that the FBI people would approve it , for the more useful Hansi made himself to the party the more quickly would he be taken into the party 's inner circles . What the half-brother said was , " I assure you , Bess , I wish Hansi all the happiness in the world , and I would n't do anything to interfere with it . " " Oh , Lanny , what rubbish ! " she exclaimed . " One would think you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours and listened to youp230pour contempt and abuse upon my cause ? Everything you say has been meant to alienate Hansi from me  --  and for years it has done exactlythat . " " I am sorry , Bess , if you take it that personal way . I have my beliefs , and you have yours , and both of us have expressed them . You yourself said to me the last time we met that individuals do not matter , only the cause matters . Do n't you remember saying that ? " " Yes , I remember it , but I have to take it back ; I was mistaken . One individual matters to me , and matters terribly . I have been wretchedly unhappy because I saw Hansi being separated from me . " Her voice was trembling , and for the first time he turned his head and looked at her . There were tears in her eyes . " I know , Bess , " he said gently , because he too was a husband and a lover . " I love him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so happy with him that I was in heaven . The cause that I believed in  --  the cause that you taught both of us  --  was a bond between us . I thought we could never be parted except by death . But then I saw that you were ceasing to believe in that cause , and then I saw that you were influencingHansi against it . I was tempted to hate you , but I could n't bear to hate you . I do n't hate you now ; I am only heartbroken about it . " " Where you make your mistake , Bess , is in not realizing your cause has changed . It is not the cause I believed in or ever could believe in . I was talking about social justice , brought about by honest means , by free and open discussion , and by the democratic process which we in America know and have practiced for centuries . " " It was a dream , Lanny . It can not come that way , because the world is not ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You face a situation from which there is no escape . You either have to support the revolutionary proletariat or see the world thrown back once more into complete and utter black reaction . " So there they were , ready for their argument all over again . " Listen for a minute , Bess , " he said . " You want me to face facts . I have just been in Soviet-controlled territory . I thought of you often during that trip because I had your arguments in my mind . I would say to myself , What would Bess make of this ? ' Be patient and let me tell you some of the facts that I gathered . " " All right , Lanny , " she said ; she had asked him a favor , and shep231could not refuse one . " Tell me your facts , but do n't be surprised if I call them White lies . " There was a capital letter in that word as Bess used it in her thoughts ; it did n't mean what it had meant in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies told by the forces of " feudal reaction . " " Let me give you just one illustration . Did you ever hear of the Katyn massacre ? " " Oh , my God , Lanny , are you going to tell me that stale old fan-tasy ? " " It is two years old and it may be stale , but I assure you it is coming back to fresh life . " " Everybody knows that the crime was committed by the Nazis , and they have been making a frantic effort to pin it on the Soviets . " " That is what the Kremlin has told the world , Bess ; but I assure you it is a case of truth crushed to earth , and it is bound to rise again . Stalin deliberately massacred fourteen or fifteen thousand Polish officersbecause he wanted to make it impossible for Poland ever to be revived as a nation . " " Poland is being revived rapidly right now , I assure you  --  but as a nation of peasants and workers , and not of aristocrats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same method of killing and exile to slavelaborcamps , and it is being done not on Polish soil , because the Kremlinhas taken a great part of the Polish soil and put the Poles on the territory of the Germans . That is the way the seeds of new wars are planted , for it should be perfectly evident to you that the Germans are not going to submit to giving up their land forever to the Poles . Some seven million Germans have been driven out of Silesia and UpperSilesia and the other border provinces . And Poland is no longer Poland ; it is becoming a Soviet satellite . The Polish peasants will exist by raising potatoes for the Soviets and selling them at a low price , and buying back machinery from the Soviets at a high price . That may be your idea of social justice , but it surely is n't mine . " So they wrangled , and it was the same as it had been for the past two years , ever since the Politburo had decreed the end of the wartime alliance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if the Politburo told her that something was a White lie , she was sure it was a White lie . As for Red lies , there could , of course , be no such thing . Lanny said to her , " I wonder , Bess , do you really believe all these things , or do you only say that you believe them , because that is the party 's orders ? "  |p232Her  answer was , " There is no use being nasty , Lanny . We do n't get anywhere by insulting each other . " " No  --  but look . I see you following the party line ; I see you shifting your point of view overnight , turning right around in your tracks and saying the opposite of what you said the day before  --  whenever the party line changes . Can it be possible for any thinking person to do that and not see there is something phony about it , something crazy ? " " You are talking rubbish , Lanny . I never did any such thing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler made his deal with Stalin , in August 1939 ? I knew Hitler and I knew that was coming , and I told you so . Do n't you remember how you flew into a fury with me ; you called it an obscene idea , a consequence of my associating with the rotten ruling classes . Then the deal was announced and all the Communists had to shift overnight . That deal was permissiongranted Hitler to attack Poland ; and it was not merely a deal for that one purpose : it was complete cooperation between German nazismand Russian communism , which lasted to the very day that Hitler attacked Russia . For almost two years they were allies . " " You will have to prove that to me , " said Bess . " If you do not know it , " Lanny answered , " it 's because you did not follow your own party doings . Countless tons of literature attacking Britain and attacking the Jews were printed in Germany and shipped from Hamburg in Russian vessels to Vladivostok , and from there to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . Members of the German-American Bund received orders to join the Communists and work with them in the United States  --  of course for peace , to be brought about by means of agitation and strikes in Americanindustry . " " You seem to know a great deal about Communist party affairs , " remarked the woman sarcastically , and Lanny realized that it might n't be good to reveal any more . He answered quietly , " These things are well known to the public , and if you do n't know them it 's because you do n't want to . It was by that deal with Hitler that Stalin got the eastern third of Poland , and to satisfy the Poles Stalin later gave them the eastern third of Germany . He had to murder millions of human beings to do it and exile ten millions from their homes ; but that did n't mean a thing to Joe Stalin . Human beings as such mean no more to him than so many potatobugs to be exterminated with DDT . " That was a mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Soviet father and saved her from having to answer forp233her party-line shifts . They wrangled all over Europe and Asia , and Lanny said that Bess was a phonograph , and Bess said that Lanny was a puppet of the Truman Doctrine and was trying to buy both Europe and Asia with Marshall Plan money . At last she broke out , " We 're not getting anywhere ! ' We 're just hating each other ! I did n't come for this . I ca n't make any impression on you , and I know that you ca n't make any on me . What I came for was to beg you just one thing : let my husband alone ! " He answered her very gravely and carefully , " Bess , I have no presentreason for seeing Hansi and I have no present intention of seeing him . I am perfectly willing to promise you that if I do see him again I will carefully avoid saying anything to turn him against you and to interfere with your happiness . " He could say that quite truthfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with or persuade Hartsi on the subject of world communism and its determination to " be the human race . " So she drove him back to his own car , and they parted . At Shepherdstown , through which he passed , he sought out a telephone pay station , shut himself up in the little booth , and put in a person-to-personcall to Hansi Robin at his home . He listened in while the operator got Mr. Robin , and then he said , " Is Mr. Rotterdam there ? " " There 's no such person here , " was the answer . That was Hansi speaking ; it was code , arranged between them . There were telephones both on the ground floor and the second floor of Hansi 's house , and thus a possibility of someone listening in . Lanny said , " Call Shepherdstown1438 immediately . " " You must have the wrong number , " said the voice of Hansi . " I repeat , Shepherdstown 1438 . " And Lanny hung up . They had taken pains to work out this arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pay station where he was not known , or at any rate would not attract attention . He was then to call the number Lanny had given . So Lanny waited , strolling up and down , near enough so that he could hear the sound of the bell , and meantime pondering a mystery . He thought of the people who were in Hansi 's house and the people who were in his own house and in the office and what part any one of them could have played in the betrayal . He had been struck by the fact that Bess had not revealed knowledge of the circumstances of the meeting between himself and her husband . Itp234seemed humanly unlikely that she would have failed to boast of her knowledge if she had possessed it . She would have tried to pin him down as to where they had gone and how long they had been together . It seemed the best guess that some party member , knowing Lanny and Hansi by sight , had seen them driving in the car . A man came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hansi would get a report that the line was busy ; but he would n't give up . So Lanny waited until at last he heard a ring and stepped to the phone , and there was Hansi . Neither spoke the other 's name ; they knew each other 's voices . Lanny said , " Did you tell Isabella about our meeting ? " " Certainly not , " was the reply in a tone of surprise . " I was quite sure you had n't , but I wanted to warn you . We must be more careful . She came to see me and wanted me to promise not to see you . I did promise that I would n't try to change your ideas . I ca n't be sure how it happened , but I am guessing that someone saw us . Anyhow , be warned . " " There is something important going on , " said the other voice , " but I ca n't talk about it . " " Of course not . Good luck , and do n't worry too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monck . He gave more details of that strange cold war that was going on with Berlin as its focal point . Berlin , the helpless , unwilling city  --  Monck compared it to the living prey for which two fierce beasts contend , pulling it this way and that and snarling at each other . " Hate is a blind thing , " Monck wrote . " They are hoping to drive you Americans out , but they are only making you angry . " Lanny examined his own heart and realized that this was true . Day by day as the news came in he found that he was thinking less about the Russian people , who were as helpless as the Germans , and more about those masters in the Kremlin , those men of hatred and lies who were making the name " Russian " odious to all decent and honest people in the world . It was all so needless , so utterly senseless ; yet here it was , the whole civilized world being kept in torment , torn in half , and perhaps doomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately concocted falsehoods . Monck never wrote more than a line or two about his own work . " We are making progress , " he said , " but slowly . " And then he added a puzzling sentence : " The deaf French girl is at work . " Lanny stopped and searched his memory ; he had n't met any French girl in Germany that he could recall , and certainly no deaf one . He read on : " She has met Ferdinand , and I think something is developing between them . That indeed would be a complication , and I would n't know what to expect from it . " Suddenly it flashed over Lanny what Monck was doing  --  making up a code as he wrote . No code name had been assigned Anna Surden , or at any rate it had n't been told to Lanny . Now Monck was giving him one . Monck had lived in Paris and worked with Lanny there , and both of them knew the language . He was making a pun on the Frenchp238word sourde , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give Lanny the clue . Plainly he was suggesting that Anna and Fritz Meissner were involved in some sort of affair ; and that was a curious development indeed . In Lanny 's conference with Morrison and Monck the suggestion had been that Anna might get hold of one of the Himmler-money men , but apparently no one of the three had thought of the possibility that Fritz might be the victim . Yet what could be more natural ? Fritz was there , home from school ; he was at the susceptible age , and to a female spy on the hunt he would present himself as the perfect target . To Lanny , looking down upon the scene as it were from heaven , this presented a complex set of problems . There was Fritz with his three psychologies  --  the Social Democrat pretending to be a Nazi pretending to be a Communist . There was the " deaf French girl , " pretending to have no political psychology  --  or was she pretending ? For the purpose of her work she would presumably be a Nazi pretending to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis ; they would be two spies , neither of them knowing that the other was a spy . Would they discover each other , or would one discover the other without telling the other  --  and which would do the discovering , and which would be discovered ? And what would be the result of this combination ? It was like a chemist pouring two unknown chemicalsinto a test tube . They might lie together inertly , or they might blow up the laboratory . Also , Lanny was concerned about the human aspect of this situation . He had adopted that ardent German lad , to make up for the lad 's lost father ; and now what was this girl going to do to him ? Lanny could n't be sure , because he did n't know the girl well enough . The fact that she had tried to attach herself to Lanny did n't mean as much as it would have meant in America , for Germany was a war-torn land and its women , especially the young , were frantic . For them the command had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life while yet the little lamp glows ; pluck the rose before it fades away . " After the end of World War I the young Lanny Budd , disgusted with the results of the Paris Peace Conference , had announced that he was going to the Riviera and lie on the sand and watch the world come to an end . In those days he had been independent and fancy free and could say such things . Now , twenty-seven years later , he hadp239watched another and still more calamitous world war , and again had suffered disillusionment and been tempted to despair . But he was no longer fancy free ; he had a program and an organization and some thirty people dependent upon him and his decisions . He had to meet issues , he had to keep appointments , he had to wear a cheerful aspect and be dependable and confident and prompt . He took to taking long walks , to wrestle things out with himself and be sure of what he really believed and really wanted to do . Thirty years ago the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent young spirits of the time , Lanny had hailed it with hope . As ' Wordsworth wrote of the French revolution , " Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive/But to be young was very heaven . " Lincoln Steffens had traveled to what was then Petrograd and talked to Lenin , and had come back to Paris and told Lanny , " I have seen the future and it works . " But now poor old Stef was no more ; he had died disillusioned and brokenhearted , as Lanny well knew . But Lanny was n't ready to die , and he could n't afford to show weakness ; he had to think things out and meet the emergencies of his time . The true Russian Revolution , the Socialist Revolution of the spring of 1917 , was no more ; it had become just another despotism , old-style with a new-style camouflage . The Soviets were no more ; they were just a pretense , a propaganda device . The constitution was fine on paper and wholly imaginary so far as practice was concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone with the wind . There was cruelty and terror beyond any imagining of the Western world ; there was deadly hate , animal cunning  --  and age-long patience . With the help of the Western world Stalin had conquered all the states along his western border , beginning with Esthonia and all the way down to Bulgaria . He had blandly promised free , independent , democratic governments for all those states , and then had proceeded , no less blandly , to make them over in his own image by his tools of terror and fraud . This process Lanny watched in his daily newspapers . The chancelleries of the Allied states watched it also and made their periodic protests , which came to nothing . Thus on the eleventh of June 1947 the State Department disclosed that it had sent a note to the Soviet authorities in Budapest , charging that the Russians had taken unilateral action " in most flagrant interferencein Hungarian affairs . " Three days later President Truman , signing peace treaties with Hungary , Bulgaria , and Rumania , rebuked those states for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a note to Rumania , charging that the arrest of oppositionmembers of the parliament was a deliberate effort to suppress democratic elements by " terroristic intimidation . " Two days after that the United States delegate to the UN Security Council urged the Council to permit the use of force to prevent Yugoslavia , Albania , and Bulgaria from aiding armed bands that were violating Greek territory . So it went day after day , week after week , and all the protests were spitting against the wind . At the beginning of June Secretary of State Marshall put forward his plan for American financial aid to European states , provided that they would adopt a uniform plan for recovery . There was nothing in that proposal to threaten the Soviet Union , unless the USSR was bent upon conquest of the other states . But the Reds chose to take it as a hostile action and broke up a conference with France and Britain on the subject . Czechoslovakia had eagerly accepted the offer of Marshall aid , but Masaryk was peremptorily summoned to Moscow and commandedto reverse this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . So it was that the director of the Peace Program changed his mind and decided to keep it changed in spite of all the protests of the fellow travelers and the sleepers who wrote him letters . Lanny Budd became a militarist . When President Truman called for universal military trainingto prepare American youth for resistance , Lanny was for it ; the Republicans were against it because Truman proposed it . There was warm discussion inside the Peace Group , and they compromised on the open-forum formula . They would get some supporter of the Presidentto defend UMT , and they would get some genuine pacifist  --  if they could find one  --  to oppose it . In August the British set India free , and that was one of history 's great acts of statesmanship . It was the action of the British Labour party and the Socialist intellectuals who had been for two generations its leaders and guides . If the Soviet Union had been a real Socialist state , with a real belief in democracy and freedom , this action would have met with thunderous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reds hated Ernie Bevin even more than they hated Churchill ; for Churchill was a foe they felt they could beat in the end , but Bevin was the man they really feared , the man who could win the workers of the world away from Stalinism.  |p241Early  in the month of August the State Department issued the charge that the Rumanian government had violated the peace treaty with the United States by suppressing the National Peasant party and arresting its leader . A week or so later the United States introduced into the UN Security Council a resolution ordering the governments of the Balkan satellites of the Soviet Union to cease sending military aid to Greek Communist guerrillas ; and this resolution was denounced by Soviet delegate Gromyko as " the crudest interference " in the internal affairs of Greece . Next the United States denounced the death sentence passed on the Bulgarian opposition leader Petkof as " a gross miscarriage of justice . " The State Department revealed that it had made another protest to the USSR against the continued occupation of the Chinese port of Dairen in violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant was the statement by the American general who headed the U. S.-Russian Joint Commission in Korea , that the Soviet delegation was attempting to " usurp the functions " of this Joint Commission . It seemed strange to listeners of the Peace Program that Lanny Budd should trouble to mention what was going on in far-off Korea ; and when he explained its significance he discovered that there were letter writers who thought it was imperialistic of the United States to try to keep the Soviets from seizing a dagger pointed at the heart of Japan , but did n't find it at all imperialistic that the Soviets should be trying to seize that dagger . Both sides had solemnly agreed to permit the oppressed people of Korea to choose their own government in free and secret elections . But as usual the Reds were determined that the new government should be set up by the small Communist minority . Professor Samuel Goudsmit came to speak on the program . He was a Jewish physicist , born in Holland , who had come to America when he was young . Toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alsos Mission , a team of physicists sent out with a military escort to find out what German scientists had achieved , and incidentally to persuade them to come to America . Either the Americans would get them , or the British , or the French , or the Russians , and there was eager rivalry in this hunt . Lanny Budd had joined Alsos and had had some adventures ; now they delighted to talk these over , for Sam Goudsmit was a genial soul , full of fun and stories . But there was n't much fun on the subject of the A-bomb . It wasp242the biggest of all the bones of contention being fought over in the UN sessions . To every project or suggestion of disarmament the Sovietswould reply with one demand : the first step must be the outlawingand destruction of those A-bombs . The meaning , of course , was obvious to everyone with brains in his head . Once the United States ceased to hold that " sword of Damocles " over the head of the Reds , the balance of power would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flock of warplanes , whereas the United States had disbandedmost of its Army and had put its planes in mothballs . The Reds would have Western Germany at their mercy ; they would stage an uprising there and send in arms to enable the oppressed workers to defend themselves ; then indeed Berlin would be an " island . " There were millions of Communists in Italy and France , willing and eager to repeat the same performance . And once the Reds had got the Ruhr and set up the installations for bigger and better V-2 rockets on the Channel coast , what chance would there be of survival for Britain ? Lanny asked what chance there was of the Reds getting the allimportantsecret , and Goudsmit said they were certain to get it in the end ; they had some very good German scientists and also a few good ones of their own . These men were being well treated and given every facility . No doubt they understood that the continuance of their lives depended upon just one thing : the achievement of an atomic chain reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how soon this was apt to happen , and Goudsmit said he did n't know , and would n't be free to tell if he did know ; the estimates of physicists ran from eight to fifteen years . Lanny , who was spy-conscious , pointed to the Soviet spy ring which had been getting atomic secrets in Canada and wondered if that same thing was happening in the U. S. A. Goudsmit , who was employed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory , the new atomic plant the government had under construction on Long Island , said that he felt sure there were no traitors or spies in his organization . It would be an awful thing indeed if there were . Lanny was glad to introduce this learned gentleman to the radio audience ; he was the accredited co-discoverer of the so-called " spin of the nucleus . " Lanny said there were so many marvels being revealed in this ultramicroscopic universe that it was hard for a layman to keep track of them  --  especially when he was n't allowed even to hear about them.  |p243Goudsmit  took that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tragedy of scientific life today that every group of specialists was walled off from all other groups . The tremendous discovery of atomic fission had been due to one single fact , the free circulation of ideas throughout the world . There had been little groups of learned people called theoretical physicists , men and a few women who dealt almost entirely with elaborate and complicated mathematical equations . There were others who tested these formulas in the laboratory , and if the tests succeeded the discovery would go out in scientific papers and often by telegraph to the other groups in all the lands . Each new idea was eagerly taken up , and hundreds of other minds worked over it day and night . But now the atomic physicists of every land were walled off as if they had been criminals , and their discoveries were jealously guarded as essential to national safety . No group knew what any other group was working on or what progress it had made . In his previous broadcast the physicist had warned against permittingGermany to become a pawn to be fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a year wiser and could say that it had happened . Germany was divided into two halves , and the Soviets were setting out to make the eastern half over in their image , while the other three Allies did the same with their half . Goudsmit was sure the Germans would never give up their demand for national unity ; but Lanny in the question period ventured to express doubt of this . He said that the modern techniques of propaganda constituted a new and revolutionary force and would do many things that had never been done in the world before . Each side would give its half of Germany what information it wished that half to possess . The newspapers , the radio , the books , and above all the schools , were being made over , and if that process was allowed to continue there would be two new generations of Germans , as different from each other as Germans were from Frenchmen or Poles . There had been a Thirty Years ' War in which Germans had fought Germans , and why might not the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for the Western nations to get Western ideas into the Soviet zone of Germanyby radio and any other means that could be devised . Monck wrote , " Things are coming to a head . You should be here to see it . " He added incidentally , " Ferdinand and the deaf French girl are watching each other carefully and making reports on each other ;  |p244they  are accurate , but not exactly what we wanted . " An odd situation indeed ! These two young people , falling in love with each other and at the same time religiously keeping the great secret ; each believing that the other was a secret member of the Nazi underground  --  or could it be that each believed the other to be a Red sympathizer ? It made Lanny think of the situation described to him as prevailing in the cafes on the Kurfiirstendamm , which were full of spies peering over one another 's shoulders and trying to sell one another their secrets . Boris Shub wrote , " You should see RIAS now ; you would hardly know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . I think the cold war will really be on soon . The Reds have called a German Writers ' Congress , to be held mostly in their sector Some of us are going to attend , and there may be fun .

Two of them have been repeated by request . " As it happened , one of Lanny 's wealthy art clients was planning to will his collection to the town in which he lived and make it an art center bearing his name . He had called Lanny 's attention to a gap in this collection ; he wanted a good and genuine Rembrandt , and could Lanny find it for him ? It was a good time to be picking up such treasures , because the American Army had collected and returned to their former owners some two hundred thousand works of art which had been stolen and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosenberg . Many of the former owners no longer had money to buy themselves food , to say nothing of paying taxes on their homes , and an offer of real American dollars would present them with a sore temptation . Lanny Budd had been for a quarter of a century what the Germans called a Kunstsachverstandiger , which means literally " an art-affairs understander " ; he understood how to find such temptable persons and how to tempt them . He knew of two Rembrandts in Europe that he had once tried to buy , and now he wrote letters and learned that changed circumstances had made them available . He submitted photographsand their histories to his client and was told that either or both would be acceptable , and the price to be offered was left to his judgment . Lanny himself proved to be temptable . He thought , If those great masterpieces were in America he could take Laurel to see them ! All he had to do was to telephone Turner of the Secret Service and his credentials would be mailed to him the same day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for his seat on the plane . For money he could go to the bank and make out a counter check . After that he had only to put his belongings into two light plastic suitcases and ask Freddi Robin to drive him to the airport . So easy had civilization made everything for its favored sons ! By now it had come about that a man could step into a plane on a Tuesday morning and pass his time comfortably reading , eating , and sleeping , and step out onto the Tempelhoferfeld on Wednesday afternoon . It was as if in the course of a hundred years the world had shrunk to the twentieth part of its former size . A great many people had been unable to adjust their minds to the fact of that shrinking . In the great marble building on a slight rise of ground in Washington , D. C. , were more than five hundred legislators charged with protecting the safety of the country , and a large percentage of these had apparentlyremained oblivious to the change . Now and then a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Japan , and this would be contemptuously described as a " junket " ; but to Lanny it seemed a worth-while expenditure of public funds , if only to make these gentlemenrealize how quickly an enemy could come the other way . Settled back in a comfortable seat a mile or two above the earth , Lanny read in one of the highbrow magazines a sentence spoken by an English statesman , Edmund Burke , something like a hundred and fifty years ago : " The arguments of tyranny are as contemptible as its force is dreadful . " Lanny stowed that sentence away in his memory , thinking that it might come in handy at a German Writers ' Congress to be held mostly in the Soviet sector of Berlin . And it did . The Congress was an elaborate propaganda stunt , carefully planned in Moscow and controlled by its military authorities . They were goingto assemble the well-known German writers from all the four zones , indoctrinate them with the dogmas of Soviet communism , and convince them that it was destined to dominate the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place under the official patronage of all the Four Powers . The sponsor bore the sober name of " The Association of German Authors , " a respected body founded before World War I , abolished by Hitler , and now brought to life again . The chairman was the honored woman novelist Ricarda Huch , now eighty-one years of age , and the honorary president was HeinrichMann . The main sessions were held in the Kammerspiele , in thep246Russian sector just around the corner from the headquarters of the Security Police on the Luisenstrasse ; they were being run by an Army colonel called the cultural commissar . The Americans had no such official and were paying no attention whatever to the enterprise . No American writers had been invited . The affair was in its second day when Lanny stepped off the airplane . He had barely time to arrive at the Savoy Hotel before Boris Shub called him up in a state of excitement . He wanted Lanny to come to his place to have dinner and hear about it , and Lanny did so . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had gone quite innocently to the afternoon session , expecting to hear discourses on the announced topics , " The Author and Spiritual Freedom " and " The Function of Literary Criticism . " But at that sessionColonel Dymschitz had presented a Soviet writer named Vishnevsky , editor of a Moscow magazine and author of a melodramatic Soviet film called We Are from Kronstadt . This gentleman , wearing his three rows of ribbons and decorations , had told the writers of Germanythat the United States was planning a war of aggression , but the Soviets knew how to deal with warmongers ; he had summoned the German writers and the German people to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Soviets against the American imperialists . His discourse con-tinued : " Reactionary forces in Washington and London are trying to create an iron curtain , ' but the Soviet nation is watchful and can not be frightened , not even by atomic bombs . . . . Brothers , comrades , we know how to answer . If you need us , call for our help and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communists , watched of course by their wizened little cultural commissar out of uniform . The German and American liberals had sat in stunned silence . They had left the hall debating what to do about it and had consulted with the chairman scheduled for the following morning , a German editor named Birkenfeld who happened to be more liberal than the Reds had realized . He had agreed that if an American writer would prepare a speech answering Vishnevsky , he would introduce that writer and give him a hearing . A volunteer had come forward , Melvin J. Lasky ; he had come out of New York 's intelligentsia , and while writing precocious historicalp247essays had earned his living by running the elevator in the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty . He had come to Germany as a soldier , and now was back as correspondent for the New Leader and the Partisan Review . His age was twenty-seven , and he was entirely unknown to the Germans ; it was presumptuous indeed for him to undertake such a task , but there was nobody else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his apartment , hammering away on a typewriter . They would have dinner and give him until the middle of the evening , and then go and help him translate his speech into acceptable German . So it was that Lanny first came to meet Melvin Lasky , who was to become a friend . He was a medium-sized fellow who wore a tiny reddishgoatee  --  something that intensely annoyed the opposition , since Bolshevik propriety required men to be smooth-shaven . He worked the night through on that speech , and Shub and Mrs. Birkenfeld and Lanny helped him until the small hours of the morning . At ten o'clock they were all seated in the second row of the theater . Leading Soviet novelists and playwrights , all decorated , occupied the front row . There was the embittered Vishnevsky , and there was Kataev , a playwright and novelist who had once written a satire on Russia'scrowded housing conditions that had been a hit on Broadway , but who was writing no satires now . There was Gorbatov , a Soviet writer whom Shub had met on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apologize for the dreadful treatment being meted out to the millions of Russians who had been seized by the German Army and were now being taken back and put at slave labor by the Kremlin . Also , of course , there was the cultural commissar , setting the pace for their applause . The correspondent Lasky was introduced , and he started tactfully and seductively . He congratulated the Congress upon " the spectacle of German authors again meeting freely together , critically exchangingideas and making plans to defend and extend their newly born liberties . " He waited while the Russian translator rattled off his words , and the Russians all applauded . He told how American writers had been stniggling for " honesty , frankness , and social realism in literature . " The Russians all nodded approval of that ; it was the Soviet formula . He went on like that for a while , and if he had stopped there he would have been hailed as a great writer . But among the examples of American wartime censorship he mentioned that we were " not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The edition had already been printed and distributed , but officials in Washington thought itp248might embarrass relations with Moscow . During that time many honest and independent books which were critical of the Soviet dictatorship , the Communist one-party system , the Soviet apparatus of political concentration camps and slave labor , were postponed and withheld ; but I am glad to say only postponed . They have all since been published . " Those , of course , were awful things to be said in the presence of Russian writers ; it was literally the first time such words had been spoken in Berlin , for Americans had been forbidden to criticize their Soviet allies . Looking squarely at the decorated Russians in the front row , Lasky continued , " We know how soul-crushing it is to work and write when behind us stands a political censor , and behind him stand the police . Think how it must shatter the nerves of a Russian writer to worry constantly whether the new party doctrine of the revised state formula of social realism , ' or formalism , ' or objectivism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mark only of a decadent counterrevolutionary tool of the Fascists . " The cultural commissar arose and stalked out and was followed by Kataev , the satirist who had stopped satirizing ten years ago . Other Communists in the audience began to interrupt . " Warmonger ! Throw him out ! What about Eisler ? " They shouted that again and again  --  referring to a Soviet secret agent who had been arrested in New York and was soon to jump bail and escape . But Lasky went on to finish his peroration about the function of the writer as a champion of liberty of the mind and spirit , and the opponent of every form of oppression . He included that sentence from Edmund Burke which Lanny had supplied : " The arguments of tyranny are as contemptible as its force is dreadful . " So it is that the thoughts of great men survive and re-echo down the ages . So it is that , in the words of Shelley , " Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of mankind . " The Reds hissed and booed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Lasky walked down the aisle people crowded around him and grasped his hand . The aged Ricarda Huch , whose good name the Soviets were trying to exploit , embraced him and thanked him warmly . Then , in the afternoon , when there was a Soviet chairman , the writer Kataev arose to fight for his cause . Said he , " I have acquainted myself with the speech of the so-called American writer , Lasky . I am very happy finally to have met a flesh-and-blood warmonger face to face.  |p249We  have no such specimens in the Soviet Union . This is a very instructivespectacle . I do n't know what books Lasky has written . I know other American writers , but Lasky is completely unknown to me . I believe that if Lasky should ever be immortalized through a monument , the grateful Americans will mark it with the inscription : Tomb of the Unknown Writer . ' . . . Today the decency of men is measured by their relation toward democracy and the Soviet Union . What the unknown Lasky has said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . Such lies are not new to us . Dr. Goebbels also used to resort to similar methods to incite against the Soviet Union . How that ended is known to all . " For weeks thereafter the reports of that literary duel continued to re-echo throughout the Soviet Union and its captive lands . It was a way by which suppression and oppression defeat themselves . In their fury the oppressors and the defenders of oppression fail to realize how they are making known the very facts they wish to suppress . The widely circulated Literary Gazette of Moscow devoted almost a full column to the affair , describing the scene in these terms : " The commotion in the hall increased . Outraged by the long speech of the guest , ' listeners demanded that the demagogue be removed . Amid outcries of This is unheard of ! He is abusing the privilege of a guest ! ' the swindler was forced to stop talking , to leave the scene , and soon thereafter to disappear from the auditorium . " But he did not disappear from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press in Berlin . They continued to heap insults upon him . They commented upon his beard , " a cheap Hollywood imitation of Trotsky . " They called him a warmonger and a Fascist . The cultural commissar published an attack of thirty-five hundred words , longer than Lasky 's speech ; he found the young man 's appearance " repulsive " and linked him with the atom bomb . The persons whom Lasky had been trying to impress were the young Berlin intellectuals , and among them there developed a sort of Lasky cult  --  they even went so far as to adopt his notorious goatee . For , in the words of Boris Shub , he had told young Berlin what young Berlin had been waiting to hear . He had cut through the sham humanitarian pretense of the Communist cultural front . He had spoken the truth , as " the woman on the pedestal " understood it . Shub was alluding to that odd occupation by which the unknown writer had been earning his living on Bedloe 's Island in New York harbor . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three weeks after the affair General Clay authorizedp250his director of the Information Control Division " to attack communismin every form wherever it exists , and to cite each exposed exampleof its day-to-day work . " So came that change for which Lanny had pleaded with Undersecretary of State Acheson ; it became known among the Americans as Operation Back-Talk . One of its developmentswas the publication of a monthly magazine , dignified , cultural , and literary , in the German language . Its title was Der Monat , and the unknown writer Melvin J. Lasky became its editor . Bernhardt Monck had no time to attend congress sessions , but Lanny told him about the affair , and he in turn imparted the latest evidence dug up by the Katyn investigation and the developments in the affairs of the Volkischerbund . Kurt Meissner was still in East Berlin and apparentlymeant to stay there ; he was working actively to keep what he called the German spirit alive . He had insisted that Fritz should go on with his studies . The deaf French girl  --  they smiled over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance of one of the Bund , a man named Hans Schufurt , and was sending information ; she did n't say how she was getting it , but so far it agreed with information from other sources . Heinrich Brinkmann , who was the leader of the crowd , had gone to Hungary . They had a printing press there , so probably Brinkmann had taken the plates . This business of spying was like groping in the dark ; every now and then your fingers touched something . You were n't able to feel all around it , you had just a tiny contact and you had to guess what it was , and how to fit it into the rest of the environment which you had touched . It was a dangerous environment ; you were apt to touch something with a sharp steel point , or something very hot , perhaps a high-tension wire . Lanny asked about Fritz and the girl , and Monck said that apparentlyneither had discovered that the other was a spy . They were separated now , and Monck had n't questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaken the suspicion in Fritz 's mind that Monck had ever known or heard of Anna Surden . Perhaps Fritz might choose to confide in Lanny , and this might be important in throwing light on both of them . Monck , who had a secret way of communicating with Fritz , made an appointment , and the lad came to Lanny 's hotel room , after takingp251precautions to make sure he was not being followed . His happiness at seeing his admired American friend was touching ; he was having a lonely time of it , he said , and was in need of encouragement . Both he and his father were living in the presence of danger . Fritz was posing among his fellow students as a secret Nazi sympathizer , and more than one of these had disappeared from the college ; the Communist secret police had come to their lodging in the small hours of the morning and carried them away . As for Kurt , he was posing as a Communist sympathizer and trying to get the Communists to let his music be published , while at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans ; he was gettingfunds from sources about which he never spoke , not even to his son . The mother was taking care of six children who were going to a school run by a Communist supervisor . The mother had only one old woman to help her , and she had no idea what either her husband or her oldest son was doing . Lanny listened to the details of this pictureand got a new realization of the state of tension in which these onetime German provinces were caught . Soviet communism , American capitalism , German National Socialism , and old-style Russian and Germannationalisms  --  it was like half a dozen tornadoes tearing a house to pieces . " What 's this I hear about your having a girl ? " demanded Lanny . " Oh , Herr Budd , I am embarrassed about it ! My conscience troublesme . I thought I saw a chance of happiness , but , of course , it could n't be . Nobody can be happy in these times . " " Who is the girl ? " " Her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly knew her . She came back looking for her family . They were all gone , not a trace of them ! She came to me to ask if I knew what had become of them , and so we had a talk . She was lonely and I was lonely  --  and you know how it is . " " I know how it is , " Lanny said , helping out . " Were n't you afraid of getting her into trouble ? " " I took precautions . " " Were n't you afraid she might find out what you were doing and talk about you ? " " She has no interest in politics , Herr Budd . I made sure about that . I do n't think she knows anything about such questions . She was just a lonely , frightened girl and interested only in being loved . " " Did n't she ask you questions about what you were doing , how you were earning a living , and so on ? " 252 THE RETURN OF LANNY BUDD " She did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking care of me , and that I was studying hard , even on vacation . " " Did n't she ask about your father ? " " Sometimes , naturally , because he is a famous man and everybody wants to know about him . But I assure you I did n't say a word that could make any difference . " " Where is she now ? " " She is staying on in Wendefurth because she has no other place to go , Herr Budd . She wanted somebody to take care of her , and wanted to get some kind of work . She had a little money that she had earned . Then I had to come back to school ; my father insisted upon it , and I could n't refuse to obey . So I left the girl very sad . " " She writes to you ? " " Yes , but I try not to think about her because I have a job to do . How can I think of marriage in my position ? She says she will wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nor could Lanny give encouragement to Fritz . He thought of the man named Hans Schufurt , from whom Anna was getting information . Knowing Nazi men , Lanny was sure she would n't get much from him by remaining true to Fritz . There just was n't any place for either love or marriage within the sweep of those tornadoes . Only one thing Lanny could say to hearten the lad ; he could renew that promise he had made to see to it that no punishment should be meted out to Kurt as a result of what Fritz had reported to AMG . It was the gang that the Americans were after , and not a crippled musician . XIThe two Rembrandts which Lanny had come to inspect complementedeach other in a curious and dramatic way . They were both portraits of the artist : one representing him as a youth , bright-cheeked and smiling , jaunty and with a feather in his hat ; the other showing him as an old man , careworn and infinitely melancholy . The face was somewhat bloated ; drink had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world that this old man had managed his affairs very ill . His work , which the world now esteemed so highly , had pleased his patrons little ; his fame had declined , and failure was written upon his features . To hang those two paintings side by side in an art museum would be to move the soul of every visitor , and preach a sermon concerning a painter 's life and times . The latter of these works was in a Schloss near Hannover , in thep253British zone . Lanny would have liked to rent a car and travel by the autobahn , but he was told that the Reds had purposely let it deteriorate and it was badly pitted . They made all kinds of delays and trouble about the necessary permits ; they were following a policy of pinpricks to discourage British , French , and American travel . So it was cheaper and quicker to be flown , and Lanny would require only British papers , which had already been provided by Washington . In the bombed-out city of Hannover , now being slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a country estate to meet a wealthy steel man from whom he had offered to buy the same Rembrandt some twenty years ago , but in vain . Now the world had changed , and the steel man with it . Then he had been as well stuffed as a German Wurst , but now he was thin and frail looking ; his hair was white and scanty , his face was lined , and his hands trembled so that he kept them on his knees while he talked . Yes , he was willing to sell the painting , but only for a high price , because it was the last of his treasures . It was a wonderfulwork , a famous work , and surely it had not deteriorated in value . " Look at it , Herr Budd , and make sure it is what I claim it to be . " Lanny , having previously investigated it , needed only to make sure that it was the same painting . How much did Herr Schlesinger want for it ? So began an agony of soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanny said quietly that he never made offers . He had not come to haggle ; the owner set the price , and if Lanny thought it was reasonable the money would be forthcoming in American dollars . If not , he had another Rembrandt in view in Paris and would travel there . " Ach , ja , " said Herr Schlesinger . " I think I know the one you mean , but that is a painting of the artist as a young man . This one is full of character , of spiritual meaning . " " To be sure , " said Lanny , " but the general public is n't spiritual . It is interested in youth and in pretty things . " Herr Schlesinger became eloquent . He talked of how scarce Rembrandtshad come to be  --  most of them were in museums and could n't be purchased for any price . This one was peerless , it was really priceless ; it deserved many adjectives and received them . Lanny was patient ; he knew this was the bargaining process , and politeness required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to controvert any of the statements , for that would have been haggling , and he was taking an aloof and magnificent position . Herr Schlesinger said he had expected Lanny to make an offer , and in the effort to strengthen his own nerves , or perhaps to weakenp254Lanny 's , he ordered Kaffee and Kuchen . But Lanny did n't weaken , and in the end the aging man blurted out that he wanted two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for the painting . He probably expected to hear Lanny say that it was too much , and Lanny said it , and was very polite in regretting that he could n't advise his client to pay that sum . Lanny arose and prepared to take his departure . No sooner had he got up out of his chair than Herr Schlesinger said two hundred and ten thousand , and by the time Lanny got to the door he had come down to two hundred thousand . Then he followed out to the car and pleaded with the expert , almost but not quite with tears . What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it and said he never broke his rule ; he said that all Herr Schlesinger had to do was to name the lowest price that he would be willing to accept , and if Lanny thought he could do so in justice to his client he would say yes . The trembling old man , seeing Lanny opening the door of his car , said a hundred and seventyfivethousand ; and Lanny said , All right , he could advise his client to pay that . They went back into the house , and papers were made out and signed . Lanny had had four hundred thousand dollars put at his disposalin a London bank , and he now made out a draft for a hundred and seventy-five thousand in Herr Schlesinger 's favor ; at Lanny 's suggestionHerr Schlesinger went to the telephone and called the London bank and got the assurance that the draft would be honored . Then the old man rang for one of his servants , and Lanny saw the painting taken down from the wall and put into his car . He bade good-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-by to his treasure , joy and sorrow mixed in his heart . The purchaser drove into the city and found a box factory where he could have the treasure wrapped and sewed up in canvas and waterproofcloth and then boxed beyond possibility of damage . It was eveningby the time all that was done , and he had the precious box transported to his hotel and carried up to his room . He would n't leave it alone for a minute : he had dinner brought up to him and spent the evening stretched out on the bed , reading the sprightly sad letters of Jane Welsh Carlyle . In the morning the treasure was carried down and transported to the office of the American Express Company , which was again doing busi/ness in Western Germany . He had it shipped to New York , insured for its full value . That cost a lot of money , but the client had it . Lanny sent him a cablegram , and by airmail an accounting of the whole procedure . This having been done , the art expert was entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London and put it in his personal account . Then he was flown back to Berlin , still with Jane keeping him company . He liked her very much and thought he could have done better than Thomas , her crochety husband . He wondered if the General Graf Stubendorf had got through reading the husband 's five volumes about Frederick the Great . WHEN Lanny got back to Berlin he found a note at his hotel to call Braun ; that was Monck . He called , and Monck said , " I 'll come right over . " In Lanny 's room , with the door closed , he stated , " Bad news for both of us ; Ferdinand has been arrested . " Monck did n't trust himself to say the boy 's real name even in a hotel room , because servants in hotels can be bribed and rooms can be secretly wired . " Oh no ! " Lanny exclaimed . " Three men came to the room he shares with several other fellows . One of them pointed him out , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . " " Soviet men ? " " MGB agents undoubtedly . They are the secret police in the East sector . " " Would that be on our account ? " Monck 's answer was , " Let 's take a walk . " So they went downstairs separately and met outside and walked along obscure streets , making sure they were not being followed . " I 've been trying to figure it out , " Monck said . " It 's a complicatedp256matter . The boy was supposed to be a Nazi sympathizer posing as a Red . He had confided to some of his friends that he was a Nazi , so the most likely thing is that they took him for that reason . But they will put him through their ordeal and make him tell all he knows . " " Do you think he will talk about us ? " " They will reduce his mind to such a pulp he will be like a man talking in a trance or in a dream . He wo n't know what he 's saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said . " " Oh , Monck , how perfectly horrible ! Is there nothing we can do about it ? " " Not a thing in this world . He 's a Soviet subject by conquest , and he 's in the Soviet Union to all intents and purposes . If we said a word about him we 'd simply be revealing that we are interested in him , and they 'd set to work to find out why . We could n't do him a greater disservice . " " And we do n't know how long we 'll have to wait ! " " I know men who were arrested by the Nazis , and their families had to wait ten years . The same men were taken by the Reds , and some of the families are still waiting . " " It makes me sick to think about it , " Lanny said . He looked about him . There was a pile of bricks in front of a wrecked building , and he sat on it for a minute or two to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew how his friend felt . A man needed a tough hide to live in this new-old Europe . But Lanny Budd had not been able to grow that hide . When they were walking again the German gave his professional view of the situation . " If they think he is a Nazi it may not be so bad for him . They do n't mind that so much now because the Nazis are licked . They may make him a proposition to work for them . If so , we may hear from him soon . " " I lc wo n't sell us out , that I am sure of , " declared Lanny . " I lc 'd become a double agent . It may be they 'll set him to work on his father , without knowing that he 's already doing it . That would be a new one even to me ! " " Oh , that poor boy ! " Lanny exclaimed . " I 'll never be able to forgive myself ! " " Do n't start getting neurotic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are in a war , and you have seen men die . This boy knew what he was getting into , and he 's done us a real service in tracing the counter/feiters to Hungary . Even if he had never met you he was n't going to be safe ; he was n't going to be safe if he followed his father , and he was n't going to be safe if he turned against his father . " " I know all that , " Lanny said . " I warned him of the danger . " " We all warned him , and he went in with his eyes open . It 's happeningall the time ; just a short time ago the Reds took away half a dozen students from the university . It caused an uproar , but the Reds do n't mind that  --  they want to frighten the rest , including the faculty . They come over into our sector and arrest Germans and carry them off at night , and we do n't know about it unless somebody hears a disturbance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could name , and in every case they denied that they ever heard of them . We do n't get them back unless we are able to get exact information as to who they are , where they are , and who arrested them . " " I 've heard those stories , " Lanny said . " But this is the first time it 's been anyone I know . " " I cautioned you , " Monck went on , " and now I want to make it emphatic . You have to learn what I 've learned , and do n't go out on the street at night without company . You 're known as a RIAS man now , and there 's nobody they hate more . You went over to that Writers ' Congress , you 're known to be Lasky 's friend , and now comes this business of Ferdinand . The kid may name us , or they may already know about us , and they 'll tell him what to say about us and he 'll say it , believe me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked man ; and I want you to promise that if anyone lays hands on you , you wo n't have any dignity about it , but scream like a wildcat . Make all the noise you can , and shout your name over and over again . That 's your only chance , that somebody may hear your name and take the trouble to go to a telephone and call up AMG . It happens that way often , and then we start raising hell and the Reds have to give up . " " All right , " Lanny promised . He could n't help being amused by the image of himself screaming like a wildcat . But his smile died as he thought again of that blue-eyed , pink-cheeked German boy screaming . They would take him into some cellar where his screams would not be heard ; they had rooms built especially for that purpose . They had all the torture devices that the Nazis had used , and new ones contrived by their own scientists . Lanny had known about the Nazis ' from the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the sights  --  just for the hell of it . " You 're too softhearted , " Monck said , knowing Lanny of old . " A man has no business coming to this part of the world unless he 's grownp258callous . We just have to write that boy off and look for another agent . If he comes back , it 's that much to the good  --  unless his nerves are so shot he ca n't work any more . " " I hope you got everything he had , " replied Lanny , trying to take his old colleague 's advice . " I 'll never be sure about that . He may have had papers on him , and that would be bad . " " Poor Kurt ! " exclaimed Lanny . " I suppose he has heard about it . " " What I 'm thinking about , " was the reply , " is where I can find somebody else that can get next to Kurt Meissner . That surely sets us a problem . " " That 's one place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said it and he meant it ; but you never could tell in this strange business . He went back to his hotel , and sitting there in the lobby was a tall , long-faced German . Of all the unlikely persons in all the four zones of that conquered land  --  Kurt Meissner ! He looked older , poorer , and more beaten than Lanny had ever seen him , or ever expected to . His face was almost gray ; and Lanny thought in a flash , He knows ! It would n't do for Lanny to know , of course , so he said cheerfully , " Why , Kurt ! Hello ! What brings you here ? "  --  as if he could have no idea that Kurt had come there to see him . " I want to speak to you , " said Kurt quietly . " I have come to tell you  --  they have taken my oldest boy , Fritz . " " The Reds ? " " Yes . They came to his room and took him away . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not find out . I have been to the police , I have been to the military , and they say they know nothing about it . They give me surly looks ; it is an impertinence for me to come and ask . I am a German dog . " " Tell me , what were the boy 's activities ? What were his ideas ? " " He was a loyal German , naturally . But I warned him that if we were going to live in the East zone we must accommodate ourselves to the regime ; we must make it plain that we were nonpolitical , that we were obeying the laws . You understand , a certain amount of camouflagewas necessary . " " I understand well . "  | " But the boy was impetuous . He was young and inexperienced . No doubt he told some of his comrades that he was a Nazi sympathizer , as his father had been in the old days ; and no doubt the Reds had spies among the students . " " You remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I was stubborn when I should have heeded you . I see now that I can not live in the East zone . I think of how they will torture my boy ; they may break him down , and the next time they may come for me . When I went into that MGB building I knew that I might not come out again . I am not thinking of myself  --  life no longer holds anything for me ; I am a wreck , a beaten man . But I have to think of Elsa and the children and what will become of them . " " Have you told Elsa ? " Lanny asked . " Elsa is in Wendefurth , and I have not written her . I can not bear to do it . She will go out of her mind . She adores the boy . " " It 's a terrible thing to think of , Kurt . " Lanny could share the grief for the fate of the son , but there were limits to his sympathy for the father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicted upon them by the Nazis  --  literally millions of people . Kurt had known about it and had managed to endure it without grief . But now the tables were turned ; he was the conquered instead of the conqueror . Vae victis ! had been the motto of the ancient Romans ; they had been a stern people . " You remember the boy , Lanny ? " demanded Kurt . " I remember him well , of course ; a fair-haired lad with blue eyes . He was tall for his age . " " He is as tall as you are now . He is sound , and I have trained him to be a decent man . But how he will stand up under the torture I can not be sure . " " There is no use torturing yourself , Kurt . It may not turn out to be as bad as you fear . They may let him go after a while . " " I think it unlikely . They are determined to root out every trace of the Fiihrer 's teachings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have been doing nothing they could object to , but they may choose to believe otherwise ; and they have ways of making a man confess . " Something inside Lanny was saying , " So you know about those ways ! " A curious kind of satisfaction , to watch a Nazi taking a dose of his own medicine and making a face over it . But it was not a generous feeling , and Lanny put it aside . " You must think about the rest of your family , Kurt . "  | " That is why I came to you . You offered to help me get into the American zone . Are you still willing to do it ? " " I will do my best , as I promised . Can Elsa get a permit to bring the children to Berlin ? " " I think so . It would be natural for my family to wish to join me , and once they 're in East Berlin they can cross into the American sector . The only question is , would they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pretty surely mean Siberia . " " I 'd be glad to save those children from having to be brought up by the Reds , " said Lanny . " But you must understand , Kurt ; when I talk to the military people they will want to know what your attitude is going to be . They do n't want to import any more Neo-Nazis into their zone . " " I pledge my word , Lanny , " said his old friend solemnly . " I am an absolutely nonpolitical person . I accept the fact that the **25;6737;TOOLONG is dead and that Germany is to be a democratic land . " The German was looking the American straight in the eye as he said this , and it gave Lanny something of a qualm . He knew that the Nazis had lied on principle , exactly as the Communists were doing now ; Lanny , as a spy , had lied to Kurt and had taken it for granted that Kurt , as a spy , would lie to him . But this was something more personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . Lanny showed no doubt . He said quietly , " All right , Kurt , I will see what can be done . You must n't be surprised if there is delay , because our Refugee Commission has its hands full . Meantime , if I were you I would keep away from the Reds as much as possible . Have you thought where you wish to live in the American zone ? " The reply was , " I should like to be near the General Graf Stubendorf . " Kurt always referred to him in that formal manner ; never without his titles , as Lanny would do . " He is living by the Tegernsee , and I have thought of writing to him but was afraid my mail might be opened . " Lanny saw that he had to tell of his visit to the Graf . Then he added , " He is living very humbly . " " I know , but that is because he is an old man and needs attendance and quiet . But I believe he has another cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are you going to need money ? " " Thank you , Lanny , I have some saved up . You do not have to bother about that . "  |p261Lanny  kept his smile to himself . Little did Kurt guess how much worrying Lanny had been doing on the subject of Kurt 's money ! They parted , and Lanny went at once to the genial Mr. Morrison of the Treasury . That official was professionally grieved over the loss of a good spy , but needless to say he had no grief over the spy 's father . " It is a question of balancing gains against losses , " was his conclusion . " Kurt and his mob are dangerous characters ; on the other hand , if we have them in our zone we can watch them more closely . There are always anti-Nazis who are willing to watch Nazis , especially when they get paid for it . And if Kurt or his fellows bring their phony money to the Tegernsee we 'll be in position to grab it , and them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bavaria , " Lanny pointed out , " because it is a Catholic land and a great many people who were forced to call themselves Nazis were really not that at heart . " " Quite so , " assented the other . " Tell me about Stubendorf ; could we expect anything from him ? " " I would hate to promise it , " Lanny said . " He was a Wehrmacht general and a Nazi only pro forma . But he regards Kurt as one of his people , a genius of his raising and fostering . The old man is a Prussianaristocrat and looks forward to the return of his class to their onetime glory . " " Tell me , " said Morrison , " did Fritz say anything to you about buried treasure ? " " I do n't recall that he did . " " He told us he believed his father had knowledge of some of the Nazi caches . No doubt you know that they had great stores of gold and jewels . When the time came for them to scatter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thought were safe . We have turned up several lots and we 're on the trail of more . That may possibly be where Kurt gets his living expenses . " " I would doubt that , " Lanny said . " He is a man of honor according to his own notions , and he would consider that state treasure . He would feel free to use it to promote the work of the Volkischerbund , but not for his family expenses . " " Yet he would use the proceeds of the counterfeiting work ? " " That would be different from his point of view . That is Britishand American money , and putting it off on us would be an act of war . " " Even though it was Germans who bought the money ? "  |p262Lanny  laughed . " Those Germans would be trading with the enemy , and at their own risk . The ultimate effect would be to dilute the currencyof the enemy lands and weaken their economies . Bear in mind that Kurt has never surrendered ; he has just gone underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Morrison . " I 'll take the matter up with the Refugee Commission at once . " " They will grant the request ? " " I am sure they will . They have n't planes enough to fly all the refugees who want to get out of Berlin into West Germany , and they have n't places enough to put them in ; but when we make a request it is for a special reason , and they do us the honor to suppose that we know our business . " " So I can tell Kurt that the thing will go through ? " " You may . Tell him to get his family out as quickly as possible . " " I have already done that , " Lanny said . " We have arranged a code . I 'm to write him that the music scores are available . " " And do n't sign your name , " advised Morrison . " I will sign it Bienvenu , ' the name of my mother 's home on the French Riviera where he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the hope that someday he may come back and be the great musician and decent man that I used to know . " Lanny did n't wait to learn the outcome of Operation Meissner ; there was nothing more for him to do about it , and Morrison promised to keep him informed . Monck made the same promise ; also he gave Lanny a letter to Irving Brown , the representative of the American Federation of Labor in Paris , who would be able to put Lanny in touch with . the crucial events going on there . Lanny took a plane one morning and was set down on the Orly Airfield . He took a taxi to the elegant Hotel Crillon , which had been the headquarters of his father on business trips , and for Lanny a sort of second home from childhood on . The price of room and bath , he was told , would now be twenty-five hundred francs per day ; but this did not alarm him , for he knew that the franc stood at eighty-four onehundredthsof a cent . Lanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stood five to the dollar ; it had begun sliding during World War I , and the end was not yet . Currency inflation is to the government what an anesthetic is to the surgeon ; it provides an easyp263and painless way of separating the rich from their savings and reducing the wages of all employed persons in the community . Lanny 's first action was to go to the writing room of the hotel and compose a note on its impressive stationery to the Marquis de la Tour de Brielle , informing that gentleman that Mr. Lanning Prescott Budd had the pleasure to announce his arrival in Paris and his readiness to inspect the Rembrandt painting . He addressed that note to the nobleman'stown house in the St.-Germain district , where the old aristocracylived their ineffably dignified lives . Crude Americans were not often admitted to those homes ; but it was sometimes a problem to keep the wolf from the door , and an American dollar was worth a hundred and nineteen francs officially and more on the black market . Having posted the letter , Lanny knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There would be no possibility of a telephone call from the marquis , for that gentleman 's code of etiquette had been established at least two centuries before the telephone was thought of . But Lanny knew some modern-minded Frenchmen ; one of them was Captain Denis de Bruyne , who lived in the Seine-et-Oise district outside Paris . Lanny had not seen him for more than a year . When he heard Lanny 's voice he exclaimed in delight , " I will come right in for you . " The traveler had time to lay out his belongings and get Edgemere , New Jersey , on the telephone . He told Laurel where he was and how he was , and heard that the family was thriving , and what speakers they were getting for the program , and what there was important and interestingin the mail . " Take care of yourself , " pleaded Laurel , and he promised . There was no need for him to make the same request , for she always did . Le capitaine had been Denis fils , or junior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black band around his arm for his father , who had died early in the year . Presumably the old man had found lodgment in some paradise full of virgins , for besides being an efficient businessman he had been the most elegant and cultivated of roues . Thereby he had forfeited the regard of his wife , and his loss had been Lanny 's gain , for Marie de Bruyne had been Lanny 's adored arie for a matter of ten years or so . This , according to French custom , had made him a sort of member of the family ; when Marie died the husband and the two sons and the lover all attended the funeral together , and no one found any impropriety in the event.  |p264Those  two sons had grown up with Lanny as a sort of second father , by the mother 's special appointment . The younger , Chariot , had been shot by the Vichy gangsters toward the end of the war . Denis had been twice wounded in fighting the Germans and his health was not so good , he reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children to a new home , so Denis and his family had the chateau , as it was called , though it was no more than an old brick villa with a lovely and well-tended garden . Denis insisted that Lanny should come out for the night . He had promised Annette , his wife , who knew that Lanny had helped to save their family from the partisans and so would roll out the red carpet for him . Lanny repacked one of his bags and went out to Denis 's car , whose chauffeur he greeted as an old friend . They drove in a rainstormthrough the traffic of Paris  --  traffic of which Laurel had remarked that it was carried on by homicidal maniacs . But they escaped alive , and out into the countryside which was beautiful even in November rain . They came through the village and along a country road , passing a spot that Lanny remembered from exactly a quarter of a century ago  --  where Marie de Bruyne had come walking and had stepped into his car and been carried away on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which Lanny had walked three years ago , after the Americans had landed in France , but while this countryside was still under German occupation . He had come secretly in the night to warn the father to come over to the Allied side before it was too late . The children were at boarding school , so there were only Annette and her elderly mother : a different kind of vie trois , for the head of this family was a strictly moral man , perhaps in reaction to his father 's ways , which he had known about since boyhood . All three of the family spoke English almost as well as French , and they had been reading the little Peace paper which Lanny sent them . They had occasionallybeen able to get the broadcasts by short wave , so they knew Lanny 's mind  --  all but the secret part , and they could make guesses about that . He told them what he had seen and learned in Berlin . He had a plausible reason for having been there , that he was a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business was bad and picking up but slowly . The rebuilding of France would be a long and painful process . He hadp265inherited a block of Budd-Erling Aircraft stock , and a large amount of dividends had accumulated through the war . There were no dividendscoming now , but Lanny made the guess that it would n't be long before the company would be active again . To his surprise Denis declaredthat he had no interest in this ; neither he nor his family wanted America or any other country to do any more fighting or to get ready for it . When Lanny expressed the opinion that this would mean surrenderingto the Communists , Denis said he did n't care ; France had shed all the blood she could spare if she was to survive . The French were war-weary , blood-sick , and wanted no more of it . This was an Army officer who had fought gallantly and had been promoted for it . He had fought the Germans both in North Africa and in France , and he said he himself would be willing to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the French people and was sure they would not fight again . They knew well that in another war the Russian artillery and tanks would roll over them and thousands of planes would knock their fliers out of the sky . They would be beaten again and occupied again , and it was no comfort to hear that the Americans would come once more to deliver them . In a war that would be fought with atomic bombs there would be nothing left to deliver . The French , a practical-minded people , would surrender and take whatever came to them . When Lanny expostulated and talked about the soul of Marianne , Denis explained what had happened to that soul . All the courage and idealism that the French possessed had gone into the magatis , which is the French word for the underbrush , the bush . The young men had hidden there and trained themselves and got ready for the day when Eisenhower told them to come out and destroy German communicationsand supplies . Most ardent among these fighters had been the Communists , and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was all there was to it . The moment the war ended these men had gone back into the factories and with the same spirit had won over the French workers to their cause . Now all the big French unions were Communist-controlled ; they could strike France at any time and have their way . They were on the verge of calling such a strike , said Denis ; it might come any day , and who could put it down ? And even if it were put down , the Reds would only gather new forces and try again . How could France , how could any country , be restored under such circumstances ? Foreseeing all this , Denis had left his American dividends in the First National Bank of Newcastle . He had sold a part of the familyp266business and had hidden away the family jewels and other treasures . At a moment 's notice they could be stowed in the car ; he was even thinking about taking the boys out of boarding school so as to have them at hand . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the servants , and all of them would take the highway to Bordeaux and from there to San Sebastian in Spain . They might end up in Californiaor the Argentine , they had not made up their minds which . Such was the state of mind of a wealthy French bourgeois ; and there sat his wife with grief and fear written on her features . Annette had been through so many perils she wanted no more . She was conservative-minded , as Lanny knew ; she favored " Big Charlie , " General de Gaulle , who wanted to come in and really put down the Reds . But what could even he do in the face of a general strike ? He could n't get political power , because the French voted for a dozen different parties ; the politicians could n't agree and spent their time quarreling and intriguing . France had a new government every three or four months , but the more it changed the more it was the same thing . In short , " La patrie est finie , " said the de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning ; and there he called at the office of the American Federation of Labor and presented his letter of introduction to Irving Brown . At first thought it might seem peculiar that this Federation should have a Paris office ; the reactionariesat home charged that what Brown was doing was illegal  --  he was carrying on a branch of international diplomacy supposed to be reserved to the United States government . But so far nobody had arrested this keen-witted labor diplomatist ; the Communists had threatened to kill him , but he was still alive and lively . He was young for the job , only thirty-six , and had been a New York University athlete . He had gone in for labor affairs and had become an organizer of the United Automobile Workers . Then the New Deal had taken him up and made him into a labor bureaucrat , and now he was on the payroll of America 's oldest and strongest labor group . He had been in Europe for a year or more , working at the job of trying to keep labor from falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business to know the old-time leaders among the Syndicalists , the Socialists , and the nonpartisan trade unions ; to explain America to them , to convince them that the Marshall Plan was not American imperialism but American friendship as manifested in thep267recent war . The motto of the French Revolution had been " Liberte , egalite , fraternity . " Brown pointed out that liberty had been placed first , and that equality and fraternity were impossible without it . It was a job that called for tact and patience , to say nothing of courage ; for the " Cocos , " powerful in France and on the verge of a stroke for mastery , poured out the vials of their fury upon this insolentYankee intruder . They called him " this agent of Wall Street , " " this corrupt spy of the Americans . " They called him " the gray eminence of the yellow International . " They doctored his photographs and then called him " Scarface . " They said he had a million dollars at his disposal and shouted for his expulsion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no scars on it . He was glad to see Lanny Budd , having heard some of the Peace programs . He was glad to sit down and hear the story of the progress of RIAS and its hopes . He was delighted to hear of Lanny 's talk with UndersecretaryAcheson . He himself had been to HQ and had had hot argumentswith General Clay and other AMG officials . It was a slow process of waking them up from their delusion of friendship , or even the expectation of common decency from the Reds . Our diplomats watched their multiple aggressions , sent them nothing but polite protests , and got nothing back but insults . By their use of the veto the Soviets were reducing the UN to futility ; there had once been three vetoes on a single day . The Social Democrats of Western Germany , our natural allies , had been reduced almost to impotence by the policy of AMG , which had once proposed the policy of threatening Kurt Schumacher with imprisonment because he would not cease his exposureof Communist brutalities . Fortunately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British Labour Cabinet consenting to the jailing of a German Socialist leader for criticizing Soviet world aggression ! Said Irving Brown , " I suppose the General 's orders come from Washington . The policy is called neutrality ' ; but I tell him there can be no neutrality in the fight between tyranny and freedom . And that 's what we have on our hands . " Lanny arrived in a taxicab at an old mansion in the St.-Germain quarter , hidden behind heavy shrubbery and a steel fence . The gates had been opened , and his ring was answered by an elderly black-clad servant . He gave his name , and there came an elderly woman , presum/ably the secretary , or possibly a poor relation . The marquis himself did not choose to be visible . In the old days Lanny had met some of these very stiff and dull aristocrats , but this was not a social occasion ; he had declassed himself by coming as a tradesman , a speculator , buying an illustrious name and turning great art into commerce . The elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the heavy curtains , enough so that Lanny could see the " Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , " where it had hung on the wall for perhaps a hundred years . Lanny had seen the photograph and knew the history of the work . He had brought along an electric torch and a small magnifying glass so that he could verify the signature and the brush strokes which were so characteristic . When he had satisfied him-selfhe asked the price of the painting and was told it was eleven millionfrancs . That was high , almost two hundred thousand dollars , but Lanny knew that his client wanted the painting . It was a perfect companion to the one that had just been bought in Germany ; and , of course , if he stopped to haggle there was always a chance that some dealer might step in and ask for time to find another customer . Lanny said , " I will take the painting . " He sat down at a spindly legged gold table of the Louis Quinze era and wrote his check for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marquis to sign . In order to spare that elderly gentleman an agony of uncertainty he specified that he would not come for the painting until the check had been cleared . He might have suggested that the marquis telephone the London bank , but he was n't sure there would be a telephone in this mansion , or that the marquis would consent to spend money so recklessly . It was easier for Lanny to go out and telephone the bank , requesting them to send an airmail letter to the marquis , attesting to the fact that the money was on deposit and the check good . No coffee and cake were served on this occasion . The elderly woman no doubt was secretly awed by seeing a human being write a check for eleven million francs , but she would give no sign of this . She was stiff and proper , sharing in the dignity of an august family , as proud of her marquis as any old-time Negro slave of his " old mahster . " As it turned out , there was no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting out of France . The general strike was called the following morning ; it had been prepared as carefully as a military campaign , and the hour had been kept secret . Now the word went out ,  | ; Ind some three million workers in the great industries of France , includingrailroads and shipping , laid down their tools and walked out to listen to Communist orators in meeting halls or on street corners near the places of work . This Communist-led strike was nominally for higher wages ; it was a protest against the rise in the cost of living  --  or , viewing it from the other side , against the depreciation of the franc . But it is hard for men to fly into a rage against an abstract thing such as inflation ; they have to have an enemy to blame it on , and in this case the enemy was Wall Street , the American imperialists who were trying to harness France to their chariot wheels by a cunning device called the Marshall Plan . General Marshall , in his role as American Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . There were a million members of the Communist party of France , and that meant a million men and women to make speeches in meeting halls and on street corners ; to lift their clenched left fists and scream , " A has l'imperialisme americain , a has le plan Marshall ! " In the nationalelections , held the previous year , the Communists had polled twenty-nine per cent of the total vote , which meant five million French men and women would gather in crowds and listen to the speakers and repeat the carefully contrived slogans . It meant parades in the streets , with banners and menacing signs . When properly worked up the mobs would get out of hand , and bricks would be thrown through plate-glass windows and the contents of shops looted . It meant a solid mass of men and women marching across a great bridge of the River Seine and besieging the Palais Bourbon where the National Assembly met , stormingthe legislative chamber and demanding the repeal of agreements for the Marshall Plan bribery of la belle France . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trained saboteurs , who had learned the arts of destruction in secret war upon the Nazis , turning their efforts against the American imperialists and their dupes and hirelings ; it meant the goods on the docks being dumped into the water , and railroad ties being torn up and bridges wrecked to prevent the bringing of Marshall Plan goods into France . It meant munitions being blown up and oil depots set on fire . It meant all these actions , not secretly but as an avowed public program . It meant women pleading with the police to refuse to disperse the mobs and with soldiers not to fire . As the final goal it meant a Communist revolution in France ; the seizure of strategic places , the radio stations and the newspapers , the telephone and telegraph offices , the arsenals , and ultimately the government itself . It meant Moscow in Paris.  |p270Lanny  attended one of the reunions , as they were called , on the second night of the strike . It was a somewhat dangerous thing for him to do , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minions , perhaps one of its bosses . He had signed a check for eleven million francs on the previous day , and that was as much as all the people in this hall might together be able to earn in a month . Many dark looks were cast at him ; but he sat quietly , and when the others applauded he clapped his hands , and when the clenched fists were raised his went up too . So they let him alone ; he might , for all they could know , be one of those eccentric American members of the haute bourgeoisie who turned Communist and gave of their millions to the cause of the awakening proletariat . He wanted to hear what was being said and wanted to observe , if not to share , the spirit of the French workers . In two hours he heard more falsehoods about America than he could have answered in as many days . The fact was that America had come and saved France from the Nazis , America had poured out her blood and treasure ; she was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become bribery , a seduction of the sacred virgin known as Marianne . America was Wall Street , and the Kremlin was the true and only friend of the workers of the world . Who was there to withstand this hurricane of hate ? According to Denis de Bruyne , there was no one ; but Lanny knew better , for he spent part of the day in the office of Irving Brown , together with leaders of French labor who had not gone over to Moscow . Brown was there for the express purpose of balking this Communist coup d'etat . If it were to succeed it could be repeated in Italy , where the Reds were even more numerous and more powerful ; there would be nobody left in Western Europe with any power to resist , and the other countries of the Continent would go down like a row of tenpins . Who was there to resist ? Among them was a leader , six feet tall and big in proportion , with a deceptively round , jolly face and an amiable smile ; an elderly blond giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache which had been a pale yellow and was now gray . His name was Leon Jouhaux ; Lanny heard an American tourist , an elegant fur-clad lady , refer to him as Jewhawks ; so in the cable he sent home describing this crisis he took occasion to state , " The name rhymes with you-oh. "  |p271The  great General Confederation of Labor , known as the CGT , had two secretary generals , and Jouhaux was one of them ; the other was a Communist , and for years they had been fighting the battle of French labor in their office . When the strike was called Jouhaux denounced it  --  and this was a hard decision for an old man who had given nearly fifty years of his life to building up the organization . But the Reds had taken over and were running it , and it was no longer a French organization , but a Soviet one . Jouhaux issued a blast on the French radio , calling the strike anti-French and anti-working class . And so the fury of the Communists was turned upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street imperialists , the Marshall Plan warmongers "  --  a man who for decades had been known to them as " the General , " who had spent the war years in a Nazi concentration camp because of his loyalty to them . Jouhaux saw this strike for what it was : a foreign invasion of the land . The executive committee had called the strike without even the formality of a ballot , and now the Red terroristswere roaming the countryside , breaking the heads of workers who would not obey them ; tearing up railroad ties , heaping them in bonfires , then twisting the rails ; wrecking trains , flooding mines , putting boards studded with nails on the highways to deflate the tires of trucks . The " General " stuck to his office in the CGT , resisting the efforts of the Communists to expel him . His lieutenants came , young fellows whom he had trained and who now were even more determined than he was  --  pushing the old man on , after the bold way of youth . From his office they directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their lives . All over France the CGT workers proceeded to organize a new group of resistance . They called it the Force Ouvriere , the working-class force , and during the two weeks it took to break the strike they acquired eight hundred thousand members . The loyal workers organized armed committees to defend the mines from sabotage ; they organized groups to patrol the railroads ; they guarded the barges on the canals which spread from France all over the lowlandsof Europe and had been used by the Reds as a means of conveyingspies and saboteurs . Lanny watched the battle from the vantage ground of Irving Brown 's office . Neither he nor Brown took an active part  --  for they were Wall Street imperialists . But they could give advice and could help to persuadekey labor leaders that President Truman had no designs upon the liberties of the French workers . Lanny had been in Poland and East Germany and had talked with refugees from the Baltic provinces and from Czechoslovakia and Hungary . Everywhere it was the samep272thing : dictatorship called democracy and forced labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern world , and French workers above all others knew the real meaning of the word . L ANNY did n't stay through the whole two weeks of the strike . He made sure what the end would be ; then he saw to the packing and shipping of his precious Rembrandt and took a plane to Cannes , to visit his family and tell them the news . Poor Beauty ! How she longed for peace in the world , and how little of it she had seen ! Then Lanny flew to Lisbon and New York . He did n't go to Washington , because he had nothing special to report . He went to Edgemere , and over the radio he told the audience of the Peace Program what the French general strike meant to America and the rest of the free world . If you wanted peace inside your country you had to convince the workers that they could get a steady improvement of their conditions by the method of education , organization , and political action . If you wanted peace in the outside world you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and convince the Soviet fanatics that they could not get what they wanted without war  --  nor could they get it by war . Ideas like this went out over the air , and a stream of discussion and controversy came back , mostly by mail , sometimes by telegraph and by visitation . There was bitter criticism , but there was also agreement and generous praise . The Peace Group would be satisfied if the bulk of their public understood what they were trying to say . The process of changing the mind of a nation , to say nothing of a world , was slow and tedious ; it might take many years , and the trouble was , no one could say how many years would be available . Laurel had much to tell her husband about the things that had happened in his absence : the speakers and the impression they had made ,  |p273the  plans that had been formed for new programs ; a stack of letters had been set aside for him to read , and also business accounts and reports . The group had figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would permit them to lose about four thousand dollars a week ; but they were n't losing that much , so they had to decide whether the world might need their advice for a longer period or whether they should spend more money to advertise what they were doing . The experts could not agree in their advice : Rick said he expected the cold war to last ten or twenty years ; Bernhardt Monck was afraid it was going to burst into flame in the year 1948 , soon to begin . Lanny got Monck on the telephone and learned that there was no news about Fritz Meissner . Monck said , " There 's not a thing we can do . Stop brooding about it . It has happened to millions and will happen to millions more . " There was no one in Edgemere with whom Lanny was free to discuss the subject , so he locked the secret in his heart . But he could n't help brooding . He had read and heard so much about the torturing of prisoners , first by the Nazis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German youth being questioned day and night by relays of tormentors ; having bright lights shining continuously in his eyes , being hung up by his thumbs , having splinters driven under his fingernails , having his testicles crushed , or his food drugged , or being shut up in a space so constructed with sharp projecting points that he could n't stand erect or sit down or lie down . All the time he would be told that there were worse things to come , and that they would be continued until he told what he was ordered to tell and signed what was put before him . What would they try to get from him ? The names of his friends and fellow students in the school who were Nazis or Nazi sympathizers ? And would he be unwilling to tell about such ? Or would it be about his father and the Volkischerbund ? Or would they want to know about his mysterious visits to the American sector , and to a mysterious personagewho had talked over RIAS under the name of Herr Frohlich ? Would Fritz assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MGB and its torturers in Berlin ? This brooding led to a strange incident and brought back to Lanny 's mind a set of questions to which he had long sought an answer . Stay/ing in his father 's home in Connecticut during World War I , he had opened his eyes one early dawn and had seen standing at the foot of his bed the figure of Rick , who then was a flier in the Royal Air Force . The figure had not spoken , but it had looked so mournful that Lanny had been terrified , taking it to mean that his best-loved friend was dead . Later he had learned that this was the time of Rick 's crash and serious injury . Some twelve years later Lanny had come into touch with an old Polish woman in New York who had the strange gift of mediumship , and he and Irma Barnes , then his wife , had taken her to Bienvenu and made her a part of their establishment . Another ten years , and he had divorced Irma and met Laurel Creston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this " psychic " gift . She had not been using it of late , being wrapped up in the affairs of the outside world . Her thoughts had to do with the morning 's mail and what had come in it , and what she was going to answer to this letter and that ; with the problem of who was to be the next speaker and how he was to be approached ; with visitors and employees , and a household to run , and two children to care for . As the poet Wordsworthhad written , " The world is too much with us ; late and soon , / Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers . " Laurel was lying on her daybed one evening with some letters and manuscripts beside her ; Lanny was in his own room reading , and he heard her voice . It was a murmuring tone , and he assumed that she was dictating ; but he had n't heard the secretary enter , and there was something about the voice that caught his attention . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes were closed . He might have assumed that she had dozed off and was talking in her sleep , but he had never known her to do that . He took it that she was in one of her trances , and he went to her side and stood listening. " ... this place , " she was saying . " There are many people here . I do not like it . They seem to be unhappy . They are sick people . They lie about . It is a bad place . I can not see very well , I think it is the darkness ; it is not my fault . I do not know what they want or why I am here . " There came a pause , and Lanny said very gently , " Is that you , Madame ? " That was how the old Polish woman had been addressed in the household of Beauty Budd . " Oh , Lanny , I am glad you are here , " said the voice . It was Laurel 's , and yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference was in his own imagination . " I have not heard from you for a long time , Lanny. "  | " I have been away and very busy . " " Your old friends need you . They come to me and ask about you . " Lanny hastily took a pencil from his pocket and a writing pad from the table by Laurel 's bedside . There was no time to bring up a chair , so he sat on the floor , making notes according to his long-time custom . " Where are you now , Madame ? " " I do not know . It is a strange thing . There are people here from Germany , but they do not tell me why they are here . There is a young man  --  wait a minute , he wants to speak . He has yellow hair and blue eyes . He is tall . He wants to speak to you , but it is not easy for him . He is unconscious . " " How can he want to speak if he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unconscious . His spirit wishes to speak . He says his name is Ferdinand ; he says you will know . " " Yes , I know . What is the matter with him ? " " He has suffered terribly . I do n't think he will stay here . " " You mean he has not passed away , Madame ? " " I mean he is unconscious , but his consciousness will return . He wants me to tell you  --  wait , he is speaking English , but he has a foreign accent . I think he is German . " " Yes , Madame , he is German . " " He is trying hard to tell you . He wants me to tell you that he has told nothing that he should not tell . He wants you to give him courage , Lanny . He is in terrible trouble . " " Tell him I love him , Madame . Tell him I trust him . Tell him he has the power . No one can take it from him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . It is a poem , he says . Something in English . It begins , Hush ' and it is  --  what is that ?  --  yes , a lullaby . Do you know such a poem ? " " I know it : Hush  --  ' t is the lullaby time is singing  --  / Hush , and heed not , for all things pass . ' " " He thinks it is a beautiful poem . " " Tell him there is a limit to what any man can suffer , and then he will come to join you , in a place where there is peace . Tell him to stand firm . " " He will go now . I think he has gone back to his world  --  to his enemies . Lanny , talk to me a little , I miss you . " Surely that seemed to be the utterance of the old woman who had been alone in the world and who had adopted Lanny as a son in her heart . " I have been working very hard , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Laurel and I are doing what we can to prevent it . " " Do not forget me , Lanny . I need to be remembered . All of us do . " The voice died away , and that was the end . Lanny sat waiting ; presentlyLaurel sighed once or twice , gave a couple of feeble groans , and at last opened her eyes . She looked at him with a touch of wonder . " I fell asleep , " she said . " No , " he told her , " you were in a trance . Madame came . " She sat up at once , wide awake , always curious about this fascinating experience . " Tell me what happened ! " " The strangest thing you could imagine , " he answered . " I ca n't tell you all because it has to do with things I must not talk about . It is a man who is in the hands of the Reds . He gave his name and made it plain that he is suffering . It 's mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted a poem to him . " This was the problem that had been haunting Lanny 's mind for just about thirty years . He did n't know the answer and feared that he was never going to know it . He found in his mind a strong resistance to the idea of " spirits " ; he did n't want to believe that it was the voice of Madame Zyszynski to which he had been listening . He did n't want to believe that any of the details had come from her mind . In this particularcase it was obvious that there was nothing in the communication which had not been in Lanny 's mind . There were his memories of Madame herself ; there was the substance of his brooding over the fate of Fritz Meissner , and , of course , the boy 's code name ; finally , there was the poem called " Scythe Song " by Andrew Lang , which Lanny had come upon reprinted in an English magazine and had cut out because he liked it . Hush  --  ' t is the lullaby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things pass ; Hush , ah hush ! and the scythes are swinging Over the clover , over the grass ! That song had something to convey on the subject of man 's destiny and his attitude toward what he was powerless to change . There was nothing new about it ; nearly three thousand years earlier the prophet Isaiah had stated , " All flesh is grass " ; the Psalmist had sung , " As for man his days are as grass ; as a flower of the field so he flourisheth . " And when the human grass was mown , did it dry up and turn top277dust and disappear ? Common sense declared it so ; but common sense was faring badly in the modern world . Two centuries ago the philosopherImmanuel Kant had announced that time was not an ultimate reality but merely a form of human thought ; and recently the formulas of Albert Einstein had confirmed this . Einstein had announced that space is curved ; and what could common sense make of that ? To say that time was a mode of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still existed , and that things which were going to exist already existed . Common sense apparently found it easier to believe in telepathy ; but what was it , and how did it work ? Apparently there was some method by which Laurel in a state of trance and without knowing it could dip into her husband 's mind and take from it things of which he was not consciously thinking at the moment and of which she would have no memory when she came out of the trance . Lanny had never mentioned the poem to her and very certainly he had never spoken the name Ferdinand . He told her now that he knew a German who had been arrested by the Reds and that Madame had talked about him . Laurel said , " Our minds are one " ; and she did n't mean just her mind and Lanny 's , she meant the mind of the German and perhaps also the mind of Madame , which might still be existing under some mode other than that of time . Lanny referred to a statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spent years investigating the case of a Boston lady , Mrs. Piper , a trance medium who was never exposed or accused of fraud . He had written that the case left you a choice between two alternatives : you could believe that Mrs. Piper had communications from the dead , or that she had access to the minds and memories of every person living upon earth . Lanny went off by himself and thought about the problem from his own special point of view . Had he learned anything about Fritz Meissner ? If any part of the communication had come out of the young fellow 's mind , it meant that he had been tortured into unconsciousness . What an odd idea , that when he had lost consciousness his subconsciousnesscould communicate with a medium ! And then , perhaps , when he came back to what we call life , he could no longer do it ! Common sense might call that fantastic ; but after all , was n't the very idea of a subconscious mind fantastic ? All the psychologists agreed that such a mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind as we conceive it ? The psychologists of materialism conceived of mind as electrons orp278electrical forces composing the atoms of brain cells . Something set off a spark , something caused a change in the position of those electrons , and a new idea popped into your head . And you yourself , investigating the phenomenon , you with your hopes and fears , intellectual curiositiesand moral purposes , you were nothing but trillions of electrons which happened to form accidental combinations ; and so you founded an empire , or wrote a book , or composed a symphony . That was common sense . Now and then when Lanny was in New York he would pick up a copy of the Daily Worker on a newsstand , because he wanted to know what the Communists were doing and saying . He read that Hansi Robin was giving a concert in one of the large halls on the East side , and when he told Laurel about it she said , " Let 's go and hear him . " She was free now , for the baby was weaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone about this project , for they were supposedto he cool toward the Hansibesses . They did n't have any Communistson their Peace staff , and Laurel wanted to make it plain that they had no tolerance for them . But when they were alone they talked a great deal about Hansi and wondered how he was getting along . He must be a lonely man indeed , but Lanny hesitated to try to see him again . They motored into the city , had dinner at one of the hotels , and then drove to the neighborhood of the hall . Their car was not conspicuous , for a number of people came from uptown to hear this violinvirtuoso . Lanny bought seats in the balcony , where they would be less apt to be seen by anyone who knew them . About them was a crowd , mostly young people , and nearly all foreigners or of foreign descent . They were , as they proclaimed themselves , " the wretched of the earth . " That was nothing to their discredit in the eyes of two ardent friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they espoused a program of hatred and cruelty . Many , of course , were there for music and that alone , music having no class divisions and knowing no class enemies . When the tall , blackcladfigure of Hansi Robin appeared upon the stage they greeted him with vigorous applause and kept it up ; there was no way to tell how many were applauding a musical magician who would lead them into a land of dreams , and how many were hailing the new , the real , the very imminent social revolution.  |p279Hansi  had got himself a young man as accompanist . He had done this at the party 's orders , so he had told Lanny . Hansi was a " name character , " as the jargon had it ; he was to be exploited for his fame and his earning capacity . Bess , on the other hand , had become a secret worker . She had given up her party card and was no longer listed as a member . Such persons never appear in public and are never mentioned in the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order her to divorce her husband , but they were not permitted to appear in public together . She would never again enter any party headquarters or be seen with a known party official . For her to enter the Russian Consulate or the Amtorg office would have been unthinkable . Hansi Robin never spoke from the platform ; he let the music speak , and if there was any " class angling " it was supplied by the imagination of the audience . Hansi seldom played Bach or other music in which the element of structure was important ; he played tumultuous music , music of passion , and whether it was Paganini or Tchaikovsky , Berliozor Prokofiev , the hearers made their own interpretations of it ; they marched to battle with it , they stormed the barricades with it , they shouted with its rage or its triumph . And when Hansi reached the climax they rose and gave him such an ovation as only a conqueringcommissar receives . The mob spirit flamed so high that it frightenedLaurel , and she whispered to her husband , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing more harm than good ! " The crowd clamored for encore after encore , and at last when Hansi was tired he played " Home , Sweet Home , " and the show broke up with laughter . They crowded to the platform before he could make his escape . Women were in the forefront . It was always that way ; they went crazy over him . He stood with the fiddle in his left hand and the bow in his right hand , holding them in front of him defensively . " They can not storm the breastworks , " he had said to Lanny and Laurel with his quiet humor . By holding the instruments he made sure that nobody could get to shake his hands and ruin them . The two friends did not try to approach him . Bess might be there , or she would have a party representative to take care of him and watch him . So precious a piece of freight would never be left alone . One or more of them would drive him out to his home . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the intimacy . They would plaster him with flattery on the way , and he would not enjoy it.  |p280Driving  back to Jersey , Laurel said , " You ought to see him , Lanny , and cheer him up . He is having such a miserable life . " So late the next morning , the time when Bess was apt to be gone about her business and Hansi either practicing or composing , Lanny drove to a nearby town and dropped some coins into the box of a pay station . He disguised his voice and asked , " Who is that ? " If it had been anyone but Hansi he was prepared to say , " Wrong number , " and hang up . But it was Hansi , and Lanny said quickly , " North end of the Mall in Central Park , ten o'clock tomorrow morning . " Hansi said , " Right , " and that was all . It had been done so quickly that Lanny felt sure no spy could have heard it . He had picked out that spot because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communists would be busy with their jobs on a weekday morning and not apt to be strolling in the middle of Central Park . He got there a bit ahead of time and sat buried in the reading of his newspaper . He did not look up when a taxicab came along the other side of the drive and a man got out , paid the driver , and took a little stroll until the taxi had disappeared . Then he came over and hopped in beside Lanny and away they went . There really seemed no chance that they could be caught this time . Lanny drove rapidly north , out of the park and up to the George Washington Bridge . On the other side was the drive that went up the Hudson River ; beautiful scenery , but they would n't think about it for long . They would have lunch in some obscure cafe and make a day of it , if Hansi could spare the time , which he did . " I 'll have to say I 've been to a movie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As it happened , Lanny had read about one , so he told the plot and the names of the stars , enough detail so that Hansi would be able to answer his wife 's questions . " You 've no idea how closely she watches me , " he said . " We live in a state of siege , and she does n't let the enemy get near me . " " You have n't managed to convince her yet ? " " It 's a case of off-again , on-again ; one day she is satisfied and very affectionate and happy ; the next day she is assailed by doubts and watches me like a hawk . She is more afraid of you than of anybody else . " They talked about the mysterious betrayal of their previous assigna/tion . Hansi said that the two servants in their home were both comrades , and it was entirely possible that Bess had had them keep watch over a wayward husband ; but he did n't think they had overheard that telephone conversation . It was easier for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Lexington Avenuecorner . " The Mall is a much better place , " he said . " Let 's meet there in the future . " So they agreed . Lanny told of having been to the concert and of his reaction and Laurel 's . Hansi said , " For the comrades it is comes the revolution ' ; but there are always some music lovers , and I play for them . Of course , when Bess asks me to play something , that is a command , and I obey ; she is the one I have to please . I do n't know whether she has been officially appointed my party boss , but she has taken that role and controls my affairs . " " Have you managed to toughen your skin , Hansi ? " " It is a terrible life . I have n't a single human being I can talk to frankly  --  I mean , excepting you , and I am afraid to see you . Post wo n't let me come to the office any more ; you gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known and too important ; so I have to meet a man in a car as I meet you . I give him what material I have , and he gives me orders , and that does for another week unless I strike something urgent . " " How long do they expect you to go on with this ? " " They do n't know , Lanny ; at any rate they do n't tell me . It depends on circumstances . They are on the trail of a network of spies . I have been able to guide them to a place in New York where the microfilm is developed , and you can imagine how important that is . The trail leads right up to one of the principal Consulate people . " " What will they do to him ? " " They ca n't do anything but put him out ; he has diplomatic immunity . But there are others who can be jailed . I suppose the governmentpeople are playing them along until they make out a perfect case . " " Is n't it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime ? " " They do n't tell me much about it , but I gather they are playing the Reds for suckers . They are supplying them with information that looks good but is n't . You can see how it must be in some big industry , carrying on research to perfect a new invention or a technique . They try various schemes that do n't work out . Sometimes they go a long way ; they get formulas , blueprints , working models , all kinds of thingsp282that cost a lot of money and then do n't pay off . They are getting a lot of those things together and making it possible for the spies to steal them ; the Soviet people are just gobbling them up , paying money for them and flying them to Moscow by special couriers . It means they will waste a lot of time and money and get nowhere . Then maybe they will shoot the spies and save us the trouble . " " This world gets more like a melodrama every day I live in it , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show , Hansi . " " I 'm trying to , " was the reply , " but it 's not my temperament . I guess I 'm too emotional . I 'm trying to discipline myself ; but what it will do to my music I do n't know . " Said Lanny , " Your fiddle would n't be of much use to you if you were shipped off to Siberia and put to work in a coal mine . " Lanny told a little about the case of Fritz Meissner , not naming or describing him , simply saying that he was a German who had been doing espionage work for the Americans and had disappeared without a trace . " Here in New York , " Lanny said , " it is just a class war , but there it 's both class war and national war . It 's so close and so hot that you can feel the enemy 's breath in your face . " He described the events of the Writers ' Congress and told of the new decision , that RIAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told about his visit to Paris and the scenes he had witnessed there . Thorez , the leader of the Communists , had remarked , " This is not a strike , it is a battle . " These stories were of vital importance to Hansi ; they gave him fresh courage and made him realize that he was not alone in the world ; that he was right in what he was doing ; and especially that he was right in deceiving his wife and bringing her efforts to failure . Lanny knew Bess ; he had known her from her childhood , close to a decade before Hansi had entered her life . " Can you bear to have me talk frankly about her ? " asked the musician . Lanny said , " The last time I talked to her I could have boxed her ears . " " She regards me as her trophy , Lanny . She wears me as a military man wears his decorations . She is proud of me and exhibits me , but at the same time I am her property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a robber . She takes care of me the same way she wouldp283take care of a diamond tiara ; she watches everybody who comes near me . If she sees a woman showing too great interest in me she wants to tear her hair out , or her eyes . " " The Communist women , I imagine , are not much troubled by timidity . " " Oh , my God ! The Communist women are trained from girlhood to go after men and bring them in ; to seduce them , indoctrinate them , compromise them  --  anything to get them into the movement . The Communist boss will point out a target , a man who has something the party wants  --  a lawyer who will defend them , a legislator who will vote for a bill , a reporter who will write up their stories , a labor leader who will call a strike , or just an ordinary rich man who will put up the funds for their fellow-traveler organizations , their papers , their Workers ' Aid , or whatever it may be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How can I know ? Bess goes off for an hour , a day , or a week , and when she comes back she does n't say where she has been ; the words party work ' are supposed to cover everything . But she questions me on where I 've been and what I 've been doing , and I have to answer her . I have to keep her satisfied at all hazards ; my progress and usefulnessin the party depend upon her support . The party bigwigs ask her if I can be trusted , and if she does n't say yes , then I am out . " " They are terrible people , Hansi ! " " There are some good people among them ; people who come in believing the propaganda that they love the workers , that they believe in peace , and that all they seek is the abolition of poverty and exploitation . Sometimes it takes a year or two , but in the end the good peoplefind out what the party really is and get out . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have let their names be used , they have even taken out party cards  --  and so they are ruined for life . They have the fear hanging over them that they will be exposedand will lose their jobs , their influence , their careers . " " It 's the dogma that brings out the worst in them , Hansi . At least that 's the conclusion I 've come to . " " It 's the teaching and the practice of hatred . I have watched it  --  I have become an expert in this study of hatred . It ruins the minds of both men and women . They say they hate only their class enemies , but it does n't work that way . They get into a dispute over party doctrineand in no time at all they are hating the persons who hold the wrong ideas . They seek power and are jealous of those who get it . They ca n't have the smallest conference or party meeting withoutp284hurling accusations at each other , calling each other abusive namesdeviationist , Social Fascist , Trotskyite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street , renegade , betrayer , and so on without end . They are full of suspicion , they attribute bad motives to everybody . They cultivate bad manners , which they consider the proper proletariansignature . I listen to them in amazement and wonder where all this comes from ; I never heard it in Holland , where I was brought up , nor in Germany , and surely not in America . Where does it come from ? " Lanny answered with some reluctance , " I have made up my mind that it is something out of Russia . It is a product of age-old despotism and terror . It is the way of life where people are suspicious because their lives depend upon it ; they are in danger of being poisoned or stabbed every hour . We in the free world can not understand it , ca n't even believe it . " " That is it ! " exclaimed Hansi . " I shudder sometimes when I see it . I say to myself , My God , I 'm back in the Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They had come to the country below West Point , where the HudsonRiver narrows between mountains . They stopped at a little cafe by the roadside , where it seemed unlikely that anyone would recognizethem  --  and nobody did . After lunch they rode again and stopped at a lonely place and got out to admire the view . Snow had fallen up here , and the hills were beautiful with a fresh white coat glistening in the sun . They locked the car and climbed a little knoll from which the view of the river was magnificent . " How much like the Rhine ! " Hansi exclaimed , and Lanny agreed . But there were no castles . It was the country Washington Irving had made famous by his tales . They could have imagined the little men who caused the thunder by their playing ninepins ; they could have imagined Rip Van Winkle waking in the meadow from his twenty-year sleep . But no such thoughts occurred to them ; they were not romancing about things past , they were helping to make the events of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat on it , looking up and down the river . The New York Central Railroad ran along the opposite shore , and there were houses here and there , but the hills above were mostly forest-clad and as nature made them . Nature was beautiful  --  at least it appeared so on a mild and bright winter day ; butp285man tormented himself and his fellows , and this fact made natureloveseem like idleness and futility . Hansi took the occasion to become confidential about the strange love-life he was having . He had been rapturously in love with Bess and had all these old impulses , these memories of happiness ; but they were in conflict with everything that was now in his mind  --  his ideas , his judgment , his intellectual being . " It 's a terrible thing to say , Lanny , but the plain truth is that I do n't like Bess any more . Can you imagine that ? " " I can imagine it very easily , Hansi . I have the same feeling toward her . " " She is dogmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clings to them and will not face any facts that seem to oppose them . Russia is everything right and America is everything wrong . If you try to show her something that is wrong in Russia she evades the issue by showing you something that is wrong with America . It is a question of proportion , and she has lost that sense . She talks about how happy we were during our two years there ; but that was in the early days of the war , and the Soviet leaders were frightened and needed help and were grateful . We were there to help them , and they idolized us . " " I imagine you met mostly the people of the art world , the cultured classes . " " Yes , of course . And if Bess went back there today as a political person she would find it entirely different . The men who rule the Soviet Union do n't trust Americans any more , and they might give her orders she would n't like . But there 's no use trying to tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're trying to be a help to the FBI . " " I believe everything she tells me , I do everything she tells me to do . I make a success  --  like giving that concert and making money for her group  --  and then she is radiantly happy . She comes to me and I have to take her in my arms  --  and it seems like a sort of prostitution . " Lanny answered , " Tell yourself you 're taking a leaf out of the party book . " Then , after a little thought , he added , " I 'm afraid , Hansi , you 're going to have to make up your mind to break with Bess . " " I am forcing myself to face that fact . " " You 'll find it a relief in the end . " " Sometimes I think so . I think it will be safer to be alone . Then I think about you and Laurel , and I realize how pleasant it might be to have a wife I could agree with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you appear ? "  |p286Lanny  smiled . " There was a German philosopher , Count Keyserling , who came over here before the war and lectured to us . I did n't like him , but I remember one thing . He said , Marriage is a tension . ' Laurel is a person of very decided views , and she sometimes tells me things I already know , and it would n't be polite to interrupt her . She sometimeshas an idea for the Peace Program that I do n't agree with ; and if it turns out that she was right , that makes it no easier . I have decided that the two most important things in marriage are kindness and loyalty . " Lanny thought for a bit and then said , " Tell me , are they going to arrest Bess ? " " They have promised to do the best they can for her , but you can see it would make a bad smell if they were to arrest half-a-dozen poor devils who are implicated and let off the daughter of a great capitalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to , but I know enough to be sure it 's going to make a sensational case . It has some of those picturesque features that the newspapers delight in . " " And you do n't know when it 's going to break ? " " I have n't an idea in the world , Lanny . For all I know they may be arresting the people at this very moment . They have a number of men working on the case , I know , and they will act when they are satisfied they have enough evidence . " " And what about you ? Are you going to have to testify ? " " That is one of the things that have to be decided . They want me to go on with the work , but I do n't know whether I can stand it . If they put Bess out of business , what could I do in the party ? Certainly I do n't propose to pick up some Communist girl and do that kind of spying . I 'm too well known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play music and raise money for the cause ? " The sun was sinking behind the tops of the fir trees , and they got up and went down to the car and drove toward the city . On the way Hansi said , " I have an idea how to cover my absence . There 's a young fellow named Benny Stultz whom I taught for a while , and this season he has found a place with the Philharmonic . The last I saw him he told me he had a composition he wanted very much for me to hear , and I promised I 'd try to make an appointment . I 'll phone him , and if he 's at home I 'll go there ; then I can phone my home , and if Bess is there I have a perfect explanation of my absence . If she is n't home yet I 'll have a convincing story to tell her when shep287287comes . She might take the trouble to check on it , you know ; she might call Benny and congratulate him on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or something of that sort . You understand , I am married to the party line . " When they got near the city Hansi got out at a drugstore and telephonedand came back and reported that his friend was at home and would be delighted to see him . So when they got near a subway entrancethe car stopped . Hansi said , " Thanks for the pleasantest day in a long time . It has done me a world of good . " He stepped out and walked away  --  and not toward the subway entranceuntil the car had passed on . No wandering comrade must see him and spoil his perfect alibi ! When you have had your picture featuredin the Daily Worker every month or so , and when only two nights ago you have stood for a couple of hours before an audience of a thousand , you ca n't expect to go wandering around the streets of New York and not have somebody turn and look at you and then go home and say , " What do you think ? I saw Hansi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him but I did n't have the nerve . " The twenty-fifth of December came ; it had been Christmas day precisely sixteen hundred and two times , ever since the Church decided that it was a mistake to celebrate it in the spring , when it coincidedwith the birthday of Mithras , the god of a rival religion . Once more the important Budd clan would assemble at the home of its oldestmale member ; once more they would smile and exchange friendly greetings , no matter how much envy , hatred , malice , and uncharitablenessthey might have in their hearts ; once more they would eat too much and afterward wish they had n't . The left-wing branch of the family in New Jersey would be packed in the car and transported round by the way of the George WashingtonBridge and the parkways . All four of them would have to go , for it was unthinkable that the clan should not have an opportunity to see and greet the almost-year-old baby . It would be the first time that precious mite had been taken outside the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most hygienically broughtupbaby to be found inside the populous state of New Jersey . It had been perfectly fed , perfectly trained , perfectly guarded , and if it had ever been kissed or dandled it had been without the knowledge of its mother . It was still slightly ahead of the Gesell schedule and was tod/dling around on tottery legs . Now it was going where there were people who might have colds or might have just had the flu , and at the cost of whatever unpopularity , its mother and its conscientious nurse were going to see that nobody implanted any germs upon its lips , cheeks , or forehead . Lanny drove , and Laurel sat beside him and once in a while made suggestions . The nurse and the baby sat in the back seat in one corner , and Junior had the rest of the car to himself and a whole window to look out through . He could n't keep still for a moment and was beside himself with delight at the wonders of the American highway . In truth there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars of all sizes and colors and shapes went flying by in an endless string , and every time one passed close , the youngster would cry , " Woosh ! " It was a white Christmas , and children were out with their sleds and skating on the ponds ; you could see your breath in the cold , but inside the magical car it was warm . The world was endlessly mysterious and delightful . The only way you could find out about it was by asking questions . Junior did . And then at the end of the journey was that magnificent big house and a crowd of people , old and young , many of whom Junior remembered . There was a tree and there were presents , and a dinner , at a separate table and in a separate room for the children . They were all dressed up , and they all had names , and they chattered about their families and the schools they went to and the games they played . Lanny Junior was going to kindergarten , but soon he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with eager curiosity . Frances and Scrubbie had followed in their car . Lanny 's daughter of course rated as a member of the tribe , and the younger son of an English titled family rated not so low in America as at home . Frances had been the guest of Robbie and Esther in the past , and now she would renew her acquaintance with the younger members of the family , exchange news with them and play table tennis . Meantime Laurel heard what the ladies thought about the Peace Program , and the gentlemen heard about what Lanny had seen in Germany and France . They all knew that Robbie 's son had been born out of wedlock , and they also knew that he had been a Pinko ; but he had made good , and they gathered round to ask what he thought about the prospects of our being driven out of Berlin , and about the Redp289strike which had come so near to taking possession of France . Was there any hope whatever for Europe , or were we just pouring our money into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from a Red himself , but somehow he had managed to meet all the important people and to know the inside of affairs . Lanny was probably the only Democrat in this mansion , unless perhaps there were some among the servants . But the world was going his way , and there seemed to be nothing you could do about it any more . Lanny had been planning to drive his family home that night ; but Robbie said the roads would be full of drunks and anyhow he wanted to have a quiet talk with his son . So the little family stayed over , and in the morning Lanny was closeted in his father 's study , which was full of books the old man had been intending to read all his life . First of all he wanted to know about Bess and the awful thing that was hanging over the family . Lanny had to tell him that he did n't know anything new . Robbie had , of course , not been told of Hansi 's dealing with the FBI , and Lanny had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that he had not seen Mr. Post of the FBI and had no knowledge of what the organization might have learned or might be intending to do . From his general knowledge of their techniques he could guess that they were giving the conspirators rope to hang themselves with . One thing could be taken as certain , the government would not drop the matter , so Robbie must be prepared for something serious . He had n't said a word about it to his wife . Then there was Paris and Lanny 's visit to the de Bruyne family . Robbie knew that his old-time business associate Denis pere had died , but he was interested to hear about the son and heir and his attitude toward Budd-Erling and toward his country 's politics and prospects . It would be a terrible thing indeed if the Reds were to get France ; the rest of Europe would fall like a house of cards . It amused Lanny to tell his father about Irving Brown and his efforts to aid the Marshall Plan all over the Continent . Robbie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFL . He had always taken it for granted that the labor unionists were more or less camouflaged Reds ; to learn that they were spending their good money to fight the Cocos in France opened up new vistas in the mind of a staunch Republican industrialist.  |p290The  family was stowed in the car and they set out westward . Lanny had telephoned Johannes Robin and agreed to stop by for a visit ; it would have been a cruelty to neglect those friends . They too had had a Christmas party , because it was the custom of the country ; it gave delight to the children and did no harm . A sad party for Mama Robin , because of the great gap in the family . Hansi and Bess had n't come ; they were off on some of their party affairs . Hansi came to see her very seldom now , she said ; it was because she could n't keep the tears from her eyes in his presence ; she had them in her eyes now when she told Lanny and Laurel about it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to hurt his feelings , but he knew that she blamed the Budd family in her heart . They were goyim , and Hansi should have married some good Jewish girl ; she might even have been willing to employ a shadchen , a marriage broker . Lanny might have pointed out to her that it was not unknown for Jewish girls to turn into Reds ; but he did not pursue that painful subject . The two Hansibess boys , as Lanny called them , were spending the holidays here . They were very nice boys , ten and twelve , and were outside happily building a snowman ; inside , their grandmother lamentedtheir sad lot . They were practically orphans . Their parents were engaged in activities about which they would n't tell anyone . The boys were half Jewish and half Christian , but they were really neither  --  they hardly knew what the word God meant . Every night Mama told them tales out of the old Jewish holy books , to arm them against the day when the wicked Communist party would try to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and kept them from being kissed , while Lanny talked with old Johannes , now failing in health , and told him what he had seen in Berlin and Paris . Gott sei Dank that the family was living on the peaceful shore of Long Island Sound ! The more you watched affairs in the old world the more glad you were to be living in the new . Johannes declared that half the people in Europe and Asia would come to the United States if they were able to gain admission . He gave it as his expert opinion that Western Europe was through ; it would be on the downgrade from this time on . A shrewd and intelligent man who had made a great fortune in Germany and lost itp291to the Nazis , Johannes knew how things had been in the old days , and refugees kept him informed as to how things were now . He had been reading about the downfall of ancient Greek civilization ; those little states had destroyed one another and themselves by incessant wars , and in the end the more primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of Western Europe it would be the more primitive Russians from the north . There was no possibility of saving the border states ; country after country was being devoured , and you could hear the crunching of the bones . On the previous evening Lanny had listened to his half-brother Percy Budd , who had just returned from big-game hunting in Africa . He had described how it felt to be sitting in a seat built in the crotch of a tree , waiting at night for the approach of a great lion . A goat blatting with fear had been staked out under the tree in a clear spot , and the lion had leaped upon it and broken its neck with a single stroke of its paw . Percy had given a vivid account of the sounds as the lion tore the creature to pieces , snarling in the meantime at the hyenas , or jackals , or whatever lesser creatures were waiting at a distancefor the remnants of the feast . Johannes said that was a good image , only in this case it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio and you could hear the crunching of the bones of Czechoslovakia and Poland , Hungary and Rumania . Pretty soon it would be Greece and Iran  --  and at the opposite end of the heartland the small far-off peninsula of Korea . Lanny went home and did as Johannes had suggested ; his job requiredhim to listen to news broadcasts and to read several newspapers and magazines . Rick , having a lame knee , did even more reading ; he would mark passages for Lanny , and once or twice a week they would get together for a conference on the state of the world and what the Peace Program should say about it . During the month of January Pravda announced that the Soviet government had forbidden Dimitrov to carry out his plan for a Balkan Federation . This Dimitrov had been one of the revolutionary heroes ; he had been accused by 6e Nazis of starting the Reichstag fire and had defied them in a sensational publictrial in Leipzig . But now the Soviet sat down on him hard . Nations that were to be devoured separately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same month the Communist party of France served thep292demand that their parliamentary deputy Jacques Duclos should lic permitted to become the first vice-president of that nation . It was this Duclos whose pronouncement in a French magazine had turned the American Communist party upside down and put Foster in the place of Browder . His request now meant that France was to consent to her own slow death . In that same month the value of the franc in relation to the dollar was officially reduced from a hundred and nineteen to two hundred and fourteen . Lanny should have waited to pay for that Rembrandt ! In the month of February the Soviet government protested to the government of Iran against its receiving aid from the United States ; and in the same month the Czech government brought on a crisis by protesting against Communist infiltration of the police . Four days later a so-called Communist Action Committee took over all the publicoffices of Czechoslovakia , all departments , newspapers , and radio stations . In vain did the United States , Britain , and France denounce this setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tree had denounced the lion he might have frightened it away from its prey , but not so with the Russian bear  --  he would only snarl more loudly . And from the other side of the great heartland came the sound of yet other bones being crunched . The Soviet government informed the United Nations that it would not permit a United Nations commission to investigate conditions in North Korea ; and a couple of weeks later Soviet headquarters in North Korea announced the setting up in that land of a Democratic People 's Republic and the organizing and trainingof a Democratic People 's Army . All the world knew by now what those adjectives meant . " Democratic " meant that there would be an election with only one ticket , and people who wanted to stay out of slave-labor camps would go to the polls and vote for it by something like 99.8 per cent . A " people 's government " meant that the people would be governed by it , and a " people 's army " meant that the people would be drafted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ready . Bones , bones !  |p295L  ANNY and Laurel had a special and particular reason for listening to the radio and for looking at headlines whenever they past a newsstand . But they could n't do these things all the time especially not when they had waited for many weeks and might wait hfor more . They had to go to the office and read their dictate answers ; when they were at home they had to put the on editing a manuscript or reading a book . And so it came about that somebody else got the news them . Lanny was in his little office , busy dictating letters to I tary , when there came a tap on the door . It was a girl , one who opened the mail ; she was half breathless with exciteme Mr. Budd  --  excuse me for interrupting  --  something terrible 1 pened . " " What is it ? " Lanny asked . He could pretty nearly guess prepared himself for a first-class job of play acting . " Oh , Mr. Budd , my sister lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoned me they have a headline out  --  " " Yes , yes , " said Lanny . " What ?

" " And Mrs. Robin ! " Presumably the girl had been trying " and your sister , " but she had n't been able to get out the awfu Lanny did his first-class job . " But what for ? " he asked . " It says they are Communist spies ! " So Lanny did no more dictating that morning . He jumped went into the radio room and turned on the receiving set . Ibyheart where to look for news at any particular period.  |p296had  followed him , and his secretary and others in the office came streaming in . He might have closed the door and kept the radio low , but that would have been cruel . They were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well get it here as anywhere . He turned it up , and the whole office came to listen . They heard : " . . . arrests continuing . The FBI refused any further comment on the matter . They would not state the location of the photographic studio , but rumor has it located on Delancey Street . A pickup truck was loaded with photographic material and papers at the place . Severalof the alleged conspirators were arrested there and others at their homes . It is said that one of the Russians involved enjoys diplomatic immunity , but this is uncertain , and the FBI refused to discuss the question . They have been watching the spy ring for months and have obtained a great deal of evidence , both at the spy center and at the homes of those spies who are employed in the factory . " It is not known whether or not the home of Mr. and Mrs. Robin has been searched . Both he and his wife have been active in the Communistparty and have made no secret of their beliefs .

Her father is Robert Budd , president of BuddErlingAircraft in Newcastle , Connecticut , and her mother is Mrs. Esther Remsen Budd , daughter of the president of the First National Bank of Newcastle . Hansi Robin 's father is Johannes Robin , who was reputed one of the wealthiest capitalists of Germany and was jailed by the Nazis and lost his fortune there . He is now head of the sales departmentof Budd-Erling Aircraft in New York . " More news in just a moment , but first here is an important word from our sponsor .

"  |p297It  was permissible for Lanny to be disturbed by that news and to jump into his car to drive to the house to tell his wife . That left the members of the staff in their different rooms to chatter excitedly . There would n't be much work done for an hour or two ; that too was excusable . At home Lanny discovered that Laurel had just been told the news by a neighbor and friend of the program who had called up . Alone by themselves , husband and wife did n't have to do any play-acting . They could shut their door and discuss quietly the course of events . Lanny said , " Evidently the FBI means for Hansi to go on . If they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How long do you suppose they will hold him ? " Laurel asked . " I do n't know what the federal procedure is . No doubt they will be admitted to bail . " " Poor Hansi ! It will give him a dreadful black eye . " " Yes , but on the other hand it may take him into the very heart of the Communist underground . That , I am guessing , is what the government is figuring on . " The telephone began ringing . It would ring all day . One friend after another called up to commiserate , and some , of course , out of curiosity , in order to be able to tell their friends how the couple were taking the dreadful news . Presently there was a call from New York , a woman 's voice . " Mr. Budd ? This is Mercy Colfax . I do n't know if you will remember me ; you had tea in my studio in Greenwich Village many , many years ago . " " Oh yes , " Lanny said politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I am the secretary of the Liberal Defense League . I would like very much to see you , Mr. Budd  --  as soon as possible . " " Could you come out to Edgemere ? " " With pleasure , Mr. Budd . " " Very well then . Come to my house , please . I expect to be at home the rest of the day . " " I will come by the first train . " Lanny hung up . " Mercy Colfax , " he said to Laurel , who was in the room . " She is Bryn Mawr and Boston Back Bay . I met her several times in the old days when I was knocking about in Greenwich Village.  |p298She  's been in all the radical groups . Someone said she was Communist , but I did n't worry about that in those days . We were all practicing what we called the united front . ' We found the Communists useful because they were hard workers ; we called them good radicals . ' " " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secretary of the Liberal Defense League ; that will be a Commie front , no doubt . They have taken up all the good words and poisoned them . You ca n't say liberal , ' you ca n't say democratic , ' you ca n't say people 's , ' you ca n't say worker 's ' any more . She is coming to ask me to put up bail for Bess and to help pay her lawyers . " " What will you say to her ? " " I 'll say plenty . It will be a show you wo n't want to miss , but I want her to think we 're alone , so you can listen at a crack in the door . She might become confidential , or she might get angry and say more than she means . " " Mercy ? " said Laurel . " What an unusual name for a Red . " " She 's old Puritan , of course , " he answered . " Probably some of her forefathers came on the Mayflower . In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wager . " It took Miss Mercy Colfax a couple of hours to make connections and reach Lanny 's home ; she arrived in a taxi and may have come all the way in it . He remembered her as a sturdily built , round-faced woman with flaxen hair cut short , in the fashion of the flappers . Now her hair was longer and snow white , but her face was still unlined , and she held herself with dignity . Seated in the living room of the Budd home she stopped for no preliminaries . " I suppose , Mr. Budd , you have heard the terrible news . " " I have heard it three times over the radio and about a dozen times over the telephone , Miss Colfax . It is a blow to me , and a worse blow to the family . We all knew that Hansi and Bess were Communists , but we had no idea they were engaged in underground activities . " " I am shocked to hear you say such a thing , Mr. Budd . Surely you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hansi and Bess are perfectly innocent , the victims of a wretched conspiracy inspired by the redbaiters . " " I hope you are correct , Miss Colfax , " said Lanny mildly . " Before we go any further , let me ask you one question . Are you a Commu-nist ? "  |p299The  lady 's tone became precise and puritanical . " I am , as I told you , Mr. Budd , the secretary of the Liberal Defense League , and I have come to see you in that capacity . " " Yes , but I do not know about the League , Miss Colfax , and I can only judge it by its secretary . Are you a Communist ? " " What my personal beliefs are surely have nothing to do with the question , Mr. Budd . " " From my point of view they have everything to do with it , so I hope you will answer my question . " " Please let me tell you what I have come for  --  " " You understand of course that if you refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Communist . " " I can not help what conclusions you draw , Mr. Budd . I beg you to hear what I have to say . " " Certainly I will hear you , Miss Colfax , but I wish you to know in advance that I know I 'm listening to a Communist . " " I assure you , Mr. Budd , that this series of arrests is an act of provocationon the part of the reactionary forces in our government . It is an effort to intimidate those few intellectuals who have had the courage to speak on behalf of peace and against the frenzy of redbaitingthat has seized our public . " Lanny 's tone was no less precise . " You have refused to admit that you are a Communist , Miss Colfax . I will tell you that I have known many Communists , and I know all their phrases , and when a Communisttalks about peace and freedom I am not fooled for a single instant . I am not going to argue with you ; I am just telling you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ca n't be meaningless to you , Mr. Budd , that your sister and your brother-in-law have been thrown into jail  --  Hansi Robin , one of the great musical artists of our time ! " " Yes , Miss Colfax ; but I did my suffering a long time ago , when I saw that they were becoming Communists . I warned them what would happen , and now I have a clear conscience in the matter . " " And you mean that you would let your own sister rot in jail ? " " I mean that I know perfectly well my own sister will not be in jail more than a few hours . I know that my own sister belongs to an organization which has immense resources , collected in part from our enemies abroad and in part from wealthy dupes at home . Let them put up the bail and pay the Red lawyers . I certainly will not . " " I have never been more shocked , Mr. Budd  --  " " I 'm truly sorry to shock you , Miss Colfax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name alone I would know who your forefathers were and what your heritage is . Bess has the same heritage , and so have I. I say to you what I said to her years ago : I know that you joined the Communist party from the noblest of motives , a real sense of mercy , of pity for the poor and oppressed . It is terrible indeedto see such idealism betrayed . I beg you to open your eyes to the facts and realize that your cause has been taken over by gangsters . It has become a counterfeit revolution . It has broken all its promises and forsaken all its dreams and blasted all the hopes of its followers . It has become history 's horror . You and I who were good radicals back in the old Greenwich Village days have no place in the program of such men . They use us so long as we still have power and can be of use to them ; but the moment they have the power and need us no longer , we become a mockery to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us into jail , they subject us to hideous tortures , they send us to slave-labor camps where we exist on eight hundred calories a day and fade away in two or three years of the diseases of malnutrition ; or more mercifully they take us into a dark cellar and shoot us in the back of the neck and then carry us out and dump us into a crematory . " This granddaughter of the Puritans was sitting rigidly , her fists tightly clenched and the blood mounting into her well-rounded cheeks . " I see , Mr. Budd , that you have fallen a hopeless victim to the redbaiters ! " " Redbaiting , Miss Colfax ? Redbaiting is the crime of telling the historicalfacts about the Communist party , that it has taken up lock , stock , and barrel the program of Tsarist imperialism . It has taken the tactics also and has multiplied them in horror . Do n't you know how Engels promised that the state would wither away and how Lenin endorsedthis ? How much withering have you seen ? Do n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Lenin 's comradesand friends , have every one of them been foully murdered ? " I have been in the Soviet Union , Miss Colfax ; and before that I knew some of those men in Europe . My own uncle Jesse Blackless was one of them ; he was a painter and a fairly good one , and he gave his whole life to the cause . When I was at the Yalta Conference I met him secretly and found him a wretched , disillusioned , heartbroken old man . I knew Lincoln Steffens , who died in the same state of mind . Do n't you know the list of old Bolsheviks whom Stalin and his minionsof the Gaypayoo have had shot or poisoned ? I will call the roll to you "  --  and Lanny began , like a drill sergeant calling off the namesp301of his squad : " Zinoviev , Rykov , Rakovsky , Kamenev , Bukharin , Krylenko , Smirnov , Tukashevsky , Piatakov , Karakhan  --  " The list was too long for the woman 's patience . " That will do , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you were a liberal man , but I see I have wasted my time . " " I hope that I have not wasted my time , Miss Colfax , " he said very gently . " I hav ' planted a seed ; and sometimes a seed may lie dormant for years before it begins to sprout and take root . I have told you the truth , and it will lie in your mind , and someday you may begin to relate your observations to it , and your mind will change . If ever the time comes that you really believe in democracy and understand freedomas your forefathers and mine understood it , you may come to me with a cause that is honest , and I will not refuse help . " That was the last affront to her New England conscience . She got up and stalked out without another word , and Laurel , who had been standing behind the door , came forward , wreathed in smiles . " I am relieved , " she said . " I was afraid she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " The combination of perfect Boston and Bolshevik is horribly strange . I am sure that in her heart she looks down upon the kumrads ' from a great height . " Lanny called up his father to see how he was taking it , and more especially how Esther was taking it . Robbie said , " I was worried because I could n't prepare her , but I found that she had prepared herself . " Lanny was n't surprised , for he knew that Esther Remsen Budd , anotherdaughter of the Puritans , had intelligence enough to look at the world about her and observe where it was going . " She had it out with Bess a long time ago , " said her husband , " and she guessed what Bess was up to . What she insists now is that I must go to the jail and put it up to Bess once and for all . If she will promise to quit the Communistsfor good we will put up the bail and get the right man to defend her . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know , " replied the father . " But we must give her the chance , and then our consciences will be clear . Esther says if I do n't go she will . I just talked with Johannes about it , and he says he will do the same thing for Hansi . It wo n't do any good , of course , but we will go together . "  | " How is Mama Robin taking it ? " " He 's terribly worried about her . The poor old creature  --  he says she has n't stopped crying for a moment since she heard the news . He 's afraid it will kill her . You had better call her up and say something kind . " Lanny made a sudden resolution . " I 'll do more than that , " he said . " I 'll go see her and let her weep on my shoulder . " That would be no new thing , for Lanny Budd had met Leah Robin in Berlin when she was in the utmost despair and terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were forcing him to part with everything he owned in the world . Her youngest son , Freddi , had disappeared , and she was a fugitive , hiding like a terrified rabbit . Lanny had been able to get the husband , wife , and the older son out of Germany . He had tried to help Freddi , but in vain ; Freddi , her baby , her gentle and kind one , who had played the clarinet so charmingly and had never done harm to any living soul ! After the Nazis had brought him close to death with their tortures  --  because he was a Socialist as well as a Jew  --  they had turned him over to Lanny at the border . He had died in France and been buried according to Jewish ritual on the Riviera near Lanny 's home . Some thirteen years had passed since then , and Leah had found a safe home in America ; she was no longer rich , but then she had never wanted to be rich , so she had insisted to Lanny . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . Lanny got into his car ; there was nothing more important that he could think of at the moment . He took the familiar drive across the great bridge over the Hudson , and in due course came to the comfortablehome on the shore of the Sound . A Jewish maid opened the door and told him that Mr. Robin had left for the city . She called Rahel , who was living in this home , along with her new husband and new family . Rahel said that Mama was upstairs in her bedroom ; she would n't eat , she would n't see a doctor , would n't do anything but sob her heart out . " Maybe she will see you , " Rahel said , and Lanny replied , " I 'll go up and see her . Do n't say anything about it . " He was an old friend of that family and went upstairs and did n't even knock on the door , just opened it softly . He saw the old woman lying on the bed with her face down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death . She really was n't an old woman , notp303yet sixty , but she felt old and acted old , because she was a Jewish woman and was afraid of the L Drd her God , whose name she would not pronounce ; she knew He had stricken her , and it could only be because of her sins . She had dressed in black ever since Freddi 's death and had no thought of or interest in this world except to take care of the people she loved and save them from the afflictions that had cursed her own life . She had known pogroms as a child and had fled first from Russia and then from Germany , and now  --  Oi ! Oil  --  her afflictions had followed her here !

It is a most important secret , and you must promise me , you must give me your solemn word , you will not speak a word about it to anybody on this earth . " She went on staring , as if her thoughts were confused and she was not quite sure that he was there . " Yes , Lanny , " she managed to whisper .

If they had left him free it would have let the others know that he is against them . " " Urn Gottes Willen , Lanny ! You are gewiss ? " " I know all about it . He has been pretending to agree with Bess , but he does not agree with her . " " Ach , that woman ! She is your sister , Lanny  --  I must not say anythingbad about her ! "  | " You must be sorry for her , Mama , as we are for all blundering human souls . She became a Communist because she believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been betrayed ; the movement has fallen into the hands of evil men , but she can not see it . She will suffer terribly for her blunders ; but you have no cause to worry about Hansi . " " How long will they keep him , Lanny ? " " I have no doubt that the Communists will raise the bail and get them out in a day or two . Then they will make a hero out of Hansi ; they will trust him with their secrets . It is very important work that he is doing . " " Oh , Lanny , he is such a good man ! " " None better , Mama . I was forbidden to tell you this , but I could not bear to see you suffer ; and now you must keep the secret . " " Oh , I will keep it ! Gott sei Lob !

He will not make any promises , he will have to play the game according to orders , and you must play your game . Just tell the family that I have assured you that it will be all right , that Hansi will be bailed out , and that they do not beat prisoners in jail in New York  --  at least not if they behave themselves and do what they are told . You can say that I have assured you , that I do n't believe Hansi has done any harm to anybody and has merely spoken what he believes . He is a good man and you are going to stand by him . " So the old Jewish grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened her hair a little , and they went downstairs . Rahel and the servants were not too much surprised , for they knew that Lanny Budd was a magician and his power over Mama was great . He could not quite call spirits from the vasty deep , but he had been able to go into Nazi Germany and buy the father of the family out ofp305prison , and no doubt he would do the same thing for one of the world 's top violin virtuosos . So Lanny turned on the radio and got a station that was giving news . No war had broken out that day , no airplane had hit a mountain , no streamliner had gone off the track , so the newscasters had plenty of time for the uncovering of a spy plot and the arrest of half-a-dozen Red conspirators , including a famous musician and the daughter of a millionaire industrialist . And now  --  Ach , Gott der Gerechte ! what was this ? The man was telling how the federal agents had been to the suburban residence of the notorious couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of papers ; they had dug in the garden underneath a seckel pear tree and had come upon a large family washboiler , a metal cylinder three feet wide and almost as high , covered with a top and carefully sealed with tar . It had been there no one knew how long , and it was packed solid with papers and documents ; the load was so heavy that it took three men to lift it into a truck . What was in those papers the FBI would n't tell , but they had carted it off and no doubt were studying all the secrets of the Communist party . " Oh , mein lieber Hansi ! " exclaimed Mama and wiped her eyes with her handkerchief . Lanny did n't see any tears , but it was a proper gesture . It was such a serious matter he could n't think that a pious grandmother was exactly enjoying herself ; but , he reflected , there must be a certain amount of actress in every woman . Such had been the testimony of that long-suffering ancient called Job : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their belly prepareth deceit ! " Lanny drove back to New York in a more cheerful frame of mind . He was as excited as a boy over this spy story , the mystery of which had been building up in his mind for a long time . He drove through the city on purpose to pick up the afternoon papers , and when he had got an assortment of them he found a vacant space by a curb and parked his car and glanced through them . The story made the front page in every case ; it had everything the public wanted : crime and detection , high life and low life , glamour and wealth . Bessie Remsen Budd undoubtedly belonged in what the newspapers call " the highest social circles . " If she was n't beautiful any longer , she certainly had been , and the newspapers had her early pictures . Hansi Robin undoubtedly belonged high in the world of music ,  |p306both  in America and in countries abroad . The Jones Electrical Works had a most commonplace name , but it had undoubtedly manufactured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made improvements in the device which were the very ultimate in secrecy . All newspapers have what they call " the morgue , " a huge file of envelopes containing everything they or other papers have published about any individual . The larger and more well-to-do have the person 's story all written up to the moment , so that when he dies , marries , or gets arrested , all they have to do is to put the new developments at the top of the story and they are ready to go to press . So in these newspapersLanny could read all about Hansi Robin 's career and the career of Bessie Remsen Budd . Nobody was quite sure whether her name was really Bess or Bessie ; her friends called her whichever happened to be easier in the sentence . The papers told who her father was and who her half-brother was and gave something about the careers of both . They told how she had accompanied Hansi at his concerts , and now he was accompanying her as secret Red agent . They told about the obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to get access to confidentialpapers , correspondence , orders , blueprints , and technical , specifications . I le had taken them on Saturday night and turned them over to Bessie Budd , who had taken them to New York , where a photographic studio disguised as a stationery store had photographed them , and then they had been taken back to the accountant on Sunday . The FBI had gathered in both the Robins , the accountant , the two operatives of the photographic studio , and the two Russians who had been delivering the material to ships in the harbor . It was a clean sweep and a perfect job , and the FBI was sure it had the goods on all the parties who had been caught . I , anny read these accounts , and by that time there were new editions on the stands , with new headlines . He bought those and learned about the family washboiler which had been dug up from under the seckel pear tree in the garden of a sumptuous villa in a fashionable Connecticutshore town . Such are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some bright lad in the office of a tabloid , seeking for the alliteration which makes for picturesqueness , should dub the find the " boilerplate papers . " " Boilerplate " to a newspaper means the material which is sent out from some syndicate or central agency to hundreds of newspapers all over the country . It is put into type and papier-mache " mats " madep307of it . For the fast rotary presses on which big newspapers are printed this material is curved exactly in the shape of boilerplate  --  and when in the newspaper office the metal stereotype is made it looks still more like its name . So inevitably a mass of documents buried in a family washboiler became " boilerplate papers "  --  and the name would stick . The Federal Bureau of Investigation would say no more than this : they had come into possession of highly secret papers of the Communistunderground , and these might be the means of landing some conspicuous persons in a federal penitentiary . Lanny drove home and told Laurel what he had done . She was startled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her , " If Post had given me the secret I would have felt bound ; but I got it myself , and so I felt free to use my own judgment . I am sure Mama will keep it . " The telephone had been ringing all day . It had become a nuisance , but they had to answer , because there might be something important . Robbie called to report on his visit . He and Johannes had obtained permission from the U. S. Marshal to interview the prisoners , who were in the Federal Detention Headquarters . Bess was alone , with a matron in charge . At first she had n't wanted to see her father but had consented when he insisted . She was quiet and apparently serene ; she was sorry to hurt him and especially sorry to hurt her mother , but there was nothing she could do about it . She had her convictions and was standing by them . She was not interested in being bailed out ; of course if the comrades arranged it she would be pleased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Budd-Erling money or on Budd-Erling terms . She was a Red and meant to live and die a Red . " So that 's that , " said Robbie . " When someone is bent on martyrdom there is nothing you can do but oblige them . " Lanny asked , " How is Esther taking it ? " and the answer was , " Esther is the quiet sort . She sheds her tears inside . We ca n't change that either . " Robbie went on to add that Johannes had had no better success than he . Hansi would n't listen to any compromise and did n't want to talk about it . A little while later the elderly Jew was on the telephone , asking , " Lanny , what on earth have you done to my wife ? "  | " No harm , I hope . " " You have made her all over . What magic pills do you carry ? " It was the Johannes of old , a shrewd , experienced man of affairs , harddrivingbut generous outside business hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever going to get him down  --  not old age , not the Communist movement . Lanny answered , " I told her that Hansi loved her and he was doing what he thought was right . Also , that the U. S. Marshal does n't torture his prisoners and that Hansi would soon be out on bail . " " I told her all that , but it did no good . " Lanny was about to add , " I told her that I had been arrested several times , and it was n't fatal . " But he realized that Johannes had been arrested too , so that was no argument . He said , " How did you find Hansi ? " And the reply was , " Stubborn as a mule . He says he knows what he 's doing , and we are not to worry about him . " " How are they treating him ? " " He has no complaint . They 've put him in the room with that accountant , the fellow who stole the documents , so they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are friends , so it 's all right . " " Maybe they will let Hansi play the violin for him , " suggested Lanny , and they chuckled . When Lanny told his wife about this he said , " You see , the governmentpeople have put Hansi in with that other fellow , and in the night they will whisper secrets . " " Too bad they ca n't find a woman friend for Bess ! " remarked Laurel . She had a bit more of acid in her make-up than her husband . Next morning the telephone began to ring early ; Lanny was shaving and hurriedly wiped his chin . A voice asked , " Is this Mr. Lanning Prescott Budd ? " When he answered that it was , " I wonder , " said the voice , " if the name Virgil Smathers means anything to you ? " " The name sounds familiar , but you must excuse me  --  " " It was more than thirty years ago . Do n't you remember when you were a student at St. Thomas 's Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how badly Budd Gunmakers had treated their strikers ? " " Oh yes ! " Lanny exclaimed . " I remember well . You were the first one who opened my eyes to what was going on in America . "  | " I hope your eyes are still open , Mr. Budd . I am now the minister of the Wesley Methodist Church of Brooklyn . I called up because I want very much to come to see you . " " A good many people are asking to see me just now , Mr. Smathers , and I do n't want to be disobliging but I must ask one question . Are you going to ask me to put up any bail ? " The voice smiled audibly . " No , Mr. Budd , I promise ; and I wo n't take but a few minutes of your time . If you cut me off and tell me you 're not interested I 'll not have my feelings hurt . " " All right , " Lanny said . " I 'll be in Edgemere all day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toward noon the visitor showed up and presented his card . Lanny had recalled a slender blond young man of ascetic appearance , wearing spectacles . He still had the spectacles but the hair had turned gray . Evidently his salary had not been large enough to permit him to accumulatethat comfortable rotundity which comes with middle age in America . He was still the earnest ascetic , the professional man of good will . " It is a pleasure to meet you after all these years , " said Lanny . " What can I do for you ? " The visitor came to the point at once , as he had promised . " Mr. Budd , I wish to tell you first that I am not a Communist ; I am a servant of Jesus Christ and Him crucified . But I am one who is sometimescalled a fellow traveler because I really believe in peace and good will and try to practice what I preach . " " I appreciate the distinction , Mr. Smathers . What is it you want to tell me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons to discuss the situation which has arisen involving your sister and brotherin-law . I never met Mrs. Robin in Newcastle , she was only a child when , I was there , but I have met her more recently . I have never met Mr. Robin , but I have heard him play , of course . At the conference last night it was agreed that Mrs. Robin is a class-conscious and thoroughlydisciplined Communist and will know how to take what comes ; there is no need to worry about her . But so far as Mr. Robin is concernedthere was general agreement that he is not really a Communist ; he came into the movement because of his love for his wife and his inability to live without her . He is a great artist , and therefore an especially sensitive man . We are quite sure that he knows nothing about espionage and has no idea that such activities are possible . Hep310is an idealist and an entirely nonpolitical person ; he surely does not belong in the arena of political strife . I hope you agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smathers , what is your idea ? " " Our idea is that this should be pointed out to the government authorities . A man is not legally responsible for what his wife does ; it can not be legally assumed that he knows what she is doing . It is our idea that an arrangement be worked out whereby charges against Mr. Robin would be dropped upon the agreement that he will give up every form of Communist activity . You surely know that he is a man who would keep his word . " " I know that . But I have no idea that he would give such a word . " " Neither have we , Mr. Budd , but the inquiry could be made . " " Would that mean that he would go on giving concerts under the auspices of Communist-front organizations and raising funds which support Communist activities ? " " Of course it would not , Mr. Budd . The idea is that Hansi Robin would make his appearance only under the auspices of established musical agencies . It may be no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persons offering this proposal , Mr. Smathers ? Are they Communists ? " " Two of them are ministers like myself ; two others , I believe , are Communist sympathizers ; and two are important and active Communistparty people . There would be no use making the proposal unless it had some authority behind it . Mr. Robin would be told to make the agreement and keep it . " " Unfortunately , Mr. Smathers , Communists do not have a very good reputation for keeping their agreements . To whom do you expect to make this proposal ? " " It is the FBI which has made the arrests . Presumably they are the ones who would make the decision . It can not be that they have any real evidence against him . I am told that by people who know . " " But I do n't know those people , Mr. Smathers , and I do n't know the FBI . Why should you come to me about it ? " " Because it seems to us that you are the logical person to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suspect you of having any improper interest in the matter . " " I am not afraid of being suspected , Mr. Smathers . What I am afraid of is putting myself- at the service of men who have no respect for their pledged word and are laughing at me behind my back while they make a fool of me . " " I assure you , Mr. Budd  --  "  | " You are wasting your time assuring me of anything , Mr. Smathers , except that you yourself are a Christian gentleman . You can not assure me about anything regarding Communists because I know them and their doctrines . Surely you must be aware that Lenin advised his followersto lie , to use every subterfuge to overcome their enemies ; and I do not believe that any truth can be got by lying or that any love can come out of a gospel of hate . " " I can only assure you , Mr. Budd , that this proposition is a sincere one . " " Will you tell me who the party leaders are who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Budd , I am not authorized to do that . " " You see , they are playing with you , and they are trying to play with me . They are enemies of the government which serves us and in which we believe . " " Even enemies have to parley , Mr. Budd . If there is going to be peace there has to be a truce . " " Peace , Mr. Smathers ? The Communists can have peace any day , but they can not have it while they are followers of Stalin . " " Then you 're not willing to approach the FBI , Mr. Budd ? " " I will approach them on one condition , and that is , that you will give me the names of the Communist party leaders who are making the proposition and undertaking to see that Hansi Robin will keep it . You are not a Communist , and you can not speak for the Communists , so I would just be inviting the FBI on a hunt for a mare 's nest . " They parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not until they were driving home , where there could be no chance of being overheard . " What are you going to do ? " she asked , and he told her , " I 'll go and tell Post about it anyhow , but I 'll not let the Communists know that I 'm telling him . " He telephoned at once to Wilbur Post , saying , " I have something to tell you , but I do n't think I ought to come to your office , because I imagine there will be reporters hanging around . " " A safe guess , " was the reply , and the busy man made an appointment to meet Lanny on a certain corner at a certain hour . Lanny drove there and picked him up and told him about the visit from the Brooklyn preacher . " Smathers , " said Post . " Oh yes , we know him . " There was signifi/cance in the special way he said it . He added , " It is our practice to be cautious in what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I read about him in a newspaper : He has a soft heart and a still softer head . He is a sob-sister who wears pants . ' " Lanny assented to that description and told what Smathers had proposed . The other had a good laugh over the odd situation ; then , becomingserious , he said , " I do n't believe the real top Communists would endorse such a proposition . Hansi Robin is too valuable to them , both as moneymaker and headline-maker ; of course they do n't care a damn about his art . " Lanny inquired , " I take it that your having Hansi arrested means that you expect to go on using him ? " " Yes , surely . " " Well , suppose that Smathers were permitted to see Hansi and make that proposition to him . You could post Hansi in advance , and he could turn down the proposition flatly . He could make a speech declaringhis undying loyalty to the party , his willingness to make any sacrifices , his determination to stick . That should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him information . It would have that effect with Bess , I know . " Post thought that over . " Might n't be a bad idea , " he said . " They are all to be taken before the U. S. Commissioner and bail will be set . No doubt the Commies will be on hand with the cash , so we 'll have to work quickly on your proposition . " " I 've been thinking about it , " Lanny said . " We must n't do anything to suggest that you know me or that I know you . Perhaps the quickest way would be for you to call Smathers up and ask if he knows a man named Lanny Budd . When he says yes , you say , He telephoned saying you had a proposition for me . Why do n't you come in and make it direct ? ' " " All right , I 'll do that , " replied Post . " It ca n't do any harm , and it might do some good . There are one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . They will all be as busy as bees getting things hidden and establishing new lines of communication . " " That finding of the boilerplate papers sounds like something big , " said Lanny , who was not above human curiosity . " I do n't mind telling you it 's a stroke of luck . We are working day and night on the papers , sorting them out and indexing them . It may be weeks before we know everything we 've got . It may surprise you to know that Hansi Robin had nothing to do with that discovery . " Lanny dropped the official a block or two from his office and drovep313on about the affairs of the Peace Program . Every now and then his mind would come back to that fascinating mystery : who could be the other spy in Bessie Budd 's life ? Somebody had written two anonymous letters , and it was likely that this same person might be the one who had betrayed the secret of the buried boiler . There were two women servants in the Robin household , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a gardener , and he was a likely prospect . He was a Finn and seemed a stupid fellow  --  but then he might be a government agent pretending to be a stupid fellow . The burying of a boiler three feet in diameter requires a lot of digging ; it could have been done at night , of course , or on a Sunday ; but could the signs of such digging be hidden from a gardener ? If there had been a grass sod , that could have been replaced with care ; and if the gardener had been got out of the way on some pretext , the job might have been done in daylight without attracting any other person 's attention . If Hansi did n't know about it the job must have been done while he was away on one of his many trips . Lanny had planned such schemes himself and knew that Bess was no less capable and certainly no less determined . But she had two opponents working against her and apparently suspected neither of them . She must now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had had to think about , shut up in durance vile with nobody but a marshal 's matron for company ! It was a trying situation for the newspaper reporters . The whole country was on tiptoe with curiosity about this case , but what could the reporters get ? The prisoners were kept incommunicado , except for their lawyers , and the FBI had no more information to give out . The Communist party , of course , was willing to talk without limit , but all they had to say was propaganda . They were shocked by this persecution of innocent persons ; it was a shameless violation of fundamentalcivil rights . It was known that the president of Budd-Erling Aircraft and the head of its foreign sales department had been to interview the two prisoners in whom they were interested , but neither would say a word about what had occurred . The director of the Peace Program would say only that he disagreed with his sister 's ideas but was sure that she held them sincerely . Photographs of the various parties were , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take pic-314 THE RETURN OF LANNY BUDDtures of the hole in the ground under the seckel pear tree and of the stationery shop on Delancey Street . One of the papers even published a photograph of a Soviet ship at one of the docks in Brooklyn ; and that was all . So it was both figuratively and literally a godsend when a gentleman known to his flock as the Reverend Smathers came forward with the information that he had been permitted to interview Hansi Robin . Certain of the New York Communists , moved by the love of art and respect for a great artist , had volunteered the assertion that whatever Bessie Budd Robin had been doing , very certainly her husband had known nothing about it , and he had been arrested only because he lived in the same house with a well-known and active party member . This statement had been made to the FBI , and the suggestion had been offered to Hansi Robin that he might agree to remain what he had always been , a strictly nonpolitical person , and to confine his future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverend Mr. Smathers , Hansi Robin had firmly turned down this offer . He had insisted that his motive was loyalty not merely to his wife but to the cause of freedom of opinion and expression . He refused to make any compromise with the frenzy of redbaiting which had seized the country . He was innocent , and his wife also was innocent , and he believed that the others were innocent . The " sob-sister in pants " took occasion to add that he believed it also . When the reporters asked him about the boilerplate papers he said the Communist party was a legal organization , a part of the Americanpolitical system , and they had a perfect right to take care of their records . When they knew that their motives were being misrepresentedand their financial accounts and membership lists used for purposes of persecution , it was natural that they should take precautionsto conceal these . This was a free country , was n't it ? And a minister of the Gospel was supposed to preach peace and good will toward men , was n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join me ! " said the Reverend Mr. Smathers.  |p315SIX  of the seven accused persons were brought before the U.S. Commissioner . The seventh , a Soviet official , claimed diplomatic immunity , and all that could be done in his case was for the State Department to request his recall to his own country . The other six were Oskar Johanssen , the accountant ; Bessie Budd Robin and Hansi Robin ; Carl and Lucille Sedin , alias Carpenter , the photographers ; and J. Dumbrowsky , the Russian messenger . The Commissioner said this was a very serious case , and inasmuch as accused Communists had sometimes been known to turn up missing he felt it his duty to set the bail high . He set it at twenty thousand dollars for five of the defendants and thirty thousand for the Russian , for he , not being an American citizen , might be assumed more likely to disappear . The bail was promptly put up by a surety company . Undoubtedly that company had required guarantees ; but that was a private transaction and did not appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Russian this meant charging the Soviet governmentthirty thousand dollars for its spy . That government did n't mind , having plenty of gold mines in Siberia , to say nothing of those it had in the penthouses on Manhattan Island . To that government it was , of course , not desirable that one of its agents should be convicted in an American court . Whatever the price , they would pay it . The man would disappear from sight the moment he left the courtroom and would never again be seen . What would happen to him when he reached his own country was a matter for guesswork . The known facts were , first , he had failed , which is something absolutely forbidden by his government ; and , second , he had lived in America and learned what clothes Americans wore , what food they ate , and in general how many more privilegesp316they enjoyed than any Russian except a commissar . He might be tempted to mention what he had seen to some other Russians , and therefore the only safe thing was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What he said there would n't matter , because he would n't live more than a year or two , and neither would the persons to whom he said it . After that matters settled down again ; if it had n't been for jokes about boilerplate papers the public would have dismissed the subject from its mind altogether . Lanny and Laurel were left to speculate about the Hansibesses . They would go back to their home ; and what would they be doing ? Hansi had shown himself a hero , a brave and determined friend of a great cause . Bess would love him  --  and how would Hansi like it ? Laurel said he would stand it ; men did n't feel about sex as women did . Lanny answered that there was a good deal of the woman in Hansi . And what would Bess be doing ? Lanny ventured the guess that she was through as an underground operative . Her lawyers would forbid it , and the party bosses would agree . They had a strict rule that the party and the underground were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many party members did n't even know there was an undergroundand would ridicule the idea , calling it redbaiting . And , of course , when any underground worker got arrested and got his pictures in the newspapers , that person could no longer be in the underground . He would repudiate it , and it would repudiate him . So now the daughter of Budd-Erling would become a " name character . " She would cash in on her publicity and become a champion of her cause , one of its martyrs . Quite possibly she might take up again her role as Hansi 's piano accompanist . But perhaps only Communists would want to hear them now . Such was Lanny 's guess , deduced from Communist principles as Hansi had explained them ; and the guess proved to be correct . A week or so after the hearing Lanny was called to the telephone early in the morning . A deep bass voice enunciated , " Same place , ten o'clock this morning . " Lanny thought for a moment and then growled back , in a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the zoo , " O-o-o-oh-kaay . " He hung up , laughing , and told Laurel about it . Then he called his secretary and told her to postpone a couple of appointments.
