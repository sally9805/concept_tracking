ALMOST any oil-field town is still a good place for a man who sells window glass . But in the days before they learned how to wash the acid out of nitroglycerin , thus reducing its touchiness somewhat , the sale of window glass was astronomical at certain times . Figure it out yourself . If one half of the windowpanes in a town of 500 population were smashed , if each house contained only ten windows , each of which had twelve panes of glass  --  well , the breakage would be considerable . If it happened in winter , people had to buy glass and install it in a hurry . Sometimes the glass merchant upped his normal prices , and that did n't make him high man in any popularity poll . The losses involved were not confined to property damage ; when the deep , sinister rumble of an explosion was heard , people knew that it also meant the death of at least one man they knew  --  an oil-well shooter . Possibly lives other than that of one man would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . A matter of eighty-five years has n't changed the picture much . True , the modern shooter drives a specially constructed truck , and certainly the nitro has been adequately washed . But the stuff still remains unpredictable . It goes off with but little human provocation ; sometimes it explodes without anyone being near it . Certainly in many places oil wells are shot today just about as they were back in the days of Col. E. A. L. Roberts , that bleak and bitter man who owned an ironclad patent on a torpedo that saved the oil industry when it was only an infant and stood desperately in need of saving . A French chemist , Ascanio Sobrero , created nitroglycerin in 1846 . It is believed that he was seeking the formula for an explosive that would be stronger than gunpowder . Anyway , he found it . He compounded nitric acid , sulphuric acid and glycerin inspecified quantities , and the resultant liquid , resembling maple sirup in appearance , was considered a chemical rarity , and for nearly twenty years it was not applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alfred B. Nobel , and in Paris , in association with his father , Nobel perfected a system of manufacturing nitroglycerin and called the liquid Nobel 's Blasting Oil . It was manufactured on a commercial scale in Heleneborg , Sweden , in 1862 , but when Nobel found that it could not be transported safely he mixed nitro with an inert and shock-absorbing material , thus giving the world dynamite  --  an industrial explosive of great value and one endowed with a certain degree of safety to those who handled it . A little nitroglycerin was early used experimentally as a medicine , something to be administered as a last resort . James G. Blaine was given a few drops while on his deathbed . In minute , unexplosive quantities , nitroglycerin pills are sometimes prescribed by physicians today for those suffering from angina pectoris . The pill , held under the tongue , relieves the excruciating pain by relaxing the heart cramp . Nitroglycerin 's unusual explosive qualities were forcefully illustrated in the mid-1800 's when a small consignment of it exploded on a New York dock as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotland sank in a heavy gale oft Sandy Hook , but the hulk remained a menace to navigation until a jug of nitro was lowered against I he iron sides and exploded . The ship collapsed and was gone beneath the water instantly . This established beyond doubt that nitroglycerin was the most powerful explosive then known to man , a position it has since relinquished only to atomic energy . Besides being the principal constituent of dynamite , it is also contained in certain propellent and rocket powders . It packs a tremendous wallop . In 1864 , the oil industry was only five years of age , and confined to Pennsylvania , and it was our new industry . There were no technicians . There were no experts , no doctors to tell the industry how to cure a common complaint . The oilfield people knew what caused the trouble , but how to cure it was something that eluded their ingenuity . Paraffin , a waxy deposit , they had discovered , clogged the veins and fissures of the oil sands , preventing the free flow of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tried many things , including dosing the wells with copious quantities of benzine , a waste product from the refineries , which were then largely engaged in making lubricating oils and kerosene oil . They also tried soda and other caustic agents . In my youth , in the Eastern oil fields of Pennsylvania , Ohio and West Virginia , I knew old men who had scarred arms and hands resuiting from contact with these caustic cure-alls . Acids are still widely used to melt paraffin in some oil fields , but can be used only under special circumstances . The dilution of the crude oil with acid normally means that the oil must be filtered or purified before it can enter the pipe lines for transshipment to the refinery . They tried shooting steam down to the oil sand through a pipe . None of the remedies helped much . A half dozen or more men had exploded jugs or canisters of gunpowder against the clogged and incrusted oil sands , and this helped a little , but only momentarily . The industry frantically sought a cure for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the industry would die . The stage setting was perfect for the dramatic entrance of a rescuer . He came , in the person of Col. E. A. L. Roberts , a tall , grim-faced man who looked rather like General Sherman . In November of 1864 , he had filed letters of application for a patent on a method of increasing the flow of oil wells by using an explosive " in connection with superincumbent fluid-tamping . " In 1865 he came to Titusville , Pennsylvania , where the oil industry had started six years previously . He knew what he wanted to do , and he went about his business in secrecy and with a great calmness . He quietly constructed six torpedoes . He visited Captain Mills , the owner of the famous Ladies ' Well , which was once a great oil producer , but was now nearly dead of paraffin strangulation . No one knows what arguments Roberts used , but Mills reluctantly consented to permit him to experiment on the Ladies ' Well . In the midst of a blizzard that swept down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was filled with gunpowder ? into the drilled hole and anchored it snugly against the oil sand . Everyone else ran as Roberts dropped the go-devil to explode the charge  --  the charge having been previously well covered with water . He walked briskly from the derrick just as the few oilmen assembled to watch the experiment heard a faint explosion , minor and disappointing in character . The casing head belched mightily , and a flow of water rose steadily with a great roar . Then came a literal storm of oil , sand and gravel , a column that mounted and topped the derrick . The wind caught the spray , and the snow was smudged and discolored for hundreds of yards . The crowd hurried back to the derrick and watched while the hole was cleaned out and the wellwas put to pumping . Out of the lead line gushed oil , and the Ladies ' Well was producing at a rate of more than ten times what it had previously produced . Captain Mills danced for joy , slapped Roberts on the back and told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , which was true . Roberts ' smile was fleeting . He was not the sort of man you slapped on the back . He reminded Captain Mills and the oilmen who had witnessed the experiment that he would soon be in a position to shoot all their ailing oil wells with the Roberts torpedo . " At a price you will not find unreasonable , " he said primly as he headed into the storm to return to town . Within a couple of weeks , the Roberts Torpedo Company had opened offices ; a magazine for the storage of gunpowder and nitroglycerin had been excavated in the side of a hill a few miles from town . A frame structure was being built at this site , where the new explosive , nitroglycerin , would be blended . A military man , Roberts knew that a calculated risk was involved in using the unpredictable nitro , and he proposed to pioneer boldly . A harried carriage maker was engaged to make a wagon to the liking of Colonel Roberts and in accordance with his specifications : it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rear which was to be felt-lined and divided into cells for the presumably safe transportation of gallon cans over rough oilcountry roads . Men were hired , and the grim-faced Colonel Roberts told them how to mix nitro and how to exercise the greatest possible care in the handling of it . They were told how to shoot an oil well . A tinsm it h went to work ( Continued from Page 77 ) the car left where the tide would cover all traces of its presence ; her bloody dress destroyed . But instead of Dake 's being in jail , to be convicted of murder , his articles discredited , Onalee 's appointment confirmed , Dake was back at Arnfinn , his gray eyes watching Onalee . Onalee did not like it . She had thought by killing George Nedder to end her problems , once and for all . Instead , with two murders there was just twice as much chance of discovery . And this time it had not been like poisoning Cullen . Knocking a man 's head in was not pleasant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she wanted to forget it , all of it , to become the senator , to go to Washinton . And I will be the senator . I will . Dake was n't in the clear . He had had to throw his coat away because of the blood . He had washed his shirt and the blood spot on his pants , but the traces would still show . All she had to do was connect him with the crime . Before this , some people might have believed his story . But now nobody would . There was a commotion in the hall outside the study . Onalee opened the door in time to see Dake come running from the telephone in the butler 's pantry . Kim was leaning uncertainly against the wall , as if about to faint . Dake helped her to the nearest couch  --  the green leather one in Onalee 's study . Bram Moon appeared , also to hover over her . Kim lay there , her color perfect , only her voice indicating the faintness which Onalee was positive was assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe something stimulating . Like a Martini . " Even Dake looked puzzled at this , for though Kim drank occasionally with THE MOST DANGEROUS JOB IN THE WORLD ( Continued from Page 27 ) making shells  --  containers of tin which were to be lowered into the well to be shot , and lengths of anchor tube which could be adjusted to bring the shell to repose against the area to be shot . When oil producers came to the office , they found that the redoubtable colonel had tacked a schedule of rates to his door . They read these rates aloud and went away cursing Roberts , saying that the rates were outrageous and that Roberts was a gouger , a crook and a robber . As a matter of actual fact , the rates were not unreasonable , considering the risk involved in the work and the benefits that might come to the well owner . They averaged about $200 for a normal shot , but the sum seemed unreasonable to men engaged in a bitter fight to keep their new industry going . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , accepted the tariff and had their wells shot . A dry hole on the Flood farm was shot , and it responded by producing eighty barrels of oil a day . That rather tipped the scales , and soon the Roberts Torpedo Company was doing a rousing business . Then , suddenly , business fell off . The " moonlighters " had appeared out of nowhere and were doing business in complete disregard of the Roberts patent . Roberts engaged scouts and detectives . Things started to happen.the rest of them , she had never before been known to ask for a drink . All right , Onalee thought . We 'll play this out to the end . Because I want to see what she 's up to . Onalee not only kept her temper ; she managed a solicitous smile . She went out to the dining room , listening , as Dake had asked her to , for the ring which would indicate that Dake 's call to Boston had been completed on the phone in the butler 's pantry . When Onalee returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she was sitting on the edge of the couch . After she took the cocktail glass , she even rose and moved about the room . Onalee sat watching her . Kim was behind the desk now , talking , her back to the doorway where Dake leaned , listening for his call . Kim facing Onalee and Bram , talking rapidly , gaily , about nothing in particular . Too rapidly . Too gaily . Kim standing , glass in hand , behind Cullen 's desk , still talking , and watching Onalee and Bram . Onalee met her eyes blandly . But Bram , looking at the desk , became progressively more uneasy . Onalee reached out to put a firm hand on his writhing knee . She could sense his inward excitement , his fear . So could Kim . For it was at Bram she looked , not Onalee , as she raised her glass and finally drank the Martini . " This drink , " she said faintly . " It smells so funny . Something . . . I 've smelled before . Bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She swayed a little , steadied herself on the desk , then slumped to the floor in a boneless heap . Bram was on his feet , rushing heavily across the room . He screamed the words at Onalee , " You 've killed her ! You 've killed her just the way you did Cullen ! " ( TO BE CONTINUED ) Moonlighters. so called because they operated secretly only on moonlit nights , would hastily mix up a batch of nitro in a wooden tub , pour it into a pair of ten-quart cans , place the cans in a meal sack , sling the sack across their shoulders and start out to shoot a well remotely located in the rough and hilly country . Their rates were about one half those charged by the Roberts Torpedo Company . The moonlighters were carefully watched by Roberts ' men . Once in a while , a man carrying the cans would stumble over a root or turn an ankle on a round stone . There would be a red flash , and a terrific explosion would rend the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How many deaths occurred in what the oil industry casually called The Moonlighters ' War is difficult to estimate . The immediate cause of the deaths was easy to tabulate  --  an explosion of nitroglycerin . But , it was darkly rumored , a bullet striking a can of nitro could have caused the explosion . Roberts ' spies were frequently charged with firing such shots , but the charges were never proved . The hills in the Pennsylvania oil fields were once dotted with hollows marking places where adventuresome moonlighters had met a sudden and lonely death . The spies sent in detailed reports on the men who managed to reach the well to be shot , and enough evidence was collected to convict them and the owners of the well for infringement of the Roberts patent . Within a matter of a year , more than 2000 civil suits were instituted in the courts of Pennsylvania . In most instances the plaintiff was Colonel Roberts , suing for patent infringement ; in others , groups of oil producers contested the validity of the patent . Each case eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in connection with superincumbent fluid-tamping . " It was readily proved that other men had been using an explosive of some kind to increase the flow of oil long before Roberts appeared on the scene . But those who had the foresight to patent their processes had neglected to insert any magic words in regard to the use of superincumbent fluid-tamping ; in reality , the infringement occurred at the well to be shot , merely by the introduction of the fluidtamping . The fluid-tamping was the real secret of the success of the Roberts torpedo . This fluid-tamping consisted of water poured to a point well above the top of the shell . The water directed the force of the initial explosion downward and sideward , opening the fissures in the oil sand and creating new ones before the full force of the explosion sent the water gushing from the casing head . In the course of the battle over the patent , which was renewed in 1873 , the Roberts organization did not lose a court decision . It was inevitable that Colonel Roberts should have become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was generated  --  that of oil-well shooter . As Roberts tightened his hold on the oil industry and expanded to every known oil field , all manner of men applied for jobs . Some were old men , unfitted for the work . A few were derelicts who had come from oil-boom-town bars , men with shaky hands , desperate for any type of job that would provide their families with food , themselves with drink . Others ? the only kind Roberts would hire ? were sober men , keenly aware of the danger of working with nitro . Into these men Roberts tried to drill an alertness that had to be kept alive every second a man was near nitro glycerin . Yet , with all of the vigilance exercised , accidents happened , and men and horses had their lives suddenly snuffed out . Sometimes the nitro exploded while it was being transported to the well , for the roads were rough , littered with stumps and deeply rutted . Once in a while , the nitro exploded while being poured into the shells at the well itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside was rocked with the force of the explosion . Yet , when a man was killed , there was always a surplus of iron-nerved men eager to take over the job . The wages , it is true , were higher than oil-field wages , but the danger was ever present . Many shooters suffered acutely from headaches caused by the fumes of the nitro after it had been exploded . The pain from such a headache is difficult to describe , aside from the fact that it is almost unbearable . You never can tell about nitro . I 've seen a photograph of a truck that had been filled with cans of nitro , which skidded and rolled down a long hill , strewing the load all over the landscape . No explosion ! My friend , Augie Bond , careful and intelligent , drove through Pleasantville , Pennsylvania , over a smooth road , on March 11 , 1936 , and it happened . And what happened to him has happened to hundreds of other shooters , sober men , men without nerves , careful in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sifted sand pumpings into a go-devil shell partially filled with nitro . At the time , a go-devil consisted of a stick of dynamite incased in the heavy tin of the go-devil and equipped with a firing pin on the lower end . Patton found he had no dynamite in his equipment box and decided to make his own dynamite by mixing sand pumpings and nitro . It was a grave error . A red blast shook the countryside , and Patton was gone . The first thing an oil-country man does when he starts to the place where ( Continued from Page 80 ) there has been an explosion is to look for a cigar box to take with him . The cigar box is usually more than sufficient to hold the recoverable remains of the victim . Col. E. A. L. Roberts died on March 25 , 1881 . He had had a distinguished war record in the War of 1812 and in the Civil War . The explosion of a shell in a millpond at Fredericksburg gave him the idea for the fluid-tamping , he once testified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fredericksburg . He had been a manufacturing dentist in New York , where he was in business with his brother , W. B. Roberts . He was credited with several inventions in the field of dentistry and had been awarded a medal for his contributions to the progress of the industry . He was a proud man , acutely aware of the heritage of hate which he had generated . In the year before his death he had spent more than $125,000 in litigation . His luck was unfailing ; the courts never once decided against him . Millions had accrued to him as a result of his monopoly and , toward the end , most oil producers , weary of court battles and legal expense , bowed meekly and paid the fees he adjudged to be proper . A few die-hards contested the validity of the patent to the end . The colonel 's brother , W. B. Roberts , carried on after his death . He , too , looked something like Sherman , but was slightly more friendly than the colonel . Colonel Roberts was buried at Titusville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes a replica of a torpedo in bronze . The colonel was an honest man and upright in his dealings . At times he could be generous . The families of shooters who died by reason of nitro testified to his liberality . But when it came to his patent , he was adamant against infringement , as a matter of habit and principle . The day he was buried , oilmen celebrated in boomtown bars , in obscure enginehouses and in dozens of remote and shabby oil-field boardinghouses . Men who had smarted under the sting of court decisions , men who had been ruined by judgments that ruthlessly absorbed their meager capital , were unabashedly happy to hear of his death . There are still oil-well shooters . They differ but little from their counterparts of Roberts ' day . Their wagons are trucks which are equipped with special springs and special brakes . Outside of that , there is n't any material change . Perhaps the mortality rate is a little lower than it once was , but there are those who will argue the point heatedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a silent man , little given to talk . He lives a lonely life . No hitchhiker ever begs for a ride when he sees the word NITROGLYCERIN painted in big letters on the side of the truck . Some shooters are married , but most girls are chary of marrying a shooter . No insurance company will accept them as a risk . All of them dream of retirement . Yet , in my experience of the oil fields , I 've known of only one man who actually did retire . They go along their silent ways , staying away from drink and checking and cross-checking conditions at the magazine where they load their truck . They walk carefully , with a gallon can in each hand . They slide the cans slowly and carefully into the individual cells , after first inspecting each carefully for leakage . At the well , they cautiously remove the corks from the cans , knowing that just a little friction may be too much . They keep their eyes glued on the road as they drive , watching for ruts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after every trip , because a can may spring a leak in transit . Even a few drops seeping into a cell unnoticed may be sufficient to cause an explosion on the next trip ; a can rubbing against the impregnated surface of the lining or jolting against it could bring disaster . Yet one day they will probably make one mistake , a single error . Maybe a cork twisted too sharply , possibly an unavoidable stumble . Maybe the brakes of the truck will jam or slip going down a long , rough * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * hill . Maybe something will happen that was never known as a hazard before . Then it comes ! And in some nearby city or town the heavy rumble comes , then the rush of air that pushes and pulls savagely , breaks windows , tosses people around and frightens the youngsters . People pop out of their houses and gather in quiet curious groups . They know what has happened . Where ? To whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the story . But they never know the how . Later that day a new truck , with a new driver at the wheel , drives past the place where the explosion took place . The driver waves to a friend . A well is waiting to be shot . Not all of the accidents end on a note of tragedy . Up in Bradford , Pennsylvania , about fifteen years ago , they were ready to shoot a well . The nitro had been poured , the shell had been lowered into the hole , the requisite amount of fluid-tamping had gone down the casing head . The shooter had driven his truck to a place of safety and was readying the go-devil . A sinister gurgling sound came from the casing head ? the well was about to start flowing . In a matter of seconds the big shell , filled with sixty quarts of nitroglycerin , would shoot from the casing head and smash against the walking beam . The drillers and the tool dressers turned and ran  --  all but one , a fat driller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He realized it was too late , that he was too fat to run . He clenched his teeth , moved over to the casing head , made a circle of his arms , stood there  --  and prayed ! The loaded shell spurted into sight . He shut his eyes , brought his arms together and clutched the shell firmly . Carefully , as though walking on eggs , he retreated slowly , completely covered with oil . He stood the shell up safely in the corner of the derrick floor , broke into a wavering grin , stepped carefully away from the derrick ? and kept on stepping . When questioned about his intentions , he said briefly that he proposed to go to the bar of the Emery Hotel and stand there and drink and drink until he fell down . My father , an apprentice shooter , once worked with George Van Vliet , a famous and a very careful shooter . One day on a job , Van started to pour nitro into a shell when a capricious wind caught the liquid and sprayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his feet never moved . The shell was lowered into place . Then he called to my father to unlace the shoes , and he stepped out of them . He then called for hot water from the boiler , and the floor of the derrick and the shoes were thoroughly drenched . He removed his socks and dropped them into the water , then stepped back and supervised the interment of the shoes in a five-foot hole dug by the drilling crew . The shoes were carefully lowered on the end of a string , and respectfully and gently covered with dirt . Then Van grinned and had my father fix and fetch the go-devil . He dropped it into place , skipped nimbly back to the wagon and climbed up on the seat . When the desired explosion had taken place , he handed the reins to my father and moved over in the seat . " Figure I might have a little trouble with the brakes in my bare feet , " he confessed . My father drove back to town proudly , but grandmother heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on for several years , quit and stayed quit  --  the only shooter I have ever known who did it . In the early days of the oil fields , a budding journalist in a moment of genius wrote a piece that has been widely copied . Rouseville furnished the latest unpatented novelty in connection with Nitro-Glycerine . A torpedoman took a small parcel of the dangerous compound from the magazine , and on his return he dropped into the enginehouse for a few minutes , leaving the vessel beside the door . A rampant hog in search of a real Christmas dinner discovered the tempting package and unceremoniously devoured the entire contents , finishing the last atom as the torpedoist turned from the building ! Now everybody gives the greedy animal the widest latitude . It has possession of the whole sidewalk whenever disposed to promenade . All the town dogs have been placed in solitary confinement , or fear that they might chase the loaded porker against a post . No one is sufficiently reckless to kick the critter , lest it should unexpectedly explode and send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter is really becoming serious , and how to dispose safely of the gormandizing swine is the great conundrum of the hour . When he is killed and ground up into sausages and headcheese , a new terror will be added to the long list that boardinghouses already possess . What finally happened , the scribe did not say . The oil industry has always been able to laugh at danger , even when it 's housed in nitroglycerin . But it 's always a respectful laugh .
