 | What we Now Know About Skidding The weather was clear , the road good , traffic light . The car was new , and the driver said , " I 'm gon na see what this job can do . " What it did was break away on an unbanked curve . That driver did n't know enough about skidding . The road was not icy or even wet . But he did n't match his high speed against road grip and centrifugal force on a flat curve . And he did n't consider what would happen if a wheel hopped on a bump or pebble . So he 's dead . ( His passengers told the story . ) You can skid on any road , in any weather . You probably have . The important point is : Lots of things can be done to prevent it . Some involve driving techniques , road and the design of the car . Now iteappears cthat many of them will be done . A file-full of technical papers presented recently at the First International Skid Prevention Conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cooking . ? Tricks for handling wheel and brakes in slippery weather are being pinned down by careful tests . ? Tires that grip better , even on ice , will be on sale next year . ? Brakes that can prevent skids are now in prospect . ? A warning signal ? light or buzzer ? to red-flag you just before @# @#  | the wheels slew sideways is another likely accessory . o Sandpaper-surface roads will be common . Special treatments that make roadtops stickier yet are already being used on bridges and skid-causing curves . Skidding accidents are increasing . In Virginia , skidding was involved in 41 percent of all accidents in 1957 , against 35 percent the previous year . In England , where careful records go back many years , skidding accidents have risen steadily . ( Probable reason : faster cars on faster roads . ) The figures on wintertime accidents on the Pennsylvania Turnpike show how serious a hazard skid conditions pose . When the Turnpike was icy , the passenger-car accident rate leaped to more than five times normal . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the road and the tires keeps the tires from slipping ? they roll on the road . This friction goes down , way down , if something separates your tires from the road ? the tire surface no longer touches the road surface solidly . The something can be a bump that lifts the wheels off the ground . Most often , though , it 's water ( from rain or melted ice ) . A thin film coats the road , acting as a lubricant between the tire and road surface . Other liquids occasionally cause trouble ? oil bleeding from asphalt pavement , for instance . One time out West , juice from millions of mashed locusts triggered a slither of skidding accidents . The difference a little water makes is fantastic . ? On dry concrete , you can stop in around 20 feet from 20 m.p.h . ? On wet concrete , you need around 30 feet ( 50 percent more ) at 20 m.p.h . ? On wet ice , you need between 200 and 250 feet ! Why you skid sideways . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The road-tire friction has to be strong enough to resist centrifugal force : if it is n't , the car just takes off , wheels sliding . The sideways skid on a turn is n't such a shock as a slew or spin when you 're bouncing merrily straight ahead or braking for a stop . That happens because the road-tire forces are never quite the same at all four wheels ? at each point of contact the road is a little different , the tires are a little different , braking action is a little different . This imbalance means that the total force is greater on one side of the car than the other , and that makes the car twist around its center when it slips . You ca n't steer when you skid because a sliding wheel moves just as easily one way as another . What you can do . People in Alaska , Saskatchewan and Maine do n't put their cars up on blocks for the winter any more , and they do n't all drive like your maiden aunt , either . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experts : 1 . Rein your reflexes . You ca n't automatically twist the wheel or slam the brakes , the way you usually do , to squeak out of a tight spot . That can be exactly the wrong move . This is hard to remember , yet it 's the most important trick . 2 . Keep all your senses alert . Look for slick pavement where you do n't expect it or where it is extra dangerous ( at turns and intersections ) . Feel with a safecracker 's fingers and a tightrope walker 's toes for feedback clues from wheel , brake and accelerator . They can warn of loss of control . And do n't ignore your stomach ? there 's a special deep-in-the-guts sensation that tells you just as you start to go sideways .  | 3 . Match your speed to the available friction for turning and accelerating as well as stopping . Every action must be gradual , which means you have to give yourself space to maneuver. 4 . Start your turns tight , the way a racing driver does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels break away . 5 . Break as hard as you can without locking the wheels . On ice , try " fanning " @#  | ? fast brake-pumping that locks and unlocks the wheels . Some experts think this can shorten stopping distance by 15 percent and keep the car steerable. 6 . Beware of one bald tire or uneven brakes . Such tricks are second nature to good drivers in cold-weather areas . But over most of the U.S. , bad skid conditions are so infrequent that most drivers lack the chance to perfect special skills . Their inexperience leads them into trouble . This accident ( a real one ) is typical : Four cars are feeling their way along an icy , four-lane expressway . Number two decides to pull out and pass . But he 's too rough with the steering wheel or the accelerator . He spins . Number three could edge off onto the shoulder . He should . But he fails to control his reflexes , and hits the brakes instead . He slides into number two . Number four makes exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice shows up in the statistics . On the Pennsylvania Turnpike , truckdrivers get into a few more accidents in slippery weather , but the increase is nothing like the fivefold change recorded for passenger-car drivers . Tires that stop skidding . Whatever your skill and experience , the right tires help a lot . An amazing amount of skid resistance can be built into them , although chains , particularly reinforced chains , are still best for the roughest going . The basic idea is simple : The tire should push away the very thin film of water coating the roadway to restore the high friction of **30;156;TOOLONG contact . That is what the tread is supposed to do : Its edges wipe the water out through the grooves . @# This applies to ice-coated as well as rain-coated pavement . Ice is slipperiest when coated with water ( often melted by the pressure of the tires ) . In snow , deep tire grooves improve traction by meshing with the snow itself . A perfectly smooth tread is the worst kind it traps the water film inside the tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Safety Council show that good mud-snow treads improve braking performance on ice by 22 percent ( over regular road tires ) . And better designs are in the works . One maker is now testing a tire that promises a 50-percent gain in skid resistance . These remarkable improvements come almost entirely from tread design . The basic construction of the tire does n't seem to affect skid resistance one way or another . And until recently , the kind of rubber in the tire seemed relatively unimportant . But now a physicist at Cambridge University in England , D. Tabor , has come up with a radical idea . He thinks the way to cut skidding is to use the " wrong " rubber in tires . Ordinarily , tire engineers avoid rubber that heats up quickly from internal friction when it flexes ( they call this " hysteresis loss " ) . The heat wrecks the rubber . But Tabor 's experiments show that this destructive internal friction is the source of most of rubber 's resistance to sliding . Here is how he explains it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road dig temporary grooves in the rubber . It takes work to plow these grooves . This work comes from the force making the wheel slide , and is used up in @#  | @# heating the rubber . The greater amount of heat developed , the greater work done , and the greater the f needed . So rubber that heats up e will require a very large force to keep sliding . It would make a tire with resistance to skidding . Tabor proposes two ways to get are the very practical objection that s tires might wear out from overheat ' before you got a chance to try their s resistance : 1 . Use the quick-heating rubber o for the tread , slow-heating rubber e where . 2 . Make the tire narrow , to reduce t amount of rubber flexed ( and the h generated ) in normal rolling . ( Wh diameter would have to be increased to provide enough contact with the road . ) Brakes that stop skids . General Motors , Ford and Bendix ( a major brake supplier ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of them will talk about it . However , Dunlop Rubber Company , the British tire outfit , has also made one , and reported on it in detail . The idea is simple : To skid , the wheel has to stop rolling . The anti-skid brake would never let that happen . The instant the wheel began to stop rolling , the brake would go off . As soon as the wheel began rolling again , the brake would go on again . This system would make brake pressure go on and off very rapidly ? automatic fanning , in effect . You would get maximum braking effort just short of locked wheels , and you could always steer . British Government tests of the Dunlop " Maxaret " ( on a Jaguar Mark VII equipped with double-pad disk brakes ) proved this out . The car remained steerable , and stopping distances on wet pavement were reduced as much as 18 percent . In this country , Prof. Archie Easton of the University of Wisconsin , who is chairman of the Safety Council 's Committee on Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ice of Pine Lake . This was a Finnish development , still experimental . It worked by releasing the rear brakes whenever the front wheels locked . Professor Easton told POPULAR SCIENCE : " It showed up very well ? even stop-  | ping a skid after one had started . But trouble with all these things is t they 're complicated and expensive . " Stickier roads . A quarter-century of search has shown how to make pavem do its part in preventing skids . The ideal turns out to be a surface li sandpaper , made up of many very sm and very sharp projections . The p jections catch in rubber to give a tig grip . They have to be sharp so that the can break through the film of water tha causes slipperiness . They have to small and numerous to leave many little " valleys " that will drain skid-producing water away . Both asphalt and concrete will make surfaces like that if mixed properly . One problem , though , is keeping that sandI paper roughness . The gravel and sand most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Traffic quickly polishes limestone so smooth that it is slippery even when dry . ( In Virginia . three counties that use limestone hay e twice as many skidding accidents as the other counties . ) The remedies are usually expensive natural sand or gravel aggregates or special thin coatings of sharp sand or aluminum-oxide abrasive mixed in plastic or asphalt-rubber latex . The tricks that do n't work . Like all folklore , the skid talk you hear at the grease rack is half truth , half fancy . Scientists have checked out both kinds . Some ancient and honorable skid preventives that have been disproved : ? Soft tires . Recommended pressure or higher shortens stopping distance and improves cornering on glare ice . Lower pressure ( by seven to nine pounds ) does help you start from a standstill . ? Manual transmission . In a Safety Council test , the automatic hydraulic transmission provided 30 percent more pull . ( A limited-slip differential definitely helps . ) ? Anti-skid gimmicks . The Safety Council tested one : a 50-pound weight centered inside a tube by springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to prevent sideslip . It did n't . There are other ideas that do n't work , but fortunately , still more that do . And new ones are coming up as scientists spur research into this driving hazard . @#
