MINIVER CHEEVY <P> Miniver Cheevy , child of scorn , <P> Grew lean while he assailed the seasons ; <P> He wept that he was ever born , And he had reasons . <P> <P> Miniver loved the days of old <P> When swords were bright and steeds were prancing ; The vision of a warrior bold <P> Would set him dancing . <P> Miniver sighed for what was not , <P> And dreamed , and rested from his labors , <P> He dreamed of Thebes and Camelot , And Priam 's neighbors . <P> Miniver mourned the ripe renown <P> That made so many a name so fragrant ; <P> He mourned Romance , now on the town , And Art , a vagrant . <P> Miniver loved the Medici , <P> Albeit he had never seen one ; He would have sinned incessantly <P> Could he have been one . <P> Miniver cursed the commonplace <P> And eyed a khaki suit with loathing ; He missed the medieval grace <P> Of iron clothing . <P> Miniver scorned the gold he sought , <P> But sore annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thought , <P> And thought about it . <P> Miniver Cheevy , born too late , <P> Scratched his head and kept on thinking ; <P> Miniver coughed , and called it fate , And kept on drinking . <P> <P> NEW ENGLAND <P> Here where the wind is always north-north-east <P> And children learn to walk on frozen toes , <P> Wonder begets an envy of all those <P> Who boil elsewhere with such a lyric yeast <P> Of love that you will hear them at a feast <P> Where demons would appeal for some repose , <P> Still clamoring where the chalice overflows <P> And crying wildest who have drunk the least . <P> Passion is here a soilure of the wits , <P> We 're told , and Love a cross for them to bear ; <P> Joy shivers in the corner where she knits And Conscience always has the rocking-chair , <P> Cheerful as when she tortured into fits <P> The first cat that was ever killed by Care . <P> <P> RICHARD CORY <P> Whenever Richard Cory went down town , <P> We people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman from sole to crown , <P> Clean favored , and imperially slim . <P> <P> And he was always quietly arrayed , <P> And he was always human when he talked ; <P> But still he fluttered pulses when he said , <P> " Good-morning , " and he glittered when he walked . <P> And he was rich-yes , richer than a king- <P> And admirably schooled in every grace : <P> In fine , we thought that he was everything <P> To make us wish that we were in his place . <P> So on we worked , and waited for the light , <P> And went without the meat , and cursed the bread ; <P> And Richard Cory , one calm summer night , <P> Went home and put a bullet through his head . <P> <P> From Collected Poems of Edwin Arlington Robinson , Macmillan ( 1937 ) .
