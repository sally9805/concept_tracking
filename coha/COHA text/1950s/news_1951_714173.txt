txt The question is being discussed here whether Britain should proceed with its general election scheduled for Oct. 25 in view of two factors  --  first the unifying effect on the whole nation of King George VI 's present condition ; second . the acute new overseas trade , especially the dollar trade , crisis which once again threatens the whole British economy . Already , according to one of Britain 's most responsible political commentators , A. J. Cummings of the liberal News Chronicle , the King 's illness has taken whatever life there was out of the opening phases of the election . " It is true that the latest news from Buckingham Palace is encouraging . Most up-to-date bulletins tell how " the King has gained strength . " Reluctance Evident But it is equally true that while anxiety continues there is a feeling of reluctance to launch into the turmoil of party battle . In view of the fact that the . polling day is only a month hence , the battle would normally be expected to be fierce . When all three main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Liberal Clement Davies joined together in an all-party expression of sympathy for the King , it put the idea into a good many person 's heads , " It 's a pity they ca n't show the same unity in the face of the nation 's other troubles . " For besides the question of the King , there is another shadow over Britain 's preelection scene . If it were not for the very nature of the first shadow  --  rousing spontaneous affection of people for a much-loved sovereign  --  that second shadow would be even more overbearing . Fiscal Crisis Grows Once again the British are face to face with a critical economic situation . This situation has worsened rapidly and amounts at the moment to Britain 's overspending 1 at the expense of other coup , tries to the amount of about ? 400,000,000 sterling a year . That is a situation caused part ; by rearmament expenditure am ; partly by . the terms of the trade that is continuing to go against Britain ? in other words , food and raw material prices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Exchequer Hugh Gaitskell is understood to have found no clear remedy in Washington . Marshall Plan aid has ended , and the dollar gap yawns as wide as ever . In the face of such twofold trouble which hangs over this country , it is asked should the nation be plunged into party warfare ? Could not Messrs . Attlee , Churchill , and Davies stand together in the battle for economic salvation , just as they have in love for the King ? Suggestions for a coalition government and a truce to party politics have come from the United States . But this matter of ending party politics is easier said than done . In fact , it seems that party politics are the hallmark of a lively democracy . However heavily current criti-. cal troubles bear on the:British people , they know they have to find an answer to them . What is the answer ? How to enable this country to pay its way ? That is precisely where the parties differ on the remedies . They differ fundamentally . Mandate Needed ? As a parliamentary ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Commons clutch at the summer recess . It seemed a Parliament which - above all needed a new mandate to . do justice to itself . That is the other side of the picture in the debate over whether Britain should continue with its election plans . There seems some likelihcod that the circumstances of the election will engender in it a greater restraint and greater sense of responsibility . Mr. Attlee and his rebel former Minister of Health , Aneurin Bevan , already have buried the natchet in interests of Labor unity in the election campaign . This was decided at a meeting pf the national executive of the ' Labor Party in London Sept. 24 . This particular hatchet. however , remains a very live one , all ? eady to be dug up again at a monent 's . notice . It is a fundamental hatchet on which depends whether the Labor Party in future goes with Mr. Attlee to the right or with Mr. Bevan to the left .                  @ @ @
