INDOCHINA <P> A French Red Cross helicopter clattered out of a slate-grey sky , and put down at Dienbienphu . Two khaki-clad officers and an angular French civilian stepped gingerly down to the muddy , shell-torn airstrip , and a Communist liaison officer came forward to greet them . " You are one hour ahead of schedule , messieurs , " said the Communist . " You should know that our Democratic Republic 's time is one hour behind your own . Now , if you will please follow me . " The French had come back to Dienbienphu to settle terms for evacuating their 1,500 wounded , as vouchsafed by the Communists at Geneva . <P> The little party moved off beneath a new Communist victory arch to three conference tents at the end of the runway . The Communists offered the Frenchmen tea with sugar , and Lucky Strikes . " They were very polite , " said the helicopter pilot . " All they wanted was to be treated as soldiers according to their rank . But we did n't think very much about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the wind kicked up , we could smell the death around us . " <P> Decision in a Tent . The conference began . The French civilian , Dean Pierre Huard of Hanoi University 's Medical School , first asked the Communists how many wounded prisoners they would release . " Four hundred and fifty to start with , " replied a Communist doctor . " And 250 of these are serious cases . " Asked Dr. Huard : " What about the Vietnamese soldiers you captured ? " Replied a Communist colonel : " We want them to have a correct appreciation of the realities . " <P> What were the Red conditions for the release ? Said the colonel : " We want you to cease all air attacks within a radius of six miles of the Dienbienphu valley , and also along 70 miles of Route Coloniale 41 between Dienbienphu and Sonla . We use this road to evacuate our wounded and your own healthy prisoners of war . " <P> It so happened that Route Coloniale 41 was Red General Giap 's direct line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Huard apparently accepted the Red terms without question . That night the French army radio put out this note of appreciation : " The delegates of the French high command thank the delegates of the Viet people 's army for their humanitarian concern . " And the Communists seemed just as friendly next day when they helped load the first eleven wounded into a couple of French helicopters : " We hope you will remember what we have done for you . We hope this war will end very soon . Now au revoir . " But the eleven wounded men of Dienbienphu " were rath er hostile " to the Communist speechmakers , said one who was there , and the helicopters quickly took off .
