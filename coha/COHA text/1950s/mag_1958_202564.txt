" Can it ever be forgotten what a racket was made with the Citizen Gent ? " wrote a Pennsylvanian about the tour of the U.S. put on by the French revolutionary republic 's new ambassador in 1793 . " What hugging and tugging ! What addressing and caressing ! With liberty caps and the other wretched trumpery of sans culotte foolery ! " But President George Washington soon had his fill of Citizen Gent 's pleading with the American people for U.S. help to France over the heads of the U.S. Government , and the nuisance he was making of himself trying to kick up an expedition of American adventurers against the U.S. 's Spanish neighbors in Florida . Thundered the President : " What must the world think of such conduct and the government of the United States in submitting to it ? " He called in his Cabinet and decided to demand Gent 's recall as persona non grata . <P> Last week the U.S. Government 's patience was running out on another hugand-tug type of foreign diplomat in Washington .

Menshikov smilingly promised to look into the matter , did nothing . Last week the State Department let it be known that the U.S. 's final recourse in such a matter might be to declare such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it happened , Ambassador Gene 's fate was far from cruel . Things were so rough and unpredictable back in revolutionary France in 1793 that Citizen Gent , fearing death by guillotine , asked Washington if he could stay on in the U.S. as Private Citizen Gent . Washington 's response : O.K. So Genet retired quietly to New York State , there wed the daughter of Governor De Witt Clinton , let the Revolution go by as he lived out his life with a big smile .
