The Rchling family is to the steel-rich Saar what the Fords are to Dearborn , Mich . Longtime producers of one-third of the Saar 's steel , the Rchlings hold the key to the basin 's rich economy , the deciding weight in the industrial balance of power between France and Germany . Both in 1919 and 1946 , France took over the Rchling empire in an effort to swallow the Saar . Just 20 months ago Foreign Minister Antoine Pinay promised the French Senate , " The Rchlings will never return to the Saar . " But six months after he spoke , the German-speaking Saarlanders voted down a French attempt to link their economies permanently . <P> This week France admitted the defeat of its hopes for economic control of the Saar , which will be incorporated into West Germany Jan. 1 . France handed back to the Rchlings , several of them alumni of French jails as war criminals , the iron and steel works at Vlklingen , employing 14,000 workers and producing 1,000,000 tons of steel a year . <P> Divesting the Dismantler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the base of the Rchlings ' 250-year-old empire , which spills into West Germany with a coal field near Aachen , a steel business at Mannheim , an iron works at Wetzlar . The family 's real rise to power began under sword-scarred Hermann Rchling , prime mover of the Saar 's vast industrial buildup of the early 1900s . As a war mobilizer in the Kaiser 's army in World War I , Captain Rchling ordered the scrapping of French iron and steel plants in occupied areas . Later the victorious French sentenced Hermann Rchling in absentia to ten years in prison , confiscated the Rchlings ' big iron works and ore fields in Lorraine , plus 60% of their Vlklingen steel plant and some coal mines in the neighboring Saar . <P> Stripped almost clean , the Rchlings were still idolized by the Saarlanders , who remembered the family 's benevolent approach to labor , their record for holding employment steady . In the 1930s , when German and French steel plants were laying off workers , Rchling held its full labor force by falling back on reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular sympathy to achieve political leadership , Hermann Rchling cried for Anschluss with the German Fatherland . In 1935 the Saarlanders voted overwhelmingly to join Germany . <P> During World War II , Rochling bossed Lorraine 's iron and steel production plus Saarland industry . At war 's end , an Allied court found Hermann Rchling guilty of waging aggressive war , the first industrialist so convicted , jailed him for two years . After Hermann 's death at 83 last year , administration of the family empire fell to his nephew Ernst Rchling , 66 , who in 1949 had been sentenced to five years behind French barbed wire .
