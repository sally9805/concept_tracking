With the confidence and skill of a high-wire cyclist , Max Liebman each week whips together a 28-man , 1 hour musical revue called Your Show of Shows ( Sat . 9 p.m. , E.S.T. , NBC-TV ) . This week , 48-year-old Producer-Director Liebman displays his real virtuosity by riding two vehicles at once : he is putting on another 1-hour musical , the Easter special Star-Spangled Revue ( Sun . 5:30 p.m. , E.S.T. , NBC-TV ) , sponsored by Frigidaire and featuring Bob Hope , Beatrice Lillie , Dinah Shore and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , plus his own company . <P> Liebman accomplishes his production miracles by working with a veteran team , many of whom have followed him from summer theater to Broadway ( The Straw Hat Revue , Tars and Spars , Make Mine Manhattan ) , " We 're hep , " he explains . " We simplify things by avoiding too many props and cutting down on un-essentials like sound effects . We lose very little time . " <P> With hardly any waste motion behind the scenes , Liebman gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sid Caesar he has a TV-raised multi-dimensional comedian who is equally convincing as a slot machine , a head-lolling infant , a British general or a Freudian psychiatrist just off the plane from Vienna . Caesar 's comedy partner is pint-sized Imogene Coca ( " No one knows how old she is " ) , who can switch from a prim Victorian to a stripteaser to a Wagnerian Valkyrie without missing a nuance or a laugh . <P> Caesar and Coca are supported by such guest stars as Gertrude Lawrence , Rex Harrison or Jose Ferrer , and by a chorus and well-trained ballet . To " add a sprinkling of cultural items , " Liebman pairs off the Metropolitan Opera 's Baritone Robert Merrill and Soprano Marguerite Piazza , in neatly scissored scenes from light and grand opera . <P> NBC is more than satisfied with Liebman 's press notices on the Show of Shows , which have generally been raves . But the network has not yet figured out how to sell the package . At present , one half-hour is cooperatively sponsored by Swift &; Co. , RCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $40,000 weekly price tag can be met . <P> Liebman confidently expects that these financial headaches will be eased by the aspirin of top-notch entertainment . CBS has already shifted the Ed Wynn Show , the Saturday Night Revue 's strongest competitor , to Tuesdays . " We 're trying to make people feel that they 're eavesdropping on a Broadway show , " says Liebman . " I think we can do it , too . " There was only one evidence of self-doubt : " I just hope NBC does n't expect us to keep this up 52 weeks a year . " <P> <P> *NBC 's problems are further complicated by the sponsorless Jack Carter Show , an hour-long variety program telecast from Chicago ( Sat . 8 p.m. , E.S.T. , NBCTV ) and linked to Your Show of Shows under the generic name of Saturday Night Revue.
