On the morning of August 25 , 1875 , Captain Matthew Webb of Dawley , Shropshire , 27 year-old master of an English sailing vessel , woke up in a Calais hotel to find himself famous . The day before he had done the impossible : he had swum the English Channel , the first person in history to do so . While he slept that night the world heard all about him  --  how he had plunged off the Admiralty Pier at Dover and had battled currents and high seas for 21 ? hours over a 50-mile zigzag course to reach the sands at Calais . // Days of glory awaited the Shropshire lad . At Dover , where a huge throng welcomed him upon his return , the mayor of the city said , " In the future history of the world I do n't believe that any such feat will be performed by anyone else . " Webb became a national hero . Crowds mobbed him wherever he went . Dignitaries clapped him on the back . A public subscription organized by Lord Stanhope netted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal purse and handed him ? 5,000 . Thousands flocked to see the stocky 5-foot 8-inch blond captain cleave the waters with the powerful stroke that had conquered the Channel . ( Webb used the breaststroke , the crawl being then unknown . At the rate of 25 to 27 strokes a minute , he swam low in the water , with mouth and nose under , blowing porpoise-like as his head emerged. ) // Acclaimed as the world 's greatest swimmer , Webb toured English resort beaches giving swimming exhibitions and staging feats of endurance . A couple of years of this , however , and interest in him began to slacken . He became more and more of a stunt man and would pick up a few purses by betting that he could stay in the water for a certain number of hours . Once at Scarborough he won ? 400 by swimming about for 74 continuous hours . // He came to this country in 1879 and swam from Sandy Hook to Coney Island , covering 16 miles against strong tides in eight hours . Following this feat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manager named Fred Kyle . // In 1881 he reappeared in the United States to bolster his diminishing fortune , but little money came in . He won $1,000 by defeating George H. Wade of Brooklyn , " the champion ocean swimmer of America , " in a five-mile match race at Brighton Beach , near Coney Island . In Boston he remained in a tank of water for 128 ? hours ( with a 15-minute interval of rest at the end of each 24 hours ) . The stunt failed to cause much excitement and brought him no money . // In the summer of 1883 Kyle got him booked at Nantasket Beach , Mass. , to give daily exhibitions of swimming . The captain was now no longer the shining Shropshire lad who had brought fame to England eight years before . At 35 he weighed 200 pounds , and his closely cropped hair was thin on top . With him at Nantasket , where he was no great attraction , lived his wife and their two small children . // What was needed , Manager Kyle thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that no man had ever tried before . Like the Niagara River rapids below the falls , for instance  --  perhaps the angriest stretch of water on earth . If Webb could get through them he would again have done the impossible , and there would be a fortune in it . // A GORGE OF BOILING WATER // At the foot of Niagara Falls there is a huge circular gorge of constantly boiling water . The Niagara River empties out of the gorge and is relatively quiet for a brief stretch . Then , about two miles below the falls , it gathers momentum as the walls of the river close in . Through this ever-narrowing funnel a tremendous volume of water , wild for want of room , reaches a pace of nearly 30 miles an hour and throws the surface into a series of great billows that break up to 30 feet high . These are the Whirlpool Rapids , some three-quarters of a mile in length , and below them is the Whirlpool itself , a giant disk of foaming eddies and furiously revolving water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end like twigs and , in the Whirlpool below , have been known to boil about for weeks at a time before escaping downriver. // On June 10 , 1883 the captain came to Niagara Falls to examine the rapids . Attired in a pearl-colored derby and gray frock coat , he drove along the river on the Canadian side and surveyed the rapids from the heights above . Then he walked down to the water 's edge for a closer view . A few minutes ' study seemed to satisfy him . " A rum bit of water , " was his only comment . Kyle meanwhile was trying to persuade the proprietors of the various falls hotels to post $1,000 as a guarantee and the railroads to run extra trains . He asked for 40% of the excursion proceeds , but neither hotels nor roads were interested , and the two men returned to Nantasket. // A few weeks later they were back in Niagara Falls determined to stage the event anyway . The reason ? The captain , said Kyle , would draw such great crowds at Nantasket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . Few believed him . Kyle distributed 200 circulars to newspapers throughout the United States and Canada , announcing that the feat would take place on the afternoon of July 24 and that Captain Webb would be in the Clifton House at 1 o'clock that day to meet members of the press . During the interview , at which only about half a dozen reporters were present , the captain played with a red clover blossom as he outlined his plan . // He would , he said , dive into the river and let the current take him down toward the rapids . He would try to stay in the middle , away from the rocks along the river 's edge . " When the water gets very bad I will go under the surface and remain beneath until I am compelled to come up for breath . That will be pretty often , I 'll wager . When I reach the Whirlpool I will strike out with all my strength to keep away from the suction hole in the center . It may take me two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a quarter of a mile long . When I get through I will try to land on the Canadian side , but if the current is too swift I will keep on down to Lewiston five miles below on the American side . " // As the hour approached , some 500 spectators had gathered on the suspension bridge down-river , upon the cliffs on either side and along the river 's edge . There was but one comment from the crowd : " If he goes in he 'll never come out alive . " No one knew this better than John McCloy , a veteran ferryman who had rowed back and forth across the calmer parts of the river for years . A few minutes before 4 Captain Webb walked alone from the Clifton House to the foot of the cliff where McCloy was waiting in his little skiff . He quickly undressed , tied a red cotton breechclout around his loins ( the same one he wore when he swam the Channel ) and stepped into the skiff . As McCloy rowed slowly downstream he asked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had left from the Channel swim . " Most of it is gone , " Webb answered . " Well , " said McCloy , " if I was you I 'd go ashore and keep the rest . " There was no reply and the two men went on in silence , as far down as the ferryman dared take the skiff. // THE CAPTAIN 'S LAST PLUNGE // Far below on the suspension bridge , where the first wild water began , the crowd saw the captain stand up in the boat and plunge into the middle of the river . He came to the surface and with slow sweeping strokes went straight ahead toward the bridge . For several minutes he swam through smooth green water , gathering speed as he went , then hurtled like a startled salmon under the bridge and , a moment later , came to the first huge wave of the rapids . Instantly he vanished , but in another second he was thrust to the surface . For a hundred yards or more the crowd caught glimpses of him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engulfed and for more than 200 yards no one saw him , until suddenly he shot upward and spun crazily about , nearly erect above the water . Dead or alive , none could say . Then a rushing mountain of water closed over him , and he was seen no more . Less than four minutes had elapsed from the time he hit the first wave until his final disappearance . // Kyle left for Nantasket to comfort the captain 's wife . Four days later searchers found the body down near Lewiston . It was face downward in the water , the arms and legs extended as though in the act of taking a breast-stroke . A fisherman towed the body into a boathouse where it was guarded by a half-drunken sailor until officials could be summoned . Later an examination by three doctors revealed that there were no bones broken and no injuries sufficient to cause death ; nor had Captain Webb been drowned . Their verdict was that life had been pressed out of him by the force of the water and that " no living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapids alive . " // Today in a Lewiston cemetery " by brooks too broad for leaping " lies the grave of the Shropshire lad . " And the name died before the man . " So run the lines of the poet A. E. Housman , another Shropshire lad .
