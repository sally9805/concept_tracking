When Producer Darryl Zanuck mala-prophesied that the national institution of the ' 30s known as Shirley Temple " would be good every year of her life as long as she lived , " few believed him . Hollywood realists knew that most peewee paragons grew up to be monsters or misfits , kept little of their young luster . But the opening chapter of NBC 's Shirley Temple 's Storybook last week sent viewers on a wildly nostalgic binge and helped make good the ancient Zanuck prophecy . Shirley Temple , now a full-bodiced 29 , had bridged a whole generation without losing so much as a dimple . The goldilocks had turned to deep brown , and the manner was demure as dimity ; but the eyes were still dewy , the acting full of artful childishness , and when she sang the show 's theme song , Dreams Are Made for Children , the voice had the same lilting lisp that warmed the hearts of millions with Polly Wolly Doodle and On the Good Ship Lollipop . <P> Hands on the Wheel . Only the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , " as her old scriptwriters had her do , Shirley merely introduced and narrated Madame le Prince de Beaumont 's enduring moral fable , Beauty and the Beast-the beginning of a close-to-surefire series of fairy tales prepared for Temple and TV by Lawyer-turned-Producer Henry ( Peter Pan ) Jaffe . <P> Backed by a comfortable mixture of sponsors ( Sealtest , Hills Bros , and Breck ) , Jaffe mounted his show with opulent care , and it was played out with style , charm and directness by the Old Vic 's delicate Bloom , Claire , and Charlton Heston . Adapter Joseph Schrank 's dialogue , clean , spare , and always faithful to the original , gave Beauty the illusion that " all life was still at sunrise , a wonder and a wild desire , " made possible such a strikingly gentle image as when Beauty returned to her dying Beast . She touched his hirsute head for the first time , and Beast said , with disarming simplicity : " You are stroking my horrible head . " <P> Beauty : Yes , dear Beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . <P> Although Shirley Temple-still " Presh " to her mother-had very little to do during all this , she had clearly not forgotten the order that used to echo across Fox 's back lot : " The little girl 's hands must be on the wheel all the way . " During rehearsals she was consulted , says Jaffe , " on many things that do n't really involve her . " Of the 16 shows in the $3,200,000 series , she wants to star in three-Rapunzel , Hiawatha , and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow-and narrate the others ( Rip Van Winkle , Sleeping Beauty , Ali Baba , etc. , ) . But to Shirley , the best feature of her Storybook is that most of it is filmed , freeing her for civic and housewifely chores around Atherton , Calif. ( 25 miles south of San Francisco ) , where she leads the life of a wealthy California mother .
