With the breakup of the Berlin Conference and renewed proof of Russia 's implacable hold on East Germany , the focus of uncertainty in Europe shifted back to Paris-and to the familiar , nagging question : What will the French do about EDC , the European army project ? Before leaving Berlin , Foreign Minister Georges Bidault told Secretary Dulles that he hoped to see the legislative gears turning by mid-March and that he hoped for ratification of EDC by mid-April . Not many in France were so optimistic . <P> Before Berlin , Bidault was asked what he would do if the Russians presented him with a clear bargain : peace in Indo-China if France would abandon EDC . Bidault replied sarcastically that he did n't expect to see cards like that placed on the table . " The Russians , " he said , " never play anything but clubs . " Now , however , that there was something else to wait for - the Geneva conference in April-anti-EDC voices were again heard in Paris . Their new refrain : France must not provoke the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ending the Indo-China war at Geneva . <P> The Fears &; Hesitations . In France , the opponents of EDC and the **25;9498;TOOLONG are motivated by a weird variety of fears and hesitations . Some despise and distrust Germany , and that overrides everything else ; some ( including Premier Joseph Laniel , who has made a career these past seven months of political survival ) think of EDC as a dose of unpleasant medicine , to be stalled off as long as possible ; some think that French sovereignty and pride outweigh considerations of security ; some want to toy with the alternatives , or get more concessions-notably , German concessions on the Saar and U.S.-British guarantees to maintain troops in Continental Europe . Inside Laniel 's Cabinet are Gaullists who are solidly against EDC . Most of EDC 's support is in the center and moderate left . Yet a fortnight ago Jules ( " The Lizard " ) Moch , a staunchly anti-Communist Socialist , gave the National Assembly 's Foreign Affairs Committee a thick , hostile report on EDC that amounted , as one commentator said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Decibel Test . Listening to the loudest comment , observers might conclude that EDC has n't a prayer . But the decibel level is not a fair test . Those who are for EDC are for it in a quiet resigned way : in a land so recently occupied , people do not cheer for German rearmament , but only acknowledge its necessity . A hunt for alternatives is on among those EDC opponents who accept a controlled German rearmament if only it could be achieved without any controls on France . Some might vote for EDC if the supranational clauses would not immediately be put into effect . Others spin variations on a plan of General Maxime Weygand 's for an international but not supranational Defense Council of Europe , under NATO , to include not only the Germans , but the British and Scandinavians too . The difficulty in these plans is that most would require a renegotiation with the other five nations of EDC , and some would require such new demands on Germany that , though the French might accept , the Germans would not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives and insistently asks France not to prolong its agony .
