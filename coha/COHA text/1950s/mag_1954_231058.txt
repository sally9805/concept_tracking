When 400 members of the Photo-Engravers ' Union refused to submit their dispute with Manhattan newspaper publishers to arbitration four months ago , the engravers went on strike and 20,000 other newspaper employees refused to cross their picket lines . The eleven-day strike shut down Manhattan 's dailies , cost the papers a total of more than $10 million in revenue and the employees more than $2,000.000 in wages . The engravers , among the highest-paid newspaper employees , finally agreed to go back to work and submit their differences ( a $7.50 weekly wage increase v. $3.75 offered by the publishers ) to a three-man fact-finding committee . Last week the fact finders announced their verdict ( with the union member dissenting ) : a $3.75 weekly package increase , i.e. , just what the publishers originally offered before the strike took place . This week the engravers accepted the " distasteful bitter pill " by a vote of 209 to 76.
