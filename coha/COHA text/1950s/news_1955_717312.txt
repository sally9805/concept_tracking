txt In a nine-page report corn . plate with fifty-five footnotes . a chemist issued a challenge yesterday to scientists who port that man can communicate in some mysterious brainto-brain way . Either subunit one really controlled experiment , he told them in effect . or stop cluttering up scientific journals with your claims . The chemist , Dr. George Price , is a research associate ; in the Department of Medicine it . the University of Minnesotad His challenge was the leading article in the Aug. 26 issue tit Science , journal of the Ameif ? can Association for the Al . vancement of Science . Dr. Price said he believed life scientific colleagues had been too charitable in pondering other scientists ' reports tempting to prove that man could read thoughts or words ' at a distance , could foretell events and could control by thought physical events such as the fall of dice : Mathematicians have examined past claims and reported that they do represent the occurrence of something more than chance , Dr. Price said . As a result , he said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thei parapsychologists ( " pars , " a Greek prefix , means " beside " or " beyond " ) has been published . Dr. Price said he believed the purported evidence for extrasensory perception ( called E. S. P. ) could have been faked . Scientists have been/ too kind to have believed that another scientist could be guilty of scientific fraud , ' deliberate or accidental , Dr. Price said . In particular , he criticized the experiments of S. G. Soal , a mathematician at Queen Mary College of the University of London , and Dr. Joseph B. Rhine , director of the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University , Durham , N. C. They are two leading experimental students of E. S. P. Both the British mathematician and Dr. Rhine have made most of their'tests with subjects they believe to be especially responsive to E. S. P. The tests for the most part have involved the E. S. P.-capable subjects ' ability to say , with ; out looking , how the cards in h shuffled deck will come up . Special decks with symbols ( animal figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guessing Called ' Evidence ' A mere guesser would be expected to attain a given number of correct answers . In some runs , E. S. P.-prone subjects have guessed so many cards correctly that the mathematical odds against it happening by chance are formidable . This is interpreted as " evidence for E. S. P. " Dr. Price said the tests need not be accepted as conclusive evidence . In every instance , he said , it is possible that some method to tell the E. S. P.-prone subject what to answer was used . Dr. Rhine , a plant physiologist who has studied E. S. P. for twenty years , - , indignantly declared in Durham that he wondered how the editor of the leading periodical of American science would open his pages for a " slanderous diatribe . " " LT this is the way that scientific workers are to have their good faith impugned ? even though they are workers in a still unpopular field ? then it would appear that McCarthyism has come to American science , " Dr. Rhine said . " If Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liars I could have helped him find the answer rather easily , " Dr. Rhine said . He cited other examinations of the evidence for E. S. P. ? by reputable scientists  --  and said that they had established long ago that there was something to E. S. P. " It will likely appear a silly question to most scientific men even to ask whether a hundred or more research scientists , most of them professional university people , are so stupid as to indulge in a gigantic hoax involving the hiring of confederates and such , " Dr. Rhine commented . In Science , Dr. Price devoted most of his examination of the evidence for E. S. P. to the studies of Mr. Soal . Dr. Price wrote that he thought a clever chief investigator could gather around him a group bent on proving the existence of E. S. P. Then he could get the so-called E. S. P.-prone subjects to cooperate by appealing " not to desire for fame or material gain but to the noblest motives , arguing that much good Dr. Joseph B. Rhine , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemist . to humanity could result from a small deception designed to strengthen religious beliefs . " Proponents of E. S. P. have professed to have established the existence of " psychokinesis , " in which man can control dice , for instance . Also , man can transmit thought , sometimes great distances , and he can know that something is going to happen be ' fore it does . Tests to establish these elements of E. S. P. have been run . Dr. Price said that ( statistical or clerical errors , mild mental abberations or fraud might explain all the results . Price Lists Reasons He reviewed the principle reasons why physical scientists could not accept the idea that there was an extra sense : CIE.S.P. penetrates the future ( in the tests ) . even in events where the future is not related to the present . IE.S.P. is not attenuated by distance . tiPsychokinetic effects are not altered by shielding such as that which interferes with all known physical waves . q Dye patterns are read in the dark on cards . gPatterns on cards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cards . ( IN ? one has ever found in the body a structure that could be associated with E.S.P . 41E . S. P.-phone subjects have a tendency to lose their extrasensory ability . ciDifferent investigators obtain different results . For instance , Mr. Soal requires a telepathic sender , but Dr. Rhine finds this unnecessary . Dr. Price proposed tests that he said were absolutely " watertight , " tests that could be examined by a committee of scientists in an effort to find any proof of the existence of E. S. P. He said one could send machinesorted decks of cards to Duke University in sealed metal containers . The cards would be opened along with the E. S. P.-prone subjects ' " answers " under a motion-picture camera with the jury watching . Similar controlled tests were proposed of the more elaborate studies suggesting that E. S. P. does exist . In the past , parapsychologists have generally declined to take such tests . They have said that the presence of motion-picture cameras or witnesses would throw off their E. S. P.-prone subjects . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything had to be done in the presence of witnesses and with numerous precautions . They have maintained that E. S. P. has been proved and it is not their function to convince all the critics , one by one .
