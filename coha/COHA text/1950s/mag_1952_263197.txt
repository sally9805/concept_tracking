This week TIME 'S John Scott starts on tour as one of our speakers at U.S. colleges and journalism schools . His subjects : the defense of Europe , the emergence of European unity , and the impact of the U.S. on European affairs . <P> Scott , who has spent almost half his life working close to ( and on both sides of ) the Iron Curtain , took a refresher look overseas this summer , when he spent nine weeks talking on Soviet and U.S. foreign policy to U.S. troops in Europe and North Africa . On the trip , he gave 46 talks to a total audience of almost 12,000 officers , enlisted men and , in a few instances , civilians . He was invited to make the tour by the Defense Department , after he had spoken before several military groups in the U.S. last year . TIME agreed to pay his expenses , but Scott was at the disposal of the Defense Department . <P> Two of Scott 's talks during the summer were delivered in German . Once , he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor-of the town of Regensburg . When he discovered that many members of his audience had n't understood a word , he repeated the talk in German . Another talk was given in Russian , to a group of Russian refugees for whom a radio station is being set up in Munich to beam its broadcasts to the peoples of Russia . At the time Scott spoke , the project was stalemated because of differences among the refugees themselves . One hassle was over names . The rightist refugees were against using the word " Soviet , " because they felt the Soviet government had no legal existence ; the national minorities , such as the Tur-kestani , were opposed to using the word " Russia . " Scott urged them to compose their differences and to concentrate on the more important objective of liberating people from Soviet tyranny . The station has now been christened " Radio Liberation , " and will go on the air in a few weeks . <P> In his talks to military personnel , and especially in the question periods which followed , Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their questions : What is the significance of the troubles of Madame Ana Pauker ? How do you evaluate the work of the Voice of America ? Can we hope for a split in Russia between the military and political leaders ? Why does the U.S. continue to spend money abroad ? Are people behind the Iron Curtain mature enough to select their own governments if liberated ? Is the Schuman Plan an effective means to counteract Soviet aggression in Europe ? Why do we not let the Russians have Berlin ? <P> To answer these and other questions , Scott had to call on his own experiences during a decade he spent in Russia . Asked , for instance , what effect the arming of Western Germany would have on Soviet foreign policy , he said : " I do n't think it has any . The Soviet government takes it for granted that their enemies are doing everything possible against them anyway . They take it for granted that we 've been building a West German army against them since 1945 . When the West German troops are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Soviet foreign policy . Short of an attack on the Soviet Union , I do n't think we could provoke a war . They 'll attack us when they think they can win , not sooner or later . "
