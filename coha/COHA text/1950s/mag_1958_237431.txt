In the 2nd century A.D. , the Emperor Trajan startled Rome 's housewives by introducing the revolutionary idea of the covered market . It seemed the last word in shopping , and for the next 18 centuries it was the last word-in Italy . Every weekday morning for those 1,800-odd years , the Italian housewife ( or her maid ) set out on the same ritualistic , time-consuming round . <P> For chicken and eggs she went to one shop , for olive oil or wine to another . She could not buy pork where she bought veal . If she wanted sausages , she could not expect to find eggs at a nearby counter . After both industries became state monopolies , she had to go to the neighborhood tobacconist to buy salt . Each day she had to visit up to a dozen different shops to buy just enough food to last until the next day . Each day shopping for food alone took anything up to four hours . <P> Most shoppers and most shopkeepers still hew to this ancient system , but a rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberated . The liberator : the American-style supermarket . <P> Rockefeller Revolution . Italians said the supermarket could never succeed , and for long years the arguments sounded convincing : the housewife would never surrender the personal pleasure of bargaining down prices with the neighborhood shopkeeper , maids would not forego their leisurely gossip sessions in the marketplace , clerks and customers would steal the counters bare ( as they did in a small-scale experiment with a self-service store in Milan in 1949 ) . But after Romans stampeded the big U.S. supermarket set up under the direction of Grand Union 's President Lansing P. Shield at an international food congress in Rome in 1956 , enterprising Italians and American businessmen decided the time had come to improve on Trajan . <P> Today Milan and Rome between them boast eight supermarkets . Biggest operators : the Italian-owned Supermercato S.p.A. , and the fast-growing Supermarkets Italiani ( majority owner : Nelson Rockefeller 's International Basic Economy Co . ) . Up to 10,000 customers a day in the two cities revel in the choice of up to 1,800 separate items ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pineapples to frozen pizzas and spaghetti in plastic bags . Increasingly , middle-class housewives leave their maids at home ( thus ending the maids ' expected rake-off on the week 's shopping money ) , personally wheel their market carts in air-conditioned luxury past shelves labeled in English " roast chicken " ( which presumably sounds more exotic than polio arrosto ) . Tommy-gun-toting guards accompany the cashiers to the company 's central office with the day 's take ; the supermarkets ' loss from theft is less than 1% . <P> Better than Brynner . For the ordinary Italian family the supermarket still has drawbacks . Unlike the small shops , the supermarkets do not give credit or make home deliveries . Most Italian housewives can not afford imported foods , can not take home much food on a motor scooter , and do not have a refrigerator to store the food at home . Nonetheless , shopkeepers located near supermarkets complain that their business is down a third . Even Communist housewives have ignored the Red complaint that " Rockefeller is strangling the food merchants . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
