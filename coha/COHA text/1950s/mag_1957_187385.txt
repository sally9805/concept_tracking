Paris taxi drivers had only one question for their U.S. passengers : " How is General Ike ? " The people of Western Europe had awaited Ike 's arrival half in dread , fearful that illness had drained his vitality and transformed the buoyant commander of World War II into a tired old man . But as the President of the U.S. plunged eagerly into a hectic round of private talks and public appearances , fear gave way to reassurance . " Ike 's smile , " reported Paris ' Journal du Dimanche , " has again played its magic role . " <P> Only on the first day of the meeting did Ike show any inclination to husband his energy . When the second of the day 's two conference sessions ran past 8 o'clock , he begged off attending a black-tie dinner given by NATO Secretary-General Paul-Henri Spaak . Rumors that the President was ill promptly swept through the press corps . Grinned Ike : " Tell those gentlemen I am a 9:30 or 10 o'clock boy tonight . " <P> Special Sickness . Next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears were groundless , Ike took on a jampacked schedule . In the morning he drove out to suburban Rocquencourt to visit SHAPE-the NATO military headquarters which he established in 1951 . Ignoring the freezing wind , Ike stood at salute through the Marseillaise and The Star-Spangled Banner , then set off on a tour of the headquarters with U.S. General Lauris Norstad. the man who now holds his old job as SACEUR ( Supreme Allied Commander Europe ) . After a quick look at the office that he left in 1952 to campaign for the presidency , Ike dropped into the officers ' mess , sipped at a martini proffered by Norstad with the rueful comment : " It 's been many a year since I had one . " <P> As the time approached for his return to Paris , Ike 's nostalgia bubbled over in an off-the-cuff speech to a small crowd of SHAPE personnel and their families . Said he : " I came out here because of a special kind of sickness , one that afflicts the aged and the young-homesickness . I must acknowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange if I felt quite as natural with my civilian hat as I did with my military cap . And I want to indulge for just a moment this feeling of homesickness , the fun of going and seeing some of the people of SHAPE who are carrying the same mission , doing the same job that all of us started in 1951 ... To all of you , greetings , good wishes , good luck , and I hope that your homes are warm and nice , and the kids in good health and everything is going fine with all of you-from whatever nation you are . " <P> Pleas in Private . But for most of his stay in Paris , the President was immersed in the problems of the present . He had already conferred privately with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan . France 's Felix Gaillard had called to tell the President that practically every Frenchman is convinced that the U.S. has covert designs on North Africa , particularly on the Sahara 's oil . Shocked , Ike told Gaillard emphatically that the U.S. had no intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfering in the war in Algeria .
