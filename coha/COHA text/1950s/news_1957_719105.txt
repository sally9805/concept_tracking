txt ECONOMISTS DOUBT BUSINESS UPTURN WITHOUT TAX CUT Congress Expected to Trim Levies in 1958 ? Experts ? Dispute Talk of Slump By RICHARD E. MOONEY S .. ecial to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , Sept , 2 ? High-level Government economists see no trends at this moment that are likely to produce a new surge in the nation 's economy . The next big spurt , according to some , will come from a tax cut . Their views do not include any prediction whether or when there will be a tax cut , but most observers are expecting Congress to enact one next year . While these economists do not foresee a new surge of business activity as things stand now , they also dispute talk of a slump from other quarters . Economy Remains Stable Taking all the plus elements and minus elements into account , the over-all economy has been fairly stable at a record level since last winter . The dollar figures on economic activity have risen , but mostly because of rising prices rather than greater physical output . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appreciable increase in consumer buying , greater business investment in plant expansion , larger Federal outlays or a swelling of that nebulous element called confidence . ' Dose were factors in bringing about and sustaining the two-year-old boom , but they are past . Though a new burst of activity could develop if credit were made easier , such an easing is not expected until there are more certain signs that the price rise has been halted . Defense Cuts Bring Concern Business circles have shown particular concern lately over the new cutbacks in the defense program . From the point of view of economists , the cutbacks are necessary to reduce the inflationary pressures of Government , particularly defense spending . Another reason for some of the slow-down in defense payments is to help keep the national debt from breaking through its $275,000,000,000 ceiling . And , finally , the defense and other Federal spending reductions are necessary to keep total outlays from rising in year to come ; that is , to keep the total from growing as fast as revenues and eating up prospective surpluses . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbalancing the budget , there would have to be more surplus // revenues than the current pattern of $1,500,000,000 to $2,000 , - 000,000 a year . Depending on such factors as the absence of a slump and a world crisis and control of Federal spending , it is possible that the surplus will be as large as $3,000,000,000 to $5,000,000,000 in the next fiscal year , which is Still ten months away . Byrd Sees a Surplus Senator Harry F. Byrd , Virginia Democrat and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , said today that the surplus might ' run to $6,000,000,000 , spending were cut enough . He said that he would favor using $2,000,000,000 to reduce the debt and the rest to reduce taxes . The idea of a tax cut has obvious political appeal , particularly in the 1958 Congressional election year . The Administration opposed the strong pressure for a cut this year , on the ground that it would be inflationary , and the leaders of Congress postponed action . There will be no initial agreement , of course , on where to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corpornion income taxes and certain excise taxes will be several years overdue . The Administration has promised some cuts to small business , and has started talking with state governments about yielding them some tax ground . No large tax cut would be passed without some relief for individual taxpayers . And there are always some taxes considered unfair that have to be straightened out . ? There may still be opposition to a cut on anti-inflation grounds , but probably not from the Administration . William McC . Martin Jr. , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , said in a ' Statement made public this weekend that " in an economy as large as ours and with the proportion of Government-stimulated activity as high as it is in our economy , the Federal Government should plan on larger budget surpluses in periods of high activity . " He said that under conditions of strong non-Government demand for loans , such as now , " a substantial Federal Government surplus and retirement of Government debt help to provide additional funds " to finance private and state and local government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers to questions posed by Senator Byrd at a recent hearing .
