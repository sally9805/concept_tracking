Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision in Illinois ' famed McCollum case ( TIME , Sept. 24 , 1945 ) , states and cities with " released-time " programs have been faced with a worrisome question : Can religious instruction for public-school children ever be legal ? Last week the New York state court of appeals gave an answer : yes . <P> The decision grew out of a suit brought by two Brooklyn parents who charged that New York City 's released-time program ( in operation since 1941 ) was a clear violation of the principle of separation of church &; state . In a 6-to-1 decision , New York 's highest court declared that it was not . The program in New York , said the court , was nothing like that of Champaign , Ill. , which the Supreme Court had declared unconstitutional in the McCollum case . In Champaign , religious instruction took place on school property , thus got some support from public funds . In New York City , this is not so ; the children are merely dismissed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents want them to have religious teaching elsewhere . <P> " It is manifest , " said the court , " that the McCollum case is not a holding that all released-time programs are per se unconstitutional . . . The Constitution does not demand that every friendly gesture between church and state shall be discountenanced . The so-called ' wall of separation ' may be built so high and so broad as to impair both state and church ... It must also be remembered that the First Amendment not only forbids laws ' respecting an establishment of religion , ' but also laws ' prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ' We must not destroy one in an effort to preserve the other . "
