Arthur Roberts of the University of Rochester is a man with two abiding interests : nuclear physics and music . While studying for his M.A. at Columbia in the ' 30s , he also found time to get a diploma at Manhattan School of Music . Even while working in the radiation laboratory at M.I.T. during the war , he managed to write a piano sonata , a quartet , two worthy operettas and some good-humored songs , including one called The Cyclotronist 's Nightmare . <P> Last week Physicist Roberts ' newest composition , An Overture for the Dedication of a Nuclear Reactor , got a fitting first performance-by the 69-piece Oak Ridge ( Tenn . ) Symphony Orchestra ( 30 atomic scientists , 16 wives , some sons &; daughters ) . <P> In the Oak Ridge High School Auditorium , lanky ( 6 ft. 4 in . ) Dr. Roberts , 39 , heard Conductor Waldo Cohn , a biochemist , explain the new piece to one of the few audiences in the world who could understand the composer 's complex program notes . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dr. Roberts , features four motives : the tones of AEC , and then the harmonic intervals 6-C-12 ( formula : sixth element on the periodic table , carbon , atomic weight 12 ) ; then 92-235 ( 92nd element , uranium ) , and 94-239 ( 94th element , plutonium ) . In the third section , " quite a lot happens when the pile goes critical : the 92-239 theme goes through some well-known transmutations . This is accompanied by the increasingly rapid operation of a BF-3 theme ( boron tri-fluoride ) in the woodwinds , and is terminated by a ' scram ' for which I found it expedient to use cadmium ( C-D ) . " <P> When Dr. Cohn finally launched the orchestra into the eleven-minute piece , it was not as awesome and confusing as Composer Roberts ' description . Most found it pleasantly melodious and rhythmically interesting , particularly in the long , Bolero-like section called " Initial Operation . " Dr. Alvin M. Weinberg , director of research at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , thought it " captured the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listening to it , you could see the pile growing . " <P> Oak Ridge 's local music critic found some of it " rather repetitious . But then , so is a chain reaction . "
