One conductor slammed down his baton , grumbled " auf Wiedersehen , " and walked out . Leading singers caught colds in the wet July weather . Technicians scrambled to lighten the murky stage so that the audience could see more of what was going on . After six weeks of preparing the season , Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner last week raised the curtain on the opening production , their grandfather 's Tannhuser . Despite all crises , the production turned out topnotch . <P> Bayreuth had not dared do Tannhuser since Toscanini 's unforgettable version 24 years ago . But brothers Wieland and Wolfgang , who will dare anything , decided the old Venusberg needed some drastic new landscaping . They hired fast-rising , Kiev-born Conductor Igor Markevitch , who had never done Wagnerian opera before , then replaced him with Germany 's Joseph Keilberth . " I was not aware that anybody here was interested in tempo , " huffed Markevitch at one point . " All they talk about is lighting " - and no wonder , for Director Wieland Wagner 's new staging relies mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one afternoon last week , nobody at Bayreuth quite knew what to expect . <P> Musically , the production proved to be more than adequate , despite the fact that Tenor Ramon Vinay and pretty Soprano Gre Brouenstein showed signs of strain . The chorus , one of the world 's finest , performed brilliantly . But the chief attraction , as usual , was the staging . Wieland sees Tannhuser as a harried misfit in a world of rigid conventions . Dressed in a black cloak ( while the other minstrels wear brown ) , he moves among stiff , almost mechanized people of the court . Preparing for the crucial song contest in the second act-usually staged with casual confusion-uniformly dressed men and women march into the hall in stiff military style . But the orgiastic Venusberg scene , set in flowing concentric circles of light , is heavily sensual : the ballet flings itself into bumps and grinds that rival the old Minsky 's . <P> After the final curtain , half of the Bayreuth audience seemed in tears , clapped for 15 minutes . With Tannhuser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works in their new , bare , dramatically lighted dress . Their style has become a prototype for new Wagner productions in most major opera houses . Notable exception : New York 's Metropolitan , whose Wagner producers seem never to have heard of Bayreuth 's lighting , let alone Minsky's.
