U.S. radio , with all its cultural failures , can boast of one proud accomplishment : it has greatly widened the audience for good music . Television may be doing the same thing for opera . The tried &; true arias have long been popular favorites on such TV variety programs as Your Show of Shows and Toast of the Town . The NBC network pioneered in producing such TV-sized operas as Menotti 's Amahl and the Night Visitors and Martinu 's The Marriage . In Manhattan , independent station WPIX has been telecasting Opera Cameos for the past three years , complete with a sponsor ( Progresso Brand Quality Foods ) and a ready-made audience of opera lovers . <P> Louisville 's station WAVE-TV is now proving that there is also a large grassroots audience ready and waiting for TV opera . In cooperation with the University of Louisville School of Music , WAVE-TV is telecasting 30-minute condensations of such favorites as La Bohme , Traviata and Hansel and Gretel . All of the operas are sung in English ; the casts are made up of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies free scenery , costumes and technicians , while Director Moritz Bomhard and his staff come from the university . Says Bomhard : " The cost is so low I do n't like to mention it . " <P> By discarding all subplots , Bomhard is able to tell the story of each opera in 30 minutes . He pays as much attention to the acting and sets as to the singing ( " Opera must not only be good music , but also good theater " ) . Station WAVE-TV gets an encouraging mail response from its TV audience . Better still , no one has complained that he would rather have hillbilly music or western movies . Bomhard hopes to be back this fall with his second series . He " also hopes that other stations throughout the nation will take the plunge into opera , because " it 's unhealthy to have everything centralized in New York . "
