Like Democratic nominees in Mississippi , Kuomintang nominees on Formosa are sure to be elected . Last week , on restless , frustrated Formosa , 32 members of the Kuomintang 's Central Committee were gathered to choose nominees for the presidency and vice presidency of Nationalist China for the next six years . The men they chose would be certain winners in next month 's elections . <P> After a seemly show of reluctance , aging ( 66 ) , indomitable Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek consented to succeed himself as President . All interest then focused on Chiang 's choice for Vice President : he would be , in effect , Chiang 's choice as his successor , and the man who would automatically succeed him if Chiang should die in office . Chiang 's own choice : Premier Chen Cheng . <P> The committeemen gladly concurred . After the Nationalist defeat by the Communists , Chen was Formosa 's first governor ( January-December , 1949 ) . Encountering near chaos when he took over , Chen restored order , tightened discipline , eliminated " paper soldiers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central and southern Formosa for regrouping and retraining-and saw that they were paid . His land-reform measures caused Formosa 's small farmers to call him , affectionately , Chen Cheng Po ( Elder Uncle Chen Cheng ) . Since he stands 5 ft. 5 in. and weighs only no Ibs. , he is also known , without disrespect , as the " Little Premier . " <P> A teacher 's son , Chen was born 56 years ago in Chekiang province . He attended the Paoting Military Academy , met Chiang Kai-shek in the early ' 203 and has been a trusted lieutenant and devoted friend ever since . During the wars against Japan and the Communists , he held important military commands ( including chief of staff to Chiang in 1946-48 ) ; not even his foes ever accused him of the slightest personal corruption . He is polite , considerate and sincere , but his geniality is not softness . Once he had an army driver executed at the very spot in downtown Taipei where a pedestrian had been killed through the soldier 's reckless driving . Chen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must enforce discipline , " he replied . <P> In 1931 Chen married Tan Hsiang , comely daughter of Nationalist China 's first Premier , and they now have six children , all attending school at Taipei . Tan , a Christian , has tried to convert her husband to Christianity , but he remains loyal to Confucius . <P> Last Christmas Day , Uncle Chen said to a meeting of Assemblymen : " My creed is the common good instead of personal self-interest , fellowship and cooperation instead of ill-will and intrigue , mutual trust instead of mutual suspicion , and encouragement for one another instead of blame .
