Most of you will undoubtedly be following with interest the national political conventions during July-hearing and seeing them on radio and television and reading about them in TIME and in your newspapers . <P> Because the great body of material at hand about conventions , properly organized , could help in understanding the Chicago meetings . TIME decided to publish a convention booklet and to make it available to the public . <P> Political conventions are always exciting , and this year 's are certainly no exception . With the President no longer a contender , this is the first time since 1928 that the nation will be witnessing two " open " conventions . Neither one will be the kind of rubber-stamp gathering at which the delegates merely meet to approve Administration policies and nominate the man already in office . <P> National party conventions , of course , come only once in four years - not so far apart that we forget their purposes and atmosphere , but far enough apart so that we forget many of their details and procedures . Behind most of these procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the method in the apparent madness of the convention . <P> TIME 'S booklet has a section on the history , highlights and highjinks of past conventions , as well as the customs and regulations that will guide the party gatherings this year . It also has box scores with which you can follow the voting , a presidential map of the U.S. , an explanation of how Presidents are elected , a gallery of key political figures and a special section for your own personal record of the conventions . <P> <P> In pulling together the material on political conventions and elections , the team that worked on the booklet found a mass of out-of-the-way information about our political parties and their operation , past &; present . As you may know , the Constitution says nothing about parties and conventions and there has been no great body of federal law to regulate them . As a result , the parties grew like Topsy , developing their own rules as they went along . <P> Although states now regulate political parties closely , the national conventions are still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No convention is bound by the rules of the last one , and surprises can be expected at any time . <P> TIME has tried to compress into the booklet as many such facts as are needed to make the conventions meaningful to the average voter and citizen . In addition to being a convention guide , the booklet is also designed as a personal record book , which you may wish to keep as a souvenir of one of the most important events of this decade . <P> Normal distribution of the booklet will be through the radio and television facilities of the Columbia Broadcasting System and its local affiliates . But if you would like a copy for yourself , and perhaps another for a friend , you can have one by sending a card with your name &; address and the name &; address of one friend ( the supply is limited ) to TIME Convention , Box 1096 , Chicago 90 , Illinois . <P> After you have read it , or used it during the conventions , I would be interested in hearing whether you found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to send .
