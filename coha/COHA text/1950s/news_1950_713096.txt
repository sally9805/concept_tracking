txt Financial kingpins like Secretary John Snyder of the Treasury and Chairman Thomas McCabe of the Federal Reserve Board think the Korean fighting is likely to cause a lot of unwanted inflation - and someone should stop it . But at the moment they are playing the old bureaucratic game called " Pass the Buck . " The office of each thinks someone else should do most of the job of curbing the inflation . ( Inflationary pressure would be increased by heavier spending  --  and President Truman will ask Congress next week for the first huge extra chunk of money for the Korean wnr . Estimates are he will seek between S3 billion and S5 billion . Story on Page 2 . Wholesale prices arc bulging upward . The Government 's index jumped 1 . S in the week ended July 11 . Story on Page 2 1 The Federal Reserve Board Is ? needling the Treasury to let government interest rates go up ? thus making it more costly for business to borrow . It also wants the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smaller guarantees on mortgages and other home financing . Curb on Consumer Credit The Treasury thinks the Federal Reserve should restrict instalment buying and other forms of consumer credit . F H A. believes the only effective way to prick the building boom is for Congress to empower some unnamed , perhaps new office . to divert construction materials to war and restrict civilian uses . If the Korean war continues , sonic curbs on credit and materials arc certainly going to be imposed , but the decision on just what is to be done has n't been made by President Truman yet . With but one exception , he could direct all the things these agencies propose without asking Congress for new laws . He would need legislation to control civilian use of materials . Officials arc worrying about inflation for a lot of reasons . They think it will make government ouying of steel , non-ferrous metals , chemicals , textiles and building materials more difficult and costly . They expect these supplies will soon be demanded in greater volume by a bigger military program  --  though actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The civilian scramble for the same goods is likely , many government economists fear . Increases Produce Increases In wartime . price increases have a way of producing more price increases . Many people speed up their buying for fear prices will go still higher . Labor unions up their wage demands to keep pace with living costs . If the fighting is confined to Korea and is over in a matter of months , any boost of inflation now might be followed then by painful readjustments ; businessmen could find themselves with over-valued inventories , and consumers , already well-stocked , might be wrestling with heavier debts . There 's also a bevy of reasons for the bureaucrats ' reluctance to take on the job of fighting inflation . They are n't sure yet that clearing communists from South Korea is going to take a long struggle ; some officials still fall back on the hope , which they admit seems forlorn , that " this may all clear up over night . " Question of Size They do n't know just how much bigger military costs are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exaggerating the inflationary prospects . Above all , each agency fears that efforts on its part to stem inflation will prove exceedingly troublesome , especially if there is n't some grand , coordinated government progi am . A member of the President 's Council of Economic Advisors puts it this way . " You find that in solving one problem you just create another . That 's why we believe in going slow and doing nothing until it 's absolutely sure that something has-to be done . " As an illustration , this man suggested , " Suppose you use priorities under the draft law to divert supplies to the armed forces . Then you get businessmen struggling for what 's left . And then somc people clamor for government controls to make sure small companies and hospitals and the like get their fair share . " Also , if controls are put on consumer credit , funds will be released in the banks for more real estate mortgages , thus making for less inflation in some lines but more inflation in others . Point of Agreement Federal economists agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat inflation now . That 's because they feel excessive borrowing even before the Korean shooting enabled consumers to bid up prices . The Federal Reserve Board has the chief duty of regulating bank credit and the nation a supply of money . Its experts favor countering inflation by using this general type of control . They would do it in two ways : First , Federal Reserve banks would hold off buying Government securities . Commercial banks own over $65 billion of Treasury obligations . They sell them when they want cash to make loans to business men and consumers . If the Federal Reserve . which is a kind of " market of last resort , " stops its buying , the banks will have a harder job selling and thus will make fewer loans . A policy of this sort would also tend to raise interest rates and make borrowing more costly . Prices of U S bonds and notes would decline ; buyers would get the same interest rate but pay less for their securities . They would expect the Treasury , whenever it sells any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break as they can get by purchasing issues already on the market . When the Treasury hiked its rate in Ilne with the market ? interest on regular business-type loans would also go up , Higher Cash Reserves As a second step , if necessary . the F It B could require nearly 7.000 commercial banks belonging to the Federal Reserve System to set aside more cash as reserves against their customers ' deposits . This would also lease them with less money for making loans . Such action by the board makes trouble for the Treasury . It would have to pay inure interest on part of the $257 billion public debt and it would also have a harder job selling new securities to the banks . Before the war began , the board thought the Treasury would agree to mild moves alone ' these lines . After the shooting started , it decided to double-check . The response ? " You can say we 're giving the board no encouragement , " a Treasury man declares . He predicts . " You can assume government interest rates are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department might even try to push present rates down , if the war eventually quires sales of billions of new government securities monthly . as it did in World War II . At that time , the Tieasury froze the rates at As% on its 90-day bills ; at 3i. % on its one-year certificates , and at 1 iz% on bonds maturing in 20 years and over . Now , the koing rate is about 1.174% on hills and almost 11i% on certificates . The long-term interest has not been allowed to go above 21 , - ; , % . What does the Treasury think should be done about controlling the loans if broad fiscal moves are ruled out ? " We believe its probably going to be necessary and more effective to apply special controls at trouble spots , - a Treasury expert suggests . Secretary Snyder already has warned the Federal Reserve to be prepared to revive its regulation of consumer credit ? ? Regulation W " ? which Congress allowed to expire on June 30 , 1949 . President 's Power Though the law authorizing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a law dating back to 1917 which gives the President power In a national emergency . On receipt of an order from President Roosevelt under this old law , the board issued its World ii-ar n " Regulation W " which fixed minimum down payments and maximum payoff time for purchases of automobiles , furniture , and most appliances . " I 'm afraid the President will proclaim a national ? mergency and force us to regulate consumer credit . " says a key board official , adding . " and I do n't think that should be done unless restrictions are also put on real estate loans . F.R.B. men have passed this idea on to the counsel of . economic advisors which will frame any anti-inflation program in connection with the Korean scrap . Apparently the board has had little response . or the C.E.A. likes to see lots of houses going up . However ? one council member admits that some thought has been given to the possibility of asking F.H.A. and V.A . to " drag their heels " on making new commitments to insure loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fa-1.A. , an expert admits quite a lot could be done if the President decides to temper the building boom . In 1945 , in order to combat inflation , this agency required home owners to pay 10% cash in order to get government insurance on loans for improvements and repairs . The rule was abolished last year but could be reinvoked . Improvement loans account for about onesixth of F.H.A. 's business . Last year they amounted to $607,300,000 . F.H.A. and V.A . field offices could also get more suspicious in appraising home values . The lower the value , the smaller the mortgage the government will insure . The prevailing policy is to be " as liberal as possible , " providing houses meet certain minimum standards . Though government credit insurance could be made less liberal , housing aides do n't think this would be the best way to scale down construction . They reason that F.H.A. and V.A . business will naturally fall off any time materials are diverted from residential builders to the government and essential civilian merchants . F.H.A. thinks this would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally fall to some other agencies .
