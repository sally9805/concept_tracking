txt  | You Never Did Hear No Blues About Whitey B.B. KING CRUNCHING ONTO the tarmac of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis , I began to feel like Whitey the Intruder . Evidently , the feeling was shared by a few other people . As I crawled out of a local musician 's car , all the black family groups stood there silently , their coat hangers in their hands , giving me those big small-town stares . My friend Don Porter , the songwriter , helped ease matters by pumping the hand of the motel owner ( who asked the newcomer what he was " carryin ' " and then hit him for five ) . Still , the place was a setup for self-consciousness . Up there on the gallery , behind the door embossed with the big purple Easter cross , was the shrine of the latest black martyr . Down here in the yard were his people , alive and angry . The burnt and boarded vestiges of their rage were strewn all across town . Times were bad , said every white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro . In Memphis , everybody was cryin ' the blues . The man I had come to see was Memphis ' most famous  | blues singer , B.B. ( Beale Street Blues Boy ) King . Rarely a visitor to his own home town , King had flown in the night before to do a benefit with his half-brother , Albert , for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference . As the motel owner unlocked the door and steered me into the room , my feeling of intrusiveness rose in a cresendo of embarrassment . Stepping over the ruins of a half-eaten meal and skirting a suitcase that had spilt its contents across the floor , I stared down at the famous blues-man , big , black , blearyeyed , lying naked beneath the sheet . He raised his curiously old-fashioned head off the pillow , smiled vaguely and mumbled some words of welcome . As I began to explain my visit , the door opened again and in sauntered Albert King , his massive chest exposed through a wide-open red shirt , his head covered with a neatly knotted process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proprietorial air , Albert walked over to the TV , which was rolling up its pictures like a baby-doll 's eyes , and after fiddling with the knobs for a moment , gave the set a thunderous rap and then strolled out , a diamond solitaire flashing from his undershirt . B.B. King , meanwhile , had gotten his head together and motioned me to sit down and listen to his words . As it turned out , he likes to talk with journalists and prides himself on his ability to tell his story in correct English , pausing only occasionally to " call it . " As I discovered later , he tells every reporter the same story in substantially the same words . ( Any writer who wants to fake an interview can get a neatly typed transcript of the whole narrative simply by writing to the publicity department of ABC-Paramount . ) Actually , B.B. 's story is a pretty good yarn , picked out with threads that are both sad and gay , woven in and out of the buckram of Mississippi rural life . Deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on a plantation working for the whites , chopping and picking cotton for 75 cents a day . He first heard an electric guitar in a " sanctified " church : " I loved it so , I asked my boss if he would get me a guitar and  | take it out of my wages . I 'll never forget that red guitar with a round hole in it . " Picking up the three blues chords by watching the preacher , he managed to teach himself to play . When World War II reached the South , he was inducted into the army , but the plantation owners controlled the local draft boards in Mississippi : " So after I did my basic training , they brought me back to the farm to drive a tractor . I was n't allowed to leave that plantation until after the war was over . Sometimes I wish they had let me serve , because then I would have been able to study music . " Weekends , he used to sneak off the plantation , take the train to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickels and dimes . When the war ended , he slipped his shackles and journeyed up to Memphis , where he got two jobs : one playing for ladies in the front room of a gambling hall ( while the men went for broke in the back ) ; the other on a radio medicine show , plugging an alcoholic tonic called Pepticon . Memphis marked the turning point in his career . Up until then he knew nothing but Delta Blues . He had watched his cousin , Bukka White , put a steel bar on his finger and get that cruel , hard bottleneck sound . He had slipped into a country tonk to hear Sonny Boy Williamson holler his mean dirty blues . Now at " Headquarters , " he began to taste music from other parts of . Down in the Southwest a fresh generation of bluesmen were working to slick down the blues and make them presentable to modern city audiences . Focusing the old twang and fuzz into clear , smooth tones and modifying the traditional delivery in the direction of lightness and relaxation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballad , creating a new form called the " blues ballad . " The basic impulse behind the " clean blues " was the altered attitude of the Negro in postwar America . In those days the cry of the ghetto was , " Are you ready ? , " a phrase that encapsulated the mixture of ambition and anxiety  | aroused in the Negro by the prospect of going out and competing with Mr. Charley . The new Negro was eager to shuck the last vestiges of his rustic past ; he had no use for country blues or city blues or urban blues . All those old black sounds smelled of slavery . What he wanted was a sophisticated modern style that would be cool and confident and full of throw-away lines . That longing was to be fulfilled , as the Forties turned into the Fifties , by the onetime " Pepticon Boy , " known later by his hipster hieroglyph , " B.B. " Becoming a black star in a black sky , King never had a reputation outside the ghetto until recently ; but the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Regal Theater in unprecedented numbers . Musically undistinguished , stylistically diluted , his songs packed their punches not in blue notes but in verbal imprecations . He developed a formula ? maybe it was an obsession . All his good songs are written in the accusative , all of them voice the indignation of the honest man against the cheating woman . Invariably they come to their climaxes in stinging waves of anger that break with King shouting a line like , " I gave you seven children and now you want to give them back . " Twanging on the raw nerves of sexual rage and guilt , King delivers a series of blue shocks to his audience , shocks of appalled recognition that set them screaming in their seats . His old theatrical performance is available on a record titled B.B. King Live at the Regal . You hear a clenchthroated singer ? like Jim Ameche in blackface ? working in front of a sloppy jump band that plays old-fashioned arrangements with boogie basses and bouncy traveling beats . As this pack of winded jazz hounds runs through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of show tricks : one moment he screams in falsetto ; the next he pauses to preach a sermonette . Playing shrilly on his guitar , he goes into his medley of big hits , coyly introducing each number : " Perhaps some of you may remember ? It 's four o'clock in the  | morning baby ! ? thank you , thank you . " The greatest talent evinced by the record is not for music but for salesmanship . When hip B.B. has to put a song across , he goes right back to being the " Pepticon Boy . " Today , B.B. King is out of the black vaudeville houses and into the white rock big time . Ever since his triumphant appearance at the 1967 Monterey Jazz Festival , he has been stoning the Generation , who regard him as the boss of the real , funky , low-down dirty blues . The experience has revitalized B.B. King as one can see from the hugely successful Alive and Well , especially the great " Why I Sing the Blues . " To answer the key question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universal Nigger , witness and victim of the entire tragedy of black life in America . Ranging like another Juvenal in another Rome from slave ship to ghetto tenement , from slum school to welfare office , he builds relentlessly his indictment of a society that denies food to the poor , education to the ignorant and charity to the blind . This woeful spectacle he surveys not as a preacher or a politician but as a bluesman with an instinct for the life born from suffering , the pride wrung from humiliation . Passing from grim humor to heart-bracing indignation , he rises finally on a bass that rolls like destiny to a furious exultancy in suffering that is almost joy . " I just love to sing my blues , " he shouts ? and you know that B.B. King has found the answer to his question , an answer as honest , as paradoxical and profound as the life and art he celebrates . University Review , 1969  | In His Own Dream PAUL BUTTERFIELD MUST HAVE been in a fantasy , " mused Paul Butterfield , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble table . Looking very different from the Tennessee Williams Silenus he is onstage , Butterfield gazes at you limply with small , wide-spaced eyes set in a soft , pale face shaded by heavy hair combed back straight with just a suggestion of an old-fashioned center part . It 's the classic face of the apple-cheeked Midwestern boy turned sallow and sleepy by late hours and the life of the road . At five in the afternoon , Paul is just getting himself together , complaining about his leaking sinuses and the problems of having no home but a band bus . When the questions begin to bend him back to his early years , he turns his head , as if to get a better view of that far-off time , and repeating dreamily , " I must have been in a fantasy , " he tells his story in the softly falling phrases of the blues . Growing up in Hyde Park , the University of Chicago 's stockade on the edge of the Black Belt , Paul led a quietly schizzy life . By day he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced the flute and sang in the church choir . By night he was an urban Tom Sawyer , slipping over the back fence to explore some of the raunchiest bars in the ghetto . It was not black women or white pills he was seeking but blues , the music that is now the obsession of a whole generation of city and suburban kids . These are the lads who would like to step through an album cover and come out the other side as ancient blacks from the Delta . For reasons best known to themselves ( and their group therapists ) , they want to be magical minstrels with white on their skins and black on their souls . Paul Butterfield is their hero , but he does n't share their fantasy . Paul never wanted to be black ? just blue . " I never thought about Negroes ' lives , " he recalls . " I just thought about the feeling they made me feel . " That blue feeling was as familiar to Paul as his bedside radio . Just by turning the knobs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for even as late as the Fifties , Chicago was still the northern terminus of the Underground Railroad . From the Brazos Bottoms of Texas , the Cajun country of Louisiana and the sharecroppers ' shacks of Alabama , the bluesmen came , following the Mississippi north through the Delta to West Memphis , where they worked the tonk strip until they were ready to start on the second leg of their journey through East St. Louis , Kansas City and Indianapolis to the streets of Chicago 's South Side . Here some of them earned a scratch living in neon-smeared blues bars ; some froze to death in the streets . None of them could live for long in the city without changing his tune : the lonely , timeless hollers of the country being too easily drowned out in the uproar of the metropolis . The metamorphosis of the relaxed country blues into the aggressive , hard-driving urban blues was accomplished in Chicago . This was the city where Jimmy Yancey and Meade Lux Lewis drove the barrel-house boogie-woogie to the limits of percussive frenzy ; where Muddy Waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm section to lowdown Mississippi blues " ; and where Little Walter took up his har-  | monica in one hand , cupped a microphone in the other and blew his soul into them , transforming the delicate , melancholic " harp " into an excoriating Pan pipe wailing an electric goat song . There were legendary bluesmen in Chicago when Paul Butterfield was growing up , but it took him a while to realize that they were only a streetcar ride away . When he got the address straight , he did n't hesitate to make his move . With an emotion like awe , he remembers the first night he walked into Smitty 's Corner , on Thirty-ninth and Indiana , to hear the great Muddy Waters . No white man had ever had the nerve to go in that place , unless it were in the line of duty . Paul walked in bearing his passport on his face . It took a while for Muddy Waters and Howlin ' Wolf and Magic Sam and Little Walter to get used to this white kid hanging around ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night after night with his Hohner harmonica in his pocket , they displayed the unaffected generosity that Negroes often show white men who are genuinely dedicated to the black arts . They taught the boy blues in the traditional way it has been taught to generation after generation of black kids ? the way Blind Lemon Jefferson taught Lightnin ' Hopkins or Charlie Patton taught Roebuck Staple ? not by demonstrating or explaining , but by letting the boy sit with them , hip by haunch , listening and imitating , feeling his way into the body heat of the older men . Not surprisingly , Paul Butterfield turned out to be the one white musician of his generation who could really play the blues . Unlike his less assured contemporaries , who betray their ignorance or insensibility by playing too much and too fast , who riddle off a dozen cliches in as many bars and disclose to a discerning ear a dubious sense of time , Butterfield has had always a true sense of the real thing , even when he was too young or too inexperienced to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own band ( a white group with a black rhythm section ) and cut his first LPs , he showed rare good taste in his selection of traditional  | material and even rarer modesty in his simple , unpretentious phrasing and restrained singing . Lacking a traditional blues voice , one of those voices that are as tough and gnarled as an old tree on a windy hill , Paul hollered through his harmonica , tagging himself with his first phrases as the man to watch . Now the whole country is watching him , and his decision to ripen naturally has paid off . A couple of weeks ago , at that sweet-cider barrelhouse , the Cafe au Go Go , Butterfield touched an audience of blues devotees with a voice that is now yearning and doleful , pleading , " Baby , baby , baby , " with a tender urgency that very few of our female singers can muster . Stronger too is his harp , shivering and shaking in a slow drag or cresting triumphantly on the roller-coaster ride of an up-tempo jam . Like Jimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and King 's Row geariness has refreshed and enriched the blues , Butterfield is seeking a contemporary fusion of highly colored sounds . His blues collage is pasted together out of black New York jazz of the early Sixties , blue Memphis soul of the late Sixties , and moire-screen orientalisms from Frisco ' 67 . The base remains unmistakably blues : " I 'll always be playing the blues , " Butterfield promises , " because that 's what I hear in my head . " The new Butterfield Blues Band is suffused with casual joy . They loaf all over the stage like a bunch of Okies at the general store . Butterfield , a recessed soloist no more , leads them powerfully with his own singing and playing and with his physical presence , swaying before the drummer , doing a haunchy strut during a rhythmic solo or jiving with a musician who is struggling to get into a new bag . At the climactic moments , the band ? rocking with the ebullience and confidence of youth at the throttle ? bounces its chords off the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls the great Kansas City blues bands of twenty years ago . A permissive presence who never plans a set and gives the " go " sign to any man who feels like taking a solo excursion ,  | Paul Butterfield runs one real risk as a leader : that of allowing his band 's powerful centrifugal energies to overwhelm the centripetal . The real beauty of a blues band arises from the fact that it is a band and not just a revolving stage from which a series of performers can deliver Pirandello monologues . What is worse , most of Butterfield 's players ? unlike their leader ? have an irresistible urge to swim out beyond their depth . Several of them ? notably Buzzy Feiten , a girlishly beautiful nineteen-year-old guitarist , and Gene Dinwiddie , a mature tenor man who wields his axe and wears his hat like an old-time jazzbo ? are proficient blues soloists ; but when they attempt the highly sophisticated jazz styles developed in this city by Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane , they reveal an immaturity and , one might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener to take . ( Jazz fans will reflect bitterly on the fact that when the masters of these styles were at the height of their powers , their collegiate audiences were so intimidated by black power that they drifted away , allowing the musicians to fade into oblivion or die in poverty ; but now when this same vein is worked crudely by a predominantly white blues band , the boys and girls applaud and cheer . ) Blues leads to jazz , most naturally into the kind of jump-band jamming at which Paul Butterfield or Albert King excel ; and even the most surrealistic jazz sustains affinities with basic blues ? a fact demonstrated dramatically six years ago when Ornette Coleman jammed with a Harlem rhythm and blues band at Town Hall ; but today blues and jazz are two different games , and the men who can play one to perfection may sound when they try the other like amateurs . A more promising use of the Butterfield Band 's resources on behalf of the blues is suggested by the richly atmospheric " Last Hope 's Gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Pierrot Lunaire . The dusky , sinuous opening , with its swaying bass and low gong-like piano chords , leads into a dirge for horns that recalls Ornette Coleman 's " Lonely Woman . " There are the same hard dissonant  | voices , the same broken blue notes , cutting like shards of splintered glass ; but all these sounds are used to frame a freeform blues which Butterfield sings in anguished vocal patterns that rise and fall , clench and let go , like the silhouette of a black woman sobbing behind a window blind . Though the arty lyrics sometimes spoil the effect , the composition as a whole vindicates the band 's adoption of the avant-garde jazz idiom ? not as the new language of the blues but as a clamorously tragic antiphon . Ten years ago when Paul Butterfield was floating lonely as a cloud across Chicago 's black ghetto , the Generation was huddled around jukeboxes digging Fabian and Frankie Avalon and rocking maniacally in white ducks and bucks . Today , the Generation , clad in sad rags , shuffles off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bad-mouth , badluck , bad-time blues . The contagion of Butterfield 's dream has spread , but America 's foremost Blue Boy has refused to surrender to the big sleep of fame . Packing his bags with sounds from all over America , herding his boys into their beat-up buses , Hyde Park Paul goes out to blaze a new trail through the still fecund wilderness of the blues . New York , 1968  | L ONG , LONG AGO , when America was still a land of brutal innocence , there stood upon the banks of the Mississippi a city of carnal delight . Bearing an Egyptian name and luxuriating in Nilotic heat , Memphis was a country boy 's Cairo . Every Saturday night , plow jockeys and parlor belles , mule skinners and factory frills poured into the city , making its streets roil with the tumultuous human tides of a Mardi Gras . Swarming along that famous midway , Beale Avenue , white and black , rich and poor , were beckoned on by dozens of gingerbread palaces and clapboard cribs . Whether the visitor craved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a plain hog-nosed restaurant , a gambling hell crowded with fancy men playing cooncan rummy or a cheap stag poolroom , he was sure to find it along the ten bawdy blocks of Black America 's Main Street . No less proverbial than the pleasures of Beale were its plangent sounds . The jumbling of electric pianos with windup Victrolas , of shouting congregations with howling bluesmen , of strolling guitar pickers with scrounging jug bands ,  | constituted the South 's most celebrated symphony . Rising in a dense , pungent cloud over Memphis , these sounds of a jubilant humanity soared high into the ionosphere , lingering there for decades , while the Avenue below crumbled into silence . Then , just when the last saloon had been boarded over , the last theater darkened , the once-flamboyant population reduced to a single survivor ? " the Cat on Beale " ( an ancient pimp in porkpie hat , balloon pants and toothpick shoes still seen occasionally limping along the desolate street , lined now with shabby pawnshops crammed with discarded horns and fiddles ) ? that invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic magic and by this generation 's longing for the good-time years . Spun out of the grooves of a hundred million records and spread across the country by a hundred million speakers , the Memphis Soul Sound enfolds the nation now like an evangelical tent , rocking with hymns to the newly proclaimed brotherhood of black man and white man in modern America . The roots of soul music ? a fusion of gospel , blues and jazz ? are black , but its most extensive audience is white . " Audience " is not really the right word to suggest the relation of the white public , particularly the youth , to this music . The word implies a passive spectator relationship ; whereas , in fact , no music public in history has ever made a style so completely a part of its life . The kids who were once content merely to listen and dance to the sounds of Ray Charles and Little Richard have moved on to adopt a whole new identity of black gesture and language ? of black shouts and black lips , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in their rooms soaking their souls in blues , they are jammed into a rock theater , sitting hip by haunch , clapping , stomping and shouting like the congregation of a storefront church . Or they are wriggling and writhing in a stroboscopic snake pit , doing barrel-house rent party steps that were first cut half a century ago . There is something providential about the occurrence of this musical miscegenation just at the moment when the  | races seem most dangerously sundered . Driven apart in every other area of national life by goads of hate and fear , black and white are attaining within the hot embrace of soul music a harmony never dreamed of in earlier days . Yet one wonders if this identification is more than skin deep . What are the kids doing ? Are they trying to pass ? Are they color blind ? Do they expect to attain a state of black grace ? Let 's put it bluntly : how can a pampered , milk-faced , middleclass kid who has never had a hole in his shoe sing the blues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in poverty and misery ? Recently , I popped these questions to Janis Joplin , this generation 's campy little Sophie Tucker , born and reared on the right side of the tracks at Port Arthur , Texas . An auburn-haired Whitey who belts the blues like some big fat mama throwing her meat in a Billy show , Janis is this generation 's favorite culture creole . " Why do you work in vocal black face ? " I asked . Her answer surprised me by its frankness and self-awareness . She conceded that her style was derived from Bessie Smith , Big Mae Bell , Mama Mae Thornton and Mavis Staple . It all went back to her youth when she imitated Bessie Smith records at parties . She discovered then that when she put on her black voice ( as opposed to her choir voice or her white pop voice ) , she experienced a thrilling sense of release . Convinced that anything that felt so good could n't be bad , she went on to develop her own music working behind this protective facade . Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first because she is beginning to discover her own identity . In any case , she concludes , " being black for a while will make me a better white . " As I pondered her answer , it struck me that she had articulated this generation 's great secret . They are not trying to pass . They are trying to save their souls . Adopting as a tentative identity the firmly set , powerfully expressive mask of the black man , the confused , conflicted and frequently selfdoubting and self-loathing offspring of Mr. and Mrs. Amer-  | ica are released into an emotional and spiritual freedom denied them by their own inherited culture . Now that they have sprung the locks clamped on the youth of previous generations , anything may happen ? which is why everyone is so uptight about the youth , showering them with unmerited praise and blame . What is most likely to happen , however , is just what Mama Joplin prophesies : the white kids will swing back into their own tradition , fortified and enlightened by the adventure of transvestism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black skins , and while their brethren labor along in the Delta mud , these quick-change artists are turning out in startling new shades of white . Super-Whitey No. i is Stevie Winwood , formerly the lead in Blind Faith , now the boss of Traffic . When Stevie Winwood became famous some years ago , working with the Spencer Davis blues band , his vocal style was black on black . A fey little pixie , who looks as if he was reared under a mushroom in the Midlands , Stevie was a racial changeling . Night and day he sat in his dank basement apartment listening to his black and blue records , pretending that he was Ray Charles crying in an illiterate voice out of the heart of darkness . When he got the chance to cut " I 'm a Man , " " Ca n't Get Enough of It , " and " Gim me Some Lovin ' , " he piled every black sound he loved on each tiny 45 . Combining the lurid organ of the Harlem show bar with the clanking cowbell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet-skin drums of Motown and the gospel 's chorus of hypnotic Amen girls , capping the whole mix with his own shouts and hollers , delivered around a plug of soggy , juicy Mail Pouch . Attaining a deeper shade of black than any dyed by Negro hands , Stevie Winwood became the Pied Piper of Soul . Then he began to undergo a metamorphosis not to be found in Ovid . Recording with his own band , Traffic , he produced astonishing records , like " Shanghai Noodle Factory , " spotlighting a voice that was high , keen , clean and out of its mind . Picking up steam from his years under the cork ,  | Stevie had obviously developed the confidence and freedom of soul that allowed him to go soaring off into a new style that owed nothing , save intensity , to black tradition . On his recent records with Blind Faith , he has worked that high , white wail around to a weird warlock sound that sends the listener 's mind tripping off the paths of space and time to fasten on remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that once a man has slipped his original moorings , he can go where he pleases and be what he pleases to the uttermost limits of the human imagination . The New York Times , 1969  | And He Keeps His Ukelele in a Shopping Bag TINY TIM TINY Tim is a lost lithograph by Toulouse-Lautrec . Blowing kisses like a flustered diva to the rowdy , laughing crowd at a midtown discotheque , performing like a trained marmoset before the tough , tattooed girls in a downtown lesbian bar , shrilling high like Amelita Galli-Curci on the Johnny Carson Tonight show , he and his vocal vaudeville always conjure up the year 1910 , the Moulin Rouge and the gay , innocently coquettish world of the Chocolate Man and Jane Avril . But what am I saying ? Tiny Tim belongs not to an age but to an ancient tradition that stretches back from the gaslit stages of the Victorian period through the Commedia dell ' Arte and the privileged jesters of Shakespeare ? Feste and Touchstone ? to the Breton minstrels , the medieval jongleurs and on back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed with a single voice and body the romance of patrician boy and slave girl . What lifts Tiny Tim miles above the nostalgia , the rickey-tick , the pop archeology of even the finest rock groups , the Beatles , the  | Stones , the Lovin ' Spoonful , is that where they are doing an " impression " of something they hardly know , he is directly in touch with a musical and theatrical past that speaks from his mouth with the frightening authority of a dybbuk . Born Herbert Kauhry and answering all queries about his age with the absolutely accurate answer " ageless , " Tiny Tim has performed since he was five the old songs that constitute his current repertory . The " glorious voice " of Henry Burr singing " Beautiful Ohio " on an old Columbia Bluebird was the first music , he recalls , that " struck an impression on me . " Wound up by his mother on an ancient Victrola , this record and others of the same vintage by Arthur Fields ( the first crooner ) , Eddie Morton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) played over and over in his old-fashioned home , until they fused with his deepest feelings and household pieties . Later they blended with the songs of Rudy Vallee , Gene Austin , Ruth Etting and Annette Hanshawe in a world of song that possesses him still in this age of electronic wizardry and futuristic funkiness . Yet only today could Tiny Tim have become a famous entertainer . Even a few years ago , as he made the rounds of Tin Pan Alley , from the Brill Building to 165o Broadway , ducking that zany head with the long hair into the offices of old cigar-chompers and trilling , " Hello , my dear friends , I have a demo in my hand of the next big hit , " growls of impatience and scorn were all he received . Dreary little clubs in the Village , like the Fat Black Pussy Cat , Page Three and The Third Side , were the only places he could work ; and what difference did it make if people like the Stones and Bob Dylan came in to dig him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved him from obscurity ; for the first time in generations , young people began to long for something pure and sweet and gay ? a creature devoid of conventional beauty and glamour but possessed of an irresistible ugly-duckling charm . Such innocence was half the  | appeal of the early Beatles ; Ringo was their duckling . Nor was the longing lost when the boys soured their style with the cynical sounds of " Tax Man . " Even as acid rock reached its weird apocalypse , fuzz and feedback , Angst and shreck roaring in an appalling Witches ' Sabbath , the yearning for all the opposite qualities , the giddy childish joys of the nursery , the fun and make-believe of the toy theater and the puppet show , grew apace . Today , when Tiny Tim walks out on the stage , he still gets Iots of laughs , lots of tittering and elbow-in-the-ribs condescension ; but it 's just the flotsam on a great , rolling wave of love that breaks over his head with his first kisses and curtsies . Even those who ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cuticle . He has the most fascinating face in show business ? a Janus face that flickers with the allegory of evil and innocence that underlies all his art , all those confrontations between melodramatic villains and helpless , quivering maidens . Sometimes he looks like Fagin , with his long kinky hair , enormous hooked beak and long white witch 's teeth ; then he reaches into his paper shopping bag , removes his ukelele , wrapped carefully in an old cardigan , and suddenly he 's everybody 's Jewish grandmother . Tiny Tim is a light show : everyone has a different vision of him . St. Theresa in drag is the way he appears on the cover of his recent album God Bless Tiny Tim , a smiling ecstatic , standing stiffly on a mound of Easter-basket grass and rolling his eyes up to a heaven that beams sunshine through the clouds . Tiny Tim is really a holy freak : how splendid that today the word should be a term of endearment and unabashed admiration . For bizarreness is an essential part of his tradition : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands an answering contortion of personality that is the performer 's equivalent of the submissive self-abnegation of the saint . Like all holy men , Tiny Tim is inviolable . Even in the mocking arena of the Tonight show , he behaved with the perfect freedom from inhibition , with the absolute im-  | perviousness to ridicule that must have been the style of the ancient Christians in the Roman amphitheater . He reduced Johnny Carson to his straight man with a few childlike answers ; Carson , his radar scanning the house , realized immediately that Tiny Tim 's obvious vulnerability made him an untouchable . Asked to do an encore , Tiny Tim did n't even bother to rise from the guest 's chair ; he cocked up his uke , lifted his mad face in the air and went into a soprano fantasia on " The birds are coming " that was as finely focused , as technically flawless as the carefully insulated products of the recording studio . If you watch him carefully , you will see that Tiny Tim has always that inviolable space around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sides , his feet touching , as if he learned to play in a niche on a cathedral wall . What people got to see for the first time on the Carson show was the totality of Tiny Tim 's absorption in his role . Far from playing a part onstage , he is always the same raree bird , whether he is jabbering in his room at his parents ' house in New York or talking before the millions on TV . When he stepped up on the platform to meet " Mr. " Carson ( he even says " Mr. Rudy Vallee " ) , he simply continued what he began at stage center . Gleefully , he told how every day he bathes with Packer 's Pine Tar Soap ; how he brushes his teeth with papaya powder ( never rinsing his mouth ) ; how he concocts his magic diet of wheat germ , honey , pumpkin and sunflower seeds ; and how he loves the Dodgers and the Leafs and " all those beautiful girls . " It was as vivid as a personal revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . Tiny Tim has never sounded better than he does on God Bless . Richard Perry , the record producer , did a remarkable job of contextualizing the artist 's essence within the ambiance of psychedelically inspired rock music . The album is a dream theater that echoes beguilingly with all Tiny Tim 's voices : the cackling twenties tone of Lee Morse , going " dodo-dee-do " ; the straw-hat bel canto of George M. Cohan ;  | and the drollery of Billy Murray and Ada Jones , he with his Iolling minstrel 's voice and she with the tremolo-ridden sound of Lydia Pinkham femininity lining out Sonny Bono 's 1912 hit , " I 've Got You , Babe . " To say that these are the most perfect impersonations of old singers ever heard would hardly do justice to the art that has re-embodied these entertainers in electronic avatars , summoning them up out of the past to caper again before a strobe-lit oleo . After an enchanting hour filled with the mysterious delight of recognizing what you never remember hearing , you will say with Tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The New York Times , 1968  | NovocAINE LIP .

" To an unimpeachably dignified American corporation , the Singer Sewing Machine Company , he has accorded the privilege of dishing up his carefully embalmed Roaring Boy as a Christmas turkey , stuffed with old chestnuts and recently rendered soul suet . Whatever one thinks of the singer 's current style ? a tortuous passage between the Scylla of incipient obesity and the Charybdis of tachycardia ? the show is a triumph for the Colonel , the final vindication of his old carny man 's philosophy . For the maintenance of the classic Presley image in these troubled times has been an arduous task . Thank God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every movie to his ante-bellum mansion at Memphis , there to re-  | create himself with wholesome sports like touch football and wholesome foods like peanut butter , while he communes with his circle of handsome young companions , so grossly dubbed " the Memphis Mafia . " No , the Colonel has had no trouble with Private Presley . The problems have been created by the vulgarians of the music business , who have applied formidable pressures to make Presley conform with the corruptions of contemporary civilization . It has been said that the Hillybilly Lollipop 's monastic existence behind Graceland 's fence of wrought-iron eighth notes has distanced him from the pop scene and threatened his currency as a culture hero . What balderdash ! There is no finer currency than the American dollar . Measured in dollars , Elvis Presley has greater currency today than at any other time in his career . For the past ten years the Colonel has paced Elvis through a course of moviemaking that would break the wind of a derby winner . Three times a year Elvis Presley has gone to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with holiday titles like Blue Hawaii , Fun in Acapulco , Viva Las Vegas , Tickle Me , Easy Come , Easy Go , Live a Little , Love a Little and , the latest in the series , Chautauqua . For each film Elvis receives a million dollars in wages and 5o per cent of the profits . The money does n't stop there , however ; every film yields an LP soundtrack record which may sell as many as two million copies . With the Colonel exploiting the merchandising gimmicks suggested by each new role ( everything from mannish sweatshirts to girlish pink teddy bears ) , with the royalties pouring in from Elvis 's thirty gold records , and with residuals and replays and remakes and reissues from all the golden years , when Elvis and the Colonel grossed as much as $35 million in a single year , why should anyone ridicule the old Colonel and his cigar ? Is Elvis not the highest-paid star in Hollywood ? Has Elvis not sold 200 million records in this country alone ? Is Elvis 's baby daughter not cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we all be  | grateful ? For an enormous percentage of everything Elvis earns goes back to the people in taxes , making the Colonel the best de facto treasurer this country has seen since the days of Andy Mellon . The Colonel 's success as pop music 's greatest tax collector rests , of course , on this country 's willingness to work hard to support its habits . More precisely , the Presley success story may be traced to a very important and hitherto neglected cultural factor in ourselves : IPA , Indefinitely Prolonged Adolescence . The way IPA works is that when people reach the years between eighteen and twenty , when they put away childish things and go on to college , they suffer cultural arrest . They stop reading Mad . They stop putting quarters in jukeboxes . They let dust accumulate on their 45 'S . Presumably , they 're going on to better things , higher things ; actually , they 're leaving a knot in their lifeline which at some later date they will slide back to . Then as they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities , they get a hankering for the good old junk . They 're rooting around in the basement one day and they uncover a stack of long-ignored records . Hey ! here 's " Rip It Up , " " Hound Dog , " " Heartbreak Hotel . " Let 's bring them upstairs and slip them on the phonograph . Woops ! It 's Elvis , out-of-breath , rattling to pieces , echoing like doomsday and shouting , " Baybeh ! " Next thing you know you 're up on your feet and you 're doing the hucklebuck and your wife comes in , and it 's a whole thing , and the kid is crying , and what the hell ! . . . Whew , I ca n't breathe , but was n't that fun ? Picture generation after generation going through that experience , every five-year block in the population pyramid , and after a while you get a pretty strange image of contemporary society . A giant layer cake or , better , a plane stack over Kennedy , with every generation going round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people next door . And then imagine whole generations relapsing together , suddenly  | waking up to find the current pop sound too thin , too anemic or sentimental or pretentious and then hankering for the good old days , for the shlocky Fifties when the whole rock thing worked so much better ? and , well , there you have the current pop scene . Today all those English groups that spent years whoring after strange gods are making pilgrimages to the pop mecca in Memphis . The Beatles have revived their original Presleyladen style and the Stones are into the baby-blanket thing too and so are a lot of kids who were n't even around in 1956 . So the Elvis special becomes a very , well , special kind of program , a marker , a reminder , a coarsely pious Christmas card which demands some appropriate response . Might we suggest a solemn " Yeah ! " and a single exquisitely positioned finger-pop ? ELVIS PRESLEY AT LAS VEGAS Gorgeous ! ? or some equally effusive effeminate word ? is the only way to describe Elvis Presley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Marlene Dietrich stunned the ringsiders with the sight of those legs encased from hip to ankle in a transparent gown has any performer so electrified this jaded town with a personal appearance . Without twanging a string , burbling a note or offering a hint of hip , Elvis transfixed a tough opening-night audience of flacks and entertainers simply by striding onstage in the Costume of the Year . What was he wearing ? Nothing lavish , my dear , just a smashing white jump suit , slashed to the sternum and lovingly fitted around his broad shoulders , flat belly , narrow hips and . . . well , it 's a nice fit . And then there are his pearls ? loads of lustrous pearls , not sewn on his costume but  | worn unabashedly as body ornaments . Pearls coiling in thick bunches around his neck , pearls girdling his tapered waist in a fabulous karate belt : rope of pearl alternating with rope of gold , the whole sash tied over one hip with the ends brushing his left knee . With his massive diamonds flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing sheepishly through his huge shag of shiny black hair , Elvis looks like a heaping portion of male cheesecake ripe for the eyeteeth of the hundreds of women ogling him through opera glasses . So dazzling is the superstar , so compelling is his immaculate narcissism , that you hardly notice the massive forces he has mustered for his support : the thirty-eight-piece orchestra stacked up like the Las Vegas Philharmonic , the front rank of black-clad Memphis Mafiosi , armed with guitars and drums , and the side-show chorus of eight integrated voices ( the Sweet Inspirations and the Imperials ) . Elvis kicks off his show James Brown style by collaring the mike and shaking it to the beat of " I 'm All Shook Up , " the kettledrumming orchestra shaking its elephantine body behind him . Coming to the guitar break , he strums the acoustic instrument slung white around his neck with the carelessness of a practiced faker . The number ends abruptly with Presley snapping into profile and thrusting his guitar bayonet-wise at the chorus . The rest of the evening passes smoothly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in elaborately upholstered arrangements of his new anthems . Every number ends with a classically struck profile ? Elvis as the Discus Hurler , Elvis as Sagittarius , Elvis as the Dying Gaul . Between poses , he offers glimpses of his wry humor : " My mouth 's so dry , feels like Bob Dylan slept in it all night . " Not quite the erotic politician that Jim Morrison proved to be when he let it all hang out , Elvis manages very well with his constituency by occasionally grabbing a blue-haired lady at ringside and kissing her firmly on the mouth . Watching the women in the audience lunge toward the stage like salmon leaping up a falls becomes the show 's real comic relief .  | The climax of Presley 's monodrama is a tremendous Cecil B. DeMille tableau . The orchestra is silhouetted against a cerulean-blue cyclorama while its members are transfigured by rich gold light pouring in from the wings . As the massed musicians sustain a mighty cathedral chord , the Great White Hope falls on one knee in the classic Jolson-gladiator pose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the house , with its three-dimensional putti stringing yards of swagging chiffon between plastic classic columns . Grander than the " Fountainblue , " grosser than Grossinger 's , the International Hotel , the ultimate motel , 1,5oo rooms redolent more of Howard Johnson than Howard Hughes , has found itself an " attraction " magnetic enough to pull the shut-in generation over thirty out of their ranch houses onto nonstop jets and down into the Valley of Loose Gold where the King of the Oldy-Moldy-Goldys presides over his people with eternal youth and joy and jamboree . The New York Times , ? 968 , and Life , 1970  | CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL WTH THE SWOOPING jet sound of the Beatles ' " Back in the U.S.S.R. , " rock ' n ' roll has come home again . The music whose future seemed once to lie among the distant stars of the international crowd with Karlheinz Stockhausen and Ravi Shankar has come back to roost with those tough old yardbirds Chuck Berry and Little Richard . In London , John Lennon , a twenty-eight-year-old millionaire and member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of his teen dream pad , wiggles his bare toes and listens to " Angel Baby " and " Give Me Love " by Rosie and the Originals , favorites of the early Fifties . High above Manhattan in the plastichappy Hotel Hilton , the four sturdy lumbermen who constitute the Creedence Clearwater Revival , this year 's top American rock band , drink beer out of a Styrofoam cooler and enthusiastically recall the Crows and the Meadowlarks , favorites of the middle Fifties . What threw this loop into the time machine ? Lots of things . Like any pop art , rock could only be sophisticated so  | far . Beyond this , the rock essence began to bleach out and evaporate . The kids and the blacks would n't listen to the music ; the musicians themselves did not know how to carry it forward . Then the crash : the creeds of modern youth , the theosophies that had inspired the rapid-fire innovations of recent years ? the hippie scene , the acid scene , the Maharishi , Zen ? began to crumble . Left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to go back home . ( Actually , the decision was a delight ; it was a chance to spin the old R &B; sides and be kids again . As John Lennon said when quizzed about the stacks of ragged 45S in his flat : " These are the records I dug then , I dig them now and I 'm still trying to reproduce Some Other Guy ' or ' Be-Bop-ALula . ' " ) " Reproduce , " however , means something very different on each side of the Atlantic . Reared 3,000 miles from their spiritual homeland , the Beatles view America ? as did Brecht and Weill before them ? as an endless movie crammed with bang-bang outlaws and kiss-kiss cuties . Parodists rather than paraphrasers , the English lads fill the gaps between their songs and their heroes with laughing gas . American rockers are too pious for the put-on ; like crazy counterfeiters intent on one-upping the Treasury , their goal is to produce an R &B; sound that is even more authentic to contemporary ears than the classics themselves . Creedence Clearwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fifties right in the grooves . A hoarse , sandpaper-throated lead singer ( obviously some faceless old black who has long since drunk himself to death ) is shouting in front of a grimly twanging , solemnly stomping spasm band ; the theme of his song is curses , spells , apparitions ? heavy , angsty stuff that points straight back to the days when Screamin ' Jay Hawkins was borne onto the stage of the Apollo Theater enclosed in a black coffin . As the band pounds out its lugubrious rhythm and the guitars shake with malarial chills , the Emperor Jones drama of the primitive , superstitious Negro is enacted . The singer 's voice rises in  | unlettered shouts and screams , the ominous beat tramps ever closer , the terrors of a simple soul ? the " haunt " walking on the water , the woman walking out the door ? drive his voice into a poetry of fear that cracks the numb resignation of the blues . What comes to mind after you have reflected on these scenes is that they are being played with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the Negro soul is derived from the same source as the Beatles ' : those old 78s and 45S that have served this generation as sacred texts , esthetic talismans and racial/political rallying points . Amazing is the mastery of the black idiom which groups like the Creedence display ; even more impressive is the modesty and artistic integrity with which they manipulate an alien tradition . Eschewing the politics of drugs , sex or race ; turning their backs on theatricalism or exhibitionism ; holding themselves down to the hard dense core at the heart of the rock , they burn through the trash that is being spewed from the radio today in a veritable pollution of the airwaves . Clear water is their symbol for purity , and purity is , paradoxically , what they achieve working with the stuff that is black as perfect pitch . Life , 1969  | Pr Music today is being transformed by the esthetic of pop art . That sounds like tautology but it is the formula for a revolution . No longer does the pop musician go round and round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No longer does the pop genius go mad from imprisonment of imagination or betray his integrity by dragging his piano onto the stage of Carnegie Hall to make with the Grieg concerto in ragtime . Now , thanks to the freaky contortions of contemporary sensibility , a commercial musician can grow and develop as an artist without abandoning the simple popular music that established his fame and earned him his millions . Slipping over their eyes the subtly distorting lenses of irony and nostalgia and taking ever more sophisticated sightings of their original tunes and times , groups like the Beatles are now filling the airways with sly pop facsimiles such as John Lennon 's " Come Together " from the recent Abbey Road . Heard out of the corner of your mind while driving the car , " Come Together " is just a catchy bit of jungle music  | with a mean whisk of vocal hiss , a hypnotic beat and the Lennon voice chanting on one note through a speaking tube . Endless repetition brings out the words like lemon juice on invisible writing , bit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( there 's a Fifties word for you ! ) , some great old cat who has grooved right down to the present with his " juju eyeball , " hair down to his knees and heavy mystic words of Rosko philosophy : " One and one and one is three ! " The song hits you as a good-natured put-on of the whole funky , boogie , bluesy soul bag ? pop music 's big , black sacred cow . You love the line " He got to be good-looking ' cos he 's so hard to see . " Then in the third verse , the put-on switches suddenly from the soulman to the song 's audience and to Lennon himself ; for what are those cryptic lines ? " He bag production/he got walrus gumboot/he got Ono sideboard " ? if not John 's private jokes with his Oriental missus ( their film company is called Bag Productions ) and his wellknown public sass , here making millions strain to catch the meaning of nonsense ? Just as a mocking fantasia on the idea of being super-hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? not least the refrain , " Come together , " an obvious pun with a tricky hook ? " Coming Together " is a hexagram of the I Ching , the rock world 's favorite oracle . How 's them apples , Elvis ? Abbey Road is not one of the Beatles ' great albums but it contains lots of good things : " Oh ! Darling , " a ritually perfect parody of a classic R &B; ballad by Paul McCartney ; " Something , " a sentimental tune by George Harrison with a plangently rising guitar phrase off the 1939 shortwave from London ; and " Octopus Garden , " a little ditty by Ringo Starr that reminds me of " The Icecaps are Melting " by that other ugly duckling , Tiny Tim . The album 's B side is devoted almost entirely to a medley of Lennon and McCartney tunes . This cornucopia of melodies and countermelodies , of brief snatches of song and bits of heavily orchestrated padding seems symbolic of the Beatles ' latest phase , which might be described as the round-the-clock produc- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases are lovely , some of the segues stirring , but what sustains the production is a strong updraft of show-biz inflation that fills the mind with fleeting half-glimpses of Forties movie musicals , of Betty Grable , Alice Faye , thousands of marching soldiers ? hold it ! The Beatles were babies when those stars were born ! Life , 1969  | That Angry Kid Has Gone All Over Romantic BOB DYLAN Nashville Skyline is Bob Dylan through rose-tinted shades . The ruddy hues of health , virility and rustic serenity fairly drench the cover photo ( which looks like it was shot in a Tahitian sunset or through a Doris Day rejuvenation scrim ) . Instead of the old wintry image , the new Dylan is just a step ahead of spring . No more the Kid , trampling along the dusty highways of the East Village , casting a mournful , scornful glance over a shoulder bedecked with a carelessly flung waif-scarf , this beatified Dylan is handsome and bearded , a smiling Mormon-Shaker who pushes up the brim of his country hat with a thumb that practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearty sleeve , the atmosphere is no less warm and genial . Dylan is in love and the emotion has changed his voice . The classic nasal tone has cleared up like last winter 's strep throat , and with it has gone the old anger , irony and humor . Instead of a Scotch-American Presbyterian Covenanter Hilly-Billy scraggle-neck chicken-skin mountain prophet man , the new rubicund Dylan is a relaxed country  | " bo " whose " Lay , lady , lay across my big brass bed " barreltone is enriched with faint echoes of Darktown sweet talk . What is most remarkable about this metempsychotic album is not simply the change it has wrought in Dylan 's image but the revolution it has made in his art . Dylan of yore was possessed of glossolalia , afflicted with logorrhea ; he used more words per song than any man since W. S. Gilbert . His music and his singing were just a rough-skinned conveyer belt on which he heaped the riches of his verbal imagination . Snarling and hollering , fleering and jeering , he cranked out more symbols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowery of Beat poets . Now he 's lost the gift of gab . Rock 's greatest rhetorician has become a mouther of romantic cliches . " Love is all there is , " he mindlessly croons , and you wonder what happened to the squinteyed distrustfulness ( and honesty ) of : " Are you for real , baby , or are you just on the shelf ? /I 'm looking deep into your eyes , but all I can see is myself . " Has Dylan " matured , " as a good many of the early reviewers happily report ? or has he just gone soft as apple butter ? The test is clearly the tunes themselves , which in this album carry the weight once borne by Dylan 's poetry . The songs range from the maudlin " Girl from the North Country " ( Dylan and Johnny Cash swaying beneath a lamppost at three A.M. ) through the lime-tart , gittar-twanging " Country Pie " to the deftly campy " Peggy Day , " all straw-hat throwaway lines and goony goofy steel-guitar glissandos . Every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( perhaps the word is " put over " ) , but the materials from which they have been made are paper-thin and plainly derivative . Dylan 's ditty bag is patched together from Country &; Western cliches and his delivery is not quite good enough to be believed . He comes on either as a semipro entertainer lightheartedly recollecting Grand Ole Opry , or he 's a sandlot lover self-consciously revealing a newly won masculinity that somehow seems to sit on Bob Dylan like the first growth of beard on a teenage boy .  | As a lark for the performer ( long due for a change from his dronelike musical accompaniments ) and a vacation for his hard-worked listeners ( swamped with ironies and ambiguities ) , this collection of barroom and bedroom ballads has an obvious appeal . Take away the consciousness , however , that this strange voice is actually the legendary Bob Dylan doing the switch of the year and the music on these tracks tends to fade into insignificance . Significance is precisely what Nashville Skyline is packed with for people who are apprehensive about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performer of the shrewdness of Bob Dylan can delude himself into thinking his former style ? tough , complex and wholly original ? was merely the product of " big city " influences operating on a basically simple and bucolic temperament , then there is every reason to believe that the whole pop music scene may soon slide inexorably back into the slough of sentimentality from which it was lifted a number of years ago when the first hard rockers began their program of rural electrification . Life , 1969  | Flom THE shlocky early Sixties to the messianic advent of the Doors , American pop music was dominated by that great Detroit hit factory , Motown . From millions of car radios and jukeboxes rumbled the earthquake beat , shrilled the glassine strings , rasped and croaked , hollered and harmonized the voices of Diana Ross and the Supremes , Smokey Robinson and the Miracles , the Four Tops , the Temptations , Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye ? dramatis personae of an endless ghetto psychodrama focused on the themes of rejection , persecution , isolation and all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to run out of gas . The white market was lured away by the siren song of San Francisco ; the black began to divide its attentions among the great soul triumvirate of James Brown , Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding , singers whose earthy , direct appeal made the sequinspangled Angst of Detroit seem artificial . When Detroit started to retool to meet the competition , more trouble developed : the great team of Eddie and Brian Holland and La-  | mont Dozier , who created the Motown formula and stamped out most of the big hits , got involved in a legal hassle with Berry Gordy , Jr. , Motown 's proprietor , and eventually left the company . Nobody seriously expected Detroit could ever again exert the same influence on American music ; but last winter the bottom fell out of the hippies and the Mississippies , and Motown seized and held three of the top ten slots on the charts for seven consecutive weeks . Behind this spectacular comeback was the reshuffling of the Motown sound and the emergence of a new team of words-and-music men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Heard It Through the Grapevine , " " Cloud Nine " and " Run Away Child , Running Wild . " Their new formula is the projection of R &B's; traditionally harrowing material ? love betrayal , drug addiction , juvenile delinquency ? on a looming backdrop of hypnotically obsessive African rhythms and call notes . " Grapevine , " a solid-gold standard written originally for Gladys Knight and the Pips as a shouting , belting , uppercutting gospel number , has been transmogrified for Marvin Gaye so that it comes out a mysterious tom-tom-colored caravan song . " Cloud Nine " is built on the contrast between the driving maniacal rhythms of " normal " city life and the ecstatic transcendence of the drug high . When the Temptations sing " I 'm doin ' fine on cloud nine , " the image of junkie space floats off the hustling rhythmic base like an ancestral echo blown back from the jungle . Getting high and going back to the ancient tribal cool , the song suggests , are really one and the same thing . The most ambitious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor Jones treatment of the flight of a delinquent kid who finds himself alone at night in the city with neither money , food , friends nor a guiltless heart . The Temptations ' voices enter singly , like characters in a morality play , to mock , threaten and admonish the hapless Everyteen , and Whitfield and Strong build a rock drama which is more adventurous musically and more exciting dramatically than  | even the highly touted effort of the Who in their recent rock opera , Tommy . Nor is the drama confined to the convention of words and music : when the last voice has spoken , the song passes through a musical looking glass and emerges as a prolonged ritual of anxiety . It climbs relentlessly to a series of terrifying climaxes which impose on the racing rhythm of the boy 's heart the thunderous warning of the ancestral spirits to " go back home where you belong . " What these strange sounds from Detroit indicate is that Motown has once again laid its cross hairs on the heart of the urban American Negro . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perception that surpasses the best efforts of James Baldwin , Eldridge Cleaver , Rap Brown and all those who merely speak for the black man . The soul these songs have mirrored in the past was that of a man whose natural condition is anxiety . Now that anxiety has been amplified still further and counterpointed against a mysterious ancestral sound which promises salvation : the power to mount above the troubled present to a throne of pride and power beyond the white man 's ken . A jagged seam runs down the black man 's soul these days . Is he still a frightened and frantic " gray " scuffling to score in the white man 's world ? or is he an African prince , secure in the possession of magic arts and a wisdom too deep for words ? Life , 1969  | A COKE-JERKING RHYTHM , a Woody Woodpecker voice , a scoopful of cliches from a bin labeled " sweet talk " and you 've got ? bubble-gum music . This latest teen tic sounds like a tape echo of the early Beatles . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessiveness , the same white-bucked sound of boys and girls who do n't give a damn about " war and poverty and broken hearts and frustration " ? to quote a bubble-gum jacket that flaunts a photo of naked , silky-haired infants drooling on a white bearskin rug . There is only this difference : Beatlemania was a spontaneous phenomenon that caught everyone off guard and raised a sunken continent of youth culture before our astonished eyes . What is going on today with the really younger generation ? the kids of fourteen and below who dig the afternoon " spook operas " and freak for Sajid Khan ( an Oriental that even a suburban mother could love ) ? is neither spontaneous nor creative , though it may be just as representative of where these kids have their little heads . Bubble-gum  | music , like many other current teen phenomena , is the product of shrewd commercial operators . These Tin Pan Alley cats are constantly busy converting the gold of the rock music scene to the pure white teething plastic of prepubescent pop . The Big Bubble inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded groups called the 1910 Fruit Gum Company and the Lemon Pipers . A third group , the Ohio Express , hit pay dirt with sticky confections called " Yummy-Yummy " and " Chewy-Chewy . " Buddha claimed sales of over fourteen million . But the chief mercantile Svengali is Donnie Kirshner , a thirty-five-year-old hustler who employs teams of writers and arrangers to turn out the scores of songs which he wheels and deals onto the nation 's turntables . In the past decade , Kirshner has published 500 tunes , of which 400 made the hit charts . By using skilled professionals to concoct and record this music , Kirshner and his fellow tune snipes sidestep the problems posed by amateurish and temperamental rock groups . The Monkees were picked for their looks , paid for their success and played for originally by studio musicians who remained invisible and unknown . The Archies , whose bubble-gum albums ( including the Record of the Year , " Sugar , Sugar , " ) stick to the top of the charts , have n't even the histrionic reality of the Monkees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factitious music . Bubble-gum can not , however , be dismissed simply as commercial hype ? though that is the line taken by the older kids . Its creators hit upon a metaphor that may prove to be the most profound and prescient symbol of the coming generation . Every bubble-gum song proclaims the same primitive idea ? love is really eating ! " Yummy , yummy , yummy , I got love in my tummy , " nasalizes a juvenile Terry Southern , and an entire generation of naked lunchers chomps back in Barbie Doll beatitude . If the music were not so relentlessly innocent , the songs would be haled into court as the ultimate evidence of youthful degeneracy . Even so , they are  | masterpieces of that new Hollywood mode , the Clean Obscene . Imagine the little boy next door serenading your twelve-year-old daughter with this tasty jingle : " Oohwhee Chewy ? do n't know what you 're doin ' to me , but ' cher doin ' to me what I wan ' chew to . . . . Baby , do it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Shades of Portnoy in the playpen . Actually , the meaning of bubble-gum 's super metaphor is by no means confined to sexual innuendo ; it cuts to the core of that buried life led by our millions of subadolescents . Bubble-gum very aptly reduces these kids ' lives to maw ? to that juvenile mouth , ever open , ever consuming , never satisfied ; that yap that can never rap enough , eat enough or cry enough when its inordinate demands meet a momentary obstacle . A generation of galloping consumers could n't have a better theme song than these marshmallow melodies . The pity of bubble-gum is simply its total lack of nutrition . It comes in a whole rainbow of sugar-coated flavors , but soon the taste wears thin and all you 're left with is chewy , chewy , chewy ? plus a head full of cavities . Life , 1970  | NorsE is the subject of an intense but inaudible dialogue today . While some people crusade against horn-blowing and dream of rural crickets , others are so terrified of silence that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . Neither tribe of noise freaks , needless to say , has the slightest conception of the other 's needs . The acoustic sanitation workers who labor to cleanse the atmosphere of noise " pollution " fail to recognize modern man 's anxious craving for vital signs : for easily recognized , easily ignored signals that life flows on around him while he endures his existential isolation . And the roar-your-troublesaway boys fail just as completely to realize how their anarchic hubbub has mounted year by year until now we stand on the threshold of an era of mass deafness . The futility of the noise brigade 's favorite strategy of turning up the volume was demonstrated a couple of years ago when rock musicians experimented with acoustic overkill . Lining up as many as a score of heavy amps in a discotheque of modest proportions , the rockers flattened their  | well-stoned audiences with the heaviest decibel barrage in the history of music . The grand effect ? after the first delicious moment of masochistic surrender ? was simply numbness and a relativistic somersault that puts the listener back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ io . Today , there is a widespread reaction among musicians against any form of electric amplification ? and a sales boom in acoustic guitars . This same reaction against noise narcosis may account for the current interest in environmental sounds . One of the hottest underground records around is not a bootlegged disc of the Rolling Stones or a Dylan tape purloined from Columbia 's vaults , but an easily procured album titled Environments , which offers on its plug side " The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore " and on the flip side " The Optimum Avi-arY The " Seashore " is just what it promises to be : a half hour of rolling , rumbling , sibilantly expiring wave sounds . Sloshing through the portholes of a good stereo system at low gain , the effect is deeply satisfying ? less for what it does for the ear than for the associations with which it soaks the mind . Man 's obsession with the sea is so profound there is virtually no limit to the effects it can produce at work , after work , during dinner , over candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with patent medicines ? " cured my insomnia , " " fantastic for making love " ? cover the album with acclaim . Shrewd psychology and sophisticated computer programming have gone into the long-playing ocean . To produce its infinitely modulatable waves ( it can be played at any speed and still sound like an ocean ) , tapes of the Atlantic and the Pacific were laced together by a computer after having first been atomized into myriad sound grains . What emerged was a totally artificial " natural " sound that accomplishes what no natural sound could do under such unnatural conditions . Changing the ocean 's speed alters the sound from hi-fi facsimile ( at 45 rpm , the speed favored by sailors ) to Manto-  | vani languid ( 33 %3 rpm , the land lover 's tempo ) to surrealistic slow motion ( i 6 rpm ) and so to sleep . Altering the speed of " The Optimum Aviary , " thirty-two chirruping birds in cheery congress , has the effect of enlarging reverberant space around the happy creatures . From an ordinary room at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6o x 6o lecture hall and at 16 to a huge gymnasium filled with resonant birds big enough to terrify the bravest Gulliver . Problems still crop up in these synthetic environments : a recording of rain made listeners feel like the tub was running over . On another disc the drowsy hum of insects was gently putting the listener to sleep when the crickets spoiled the effect by suddenly changing speed . Even one successful record makes it clear , however , that the cacophony of the urban environment can be cosmetically masked with natural sound . Cheaper than booze , safer than pot , less monotonous than the hum of an air conditioner , the sounds of sea , rain , wind , birds and crickets may prove to be the ultimate tranquilizers . At the very least , they afford a welcome antidote to a world that has become ? to put it mildly ? a pain in the ear .

Finally , the twin drummers encamped in the midst of this commune begin to lay down a heavy , lurching beat , picked up piece by piece until the band is rocking in a bleary , boozy soul groove . While all these preliminary rituals are being performed , you search this careless crowd for the star . The photographers are busy shooting the more spectacular-looking males , like Leon Russell , with his pajama-striped pants and great masses of brindled hair .

You had heard about his strange mannerisms , but you never expected he 'd look like a bad case of muscular dystrophy exacerbated by Parkinson 's disease and St. Vitus ' Dance . There he is , though , Ben Gunn cast away in public , with all the shameful stigmata plastered over him like Superscapegoat . His fingers are fumbling blindly , obscenely , on invisible guitar frets ; his knees are bent , his ankles splayed , his toes curled and pigeoned ; his balance as precarious as a two-year-old toddler 's .

When I got backstage after the show , I found him slumped on a wooden chair in a narrow , coffin-shaped dressing room , the door blocked by a cinema verite camera crew , a sound man crawling around the floor with a periscope mike that popped up between every conversation and Cocker carrying on a low-keyed dialogue with his piano man sidekick , Chris Stainton . " We better get into a recording studio , we 're hot now , " urged Stainton . " Aye , but we 've had the best of it , " mumbled Cocker . I asked him about the future , about films and TV .

" That was the tightlipped warning passed to Mick Jagger on the now-legendary night , November 8 , 1969 , when the Rolling Stones took the stage to bring back the good old days of rock ' n ' roll to America . The place was the Los Angeles Forum , an 18,000-seat , color-coded , deep-freeze tank . The bill was black-heavy with people like B. B. King , the regnant blues belter , and Ike and Tina Turner , the belle and beau of the ball-'n ' - sock- it circuit . Two hours of diathermy by these deep-fat fryers had put the packed house into a sweaty , happy mood , when suddenly the Forum 's zeppelin searchlights switched off and through the murmurous hush of 18,000 craning minds , there sliced the hysterical cry , " THE ROLLING STONES ! ! ! " Wham ! The stage explodes in blue-white incandescence .

Boomeranging the Uncle Sam with one hand while collaring the mike with the other , Jagger screams " Hello ! , " springs into the air and slams down in a split , as the Stones start bashing out " Jumpin ' Jack Flash . " The audience , recoiling in audiovisual shock , not only screeeeeeeecams , but starts climbing the furniture , dancing in the aisles and charging the unguarded stage . Tasting the crowd 's warm , salty blood , Mick the Jagger goes mad , tears off his belt , flogs the stage floor , incites the mob to riot and offers himself as their superhuman sacrifice .

It 's S:30 in the morning the Woodstock hour ? and Jagger is jigging on the ruins of Western Civilization . He 's into his final medley , with a dozen powerful amps screaming , " I Ca n't Get No Satisfaction . " Suddenly , the Stones turn the corner into " Street Fighting Man , " and the whole audience levitates . Every man , woman and love-child mounts his chair , raises his right arm over his head and makes his biggest , blackest , hardest fist ! What a climax ! What a gesture ! What pure Nurem-berg !

No question about it , Der Fuhrer would have been gassed out of his kugel by the scene at the Forum .

Still , young people today do n't know half enough about Hitler . They 've been brainwashed by those shrecky Hollywood movies made during the war years , when one Jewish actor after another took off the Hit as a lunatic and a murderer . ( They say he even took dope ! It was n't dope , just a few pain-killers . ) Young people should only know that Der Fuhrer was a self-proclaimed revolutionary and youth leader . He was the first great tribal shaman and magical minstrel . He was the first to mix the primitive with the futuristic , the first to get it all together , the lights , the sounds , the great clothes and gladiatorial salutes . Why , the guy even wore a maxi coat ! O.K. He was n't much to look at ? though he was a terrific dancer !

The political parallel has been exploited in films like Privilege and Wild in the Streets , sermonized upon by Sunday journalists and , most recently , the Rock-Berlin Axis has been explored by the current generation 's greatest masterpiece , the Who 's  | rock opera , Tommy . When the opera 's deaf , dumb and blind hero , martyr of the older generation and messiah of the younger , throws off the shackles of his afflictions , he instantly becomes a teen tyrant who fetters his disciples with the same manacles of mind and sense once locked on him . True , the kids rebel finally and go hymning off into the rosy revolutionary dawn . But they leave behind them Tommy 's minatory message : " Beware the victims and the martyrs ; they shall become oppressors in their generations .

The ethic of love , love , love , give , give , give , good , good , good is beautiful . When , however , has it justified itself as the rule of life ? Everything we have learned from the masters of the modern mind testifies to the vanity of being better than you are . The current generation seems like an army of Doppelgangers , chanting love and peace as they march to the most militant strains ever blared from the horns of war . To take the Rolling Stones ? in many senses the archetypal rock group ? as instance : what a record they have compiled as impersonators of the Devil ! Granted there is more evil in one tuning peg of Jimi Hendrix 's guitar than in a million copies of Their Satanic Majesties ; still , the fact remains that the . s owe much of their success to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commencing with such callow misdemeanors as " Let 's Spend the Night Together " and escalating through the graver sins of " She Comes in Colors , " " Street Fighting Man " and " Sympathy for the Devil , " the boys have sneered and fleered and ground their heels into the face of middle-class respectability . They have testified , to the tune of millions of dollars , to the great contemporary longing to be bad .  | What has emerged from their triumphal progress ? which includes some notable drug busts and the sorry death of Brian Jones ? is a public image of **52;1652;TOOLONG unprecedented in the annals of pop culture . If the youth public that is so into peace and beatitude were not titillated out of its tepees by this specter of Sodom and gonorrhea , how could they possibly promote the Stones to their present position as the laureates of rock ' n ' riot ? The irony ? perhaps the vindication ? of this strange history is that in pursuing their evil courses the Stones have attained to beauty .

In their naughty middle years , they achieved a not-so-fine art of caricature , becoming the musical equivalents of the cartoonist Crumb , reducing a plethora of pop images to a fistful of jeering grotesques . Commencing with their closest communion with sin , " Sympathy for the Devil , " they suddenly shifted from a head music of ideas about other people 's ideas to a genuine musical life flow . The rolling , roiling , moto perpetuo of " Sympathy " showed that the Stones had a real musical body that answered to the rhythm of Mick Jagger 's body , shaking and soliciting from the stage . Now , in their forthcoming album , Let It Bleed , this movement toward musical and sensuous beauty reaches its culmination in a remarkable track that blazes a new trail for English rock . The beauty part of the new record is not the expanded version of " You Ca n't Always Get What You Want , " featuring a sixty-voice boys ' choir , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? though those are good cuts for everyday consumption . The real Thanksgiving feast is offered on the first band , titled " Girnmie Shelter . " An obsessively lovely specimen of tribal rock , this richly textured chant is rainmaking music . It dissolves the hardness of the Stones and transforms them into spirit voices singing high above the mazey figures on the dancing ground . The music  | takes no course , assumes no shape , reaches no climax ; it simply repeats over an endless drone until it has soaked its way through your soul . Half blue grass and half green gage , " Gimmie Shelter " is music to get stoned by . Taken as a counterpoint to the ranting rave-ups the Stones staged all over America , this cool , impersonal , self-absorbed incantation suggests the schizzy split dividing every contemporary head . It suggests what is actually the fact : that the same kids who are Sieg Heiling one night at some diabolic rally in Pandemonium may be lying the next night in their tents and sleeping bags passing the peace pipe from hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out . The New York Times , 1969  | The Beatles Decide to Let It Be ? Apart THE BEATLES died last week , victims of that dread condition , maturity . Paul McCartney picked up a phone , called John Lennon and said , " I 've decided to leave . " The pop world 's greatest partnership was thereby dissolved . Explanations flew thick and fast . Some writers blamed Yoko Ono , John 's wife , some Linda Eastman , Paul 's bride . Allen Klein , the Beatles ' current manager , came in for his share . But the real villain was time , the decade that had transformed the Beatles from four identical boys to four different and disagreeing men . The signs of creeping maturity have long been apparent . The Beatles ' music aches now with nostalgia for the good old days of rock ' n ' roll . Their response to revolution is the gentle philosophy of " Let It Be . " When asked why he quit , Paul said , " I have a better time with my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow up . Their myth was wedded to youth . Yet they never stopped developing from the first day they got together as a schoolboy skiflie band in Liverpool to the last night they recorded  | in EMI 's electronic jungle on Abbey Road . For years every album marked a new level of attainment and thrust them into wider contact with the whole world of contemporary culture . Like those fabulous musicians of ancient legend ? like Amphion who raised the walls of Thebes with the sounds of his lyre ? the Beatles reared with their electric guitars the inflatable , pulsile , Day-Glo walls of the Rock Age . They generated with their poetry , music and wit a whole new milieu of discotheques and light shows ; of long hair , mod fashions and hippie costumes ; of groupies , dopers and teenyboppers . Standing above their world like the zany sorcerers in the Magical Mystery Tour , they controlled its emotional climate , season by season , for the better part of a decade . By 1967 , moreover , whether by accident or design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time were working right down there on the basic level of **71;1706;TOOLONG ! Their immense success never turned the Beatles ' heads , but it made them swell dangerously . After the death of their manager Brian Epstein , the boys began to act as if they could do everything as easily and triumphantly as they wrote and recorded songs . They botched a movie , made a disillusioning pilgrimage to India , and then committed their most grievous error by founding Apple Corps Ltd. , their pop culture cartel . A naive attempt to reconcile the rival claims of artistic idealism with a natural desire to make more money , the Apple was in trouble from the day it started . It was managed by Paul while John went through his marital crisis , George practiced his sitar and Ringo puttered around his Tudor mansion like a plumber called to fix a leak . Apple accomplished few of its purposes and lost huge sums . With the millions rolling in and rolling out again like bilge on a sinking ship , John persuaded Paul to hand the checkbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man Paul found offensive .  | Chagrined , Paul retreated to a farm in Scotland , where he watched Klein prune the Apple , John pose nude with Yoko , Ringo and George take star turns in films and records . The rumors about Paul 's death had symbolic truth . He was dead as a Beatle . As a man , as an artist , he was very much alive , preparing his declaration of independence : an album entitled McCartney , which is too per cent Paul . Writing , singing and playing all the songs , his wife Linda snapping the cover pictures , Paul topped off the package with a printed interview that spelled out death to the Beatles . The cruelest cut came with a question obviously designed to schmaltz over the rift . Asking Paul , " Was there a moment when you thought , Wish Ringo were here for this break ? ' " the interviewer received a curt , cold answer : " No . " Even for a dry-eyed observer , it is hard to imagine the boys going it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role and each role locked into the others . If Paul was pretty , John was tough . If John was way out , Ringo was down to earth . If Ringo was cute , George was almost somber . Round and round they went , like movements of a Swiss watch . But take the watch to pieces and what is left ? Not much , which is reason for sadness . Still , regrets seem out of place when you consider what these boys accomplished . Nobody who grew up with them will ever get over the Beatles . Life , 1970  | " Grab the Money and Run " DISAFFECTION WITH " counter-culture " ? the mishmash of myths , music and mishigas animating our youth ? is beginning to manifest itself in the writings of the most observant and thoughtful of the younger rock critics . While the mass media go right on endorsing every fad and foible of a decadent pop culture , while " soul " is co-opted by Coca-Cola and " revolution " becomes a phrase in a pants commercial , the kids who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register their disgust with its perversions and their despair of its ever attaining its ostentatiously proclamed millennium . Recently , virtually an entire issue of Rolling Stone , the rock world 's most authoritative journal , was devoted to an exhaustive inquest into the Rolling Stones ' farewell concert at Altamont , California . The free concert ? ballyhooed by Mick Jagger as " a Christmas and Hanukkah rite to American Youth " ? resulted in the murder of an armed black spectator by a gang of knife-wielding Hell 's Angels ( hired for $900 in beer to protect the vulnerable Mick ) , three accidental deaths from various causes and enough bad vibrations to  | shake the rock establishment to its foundations . As one participant lamented , " There was no love , no joy . It was n't just the Angels . It was everybody . In twenty-four hours we created all the problems of our society in one place : congestion , violence , dehumanization . " Hardly noticed on the East Coast , Altamont grossed out the West . The Los Angeles Free Press expressed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair and an Adolf Hitler mustache , his arm flung fraternally around a ghoulish Angel , while a crowd of long-haired kids hailed the pair with the Nazi salute . Rolling Stone , with a thoroughness rare in these days of capsule news dispatches , searched out the disastrous event in every direction . The picture that emerged of the rock establishment with its rapacious greed , its shifty , manipulative tactics , its utter unconcern for people 's lives and decencies and its incredible megalomania was worthy of a muckraking masterpiece on the Robber Barons . The new Robber Bands , make no mistake , come from England bent on crass exploitation . Anyone who has traveled with these musicians or simply sat for an afternoon in their dressing rooms can testify to the contemptuous and paranoid view they hold of this country . " Grab the money and run " is their basic philosophy . Whether , like Blind Faith , they shark together in a so-called supergroup , make a fast million in a single tour and then disband ; or whether , like the Stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give something back to the people with a free concert ( which is in fact a film-making project to coin even more money ) ; or whether , like the Beatles , they take the attitude that only through making vast sums of ( American ) money will they be able to save the world , the freebooting of these rock bandits ought to end forever the idea that the counter-culture is founded on some genuine ethical ideal , or that it marks in any significant way a break with the prevailing capitalistic system . The other side of the discontent with counter-culture ,  | represented by Salingerian pathos over broken dreams and busted ideals , was beautifully expressed by Ellen Willis , twenty-seven-year-old rock critic of The New Yorker , writing recently in The New York Review of Books . In a long , elegiac reflection , Miss Willis examined the myths and beliefs of the counter-culture through the lenses of two current films , Easy Rider and Alice 's Restaurant . Her conclusion is that " at this point , hate and love seem to be merging into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything is disintegrating , including the counter-culture itself , and that we really have nowhere to go . " Underscoring the sense of lost opportunities that haunts the current moment , Miss Willis finds the dominant mood crystallized in the phrases : " What went wrong ? We blew it ! " " It . " Though Miss Willis forbears to mention such things , " it " includes art , as exemplified by albums like the Beatles ' Sgt. Pepper ; ecstasy , as induced by mind-stunning discotheques like L'Oursin and the original Electric Circus ; euphoria , as produced by the dozen or more Afro-oriented dances that sprang up with soul music and now have died ? along with all dancing in the white world . Communitas perished as an urban ideal with the decay of Haight-Ashbury . Meditation suffered a setback when the cult of the Maharishi was exploded . Ritual was abandoned along with the early hippie mystique . Spirit voyaging declined after the first great excitement over psychedelics died down . Revolution has a pretty pathetic ring to it today ; guerrilla warfare was always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , the Silent Majority , which holds the power to elect a government headed by Richard Nixon . In sum , what the kids blew was a millennial moment ? one of those rare opportunities when a crack appears in the mundane shell . The question " What went wrong ? " takes us back to the fall , the fall of ' 67 , when the exodus began from the Hashbury after a summer of paradisiacal joy . Then , if ever , the Woodstock Nation should have prevailed . Instead , what prevailed was apathy and drugs , petty crime , hustling , has-  | sling , disease and madness . By the time of the pretended " Death of the Hippie " in San Francisco , and the very real deaths of Linda and Groovy in New York , the whole ideal of counter-culture was on the ropes and sagging . Seen in this perspective , Woodstock was merely a three-day revival meeting . What clinches the argument for the decline and fall of counter-culture is the fate of rock music , which was the catalyst that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided it through its short but kinky history . The fall of rock occurred at the same time as the fall of the hippie . It was in the winter of ' 67 ? ' 68 that the Beatles ( read John Lennon ) decided to do an about-face and retreat ( with hip finesse ) to their earlier manner , or even further to the music of the old masters who preceded them , like Buddy Holly , Chuck Berry , Little Richard and Elvis Presley . Rocking from the failure of their tedious home movie , The Magical Mystery Tour , growing alarmed at the bad box office signaled by mounting prestige among intellectuals and declining popularity among teenyboppers , the Beatles decided to abandon the rich vein that had produced Sgt. Pepper and those fascinating compositions , " Strawberry Fields " and " I Am the Walrus . " This act of creative apostasy announced the beginning of Rock Revival , the great roll back to 1957 and the joys of being once again a simpleminded teenager . Electing to scrape the old bubble-gum off the wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of followers became the first generation in history to decline the great adventure of their destiny in favor of a premature return to childhood and the cloying pleasures of nostalgia . Today , as a result of the determination of the past two years , rock culture stands at the opposite pole from where it stood in its peak period . At its peak , the input of raw creative energy was so overwhelming that the elaborate system of filters , buffers and diluters that normally stands between the public and the creative mind momentarily broke down and the masses were mainlining pure , uncut musical heroin .  | Rusty old Tin Pan Alley seemed to have sunk into the hole left by the rising Atlantis . But as the ideals and myths that had sustained rock began to crumble , into the gap rushed the banished swarm of parasite producers and wheeler-dealers . In no time rock was computerized into the stalking zombie it is today , lurching along without a thought , a purpose or a plan beyond that offered by the record rating charts and the airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly exhausted cliches that pours twenty-four hours a day from the radio like Muzak without strings . What is even more dismaying than this industrialization of the art is the acceptance of the bubblegum mentality by even the finest rock musicians . The latest albums of rock geniuses ( the Beatles , Bob Dylan ) show an unhappy drift toward the purely commercial aspect of their music . Too much complacency , too many ego trips , too great a facility with the tucks and pleats of current fashion has led them toward a subtly specious music that is attractive but not compelling , enchanting but not convincing . As for the dozens of groups and performers who are not so gifted , they present the collective image of a monotonously revolving kaleidoscope , loaded with bits of hand-cut , tie-dyed , plastic gospel , blues , rock , jazz , pop , folk , pop , blues , and so on in endlessly shifting combinations of this week 's , last month 's , tomorrow 's " sound . " No Tin Pan Alley Svengali could have molded anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavens recently in a Time cover story . Endearing , amusing , bouncy and bathetic by turns , packaged in homespun and hominy , peddled with homilies about integrity and respect for old folks , the Band , or the Bland , is a promo man 's dream . They do n't have to be edited , cooled , controlled or explained ; they run no risks of offending anyone ; they fit in perfectly with the worship of mediocrity that is beginning to take the place of the old devil cults . With their twangy , rubbery , pogo-stick beat ? produced , mind you , with an au-  | thentic folk instrument called the electric wah-wah pedal ? the Band is ideal for the adult bubble-gum market . It is beginning to look as though J. Edgar Hoover , Spiro T. Agnew , Mayor Daley , Judge Hoffman and Ronald Reagan , the deans of our great universities and the police and sanitation departments of our cities no longer have any cause to fear an uprising from the red Maoist masses of American youth . The generation that three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionize our culture has now begun to drift aimlessly along the lines of least resistance . We need no longer fear all the lurid predictions of the pop press . The real fear should be that a generation which rejects its inherited culture with such facility will inevitably reject or betray its own youth culture with the same jettisoning zeal . Counter-culture is largely anti-culture ; one step more and it becomes non-culture . The New York Times , 197o  | Drugs and Death in the Rundown World of Rock Music F IRST , it was Jimi Hendrix , rock 's flamboyant superstar , snuffed out at twenty-seven , dead on arrival at a London hospital . The cause ? Suffocation from vomiting while unconscious from sleeping pills . Accidental overdose ? Suicide ? The coroner could not say . Then it was Janis Joplin , rock 's greatest soul belter , also twenty-seven , found dead on the floor of a Los Angeles motel room , fresh needle marks on her left arm , a red balloon filled with a white powder stashed in her trash can . Coroner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man and woman of such energy and talent , endorsed with immense success , showered with love , raised to the glory of demi-gods , imperil their lives with dope ? If you were drawn even for a moment into Jimi Hendrix 's breathless quest for life , his urgent headlong pursuit not simply of pleasure but of the most elusive and exotic states of mind and soul , you would know that his death was an inevitable product of his life and of a society that on one hand idealistically proclaims every virtue from Sophocles  | and Jesus to Sigmund Freud , and on the other hand pushes Dow Chemicals , pushes Parke Davis , pushes Lockheed , pushes , pushes , pushes . . . Hendrix once sent someone a bag of cocaine with a. high-flown note inscribed in flowery script : " Within I grace thee with wings . 0 lovely and true Birds of Heavenly Snow and Crystals , Fly my love as you have before . Pleasures are only steps and this . . . just one more . " That was the rhetoric of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made his mere existence a daily miracle . It sent him flickering among the candles and bottles and fuming incense of his nocturnal day , it moved him to sniff cocaine and drop acid and drink wine all in a row , like the chord changes in a tune on which he was improvising . Janis Joplin was possessed by a very different demon . She doted on the image of the hard-drinking , hard-living , hard-loving soul mama . She gloried in self-destruction , tearing out her throat with every song , brandishing a bottle of Southern Comfort on the stage , turning rock-solid blues like " Ball and Chain " into screaming , wailing sado-masochistic nightmares . " Sure I could take better care of my health , " she once said . " It might add a few years ? but what the hell ! " Janis said she never touched drugs . But how could she avoid them ? Dope was as essential to her myth as blues , booze and the frantic beat with which she tore out her heart . Whether she needed dope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crucial to her act . The reckless lives of both Jimi Hendrix , a poor black who became a superstar overnight , and Janis Joplin , a middle-class Southern white infatuated with a fantasy of black soul , are not unique within the context of our myths of art , show business , the jazz genius , the existential hero . Hendrix and Joplin had the additional pressure , as the king and queen of rock , of ruling over a crumbling kingdom . Since the peak year of 1967 , when they flashed on the scene , rock has run down badly . This year of 1970 has seen the most lavish outlays ever made in the history of the pop re-  | cording business ; yet hardly a star has come up with anything that could match his previous records . The rock festival has degenerated into a grotesque tragicomedy peopled by swindling promoters , gate-crashing kids , club-wielding cops and money-mad stars . The world that once adored those innocent boys , the Beatles , which decked itself with flowers , practiced transcendental meditation , came together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently of love and peace ? that beguiling world now lies broken . The rock culture has become the drug culture . Convinced that everything is fraud , feasting on films that feed their paranoia , feeling helpless and betrayed , huddled together , thousands of ordinary kids are a set-up for the pusher ? and the " magic " drugs that promise ecstasy , stifle fear , shut out insistent demands , that provide an urgent sense of purpose in lives devoid of goals . Yet what they are addicted to ultimately is not drugs but dreams ? the myths and fantasies which they have imbibed from the mass media . What is really frightening is that so many of these kids seem indifferent to life . Where they once enhanced their looks and asserted their careless vitality through gay psychedelic plumage , they now shuffle around in drab , raggedy , dead men 's clothes . Instead of exulting in the physical joys of dancing , the sensuous pleasures of love , the whole sensorium of rock music , most of the kids I see in the college classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the East Village seem depressed and apathetic , reckless about dropping , popping or smoking anything that promises a momentary high . It is within the context of this New Depression that the deaths of the rock stars must be pondered . When I talked recently to friends of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin , they painted almost identical pictures of the two stars during their last days . Both appeared to be groping for a new phase . Already past the frenzy of sudden fame , wise to the makebelieve in their own legends , aware that both they and rock  | had lost the spark , both performers were trying to prepare new songs with new bands to reaffirm their status as superstars . It seems likely that the transition proved too much for them . After a brief high ride on the hot blast of the great years , the sudden chill of change , of reality , must have been deadly .

Explorations , 1967  | The popularity of Jewish humor in America today can , however , be only partially gauged standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should also take a look at the subway posters where Chinese and Negro faces masticate slices of rye bread above the line , " You do n't have to be Jewish to love Levy 's " ; or catch a TV commercial in which a barber is affectionately called bubbee or a husband denounced as " stark raving meshuga . " Yiddish , once a dying language , has been revived a word at a time by Madison Avenue and Broadway until it is now the lingua franca of American humor . In one sense it is not surprising that American humor has adopted a Jewish tone . Particularly in the show business world , Jews have dominated the comedy scene for fifty years ; in fact , there is no other area of American cultural life in which they have been so dominant . Among the more famous , we have Charlie Chaplin , Ben Blue , the Marx Brothers , Eddie Cantor , Danny Kaye and Jerry Lewis in films ; Jack Benny , Ed Wynn , Milton Berle , Sid Caesar and Phil Silvers on radio and TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joe E. Lewis , Henny Youngman , Mort Sahl , Lenny Bruce and many others in nightclubs . Then there are wellknown cartoonists , Saul Steinberg , Rube Goldberg , Al Capp and Jules Feiffer ; comedy writers , S. J. Perelman , A. J. Liebling , Milt Gross and Bud Schulman ; and gag writers Goodman Ace , Mel Brooks and Mel Tolkin . From this list of names , which could be extended indefinitely , it is obvious that the Jew has long provided most of the comic talent in the entertainment business . The big difference today is that now the Jew also provides the comic material . Jewish culture ? its manners , folkways , values , its language and style of delivery , physical and verbal ? serves as the frame of reference for much contemporary American humor . The sort of material that could once have been used only before Jewish audiences in the Catskill 's " Borscht Belt , " on the Lower East Side , at a fund-raising dinner for the U. J. A. or among such in-groups as the Lambs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unintelligible to Gentiles and possibly provocative of anti-Semitic responses has now become common property . It was in the mid-Fifties that the style of American humor began to undergo this radical transformation . At that time , as part of the license of " sick " humor , the Jewish comedian first dared to be explicitly Jewish before a Gentile audience . Unlike the traditional Jewish comic ? Jack Benny , for example , who never allowed the audience to glimpse his Jewish identity and who even used as his foil a grotesque stereotype called Schlepperman ? the new " sick " comics , headed by Lenny Bruce and numbering such gifted performers as Nichols and May , Shelley Berman and Mel Brooks , made their Jewish identity paramount . At the very same time , young writers like Philip Roth , whose Goodbye , Columbus was published in 1959 , began likewise to broach the problems of Jewishness in a ruthlessly frank manner . From nightclubs to novels , it was all essentially the same : a new generation of American Jews had found a voice for their anger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Jewish writers and performers to " expose " themselves was , of course , merely an intensification of feelings shared by tens of thousands of young American Jews . Security made the difference ? security built up through several generations who , no longer persecuted , were progressing triumphantly toward their goals of social and cultural achievement . Furthermore , this generation had received a vital spiritual reinforcement in the establishment of the state of Israel , an influence that is hard to measure but which registered profoundly within the American Jewish community . Perhaps the generally permissive atmosphere of the postwar period should also be taken into account ; in any case , the traditionally conformist tendencies of American Jewry changed . The old feeling of shame was transformed into one of pride and , in some cases , of arrogance . The American Jew , once a nachschlepper , now marched in the van , an acknowledged leader of contemporary culture . Be-  | cause of his obvious achievements and the special tolerance he now enjoys , the Jew is more than ever free to exercise the license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as important as the Jew 's willingness to talk , however , is the Gentile 's willingness to listen . Perhaps " willingness " and " listen " are not the right words , because they suggest simply an attitude of passive tolerance . In fact the popularity of Jewish humor rests on a more positive basis , particularly on a need to discover some adequate metaphor for a whole complex of contemporary ideas , feelings and stigmas ? a need met by the concept of Jewishness . Lenny Bruce defined this symbolic signficance of Jewishness in characteristically concrete terms : To me , if you live in New York or any other big city , you are Jewish . It does n't matter even if you 're Catholic ; if you live in New York you 're Jewish . If you live in Butte , Montana , you 're going to be goyish even if you 're Jewish . Evaporated milk is goyish even if the Jews invented it . Spam is goyish and rye bread is Jewish . Negroes are all Jews . Italians are all Jews . Irishmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not only equating Jewishness with urban sophistication , knowledgeability , and " hipness " ; he is also connecting it with the problem of identity faced by any alienated group . It is clear that the style and content of Jewish humor strikes a deeply responsive chord in the younger generation of highly aware , alert and urbanized Americans who are enthusiastically embracing it . Jewishness represents their psychological plight , too . For the Jew the plight centers around the challenge of alienation and assimilation , the humor itself spun from the tension of a very real conflict : his Jewish versus his American identity . For the non-Jew the conflict is more diffused , but powerful nonetheless : his personal versus his mass-cultural identity . Every American today is caught between the nostalgic yearning for a safe , comfortable , well-defined personal past ( childhood , family ,  | religion ) , and the difficult challenge of adapting to an increasingly ( and frighteningly ) depersonalized society . As James Joyce divined when he made the hero of Ulysses Leopold Bloom , the Jew with his " hang-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alienated stance is a twentieth-century symbol for Everyman . Modern American Jewish humor has a special ironic , ambivalent ? both contemptuous and nostalgic ? tone which is intimately associated with the confusing dilemma of assimilation . This special tone was first heard in Central Europe , in the places where the Jew was first " emancipated . " It colored the Berlin cabaret performances of the Twenties , the theatrical collaborations of Brecht and Weill , and the gibes of Bemelmans , Perelman and others condemned by Goebbels in 1938 as a " Jewish infected minority " and denounced for " jokes that cease to be jokes when they touch the holiest matters of national life . " In the search for the source of this modern humor , one can go even further back : to the first great writer of the Jewish " Emancipation . " The prototype of the ambivalent Jew using a comedy lens for self-scrutiny is Heinrich Heine . Heine was reared in Dusseldorf , whose population was predominantly Catholic , by parents who were observant but far from orthodox . As a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptized . After a thorough preparatory education he worked in the family business run by his wealthy uncle , a banker . This experience intensified Heine 's sense of inferiority as well as his disdain for the business Jew . In general he was emotionally drawn to Jews , but intellectually repelled by orthodox Judaism ; his attitude was a mixture of admiration and antagonism . From a young age Heine was uncomfortably aware of himself as an outsider , as a Jew among Christians . His early poetry , for which he was called " the German Byron , " described the melancholy pain of unfulfilled love : it was a poetry of rejection . He tends , however , to mock his own emotions , to gaze like a cynical observer at his own pain .  | Because of this inclination , Heine has been aptly described as " the poet of divided and self-alienated consciousness par excellence . " Of himself , he once stated significantly , " I can not relate my own griefs without the thing becoming comic . " In his later years Heine wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returned to verse in a different tone , incorporating his many unresolved conflicts in a remarkable mixture of styles , tones and varied emotions , combining " folk-lore naivete , worldly cynicism , grotesque fantasy , poignant lyricism and earthy humor . " The Jewish element in Heine 's wit rests on his sense of caricature , his fusion of sentiment with irony and above all his penchant for self-satire . Along with his love of life , he communicates a profound feeling of alienation from the world ? a feeling shared by all assimilated or partly assimilated Jews whose position in society is inevitably ambiguous . Despite the gap of over a hundred and fifty years , Heinrich Heine 's use of the comedy lens is relevant to the American Jew today . The long history of Jewish humor encompasses hundreds of years , countless countries , and numerous specific traditions . Its power in contemporary America , however , rests neither on the fact that humor is a form of solace for the downtrodden nor on the notion that it is used as a safe discharge of rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable than in any other country at any time , he nevertheless ? like Heine ? resists total assimilation just as firmly as he resists orthodox Judaism . His conflict is one of alienation and identity ; and his attempt to conform produces discomfort and confusion . He is neither a proud alien ( which the Gentiles would like ) , nor a devout Jew ( which the Jews would like ) , nor , certainly , truly indistinguishable from the others ( which he himself would like ) . Since he can not totally surrender his identity , he views life from an isolated position ? his head cocked ironically awry , his eyes and mind always alert to control his environment by total intellectual awareness and his tongue poised to mock both himself and others , Jews and  | Gentiles alike . For the Jew a highly developed verbal wit serves as both shield and salvation . The power , richness and complexity of Jewish humor in America builds on three distinct levels , each of which generates disillusionment , anger and conflict . The three levels are family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child versus his parents ; lower middle-class Jewish society versus upper middle-class Gentile society ; and the glamorized images of the mass media versus the harsh everyday realities , i.e. , fantasy versus reality . The family relationship is particularly crucial because it establishes the basic psychodynamics of Jewish humor . The Jewish comic never completely severs his childhood connections with ? and antagonisms toward ? his family , particularly his mother . Even when grown , he remains a boy-man . Within the Jewish family alienation between generations is often strikingly accelerated because the parents are highly ambitious for their children . In America first-generation Jews typically reared children who made money and were professionally successful , but who did not basically abandon the cultural values of their immigrant parents . Children reared by this highly successful second generation were quite different . Very sensitive to style , taste and appearance , they were embarrassed by and contemptuous of their parents ' " vulgar " goals ; in turn , they reacted violently to demands for success and family loyalty . This third generation ? which has produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolonged adolescence , rebellious intermarriage and an inability to formulate life goals . Their extreme alienation stems from several factors common to Jewish family life : ( r ) the breakdown of firm order and strong values , resulting in extreme permissiveness ; ( 2 ) the pattern of the parents ' secret ulterior manipulation of children ? demonstrative love veiling strong demands ? which causes such confused resentment within the child that he often totally rejects his family ; ( 3 ) the pressure for success " no matter what you do , " exerted by parents whose permis-  | siveness has robbed their children of the habits of discipline , concentration and endurance required for achievement ; and ( q. ) perhaps most important , the Jewish mother 's destructive domination , her demands for love and success from her son , which are linked to her refusal to grant him the independence required for manhood . Philip Roth depicts the antagonism between Jewish generations in a subtle but deadly style , particularly in Letting Go , where Jewish types are " put on " to the hilt ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domineering , selfpitying , fatuous and affected . And yet with Roth , as often also with the less refined writers , there is an attitude of tenderness coexisting with one of rage . Similarly , Bruce Jay Friedman in A Mother 's Kisses presents a biting ? and yet warm ? portrait of the struggle between a son and his mother . He has captured both the flamboyant , commanding mother with her embarrassing pushiness and lack of selfrestraint , and the inhibited , troubled adolescent dragged through life on mama 's apron strings . Although the mother is really amusing and well-meaning , her refusal to allow her son any independence is , for him , galling and pitifully unmanning . The boy is very attached to and yet very angry at his mother ; he can not , however , express his anger toward someone who is so " good " to him . His only outlet is farcical ambivalence ? a love that pursues through mockery and an anger that disguises itself as humor . Friedman 's vision is both comic and disquieting . From these third-generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roth and Friedman illuminate comes the boy-man , the Jewish comic ( writer , performer , cartoonist , etc. ) , who is in turn the major force in modern American humor . ( Typically , he has a juvenilesounding name : " Woody " Allen , " Jerry " Lewis , " Soupy " Sales , " Lenny " Bruce , " Sandy " Baron , etc . ) This Jewish comic is the adolescent urban funny boy ? hysterically intense . The key to his comedy ? and the ironic clue to his tragedy ? is that he is intellectually and verbally overdevel-  | oped at the same time that he is emotionally and sexually underdeveloped . Although on one level he is sharp and sophisticated , on another level he is merely childish and petulant . This Jewish comic , the boy-man , often comes from Brooklyn or the Bronx , the urban perimeter of New York . He lives in the street , on corners , in candy stores and " luncheonettes " and at the movies . He is nervous , restless and loud ? always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Jewish hipster is intensely personal . For seven years I lived ? like the characters in A Mother 's Kisses ? in " three rooms in Bensonhurst . " I learned that Bensonhurst and similar neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx have produced as many Jewish comedians as Vienna Jewish analysts or Odessa Jewish fiddlers . My introduction to this frenetic comic world grew out of a casual meeting with one of my students at Brooklyn College ? and a conversation about jazz . Eventually this student introduced me to his circle of friends , young people in their midtwenties who had always lived in the lower-middle-class neighborhoods of Brooklyn . They were an odd lot : some were in a shady home-repair business ; some in television ; some went to school ; and some did nothing . Having known each other and shared their lives since adolescence , they enjoyed above all getting together and talking ? in a " show biz , " not a conversational , way . They had developed an indigenous humor , wild and fantastic , collectively inspired but individually performed . Gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room every Saturday night , with everyone having his turn onstage . The atmosphere was that of a jam session . The group 's excitement released each performer , sending his fancies flying sky-high . The form for the evening was simple : generally a review of the week 's events which would cue the performer into past experiences , social observations and then any and every sort of material ? all produced purely spontaneously . This impromptu volleying of funny fantasies was called the Spritz . I remember the excitement , the abandon of this scene ,  | what it felt like to be caught up in this frenzy ? and especially what it felt like to generate and to control it . It gave you a tremendous sense of power to see people in front of you doubled over with the pain of laughter . Then you would work twice as hard to drive them over the edge into total hysteria . Sadistic ? Absolutely . And the " bits " were wild and obscene . Sex experiences topped the list ; they were treated with all possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What if " bits were also popular , spun off with the stabbing force of black humor . " What if the pilots in the big airlines were really juiced out of their skulls and had to ditch their plane and passengers ? " " What if the junkies were to take over the U.N. ? " This kind of fantasy was not merely satirical , not merely incongruous in the usual manner of humor . It was desecratory . In doing such bits myself I found that at some moments you flew out of yourself , becoming purely a channel for inspiration ; there was an almost total loss of self-consciousness and of awareness of the present moment . In the personal narrative of past experience you used yourself ruthlessly , exulting in the exposure of the weaknesses and deficiencies of an earlier self . Using the former self as the butt of the present self meant indulging in an orgy of triumphant self-hatred , an exorcism of the loathed self-image . One thing that emerged clearly from the spontaneous comic brilliance of these ritual staging sessions was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was just enough Jewish identity left in these young people 's fairly well-assimilated families to make an issue of it ? an issue which stirred them deeply ; in a word , they felt contaminated by their parents . Their satire was born in the rejection of their immediately surrounding world , in the desecration of first the family , then the neighborhood and finally the whole milieu in which they had grown up . Instead of swallowing or disguising their emotions , these young Jews ? consumed with self-hate or shame ? came out in the open and blasted the things that hurt them . Basic to the mentality of these Brooklyn comics was this :  | they had polarized to a grotesque degree the values of intelligence , good breeding and culture on the one hand ; and their own condition as crude , wild , Jewish outcasts and pariahs on the other . Even in later life their tenacity in holding to these opposing images was absolutely incredible . No amount of experience , persuasion or love could efface these convictions ; they were primary images imprinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much by a fondness for them as by an incapacity to shed them . For if they were vulgar and uneducated , yet they were also " smaht . " If they lacked culture , yet they had fun . The balance psychically was such that they were as much in love with their imperfections as they were enraged by them . What they needed , and found , was a medium in which to register this confused and complex self-awareness . That this medium was comedy followed from the fact that they could not express their feelings with perfect seriousness . Like the hypochondriac who fears he is dying of a fatal disease , they knew in one part of their minds that they were not so badly off as they liked to imagine ; that , in fact , their sense of inferiority was an exaggerated conceit . Comedy , therefore , provided the license and the medium for the extreme exaggeration of reality that corresponded with the intensity of their feelings . These Brooklyn bright boys that I knew were a particular group , but they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish comic , the boy-man , who is exerting such a powerful influence on American humor today . And this humor can not be understood without digging to its core , to its family roots : to the pain , the humiliation , the anger and the alienation imprinted early on the boy who eventually finds release in comic raving , ranting and raging . He grows up to be not a man , but a boyman , because ? no matter how bright , verbal or intellectually attuned ? he is in part still a child " acting out " to gain attention , a child having a tantrum to punish his parents , a child cursing the forces of darkness which terrify and torture him . Having derived its first surge of anger and conflict from  | the family , Jewish humor builds next on the social setting : the problems of assimilation ? of survival ? for the Jew in a Gentile world . The American Jew , whose roots are basically lower-middle-class , is forced to adapt himself to a society whose values are set by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should still be preoccupied with the Jew-Gentile confrontation and conflict , should still fear the goyim , even when he is apparently secure and well integrated ; however , it may really be a sign of the Jew 's growing confidence that he exposes his sense of alienation so openly rather than hiding his anxious fantasies within . Recognizing himself as an outsider , an alien among Gentiles , the Jew regards his position with characteristic ambivalence : both pride and contempt . Traditionally the Jews think of themselves as clever and knowing , scorning the goyim as dumb and slow-witted . In complete contrast , however , the Jews also traditionally identify weakness , suffering and disaster with themselves ; in turn , they attribute health , physical strength and normality to the Gentiles . In order to deal with this confusing mixture of pride and contempt , the Jew has classically adopted the figure of the schlemiel as a symbol of his predicament . Using the theme of the schlemiel is standard not only for the nightclub comic 's routine ( beginning with his ridiculing himself ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Wallace Markfield , Bruce Jay Friedman and even the more serious Saul Bellow . The classic schlemiel is the " I " dramatized as inept , inadequate , foolish , exploited or selfdeceiving in a situation that elicits the audience 's sympathy or tears . Today 's entertainers , however , have transformed the basic pattern ; they have so distorted the schlemiel 's dilemma by comic imagination that he becomes terribly funny rather than sad . The psychological dynamics underlying the pose of the schlemiel help explain its duration and popularity : it is safer to attack ourselves or to laugh at ourselves before others do , because in this way we gain the offensive . By controlling the re-enactment of our inadequacy imagina-  | tively and cleverly , we also have the psychological satisfaction of enlisting sympathetic laughter . As Freud has shown , people side with us when they laugh at something with us ; and this solidarity exists even when we encourage them to laugh with us at us . The schlemiel 's power rests on his daring to lay bare his own weakness and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or absurd , the schlemiel conceals behind his mask a hidden strength : a shrewd sense of self-preservation . Bruce Jay Friedman 's Stern is the most vividly drawn , the most completely unmasked schlemiel created by any modern American writer . The novel which bears his name presents an exhausting and penetrating image of the Jewish fantasies underlying most modern humor . Stern , in his early thirties , is " a tall , round-shouldered man with pale , spreading hips " who lives with his wife and child in a Gentile community . His story is an emotional odyssey initiated by a small but dreadful incident . Coming home from work one day , Stern is shocked to hear from his wife that when their child had tried to play with the other children , a neighbor ? a man ? had pushed her down , snatched up his own child and bellowed : " No playing here for kikes . " Equally horrifying , his wife reports that because she was not wearing underpants she had exposed herself to the man when she fell . Interpreting this event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confirmation of one of his worst fears , building on it obsessively until he is driven almost insane . He is , and has always been , the perfect victim ? unable to talk with his neighbors , afraid of everyone , fearful even of calling the police . He is not only ashamed of things that are not his fault ( like his ravaged garden eaten by caterpillars ) , but he is also prey to dreadful anxieties and is forever imagining disaster . Paralyzed by baffled anger which he can not express , he is plagued by paranoid fantasies : that the cold wind will freeze his penis , snapping it off ; that his wife will be unfaithful to him at every opportunity ; that his child will fall ill and die .  | Stern 's insecurities relate to his early childhood , to his being continually exploited by his mother and to his even witnessing her infidelities . His Jewish education was a farce , superficial and meaningless ; for him being a Jew comes to mean nothing more than being required to suffer . Fixated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions , Stern retreats into illness , is sent to a rest home , and ? not surprisingly for a victim ? receives little comfort from his family . Among the very ill he feels some relief , only to become once again excessively anxious when he returns to reality . Eventually he exacts some small satisfaction from the man who insulted his wife . Nothing , however , has really changed . Fear is basic to his being and will always haunt him . Stern is pure black humor which , if presented seriously , would be an unbearable nightmare ; instead , it is all played on a note of absurdity and intense hilarity , the fears made funny and thus tolerable . Stern 's playing the schlemiel to the ultimate degree diminishes him to quivering helplessness and yet at the same time saves him ? by allowing him to escape into sickness . Reduced to the complete and captive victim in a rest home , he finds strength ? not enough to triumph , surely , but enough to survive . Although Stern pays a horrifyingly high price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means to withdraw from painful realities . It is in truth his fantasy life from which he can not protect himself ; in real life , however , being the schlemiel serves as a refuge and as a rationalization for him . Similarly , it is significant that Stern continually uses his Jewishness as a rationale for his inferiority and inadequacy . It is probably true that some of his deepest fears and weaknesses originated in the Jewish family and its conflicts , his particular family ; and that he has been cursed from childhood with obsessions and terrors that inevitably trail him through the years . Stern himself , however , blames Jewishness in a different sense , a social sense . He sees himself persecuted on a larger scale ? by people around him , not by his  | past . For many years he has divided reality into two parts , seeing everything virile , attractive and acceptable as Gentile ; everything ugly , cowardly and eccentric as Jewish . By acting on this conviction and moving to the Gentile hinterlands ? the neighborhood he chose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time that he readied his excuse : terrible things happened to him simply because he was Jewish . Basically Stern is grateful to have such an excuse as an available and expandable container for his frightening anxieties . Here , one explanation for the immense popularity of Jewish humor in America should be underscored : the seductive appeal of the schlemiel pose ? in many variations ? as an excuse , an apology and a rationalization . To be a schlemiel is to have a stronghold for retreat . Stern 's convenient use of his Jewish identity to justify his feeling of being an outsider , a victim , a man who does n't belong ? and his total inability to direct his anger at those who really provoke or exploit him ? help explain the wide appeal of Jewish humor . Perhaps more than in any other way the Jew as schlemiel is the symbol of Everyman in America 1967 , a symbol which stimulates not only sympathy but also empathy . Today there are countless Americans of Stern 's generation who suffer from similar feelings of inadequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions and similar convictions of inferiority and alienation . The two cornerstones of Jewish humor ? family and social ? are united finally by a third building block : the cultural . Of the many factors responsible for creating the problems of this generation we have been discussing , the one most relevant to comedy has been the incalculably persuasive influence of the mass media on emotional development . Growing up in the Thirties and Forties , the American child was fed on late-afternoon radio serials ( usually stressing virility ) , in the evening he sprawled on the floor to read comics , and on Saturdays he sat in the charged darkness of the movies , entranced by seductive images and situations .  | This generation , the first to have been so totally conditioned to desire and to expect a world of make-believe , was frozen into a state of imaginative and emotional retardation . Since reality could not possibly rival the glamorous illusions so deeply implanted by films , radio and newspapers , they found in comparison that their lives seemed excruciatingly drab . The movies not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they also promoted notions of masculinity and femininity that were impossible to live up to : gauze-clad harem beauties , supremely masculine men and scenes of dissolving sexual ecstasy ? enticing but unattainable images . This kind of mass-cultural conditioning produced a generation seething with sexual expectations that are not only highly unrealistic but also constantly being checked by America 's lingering Puritanism . Suffering from a sense of inferiority in comparison to the magnetic movie idols , and madly determined to preserve its youth and vitality , this generation is fundamentally disillusioned and angry at the farcically immense gap between the illusions they have been spoon-fed and the realities they inevitably find paltry . Ironically , the degree of disillusionment with adult life in America is more intense than elsewhere ? not only because there has been an extreme exposure to illusion but also because the chances of fulfilling wild fantasies are in fact more real here . When it is impossible to relinquish a fantasy and equally impossible to fulfill it , the stalemate is extraordinarily painful . Here , comedy provides one kind of solution : to reactivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun of it ; to turn it inside out in order to attack and enjoy it all over again at the same time . The satisfaction and release obtained by reactivating those fantasies which have in reality been very frustrating explains why the favorite subjects of modern comedy are : the standard movie formulas of the Thirties and Forties , characters from the comics and adventure radio programs , and the common symbols for American ideals . Furthermore , be-  | cause these images evoke a combination of hatred and nostalgia they serve as triggers for comic indignation . One of Lenny Bruce 's routines illustrates how symbolic American values can be exorcised by violent desecration . He tells how when the door-to-door saleswoman pushing a well-known brand of cosmetics called at his house , he drugged her , stripped her , decked her out with galoshes and a mustache , raped her and wrote on her belly in lipstick : " You were balled ! " Here , the lady is representative of The American Dream Girl , the type portrayed on film by June Allysonsweet , innocent , pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of candy . Bruce 's comic reduction of her is a vicious attack against an unattainable dream , an unrealizable fantasy . In this same vein , the literary version of the sick comic 's stand-up routine is presented in Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg 's novel , Candy . Although the more important of these two authors , Southern , is not Jewish , his satiric strategy is identical with Bruce 's . Again , an innocent girl ? one who keeps earnestly proclaiming that " to give of oneself is a thrilling privilege " ? is degraded and humiliated in scene after scene . To smash the tantalizing image , horribly and yet hilariously , is the purpose of the book . In Candy , however , it is not only the " Dream Girl " who is attacked . A whole gallery of cinema stereotypes is mocked and defiled : a bearded college professor , an ideal suburban couple , a whitecoated doctor . From begining to end this novel is a rollicking revenge on mass-culture illusions . The reactions of the current generation of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fantasies of the mass media are too complex to be contained within any formula ; already they have found outlets in Pop Art , camp and other styles that have no Jewish affinities . This disillusionment , however , has fused with the feelings of disenchantment , anger and ambivalence that are the stuff of Jewish humor ; and this fusion explains not only many of the symbols of this humor but also the source of its  | appeal to Americans generally . The overwhelming impact of the Jew on American humor today has meaning that is not suggested by the surface ripples made by Jewish fun books and the fad of Yiddish phrases . Jewishness itself has become a metaphor for modern life . The individual Jew ? the alien in search of identity ? has become a symbolic protagonist . As he dares more and more to expose his inner turmoil to self-satire , the Jew is discovering in turn that Americans are more and more receptive to his comic consciousness : to ironic mockery of personal plights , to bittersweet retreats from painful realities and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a symbolic representative for our time , his humor ? his great cultural weapon and consolation ? can now be appreciated in its raw form by millions of people who have no connection with the Jewish community and who are not even aware that what they are laughing at is Jewish humor . Explorations , 1967  | 1 . THE COMEDY OF LENNY BRUCE Since the shaman functions as a safety valve , and as a regulator of the psychic life of the clan , he lives under the permanent feeling of bearing a great responsibility . . . . Sometimes , if he loses control of the spirits , he must be killed . S. M. SHEROKOGROFF IN THE WINTER of 1962 in Chicago , the comedian Lenny Bruce was convicted of obscenity and sentenced to one year in jail and a $I , 000 fine . Shortly afterward , he was also convicted by a Los Angeles court of narcotics possession . These convictions , currently being appealed , are by no means the only run-ins Bruce has had with the authorities . Since returning from his world tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all : twice in Los Angeles on suspicion of narcotics possession ; four times for obscenity ( he was acquitted in San Francisco and Philadelphia ) ; and once for assault in  | Van Nuys , California . Earlier , he had been twice barred from entering England ; on the first occasion , he was turned back within an hour at the airport , when authorities simply denied him a work permit . The second time , entering England via Ireland , and bearing with him affidavits attesting to his probity , sobriety and general moral earnestness , Bruce was allowed to stay the night , only to become on the following day the subject of emergency intervention by the Home Secretary , who declared his presence not to be " in the public interest . " On these occasions , as in previous encounters with the agencies of law enforcement , Bruce showed himself courteous , even disarmingly so , to his antagonists and a trifle bewildered , it seemed , at the havoc he could create merely by turning up . He boarded a plane and went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " obscene " and " sick " ? and not only in the expected quarters ( Walter Winchell , Robert Ruark , assorted Variety pundits , etc. ) but by critics like Benjamin DeMott and Kenneth Alcott . On the other hand , of course , there are equally sophisticated critics like Robert Brustein and Kenneth Tynan who have arrived at opposite conclusions , finding Bruce not only essentially " healthy , " but the physician , as it were , for the illness from which all of us are suffering . While certain spokesmen for an American " underground " have claimed him for their own , Bruce has also earned a vast popular following , far exceeding the limits of any coterie . Long before his present notoriety , indeed , he was one of the most successful nightclub performers in the country , earning on the average $5,000 a week and with his record-album sales totaling well over ioo , 000 . Fellow comics are among Bruce 's keenest admirers and , if not always admitting their debt to him publicly , frequently reveal it by imitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of groups like the Establishment and Beyond the Fringe , who have been even more unstinting than the Americans in acknowledging both his fascination and his influence .  | What , then , explains Bruce 's unique effect ? Certainly , his impact can not be attributed to his material alone . By now , so completely have the so-called " sick " comics caught on ? and so quickly has the authentic radical satire of a few years ago been rendered innocuous by sheer acceptance and then imitation ? that it no longer requires daring , originality or courage to attack sacred cows like integration , Mother 's Day , the flag . Such things are done , albeit in diluted form , virtually on every network . Yet Bruce seems immune from that permissiveness that is in the end perhaps more subversive of true protest than censorship . Uniquely among members of his profession ( and matched in others perhaps only among jazz musicians ) , Bruce continues to shock , to infuriate , to be the subject on the one hand of a passionate and almost unprecedented advocacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persecution , so that today , at the height of his drawing power , it is doubtful whether a club in New York would dare to book him . Bruce slouches onstage in a crumpled black raincoat ( " dressed for the bust , " as he confidingly informs the audience , in anticipation of arrest ) , pale , unshaven , with long black sideburns ? beat , raffish , satanic . Ordering the lights up , he surveys the house : " Yeah . You 're good-looking . You got lotsa bread . " He pauses . " Good-looking chicks always got lotsa bread . That 's a hooker syllogism . " Having opened on this amiable note , he abruptly switches his tone and manner to lull the audience into temporary security , then launches into an apparently off-the-cuff discourse on themes of the moment : " You know ? Liberals will buy anything a bigot writes . They really support it . George Lincoln Rockwell 's probably just a very knowledgeable businessman with no political convictions whatsoever . He gets three bucks a head working mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wondering why there are so many Jews there . "  | Even in this relatively minor bit , the distinctive qualities of Bruce 's satire are in evidence : it is authentically shocking and nihilistic to a degree that is not altogether apparent at first . To make fun of liberals these days is an act of conventional daring ; to make fun of George Lincoln Rockwell these days is an act of slightly less conventional daring ; but to make fun of a " proper " moral response to George Lincoln Rockwell constitutes the violation of a taboo . What Bruce is doing by finding in George Lincoln Rockwell an ordinary businessman out for the main chance , goes far beyond the modish cliche of " the guilt we all share " ? it amounts to an implication of normality itself in the monstrous . Perhaps this accounts for the slightly hysterical quality of the laughter that his performances usually elicit . It is helplessness in the face of a truly nihilistic fury that makes the parody currently fashionable in the nightclubs and the off-Broadway theaters seem safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-congratulation , allows no comfortable perch from which the audience can look complacently down on the thing satirized . Even his " conventional " routines take a bizarre and violent course , which transforms them into something quite different from mere parody . There is one , for instance , in which an " ordinary white American " tries to put a Negro he has met at a party at ease . The predictable blunders with their underlying viciousness ( " That Joe Louis was a hell of a fighter . .. . Did you eat yet ? I 'll see if there 's any watermelon left . . . . " ) are within the range of any gifted satirist with his heart in the right place ; but Bruce gives the screw an added turn by making the protagonist , besotted with temporary virtue , a forthright and entirely ingenuous Jew-hater as well ? sincerely making common cause with the Negro . This is closer to surrealism than to simple farce , a fantasy on the subject of bigotry far more startling than a merely perfect sociological rendition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the routine proceeds , the fantasy gets wilder and wilder , with the white man becoming more  | and more insinuatingly confidential in his friendliness ( " What is it with you guys ? Why do you always want to do it to everybody 's sister ? . . . You really got a big wang on you , huh ? Hey , could I see it ? " ) and the Negro becoming progressively stiffer and more bewildered . Similarly , Bruce has a fairly conventional routine that might have been dreamed up in its general outline fifteen years ago by a stand-up comedian from the Lower East Side , but that he pushes to what would have been unthinkable lengths fifteen years ago . The performer , in the guise of himself , encounters a " typical " Jewish couple while on a Midwestern tour ; they are at first shy and admiring , until the inevitable question is asked and the discovery is made ? Bruce is Jewish ; then their respect and timidity give way first to a slightly insulting familiarity and finally to overt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once have been played for folksiness , becomes bizarre and disturbing when Bruce uses it to expose within the couple depths of prurient malevolence far in excess of their apparent " human " failings . The climax is an orgy of vituperation in the familial mode that becomes a glaring and devastating comment on Jewish life in America . Until a few years ago , this kind of humor had never been seen in a nightclub or theater . It appeared to be completely original , yet obviously it mined a rich , seemingly inexhaustible vein and was , moreover , enforced by a highly finished technique . Critics responded to Bruce at first as though he were sui generis , a self-created eccentric of genius without discernible origins . Yet nothing could be further from the truth . What Lenny Bruce is doing today in public had been done for years in private , not only by him but by dozens of amateurs all over New York City ? at private parties , on street corners , in candy stores . His originality consists in his having been the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his genius lies in his ability to express the ethos out of which he comes in unadulterated form . He is , in other words , a genuine folk artist who stands in a  | relation to the lower-middle-class adolescent Jewish life of New York not unlike that of Charlie Parker to the Negroes of Harlem . And like Parker , he derives his strength from having totally available to himself ? and then being able to articulate ? attitudes , ideas , images , fragments of experience so endemic to a culture that they scarcely ever come to conscious awareness . Thus for many people the shock of watching Bruce perform is primarily the shock of recognition . The psychological mechanism of this kind of comedy is well enough known by now : it is a means of expressing hatred and contempt and still escaping punishment . But the matter is complicated by the fact that the comic 's sensitivity to imperfection and ugliness is heightened by a conviction of his own inadequacy , vulgarity , and hypocrisy , leading him to become doubly intolerant of these faults in others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to exorcise by comic confrontation . The psychological source of such satire is , thus , a persistent , ineradicable hatred of the self , and this is particularly striking in the case of Bruce , whose sense of moral outrage is intimately connected with an awareness of his own corruption . ( " I ca n't get worked up about politics . I grew up in New York , and I was hip as a kid that I was corrupt and that the mayor was corrupt . I have no illusions . " ) If the practitioner of this kind of comedy is in any way morally superior to his audience , it is only because he is honest , and willing to face himself , while they , the audience , are blind enough to think they are pure . Lenny Bruce is not , as one might suppose , a product of the New York urban ghetto . He grew up in an Andy Hardy town on Long Island and never spoke a Yiddish word till he was twenty-five . He served during the war on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salerno , Anzio , etc. ) , and only after the war did he drift into the show-business jungle of Times Square , encouraged by the example of his mother , Sally Marr , who had moved during the war years from a suburban dancing school to a skimpy  | career as an M.C. and comedienne . For several years , Bruce moved around digging other comics , haunting their hangouts , trying to work out an act of his own . Finally , in 1949 , he appeared on the Arthur Godfrey talent show and won . Soon he was doing a conventional " single " at the Strand and other presentation houses , but he loathed " the business " and often thought about deserting for the merchant marine or some other less meretricious profession . The decisive moment for his career came in 1957 while Bruce was working on the West Coast as a screen writer and burlesque comic . At about this time Mort Sahl , also on the Coast , was becoming famous . ( " I was just a product of my time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for someone to pick it up . " ) The novelty of Sahl 's act undoubtedly stimulated Bruce 's breakthrough and helped establish an audience ready to respond to Bruce 's first original creation : a series of satirical bits based on a potent symbol evolved in the early " home-cooking " days ? the shingle man . A type of " con " man prevalent after the war , the shingle man spent much of his time on the road , usually traveling in groups , doing comic routines , smoking marijuana , taking time off now and then to talk gullible slum residents into buying new roofing . Though strictly a small-time operator , the ruthlessly manipulating shingle man came , in Bruce 's universe , to represent any and all wielders of power and authority ? up to and including the most grandiose . The great world , in short ? all political , social or religious activity ? is nothing but a gigantic racket run by shingle men . In a Bruce routine called " Religion , Inc. , " for example , organized religion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy Graham and Oral Roberts making plans in hipster jargon ( " Hey , John ! What 's shaking , baby ? " ) for a world-wide religious revival complete with giveaway items ( a cigarette lighter in the form of a cross and cocktail napkins bearing the imprint " Another martini  | for Mother Cabrini " ) . Similarly , in another routine of this period , Bruce portrays Hitler as the brainstorm of a couple of shrewd theatrical agents , who discover the new " star " while he is painting their office and set him up with costumes ( an armband with the four " 7 's " ) , music , routines ? in short , an act . Lavishly applying the metaphor of the shingle man to every social institution in the book , Bruce embarked upon a career whose underlying intention has remained constant , though his style has gone through many changes : to set up a remorselessly unqualified identification of power and respectability with corruption . It is a mistake to regard Bruce simply as a social satirist , for he has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has long since gone beyond mere irreverence in his routines . Indeed , for the most apposite metaphor describing what Bruce does , one must turn from show business to the seemingly remote domain of cultural anthropology . Geza Roheim 's description of the shaman , exorciser of public demons , sharply reveals the true character of Lenny Bruce 's present " act . " " In every primitive tribe we find the shaman in the center of society and it is easy to show that he is either a neurotic or a psychotic , or at least that his art is based on the same mechanisms as a neurosis or psychosis . The shaman makes both visible and public the systems of symbolic fantasy that are present in the psyche of every adult member of society . They are the leaders in an infantile game and the lightning conductors of common anxiety . They fight the demons so that others can hunt the prey and in general fight reality . " Although " sick " humor appears to be a remarkably unfeeling reaction to misery , particularly to physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforced repression of those instinctive emotions of revulsion , anxiety and guilt evoked by deformity . It represents a distorted rebellion against the piety that demands automatic sympathy  | for literally every form of human limitation . Though neither Mort Sahl nor Bruce can be wholly identified with " sick " comedy , the shock techniques used by both gave them something in common with the outrageous jokes that were spreading through the country during the middle and late Fifties . ( With Sahl , also , Bruce shares other things : the technique of the encyclopedic monologue , the courage to deal in forbidden subjects , the use of hipster language and an obvious identification with the jazz world . ) For a time Bruce 's act was sprinkled with " sick " jokes , but they never constituted more than a small portion of his verbal arsenal . Unlike Sahl , however , whose specialty is political satire , Bruce has never had much to say about politics ; the abuse is too obvious . There is a further difference : Sahl is primarily a wit and a social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , which has enabled him to produce a remarkable variety of characters , situations , and lines of comic action . The next stage in Bruce 's development saw the shingle man superseded by a richer , more personal metaphor ? show business itself . Balancing his own profound self-contempt against his loathing for the " business , " Bruce created his most complex parable , a routine called " The Palladium . " A cocksure little nightclub comic , crude , untalented , but " on the make " for success , is disgusted with working the " toilets " ( second-rate clubs ) and determines to take a crack at the big-time . Booked into the London Palladium , he is slated to follow " Georgia Gibbs , " a performer who knows exactly what the public wants and " puts them away " every time . His vulgar , corny gags fail to get a laugh and he " dies . " Desperate to succeed , he begs for another chance , but is swamped in the wake of the singer , who caps her cunningly contrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died over there . " The little comic lacks the wit to change even a single line of his mechanical act , and again he is about to " die " when , confronting disaster , he blindly ad fibs a line : " Hey , folks , how ' bout this one ? screw the Irish ! " This puerile bid for  | attention instantly transforms the somnolent audience into a raging mob who sweep the comic off the stage and wreck the theater . Clearly , show business for Bruce stands for American society itself ? and , indeed , in no other country have entertainers come to be more profoundly symbolic of national values than here . The anxiety to please which takes the form of tear-jerking sentimentality and fake humanitarianism in " Georgia Gibbs " is no less ruthlessly dramatized in the portrait of the brash little comedian , whom we can take as a comic degradation of Bruce himself , and whose story is a reflection of Bruce 's own development . Not only does he expose the agonies that assault the performer whose very life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satirizes one of the most remarkable features of his own present role as shaman ? the direct , brutal onslaught on the passions and prejudices of his audience that stems from desperation in the face of failure and that sets off an appalling explosion of primitive hatred . While he lacks the dramatic gifts of Elaine May , Sid Caesar or Jonathan Winters ? with their actors ' techniques of mimicry , foreign accents , and sound effects ? Bruce is nevertheless at his best in personal narratives put across with just a suggestion of the dramatic . His work , in fact , is intensely personal and provides an obvious outlet for his private rage ; nevertheless , there is a part of Bruce that is utterly disinterested . Like any satirist , he knows that the only effective way to attack corruption is to expose and destroy it symbolically ; that the more elaborately and vividly this destruction is imagined , the greater will be his own satisfaction , and the more profound the cathartic effect on the audience . Thus , gradually moving from a wholly conventional act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce has indeed become the shaman : he has taken on himself the role of exorcising the private fears and submerged fantasies of the public by articulating in comic form the rage and nihilistic savagery hidden beneath the lid of  | social inhibition . In one of his recent routines Bruce orders the house lights out and then announces : " Now , you know what 's going to happen ? I 'm going to piss on the audience . The clapping is from those who had it before and enjoyed it . " This promise of outrage is not kept , but is followed rather by Bruce 's version of how the audience had reacted . " What did he say ? " Bruce asks , taking the part of a male patron , " Did he say he 's gon na S ' on us ? " Now he mimics a woman 's voice : " Oh , shut up , Harry ! He does it real cute . " This routine vividly illustrates Bruce 's attitude toward his audience ; he regards it as an object of sadistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enticing enemy , and he attacks it repeatedly . In the past his aggression was masked , but now it is naked . He may pick up a chair and menace a patron ; if the audience laughs , he will observe soberly that he might have killed the man and that if he had , everyone would have accepted the murder as part of the act . Here he demonstrates , almost in the manner of a classroom exercise , the repressed violence of modern society . By making the audience laugh at incipient murder , he has tricked them into exposing their own savage instincts . The implication is that given the slightest excuse for condoning a killing , even the absurd rationale of its being part of a nightclub act , society would join eagerly in the violence it so conscientiously deplores . This public display of the ugly , the twisted , the perverse ? offensive though it is at times ? nevertheless , serves a vital function , for it gives the audience a profound sense , not only of release , but of self-acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he does not die ! Like the witch doctor or the analyst , he brings the unconscious to light and thereby lightens the burden of shame and guilt . By its very nature his material can not come out clear , decorous and beautifully detached ; it must be , and is , charged with self-pity , self-hatred , fear , horror , crudity , grotesquerie . What is unsatisfactory in Bruce 's work is his frequent failure to transmute his rage into real comedy . Sometimes he  | has nothing more to offer than an attitude ( " Everything is rotten . Mother is rotten . The flag is rotten . God is rotten . " ) . At other times , what starts with a promise of rounded development will flatten out into a direct and insulting statement . A sophisticated listener forgives the comic these lapses , understanding that the ad lib approach and the often intractable material are apt to betray the performer into mere obscenity ; but people with no natural sympathy for this approach are shocked and offended ? there has never been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce 's act . The reason for these occasional lapses into crudity is the almost total lack of " art " in Bruce 's present act ; he deliberately destroys the aesthetic distance that is a convention of the theater , established by tacit agreement between audience and performer that what is happening on the stage is an illusion of life rather than life itself . Like other performers who deal in direct communication , Bruce has always tried to reduce the barrier between the stage and reality . He has never wanted to appear as an entertainer doing an act , but rather as himself , no different onstage from off , not really a performer , but a man who performs in order to share with others his most secret thoughts and imaginings . The desire , however , to eradicate the distinction between art and reality has at this stage almost completely destroyed the artistry with which Bruce formerly presented his material . Gone , now , are the metaphors of the shingle man and the show business manipulator ; gone , too , are the storytelling devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that remains are sketchy , often underdeveloped , sometimes incoherent scraps of former routines . The new material consists of deep , psychologically primitive fantasies , hurled at a defenseless audience without the mitigating intervention of art . Frequently , Bruce assaults his listeners with scatological outbursts consisting of the crudest and most obvious anal and oral sadistic fantasies , undisguised.  | Much of his current material is in fact unquotable ? not so much because of the language but because its comic effect depends on nonverbal associations and is thereby scarcely intelligible in the reading . In one long and complicated routine , which changes from one performance to another , he explains that the Lone Ranger 's bullets are really pellets of Ehrlich 's 6o6 ( " That 's why he keeps his mouth tightly shut " ) and that the Lone Ranger is a homosexual ( " Bring Tonto here . I wish to commit an unnatural act . Wait a minute ! Bring the horse too ! " ) . ( This deliberate perpetration of outrage on the persons of the most innocuous figures of American folklore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , one of the leitmotifs of the recent " sick " humor . The same thing was once done in a grimier way in those pornographic comic books that showed the heroes of the comic strip ? familiar to every American child ? in complicated sexual situations . ) As his material has become more direct , Bruce has tended more and more to be the act . Because the imaginative impulse is naked , unsublimated , Bruce 's intention is less and less communicated by what he says , and depends now , to a great extent , on affective devices ? his manner , his tone , especially his physical appearance . Whereas in the past Bruce would walk briskly out on the floor , good-looking , impeccably groomed , wearing a chic Italian suit , now he comes on stifflegged and stooped , wearing shabby clothes , his face a pale mask of dissipation . Having discarded the civilized mask that people wear in public to protect themselves , Bruce comes before his audience as a mythic figure-beat , accused junkie , " underground " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden desires . Where they are cautious , he is selfdestructive , alternately terrifying the audience ( the very fact that he does n't care is awesome ) and arousing their sympathy and concern . ( He now regularly opens , his act by enacting and commenting on his recent arrests . ) Merely looking at Bruce these days is a disturbing experience . Finally , Bruce is dramatizing his role as shaman by embel-  | lishing his act for the first time with consciously contrived bits of hocus-pocus . He turns the lights on and off , strikes drums and cymbals , swings into crude chants . He prowls about the stage , sometimes exposing himself to the audience , at other times crouching in the darkness and hiding from it . He opens and closes doors and climbs onto furniture to symbolize his power over the bewildered spectators . In the darkened , cavelike club , charged with tension , the audience sits hunched over , tense , breathless , their eyes fastened on the weird figure in the center of the magic circle . While the tribe looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a trance in preparation for the terrible struggle with the tribal demons ( anxieties ) . And then ? when the performance is over and the " unspeakable " has been shouted forth ? there is mingled with the thunderous applause a sigh of release . Purged of their demons by the shaman , the tribe has been freed , for the moment , to " hunt the prey and in general fight reality . " Commentary , 1963 2 . ONE LAW FOR THE LION AND OX On December 21 , 1964 , the comedian Lenny Bruce was sentenced in a New York court to four months in the workhouse for giving " obscene , indecent , immoral and impure " performances in violation of Section 114o-a of the Penal Law . Thus ended the longest , costliest , most vigorously contested and widely publicized trial of an American artist or entertainer in recent years ? and perhaps the most exhaustive judicial investigation ever undertaken of allegedly obscene performances . In bringing together all the parties affected by censorship ? the performer himself , the avant-garde who rushed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the offended middle class represented by the  | magistrates ? the Bruce trial dramatically demonstrated the inadequacy of the current legal code to deal with the complex and conflict-laden issues of the sexual content of modern art and entertainment . After nine months of legal maneuvers , thousands of pages of expert testimony and the lengthy deliberations of the bench , this trial left everyone who has been associated with it profoundly dissatisfied . The three-judge panel split its decision , with the dissenting magistrate , J. Randall Creel , writing , " the judicial process revealed itself as a most limited and inadequate , if not improper tool for determining what is obscene . " The defendant broke openly with his distinguished liberal attorney ( who promptly sued him ) and assumed his own defense , stating that he believed in censorship and did not wish to be exonerated at the cost of weakening the law . The sophisticated public opinion that had championed Bruce in the early course of the trial changed during the muddled final phase to disgust . By the time sentence was passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision or the defendant . What had gone wrong ? How had all the care and work and expertise produced such a frustrating result ? The first and most obvious culprit was the law itself . Or perhaps one should say the laws , for though Bruce was indicted under a New York City ordinance ? an archaic statute whose anxiously overlapping adjectives had never been clarified because the law had been so rarely invoked ? the character of his trial was really determined by state laws that have frequently been tested and refined through appeals to the Supreme Court . Every American state except New Mexico has now adopted the definition of " obscenity " promulgated by the Supreme Court in 1957 : " Obscene " means that to the average person , applying contemporary standards , the predominant appeal of the matter , taken as a whole , is to prurient interest , i.e. ,  | a shameful or morbid interest in nudity , sex or excretion , which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and is matter which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worded statement may appear , it has given rise to endless legal arguments . Thus it has been said that what constitutes " shameful " or " morbid " interest ( except in the most extreme cases ) is likely to be decided not as a matter of law but as the highly subjective reaction of the individual judge . " Prurience , " the key term , has been defined by high authorities in two distinctly different formulas : as " inciting lustful thoughts " or as " filthy and disgusting . " Lenny Bruce has always operated according to the former notion ; but his judges condemned him under the latter interpretation , ruling that though the comedian 's monologues were not erotic , " they insulted sex and debased it. , , Just as crucial as the problem presented by relative interpretations of the statute 's wording is the objection that the yardstick of the " average person " is utterly inappropriate to a complex society and particularly to such a heterogeneous community as New York City . As if to destroy whatever semblance of reality this legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of the Bruce trial that the " average " was to be understood as a national , not a local standard ? as the average of 18o million people ! Yet despite the extreme permissiveness with which the Supreme Court has applied the law of obscenity in recent years ( and many have been the complaints that the Court has virtually wiped out the law ) , a performer like Lenny Bruce still stands in jeopardy . For Bruce 's work is the expression of an underground society of Jewish hipsters whose very identity consists of parodying and therefore defying conventional American values and whose language and humor reeks of " filth " because obscenity is this society 's  | basic gesture of defiance and liberation . After habituation to this hipster underworld , its verbal violence and coarse manners cease to offend ; but for people like Bruce 's judges , Roman Catholic or Protestant , middle-class and well-bred , such a style must appear an intolerable violation of public decorum . But it is the last clause in the definition of obscenity ( " redeeming social importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce trial . Because this single clause affords blanket coverage to art , Bruce 's defenders concentrated on presenting him as a brilliant , mordant satirist of modern society . The judges , on the other hand , saw the " satire "  --  which mvas in fact primitive and incoherent ? as " a device for exploiting the use of obscene language . " Accusers and defenders alike failed to perceive the true character of Bruce 's performances , which are in a manner of speaking magical and therefore outside the customary area of relations between art and the law . Bruce 's " art , " like that of the shaman in primitive society , depends primarily on his ability to locate and expose the fears and resentments ? the " demons " ? that beset and torment his audience . Lacking the elaborate artifices of a Genet , Bruce goes about his exorcism in an intuitively direct manner by violating verbal taboos or offering threats of violence or outrage . Then , having laid bare through these shock tactics the elementary emotions and fantasies of his hearers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away all this perilous stuff . It will be evident from even so simple an explanation as this that Lenny Bruce must be " offensive " to be effective , and that the test for whether his work possesses " redeeming social value " lies in a judgment of his success in utilizing obscenity for cathartic effect . Such a judgment could he just only if it were based on actual observation of the comedian 's performance , for his words are often only a kind of commentary on what he does ; but all the evidence available to the court was half-audible tape recordings and transcripts  | disfigured by mistakes of every description . Faced with this difficult situation , the Bruce defense tried to simplify the performer 's highly problematic relation to society by applying to his work as it appeared in the transcripts a thick coat of whitewash . A parade was organized of critics , columnists , editors , professors and clergymen who testified that they found nothing offensive in the comedian 's language , gestures and fantasies , though these form one of the densest scatological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said in justification of the intelligence and taste of at least some of these witnesses that they were deliberately overstating their position to protect the defendant from what they regarded as a prejudiced and ill-informed tribunal . But even allowing for strategy , it was quite apparent that most of these liberal intellectual witnesses were not properly responsive to the effective energies of Bruce 's performances . ( Regrettably , none of them had actually witnessed the performances . ) A crucial irony , therefore , began to emerge at quite an early point in the trial : Bruce 's defenders were in one sense less firmly in contact with his work than were his judges , who felt at least the shock of outrage . This basic failure of rapport erupted finally in disagreements between Bruce and his attorneys on the question of his defense strategy . The lawyers , who had never seen Bruce perform , and were less interested in defending his art than in simply getting their client off , wanted to challenge the constitutionality of the law under which he had been indicted . Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to have his case tried exclusively on its merits . Though he did not say so publicly , the comedian probably recognized that he and his defenders were not really at one in their attitudes toward his work and that the whole tendency of the defense was toward destroying the very restrictions on which he had spent years carefully structuring his performances . At last Bruce went into court and informed the startled judges that he could no longer " communicate " with his counsel ( a felici-  | tous choice of words ) . Later , he was quoted in a newspaper as saying , " I believe in censorship . I believe in the watchdog . " Bruce 's break with the liberal ? avant-garde coalition that had so vigorously and efficiently defended him provided the most ironic and revealing moment in the entire legal drama . It demonstrated anew the performer 's integrity and courage . Before this act he was sure of eventual acquittal merely by playing the role assigned him by his supporters ? that of the blameless artist persecuted by an uncomprehending world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , struggling singlehanded with the overwhelming complexities of the law and scorned most by those whose help he had rejected . As a man dedicated to honesty , however , Lenny Bruce could not lend himself to a philosophy that his own experience contradicted in every detail . Instinctively , he knew that by contributing to the attrition of the law he would be weakening the social taboos which the law protects , and that once these taboos were wiped out the valuable cathartic effects of symbolically violating them would also be lost ? that , in short , the possibility of his magic would be destroyed . And as a veteran performer , Bruce knew only too well the evil effects of constantly giving way before the irresponsible demands of the audience for greater license ; he had felt , as no critic or lawyer had ever felt , that self-defiling compulsion to please by complying with the crowd 's cowardly craving for vicarious violence . Indeed , it had been the ennui of sophisticated nightclub audiences , accustomed to hearing everything and therefore responsive to nothing , that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly , then , he less than anyone could go along with the liberal cant of " removing barriers to freedom of expression . " Faced with the possibility of having to plunge into provocative acts through the loss of affective content in words and fantasies , he found himself siding with his judges and advocating the values of censorship . If the application of the law to the satirist is fraught with  | problems and paradoxes , it is equally so with respect to the avant-garde , which was also on trial in New York at the same time . Jonas Mekas , the founder of the Film-Makers ' Cooperative and the prophet of the underground movie world , was tried under the same law as Bruce , convicted but given a suspended sentence . Flaming Creatures by Jack Smith and Un Chant d'Amour by Jean Genet , the former portraying orgy , the latter masturbation and homosexual rape , were the films for which Mekas was arrested ? and it is films , traditionally the most oppressively censored of the arts , on which today 's avant-garde and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vastly different from that of a Lenny Bruce ; for , like many satirists , Bruce is essentially an inverted Puritan who sees art as a means for symbolically revenging frustrated innocence and idealism . The avant-garde , on the other hand , are genuine radicals who reject alike the alternatives of art or conformity and insist on the right to act out the lifeaffirming impulses which they are convinced will establish the earthly paradise . Unlike the old Bohemia ( how quaint that word sounds today ! ) which existed primarily to provide the artist with a stimulating , nonrepressive milieu in which he could freely work , this generation 's Bohemia ? a cool camp staked out in the heart of a swarming slum on the Lower East Side of New York ? uses creative activity as a rationale for a way of life that is an inversion of conventional middle-class patterns . Rejecting marriage , eschewing work for money , overturning social taboos and seizing on every means for heightening the impact of experience , such as " consciousness-expanding " drugs and sexual experimentation , these beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clash with American society is a class war fought under the banners of art . The potential influence of the avant-garde is far greater than is generally believed , for contrary to what most people think and what the avant-garde itself proclaims , its relation to American society is more an echo than a defiant chal-  | lenge . It is characteristic of the cultural life of America at this time that every phenomenon of art and manners should reveal the twin features of antagonism to authority and the failure of sublimation . The whole tendency of the avantgarde " revolution " is toward an ever greater degree of infantilism and regression , an acting out of ever more rudimentary fantasies of sex , anger and narcissism . As these are precisely the same tendencies that are slowly coming to the surface of middle-class conformity , the avant-garde is merely a projection of the mass unconscious . Surely it is no accident that in its latest and best publicized phase , called " camp , " the avant-garde has embraced with the nostalgia of unrelinquished childhood all the most blatant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the horror films , from the cut-outs on the backs of cereal boxes to the flaring poster of the unattainable movie queen . The values of innocence ? spontaneity , candor , " luv " ? and the emblems of American childhood make a very appealing demagogy for the cultural regressionary . Confronted with the sudden collapse of legal barriers that have stood for hundreds of years as safeguards of public decency and morality and constantly provoked by a militant avant-garde who ape the tactics of civil disobedience developed in the civil rights struggle , it is natural that the conservative elements in the community should seek to reestablish the institution of censorship through legal or social instrumentalities . But it seems equally clear that censorship is an institution that has failed by the test of experience . Every recent attempt to apply it through legal action has resulted in the sort of confused and frustrating litigation that characterized the trial of Lenny Bruce . Ideally , there could be a censorship law elastic enough to permit the private showing of such films as Un Chant d'Amour while at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as objectionable and corrupting . Ideally , there could be a law that would be so clear in its stipulations as to what is " obscene " that a social satirist could gauge precisely that  | split-fraction where he appears to be beyond the fringe but is actually just within the protection of the law . But such ideals can not be realized in practice , and the attempt to attain them through the elaboration of an explicit and exhaustive code would undoubtedly create a whole set of problems hitherto unglimpsed . Obviously , censorship rests on conditions of social homogeneity and respect for authority that are waning in a country like the United States . Blake 's proverb , " one law for the lion &; ox is oppression , " has for us a meaning that becomes more poignant every day . Censorship No. 2 , 1965 3 . THE ELECTRIC RESURRECTION OF SAINT LENNY BRUCE Death always loved Lenny Bruce . But Lenny was coy and would n't surrender . He clung to life with the tenacity of a dying comic . Even after he lost his audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness , he struggled on through court after court , obsessed with his dream of self-vindication . Finally , he got so tired and sick , he had to lie down . Death was gratified . She lifted her lover into show-biz heaven and restored to him everything he had lost ? plus much more . The public bought his act as never before , the courts reversed his conviction for obscenity and the dirty comic became a bearded saint of the pop pantheon . So now let us celebrate Saint Lenny and his miraculous Electric Resurrection . Repeat after me . Lenny is dead . Lenny lives . Long live Lenny dead ! The week before he died , Lenny Bruce was so broke and so short of friends that he had to hustle his parole officer for ten bucks . Last year he earned ? guess ! ? $100,000 . Heavy , right ? But bupkas compared with what he 'll gross next year . Lenny is really moving now . Has his mind on business all  | the time . Look at the deals he 's lined up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract : a three-million-dollar Lenny Bruce Story , to be written by Bruce Jay Friedman . Then , there 's The Essential Lenny Bruce , the paperback shtickbook , selling at 5,000 per week with 300,000 copies in readers ' hands . Soon it 'll be time for a sequel : how does The Private Lenny Bruce hit you ? The future ? Got it covered , baby . There will he a series of records based on the book , one record for each chapter till the act dies . By that time the full-length biography will be out with all the insane tales from Lenny 's secret life . In the planning stage are the really far-out things , like the multimedia mix with actors , film , tapes , still photos projected on six screens and white vinyl weather balloons ? the whole psychedelic apparatus focused on a Theater of Lenny Bruce . What really happened ? The answer is as simple as a deposit slip . Live , Lenny was a problem . Dead , Lenny is a property . Live , Lenny was worse than obscene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the First Amendment . I mean , really ! Dead , Lenny is this beautiful myth . He 's got Esthetic Distance now , and the wild thing about E.D. is that once you 've got it , the more whacked-out your behavior , the better for the legend . People will dig anything , providing it 's no threat to them . They thrill to the war on TV . They ca n't read enough about the horrors of the ghetto . They never commit themselves to a hero until he 's been assassinated . Well , mister , Lenny Bruce qualifies . What is more , Lenny dead is Lenny docile . A dead comic can be sorted , sifted , filtered and distilled . You can pick out the good parts and throw the rest away . In the trade it 's called " packaging , " and Bruce 's packager is one of the best , Alan Douglas of Douglas International . Alan is the part of show business that most people never discover ; which is a shame , because in this period of minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performers are the guys whose heads are permanently tipped into telephones . Sitting high above the city in his suite at the Plaza re-  | cently , Alan leaned across his carved Florentine table , and with occasional interruptions to answer his phone , enshrined before a Hieronymus Bosch facsimile , he explained to me the secret of the Lenny Bruce comeback . As he spoke , I tried packaging him . Face : elongated , refined , sardonic ; figure : lean , elegant , dressed in Edwardian clothes ; hair : AfroJewish bushman ; speech : New York Forties hipster with cultural overlay . Alan was saying that when Lenny died , he arranged with Lenny 's mother , Sally Marr , to become estate representative . The estate did n't amount to much : a couple of boxes of carelessly labeled tapes , a mountain of legal documents and some private papers . In the hands of a less expert merchandiser , the stuff would have barely sufficed for a hack-written biography . Alan had other plans , however ; he studied the Bruce property like a Sephardic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he split Lenny into pieces , he knew exactly where to put them . Into one package he bundled the life-story rights , research materials for a biography , a well-known director ( Stewart Rosenberg ) and producer ( Marvin Worth ) . Columbia bought it . Then , he renegotiated the Ballantine book deal ( one of Lenny 's fast-buck promotions ) so that it would entail copying and editing all the remaining tapes . Ballantine bought it . Meanwhile , to protect his product , he had to buy off some schlocky operators who would have stunk up the market . His work is n't finished yet , but Alan figures he 's sold all the gems , why push with the baguettes ? As we sat talking in his elegant office in New York 's most luxurious hotel , my mind began to back-pedal to that other room , downtown in the Marlton Hotel on Eighth Street , where I used to visit Lenny during 1964 , the year of his great legal battle in New York . What a dump it was ! I would sit uneasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecker 's ball to come through the wall . Green was the color of the room and the carpet looked like it had been dyed with old bottles of India ink . There was so much unstrung , twisted magnetic tape over everything , the furniture  | appeared to be floating in the Sargasso Sea . Lenny lived looped in tape . He was that character Beckett put on the stage . Krapp , the man whose every act and word came back to him eerily echoing out of a machine . We would be talking , when suddenly ? without a word of preparation ? Lenny would touch a button and his voice would emerge from a tape recorder . Then , he 'd get that look on his face that a ventriloquist wears when he 's listening to his dummy , that unnaturally fixed , attentive yet abstracted look that masks the secret working of his throat . Lenny liked to look at himself in the vocal mirror , but he was outraged when the reflection was falsified , which was a common occurrence during his trials because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or police officers doing his material ? to the best of their recollections ? and lousing it up . " They bomb and I serve their time , " was Lenny 's view of the situation . Even more infuriating were the mistakes the court stenographer would make in the record : Lenny would say " Loew 's Pitcairn " and the dumb , prejudiced clerk would hear it as " Loew 's tit can . " To expose this distortion , Lenny decided to smuggle into the courtroom a tape recorder secreted in an attache case . I recall picking up the case one day and being astonished by its weight . " Zug gornisht ! " ( Do n't say a word ! ) , he warned , whispering the secret in my ear ; then he strode jauntily down the aisle to the lawyer 's table , where the forbidden spools quietly revolved all during the trial , catching every remark ? even those the judge ordered stricken from the record . Lenny loved the idea of turning against the police the same devices they used to entrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorders strapped to their bodies and mikes in their tie pins ; they taught Lenny a lot . Once , he decided to extract a confession from a Los Angeles coffeehouse proprietor who would not admit in court that he had refused to hire Lenny because of pressure from the DA 's office . Lenny had his mother , Sally Marr ? a top ba-  | nana when they all worked in burlesque ? fitted out with a recorder whose microphone was hidden under a couple of Band-Aids . She went to the club and heard the owner admit that he was being pressured from " downtown . " But Sally was so anxious about the apparatus secreted on her body that when she idly dipped a fork in water she imagined an electric current was running up her arm . Wildly she jumped up and ran out of the club , knocking over chairs , waiters , patrons . When she got home , Lenny discovered that the tapes had been installed the wrong way . After the tape recorder , Lenny Bruce 's favorite instrument was the telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle his calls . When the phone rang , he would screen the call with his fake-out voice , a low indistinct sound like someone just waked from sleep or speaking through a black veil at a funeral . When he had placed the caller , he would abruptly modulate to the appropriate key . If it was a lawyer , he would sound brisk , technical , obsessed with detail ; numbers , Latin jargon , exotic names like Jacobellis ( an important precedent ) would fly through the air . The next call might be a show-biz buddy . " Sweetie , bubbee , baby , what 's with mother 's little rapist ? No , man , I 'm booked to play the Village Theater ? dig , the show is called Lenny Bruce Speaks for Profit , Tiny Tim Sings for Love . ' Beautiful ? " Or it might be a woman , which called for very low tones and the most extreme obscurity of language , really no language , just a series of " Hi . No . That 's sweet . Later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closed oral circuit that ran from mind to mouth to ear and back to mind again . He was virtually illiterate . When he had to write a letter , he always looked for an amanuensis . Or if the situation was an especially urgent one , he could scratch out a few words , using a combination of fourth-grade block lettering and a handwriting that wandered psychedelically all over the page in drooping sentences that looked like Dali watches . I remember receiving one of these rare epistles after the appearance  | of my first review of Lenny . He had gone to England hoping to profit from the liberal attitude toward narcotics addicts , and also , I suspect , hoping that the English would treat him with more dignity than his American audience . His reception soon cured these delusions ; no one met him at the plane except some officials , who subjected him to a brutal examination for drugs and then packed him off on the next plane to America . In mid-air he decided to write to his soul mate , who had published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he addressed a postcard " To my love friend , Goldie " ; then he printed , " Best review I ever received . " But what was really on his mind was the horrible indignity to which he had been subjected ; on the nightclub floor , he would have done twenty minutes on the whole scene , really gotten it out of his system ? but here in the cabin of this dumb Air India plane , what the hell could you do ? He would try : " Deported ! How sad ! " No , it was impossible . But here 's an idea : take this dopey magazine with the pictures of these goyische punims , cut out the faces , paste them around the lip of an envelope and caption them . Now this is getting to be fun . Hmmm , here 's a square-faced Irishman ; write , " For no apparent reason , Pat rubs minority groups the wrong way . Tried everything to overcome it . Does Jewish dialect : oy , oy , Abie trow de key to Ikey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny ! Now , I need a closer ? got it . " Pat has four stitches over right eye . " One of the strangest features of a visit with Lenny Bruce was the conversation conducted through the half-open door of the bathroom . Lenny spent so much time in the john that I was willing to credit the report which placed him there at the time of his death . The author of How to Talk Dirty was an obsessively clean man . Every day he would swill glasses of mineral water , administer enemas to himself , bathe several times and repeatedly change his clothes . He would dictate his legal correspondence from the john and , of course , he retired there to inject drugs . The association between drugs and going to the bathroom is a common one ; in  | Lenny 's case it was obviously strong because he felt compelled to flush the poison out of his system with incessant irrigations . Even his use of the hypodermic syringe had an unmistakable anal character ; instead of simply injecting the drug and removing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirt it back in the vein , until finally he released the junk . The use of " dirty " material in his act was not simply a strategy to shock the audience ; it grew out of his own anal obsessions . The word " toilet " was constantly coming up in his conversation : second-rate clubs were " toilets " ; when things went wrong , you went " into the toilet . " The most powerful imagery of his fascinating comic picture book , Stamp Help Out , is anal . On the cover there is a remarkable photograph of Lenny stripped to the waist like a heroic frontiersman smashing a toilet bowl with an axe . Inside is a droll picture of him sitting nude on the toilet with a thoughtful expression on his face : the toilet thinker . The copy begins with a cry of anal anguish , as Lenny berates the " dopey , Commie toilet " and explains that it has no power to harm . This , of course , was his key insight : that dirt ? of thought , language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilet meant conquering the fears of pollution with which his mind must have been long obsessed . As Lenny became increasingly obsessed with his legal affairs , he lost interest in his career . Like so many people in show business , he found the profession contemptible and the achievement of success unreal . One of the basic themes of his work was show business as the great imposture , the symbol of every form of hypocrisy , deceit and ulterior manipulation , from the campy antics of Adolf Hitler to the tent shows of Billy Graham and the solemn performances of Cardinal Spellman . The obvious question raised by this attitude was how Bruce could go on being a part of the business while regarding it with such profound contempt . The answer came with his first arrests for obscenity .  | Originally , Lenny had no intention of conducting a freespeech crusade . He saw his first " bust " as excellent publicity and told his lawyer they should capitalize on the notoriety . Soon , however , he became aware of the real danger presented by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active part in the preparation of his defense ; from involvement he soon escalated to obsession . Being a great enlister and manipulator of people , he applied the same charm that had won him audiences to the recruiting of legal assistance . My role , for example , was that of academic ponce . I was supposed to line up attorneys from Columbia 's Law School who would do Lenny 's bidding . For once he really got into the act , he expected to receive top billing . Lawyers were simply straight men and fall guys who had to be kept in their places because , like all minor talents , they were jealous of the star . I sometimes found myself at my office in Lewisohn Hall talking on the phone like some wheedling agent with an especially cranky client . " Lenny , this one is the real thing : Harvard Law , SNCC background , Supreme Court experience , only twenty-seven ? thinks you 're an artist ! " " No , man , " the funny nasal voice would come back , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who swings with the First Amendment . " And the search would go on and on and on . Lenny 's principal helpers were women . He was always surrounded by a galaxy of females , each of whom had her special role . Sally , his mother , and Honey , his wife , were the only permanent members of his stock company . They pretty well symbolized the two sides of woman without any third party . Sally 's relationship with Lenny was always that of pal and playmate . During the war , while Lenny was in the service , Sally graduated from mistress of a dancing school to professional comic and M.C. " I just got up and talked , " is her way of explaining a career that was a remarkable anticipation of her son 's . When Lenny got out of the navy ( by pretending to be a homosexual ) , he decided to follow Sally into the  | business . Sally was surprised by his decision : " That malted milk face ! I never thought he had any talent . " Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she used her connections on Broadway and broke Lenny in on the amateur nights he described so amusingly in How to Talk Dirty . After Lenny 's marriage to Honey Harlowe , a gorgeous Rita Hayworth-style beauty who worked as a stripper and drove around in a pink convertible with leopard-skin upholstery and her name blazoned on the outside , " Hot Honey Harlowe , " Sally saw much less of her son . Lenny and Honey moved to the West Coast ; Sally continued working in New York . But Lenny had to have his mother near him , so he arranged to have Sally come out to the Coast , where , changing her name to Boots Molloy , she joined Lenny and Honey at a really raunchy strip bar in Los Angeles called Duffy 's . Duffy 's was the making of Lenny Bruce the comic ? and Lenny Bruce the junkie . " Everything he ever did came out of burlesque , " Sally says , recalling Lenny 's first breakthroughs ; " and what burlesque ! A bunch of schlocky broads , the lowest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bust-out joint . " If the boss , Rocky , did n't like a customer , he would piss in his glass and then cover it with a little beer . Fights with crashing glasses and collapsing furniture were common occurences ; Rocky would say , " All right , you 're through for the night . Take that bunch of fag musicians and get the hell out of here ! " A regular Serge Diaghilev ! The boys in the band were not " a bunch of fags , " but they were mocking , cynical hipsters who lived " wild . " Lenny was fascinated by them . He was like the new boy in a tough neighborhood ; he soon found what tickled the gang and he gave it to them in every show . He delivered his lines into the house , but they were intended to register behind his back . The big duel was between himself and those " schlocky broads , " the strippers . He was always making fun of them , putting them on in every key . One night he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage . The girl went through her long , teasing , tantalizing  | routine , the whole big production involved in merely getting undressed . Just as she finished , Lenny came walking out on the stage ? stripped down to the raw ? clapping his hands mechanically and chanting , " Come on folks , let 's give the little girl a big hand . " It was the first of a series of kamikaze attacks on show-biz shams . The boys in the band were so delighted with the new banana that they turned him on to hard drugs . Lenny passed the habit on to Honey , and their relationship began to deteriorate . Eventually , they were divorced and their child was reared by Sally . But Honey was part of Lenny 's life till the day he died . He went through an enormous number of women , but he was never again in love . Lenny 's confrontations with the law were generally presented as David-and-Goliath conflicts ; actually , it was more like caveman and computer . Lenny 's mind had a primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but absolutely incompatible wih the abstrusities of the law . I never left Lenny 's room without receiving instructions for legal research ; " Uncle Al " ( he would always do the baby bit when he wanted something ) " go in the big library and look up Section 1121-a , little a " ? and he would carefully write the numbers in the air with his finger . Spelling and legal jargon were obstacles even more formidable than the juristic formulas they encased . I remember looking with shocked disbelief at the first page of his appeal from the New York conviction ; a year of hard work had gone into this document , but there in the first sentence was a glaring misspelling , " in fawner forma pauperis . " Lenny had tried to play the Latin by ear and missed ? just as he often did with his secondhand Yiddish . Despite all these obstacles , there is no question that by the end of his life Lenny Bruce had mastered all the legal aspects of his cases and moved out beyond the confines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its guarantees of free speech and action . A West  | Coast journalist who specializes in legal subjects told me that he witnessed a fascinating discussion between Bruce and a friendly judge in San Francisco that left the magistrate shaking his head in amazement at Lenny 's knowledge of the law . When the writer told Lenny that there was only one other man in the entire United States who knew more about the First Amendment , Lenny snapped , " You mean Justice Black . I 'm going to see him next . " Lenny always said that he wanted " a bigger life " than the clubs offered , and the law with its theatricalism , its impressive ritual and liturgy , the endless opportunities it offers for fast thinking and analogical imagination became the theater of his dreams . He was almost sure that he would end by playing the Supreme Court . But he would have settled for a lower court . He had a fantasy about how his New York trial would conclude . He would become his own attorney ( he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , witty and learned summation , Judge Murtagh would turn to the jury and say : " Are you kidding ? Arrest a man for this sort of thing ? " Then , like Barry Fitzgerald in some old M-G-M movie , Murtagh would put his arm around Lenny and they would walk out of the court room forever ? maybe to go fishing . As the years wore on and Lenny 's position became increasingly desperate , his anger began to build and he meditated more and more outrageous forms of legal action . He advised Ralph Ginzburg to sue the Supreme Court , just as Lenny had tried to sue the three judges who had convicted him in New York . His last great plan was to mount a spring offensive against the governors of five states ? California , Illinois , New York , Nevada and Florida ? launched from the courts of some Southern state to highlight the civil-liberties aspect of the case . Had he had the money , there is no question that Lenny Bruce would have initiated some extraordinary legal maneuvers to dramatize his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a magic weapon which , when properly wielded , would right any wrong . The law was his silver bullet .  | Apart from the ambitions and needs that prompted his legal obsession , Lenny was motivated by a touching love of print and the paraphernalia of learning . He was childishly delighted by Magic Markers , staple machines and clipboards . The sight of a stack of fresh Xerox copies would make his day . Laboring over law books like some young student , he would rise early every morning and work until night in his " office , " reversing the habits of a lifetime . In the last months of his life , he learned to type , and this simple skill so delighted him that he could not be enticed away from the machine . His last words were a legal formula tapped out on a typewriter . Behind all this enthusiasm was the satisfaction of learning a real discipline . Lenny had conquered life with his fantasies , but he never believed in the victory . The development of one skill testified to the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can master the law , " he would say , " I can learn Latin and Greek . " I knew what was behind Lenny 's thinking . If you were brought up by an adoring mother who was more like a playmate than a parent , a mother who did not want to distress you by imposing real discipline and who could not disguise her amusement at your groping efforts at self-sufficiency , you might well develop in later years a damaging pattern of dependence on all sorts of people , coupled with a profound yearning for autonomy . Lenny 's childlike undisciplined temperament was at the root of everything that was splendid , and appalling , in his life . It gave him the charm to win audiences , the self-indulgent freedom to explore every corner of his mind and to play all sorts of amusing and delightful pranks . At the same time , it left him feeling that he was swimming around in a world without shape ; it set him off on a lifelong quest for limits , for restraints , for a solid line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrain him , he had to seek control elsewhere ; he found it eventually by coming into collision with the police , the courts and the law . The conflict was painful but no one who watched Bruce  | through his ordeal would ever believe that his arrests and trials were experienced without a peculiar sense of gratification . An arrest would stimulate him to wild flights of humor . When he was seized with narcotics in his possession in Los Angeles , his behavior astonished the police and the reporters . Faced with a charge that could put him away for ten years , Bruce could not stop joking . Asked where he had been arrested , he quipped , " At Lawrence Welk 's pad . " Reporter : " What 's narcotics like ? " Bruce : " It 's a weird , dizzy , crazy scene " ( giving big twitch ) . Judge : " Do you have any final utterance before you 're put in a cell ? " Bruce : " I just hope my mother does n't hear about this . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply exhilarated . Many people believed that Lenny Bruce harbored a death wish and was actively working to bring about his own destruction . They pointed to the incredible accidents he suffered ? like falling out of the window of a San Francisco hotel . Perhaps they were right . The problem was very deepy connected with Lenny 's drug addiction , which had produced most of the serious trouble in his life . Drugs had broken up his marriage , drugs had undermined his health , and it was drugs and the crazy , malicious people that he met in the junkie world that sent him flying out that hotel window . The story comes in several versions : but essentially it boils down to a typically irresponsible hippie girl who thought it would be great fun to see the fascinating Lenny Bruce out of his skull on LSD . She slipped the drug into his coffee , and soon Lenny began to feel strange sensations . His answer to any problem in his head was to take a shot ; so he set to work and tried to inject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soluble and Lenny , clumsy as always with a needle , could not find a vein . Finally , an old friend came into the room and jammed the needle into his shoulder . What happened after that is not clear ; in any case , he went out the window and fell two stories fracturing his legs and pelvis . In the hospital his arm became gangrenous , and  | he came close to losing it . Among the members of the New York underground , it is still widely believed that the police taped Lenny 's mouth shut to stop him from uttering obscenities after the accident , and that he was unable to complain of the pain in his arm ? produced by glass splinters ? until the infection was far advanced . One summer , when I was visiting on the West Coast , I heard similar stories about Lenny 's death . The rumors were fed by the fact that an autopsy had been performed and the results never released . Everybody had a different story : suicide , overdose , heart failure . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The saddest story came from Lenny 's mother . Sally had wanted to run to Lenny 's side the moment she heard the news of his death , but her friends dissuaded her , saying , " Is that the way you want to remember him ? " A year passed before she went to the morgue to claim the clothes he had been wearing when he died . As the attendant handed her the bundle , she reached out with both hands and suddenly remembered another scene from forty years before : a nurse putting into her hands a little yellow-faced baby wrapped in a blue blanket . New York , 1968  | MARCEL MARCEAU , the famous French mime , may have never heard a sick joke nor read a page of black humor , but he has danced the difficult truth of these ambiguous phenomena in his parable of the man and the mask . A little man playfully dons a comic mask . After cavorting about exhilarated by his disguise , he grows tired of the novelty and tries to remove the mask . Horrified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed to his face . A terrible struggle follows ; his body writhes in agony while his face remains frozen in a grin . At last the false face is wrenched off , but the real face behind it is now simply a blank . Marceau 's clown could stand not only for the ubiquitous comic entertainers of our time but even more appropriately for the audience that increasingly has adopted sick , or black , humor as an important part of its own life style . The strident , caustic chatter of the sick comic is no longer confined to the little clubs , the downtown lofts and pads , the haunts of the underground . Now every neighborhood movie house , every suburban cocktail party , every college dormitory  | and child 's bedroom strewn with copies of Mad ? rattles with the yelping laughter of people whose tightly leashed anxieties and resentments are permitted to bark only on a comic cue . The sick style is probably the most frequently adopted social disguise of our day : it provides a badge of sophistication , a smoke screen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hostility , a Masonic handclasp of belonging and a palliative for prurience . Ultimately , it can become a blind compulsion to fling every disturbing experience or emotion into the comic trash can . So common today is the use of humor as character armor that psychiatrists at Yale have already responded to it by inventing a new therapeutic technique called " banter . " Instead of the traditional medical earnestness and sympathy , the therapist adopts a joshing attitude toward his patient and then analyzes the wisecracks that come flying back . The strategy should have wide applicability . Millions of people are now squirming behind masks with mirthless grins that conceal the blankness of personalities inadequate to openly express or withstand the angry energies of the " cool " world . Paradoxically , these masks are the very same that once afforded a great sense of liberation . For when sick humor erupted in the early Fifties , it came as a catharsis of the anger , fear and rebelliousness brought to a boil during the McCarthy era . No mere fad , the new humor revealed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purge the soul of perilous emotion . There were other sources : the atmosphere had been charged with comic potential by the surrealistic shapes of contemporary reality and by a widespread loss of emotional involvement with this reality . Once the subtle web of affects that binds us to life has been torn , everything looks slightly ridiculous . But ultimately it was hate ? for the sick self as well as the sick world ? that sent the satiric spark crackling across the gap of alienation . We ought to ponder an equation , one that in time may become as decisive and as threatening as Einstein 's famous atomic fission formula in postulating the likelihood of a dis-  | astrous explosion . In our society , as incitements to anger increase , the socially endorsed means for expressing this anger diminish . This begets another vicious cycle , for no one is less tolerant of hostility than those who have barely repressed their own rage . The final irony is that psychoanalysis , which has provided this diagnosis , has inevitably aggravated the condition by sensitizing us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , we are compelled to adopt devious stratagems in order to express anger and yet escape punishment . Sick comedy , for a time , served us well as just such a dodge . Then , several years ago ? when the sicks seemed to be dying ? a remarkable thing happened . At what were once considered the opposite ends of the cultural scale , first in fiction , then in film , sick comedy was reborn in a shape far more bizarre than anything seen in its first appearance . The treatment of war in a whole series of productions from Catch-22 to Dr. Strangelove and the satire on sex from Naked Lunch to Candy made the old routines of Lenny Bruce seem as quaint as Jiggs and Maggie . But despite the enormity of the license assumed by some of these satires , the effects they produced were surprisingly weak . For true to the typical pattern of any novelty in American culture , the new humor has been overworked and underdeveloped , recklessly transformed in a few years from vision to dejd vu . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the sick comic sweated and suffered and finally screamed forth the " unspeakable , " the new slick sicks violate taboos with the lobotomized glee of Mickey Mouse . And where once there was the continual shock of surprise as one sacred cow after another fell over , impaled by a shaft of wit , now the satire has degenerated into the ritual slaughter of dead horses . Often the satirical intention is merely a specious cover for infantile sexual aggression and exhibitionism . Sick humor , in short , has turned into camp . Consequently , instead of providing that longed-for catharsis that was its original boon , it has become a soft , cheap substitute ,  | both for immediacy and candor in personal relationships , and for freedom and integrity of imagination in the arts . Sick humor , like Marceau 's mask , has become a comic prison . But , even with its targets gutted wrecks like Mother and the White Liberal , its weapons rusty devices from the Fifties , and its ammunition pasteboard bombs that explode like party favors , sick comedy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every week the book page of the Times shouts forth the good news of the latest comic apocalypse , juggling its shrill adjectives like a 4znd Street movie marquee ? " daring , " " hilarious , " " outrageous . " This echo of Broadway ballyhoo is no accident , for the novel is fast becoming a branch of show business with its writers located in Hollywood , its favorite technique the parody of an old film , and its vision of life on a par with an animated cartoon . Listen to this spiel : There must be something more , this ca n't be all there is to life ! So reasons undergraduate basketball star Hector Bloom , who thereupon sets out to seek a pattern for the world in which he finds himself ( a few years in the future ) . Militant espousal of non-conformism , " radical " thought , revolutionists , a mad race against death at a hundred-miles-an-hour down a parkway , love with a professor 's wife , Zen , marijuana , sex , a stupendous extravaganza of a party at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basketball court , strong protests against war ? all these enter into Rector 's search . Underlying this vigorous , controversial , mocking , fantastical , violent yet withal humorous satire , there is a solid foundation of truth and honesty . . . . Sounding like something one would read off a billboard in Times Square , this copy is from the jacket of Jeremy Larner 's Drive , He Said , a book that was awarded the $10,000  | Delta Prize by a jury of eminent American writers and critics ( Mary McCarthy , Walter van Tilburg Clark and Leslie Fiedler ) . The puff itself appears to be an incredible instance of commercial gaucherie , but the novel it pitches for matches the sensationalism of the blurb . Larner 's theme is a farrago of the frustrations , failures , grievances and gripes of the current generation . With patience , craft and penetration , he might have converted his catalogue of post-adolescent thrills and chills into a novel ; but being an impatient improvisist , he surrenders to the mode and riddles off his stuff with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sahl , keeping his audience off balance and his own guard up high . Jazzing his jerky narrative with lurid gangster-film horrors , hooking his reader into the next chapter with the cliff-hanging suspense gimmicks of the pulp writer ? while always reaching for the never-fail Jewish gag ? Larner runs on like a dying comic , too scared to wait for the laugh . What is so disappointing about this kind of performance is that one knows that behind its trite grotesqueries there is most likely a sensitive suffering soul . But to articulate imaginatively his most profound feelings and ideas , he has to whip himself into an opening-night fever and flatten his thought to the Stone Age scratchings of the funny papers . Perhaps the moral is that the tawdry fantasy life of America does not permit the artist to attack it in any but its own sterile terms . There are alternatives , however , to the crudely reductive satire that has inundated us recently . One possibility is to train our attention on the sick comic himself , not treating him after his own fashion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character instead of a mere target . A modestly successful achievement of this sort is The Sterile Cuckoo by John Nichols . Embarrassingly square at first sight for its evocation , through half-amused , halfboastful reminiscence , of frat-house drinking revels , redolent of Dartmouth Winter Carnival ? at second glance , Nichols ' book takes on a deeper dimension . With astuteness  | and unfailing intuition , the young author has placed at the heart of his college recollections an absolutely unique yet broadly representative character named Pookic Adams . A comedienne , who has adopted the new humor as her personal life style , Pookie is the type of today 's funny little old college girl . The essential Pookie is engagingly depicted at the long overdue consummation of her first " affair . " Having reeled in the narrator from miles below the surface of sexual maturity ( when they met he was absorbed in studying beetle copulation ) , she is faced with the problem of easing him off the hook . After driving through a terrible blizzard in a fabulously dilapidated jalopy , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cold as a cabin in the Klondike . To help the boy , who is numb with anxiety , alternately freezing and sweating on the brink of his first complete sexual experience , Pookie starts to work the room like a stand-up comic . Her fist a make-believe mike , she does an on-the-spot broadcast from The Kozy Kabins , conjuring away with laughter the lumpy bed , the embarrassment of the visits to the john , the getting undressed " bit . " And after urging her lover to peel off her sweater and skirt , and maneuver the inevitably troublesome brassiere fastener , she offers him his long-desired sight of the promised land , turning around and around like a mechanical doll in her glasses and her loafers , keeping up a stream of self-disparaging wisecracks . Although Pookie often appears a fragile , childlike moppet encased in a gauzy pink cocoon of Disneyland fantasy ( she writes a poem to the " Lavender Grella , " and discourses on a whimsical creature called the " Long-Billed Sneet " ) , her actions and daydreams suggest pathological hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neurotic with a classic case history . Cut off from her classmates by a bad heart , remote from her parents for whom she has no respect , Pookic spent her childhood concocting fantasies of revenge , acted out with frogs , spiders and other little creatures . Unconsciously associating " real feeling " with violence , she is compelled to destroy things with ruthless vigor , starting with herself .  | From one end of the book to the other , she is injured in a series of " accidents " that seem to pursue her with malignant fatality . In her eagerness to retrieve the body of a crow she has just shot for the fun of it , she lacerates her feet by running across broken glass remaining from target practice . Hurtling off the train to give her boy friend the hug she has been rehearsing for weeks , she knocks him to the ground in a fall that splits his skull . Some of the fantasies into which she escapes are masked by deliberate nonsense , but there is no mistaking the meaning of her favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day with a machine gun and let everybody have it . She liked the idea of herself , skirt uplifted daintily , stepping over a rug of bloody bodies burping occasionally , sending honey-colored bubblish souls up toward the smoky ceiling . " Spunky as her efforts are to exorcise fear with farce , their ultimate effect is to make her a " sterile cuckoo , " cut off from life by the comic persona she originally adopted to protect her deeply damaged personality . Pookie Adams is an emblem of the extreme precariousness of the comic adjustment as a means of survival , and the utter insufficiency , indeed severely thwarting effect , of this strategy the minute we reach for the genuine intimacy of friendship or marriage . Granting that people have always used humor to dispel tension , to conceal embarrassment and to win sympathetic attention , still it seems clear that the intensity , ubiquity and automatism of humor in contemporary American life goes far beyond anything known from history . As sick comedy has established itself as our accustomed way of seeing things , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result that whatever was not ridiculous in our world is now being made so by this uncontrollable mental tic . What an ironic and devastating criticism is implied by this single fact ? that in ducking behind the comic mask , we actually believe we are boldly facing reality . The Nation , 1965  | Shaking Hands with Philip Roth THE PUBLICATION of a book is not often a major event in America . Most of our classics , when they first appeared , met with disappointing receptions , and even the muchballyhooed best-sellers of recent years have rarely cut a great swath outside the lanes of publicity and journalism . But this year a real literary-cultural event portends , and every shepherd of public opinion , every magus of criticism , is wending his way toward its site . Gathered at an old New York City inn called Random House , at the stroke of midnight on the iIst of February in this 5,729th year since the creation of the world , they will hail the birth of a new American hero , Alexander Portnoy . A savior and scapegoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of thirty-three to take upon himself all the sins of sexually obsessed modern man and expiate them in a tragicomic crucifixion . The gospel that records the passion of this mock messiah is a slender , psychotic novel by Philip Roth called Portnoy 's Complaint ( the title is a triple pun signifying that the hero is a whiner , a lover and a sick man ) . So great is the  | fame of the book even before its publication that it is being hailed as the book of the present decade and as an American masterwork in the tradition of Huckleberry Finn . Heralded last year by several stunning excerpts in the serious literary magazines , Portnoy comes to us glowing not merely as a succes d'estime but as a succes de scandale ? the scandal fuming up from the book 's pungent language , a veritable attar of American obscenity ; and from its preoccupations , foremost among which is the terrible sin of onanism . Presently the object of a cult , which passes selections from the sacred writing from hand to hand at sophisticated dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , Portnoy today is still an underground password . But the complete work is being readied for distribution by an international ring of literary agents who are cutting , packaging and peddling it like a deck of pure heroin . Soon it will be injected into every vein of contemporary culture : as hardcover book , as soft-cover booklet , as book club offering , as foreign translation and as American movie . The TV rights remain as yet unsold , but even without them the book has already earned almost a million dollars prior to the first press run . A million dollars in publicity is what the book will earn next . A chain reaction of cover stories and profiles and critiques and put-ons and put-downs and pictures and cartoons and slogans and quips has already begun to build toward a blast that may set a new record for publicity overkill . The book that is being blown up by all of this puffing is not so much volatile as it is intense , probing , incisive . A diagnostic novel by a comic Freud , it focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contemporary American life ? all sick , black and blue . The hero , an Assistant Commissioner of Human Opportunity for the City of New York , is a man who exemplifies the cherished values of the Kennedy years . Brilliant and precocious as a student , successful as a lawyer , dedicated and sensitive as a public servant to the underprivileged , Alexander Portnoy has de-  | voted his whole life to being good . Yet when we discover this nicest of Nice Jewish Boys , he is lying on his back on a psychoanalyst 's sofa , like an overturned cockroach , spewing out a frenzied stream of angry , resentful and self-defensive words . Honking through his beaky nose a heavy Jewish blues , he reels off an endless chronicle of suffering , degradation and terror , interspersed now and then with little grace notes of pleasure . Though Alexander Portnoy 's complaint is directed in the first instance against his smothering and seductive mother , and in the second against the succession of maddening females who have poisoned his life , the ultimate truth of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same way that Oedipus fell victim to fate . For struggle as he will , and analyze as best he can , Portnoy can not escape the appalling fact that in the Sixties Americans are seeking to live by two completely contradictory moral codes . Maintaining their allegiance to the traditional morality of monogamy , fidelity , self-sacrifice and the sublimation of sexual energies , Americans are almost equally sanctimonious about those " needs " and " rights " that include the license to experiment with every sort of sexual and sensuous behavior dictated by the most primitive instincts and passions . Walking about in a fallen world , with these two Edens warring in their heads , modern Americans are made borderline schizophrenics . Something of this sense of the Doppelganger that stalks us has been suggested in a great many works of contemporary literature and comedy . Indeed , the farcical gap between what all Americans are supposed to be and what they are has been the mainstay of our humor ever since this American dilemma found expression in the wit of the so-called " sick " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nichols &; May were the first to exploit the awkward , spraddling moral stance of the new American ; after them the comedy of the Yankee schlemiel was developed much further by a whole succession of Jewish novelists , including  | Saul Bellow , Joseph Heller , Wallace Markfield and Bruce Jay Friedman . For more than a decade these comic artists cultivated the themes and techniques brought to final fruition in Portnoy . For it has always been evident that , though this profound conflict between our better and worse selves might tear us apart , drive us to despair or make us crazy , it could never be treated with complete seriousness or with the literal-minded simplicity of the sexologists and the public moralists . Comedy alone could provide the lens through which this strangely embarrassing American predicament could be examined . Philip Roth 's achievement in Portnoy , therefore , is not the discovery of a theme nor the invention of a mode , but the final perfection of an art , the comic art of this Jewish decade . Purging the Jewish joke and comic novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family myth more profoundly than any of his predecessors , shining his light into all its corners and realizing its ultimate potentiality as an archetype of contemporary life . Portnoy 's Complaint boldly transcends ethnic categories . Focusing its image of man through the purest and craziest of stereotypes , the book achieves a vision that , paradoxically , is sane , whole and profound . As intimate as the mirror on the bathroom wall , it affords its readers glimpse after glimpse of themselves nakedly living the truths and lies of their innermost lives . Looking into this mirror , the reader ? Jew or Gentile ? will be caught between old shame and new pride , between the instinct to cover up and the urge to bare all . Torn , yet relieved by successive shocks of recognition , he will murmur the healing formula of self-acceptance . " It is I. " So intense is the conflict between the two sides of Alexander Portnoy 's fractured psyche , so classically clear is his syndrome , that he has been accorded by his psychoanalyst the signal honor of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own name : " Portnoy 's Complaint ? A disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic im-  | pulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings , often of a perverse nature . . . . Acts of exhibitionism , voyeurism , fetishism , autoeroticism and oral coitus are plentiful ; as a consequence of the patient 's morality , ' however , neither fantasy nor act issues in genuine sexual gratification , but rather in overriding feelings of shame and the dread of retribution , particularly in the form of castration . " Portnoy 's personality derangement derives , of course , from his childhood relationship with his Jewish mother . Alternately rocked in the soothing seas of maternal solicitude and swamped by the terrifying tides of maternal domination , the boy grows up pathetically seeking some one thing he can call his own . Not until puberty does he discover what he is seeking . Masturbation offers him the thrill of a secret , rebellious and wholly self-indulgent life . Behind a locked bathroom door , his head thronging with erotic images , his ear alert for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are you doing inside there ? " ? Portnoy comes to identify sex with feelings of anxiety and remorse . But the power of his secret pleasure propels him out into the world in search of the beautiful , responsive creatures of his fantasies . Gentile girls with silky hair , button noses and long slender legs are what he seeks : little beauties redolent of the perfume of America , the alien land that must be plowed to be possessed . Questing like a nervous knight-errant in search of an erotic grail , he must pass through many encounters , many trying adventures , before he discovers the embodiment of his dreams standing at midnight on the corner of 52nd Street and Lexington Avenue . Springing off the highboard of life-as-fantasy with this girl , who is so lecherous and ignorant that he calls her " The Monkey , " Portnoy tumbles head over heels in the most extravagant of all erotic , romantic , neurotic relationships . Their dreamlike fall into the depths of sexual debauchery is at first thrilling ? in this respect paralleling the stolen pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | mand something more of each other than exchanges of erotic goodies , and the relationship splinters into angry words and exacerbated feelings . Finally , after having inveigled his mistress into a scene of climactic licentiousness , our hero abandons her as a crazy person who menaces his life and happiness . Leaving the hysterical Monkey standing on the window sill of their hotel room in Athens , threatening to dash herself to death on the pavement below , Portnoy flees to Israel , where he meets a lady kibbutznik , a rugged , self-righteous amazon who reminds him of his mother . Attempting a crude physical seduction , he finds himself impotent . When he offers the lady an alternate form of gratification , she becomes enraged at his degeneracy and kicks him in the heart . Ending his sexual odyssey much where he began it , sprawling prostrate and helpless at the feet of a greatly desired but inaccessible woman , Portnoy concludes his long complaint with a protracted scream of pain . Portnoy is not only a funny but an impassioned and angry book . Unlike every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hurting him ? and it is n't the goyim . He delivers his most soul-gratifying thrusts at those sentimentalized objects of mindless piety , the Jewish mamma and papa , the emasculators of generations of Jewish men . Yet his anger is crossed by love for its targets , and is distinguished even further by an " Arise Ye Brothers of ? " ardor , a rhapsodic sympathy for his fellow sufferers that bursts forth in passages of ironic eloquence . The crown of the book is his vision of a Jewish Ship of Fools , a boatload of Nice Jewish Boys rolling on the seas of guilt : " I am on the biggest troop ship afloat . . . only look in through the portholes and see us there , stacked to the bulkheads in our bunks , moaning and groaning with such pity for ourselves , the sad and watery-eyed sons of Jewish parents , sick to the gills from rolling through these heavy seas of guilt ? so I sometimes envision us , me and my fellow wailers , melancholics and wise guys , still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sick as dogs , we cry out intermittently , one of us or another , Poppa , how could you ? ' Momma , why did you ? ' . . . the retching in the toilets after meals , the hysterical deathbed laughter from the bunks , and the tears ? here a puddle wept in contrition , here a puddle from indignation ? in the blinking of an eye , the body of a man ( with the brain of a boy ) rises in impotent rage to flail at the mattress above , only to fall instantly hack , lashing itself with reproaches . Oh , my Jewish men friends ! My dirty-mouthed guilt-ridden brethren ! My sweethearts ! My mates ! Will this . . . ship ever stop pitching ? When ? When , so that we can leave off complaining how sick we are ? and go out into the air , and live ! " For many readers the strangest feature of Portnoy will be the fact that its author is the same man who wrote Letting Go and When She Was Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills but in no wise prepare one for the high jinks of this latest work ( though these high jinks do in fact mirror closely the style and wit I and other friends of Roth have enjoyed for years in private conversations and at parties ) . Indeed , since 196o , when at the remarkably early age of twenty-seven he won the National Book Award for fiction with his first work , Goodbye , Columbus , Philip Roth has given every indication of desiring to be counted among the handful of recent authors more concerned with the values of traditional literature than they are with the currents of contemporary writing . Educated at Bucknell and the University of Chicago , active for many years as a teacher of English literature and creative writing at Chicago , Princeton and Iowa , a familiar figure on the college lecture platform and even behind the lectern of the synagogue , a contributor to Commentary and Partisan Review , Roth has clung through his whole career to the skirts of the university and has counted himself a member of the intellectual and cultural elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early work appealed . With Goodbye , Columbus , a collection of canny , morally  | sophisticated stories written in a scrupulously impersonal style ? the antithesis of the verbal extravagance of Portnoy ? Roth focused fiercely on the life of middle-class America in the postwar years , particularly in the American Jewish community , where all the traditional values were being submerged in the scuffle to obtain the good things of material prosperity . This volume was followed in 1962 by Letting Go , a long and thoughtful novel in which Roth articulated his moral obsession , the theme which underlies all his subsequent writing : the effort of the self to break the bondage of narcissism by renouncing all selfish gratification in favor of a self-sacrificing dedication to the happiness of others . This Christian theme he treated , of course , with a great deal of irony , steadily increasing the dosage , until in Portnoy the theme is totally inverted and the hero struggles , with the reader 's covert approval , to cast off all traces of moralism and lead a life of guiltless self-gratification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , When She Was Good , that I first met Philip Roth . Whether it was owing to some congeniality of temperaments or simply to the fact that he knew I had spent a great many years running with a pack of Jewish comics that included the late Lenny Bruce , our encounters soon assumed the form of spontaneous staging sessions with Roth out in the spotlight working the room like a stand-up comic . Typically we would meet by chance at Mayhew 's , a little breakfast shop in Manhattan 's East Sixties . I 'd be sitting there enjoying the peace of the morning hour and the soothing influence of an egg and butter , when my mood would be shattered by a reproachful voice : " Albert , your father and I have been worried sick about you ! " Looking up I would see , not my Jewish mother magically transported from Santa Monica to New York , but Philip Roth , glaring at me maniacally . Looking nothing like the picture on the jackets of his books ? that beautiful fem-man face , with its cleft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mesmer-eyes ? this was the comic-crazy Roth , the one lost soul on the pilgrimage , a  | jarring presence sending out hysterical waves in every direction . Slipping into the chair next to mine , fixing me with a hooded maternal gaze , he would continue his exhortation in that guilt-inducing , **42;1779;TOOLONG voice : " Two weeks and not a word . How is it a writer , a person who sits all day behind a typewriter , ca n't put two words together to send to a mother who lives three thousand miles away ? " Then a hyena laugh , fracturing that sorrowful maternal stare into the crazy lights and angles of a Cubist portrait . I 'd be gagging , choking , caught between laughter at Philip and anger at my mother , wondering meanwhile ( with an instinct as old as the race ) what the goyim were thinking ? particularly that thick-lensed cashier , who has stopped toting up his bills and is staring with astonishment at this strident newcomer . By this time Philip would be too wound up to notice or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the Jewish Genet who has written this play called The Terrace in which there 's a brothel for Nice Jewish Boys where you go every night and they dress you in Dr. Denton 's kiddie pajamas and they bathe you and powder you and put mineral oil where it itches . Tucked into your bed , you fall asleep blissfully listening to a little radio with an orange dial . Next morning a voice calls softly , " Wake up , dear , it 's time to get up . " For that , Philip says , he 'd gladly pay $50 a night . Now the magic word " radio " triggers him into his " Blue Network " bit . " J-E-L-L-o ! " He 's doing all the voices from the Jack Benny show : smoothie Jack , fruity Dennis . Yes , yes , I remember them perfectly ! But wait , he 's reaching even further back for ? wow ! ? Mr. Kitzel ! Now he 's sliding his voice way up in the air in an oral shrug , a vocal curlicue : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Schlepperman ! " Awesome , Philip , awesome . " After fifteen or twenty minutes of this comic fuguing , the waiters would be throwing Philip looks , Wall Street Journals would be dropping and some old lady would be giving  | him the top lens . Everybody would be asking himself , " Who the hell is this guy ? He must be some famous Jewish nightclub comedian who has n't gotten to bed yet . Wow ! He 's really up there . Nine o'clock in the morning and still flying . " After all my years with the funny men , my response to Philip 's antics was partly professional . I recognized in him a type not of the stage but of the Jewish living room , the candy store or luncheonette , where after school the kids take turns driving each other over the edge into hysteria . He agreed that he had learned to be funny when he was a child , probably on those daily walks from Chancellor Avenue grade school in the Weequahic section of Newark to the little Hebrew school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , those highly regimented Jewish kids could blow off steam and subject the pyramided pieties of their world to a healthy dose of desecratory humor . For a few minutes they could afford to be bad . Being bad and being funny were much the same thing in Roth 's mind , and I often had the feeling that when he wrote his fiction he was intent upon being very good . Having as one of my own obsessions the ideal of a Jewish comic who would be an artist and not just a theatrical or literary entertainer , I often urged Roth to exploit his comic gifts in fiction . I told him that his role was to be the comic messiah , the redeemer of the Jewish joke . When I pressed my arguments and exhorted him to write a novel that would match his hidden talents , a book that would be black , sick , surreal , Kafkaesque , unabashedly vulgar , obscene and Jewish , he would say with a sigh , " Oh , Al . " In those days , When She Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for years and rewritten it something like eight times . In his apartment were four big cartons stuffed with manuscript . After so many years of close-up work , he could n't tell any longer what he was doing ; so one day he packed the latest draft into his briefcase and left his rackety apartment for the calm of the 42nd  | Street Library 's reading room . There he read enough of what he had written to realize that , despite the enormous pains he had lavished on the book , it was still so defective that he could not think of publishing it . Walking out into Bryant Park with its pigeons and hobos , he contemplated the future . No longer was he a writer , he decided , nor would he trade off his literary reputation by taking a succession of teaching jobs . At thirty-three he was young enough to go into something else . What would it be ? Well , he could always go up to Harlem and be a playground director and die . Instead , he went off to Yaddo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a work retreat for writers , artists and composers . ( Roth 's deep attachment to Yaddo owes something to the beauty of the place ? it is set among lakes and woods , with a view of the distant Vermont mountains ? but it is really its character as a sanctuary from city life , and more especially its comfort as a surrogate home , a home without the annoyance of a family , that explains his frequent and prolonged visits there . ) Regulating his life for as much as six months at a time by the soothing routine of the place ? they get you up early , feed you breakfast and pack you off to work in a little cabin with a lunch box full of cold chicken and a shiny apple ? he was finally able to bring When She Was Good into order and to publish it in 1967 . A stylistic tour de force , When She Was Good turns the tone of One Man 's Family back on itself to produce a highly ambiguous literary texture whose irony is as subtle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tension of the book is generated by counterpointing the most gracious of all pop American tones against the moral frenzy and insanity of the heroine , a Midwestern Medea who embodies the horror of the Protestant ethic run amok . Expecting high praise ? at least from the more sophisticated critics ? Roth was dismayed to find the reviewers yawning over his novel and offering consoling phrases while they waited for his next book . Perhaps When She Was  | Good was too subtle for those who sat down to write about it . In any case , as soon as Roth had finished it his mind righted itself and all the baffled energies that had blown this way and that during five years of mental doldrums now became a steady breeze which soon shaped itself into a voice ? a voice rising and falling with the complaining intonations of an angry and neurotic Jewish boy . For two years I had seen so little of Philip Roth that when I dialed his number last summer I was n't even sure whether he was still living in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Complaint in New American Review , I had to toss in my penny 's worth of praise . Always glad to hear from an old playmate , Philip invited me to his home in one of New York 's tallest and baldest buildings . As I walked into his apartment on the twenty-first floor , a flat lined with brown metal bookcases like the stacks of a library , he greeted me with a routine , singing in the strident voice of a Broadway musical comedy star , " New York , New York , it 's a wonderful town ! " and gesticulating toward the huge plate-glass windows of the room . Holding a high note , he drew the blind to reveal a stunning panorama of city skyline . Stepping offstage , he slumped into an armchair and began to talk . Immediately , I caught a new note in his voice , a lilting note of optimism . " Wow , what a year I 've had ! " He reels off an incredible yarn . It starts with his going to a publication party for William Styron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweeds , nibbling on an hors d'oeuvre , Philip begins to feel this pulsing pang in his right side . He 'd had the same pain months before and figured he 'd licked it , but now it grows worse and worse . The doctors ca n't tell what it is , so they put him in the hospital and his fever goes up and up , and finally , this crazy scene : a big , handsome surgeon dressed for a black-tie party is pressing down on his abdomen and Philip is going through the ceiling . Appendicitis is the diagnosis and immediate operation the plan , but when they cut  | him open they find that the cap blew off his gut days before and his belly is flooded with pus . They stick tubes into him from top to bottom and for days he wallows in delirium . Every time he comes out of it , he finds this exquisite woman , the woman he 's been seeing almost every day for three years , standing at the foot of the bed wearing these strange sacklike dresses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go home and put a short skirt on . You look like you 're dressed for my funeral . " ( And indeed , as he learned later , by the time they cut into him he was just two hours ' walk from the grave ? a shocking realization that flooded him with an awed feeling of pride and elation . He had wrestled the Malekhamoves ? the angel of death ? to a fall . ) Then there is his convalescence in Florida , an idyl of sun and water , and the finishing touches on Portnoy , and the growing feeling that he has his life back under control at last , when one morning , in this same living room ? he 's up on his feet now , showing me what happened ? the phone rings and he hears his stepdaughter saying , " Mother has been killed . " His estranged wife , Maggie , being driven across Central Park at five in the morning , had been instantly killed when the car smashed into a tree . Philip is stunned . He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as he starts to pull himself together again ? wham ! ? all the hullaballoo begins about Portnoy . Fame he 's known before , but now , for the first time in his life , he has money ? and everybody is shooting zingers into him . He passes the man next door , who says , " Oh , my neighbor , the millionaire ! " But what can Philip say ? Yesterday a messenger came to his door and gave him a royalty-advance check for a quarter of a million dollars . Philip gave him a tip . What 's the tip on a quarter of a million ? " I gave him a quarter , Al . " Now he 's into this new book . He does n't know where he 's going : he has all these pieces of paper with one sentence on each page . He 's just writing this stuff and throwing it away , groping for a new theme ? some big semi-comic idea . And  | he 's haunted by this phrase , a simple little phrase : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he thinks he may write a book which will stand Kafka on his head . Sort of a marvelous idea : " Instead of having a guy who is more and more pursued and trapped and finally destroyed by his tormentors , I want to start with a guy tormented and then the opposite happens . They come to the jail and they open the door and they say to you , A terrible mistake has been made . ' And they give you your suit back , with your glasses and your wallet and your address book , and they apologize to you . And they say , Look , people from big magazines are going to come and write stories on you . And here 's some money . And we 're very sorry about this . ' " Life , 1969  | Mel Brooks Zaps the Movie Schmendricks " kY COMEDY is based on rage . I 'll show those cockamamie Cahiers critics . I 'll make a movie that 'll bend their bagels . It 'll be called Un Film de That 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . For the second shot , I 'll point the camera through the guy 's fly ? or , better , through an enlarged pore ! " Ever since he peeled off his modish Norfolk jacket and got up on his feet like a boxer , shoulders hunched , hands going , blue eyes stabbing in every direction , Mel Brooks had been his old self . Not the charming pussycat of the late-night interview shows , where he does Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly and tosses off some mildly irreverent opinions ; nor even the much grittier 2,000-Year-Old Man , who once defined tragedy as cutting his finger and comedy as watching someone fall down a manhole ? no , this was the tough , funny , smart little Jewish boy from Brooklyn who had ventriloquized for years through the mouth of television 's greatest comic , Sid Caesar . The setting was oddly perfect . The most famous of all  | parlor comics was working in a New York producer 's office that looked like it had been floated down the river from Scarsdale . Miles of spotless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a showroom ensemble of elongated damask sofa and chairs with a coffee table crouching between them like a wooden dachshund . On the facing wall was the return mileage in expensive walnut book shelves , empty except for old copies of Variety and framed B'nai B'rith awards for the Eleanor Roosevelt Story . The only thing missing was a brand new Steinway . Mel Brooks would have played it furioso . Anger is Mel 's muse . His fast mental fugues , his timing calibrated like a stop watch , his beautiful comic footwork , the skeet-shooter 's reflexes you need to nail a funny idea just as it lays its Kilroy nose over the edge of consciousness ? all that comes with anger and an undying sense of outrage . And why should n't he be sore ? Here he 'd brought his first picture , The Producers , into New York after months of successful showings and " sell " reviews all over the country , brought it home to his people ? the brighties , the smarties , the hippies . And then these schmendricks that write for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid fingers to delicately palpitant nostrils and said , " It stinks . " " Vulgar , " " crude , " " does n't know where to put the camera , " they had written . About the star they quipped , " Zero Mostel looks like a seal with a disease of the inner ear . " Well , the truth was that the picture was crammed with goodies , with things that grabbed you and made you laugh . " Ca n't they see that this is the funniest movie in years , maybe the funniest movie ever ? " Well , he would get them . His whole life had been played in double-takes . Something was always coming along that pulled your schvantzangered and obsessed you for days . Then one morning you woke up and ? hey there ! ? it was funny , funny , funny . Every little detail was crepitating with Day-Glo Disneyland FUN . Like the time Mel saw that arty cartoon by McClaren ;  | you know , one of those abstract things where the triangle meets the rhomboid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he decided to do a picture where some simple Jewish man , some old Yid with phlegm in his throat , would sit in the theater and expose this geometric hankypanky with contemptuous common sense . That was the spark for The Critic , one of the cleverest little shorts ever filmed . Now these Westchester country-club matrons and downtown cinemasturbators were asking for the same treatment , with all their gabble about the " art of film . " How many funny movies ? flat-out funny movies ? were there ? " " Strangelove ? O.K. Good picture , but too much diddling in the cockpit like some scary documentary . The Loved One ? Gorgeous book , cockamamie picture . Terry Southern ? Good comedy bones but no meat on them ? and no heart . " That was the trouble with the white bread goyim ; when they got funny , they freaked out completely , like Jonathan Winters . The Jews were n't the only funny people , but they were the ones who could laugh and still care . Look at Lenny Bruce . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he cared a lot . Lenny was a writer , a thinker , a rabbi . Mel could have gone the same route as Lenny . He could have gone on missions , too . But he and Sid could never forget that there was a world out there , a wife at home and a kid . Yet , Mel had become famous performing his own stuff on records , and he wrote himself a great part in The Producers . That 's right , he was all set to play the Nazi , Franz Liebkind . He would have done it like one of Sid 's Krauts . But at the last minute Kenny Mars asked to read for the part ; and before he was half through , Mel jumped up , ran over and shook his hand . " You 've got it ! " Kenny did a fine job , too ; but those schmegeggi reviewers could n't see it . " What is it with them ? Ca n't they give a little credit for the ideas in the picture ? " Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young accountant , Bloom . Was n't that
