The rainy season is over , and this week along the roads and trails and bicycle tracks of Northern Rhodesia , thousands of Africans are trudging through the bush to a clump of 20-odd huts called the village of Kasomo . They come from as far as 400 miles away to see and hear a plump , 32-year-old native woman and be baptized by her in the name of God-the black man 's God . Her name is Lenshina Mulenga , and her magnetic hold on the people around Kasomo is confounding Christian missionaries there . <P> One day in September 1953 , Lenshina Mulenga walked into the Church of Scotland 's Lubwa mission , about eight miles away from Kasomo . She was there , she said , because she had recently died ; she had been about to cross the river into heaven when God stopped her and told her to go back and teach her people to give up witchcraft and repent their sins . She should go to Lubwa , said the Almighty , to be taught and baptized . <P> A Strange Whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duly sent a native evangelist back to Kasomo with her , and the villagers began to flock to her hut . Soon she had another word from God . There were two books , He told her , one for whites and one for blacks , and the black book was the right one . Once again Lenshina appeared in Lubwa , this time to demand the use of the mission church to preach in . When the missionaries turned her down , she went back to her village with the story that the missionaries had stolen her African book and sent it off to Scotland . She began attacking the New Testament , calling it icibolya- " a deserted village , a hollow shell . " <P> As her fame spread , more and more pilgrims came to hear her oracular utterances and her vague version of black man 's Christianity . In the clearing behind her hut she collected them , 500 or more at a time , ordered them on pain of death to close their eyes and listen to the voice of the Almighty-a strange , whistling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening their eyes and reported that Lenshina merely stepped behind a tree and blew a whistle . <P> But the natives were more impressed than ever . When she commanded pilgrims to bring " their charms and symbols of witchcraft and leave them at shrines built for the purpose in her village , there were soon high piles of teeth , fur scraps , beads and symbolic axes for killing devils . Nervously , the Presbyterian mission sent word to the home office that a new threat to Christianity , " the Cult of Alice , " had appeared in Northern Rhodesia . <P> " When Shall We Be Saved ? " In twelve months 60,000 came to see Lenshina and be baptized . Even in the rainy season , they were coming by the hundreds . The pennies they bring her have mounted into a sizable treasury presided over by her fanatical husband Petrus , who , some say , is the power behind Lenshina . And the Presbyterian mission of Lubwa , the oldest in Northern Rhodesia , is on its last legs . <P> Last fall , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had joined Lenshina 's movement , five missionaries and a score of African evangelists visited hundreds of villages . But most of their former converts would not even listen ; out of 4,000 , only 400 agreed to desert Lenshina.
