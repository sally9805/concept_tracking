txt A week long controversial search for Chief , the lost hunting hound , was given up tonight with his owner and others agreed he is n't in the farm drainage tile where they had believed he pursued a raccoon and became trapped on Jan. 10 . About 15 men concluded the search at dark after they had spent the afternoon digging up tile on the nearby farm of Dr. Earl Ferree , retired veterinarian , who had opposed the underground search until Gov . George N. Craig posted a personal bond of $1,000 to guarantee payment for any damage . The workman shone lights thru the drainage system until they were convinced nothing I blocked the passageway . Lester Jackson of Indianapolis , owner of the 7 months old dog , then signed an agreement that he would n't dig further at the scene .
