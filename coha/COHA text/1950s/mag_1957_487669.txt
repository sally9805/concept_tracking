It was at the insistence of The Nation 's editors that Kenneth Rexroth , poet and critic by profession , volunteered for the traumatic experience hereinafter described . We felt that , whether or not his report would contribute to pure science , it would most certainly contribute to the reader 's edification  --  and amuseMent. ? THE EDITORS . San Francisco LAWRENCE LIPTON has a very funny poem called I Was A Poet for the FBI . I have never precisely been a poet for them , though I doubt not but what I have caused them sufficient annoyance . However , I now feel fame has arrived . I have been a poet for the IPAR , formerly the OS of the OSS . Things have been dull here beside Frisco Bay . There was a UNESCO conference . No story there , or rather , exactly the same story as the Industrial Development thing I just finished for The Nation see The Boys Who Rule the World , November 2 issue : the American System of world alliances is falling apart and the only answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough has n't worked , get tougher . " Things are tough all over this winter . We must tighten our belts and get our own dog up . The best thing was the show of Asian and Western art at the San Francisco Museum , which really showed a lot of fruitful cross-fertilization . It is in the world of concrete things , objects , not profits and power blocs , that the-slow and painful but absolutely essential marriage of the East and West is taking place . So mush for UNESCO . And then I got the loveliest invitation . What a pity it ca n't be quoted in full , but the gist of it was that an outfit calling itself the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research , which had started out in life as the Office of Selection of the OSS , with the job of insuring that everybody in the Army brightened the corner ' where he were , had got a bucketful of gold from the Carnegie people and had transferred from the Army to that River Rouge of the intellect , the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , which they were very busy assessing and researching , and now they had got to writers and would I please come and be assessed . " Our way of conducting research is to invite selected subjects to come to the Institute house for a period of two or three days , and there talk with members of our staff , participate in a series of experiments and psychological tests , and meet and interact with a number of other persons selected on a similar basis . " Lady Ottoline Morrel used to do the same thing , but she had to use her own money , and to judge from Aldous Huxley 's novel the interacting was more fun . Anyway  --  the novel made him famous . The IPAR n  --  e OS of OSS did n't sound like quite , such profitable literary material , but it promised to be fun enough . SO I drove over to the remodeled fraternity house that sheltered this American politisolator of di eadfully civilized vivisection , across the bridge in the sunset under the dog and the cone and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to escape from the lot of this hilariously sarcastic Russian movie I haVe been lost in for the past ten years . Everybody was so nice . I met people I knew , looking sheepish , and Jungians looking like seance addicts about to get a message from the Beyond , and clinical psychologists looking like Buick dealers , and psychiatrists fresh from the loony wards looking tired and worried , and professors looking like professors , and specialists in the creative personality ( believe me , it is possible to make a living at this specialty ) with the shy , happy , chummy look of specialists in the creative personality , and a couple of rugged sharpies who looked like they were in it for kicks , and several earnest and not very happy young women . Cocktails . How I hate them . This social obligation to stick your tongue on a third rail before dinner  --  the only universally accepted Rite of Passage of modern civilization . They had - cocktails at Yalta , cocktails at the coming out party of The Memoirs of an Escaped Nun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openings , maybe at hangings , and here we were being bucked up for our mental delousing with the things again . I had a little whiskey . It did n't make the dinner taste any worse . I began to realize I was back in America , a place I try to keep away from . The conversation was all about children and television . It sounded awfully cooked and loaded , but I put that down to everybody 's being self-conscious ? " a little paranoid , " as they say . For what it was worth , they learned that I have never seen a complete TV program , my children do n't watch it , we do n't own a set or have any friends who do . I was n't aggressive about nit , in fact it all came out politely and reluctantly . After dinner , everybody paired off for Rorschachs . I have become down the years a little fatigued with Rorschachs and my normal powers of fantasy always desert me , but I strung along  --  you ca n't win . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to do anything whatever . And then , some questionnaires and I guess then the Terman test , that tour de force of conformity . By this time everybody was weary and we called it a night . The night , at their expense , was to be spent in the Hotel Claremont . This is a curious place . It is an immense , flamboyant , wooden structure , built in Stanford White 's own " California Style " either by him or by a close disciple , and worthy of the wildest moments of Barcelona 's wonderful lunatic . It is just across the bridge from San Francisco , that notoriously cosmopolitan city , but it is , weekends , the ? hangout of Berkeley 's leading small merchants and their wives or stenographers , a more provincial lot than ever existed in Brooklyn 's innermost recesses in its most recessive days . I felt like Ed , , . . mund Wilson that time his plane was grounded in Miami and he was trapped for twenty-four hours in the Great American Mass Culture about which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance . This was it . What country was I in ? Where was my pass-port ? Suddenly I ran into the daughter of a leading libertarian intellectual , working like a dog at one of the institution 's better-dressed menialities . We were both plenty startled . What was I doing here ? When she asked , I realized the answer . I was making a fast buck allowing my head to be tooken apart by skilled representatives of precisely this world which was here tonight disporting itself in ill-fitting lame creations and Sears Roebuck tuxedos . Tonight they might buy me drinks or even dance with me . But tomorrow , off in the tortuous couloirs of a remodeled fraternity house , the billions of Mr. Carnegie and the penetrating insights of Drs . Jung and Terman were going to concentrate on my poor central nervous system , and find out why I could n't mix in with a dinner dance in Fargo , North Dakota , and what it would mean to the OS of the OSS of the onrushing ICBM War III . 0 , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a great mixer . . . But I missed my wife and kids , so I went to bed . ALL DAY NEXT day it went on I made up a picture out of little bits of color . I had a long , chummy , deep-speaking-to-deep sort of talk with the , expert on the creative personality . I indicated my preferences in Scotch tartans . I chased the elusive Gestalts through lines of bric-a-brac . I sought the still more elusive after-images of melodies like Humoresque and noises like something falling down . I sorted things and interpreted symbols . A rather frightened , puzzled , but very determined looking young woman took me in the attic , blindfolded ' me , led me into a dark room and spent twenty minutes finding out if I could tell vertical from horizontal . I could , pretty good . Cocktails in the gloaming again and then some more of that exqui-451 ? , r , ltrj site cuisine institutionale Americain , and then lots of questionnaires . One was by two Jungian ladies  --  and was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jungian ladies ever done . I would n't like to know them . They were mortifyingly shy in mixed company . They said the wrong things when out socially and then regretted them bitterly in the wee hours . They did n't like their complexions . They did n't like men . Not even Carl Jung . They were real foul-ups . You could tell from the questionnaire . Fortunately they did n't appear in the flesh . It was a most distressing questionnaire . And then the long pink questionnaires they give the kids at California U. Very appropriate for middle-aged , successful authors : " Would you like to be a fireman ? " " Do you ever doze off in class ? " " Does your family object when you stay out late ? " as well as a number of subtly loaded questions which add up to " Are you bothered much by the sin of impure touch ? " By the time I got through I had a darn good notion to just up and bite my nails . The . next day dragged on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cocktails and had a chummy little summing up and were all very polite to each other . I think the term in these cats ' jive is " shared each other 's thinking . " Oh , yeah ? WHAT DID it all mean ? Nothing . The sensory tests measured responses and faculties in ways open to subjective distortion both by the subject and the examiner . The very mild psychoanalytic probings were utterly superficial and , as far as I could judge , inspired entirely by the dubious occultism of the Swiss mahatma . Serious psychoanalysts are far too busy in clinics and hospitals trying to help the really mentally ill to bother with nonsense like this . The vertical and horizontal girl was all right . You felt she had something there and was grimly resolved to find out if it meant anything . She was testing a measurable , physical response ; it was a poor thing , but science and her own . I would have felt much better all around if my reflexes had been hammered and they 'd have found out if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly to stimuli , if my feet sweat , if I swallowed air or was subject to fits of unmotivated itching . " Do your family object if you stay out late ? " " Do you think your poems up , or do they just come to you ? " Indeed . A PUBLISHER has just issued a book wherein a similar bunch of clinical psychologists have tested in similar ways three groups : the normal ( ? ) , the neurotic ( ? ) , the psychotic ( ? ) . What did they discover after spending a lot of foundation money ? That the normal were normal , the psychotics were n't and the neurotics were nervous . Really they did , I 'm telling the truth . This unvarnished hokum with which our society intimidates itself is far less effective , far less scientific , than the varnished hokum of other days and peoples . Any Sioux medicine man , any kind and attentive priest , any properly aged grandmother , any Chinese herbalist could have found out more in a half-hour than these people did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cheaply , too . That is the point , the whole point . These capers have been going on for years . The OS of the OSS and the IPAR are only doing poets now because they are scraping the bottom of their social barrel . They 've already done just about every other category of human . This has cost many large pots of money . A foundation , no more than the government , is not really a money-bush . Once that money was somebody 's labor . As the old Socialist teachers used to say in the Rand School when I was a child , " Who are the eaters of surplus value ? " All this foundation jive is just a very fancy way of exploiting the working class . It has replaced the Radical Movement as the great source of interesting careers for the unemployable children of the middle and upper classes , just as India or the Church were for nineteenth-century England . America is full of Phi Beta Kappas in well-shined shoes who toil not , neither do they spin . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia , and the automobile factories in Detroit , and the steel mills in Pittsburgh feed them and clothe them and shelter them like the lilies of the field and the foxes of the earth . They are just another way of circumventing the falling rate of profit and about as socially useful as an intercontinental ballistic missile . All this sort of nonsense  --  production for social waste  --  has taken the place of colonialism in mid-twentieth-century economy . A clinical psychologist living on a steel worker 's unpaid wages is fulfilling exactly the same social function as one of Masefield 's famous " cheap tin trays " outward bound down the greasy Channel to the reluctant Fuzzy Wuzzys . No more , no less . As for clinical psychology itself , and/or psychoanalysis , does experience substantiate any of their vast claims ? The sick and troubled in this sick and troubled society need help desperately and wise and loving people can help them . If their medicine bundles , full of rats ' teeth and oddly shaped pebbles and bats ' dung , give them the necessary confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . But when Ernest Jones says that if he could have gotten Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin and Churchill and Roosevelt on his couch he could have changed history , we are dealing with a badly self-deluded thaumaturgist . As for an operation like the OS of the OSS , now called IPAR , it is posited on the assumption of the relative benignity of the society that will make use of its findings , granting that it will turn up bona fide findings . Theoretically , this happy-go-lucky invasion of the sanctity of the person , this analysis of the sources of creativity and nonconformity , could be put to the most vicious uses . Not after some dictator had seized power  --  but simply in the due course of our obviously accelerating decay of liberty and respect for the person . As I pointed out to a well-known Irish novelist who was a fellow hamster , neither Thomas Paine nor Robert Emmett would have submitted to such indignities for an instant . We take them as a normal part of our society . This is all true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all this stuff works . It does n't . There is n't The NATION the slightest evidence that the puddler in Pittsburgh , the man on the line in River Rouge , is one iota happier for all the millions of his wages spent on industrial psychologists . And as for the other side of the coin , Stalin presumably had at his disposal the talents of some of the world 's finest clinical psychologists , trained in the most rigorous ofschools , and yet , according to khrushchev , when it came to a show-down in the cork-lined cellars , all the drugs and brain-washing and psychology proved ineffective and the confessions of the Moscow trials were produced by techniques older by far than those of medicine men or the Neanderthal witch doctors of the caves . Courage and common sense are the first of virtues ; as Johnson said . A brave man can take a lot of punishment , a sensible man can see through a lot of fraud . I do n't really think we have much to fear from a dictatorship serviced by psychologists ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hurting you , even to the extent of a back scratch or a tap on the knee .
