THIS was the American Dream : a sanctuary on the earth for individual man : a condition in which he could be free not only of the old established closed-corporation hierarchies of arbitrary power which had oppressed him as a mass , but free of that mass into which the hierarchies of church and state had compressed and held him individually thralled and individually impotent . A dream simultaneous among the separate individuals of men so asunder and scattered as to have no contact to match dreams and hopes among the old nations of the Old World which existed as nations not on citizenship but subject-ship , which endured only on the premise of size and docility of the subject mass ; the individual men and women who said as with one simultaneous voice : " We will establish a new land where man can assume that every individual man ? not the mass of men but individual men ? has inalienable right to individual dignity and freedom within a fabric of individual courage and honorable work and mutual responsibility . " Not just an idea , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-oval with the birth of America itself , engendered , created , and simultaneous with the very air and word America , - which at that one stroke , one instant , should cover the whole earth with one simultaneous suspiration like air or light . And it was , it did : radiating outward to cover even the old weary repudiated still-thralled nations , until individual men everywhere , who had no more than heardthe name , let alone knew where America was , could respond to it , lifting up not only their hearts but the hopes too which until now they did not know ? or anyway dared not remember ? that they possessed . A condition in which every man would not only not be a king , he would n't even want to be one , He would n't even need to bother to need to be the equal of kings because now he was free of kings and all their similar congeries ; free not only of the symbols but of the old arbitrary hierarchies themselves which the puppet-symbols represented ? courts and cabinets and churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an individual but only as that integer , his value compounded in that immutable ratio to his sheer mindless numbers , that animal increase of his will-less and docile mass . The dream , the hope , the condition which our forefathers did not bequeath to us , their heirs and assigns , but rather bequeathed us , their successors , to the dream and the hope . We were not even given the chance then to accept or decline the dream , for the reason that the dream already owned and possessed us at birth . It was not our heritage because we were its , we ourselves heired in our successive generations to the dream by the idea of the dream . And not only we , their sons born and bred in America , but men born and bred in the old alien repudiated lands , also felt that breath , that air , heard that promise , that proffer that there was such a thing as hope for individual man . And the old nations themselves , so old and so long-fixed in the old concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of change , making oblation to that new dream of that new concept of man by gifts of monuments and devices to mark the portals of that inalienable right and hope : " There is room for you here from about the earth , for all ye individually homeless , individually oppressed , individually unindividualized . " A free gift left to us by those who had mutually travailed and individually endured to create it ; we , their successors , did not even have to earn , deserve it , let alone win it We did not even need to nourish and feed it . We needed only to remember that , living , it was therefore perishable and must he defended in its crises . Some of us , most of us perhaps , could not have proved by definition that we knew exactly what it was . But then , we did n't need to : who no more needed to define it than we needed to define that air we breathed or that word , which , the two of them , simply by existing simultaneously ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together had engendered and created the dream on that first day of America as air and motion created temperature and climate on the first day of time . Because that dream was man 's aspiration in the true meaning of the word aspiration . It was not merely the blind and voiceless hope of his heart : it was the actual inbreathe of his lungs , his lights , his living and unsleeping metabolism , so that we actually lived the Dream . We did not live in the dream : we lived the Dream itself , just as we do not merely live in air and climate , but we live Air and Climate ; we ourselves individually representative of the Dream , the Dream itself actually audible in the strong uninhibited voices which were not afraid to speak clich ? at the very top of them , giving to the clich ? - avatars of " Give me liberty or give me death " or " This to be self-evident that all individual men were created equal in one mutual right to freedom " which had never lacked for truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a validity and immediacy absolving them even of clich ? . T H A T was the Dream : not man created equal in the sense that he was created black or white or brown or yellow and hence doomed irrevocably to that for the remainder of his days ? or rather , not doomed with equality but blessed with equality , himself lifting no hand but instead lying curled and drowsing in the warm and airless bath of it like the yet-wombed embryo ; but liberty in which to have an equal start atequality with all other men , and freedom in which to defend and preserve that equality by means of the individual courage and the honorable work and the mutual responsibility . Then we lost it . It abandoned us , which had supported and protected and defended us while our new nation of new concepts of human existence got a firm enough foothold to stand erect among the nations of the earth , demanding nothing of us in return save to remember always that , being alive , it was therefore perishable and so must be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor and pride and humility . It is gone now . We dozed , slept , and it abandoned us . And in that vacuum now there sound no longer the strong loud voices not merely unafraid but not even aware that fear existed , speaking in mutual unification of one mutual hope and will . Because now what we hear is a cacophony of terror and conciliation and compromise babbling only the mouth-sounds , the loud and empty words which we have emasculated of all meaning whatever ? freedom , democracy , patriotism ? with which , awakened at last , we try in desperation to hide from ourselves that loss . Something happened to the Dream . Many things did . This , I think , is a symptom of one of them . About ten years ago a well known literary critic and essayist , a good friend of long standing , told me that a wealthy widely circulated weekly pictorial magazine had offered him a good price to write a piece about me ? not about my work or works , but about me as a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained why : my belief that only a writer 's works were in the public domain , to be discussed and investigated and written about , the writer himself having put them there by submitting them for publication and accepting money for them ; and therefore he not only would but must accept whatever the public wished to say or do about them from praise to burning . But that , until the writer committed a crime or ran for public office , his private life was his own ; and not only had he the right to defend his privacy , but the public had the duty to do so since one man 's liberty must stop at exactly the point where the next one 's begins ; and that I believed that anyone of taste and responsibility would agree with me . But the friend said No . He said : " You are wrong . If I do the piece , I will do it with taste and responsibility . But if you refuse me , sooner or later someone will do it who will not bother about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you or your status as a writer , an artist , but only ' as a commodity : merchandise : to be sold , to increase circulation , to make a little money . " " I do n't believe it , " 1 said . " Until I commit a crime or announce for office , they ca n't invade my privacy after I ask them not to . " " They not only can , " he said , " but once your European reputation gets back here and makes you financially worth it , they will . Wait and see . " D I D. I did both . Two years ago , by mere chance during a talk with an editor in the house which publishes my books , I learned that the same magazine had already set on foot the same project which I had declined eight years before ; I do n't know whether the publishers were formally notified or if they just heard about it by chance too , as I did . I said No again , recapitulating the same reasons which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the public press , since the qualities of taste and responsibility would have to he inherent in that power for it to be valid and allowed to endure . The editor interrupted . " I agree with you , " he said . " Besides , you do n't need to give me reasons . The simple fact that you do n't want it done is enough . Shall I attend to it for you ? " So he did , or tried to . Because my critic friend was still right . Then I said : " Try them again . Say ' I ask you : please do n't . ' " Then I submitted the same I ash you : please do n't to the writer who was to do the piece . I do n't know whether he was a staff writer designated to the job , or whether he volunteered for it , or perhaps himself sold his employers on the idea . Though my recollection is that his answer implied , " I 've got to , if I refuse they will fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the same answer from a staff-member of another magazine on the same subject . And if that was so , if the writer , a member of the craft he served , was victim too of that same force of which I was victim ? that irresponsible use which is therefore misuse and which in its turn is betrayal , of that power called Freedom of the Press which is one of the most potent and priceless of the defenders and preservers of human dignity and rights ? then the only defense left me was to refuse to co-operate , have anything to do with the project at all . Though by now Iknew that that would not save me , that nothing I could do would stop them . P ER H A P S they ? the writer and his ern-ployer ? did n't believe me , could not believe me . Perhaps they dared not believe me . Perhaps it is impossible now for any American to believe that anyone not hiding from the police could actually not want , as a free gift , his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base or modest or circumscribed in circulation . Though perhaps the matter never reached this point : that both of them ? the publisher and the writer ? knew from the first , whether I did or not , that the three of us , the two of them and their victim , were all three victims of that fault in the sense that the geologist uses the term ) in our American culture which is saying to us daily : " Beware ! , " the three of us faced as one not with an idea , a principle of choice between good and bad taste or responsibility or lack of it , but with a fact , a condition in our American life before which all three of us were ( at that moment ) helpless , at that moment doomed . So the writer came with his group , force , crew , and got his material where and how he could and departed and published his article . But that 's not the point . The writer is nut to be blamed since , empty-handed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired from the job which deprived him of the right to choose between good and bad taste . Nor the employer either , since to hold his ( the employer 's ) precarious own in a craft can compel even him , head and chief of one of its integral components , to serve the mores of the hour in order to survive among his rival ones . It 's not what the writer said , but that he said it . That he ? they ? published it , in a recognized organ which , to be and remain recognized , functions on the assumption of certain inflexible standards ; published it not only over the subject 's protests but with complete immunity to them ; an immunity not merely assumed to itself by the organ but an immunity already granted in advance by the public to which it sold its wares for a profit . The terrifying ( not shocking ; we can not be shocked by it since we permitted its birth and watched it grow and condoned and validated it and even use it individually for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have happened at all under those conditions . That it could have happened at all with its subject not even notified in advance . And even when he , the victim , was warned by accident in advance , he was still completely helpless to prevent it . And even after it was done , the victim had no recourse whatever since , unlike sacrilege and obscenity , we have no laws against had taste , perhaps because in a democracy the majority of the people who make the laws do n't recognize bad taste when they see it , or perhaps because in our democracy bad taste has been converted into a marketable and therefore taxable and therefore lobbyable commodity by the merchandising federations which at the same simultaneous time create the market ( not the appetite : that did not need creating : only pandering to ) and the product to serve it , and bad taste by simple solvency was purified of bad taste and absolved . And even if there had been grounds for recourse , the matter would still have remained on the black side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and costs to operating loss and the increased sales from the publicity to capital investment . T HE POINT is that in America today any organization or group , simply by functioning under a phrase like Freedom of the Press or National Security or League Against Subversion , can postulate to itself complete immunity to violate the individualness ? the individual privacy lacking which he can not be an individual and lacking which individuality he is not anything at all worth the having or keeping ? of anyone who is not himself a member of some organ . ization or group numerous enough or rich enough to frighten them off . That organization will not be of writers , artists , of course ; being individuals , not even two artists could ever confederate , let alone enough of them . Besides , artists in America do n't have to have privacy because they do n't need to be artists as far as America is concerned . America does n't need artists because they do n't count in America ; artists have no more place in American life than the employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of a Mississippi novelist . But there are the other two occupations which are valuable to American life , which require , demand privacy in order to endure , live . These are science and the humanities , the scientists and the humanitarians : the pioneers in the science of endurance and mechanical craftsmanship and self-discipline and skill like Colonel Lindbergh who was compelled at last to repudiate it by thenation and culture one of whose mores was an inalienable right to violate his privacy instead of an inviolable duty to defend it , the nation which assumed an inalienable right to abrogate to itself the glory of his renown yet which had neither the power to protect his children nor the responsibility to shield his grief ; the pioneers in the simple science of saving the nation like Dr. Oppenheimer who was harassed and impugned through those same mores until all privacy was stripped from him and there remained only the qualities of individualism whose possession we boast since they alone differ us from animals ? gratitude for kindness , fidelity to friendship , chivalry toward women , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vetted harassers were impotent , turning away themselves ( one hopes ) in shame , as though the whole business had had nothing whatever to do with loyalty or disloyalty or security or insecurity , but was simply to batter and strip him completely naked of the privacy lacking which he could never have become one of that handful of individuals capable of serving the nation at a moment when apparently nobody else was , and so reduce him at last to one more identityless integer in that identityless anonymous unprivacied mass which seems to be our goal . And even that is only a point of departure . Because the sickness itself goes much further back . It goes back to that moment in our history when we decided that the old simple moral verities over which taste and responsibility were the arbiters and controls , were obsolete and to he discarded . It goes back to that moment when we repudiated the meaning which our fathers had stipulated for the words " liberty ' ' and " freedom , " on and by and to which they founded us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves in our time keeping only the mouth-sounds of them . It goes hack to the moment when we substituted license in the place of liberty ? license for any action which kept within the proscription of laws promulgated by confederations of the practitioners of the license and the harvesters of the material benefits . It goes back to that moment when in place of freedom we substituted immunity for any action to any recourse , provided merely that the act be performed beneath the aegis of the empty mouth-sound of freedom . At which instant truth vanished too . We did n't abolish truth ; even we could n't do that . It simply quit us , turned its back on us , not in scorn nor even contempt nor even ( let us hope ) despair . It just simply quit us , to return perhaps when whatever it will be ? suffering , national disaster , maybe even ( if nothing else will serve ) military defeat ? will have taught us to prize truth and pay any price , accept any sacrifice ( oh yes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put off having to be as long as possible ) to regain and hold it again as we should never have let it go : on its own compromiseiess terms of taste and responsibility . Truth ? that long clean clear simpie undcviable unchallengeable straight and shining line , on one side of which black is black and on the other white is white , has now become an angle , a point of view having nothing to do with truth nor even with fact , but depending solely on where you are standing when you look at it . Or rather ? better ? where you can contrive to have him standing whom you are trying to fool or obfuscate when he looks at it . A C R.0 S S the board in fact , a parlay , a daily triple : truth and freedom and liberty . The American sky which was once the topless empyrean of freedom , the American air which was once the living breath of liberty , are now become one vast down-crowding pressure to abolish them both , by destroying man 's individuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last vestige of privacy without which man can not be an individual . Our very architecture itself has warned us . Time was when you could see neither from inside nor from outside through the walls of our houses . Time is when you can see from inside out though still not from outside in through the walls . Time will be when you can do both . Then privacy will indeed be gone ; he who is individual enough to want it even to change his shirt or bathe in , will be cursed by one universal American voice as subversive to the American way of life and the American flag . If ( by that time ) walls themselves , opaque or not , can still stand before that furious blast , that force , that power rearing like a thunder-clap into the American zenith , multiple-faced yet mutually conjunctived , bellowing the words and phrases which we have long since emasculated of any significance or meaning other than as tools , implements , for the further harassment of the private individual human spirit , by their furious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subversion . " " Anti-Communism . " " Christian i ty . " " Prosperity . " " The American Way . " " The Flag . " I T H ODDS at balance ( pins a little fast footwork now and then of course ) one individual can defend himself from another individual 's liberty . But when powerful federations and organizations and amalgamations like publishing corporations and religious sects and political parties and legislative committees can absolve even one of their working units of the restrictions of moral responsibility by means of such catch-phrases as " Freedom " and " Salvation " and " Security " and " Democracy , " beneath which blanket absolution the individual salaried practitioners are themselves freed of individual responsibility and restraint , then let us beware . Then even people like Dr. Oppenheimer and Colonel Lindbergh and me ( the weekly magazine staff-writer too if he really was compelled to choose between good taste and starvation ) will have to confederate in our turn to preserve that privacy in which alone the artist and scientist and humanitarian can function . Or to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humanitarians , but the parents by law or biology of doctors of osteopathy too . I am thinking of course of the Cleveland doctor convicted recently of the brutal slaying of his wife , three of whose parents ? his wife 's father and his own father and mother ? with one exception did not even outlive that trial regarding which the Press itself , which kept the sorry business on most of the nation 's front pages up to the very end , is now on record as declaring that it was overcovered far beyond its value and importance . I am thinking of the three victims . Not the convicted man : he will doubtless live a long time yet ; but of the three parents , two of whom died ? one of them anyway ? because , to quote the Press itself , " he was wearied of life , " and the third one , the mother , by her own hand , as though she had said , I can bear no more of this . Perhaps they died solely because of the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not with the commission of the murder but with the publicity of the trial . And if it was not solely because of the tragedy itself that one of the victims was " wearied of life " and another obviously said , I can bear no more ? if they had more than that one reason to relinquish and even repudiate life , and the man was guilty as the jury said he was , just what medieval witch-hunt did that power called Freedom of the Press , which in any civilized culture must be accepted as that dedicated paladin through whose inflexible rectitude truth shall prevail and justice and mercy be done , condone and abet that the criminal 's very progenitors be eliminated from the earth in expiation of his crime ? And if he was innocent as he said he was , what crime did that champion of the weak and the oppressed itself participate in ? Or ( to repeat ) not the artist . America has not yet found any place for him who deals only in things of the human spirit except to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to advertise automobiles and cruises and resort hotels , or ( if he can be taught to contort fast enough to meet the standards ) in radio or moving pictures where he can produce enough income tax to be worth attention . But the scientist and the humanitarian , yes : the humanitarian in science and the scientist in the humanity of man , who might yet save that civilization which the professionals at saving it ? the publishers who condone their own battening on man 's lust and folly , the politicians who condone their own trafficking in his stupidity and greed , and the churchmen who condone their own trading on his fear and superstition ? seem to be proving that they can't.
