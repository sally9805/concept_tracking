txt Final votes on four major bills , each already thoroughly debated , were all that stood tonight between Congress and adjournment . A wind-up by tomorrow night was clearly possible following the Senate Finance Committee 's decision , reached last night by an 11-to-4 vote ; not to act at this session on the Administration 's request for an increase in the national debt ceiling from $275,000 , . 000,000 to $290,000,000,000 . Speculation cropped up  --  and was quickly discounted  --  that the White House might be bidding to revive the issue when it was announced this afternoon that President ? Eisenhower was having George M. Humphrey , Secretary of the Treasury , and Senator Eugene D. Millikin of Coloradg , the Finance Committee chairman , as breakfast guests tomorrow . Mr. Millikin said he did not , know why he washeing invited to breakfast but added that he had " not the slightest indication. , that the purpose was to try to bring up the debt limit again in the Senate . " " After all , that decision to with . hold action was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Is Doubtful " I would not think the Administration would undertake to try , to bring it up again for immediate action , " said Senator Walter F. George of Georgia , ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee . In other quarters it was thouglt the Administration was seeking agreement on when it would be best to recall Congress if the Mv ernment 's fiscal authorities deter . mined a breakthrough of the present debt ceiling could not be averted . Other guests at the White House breakfast will be Senator William F. Knowland - of California , the acting Republican Senate leader ; Joseph M. Dodge , Director of the Budget , and Maj. Gen. Wilton Persons , top White House liaison officer on Capitol Hill . , Much of the speculation arose from the fact that Secretary Humphrey issued a statement , some time before the brief announcement of the breakfast I meeting , in which he said : " We received word late Satur. 1day of the Senate Finance Com . mittee action on the debt limit request . We are giving the subject consideration and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The four " must " items remaining on the Congressional agenda are three appropriation bills , two still in relatively minor dispute , and the one-year extension of the reciprocal trade program . Only Senate approval is required to send the trade bill and the $6,652,422,390 foreign aid bill to the White ' House , Conference reports on the two programs were approved in the House of Repro .. sentatives yesterday . Awaiting action by both Senate and House is the catch-all $615 , . // 989,964 ' supplemental appropriation bill . This measure , containing all the Administration 's last - minute requests for funds , carried *200 , - 000,000 for . Korean relief , $75,000 , - 000 for the new United States Information ' Agency , $70,100,000 in Federal aid for school construction in defense areas and $46,500,000 for civil defense . The Senate upset yesterday an earlier conference agreement on this bill that omitted the funds for school construction aid . This sent the measure back to conference where the new money figure , presumably eliminating the last objections , was fixed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it inserted in the State , Commerce and Justice Departments money bill to assist local government in constructing airports . The House has refused to accept this item in an otherwise acceptable $1,100 , - 000,000 funds bill . With the workday to be broken at noon for memorial services in the Rotunda of the Capitol for Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio , both Senate and House convene early tomorrow . The Senate will meet at 10 A. M. , and the House at 11 A. M. Senate approval of both the reciprocal trade bill and the Mutual Security money measure appeared certain because both , closely approximated the measures it originally passed . Even if the Senate gets through quickly with " must " legislation already out of conference , it still has a large batch of bills , many of considerable if not major importance , that await action . Among these is one to increase the Federal Government 's authority through the Food and Drug Administration to make factory inspections . Another specifies that , while the Atomic Energy Commisslop is exempt from local taxes , contractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate-House conferees on a Federal judgeship bill were so hopelessly snarled last night it appeared doubtful ' a compromise could . be . reached before adjournment . Republican plans , for a Senate party conference on Tuesday to select a new leader would not be upset by an adjournment tomorrow ; Senator Millikin , chairman of the Republican Conference , said the selection of a Republican Floor Leader was a matter strictly for party action . The matter need only be brought to the Senate floor , he said ; in the event that Republican leadership was challenged . ? With Senator Wayne Morse , Independent of Oregon , prepared to vote to continue Republican majority control , the prospect , once . vacancies were filled , was for a Senate divided 48 to 48 with Vice President Richard M , Nixon holding the . deciding vote . Thus Mr. Nixon would be in -a position to resolve the issue in favor of the Republicans if the Democrats should raise a challenge . In the absence of announced candidates , Senator Knowland continued to be most prominently mentioned in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an acting basis .
