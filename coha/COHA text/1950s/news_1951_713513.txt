Allied pilots said they saw the heaviest traffic yet observed in Korea behind the enemy lines . They reported 1,200 vehicles clogging North Korean roads . The Allies in a skillful retreat had yielded Seoul , its airfield at Kimpo , and the port of Inchon . At Inchon , UN units blasted docks and the tidal basin , then left by sea . The main body of UN troops moved southward by land . ROKs Break Out of Trap Four cut-off South Korean regiments broke through Commtibist roadblocks and reached UN lines north of Wonju after a four-day battle . With the South Koreans safely back , UN lines were drawn closer around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through valleys could turn left or right at Wonju and possibly cut off parts of the Allied forces . It was a desperate race . Lt. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway , United States Eighth Army commander , returned to his headquarters after visiting two of his army corps defending the retreat . " Everything is going fine , " he said . But he said the retreat from Seotil was dwarfed by the tragedy of hundreds of thousands of Koreans unable to get out ahead of the oncoming Communists .

" In plunging down the icy slopes of central Korea , the Chinese armies were following the same path as their North Korean comrades when they swept over the lightly defended and demoralized South Korean republic last July . An Associated Press correspondent reported that the evacuation of Inchon was completed early Jan. 5 . He said the docks and harbor of the port for Seoul were blown up by demolition crews and the last two landing ships pulled out of the ruined harbor when high tide lifted them off the muddy bottom . As the demolition crews worked , the big guns of the heavy cruiser Rochester laid down a wall of steel to protect the men from Communists who had crossed the Han River and were headed for Inchon . IRear-Guard Action There were no Allied losses in men in the Inchon area reported to general headquarters here .

Their Churchill tanks and field guns , plus the great courage of the men , helped them to fight their way out of one ambush after another .

The Americans covering the withdrawal stayed behind to bg the last out .
