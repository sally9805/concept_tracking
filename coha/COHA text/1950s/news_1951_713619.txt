txt William 0 . Douglas , Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court , said , " If we continue our present foreign policy , especially in Asia , if we continue in our present direction , we are doomed to disaster . " Mr. Justice Douglas was speaking to a local civic club gathering . He said the Asiatic world is in revolution similar to that which came to France and America . The justice added : " I gathered my information , not in the capitals of the Asiatic countries , but in talking to farmers and goat-herders in the back areas . " The world is different than we in America have thought . The plain fact is that the world is in a revolution that can not be bought off with dollars . There are rumblings in every village from the Mediterranean to the Pacific . " We think of that force as Cornmunistn , but it is not . The Communists only exploit the situation .
