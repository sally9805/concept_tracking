One of the modern reforms instituted by Spain 's short-lived ( 1931-36 ) democratic republic was the outlawry of prostitution . When Dictator Franco seized power , he reinstituted prostitution , set a minimum age of 23 for admission to the profession , charged the police with responsibility for seeing that prostitutes were registered and had regular medical checkups . But Franco 's police , tough on politicals , are lax with prostitutes : only 13,000 cardholders are on their books , but an estimated 100,000 , many of them under 23 , ply their trade freely . In many of the most elegant bars and cafs of Madrid , there are now so many women for hire that respectable caballeros no longer take their wives or fiances to such places after 7 p.m . Spain has a frightening venereal-disease rate : some 200,000 cases annually in public dispensaries , an unknown number treated privately or not at all . <P> Alarmed by the increasing number of prostitutes passing through the University of Granada 's Clinical Hospital , tall , bicycle-riding University Chaplain Father Jos Garcia two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he began a nationwide crusade . Father Garcia fired off a circular to government ministers , church leaders and Roman Catholic intellectuals , denouncing legalized prostitution as " the major shame of the nation . " The appeal brought only one response , but an important one : in Madrid , Jesuit Father Jos Maria Llanos , spiritual counselor of the Falange Youth Front , reprinted Father Garcia 's circular in the Falangist daily Arriba , followed it up with a stinging column accusing Spain 's upper classes of favoring prostitution as a means of protecting their own virtue . " The best people , " said Father Llanos , " want to assure the beautiful innocence of their sons and daughters by means of a very original barricade , one constructed of the souls and bodies of thousands of poor women . " Concluded Llanos : " This wall of flesh must go . " <P> With Father Llanos ' backing , Garcia got Primate of Spain Enrique Cardinal Pla y Deniel behind his campaign . He obtained the cardinal 's signature , together with those of the Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other top-ranking citizens , to a memorandum on prostitution listing a dozen tragic case histories , including that of a 14-year-old girl sold into white slavery by her mother for 700 pesetas ( $17.50 ) . The memorandum was sent to Franco , who replied through channels that he had " taken note " of it . Last week Franco ordered his Minister of Justice to solve the problem " with all possible speed .
