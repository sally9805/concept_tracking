Playwright Tennessee Williams , 43 , whose work surges with all manner of violence , from rape ( A Streetcar Named Desire ) to homosexualism and cannibalism ( Garden District ) , last week took Associated Press Columnist Hal Boyle on a tour of the Williams psyche , on which a psychoanalyst is at work five times a week at $50 an hour . Observed Playwright Williams : " I find it immensely stimulating . " <P> His treatments , Williams said , are helping his old " claustrophobia and a fear of suffocation . It was so bad that for a long time , when I went for a walk , I could n't walk down a street unless I could see a bar - not because I wanted a drink , but because I wanted the security of knowing it was there . <P> " The fear of a threat to his personal security is at the root of every person 's violence and hatreds . Evil is merely a sickness-a psychic distortion . Education has to be revamped so as to cope with a student 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Latin . These problems begin early and if caught in time can be corrected-but not after they explode in violence . Then it is too late . Evil matured is hard to cure . " <P> The main evil of the age ? Says Bachelor Williams : " Overpopulation . I do n't understand why nothing is done to stop this spawning of children in families that ca n't even afford to have one . It is a crime-an awful crime . " <P> Williams is convinced that his own dramas are basically " more concerned with morality than most plays . " So far , Tennessee 's sessions on the couch have not noticeably lightened or sweetened his work . Title of the next play he has in mind for Broadway : Sweet Bird of Youth . The theme : " The corruption of a young man , the corruption of an older woman , and the corruption of an entire community by a political boss . "
