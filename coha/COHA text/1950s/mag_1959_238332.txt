Creativity , one of man 's highest qualities , is one of the least understood . It is not sheer volume of work or novelty of expression ; it is not always virtuous . Creativity is what Feodor Dostoevsky had : a tremendous capacity for sustained , self-motivated work-despite an untidy outer life that included epilepsy , compulsive gambling and enough hardships to stun Job . But few teachers can recognize creativity in children or tolerate it when they do . The child who paints pretty pictures or whizzes through the IQ test is called " gifted . " The one who plants an ingenious stink bomb in the teachers ' smoking room is a case for the cops . <P> Or is he ? Last week , at 9,000-ft. - high Alta in Utah 's Wasatch Mountains , 26 psychologists , educators , industrialists and military men gathered in a National Science Foundation-sponsored meeting to consider creativity . With surprising unanimity , they concluded that 1 ) success in the scientific age is not simply a matter of intellect ; 2 ) U.S. education is distressingly geared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one right answer to a problem ; 3 ) schools ignore the rebellious " inner-directed " child who scores low on IQ tests because they bore him ; 4 ) teachers not only make no effort to nurture the creative rebel but usually dislike him . More than 70% of the " most creative , " reported Educational Psychologist Jacob W. Getzels of the " University of Chicago in a startling guesstimate , are never recognized , and so never have their talents developed . <P> How can they be recognized ? In a joint study , Professors Getzels and Philip W. Jackson traced the traits of " creative " high school students by comparing their likes and dislikes with those of " high-IQ " students . The creative valued humor first ; their opposite numbers ranked " character " first and humor last . What supposedly governs adult success , the researchers decided , is what high-IQ adolescents most value . But creative kids enjoy " the risk and uncertainty of the unknown . . . tend to diverge from stereotyped meanings , to perceive personal success by unconventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what is expected of them . " Concluded Getzels and Jackson : " It is no less than a tragedy that in American education at all levels we fail to distinguish between our convergent and divergent talents-or , even worse , that we try to convert our divergent students into convergent students .
