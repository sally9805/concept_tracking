The rulers ceased in Israel , they ceased , <P> Until that thou didst arise , Deborah , <P> That thou didst arise a mother in Israel . <P> - Judges 5 <P> On the darkened stage of a Manhattan theater , the ancient and moving story unfolded in stately dance and song : Deborah described how she led her nation to victory over Sisera , king of Canaan ; praised Barak , the victorious general ; sang of the heroism of Jael , wife of Hener the Kenite , who killed Sisera when he went to her tent . Then the bearded men and the dark , long-haired women ranged across the stage in a ritualistic dance of victory , chanting their praise of the Lord : " Then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates . " The startling vitality that coursed through last week 's performance sprang from a living tradition : the performers were Yemenites , direct descendants of Jews who fled to southwestern Arabia in the first century B.C. Organized into an Israeli dance troupe that calls itself Inbal ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. for a three-months ' tour . Inbal 's repertory includes eight major dance works drawn from the fabric of Yemenite and Israeli life-the shepherds before their campfires , wedded happiness ( Shabbat Shalom ) , the seven-day Yemenite marriage ceremonies . The bearded male dancers bounded across the stage in exuberant leaps , snapped their bodies into harsh angularities of rage or exaggerated comic pantomime . The women in striped Yemenite smocks moved in sinuous arabesques . Mixed into the dances were chanted Hebrew or Arabic texts , the oriental-flavored sounds of flute , cymbal and drum . <P> Inbal and its repertory are the creation of a remarkable Deborah-like woman named Sara Levi-Tanai . Herself the daughter of emigrant Yemenite parents , she had no formal training in the drama or dance , picked up all she knows by staging school pageants as a kindergarten teacher , mostly in Tel Aviv . When the Jewish population of Yemen was flown to Israel in 1949 , Teacher Levi-Tanai recruited 19 young people who had never danced professionally before , started constructing dances out of bits and scraps of native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : overcoming religious objections of Yemenite Jews to performing in public - most of the dances had been confined to the home or the synagogue . This gave them a cramped style . " The Yemenite Jew never danced in the open , so his movements are sharp as if they have no room . <P> <P> But we must dance like Israelis , a free people . I say : ' Now we are in Israel , so we must be bold and strong . ' " <P> Inbal was a success in Israel from the start . Workers in isolated settlements saw in the dances a reflection of the life they knew ; city audiences , though made up of migrants from a dozen Western countries , sensed the touch of tradition . " I feel that it must be like the old Temple before it was destroyed , " says Sara Levi-Tanai . " Like the days when the Temple had feasting and dancing . " <P> U.S. audiences , regardless of their background , are likely to be similarly moved by the dancers from Yemen . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a basic tongue that everybody can understand .
