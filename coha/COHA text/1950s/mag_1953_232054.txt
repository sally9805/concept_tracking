The first six months of 1953 was a period to warm the cockles of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy 's heart . He bounced from headline to headline , denouncing the use of Communist books in U.S.-sponsored overseas libraries , challenging with cloakroom innuendo the appointment of Charles Bohlen as ambassador to Russia , engaging in a transatlantic cat fight with Britain 's Clement Attlee . But with the adjournment of Congress , McCarthy had to scramble to keep his name in the big black type . He was beginning to sag as a topic of conversation when Harry Truman came to his aid by injecting Joe into the Harry Dexter White case-in which McCarthy had had no part . Last week , with public hearings regarding Communism in the Army Signal Corps radar laboratories at Fort Monmouth , N.J. , McCarthy was bouncing again . <P> Last October , while on his honeymoon in the West Indies , McCarthy learned that the Army had suspended several Fort Monmouth employees as " security risks . " With that , the honeymoon was over . McCarthy flew to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out , rumors of missing microfilm and sinister scientists filtered through , and from time to time McCarthy emerged with dark reports of a Communist espionage ring organized by Atom Spy Julius Rosenberg , which " may still be in existence " at Fort Monmouth . <P> Some papers played nebulous rumors about the evidence as fact ; other papers asserted that McCarthy was getting nowhere . Either way , Joe got the headlines . But the time came when McCarthy was willing to agree with Army Secretary Robert Stevens that the whole probe should be called off . At that point , last month , Stevens took a step that was either a courageous act or a big mistake . At a press conference , two reporters , whose stories had been critical of McCarthy 's hearings , needled Stevens into saying : " We have been unable to find anything relating to espionage . " McCarthy burned and bored into the counterpunch . He grimly promised to open up the hearings and " let the evidence speak for itself . " The Harry Dexter White case , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly enhanced interest in his revival of the Fort Monmouth hearings . <P> From the Grave . Thirty-three Fort Monmouth employees already had been suspended by the Signal Corps , not as a result of McCarthy 's investigation . Some had been reinstated ; most were awaiting hearings . Of the 33 , McCarthy called only one , Aaron Coleman , a classmate of Julius Rosenberg at the City College of New York , who went to Fort Monmouth in 1939 , became a radar laboratory chief . <P> On the witness stand , Coleman admitted attending a Communist meeting with Rosenberg 16 years ago during their senior year at C.C.N.Y. , but he swore that he had never seen , heard from or corresponded with Rosenberg after they left college . McCarthy , who admitted he had no living witnesses to prove the story , confronted Coleman with testimony from Rosenberg 's trial : Rosenberg said that while an inspector at Fort Monmouth in the early 1940 's , he had seen Coleman there . Said McCarthy , threatening a perjury citation against Coleman : " Testimony from the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
