txt Special to THE New YORK TIMES . VIENNA , March 22 ? Eight months after he received a tenyear sentence for alleged espionage William Oatis , former head of The Associated Press Prague bureau reappeared in the same court last week as a witness against twelve of alleged accomplices . That , at least , is what the Prague radio reported , and although there were no Western newspaper men present to check on its account , there is no reason to doubt it . Unresolved , however , is the mystery of why , although Mr. Oatis was tried and convicted two months after he was arrested at the end of # April last year , it took another eight months to bring his alleged ' , accomplices to trial , and why it was considered necessary to invoke the aid of Mr. Oatis to prove them guilty . It had been generally expected that Mr. Oatis would be used when the time came to present the case against Vladimir Clementis , former Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia , and perhaps also against Otto Sling , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie Smermova , member of the Czech Communist party 's Central Committee . In the indictment against Mr , Oatis it was charged that he " had concentrated on collecting information " about the arrest of these purged Communists . Tomas Svoboda , a fellow employe of Mr. Oatis in the Prague Associated Press bureau , had confessed that he had gathered such reports for his chief . Clementis and Sling and Miss Smermova are big game compared to the twelve alleged spies who were sentenced last Saturday , and , although to link Mr. Oatis with such highly placed Communists might strain the bonds of credulity to the breaking point , so did the evidence to prove his connection with the smaller fry condemned last week . Hostage for Ransom The State Department admitted a fortnight ago that the Czechs , had hinted during recent negotiations that to lift the export ban on the $17,000,000 steel mill ordered by Prague but not delivered might be the best way of procuring Mr. Oatis ' release . The department added , however , that no firml offer had been made and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington to connect the two " : matters . In other words , no more ' ' ransoms will be paid for hostages . One interpretation of last week 's ' sudden producing of Mr. Oatis in public was that it was designed to stir up American public opinion to enforce such a deal and also to wring the last bit of propaganda value out of Mr. Oatis before setting the exchange price for him . No American has seen Mr , Oatis except in court during his trial last July since he was arrested in April . Shortly after he was apprehended the United States Embassy in Prague was furnished with a photostat of a letter written by the correspondent to his wife two I days after his arrest . In this letter Mr. Oatis blamed " people who got me into this , " expressed his sincere regret for his acts and said he did not want to see anyone from the ' embassy  --  a statement , of course , ' Which convinced nobody of anything except that he had written it under duress . Continuing Influence Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be felt by those concerned with American-Czechoslovak relations . Mostly because of him Czech air flights over Germany were barred and American trade ' relations with Czechoslovakia vir- ' tually broken off . The United States , Congress , labor unions , newspaper associations and the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations are among the groups that have protested against the unique act of international banditry which his arrest represents , and it is highly likely that it will be brought directly betore the United Nations . Mr. Oatis was the first Western newsman to be condemned for carrying on legitimate newspaper activities . For that is what he was accused of and that is what he ' admitted he did . Under the law for the defense of the Republic of Czechoslovakia it is illegal for any journalist , whether Czech or foreign , to report " information regarding any enterprise , institution , installation or measure that is important for the defense of the republic or its allies , especially regarding the strength , fighting capacity , military movements or the movements of any body of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the official prohibition or the nature of the information or other circumstances , he should have known he was thereby threatening the interests of the state . " It is even illegal to report crimes against the defense of the republic if this information has not been officially released . Tight Restrictions In other words , it is a criminal offense for a foreign newspaper , man to report in Czechoslovakia on those subjects which commonly interest Western newspaper readers unless the Government officially releases the information . Since the Communist Government practically never releases truthful information on such subjects it is an offense to report in Czechoslovakia . American news agencies and newspapers , unlike those in some other Western countries , do not tolerate intelligence activities by their correspondents . Mr. Oatis was arrested to hurt the prestie of the United States and as a hostage for ransom like Robert Vogeler in Hungary . He may have been selected from among his colleagues because he was conscientious , introspective and frail . His colleagues thought it possible that he was picked by the Communists for his very innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
