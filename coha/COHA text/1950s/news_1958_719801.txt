txt Personal incomes , already the major bulwark against the recession , are due for still another important increase over the next few months regardless of general employment conditions . The reason is the passage by Congress of major pay increases for Government workers of all kinds , some retroactive , plus increases for retired workers . The effect of these measures , which include large " lump sum " retroactive increases for many workers , may begin this month and will certainly reach significant proportions next month . The economic impact of this and other factors that " have bolstered incomes beyond general expectations could be important . It is possible that consumer expenditures may provide an independent upward push for the economy  --  something that does not generally occur without a prior net upward movement in the active sectors of Government spending and business investment , with their impact on general employment . If such an upward push from the consumer should come about , then the recovery from the recession could surprise everybody by its vigor . The standard forecast is still for a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small minority of experts here who feel that this may prove too pessimistic . Already incomes have proved surprisingly resistant to the recession . While practically every other major economic indicator has declined more in this recession than in the two other postwar recessions , personal income has declined less than in either . In May , incomes , having risen for three straight months in the face of heavy unemployment , were only nine-tenths of 1 per cent below the peak of last August . Up to now  --  prior to the Federal pay increases ? there have been four main reasons for the strength of incomes : Farm income has moved upward , independent of general business conditions . Jobless Pay A Factor Unemployment compensation payments have increased and have offset roughtly one-third of the loss of wage and salary income . Payments under the Sodial Security program for retired workers and have risen faster than expected , as more ' people than expected applied for and got benefits . A law passed last October and ae administrative decision in March gave a boost to various kinds of veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a $6,000 , - 000,000 increase in the annual rate of incomes from these sources since August , or almost enough to offset the $8,000,000 , - 000 decline in the rate of incomes from wages and salaries . Total personal income in May was at a rate of $344,300,000 , - 000 . The Senate Finance Committee , with two dissents , said again today that it was not convinced of the necessity for a tax c'it to aid recovery . In its report on the corporate and excise tax extension bill that it approved this week , the , committee said that the pro-1 spective high level of Government spending " should constitute a considerable stimulant to the economy . " This and " other measures 1 taken by Congress , may be all that is needed to bring about an economic recovery , " today 's report said . The dissenters we : e. enators Paul H. Douglas of Illinois and Russell B. Long of Louisiana , both Democrats . Both favor tax reduction . The new increases for Government emploe-e will have a triple impact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and postal workers amounting to ebout $350,000,000 in lump sum payments this month and next . At annual rates , this would come to the enormous sum of $4,200,000,00 . Thus the personal income figures for June and July may show a large temporary bulge from this cause . Second , pay increases for all categories of workers , including uniformed military personnel , will be at an annual rate of about $1,400,000,000 . Third , retired civil service workers will get increases in their retirement income at an annual rate of about $300,000 , - 000 . These increases , put together , are enough to have a noticeable impact on total personal incomes , and thus probably on personal consumption expenditures . Already , retail sales have begun to reflect the recovery of incomes over the last three months from the low point reached in February . Retail sales in April and May were each $18,500,000,000 ? up 3 per cent from the recession low of $16,100,000,000 in February and March . Judging from the probable movement of incomes , sales can be expected , at worst , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels would indicate a total increase in consumption at an annual rate of nearly $10 , - 009,000,000 front the recession low  --  easily enough to stimulate a recovery by itself .
