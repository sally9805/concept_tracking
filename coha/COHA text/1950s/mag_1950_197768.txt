The well-to-do families of Chicago 's broad-lawned suburb , Winnetka , Ill. , turned out this week at the red brick community church to honor the man who has been baptizing them , marrying them and preaching to them for 20 years - and loving it . <P> The Rev. Samuel Dacke Harkness , 66 , grew up in a background where theology was orthodox and strict . The son of a Scottish Presbyterian minister , young Sam earned a doctor 's degree from Missouri Valley College and was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1908 . But his experiences in the ministry soon began to jar loose some of the orthodox rivets in his Presbyterianism . <P> Natural Law . In South Dakota he was once called to a farmhouse where the father of five children had died while convalescing from typhoid . To the widow 's tearful question , " Why did God take my husband ? " , Harkness made the stock answer : it was the will of God to which all must submit . But on the drive back to town , the doctor turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her that nonsense about the will of God ? Against my strict orders she gave her husband a meal of fried pork , and it killed him . " Then , says Harkness , " I realized that God does not interfere with the operation of natural law from cause to effect . " <P> Later he was summoned to visit an 18-year-old vagrant who was dying of tetanus . Much to his surprise he heard himself telling the boy : " You have just as good a chance with God as I have . You will be with Him soon , and I 'll stay with you till you get there . " Explains Harkness : " Gone was my previous thinking about the awful justice of God which demanded confession of sin and acceptance of the atonement of Christ on the cross . I only knew that the love of God is broader than the measure of man 's mind . " He gradually came to feel , he says , that the infallibility of the Scriptures is secondary to their value in the disclosure of truth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views soon tagged him as a liberal : Fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan once unsuccessfully opposed Harkness ' appointment to a high office in the Presbyterian General Assembly as " a dangerous heretic . " But Dr. Harkness revels in his unorthodoxy . With his wife he is planning a book to be titled The Confessions of Two Conscientious Hypocrites . Said he recently : " I do n't think anyone can give you a religion ... I think anyone 's religion , to be real and workable , has to be self-originating , forever creative . The church is merely a tool to be used-first , to measure our lives against the best we may know , and second , to accomplish with others what we can not accomplish alone . <P> " Also , I believe the church in recent years has spent so much time telling men how to run their business , and has neglected to make them sufficiently moral to do it ... To me , the Gospel of Christ is marked ' personal , ' and I try to make my ministry informal and human . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant denominations , mostly Presbyterians , Baptists and Methodists .
