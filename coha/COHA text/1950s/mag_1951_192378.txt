The Shell Oil Co. struck petroleum on land leased from the Northern Pacific Railway in northeastern Montana 's Dawson County , and speculators were hustling in last week to snap up the remaining drilling rights on a million acres of surrounding territory . Oilmen are excited about the strike because it is the first commercial well to tap the Montana section of Williston Basin , a vast layer of sedimentary rock under much of . North and South Dakota , Montana , and parts of Canada . The well is only 100 miles from Tioga , N. Dak. , where the first strike in the entire Williston Basin was made four months ago . <P> Taken together , the two wells led some geologists to believe the basin might hold a big new oil pool . They think it may hold as much oil as Canada 's fabulous Leduc pool in Alberta . But no one will know the size of the field until many more wells are drilled . Wall Streeters are not waiting . On the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four days to 64 , the year 's high , while Northern Pacific climbed five points to 47 ? , highest in 20 years .
