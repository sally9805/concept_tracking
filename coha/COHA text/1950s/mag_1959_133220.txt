Somewhere in northwestern Miami  --  hard by a thoroughfare with the delightful W. C. Fields name of Northwest South River Drive-squats the Miami Jai-Alai Fronton . It is , in fact , built in the great architectural tradition of Florida Squatty ; it cunningly combines elements of Moorish castle and all-night drugstore into one ugly lump . Last spring I visited this pleasure palace ( season : December 14-April 9 ) and made some small donations to its rent , light bill and the aged and infirm of the state of Florida . In the process , I found jai alai has changed some since my day . // My day was 21 years ago , in the fall of 1938 , when my Uncle Frank  --  the family sport  --  took me to see an earlier-day species of jai alai at New York 's old Hippodrome . It was early September  --  the Giants were pitching Cliff Melton against the hapless Dodgers , Don Budge was playing Gene Mako at Forest Hills and the ' last sport in the world that I wanted to watch on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought it had something to do with slapping a small ball attached to a paddle with a long rubber band , and it struck me as dull entertainment for a warm green-and-gold afternoon . But Uncle Frank , in his capacity as family sport , had seen jai alai in Chicago once and said it was a great game . Furthermore , with a certain firmness of purpose , he said we were going to jai alai or we were going nowhere . I never looked a gift uncle in the mouth . When we reached the Hippodrome the first game had already started . We pushed our way up in the stands to our seats , which were high up , and sat down . // Like any young man growing up in New York City I had been to the Hippodrome as many times as I could con anyone into taking me there . I had seen Treasure Island performed on the big stage with what I was convinced was a real ship manned by real pirates shooting real bullets , some of them at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a large elephant slide into a tank of water  --  this may be as illusory as the bullets or maybe somebody told me he had seen the elephants , but it was the kind of thing you were apt to find there . At any rate , I had seen nothing like the Hippodrome during a jai alai matinee . The stage and the elephant tank were gone . In their place was a vast three-walled room the size of the old ? le de France . Four young men with baskets strapped to their arms were running up and down the length of the room , flailing at a small and elusive ball with their baskets . There was a wire mesh screen between us and the young men . Very shortly one of the young men ran up this wire screen , caught the ball in his basket , hurled it against the distant front wall of the three-wall room , then turned around and ran down the screen again . " It 's the sportsman 's sport , " said my Uncle Frank , dutifully I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side in his seat , and I decided he was trying to find someone he knew . Since it was unlikely that I knew anybody I decided to ignore both audience and game for a few minutes , and settled down to read the instructive literature which had come with my ticket . I was a quick lad , and with a little research I figured I could find out what was going on . // NOTHING TO IT // My program started with a large , no-fooling headline which said " Jai-Alai . Just say ' Hi-Li . ' Messrs . Mike Jacobs , Lee Shubert and Richard Berenson bring Spain 's Sensational Pastime to New York . " This was some help already . It went on to say , " A far cry from the early sixteenth century in Spain when a group of barefoot boys first tossed a spongy ball against the blank walls of an old village church ... Jai-Alai is probably the most strenuous of all athletics .... Fatalities have run high since the sport was founded . Players frankly admit they never know when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . A surgeon and physician are on duty at all times .... " // It continued , as I remember , by noting that this two-a-day brush with death made close comrades and great sportsmen out of both jai alai players and their fans . " Their life at the edge of danger breeds a warm kinship , " concluded the section I was reading . " Theirs is the sportsman 's sport . " I was discouraged to find that last phrase . It always disillusioned me to catch Uncle Frank stealing his material . I looked at him with my best look of reproach , but he was too busy squirming around to look back . // A SPANISH POTPOURRI // After this section there was a neat , small-type box , which explained that the 20 jai alai players who had graciously come north to give New Yorkers this exhibition of their skill were a mixed batch of Basques , Castilians , Mexicans and Valencians , and that all spoke Spanish . It went on to say that " These practitioners of this most dangerous and skillful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval for their athletic efforts "  --  or words to that effect . " Since they do not speak English , for the most part , you may wish to salute their efforts in their native language , a sportsmanlike gesture you can be sure will be appreciated . You will notice that there are always two teams , the Blue Team and the White Team . " I looked up and was gratified to find that in the still-incomprehensible melee on the other side of the screen I could make out two colors of shirts , blue and white . " To salute the Blue Team , it is appropriate to say ' ? Arriba Azul ! To salute the White Team , one may say ' ? Arriba Blanco ! ' Whatever you say , you may be sure that the players will redouble their efforts at your behest . " // I examined the teams , and finally decided that I wanted the white team to redouble its efforts . There was a man wearing glasses on the white team . I wore glasses too , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ? Arriba blanco ! " I said , fudging that upside-down exclamation point . As if in reply my hero turned a somersault , scooped up the ball and thwacked it neatly off two or three walls and over the heads of his opponents . " ? Arriba azul ! " said an old lady in the seat next to mine . We traded arribas for a while . Then one of the white players slipped and fell and missed what looked like an easy shot ; the fans , presumably all through reading their programs , stood up and applauded him politely as he got to his feet . The game started again , the spectators continued to applaud good efforts and missed shots , and by the time it reached its final points great welling shouts of arriba this and arriba that were filling the Hippodrome. // " I do hope the next game 's as exciting , " said the old lady to me as the azules won the last point . " They 're such good sports . Always helping each other up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? " Not many people asked me my opinion on athletic prowess or anything else in those days . I was framing an answer on just how hard I thought they tried when my itchy uncle twitched , took me by the hand , lowered his head and led me out into the warm and dusty sunlight of the afternoon . I knew better than to ask him where we were going , although I certainly would have liked to have said something to that old lady . As we went out through the Hippodrome lobby I still had the feeling that Uncle Frank was looking for somebody . // I found out  --  a little late  --  just whom he was looking for when I paid my recent visit to the Hippodrome 's more successful Miami counterpart . I bought tickets for my wife and myself  --  the tickets seemed extraordinarily inexpensive for such a lavish entertainment  --  and walked into the Fronton 's lobby . Sitting in a circular booth was a blonde ; above her was a sign saying " Leaving Early ? Place Wagers on 8-9-10-11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows surmounted by neat signs saying " $10 Win . " I 've grown up some since those breathless days at the old Hippodrome in New York , and I know the festive earmarks of a pari-mutuel setup when I see one . What I did n't know , although through one time and another I must have had several score chances to , was that the gentle art of wagering had been extended to Messrs . Jacobs , Shubert and Berenson 's Sportsman 's Sport . Poor Uncle Frank . His Chicago jai alai , I have since discovered , had featured large signs saying " No Betting Allowed . " The spectators used these signs as a form of handy pleasure buoy ; the signs marked the men who were taking bets . In jai alai 's free-and-easy Chicago days Uncle Frank must have felt the sure sporting pull of a small bet on the blancos . No wonder that he found the Hippodrome an itchy place to visit . // I quickly discovered that certain changes had crept into the sportsman 's sport since its New York days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net , but the Fronton was cleaner and brighter , and its illumination was further abetted by a large tote board . There were some new varieties of colored shirts  --  I discerned yellows , greens and orchids on the players warming up  --  and there was a hard-to-measure extra buzz of excitement in the background chatter of the spectators . We climbed up the gentle slope of the seats and sat down , appropriately enough , I felt , close to several old ladies . Most of them , I noted with nostalgia , were assiduously studying their programs . // " Programs are very interesting , " I said to my wife . " Tell you what to yell at the players . Audience is a big part of a jai alai game . Players need lots of encouragement . Very dangerous game . You yell at ' em in Spanish . Sportsman 's sport . " I opened my program to find out what to yell at a player in an orchid shirt and was confronted by some good-sized type saying " All Major League Jai-Alai Players MUST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This was an unexpected change from the barefoot boys and spongy ball of an earlier day . I read further . " Any player who is thought to be intentionally playing an inferior grade of Jai-Alai ... must be immediately suspended and a report filed with the Florida State Racing Commission .... Such players are automatically SUSPENDED from the Major League for life .... The Major League maintains a worldwide investigation service and each candidate is thoroughly screened and investigated , not only as to his ability but as to character and reputation before a Major League contract is offered . " // A CHANGE OF PACE // This indeed seemed to be a toothsome rule , although I felt it lacked the ingenuous sportsmanship and good will of the Hippodrome 's program . I read on . It turned out that there were up to eight teams in each game ; that each team played in rotation ; that you bet on the teams as if they were horses ; and that there were some modes of selection provided for the adventuresome bettor which could win him $700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , I obtained the services of an attractive young lady wearing a flat hat , resembling the ones British sailors wear , and a telephone headset . She was also wearing a coat of claret velvet and a bunch of lace at her chin , like the highwayman in the poem . Feeling that the resemblance might be significant , I told her I wanted to put $5 on one Muguerza II , to place . // " Huh ? " she said . // " Muguerza II , " I said . " The one with glasses . " // " What race ? " she said . // " Second game , " I said . // " His number 's 3 , " she said , writing out a receipt and phoning in my bet . " Names do n't mean nothin ' to me . Just gim me the numbers . " // I waited until she got decently out of earshot and leaned over to my wife . " They 've commercialized it , " I said . " But watch the fans . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // The lights on the court turned up , there was a brief parade of the participants climaxed by a perfunctory wave of their baskets at the audience and the first game started . Directly that play began , one of our neighboring old women jumped to her feet and shouted " Come on , 6 ! " // " There they go , " I noted to my wife . " Jai alai fans are famous sports . Once it starts . You ca n't hold ' em . " // " Kill ' em , you bum , " said the old lady . // Here the old lady 's protagonist , the young man evidently named 6 , missed what I thought was an extraordinarily difficult shot , a low and hard and evil shot which sent him sprawling spread-eagled against the screen in a hurtling effort to return it . " Look at the jerk , " said the old lady . " He coulda got it . He lay down . Get up , you pigeon . " She tore up a pari-mutuel ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // SOUNDS FROM THE STANDS // " Money corrupts , " I said . " But there 're still plenty of fans . Listen . You 'll hear ' em . They shout in Spanish . " As if in magic answer , I became aware of a muted sound behind me . I nudged my wife and turned around to single out the chanter , who proved to be a young bald man in a sports jacket with a handkerchief saying " Why Worry ? " protruding from his breast pocket . " Listen , " I said . We listened . As more teams were eliminated one by one , his incantation became gradually louder , and by the time there were just two teams left it was perfectly plain what he was saying . He was saying " Miss it . Miss it . Miss it , " over and over to the opponents of his team . Finally one of his players shared the fate of the unhappy No. 6 , crashing into the side wall at the apex of a high and vain leap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the bald man , varying his chant . " They make it look good . They can get any shot if they want . " This was not the jai alai I knew , and I felt it was time to defend the old order . " Why 's he lying there bleeding ? " I asked . // " Act , " said the bald man , smirking . " They all do it . They 're all actors . They rehearse , like wrestlers . They all got money on the game . You want they should be honest too ? Guys like you , they never learn . " // " How about The Rule with Teeth ? " // " Come off it , buddy . It 's all fixed . It has to be . It 's just a big man race . You bet on men , you get a fix . What 's gon na keep a guy from laying down for a buddy once in a while ? " // " How do you know ? " asked my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . Nobody knows . You ca n't know . That 's the trouble . Hell , it 's a Spanish game , Americans ca n't even understand it . " He tapped his program . " ' Quiniela . Quiniela Exacta . ' Even the bets are in Spanish . They 're all foreigners out there . You ca n't expect ' em to be honest , can you ? " // " Why do you bet ? " said my wife . // The bald man was waiting for that question . " I do n't know how the fix is in . It does n't bother me none . I just play the colors myself . Tonight I 'm playing the blue . I 'm only four bucks behind . " He excused himself at this point and headed down for the pari-mutuel windows , consulting his program as he went . // So it went throughout the evening . Nary an arriba . Not a cheer . The Fronton was a pool of suspicion , filled with curses , whistles , boos ; vibrating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , " " Kill him " and other pleasantries . Finally we came to the 11th game , only four bucks behind ourselves , and decided to beat the rush out . We walked back down the slope , fending our way through the cigar smoke , and about halfway down we passed two comely girls wearing black shawls who were standing on their seats and shouting with animation and enthusiasm . And they were shouting in Spanish . // " There they are , " I said . " At last . The real McCoy . The fans . Listen . " A quick , tripping tinkle of Spanish issued from the two young ladies . // " What are they saying ? " asked my indulgent wife . // " I will find out , " I said . I walked over to the cheering girls , tugged at the skirt of the nearer and asked her what her companion was saying . // " She 's cheering , " she said . " The green team . " // " Of course , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , by the way ? " // " She 's telling them to cut the yellow team in half . With the ball . "
