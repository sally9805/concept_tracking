" It is difficult , " pontificated the Times of London two years ago , " to imagine either extreme nationalism or a scrupulous addiction to neutrality arising seriously in the Maldives . " Seldom has the Times been more wrong . <P> Unceremoniously kicked out of their sea-air bases by newly independent and neutralist Ceylon , the British decided to set up new bases farther south on the placid island of Gan in the Maldives , a splatter of palm-fringed dots in the Indian Ocean 400 miles from Ceylon . There are only 93,000 Maldivians-nut-brown , peaceable folk who have been under the wing of the British Empire since 1802 . The world has largely passed the Maldives by . But six years ago , after 800 years of Sultanate rule , the Maldives became a republic . Their first President abolished purdah , designed a Mother Hubbard national costume for Maldivian women , and pushed a road-building program for the island 's three cars-which all happened to be his . The Maldivians soon got rid of him . <P> When the British began landing workmen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maldivian Parliament grumbled audibly about the arrival of progress . There was a flurry of demands for independence , charges that too many concessions had been made to the British , and loud outcries that the Maldivian way of life was in danger . Once again a government fell , and a new Prime Minister , Ibrahim Nasir , asked that work on Gan be halted . In reply , Britain 's High Commissioner Alec Morley steamed from Ceylon to the Maldives aboard the cruiser Gambia , and that led to hysteric Maldivian outcries of " gunboat diplomacy . " Because of Britain 's eagerness to establish a new steppingstone airbase to break the flight from Europe to Australia and New Zealand , the British are pushing grimly ahead with construction . <P> Not everybody in the Maldives shares the government 's horror at the peaceful invasion , though the islands ' simple economy of coir ( coconut fiber ) and dried fish was totally disrupted by the British arrival . ( Also disrupted was the domestic economy of Ceylonese housewives who regard Maldivian fish as an indispensable ingredient of curry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounces per adult . ) Gan 's schoolteachers quit their jobs to sign on as high-paid laborers on the base , joining the 1,200 workmen imported from Pakistan . A Maldivian official sent from the capital island of Male to persuade the people of Gan to go back to their proper jobs was attacked by a mob and had to appeal to the British for protection . <P> The British insist that they can not understand just what " the Maldivians are up to . " Replied a Maldivian spokesman : " We do not want to be involved in world controversies . "
