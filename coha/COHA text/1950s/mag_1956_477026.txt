When you buy a car you may get caught ? and financially mangled ? in the strange fight between the men who make autos and those who sell them . N0W before Congress are a number of bills intended to protect a group of merchants from the industry which makes their product . These businessmen are anything but believers in government interference with free enterprise . Quite the contrary ? they are the car dealers , the most typical of prosperous , local entrepreneurs and by reputation the most contentedly conservative . But recently they have been in such a desperate , mutinous mood that they cried out to Congress for help , and the form in which that help is going to be extended ? if and when ? will he of interest to anyone who owns , or plans to buy , a car . The automobile industry , as everyone knows , is not doing as well this year as its official optimists expected . One factory executive who first set 1956 sales at 6.500,000 cars has dropped his estimate to 5,800,000 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants have risen steadily , involving 185,000 workers by May . When spring sales should have been rising , car dealers were crushed under stocks of 900,004 ) new automobiles , twice the normal inventory ; and in May salesmen fell short of their quotas by 25,000 cars . But even last year , the biggest in auto history . the warning flags were up . The men who actually sell automobiles were even then in a state of near-revolt . Last fall the Senate mailed a special questionnaire to America 's 42,000 new-car dealers , in the hope of finding out ? among other things ? whether persistent complaints of trouble in the industry represented a majority view . By any survey standards , the response was overwhelming . Twenty thousand dealers replied , and nearly three out of four said that their marketing problems were so serious it would take the government to solve them . A scant 10 per cent definitely opposed federal intervention . Since this mandate came from businessmen usually wary of any meddling in their affairs , many Congressmen assumed their plight to be desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been other signs of trouble brewing in the auto business . Reckless advertising , for example . In a recent issue of the Shreveport Journal , a firm called Superior Buick said it was " Volume Mad and Trading Crazy . " Beneath this banner , it advised shoppers : " Before you buy a car ? in any price class ? check our figures . We beat any deal . Superior do n't care ! . . . Down payment ? Superior do n't care ! Monthly payment ? Superior do n't carel Trade-in allowance ? Superior do n't carer A Los Angeles Ford dealer saluted readers with this militant statement : " The fight 's on . If other dealers want to give their profits away , we will , too . " For the past three years , consumers have been deluged with such absurdities . Obviously , a car salesman likes to make a profit as well as the next businessman and , unless he really is crazy , he cares a great deal about credit terms . One credit mistake can mean a repossession and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resell it . Nevertheless , ads denying interest in either profit or sound financing are commonplace today . Many of them are deceptive , as Better Business Bureaus will testify , and most of them are designed to confuse shoppers . Their sole aim is to bring prospects to the showroom . Since 1953 , trade-in allowances have borne no relation to resale values . Even when a Washington dealer promised over the radio to allow a customer at least $700 for a car that had to be towed in , he failed to arouse much enthusiasm among listeners . Most of them thought his offer only fair , in spite of the fact that a car that wo n't run is worth about $35 at current junk prices . A new kind of enterprise ? the new car supermarket ? has sprung up on highways near big cities . While more conventional auto dealers sell one or two makes produced by the same manufacturer , the supermarket operator sells every make he can get . Johnnie Eagle 's , a lot near Wichita , Kansas , recently advertised 1956 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevrolets , Pontiacs , Buicks , and Oldsmobiles , all backed with factory warranty . Eagle boasted that his low overhead meant savings to customers . He even told the source of his merchandise . Unable to buy from auto factories , he purchased his cars from franchised dealers . Most supermarket owners used to be used-car dealers , and the majority still skip such luxuries as enclosed buildings , replacement parts , and repair shops . Generally , their principal asset is a neon sign ; their biggest expense , advertising . When they talk about low overhead , they are n't kidding . But if something goes wrong with a car they sell , it 's up to someone else to fix it . Some of the danger signs are less obvious to consumers . One is the prevalence of packing , the practice of adding from $200 to $500 to the suggested retail price of a new car . As a rule , the " pack " is the secret behind offers of $1,000 for a car worth less than half that amount . Itprovides dealers with bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car from 22 per cent to around 40 per cent . But the pack has other uses , too . Most industry experts agree that maximum credit terms for a new car should not exceed a down payment of one-third of the purchase price , with two years to pay the balance . Following that rule , a $2,700 automobile requires a down payment of $900 . Suppose , however , that a prospect with a yen for the $2,700 model has no ready cash and an old car worth only $700 on the resale market . For an enterprising dealer , it 's no problem at all to arrange credit for this customer . He simply adds $300 to the purchase price of the new car and $300 to the trade-in allowance , lifting the new car price to $3,000 and the valuation on the old car to $1,000 . On paper , at any rate , the customer has made his down payment of one-third , and he can swing the deal without an extra penny of cash . 110W TO GET SINGED I N PRACTICE the pack is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is offered immediately . The danger of this sort of tricky arithmetic is obvious . For many months , the customer often owes much more on his note than his car is worth . If the dealer is forced to repossess , he suffers a serious loss . If it happens often enough , the whole car market can go into a downspin. - There 's little doubt that customers with a proclivity for haggling have been getting good buys for their money in spite of the pack , Under the slightest pressure , dealers give it right . back to them ? and snore . But the few who still believe retailers mean what they say are getting singed badly . One dealer told me about a prospect who entered his showroom and asked the price of a de luxe model . Looking him straight in the eye , the salesman quoted a figure packed by about $400 . To the dealer 's subsequent embarrassment , the customer whipped out his pen and wrote a check for the padded price . " What could I do ? " the dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was phony , he 'd have walked out of the showroom . When he finds out later that he 's been clipped , he 'll tell everybody I 'm a crook , anyway . " The supermarkets have their secrets , too . While factories deliver new cars to franchised dealers by rail or truck , cars bound for new-car " department stores " are often driven to their destinations with speedometers disconnected . A large number have been driven too hard and too fast , then resold to unsuspecting bargain hunters as new cars . " Franchised dealers have played a key role in this new traffic by selling , or " bootlegging , " surplus cars to supermarket operators for a quick profit of $25 or so . In most states , it is perfectly legal for a dealer to sell cars to anyone he chooses , but in practice bootlegging has become a twilight traffic . It often involves falsifying registration records , and franchised dealers escape the important responsibility of putting new cars in safe running condition . LOSING MONEY THE HARD WAY B V LAST fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't doing very well . After selling a record 7,200,000 new cars in 1955 , their profits were near the vanishing point . According to the National Automobile Dealers Association , auto dealers last year reported an average profit before taxes of only 1.7 per cent of sales . That was just about the most pitiful showing of any group of retailers in the nation . Dun and Bradstreet figures disclose that dealer bankruptcies rose 55 per cent in the first four months of 1956 over the same period last year . A number of economists have argued that all these changes in auto retailing are only symptoms of a revolution in merchandising . At the national convention of auto dealers in Washington this year , Dr. Charles Franklin Phillips ? college president , part-time GM dealer , and World War II rationing chief ? warned his audience that they were playing a new kind of ball game . Gone are the postwar days of high profits and long lines of car-hungry customers , he said . The principles of volume selling ? which were adopted in selling groceries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto business . Dealers had better face that fact and adjust to it . Thousands of retailers who heard Dr. Phillips ' address sat on their hands when he finished . In their opinion , and subsequently in that of many Congressmen , the retailing revolution was more like a reign of terror . One dealer who had managed to survive the new era fairly successfully was an Albany Pontiac salesman named M. H. Yager . Last fall , he wrote a long , emotional letter to Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney , acting chairman of a Senate antitrust subcommittee investigating the policies of General Motors . Yager was sick of the automobile business . Among other things , he charged that the retailing revolution was inspired , not by the vagaries of the market place , but by a handful of executives in Detroit . GM 's " present administration , " he said , had been trying to " brainwash " its dealers to force them into unethical distribution methods . Senator O'Mahoney promptly invited his correspondent to Washington and let him confront GM President Harlow H. Curtice and thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been warned , Yager said , that his testimony might mean business suicide . Nevertheless , he minced no words in telling Senators what he thought of the company that made his cars . After years of developing a reliable dealer body under the leadership of Alfred P. Sloan , he testified , GM suddenly became a booster of " razzle dazzle carnival huckster " merchandising techniques . He accused GM personnel of urging him and dealers like him to " pack " prices . He said the factory had given its tacit approval to misleading advertising , and he denounced its agents for using a " gun-in-the-ribs " approach in forcing dealers to take more cars . Yager 's last charge was echoed by thousands of retailers selling all makes of cars . When the Senate auto-marketing questionnaire asked dealers to check the primary cause of new-car bootlegging to supermarkets , 13,581 checked " overproduction , " and another 10,992 marked " pressure from factory to take more cars . " Some Senators could n't understand why dealers bothered to purchase cars from their manufacturers if they could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We were driven by fear , " he said , " fear of being put out of business by our factories tomorrow . " There was good reason to be frightened . First of all , there are few manufacturers of passenger cars left . In the sixty-year history of the automobile , 2,600 different American makes have come and gone Three years ago , only seventeen remained , produced by nine corporations . This year , the number of makes has dropped to fifteen , produced by five industrial giants ? General Motors , Ford , Chrysler , American Motors , and Studebaker-Packard . Packard and Studebaker merged recently , as did Nash and Hudson to form American Motors . Kaiser and Willys combined , too , but dropped out of the passenger-car race last year to concentrate on utility vehicles . But that is n't the whole story of concentration . Of the five remaining car companies , the socalled Big Three ? GM , Ford , and Chrysler ? accounted for more than 95 per cent of the ' 55 production . General Motors alone made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these suppliers , he will have difficulty finding another . A dealer 's security , therefore , rests solely on his ability to keep one of these corporations happy . Unlike a member of the United Automobile Workers , he is an employer , not an employee . He invests his own capital , or the bank 's , in sales and service facilities in his home town , meeting rigid specifications laid down by his supplier . In return for this investment , which averages $100,000 among U. S. dealers , he receives permission to buy cars from his factory for cash . With few exceptions , the car sales which boosted GM 's net profit after taxes to one billion dollars last year were made only to independent dealers . Its up to the dealer to make his profit through sales to motorists . In theory , he buys only as many cars from his factory as he thinks he can profitably sell in his home town , and lets it go at that . But in testimony before two Senate committees , dealers said the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to retain the right to purchase cars at wholesale . This privilege is granted by each auto maker in the form of a selling agreement , or franchise . Until recently , whenever an auto factory felt that one of its dealers was falling down on the job , it could cancel its agreement with him on ninety days ' notice without specifying any cause for its action . In the case of General Motors , contracts ran for one year , and the factory could drop a retailer simply by failing to renew its agreement with him . Among most auto makers , such contracts are still the rule . As one Senator observed , the right to cancel dealers without cause helps manufacturers keep them in a state of economic serfdom . Needless to say , fcw would deny factories the right to choose the men they want to represent their products . But beginning in 1953 , dealers told Congress , the manufacturers ' termination privilege became a coercive weapon rather than a safeguard . In essence , retailers complained , they were ordered to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business . KEEP THE CARS MOVING I N THEIR sworn testimony before a special Senate subcommittee last spring , the dealers described the new sales system in detail . A New Hampshire Pontiac retailer , admitting he thought price packing was risky , said a factory agent had told him to add up to $212 to the prices of his cars . An ex-Mercury dealer from Reno testified that he was required to pad prices and to conduct cut-rate , " blitz " sales , confining his profit to the rebate on inflated finance and insurance charges . An ex-Chevrolet salesman said he was shipped cars that he had n't ordered , and was then pressured to keep them . When a Chicago Ford dealer protested doubling of his annual sales quota , he said he was told that he could sell his cars in Texas for all the factory cared , just so long as they were registered in Cook County , Illinois . He continued to protest , however , and was finally canceled . Letters from retailers who had tracked down the source of bootlegged cars went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its opposition to bootlegging . But one witness said there were seventeen cars of his make in a supermarket at a time when he could get no deliveries from his factory . One manufacturer , he said , actually requested a franchised outlet to send him a quota for bootleggers . The charges of coercion went on for days . Several witnesses claimed that divisions of Ford and GM had requested ? dealers to register cars falsely in the names of their relatives and employees , to help win the sales race for first place . One man complained he was forced to help buy elaborate gifts for retiring factory personnel , such as blooded palomino horses and diamond rings . A number said they were made to buy unwanted advertising materials from sources specified by the auto makers . Worst of all , in the opinion of many dealers , the treatment they received at the hands of their factories was degrading . Men who had been in the business for decades were now brushed off with curt notes from management . Oklahoma 's Senator A. S. Mike Monroney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read letters from factory sales executives to dealers that he would n't write to a criminal . Obviously , not all dealers were innocent of personal cupidity . Many admit that the business has always been somewhat piratical , and a sizable number of car buyers will never forget the gouging they took right after World War II when cars were in short supply . Certain retailers have been composing deceptive ads for years , and there has always been a little quiet bond eggi ng . But in the new era , unethical dealing was becoming the industry rule , not the exception . In the old days , a wise customer could avoid dealers with sloppy service and gyp reputations . Now it was getting hard to do . Dealers who assumed their own experience was the best barometer of market trends at home found they were invariably wrong . They were told to suspend their personal judgment , and to accept national sales quotas calculated in Detroit . The important thing was to keep cars moving . Those dealers who persisted in standing up for their rights as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way of retailing progress . That was infuriating . If packed prices , supermarkets , and nauseating advertising were what customers really wanted , many old-line dealers felt they conk ' beat the blitz artist at his own game . But they refused to believe that cars could be sold like cans of beans , especially since their factories continued to talk about their faith in the franchised dealer system . if there were going to be a major change in the method of distributing cars , most reliable retailers thought the auto makers should be the first to announce it . REWARD FOR LOYAL SERVICE A FE V who fought the Detroit treatment too hard found themselves out of business . " There is no mercy shown by any large automotive manufacturer when it comes to canceling a dealer 's contract , " scribbled one anonymous retailer on the back of his Senate questionnaire . The experience of J. Edgar Travis , Jr. , was a case in point . Until he was terminated in late 1955 , Travis had been a GM dealer for thirty-five years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Travis brought with him an engraved silver tray which Buick had once awarded him for his years of loyal service . In spite of this touching remembrance , however , he realized that he was in serious trouble with the factory in the fall of 1954 . At that time , Buick 's St. Louis zone manager presented hint with an addendum to his annual contract and asked hint to sign it . The addendum was a confession on Travis ' part that he was n't doing a proper selling job for his division . The retailer refused to sign . A month later he received his 1955 franchise with the addendum attached . Finding Travis uncooperative , the zone manager had signed it . Front that time on , Travis said he was subjected to continuous harassment by Buick . He was criticized for not finding enough things wrong with cars brought in for service . He was pushed to hire more salesmen . He was even rebuked for choosing an inappropriate time to attend a football game . But the division 's principal charge against him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough percentage of Buicks compared to sales of other makes in town . Travis contended that local registration figures were off about 28 per cent , due mainly to meddling by dealers in the bootlegging racket . Furthermore , he pointed out that St. Charles was a conservative town of only 14,000 , and lie thought it was absorbing all the new Buicks it could . The axe fell in June . Travis , who also sold Pontiaes and GMC Trucks , was told by zone managers for all three divisions that his franchises would terminate that fall because he had failed to become a volume salesman . He was " amazed . " Until that clay , he claimed , he had never heard a word of complaint from either Pontiac or GMC . Travis took his case to the top . His last court of appeal was the General Motors Dealer Relations Board , headed by Harlow Curtice . Travis said he argued his case doggedly until a chance remark of Curtice 's during the " trial " tipped him off that the case had been decided against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped with an expensive business and nothing to sell . The Travis affair aroused a tremendous amount of public sympathy . Missouri 's Senators Stuart Symington and Thomas Hennings and Representative Clarence Cannon testified from personal knowledge to the dealer 's reliability and high moral character . The Missouri Automobile Dealers Association , - in a formal resoluLion , denounced GAF- for the " shabby treatment " it had accorded Travis . Other victims of the 1955 purge followed Travis to the stand . A few days later , Curtice arrived in the Senate with his retinue of vice presidents . He was fighting mad . The statements made by dealers , he charged , had grossly misinformed the public . Blaming dealers for bootlegging and other evils , he appeared astounded at the suggestion that any of his field personnel were coercing retailers . He denied sending cars to dealers that they had n't ordered , and snapped that GM does not force unwanted merchandise on anybody . William F. Hufstader , GM 's vice president in charge of distribution , made specific reply to Travis . General Motors , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cancellation was simply a matter of good business . But Frederick J. Bell , head of the National Automobile Dealers Association , did n't think- it was good business at all , Continued factory pressure , he told Congress , had forced retailers into unwise and unsound practices , dangerous to the economy , to dealer profits , and to consumer confidence . The factories , he said , " have somehow classified their dealers as being part of an over-all system of automation , as not being flesh and blood people , but instruments to be controlled by pushbuttons . " By late spring , both Republican and Democratic support for dealers had snowballed . But the support of legislators , while impressive , was somewhat formless . Eager to gain favor with angry dealers back home , Congressmen dashed off bills hastily , paying little attention to possible effects on the industry . Some thirty measures were introduced , and Representative Abraham halter alone thought of eight different ideas to slow down auto makers . Many of the bills , had they become law , would have done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S U D D E N L Y , the tiger smiled . One by one , the presidents of the auto manufacturing companies filed before the auto marketing committee and admitted that they were ready to negotiate an armistice . In a startling switch from his bristling posture before the O'Mahoney group last fall , Curtice appeared contrite and candid . He told the Senate that he had started looking into the matter of car distribution problems right after-his first Congressional encounter . In what somedealers considered the understatement of the year , Curtice said that where there was so much smoke , he thought there might be a little fire . As a result of his personal investigation , he had just announced sweeping changes in GM 's selling agreement with dealers . Nearly every alteration was in favor of retailers , and they included giving dealers their choice of three different types of contracts . The practice of sending insulting " deficiency letters " had been halted . He even switched the head of Buick Division to a new post ? executive vice president in charge of dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtice accepted responsibility for most of the things he had previously denied . He confessed that " pressure froin competition " had caused him to condone price packing hi 1953 . He conceded that some GM divisional representatives had encouraged unethical advertising and bootlegging . Some dealers , he acknowledged , had been losing money , and dealer morale as a whole was very low . Curtice then pledged himself to do all in his power to put an end to price packing and misleading advertising among his dealers . Henry Ford II said lie , too , was firmly opposed to shady merchandising , and a Ford Motor executive said he was talking with dealers about franchise changes . In his testimony , Chrysler 's L. L. Colbert admitted he had erred in having too little contact with his dealers , but would correct that in the future . The present system is sound , he assured everybody , and there 's no real danger of the supermarkets ' taking over . On the whole , dealers were jubilant . It seemed to many that a little bad publicity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to equalize conditions between industrial giants and small retailers . There 's a good chance , too , that the management cadre , insulated in their bureaucracies from the day-to-clay problems of their salesmen , simply did n't know how much the production race was hurting them . Whatever the reason for Detroit 's change of heart , Congressmen were certain they had forced action by putting the factories in the public spotlight . But as layoffs and cutbacks this year have shown , the problems created by the 1955 production tour de force in the auto industry are not going to vanish overnight . Furthermore , there is nothing to stop factories from starting the cycle all over again when the time is ripe , with even more serious consequences . Had the current depression in Detroit hit our economy at a time when other industries were not quite so prosperous , the results might have been disastrous . Mike Monroney and Joseph O'Mahoney , the two Senators who conducted the long auto investigations , have kept this in mind . They know that the Detroit executives who granted dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure they do n't , they introduced two bills after most of the others had been tossed aside as impractical . ? The O'Mahoney bill , passed in June by the Senate by a seventy-five-to-one vote , would simply give auto retailers the right to sue their manufacturers in court in the event of capricious termination or intimidation . Complementing this measure , the Monroney bill sets down several ground rules for equitable dealings between retailers and suppliers . Among other things , it would make it an unfair trade practice for a factory to cancel a dealer for any reason not spelled out in its contract with him . It wouldalso prevent factories from coercing dealers into accepting unwanted merchandise of any sort . Early in June , chances for enactment of these measures looked slim . Nevertheless , the fact that they existed at all had a significance beyond an effect on one group of retailers . As long as even the chance remains for unfair pressure on local merchants , their status as independent small businessmen is little more than a myth . In dealing with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a union worker and are totally unable to perform the irreplaceable function of middleman in a market economy . As the best local experts on buying power and changing taste , dealers in all commodities serve as a necessary brake on excesses of production . They , better than anyone else , should know how many automobiles or anything else a community can absorb . But this important function of theirs is meaningless when , through coercion , they are denied the right to exercise it .
