In many a Deep South city , a mayor who addresses Negro gatherings as " Ladies and Gentlemen , " who puts Negroes on the police force and orders the Parks Department to let Negroes play golf on municipal courses , could be listed as a potential political suicide . Atlanta 's Mayor William Berry Hartsfield has done all these things-and many more like them . He ordered city employees to use " Dear Mr. Jones " instead of " Dear Jim " in answering letters from Negroes . In 1951 he approved of a national convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Atlanta , furnished a police honor escort from and to the airport for a visiting Negro dignitary , Diplomat Ralph Bunche . Last week , nevertheless , Bill Hartsfield , 67 , won his sixth term as mayor , narrowly beating out a rival for the Democratic nomination in Atlanta 's biggest mayoralty vote ( one-third Negro ) . In Georgia the Democratic primary victory means election . <P> Hartsfield keeps winning elections because of special qualities-both his and Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misses the chance to make a speech , once delighted his audience by conducting a symphony orchestra with a Confederate flag . He is also an able administrator who gets a lot of public works built and yet manages to keep his budgets balanced . Thriving Atlanta , thickly infiltrated with migrants from the North , is still a Jim Crow city , but is on the whole ashamed of the violent racial prejudice that is the stock in trade of such wool-hat-minded Georgia politicos as Herman Talmadge and Governor Marvin Griffin . The powerful editorial voice of the Atlanta Constitution ( circ. 192,520 ) does not hesitate to speak up for Negro rights , and it found no difficulty in backing Mayor Hartsfield for reelection . <P> Last week , besides endorsing Mayor Hartsfield , thousands of white Atlantans showed their independence in a citywide vote by voting for two Negro office seekers . Atlanta University 's longtime President Rufus Clement , 56 , beating out a white contender , was re-elected to the board of education , although the white-supremacy camp ( which argued that Clement won the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a Negro . Insurance Dealer Theodore Morton Alexander , 48 , first Negro to run for alderman in Atlanta since 1871 , finished a close second with two white candidates against him , stands an outside chance of winning a top-two runoff next week . After what he considered a moral victory , Alexander paid high tribute to Bill Hartsfield : " As I listened to the returns , my heart was beating faster for him than it was for me.
