" You answer it , " Cross said . " Jenny ! " a woman 's voice called through the door . " Yeah ? " Jenny answered , going to the door and opening it . A tall , fleshy blonde woman stood in the doorway with a bottle of whisky under her arm . " Hello , Ruth , " Jenny said . " What 's the matter ? " " Sorry . Did n't mean to disturb you , " the woman called Ruth said . Her eyes looked about the room , resting at last on Cross . " But Joe is n't here , is he ? " " No , honey , " Jenny said , shrugging . " I have n't seen him . " Ruth 's lips curled in scorn . " That black bastard 's run out on me , " she hissed . " If he 's dumped me without paying , I 'll kill him the next time I see him , so help me God ! But I do n't understand . . . . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll come back , " Jenny smiled . " He always does . " " He tried a new trick , " Ruth blazed . " He sent me down for a bottle of liquor and took a powder . " Ruth forced a smile for Cross . " I 'm sorry to bother you with my troubles . But , you know , the fool left his clothes behind . . . . You reckon he could be two-timing me ? Maybe he 's in some other room . . . ? " " Might be , " Jenny said , laughing at the possibility . " I 'll leave you now , " Ruth said , her eyes baffled . Jenny closed the door and turned to Cross , chuckling : " Ruth and her Joe . I do believe she 's in love with him , but he does n't give a damn about her . " " Who 's Joe ? " Cross asked listlessly . " A colored postal clerk who comes here all the time , " she told him as she sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pubic hair . " He 's Ruth 's star client ; he even keeps his bathrobe and slippers in her room . God , he 's a scream . Jet black , fat . . . A regular clown . . . Spends his money like water . . . Listen to this : He once told me . . . " Cross was not listening though his eyes were on her face . He was wondering how Joe 's body had fallen and where . . . . Had it landed on the street ? He wanted to open the window and look out , but he knew that would have aroused questions in Jenny 's mind . He had done a horrible thing ; he had killed so swiftly and brutally that he hardly recognized what he had done as he recalled it to his mind . ItP101was he who had made that assault on Joe in that room ; yes , he had done that to save himself . He heard Jenny laughing. . . do n't you think so ? " she was asking . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're not even listening ! " she said angrily . " At least Joe 's a good sport ! " " Well , go to him , " Cross told her , relishing his irony . If Joe 's body had landed on the street in the snow , then it would soon be seen by someone and there would be an outcry . But maybe it had dropped into a deep drift ? He was excited by such a prospect . If that had happened , no one would see it for a while . . . . He blinked when Jenny rose from the bed and came to him ; she caught his hand and pulled him to his feet . Gently , she forced him to the bed , climbed in with him and drew the covers over them . " Charlie , what 's the matter ? " she asked in a whisper . " Talk to me ... Maybe at any moment now a knock would come at the door and it would be about Joe . He heard footsteps pass in the corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Joe . . . . He had had no choice ; it had been either he or Joe . He had known it the moment he had looked into that fat , black , laughing face . " Your body is trembling , " Jenny whispered . " I wish I could help you ! " She was getting on his nerves . Why did n't she leave ... ? " You 're always watching me , questioning me , " he complained in a distant voice . " You 're too goddamn suspicious ! " she cursed him . He looked at her ; there was an animal-like quality in her that made him like her , and that quality showed most clearly when she was angry . " Okay , baby , spill your story , " he consented . " You 've been wanting to talk to me . Now , I 'm listening .... " He lifted himself on an elbow , his eyes on her face , but he was really seeking over the snowdrifts outside , looking for Joe 's body . " You sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger vanishing . " I 'll try  --  Look , Charlie , you 're black and I 'm white  --  That 's what this goddamn country says , but it 's the bunk , and you know it and I know it . They say it to keep us apart , do n't they ? " He nodded , not quite understanding what she had said . Maybe heP102had made a mistake in killing Joe like that . . . ? God , he had planned to be free , and now he had killed ... . ... I 'd bet a million dollars that I 've lived a much harder life than you have . I grew up in the slums of a small rotten town in the middle of Kansas . My father was a drunkard and a socialist of a sort .... " He was conscious that the more she talked the better she talked .

" He was looking at her , but was wondering what the police would say about finding Joe 's body clad only in a bathrobe ... . .... and I spotted you as an educated guy after you 'd said only two words . I respect education . . . . It 's too late for me to get one now , I reckon . But I want one ; really , I do .

But I know now . And how ! You 're listening , are n't you ? You 're not bored ? " " Oh , no ; go ahead , " he said ; he might be lost already . It was good that he had his gnu ; if the police found out about him , well , he would blow his brains out ... . " ... and when I got knocked up , the whole town knew it .

He raped me .... " He wondered why she felt so deep a sense of inferiority ; he was black , but he had never felt that humble in the face of life . And Joe ? Maybe the sirens would start howling soon ... ? " ... sounds crazy , hunh ? But I 'm not asking for sympathy . The hell with it . I 'm young . I 'll fight , work . Now , why am I telling you all this ? You said you were going west , did n't you ? I want to go to California  --  " " Movies ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Cross studied her face ; she was much prettier than she thought . " Then why California ? " " I just like the sunshine and want to be as far from Kansas and my family as I can get , " she said . " Take me with you , wo n't you ? I could be of some use , could n't I ? I do n't care if you 're colored . The hell with that crap  --  " " Jenny , " he began . " It wo n't work  --  " " Why not ? You can trust me . " " But my life  --  No . It wo n't work at all . " " I do n't give a good goddamn what you 've done , " she said . Cross smiled ruefully . She does n't know what she 's saying ... . " Look , baby , I like you . I believe you . But forget it , honey . It 's too complicated to explain . " She stood and her face grew red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something to keep her quiet ? Was she going t o threaten him and make him take her with him ? " Why am I so different ? " she demanded . " Do you loathe me ? What 's wrong with me . . . ? " Tears welled in her eyes . " Only last week Pearl Bland got a ride to New York with a guy with dough , " she said bitterly . " Me ? I ca n't even get a Negro to trust me ! " Shebent to him and asked : " Why ? Tell me why .... " " Come here , jenny , " he said . He folded her in his arms . Good God , this child was bitter ! In despair she began kissing him with passion , still weeping . He relaxed . Why not let her make him forget ? He could not control the flow of events now anyway ; he was probably already lost . . . . AnyP104minute the cops would be knocking on the door . What did he have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time he knew that she was allowing herself to be more of a woman because she wanted his trust . When the spasm was over he lay with his hand gently touching her face , mutely thanking her for the benediction that she had shed upon his distraught senses . " Darling , what 's your real name ? " she asked him quietly . The respite was over ; he felt danger again . He had to shake this girl off him quickly . But , what about Joe ? He had pushed Joe out of that window and time had flowed on as though nothing had happened . No one here knew his name or that he had known Joe . So , when they found Joe 's body , there would be no thought of him in connection with the death . They might even think that Ruth had done it . He lay still , plotting . He would not hurt jenny ; killing her would be a sure way of putting the police on his trail . He would fool her and ditch her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; agree to take her , dump her at the last moment , and strike out for New York alone . Cunning was better than violence ; he must not allow himself to be confronted again with the unexpected , as he had been with Joe ... . " You really want to come with me ? " Her arms tightened about his neck in gratitude . " Where 're we going ? " she asked . " We 'll take a bus to Denver , then later we 'll go to the Far West , " he said . " But we have to have dough . How much have you got ? " " Leave that to me , " he said . " I 'll get you to the West Coast , if you want to go . " " When do we leave ? " " Tonight . " He rolled swiftly from the bed and began washing up . " I 'll go down for the tickets now . " " I 'll believe it when I see those tickets , " she said , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told her . " How much luggage have you got ? " " Just a suitcase . " She studied him , then rubbed her fingers together . " I need some nylons and things .... " He gave her ten dollars . " Aw , come on , " she exploded . " Be a sport . "   " I 'll give you more tomorrow , " he said . " Now , go . " He pushed her out of the door , looked both ways in the corridor , then shut the door and locked it . He hurried to the window and opened it . A clear night sky sent a sheen over the snow-blown world . He stared down , searching for Joe 's body . Ah ... There it was , on that roof ! He could see it lying straight out , a black mark on the white snow . The soft snow had no doubt cushioned its fall and the impact of the body on the roof had not been heard . He had time to get away before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of the room . Why had that damn fool come on him at that time ? But he could not think of Joe now ; he had to plan how to ditch Jenny ... . He rode down in the elevator with Buck , who was grumbling : " Jesus ! Why ca n't that bitch leave me alone ? " He spoke to no one in particular . " She keeps yapping at me about Joe , Joe . . . . What the hell do I care about Joe ? It ai n't my job to keep track of her damn men ! These whores make me sick . Let a bobby pin get lost , and they come running to me . " " Do n't let ' em break you down , " Cross told him . " You damn right I wo n't , " Buck seethed with anger . " I do n't do my day 's work at night , like they do , flat on their backs . Man , a woman 'd make a man jump out of a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on legs he did not feel . He knew that Buck knew nothing about how Joe had died , but his talking of jumping from a window had almost paralyzed him . His body was seized with a chill and he felt so weak that he went into an alleyway and sank down upon an empty wooden soda-water case under the spreading glare of a street lamp . He started when a door opened and an aproned man came out with a garbage can and dumped its contents near him ; the man glanced curiously at Cross , then went hack inside , slamming the door and bolting it securely . Cross rested his wrists on his knees and his eyes traveled without purpose over the steaming pile of refuse , the top of which was crowned with a mound of wet , black coffee grounds that gleamed in the light of the street lamp ; some of the grounds spilled over a flattened grapefruit hull ; there was part of a fried sausage with grease congealed white in the porous grains of meat ; there was the crumpled cellophane wrapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture ; there was an electric bulb still holding its delicate filigreed web of wires even though its glass globe had been shat/tered ; there was a bone from a piece of roast beef still holding traces of red and gray meat ; there was a lemon ring molded to a light green color ; there was a clump of cigarette butts whose ends were blackened and whose tips were stained red from the rouge of a woman 's lips ; there was a limp wad of lettuce whose leaves glistened with a fine film of oil ; there was a clean piece of wood jutting out with a shining nail bent at the end of it ; there were several eggshells showing bits of yellow yolk ; there was the stump of a cigar bearing the marks of a man 's teeth ; and there was a clump of fluffy dust freshly gathered from some floor ... . His blood felt chilled . He had to shake off this dead weight and move on . He pulled to his feet and took a cab to La Salle Street Railroad Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you any sleeping accommodations for New York ? " " For tonight ? " the clerk asked . " For the earliest possible train , " Cross said . " Just a minute , " the clerk said . Cross waited nervously while the clerk telephoned . " We have one , a compartment , " the clerk informed him . " Okay . Fix it up . When does the train leave ? " " At six on track eight , sir . " He paid , received the tickets , then rushed by cab to the GreyhoundBus Terminal and bought two tickets to Denver . Back in the hotel , Jenny was waiting for him at the door of his room . She smiled warmly , but there was nervousness in her manner . When they were inside , he handed her her ticket for the bus . " Where 's your ticket ? " she asked suspiciously . " Here , " he said , showing it to her . He had thought that she would ask that ; it was why he had bought two tickets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his insurance that she would believe in him long enough for him to take the six o'clock train to New York . " You know where the Greyhound Bus Terminal is ? " he asked . " Sure . " " The bus leaves at eight . I 've got to see some people ; I 'll be gone about an hour . " He looked at his watch . " It 's five now . I 'll be back at six . We 'll eat and then we 're off . " She seemed satisfied with his story and he left her . He got into a cab and rode over to the La Salle Street Railroad Station . A porterP107guided him to his coach . He showed his reservation and ticket to the conductor , got on , and , when he was in his compartment , he locked the door . He cursed softly : That damn fool Joe . . . ! And Jenny did not know how lucky she was . From now on he had to cope with this impulseof his to confide . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to kill Jenny too , or give up the game . He had thought he was free . But was he ? He was free from everything but himself . Loneliness had driven him to confess to Jenny , and fear could have made him kill her as he had killed Joe . He kept his fists tightly clenched as he waited impatiently for the train to pull out . At last he heard the distant calling : " Alll aboooooard ! " He stood at the window as the train began to move . A light snow was falling softly . Two hours from now Jenny would be searchingfrantically for him at the bus station . And she would never know that he had done her the greatest favor of her life . But what was he to do with this conflict of his ? This urge to confide and the fear of the danger of confiding ? The outside world had fallen away from him now and he was alone at the center of the world of the laws of his own feelings . And what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed before his window ; it was a dim , dead , dumb , sleeping city wrapped in a dream , a dream born of his frozen impulses . Could he awaken this world from its sleep ? He recalled that pile of steaming garbage , the refuse the world had rejected ; and he had rejected himself and was bowed , like that heap of garbage , under the weight of endurance and time . As the train wheels clicked through the winter night , he knew where his sense of dread came from ; it was from within himself , within the vast and mysterious world that was his and his alone , and yet not really known to him , a world that was his own and yet unknown . And it was into this strange but familiar world that he was now plunging ... .  |p108The  mirage of desire that he had sought so pathetically was still his to mull over in regretful recollection . In breaking his life in two he had left his baffled mother to fend for herself as best she could , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , out of her life 's hysteria , conferred upon him in his childhood , was still his beyond his right to surrender . More definitely than ever her fateful gift was shaping and toning his hours even now on this fleeing train , was subtly sculpturing the contoursof his destiny , staining all the future that he was to embrace even to that lonely grave which he would some day have to fill alone . Being quit of Gladys was infinitely more than shedding a vindictivewife ; it meant insight into those quicksands of appalling lonelinessthat had sucked him into her waiting arms in the first place . He did not remember her in a way that made him yearn to return to her ; his memory assumed the form of an intense appropriation of that intimate part of himself which had seduced him into embracing her , and toward that part of his being he had now a change of heart  --  he wanted never again to seek fulfillment of desire in that direction . He was , however , far from being resigned ; an urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His sorrow for Dot , his mother , and Gladys originated in his knowing that they had hoped for something from him which he did not possess ; his pity for them was his knowledge of himself , a regret for ever having allowed them to build their dreams upon the mercurial instabilities of his emotions . His memory of Joe 's death was simpler . His killing of Joe had been dictated by his fear of exposure , and he knew that what had happened with Joe could happen again under conditions he could n't control . Given a situation of danger and the dreaded tension that went with it , his impulse to save himself would sweep him toward what horizons ? He knew that his being able to reflect coolly upon this did not mean that he was free of it , that to see was not to control , that self-understanding was far short of self-mastery . He was afraid of himself . Had they discovered Joe 's body yet ? Or would that snowdrift on the roof hide it for a few days longer ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had no real fear of ever being accused of killing Joe , for his relation to Joe had been twice removedP111and no apparent motive for his having killed him could be easily deduced . For days the Chicago police would no doubt sniff about aimlessly in the hotel corridors , accusing first this whore and that , and , in the end , they would probably mark it down either as suicide or death at the hands of parties unknown .... Or maybe they 'd conclude that his death had been accidental ... ? The next morning , as the train neared New York , he made his way apprehensively into the dining car for breakfast . He was afraid that his preoccupation with his burden of nonidentity and his fear of sudden surprises would distract him to the point of robbing reality of its naturalness and innocence . The serried white faces floating above the tables about him were signs whose meanings he had to decipher in terms of wondering if they suspected him . Or could he find with them some basis for a relationship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , he looked about for the waiter . Coming from the front of the dining car , grinning broadly , holding aloft in his right palm a tray of steaming food , was a short , nervous , brown-skinned man who winked smilingly at Cross and kept on looking at him as he passed . The waiter had given him an innocent , racially fraternal greeting common among Negroes . Cross knew that most whites never dreamed that their behavior toward Negroes had bred in them , especially when they were in the presence of whites , a defensive solidarity that had , except for latent white hostility , no valid reason for being . He idly observed the waiter'smovements as the brown hand deftly placed succulent dishes under the impassive faces of whites . Having emptied his tray , the waiter turned , paused at Cross 's table , dusted his napkin at imaginary bread crumbs on the white table cloth , and whispered : " How you , guy ? " " Fine , " Cross answered . " And you ? " " Just dragging my black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiter said in a sniggling whisper . " Be with you in a sec . I 'm the only waiter in this car . My pal took sick and got off in Cleveland . So I got my hands full of white shit . " The waiter clapped his hands over his mouth and widened his eyes at Cross in a sign-language laugh . " Take your time , " Cross told him . " I 'm in no hurry . " " Wish these white monkeys felt like you do , " the waiter whispered in appreciation . He handed Cross a folded newspaper . " Want the paper ? "  | " Thanks , " Cross mumbled . He gave Cross another wink and moved swiftly on between the crowded tables . Cross opened the paper and glanced at the headlines . Was there any news of Joe ? It was not until he had reached the bottom of page four that he saw a small caption : POSTAL CLERK 'S BODY FOUNDHe lowered the paper quickly , reading : The almost nude body of a Negro postal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence Avenue , was found dead early this morning on the near South Side by an emergency line repairman . The body was lying clad only in a bathrobe in a deep snowdrift atop the roof of a four-story dwelling . The victim had apparently been drunk and it has not been determined if Thomas leaped , was pushed , or died from exposure . That was all . Could they trace Joe 's death to him ? But how could they discover that he , Cross Damon , had been in the hotel ? He felt safe . He looked through the moisture-streaked window at the sunny fields of snow glittering and turning slowly outside . The train rumbledon , clicking wheels of steel . Ice-encrusted telegraph wires shot past , rising and dipping like strings plucked by invisible fingers . It was a normal world whose events flowed intelligibly and each object had a sharp , precise meaning . He looked in the direction of the waiter and was surprised to see the waiter looking at him , winking , smiling ... Out of a void , anxiety rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dining car falling away as his consciousness projectedmenacing meanings on the look of the world . Was he being followed on this train ? Was n't that waiter being especially friendly to allay any fears he might have that he was being watched ? Had n't that waiter cursed the white folks with the idea of inducing in him a false notion of security ? He had no objective evidence that anything extraordinary was happening in the dining car , but this rational perception did n't down his fear . Why was that tall white man staring at him ? And why had he looked off when their eyes met ? In vain his mind protested this delusive mood that was stealing his sanity away . . . . Passing to get another tray of food , the waiter again paused atP113Cross 's table , grinning , whispering : " These white bastards think they 're smart , hunh ? But one of these days we 'll show ' em , wo n't we , boy ? " The waiter knew and was teasing him ! He had spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could joke about it ! Cross blinked and fought to control the sensations of his body ; he had the illusion of something crawling over the surface of his skin . When the waiter finally came to take his order , he was so confused that he kept his eyes on the menu and mumbled what he wanted to eat . He was conscious of the irrational nature of what was transpiring , but lie could not master it . His sensibilities clamored to believe in this delusion ; his emotions needed the certainty of this transparent fantasy ; yet , in the end , his mind was tough enough to cling to its anchoragein the hard ambiguities of normal reality . When his bacon and eggs came , he had no desire to eat . But would not that make him conspicuous ? He picked up his knife and fork and forced himself , praying for this spell to pass . He was loading his fork with a bit of bacon and a part of egg yolk when a stretch of black cloth appeared before him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy , florid of face , and with a white , turned-about collar . " Good morning , " the priest said , smiling . " Good morning , " Cross answered . The priest sat down , then nodded toward the white landscape . " We 've had a lot of snow . " " Yes . " " Did you sleep well ? " the priest asked . " Yes , " Cross lied . " I did n't , " the priest said . " I can never sleep on trains . By the way , do you live in Harlem ? " " Yes . " Why was he being so closely questioned ? The priest stared thoughtfully out of the window and Cross wondered what he was thinking . . . . He gripped his knife and fork hard . Goddamn ... He had to keep his head above this dangerous water and not go under . : the waiter passed , the priest caught hold of his arm and asked : May I keep this seat for my friend ? He 'll be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the waiter said and , when he was out of the range iii the vision of the priest , he made a grimace with his lips to Cross . P114Cross 's anxieties now condensed themselves into an attitude of sullenness toward the priest . He disliked most strongly all men of religion because he felt that they could take for granted an interpretation of the world that his sense of life made impossible . The priest was secure and walked the earth with a divine mandate , while Cross 's mere breathing was an act of audacity , a confounding wonderat the daily mystery of himself . He felt that the attitude of the priest was predicated upon a scheme of good and evil ordained by a God whom he was constrained out of love and fear to obey ; and Cross therefore regarded him as a kind of dressed-up savage intimidatedby totems and taboos that differed in kind but not in degree from those of the most primitive of peoples . Cross had to discover what was good or evil through his own actions , which were more exacting than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had to bear the brunt of their consequences with a sense of absolutenessmade intolerable by knowing that this life of his was all he had and would ever have . For him there was no grace or mercy if he failed . The waiter paused with a loaded tray at his table and said : " I 'll be serving your coffee , next . " " Good , " Cross mumbled . He saw the waiter bend with a dead-pan face to serve a white woman who sat across the aisle from him . " I 'm sorry I had to make you wait , Ma 'm , " the waiter mumbled . Cross watched the waiter place a tumbler of orange juice before the woman , then a platter of ham and poached eggs . The waiter was about to lift a silver pot of steaming coffee to fill her cup when the woman turned abruptly with her whole body , opening her mouth to speak . Cross saw the woman 's plump , naked elbow describe a tiny , swift arc and collide with the coffeepot as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metal and a brown spout of boiling coffee , emittinga cloud of vapor , splashed over the woman 's bare arm and onto her bosom . The waiter 's movements froze and the woman leaped to her feet and screamed , her face distorted with fury and pain. s " You nigger , you 're burning me ! " she yelled . The waiter stood paralyzed , his mouth open . The woman 's frantic eyes swept the dining car , then rested upon the table . In one flowing movement , she seized the handle of a silver water pitcher and raised it above her head , her eyes bulging and her darkly rouged lips curled in pain . P115Cross was on his feet before he knew it and had traversed the aisle and was standing between the woman and the waiter , fronting the woman , blocking her action with his uplifted right hand , which still clutched his napkin . The woman lowered her hand . " You 're not hitting me , nigger , " the woman said quietly . " You 're not hitting anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the woman , put his arm about her , then looked from Cross to the waiter . The dining car was full of the rumble of the train speeding over steel rails . In the middle of the car a tall , hard-faced man stood up and glared . " What 's the matter down there ? " the man called . " I 'm sorry , lady , " the waiter crooned in humility . The woman pawed at her arm , which gleamed a brick red where the coffee had scalded it . Steam still rose from her dress . She began to weep . " I got something for that burn , Ma 'm , " the waiter found his tongue and ran toward the rear of the car . The tall , hard-faced man rushed to the side of the priest and now two men were holding the woman and looking at Cross . Cross 's hand fell to his side . He was surprised to find that he was smiling ; he had acted before he had known it . Another white woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Darling , I 've got something in my purse for burns , " the woman said and led her from sight , toward the women 's lavatory . The waiter came running with a tube of salve and stood staring helplessly at the backs of the two retreating women . " It was n't my fault , " he said , looking at the silent , thoughtful faces in the car . " She turned round  --  like this . " He imitated the woman 's movement . " And she knocked the pot out of my hand . " The train whistled a long , mournful blast and Cross could feel the centrifugal pull of its speed as it struck a stretch of curving track . lie went to his seat and sat before his half-empty plate and stared out the window . Low voices were murmuring in the car . " It 's a shame  --  Was she burnt badly ? " " But I saw her ; she knocked the pot out of his hand ... " What happened ? Did somebody hit the woman ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't the waiter 's fault . " Cross became aware that the priest had also sat and was staring at him ; when their eyes met , the priest looked off toward the snowfilledfields . Cross realized that he had sprung without thinking toP116his feet to block the woman 's tossing the pitcher into the waiter 's face and he knew that the priest had leaped up to defend the woman . Both of them had acted before they had been fully conscious of what they had wanted to do . And now shame made them avoid each other 's eyes . " It 's a strange world , is n't it ? " Cross asked the priest softly . The priest ruefully smiled his answer and nibbled thoughtfully at a slice of buttered toast . The injured woman came briskly down the aisle with lips pursed and eyes glazed . The other woman followed . " I 'm going to report you , " she told the waiter . The waiter paused , stared , his lips hanging open in dismay . He shook his head and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was n't my fault , Ma 'm . " It was a plea issuing from a soul that hated its shame and humility . " You were careless and I 'm going to sue , " the woman said . She tossed her blond hair and flounced out of the car . The waiter 's face was a mask of distress and Cross chided himself upon ever having thought that he could have been spying on him . " Oh , there you are ! " a sonorous voice came from a hunchbacked man who slid into the seat beside the priest . " What kept you ? " the priest asked . " I went in the wrong direction looking for the diner , " the man said , laughing and letting his eyes settle upon Cross 's face . Suddenly the priest beamed at Cross and spoke : " By the way , I 'm Father Seldon and my friend here is District Attorney Ely Houston of New York City . " " How do you do ? " Cross asked , full of fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ely Houston of whom he had heard ? The celebrated crime-buster ? At once his tensions began to deform the look of the world . Though the two white faces regarded him with friendliness , he projected on them an air of the sinister . Maybe the Chicago police had wired ahead and Houston had gotten on the train to apprehend him ? How had they come to seat themselves exactly at his table ? And he recalled that the priest had expressly asked the waiter to save the chair next to him for Houston . . . . Was Houston armed ? He imagined he could see a slight bulge under thep117man 's right armpit and he mentally pictured a gun nestling there ... . " You live in New York ? " Houston asked . " Yes . " Could this be a trap ? He did not volunteer to tell his name and they did not ask him to do so . Would they think it odd that he had not identified himself ? " Mr. Houston and I are very much interested in your people , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priest meant , but he allowed his eyebrows to lift in surprise . He did not want to be drawn into any discussion with them , yet he did not want to make them feel that he was afraid . " My people ? What do you mean ? " Father Seldon chewed industriously upon his mouthful of bacon and eggs and kept his eyes on his plate , answering : " I mean the colored people  --  " " Oh , " Cross said , giving a play-acting laugh . " But they were born that color . Nobody colored them . " Houston and the priest were startled for a moment , then both of them laughed . Houston continued to examine Cross in a friendly manner ; finally he nodded his head affirmatively . " That 's good . I must remember it , " Houston said . " Well , Ely , " Father Seldon said , turning and smiling at Houston , " if you should ever run for the Senate , you 'd know how not to make a mistake before an audience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted . Cross was through eating and he wanted to go back to his compartment . But he must not act too fast and arouse unnecessary suspicions . He lingered on , studying Houston closely . The man had a huge head of remarkably black , unruly hair ; a long , strong , too white Bice ; clear , wide-apart brown eyes ; and a well-shaped mouth that held always a hint of a smile at its corners . His shoulders were I lerculean with long arms that terminated in huge hands with delicatelystrong fingers . The hump on the back was prominent but riot as noticeable as Cross would have thought it would be , so ilaturally did it blend in with the man 's general build . Cross had not particularly noticed this deformity when Houston had first sat down , but now he remembered that Houston had moved forward to theP118table with a motion that slightly resembled that of a creeping animal , holding his trunk still as he walked . He reminded Cross of a patiently waiting , giant white spider whose temper was never ruffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had the impression of a man possessing stealthy reserves of physical and emotional strength , and he felt intuitively that this was exactly the kind of man whom he had to fear not only because he was a defender of the law , but because Houston had an ability to delve into life . He was afraid of this man and yet his fear made him want to know him . " Where 's your parish , Father ? " Cross asked . " In Harlem , " Father Seldon said , obviously glad to speak of it . " We also operate a school for delinquent boys in Upstate New York . Maybe you 've heard of it ? The Sanctuary it 's called . We have about sixty Negro boys up there now . " " I see , " Cross said . Houston dawdled his fork in his plate and spoke in a tone that made Cross know that he was expressing thoughts of deep interest to himself , thoughts touched and lighted by passion , almost . " I 'm profoundly interested in the psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Only a few people see and understand the complexity of this problem . And do n't think that my interest is solely political . It 's not ; it was there long before I ever thought of entering politics . " He smiled cryptically and let his eyes wander over the icy landscape flowing past the train 's window . " My personal situation in life has given me a vantage point from which I 've gained some insight into the problems of other excluded people . " Cross 's impulses were at war . Was Houston raising the question of the Negro to mislead him before he was told that he was under arrest ? Why did n't he come right out with what he wanted ? He had a foolish desire to reach forward and grab Houston 's shoulder and say to him : All right ; I know you 're after me . . . . Let 's get it over with . . . . His stomach muscles tightened as he checked himself . He knew that Houston , in identifying himself with Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring himself to be an outsider like Cross and Cross was interested , but he kept his face passive to conceal it . " The way Negroes were transported to this country and sold into slavery , then stripped of their tribal culture and held in bondage ; P119and then allowed , so teasingly and over so long a period of time , to be sucked into our way of life is something which resembles the rise of all men from whatever it was we all came from , " Houston said , the smile on his lips playful and knowing . " I follow you , " Cross said . " Yes ; I see you do . " Houston smiled with satisfaction . " We are not now keeping the Negro on such a short chain and they are slowly entering into our culture . But that is not the end of this problem . It is the beginning . . . . " " What do you mean , Ely ? " Father Seldon asked . " I mean this , " Houston hastened to explain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inherit the problems we have , but with a difference . They are outsiders and they are going to know that they have these problems . They are going to be self-conscious ; they are going to be gifted with a double vision , for , being Negroes , they are going to be both inside and outside of our culture at the same time . Every emotional and cultural convulsion that ever shook the heart and soul of Western man will shake them . Negroes will develop unique and specially defined psychological types . They will become psychological men , like the Jews . . . . They will not only be Americans or Negroes ; they will be centers of knowing , so to speak . ... The political , social , and psychological consequences of this will be enormous .... " " You are much too complicated , Ely , " Father Seldon said . " The problem 's bad enough without trying to make it into everything . All the colored people need is the right to jobs and living space . " " True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things is so long and drawn out that they must , while they wait , adjust themselves to living in a kind of No Man 's Land . . . . Now , imagine a man inclined to think , to probe , to ask questions . Why , he 'd be in a wonderful position to do so , would he not , if he were black and lived in America ? A dreadful objectivity would be forced upon him . " " Oh , Ely , you 're always climbing some rocky goat track of speculation , " Father Seldon protested . " Take the simple facts of life just as they are found  --  " " That 's what I 'm doing , " Houston said . " And when you look at them closely , those simple facts turn out to be not so simple . " " I think Mr. Houston 's close to the truth , " Cross said , pretending a smile , relishing an irony that came from referring both to his ownp120feelings that maybe Houston was trying to track him down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem really starts once the Negro gets his so-called rights . Is he going to be able to settle down and live the normal , day-to-day life of the average white American ? Or will he still have his sense of outsidedness ? " " Right , " Houston agreed by stabbing the air with his fork . " You 've got it . Say , where did you go to school ? Not that you learn things like that in school .... " " Fisk , " Cross lied . He rose ; this was getting too close . " I 'm sorry , gentlemen . " Cross smiled at them . " But I must leave . It 's wonderful to talk like this . " " Well , sit down and talk , " Houston said . " No ; really , I must go . I 've a lot to do , " Cross lied vaguely . " Good morning . " He made his way nervously out of the dining car . Goddamn . . . . He was frightened of that hunchback , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crammed with guilty knowledge . What weird luck to encounter a kindred type to whom he wanted to talk and who wanted to talk to him . And this would be his life until he found himself an identity behind which he could hide . The Pullman porter had made up his bed and he was alone ; he sat and stared moodily out the window . He who had a secret to hide loved talking ! When one tried to conceal oneself , did n't one make oneself conspicuous ? And that seductive fear that always surged up in him , how was he to handle it ? And why did he always yearn to embrace those delusive fantasies ? What unearthly greed made him want to feed upon what he knew to be unreal ? He could run away from Dot , Gladys , his mother , but he could not run away from this ; it was he and he was it . A tapping came at the door and he rose in dread , his lips parting . Was it Houston ? The tapping sounded again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it was the waiter , holding a scared smile on his lips . " Hello , " Cross said , relieved . " Can I speak to you a minute ? " " Sure ; come on in . " The waiter came hesitantly into the compartment . " Man , that bitch is raising hell , " the waiter began . " She 's gon na sue the company for damages , and she 's saying it 's all my fault . If she wins , it 's my job . " The waiter 's eyes danced in his head .   " What 're you going to do ? " Cross asked . " I got to get some witnesses , " the waiter said . " You know , that priest wo n't witness for me . Can you feature that ? Man , what can we do with these white folks ? " He spoke in a low , nervous tone of voice charged with bitterness . " I 'm gon na take it up with the union ; they 'll fight for me . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , " Cross said . " My name 's Bob Hunter , " the waiter said . Cross knew that Hunter was waiting for him to give his name . " Mine 's Addison Jordan , " Cross said , feeling that he was speaking out of a dream . " Would you be a witness if that bitch makes trouble ? " " Sure , " Cross said , beginning to hate the man . " Give me your address and the union 'll get in touch with you , " Hunter said , taking a frayed address book from his pocket . " It 's 128 West 137th Street , " Cross lied , never again wanting to look into Hunter 's eyes . He could not explain his unavailability to this man , yet it was wrong to allow him to think that he had his help . " Thanks , " Hunter said , jotting down the address . " You do n't live so far from me . Here ; take my address . " He wrote it on a slip of paper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can kill a bottle , hunh ? " " Sure , " Cross agreed . Hunter made him feel his impotence so keenly that he wanted tospit in his face . Hunter 's manner of pronouncing certain words botheredCross and Cross asked him : " Where were you born , Hunter ? " " Texas , man , " Hunter said , eying Cross closely . " Why ? " " I do n't know . Just curious , that 's all . " " Say , you need any help with your bags ? " Hunter asked . " Oh , no , " Cross said . " I 've only one suitcase . " " Just want to help you , man , " Hunter smiled . " We colored folks got to stick together , do n't we ? " " Oh , yes , " Cross agreed with pretended heartiness . " Good-by , now , " Hunter said , leaving and closing the door . Christ Almighty ! Hunter was believing that he had his help , that he would be a friend . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as he had made his mother , his sons , Dot , Gladys , and Jenny promises that he could not keep . . . . His nonidentity wasP122making Hunter believe in the unreal . Cross sighed . He had to break out of this dream , or he would surely go mad . He had to be born again , come anew into the world . To live amidst others without an identity was intolerable . In a strict sense he was not really in the world ; he was haunting it , pleading for entrance into life . . . . He sat and rested his head in his hands . He must eventually find Bob Hunter and try to square this deception . But why did he care about Bob Hunter ? No ; it was not Hunter himself that bothered him ; it was Hunter 's delusive belief in him that he found offensive . He started as another knock came . Hunter again ? If so , he 'd explain to the man that he could not help him . He rose and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I ? " Houston asked him , smiling . " Oh , no , " Cross lied . His body seemed suddenly made of soft , melting wax . " Come in . " " Are you sure ? I just wanted to talk a little , " Houston said . Houston 's manner seemed sincere . Maybe he was wrong ? As he talked to Houston , he would be waiting for the trap to be sprung . Houston sat and held out his pack of cigarettes . Cross took one and Houston held his lighter . Cross strove for nonchalance , meeting Houston 's gaze with a smile . Houston studied Cross for some minutes . Why in hell does n't he speak ... ? " It 's not often that one meets someone who can grasp ideas , " Houston began . " If I 'm bothering you now , it 's a little of your own fault ; you ought not to have agreed with me in the dining car . " Houston laughed . " You know , to get to the point , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to . There 's something about the Negro in America that almost hypnotizes me , really .... By the way , quite frankly , talking about this problem does n't bother you , does it ? " " Not at all , " Cross said , in spite of his anxiety . " People are so tender-skinned these days , " Houston went on . " Everybody 's trying to be other than what they really are : something official , approved of , safe  --  " " They are afraid , " Cross said , suppressing his own fear . " You strike me as being a man of pretty cool judgment and having some insight into life , " Houston said . Cross wanted to laugh out loud . If the man only knew how lost and guilty and scared he was ! How steeped in anxiety ! " I do n't know , " Cross said.  | " Whenever I 've tried to talk to most educated Negroes , I 've felt a barrier , " Houston continued . " I can understand why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation . And many whites do enjoy talking to Negroes about this problem ; it makes them feel superior and secure . " " That 's all too true , " Cross agreed . " But this hump on my back ought to give me some license , " Houston argued . " I know what it means to be an object outside of the normal lives of men . I know how it feels to be stared at , to have some silly woman want to touch your hump for luck . . . . When I was a child , I hated myself , cursed my ill fortune ; but now I 'd not want to give up what my peculiar situation has taught me about life . This damned hump has given me more psychological knowledgethan all the books I read at the university . " My deformity made me free ; it put me outside and made me feel as an outsider . It was n't pleasant ; hell , no . At first I felt inferior . But now I have to struggle with myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Do you understand what I mean ? " " I do , " Cross said quietly . " Some men are so placed in life by accident of race or birth or chance that what they see is terrifying , " Houston said , carried away by his theme . " Life converts the lives of such men into something almost dreamlike . And I 've often wondered why I could n't detect this feeling of the outsider in the Negroes I 've met . In America the Negro is outside . Our laws and practices see to it that he stays outside . . . . Or , am I mistaken in looking for this in Negroes , Mr. - ? " " Addison Jordan 's the name , " Cross lied , murmuring softly . Was Houston spying on him ? If he acted afraid , Houston would wonder why . The best policy would be to talk frankly , and when he spoke he was talking of himself , a self pushed away from him and described in abstract terms . " Yes , Mr. Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he hides it . He 's scared to reveal what he feels . He fears reprisals from his white neighbors . " Cross was feeling how much he was hiding from Houston . " But they ought to be able to talk to me without fear , " Houston said with a note of pleading in his voice . " After all , in a psychologicalsense , I 'm a brother to them . " " They 're even afraid of you , " Cross said , smiling , wondering if Houston too was being ironical.  |p124Cross  could feel that Houston sensed the quality of the demoniacal in him , and he could feel the same in Houston . But this man , of all men , must not get too close to him . He represented the law and the law condemned what he was and what he had done . Cross felt the hot breath of danger as Houston continued . " My position 's difficult , " he said . " I feel outside the lives of men . Yet my job demands that I enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How do you manage it ? " Cross asked with a constricted throat . Houston laughed and did not answer . " Do you have sympathy for those who break the laws of civilization ? " Cross felt compelled to ask . " In a way , yes , " Houston confessed . " But it all depends upon how the laws are broken . My greatest sympathy is for those who feel that they have a right to break the law . But do you know that there are not many criminals who feel that ? Most of them almost beg you to punish them . They would be lost without the law . The law 's vengeanceis what gives meaning to their lives . " Houston paused and stared at the floor . " You asked something about civilization ... . Civilization , " Houston repeated the word , letting it roll slowly on his tongue . He looked at Cross , smiled , then asked teasingly : " You call this civilization ? I do n't . This is a jungle . We pretend that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . We have imposed a visible order , but hidden under that veneer of order the jungle still seethes . " " But why do you call it a jungle ? " Cross asked . " Is n't it normal life and we 've tried to hide it with order because it 's too terrible , maybe ? " " Maybe , " Houston admitted . " Is n't life exactly what it ought to be , in a certain sense ? Is n't it only the naive who find all of this baffling ? If you 've a notion of what man 's heart is , would n't you say that maybe the whole effort of man on earth to build a civilization is simply man 's frantic attempt to hide himself from himself ? That there is a part of man that man wants to reject ? That man wants to keep from knowing what he is ? That he wants to protect himself from seeing that he is something awful ? And that this awful ' part of himself might not be as awful as he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know whatto do with it ? We talk about what to do with the atom bomb . . . But man 's heart , his spirit , is the deadliest thing in creation . Aren'tp125all cultures and civilizations just screens which men have used to divide themselves , to put between that part of themselves which they are afraid of and that part of themselves which they want to try to preserve ? Are n't all of man 's efforts at order an attempt to still man 's fear of himself ? " " And what is man that he has to hide from himself ? " Houston asked , smiling ; there was a look of frightened delight in his eyes . Involuntarily Cross drew in his breath and looked past Houston to the bleak landscape of snow sweeping past the train 's window . The conversation was making him feel a sense of intense isolation , and , even though Houston was there in the compartment with him , for a moment he was unaware of it . He was man who had killed and fled , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . " Maybe man is nothing in particular , " Cross said gropingly . " Maybe that 's the terror of it . Man may be just anything at all . And maybe man deep down suspects this , really knows this , kind of dreams that it is true ; but at the same time he does not want really to know it ? May not human life on this earth be a kind of frozen fear of man at what he could possibly be ? And every move he makes , could n't these moves be just to hide this awful fact ? To twist it into something which he feels would make him rest and breathe a little easier ? What man is is perhaps too much to be borne by man .... " Houston rose quickly ; there was intense excitement in his face and Cross grew afraid . Maybe he had talked too much ? " Maybe my theory is too wild , " Cross said with hasty self-deprecation . " No . I 've had the same notion and I ca n't get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " I knew that this existed ! By God , I knew that someday I 'd hear this from your side of the fence . The Negro has to know this . How could he escape knowing it ? He looks right at it every day of his life , every hour . . . . " Houston paused , smiled cynically . " All my life I 've been haunted by the notion that this life we live is a pretense , and all the more deadly because it is a pretense . And woe to the man who dares to try to reveal that pretense ! He is the criminal . . . . " He pulled deeply atis cigarette and laughed softly . " ' Man 's nothing in particular , ' " he repeated Cross 's words . " I think you 're pretty close to something there . Say , we seem to be getting into the city . . . . Look , here 's my card . Call me up sometime and we can chat a little , eh ? I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , rising and taking the card . " I 'd be glad to . " Houston left , smiling , seemingly satisfied . Alone , Cross sat again and stared unseeingly at the dreary apartment-building landscape of the Bronx as it heaved into view . Of one thing he was certain : he could never see Houston again . It was Houston 's job to bring him to justice . The man 's mind seemed to find its recreation by delving directly into problems of consciousness like those that were possessinghim . He felt like a bird veering and fluttering toward the wide , unblinking eyes of the crouching cat . . . . He had to master himself ; he had to steer clear of being always drawn toward that which he dreaded . And , intuitively , he knew that Houston was caught in the same psychological trap . That was why Houston was a District Attorneysworn to uphold a system of law in which he did not really believe . Houston was an impulsive criminal who protected himself against himself by hunting down other criminals ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced his emotional drives ! He could experience vicariously all destructive furies of the murderer , the thief , the sadist , without being held to accountability ! The train slowed and was passing 125th Street and Cross looked down at the wintry drabness of Harlem , at its rows of tenements , at black men and women huddled in overcoats , trudging through snowy streets . Well , here I am .... I 've made no promises .... I 'm nobody .... I 'm responsible for nothing . . . . He sighed as the train slid into the underground , making for Grand Central Station . Half an hour later , Cross , lugging his heavy suitcase , followed the crowd up the ramp toward the waiting rooms . As he edged forward his anxieties began to mount . Care seemed to bring him these compulsive moods which , when they first made their presence felt , when they first declared their emotional authority , were nothing definite . They simply rose seemingly out of nowhere and in defiance of his rational capacity and began seeking their own object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what was at hand , anything ... . Cross knew that this was himself acting , and that self was alien to him . He passed the train 's huge engine and longed to become as uncaringand passively brutish as that monster of steel . But , no ; his was to feel all of those anxieties in his shivering flesh . Goddamn ! To swap the burden of this sorry consciousness for something else ! To be a God who could master feeling ! If not that , then a towering rockP127that could feel nothing at all ! His life was becoming a tense prayer interspersed with curses . He wondered if the priest felt life as keenly as he did . Or had n't the priest become a priest precisely in order not to feel it ? Through the bars of the gate he saw crowds milling in the station ; porters rushed to and fro ; hand trucks piled with luggage rolled toward the exits ; he heard shouts of friends greeting friends . If his apprehensions were true , if Houston were playing a game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was out of the gate , he saw Houston and Father Seldon smiling and waving at him and he smiled and waved back . He was still safe . Twice before he had been in New York , with Gladys on summer vacations , and he knew his way about . He headed for the Grand Central subway station and took the shuttle to Times Square where he changed for a Harlem train . He stood at the front window of the first coach with his back to the other passengers , his emotions reading a secret language in the red and amber and green lights that swept past in the noisy night of the underground . At 110th Street lie began to wonder where he would get off . Such were now the tiny decisions that clogged his consciousness . He was too free ! For no reason at all he rode past 110th Street and at 125th Street he decided to get off simply because it was one of the best-known thoroughfares in Harlem . Standing uncertainly on the platform , he debated : Maybe 125th Street is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . . . . He waited for a local and rode to 135th Street and got off and climbed the stairs to the upper world . Loitering , holding his suitcase , his cheeks stinging from the icy wind , he pondered what direction to take to find a room . When he finally ambled forward , he avoided looking into the faces of the passers-by , feeling instinctively that he did not have the right to do Si ) . He was without a name , a past , a future ; no promises or pledges hound him to those about him . He had to become human before lie could mingle again with people . Yet he needed those people and could become human only with them . Dimly he realized that his dilemma , though personal , bore the mark of the general . The lives of children , too , were subjected to this same necessity ; they , too , could become human only by growing up with human beings . . . . He came to Seventh Avenue and walked up to 136th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last he saw a brick houseP128set well back from the sidewalk with shutters closed and it appealed to him . It was as though his doubt about his right to exist blended with the closed shutters and the distance the house was from the street . He mounted stone steps and rang the bell ; the opening door disclosed a woman with a brown face  --  a burning cigarette slanting across her chin made her seem sluttish at first  --  wearing a dark blue dressing gown . He saw the tip of a soiled brassiere struggling to keep her bulging breasts to the dimensions of modesty . She was about twenty-eight or thirty , had hard surfacy eyes that might have indicated that she was limited in her thinking . Woman as body of woman shot through his senses , but he pushed the impulse from him ; he was in too much danger now to play around ... . " What can I do for you ? " she asked bluntly . " You have a room for rent , I think , " Cross said a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She was the kind of woman who would most likely take him for granted and not pry into his past ; her attitude seemed to place her in the sane , ordinary events of Harlem life . " Come on in if you want to see it , " she said . He stepped inside , set his suitcase in a corner , and followed her down a hallway and up a flight of steps to a second floor . She trailed an odor of tobacco smoke . She opened the door of a large room and threw him a defiant glance . " There it is , " she said flatly . He sized her up as a naive woman who had created about herself a hard-boiledness of manner to protect a too believing nature that had been tramped on and abused by sundry men . In appearance , she was intensely feminine , seemingly ready to surrender in a yearningfor a happiness which she was certain she would be cheated out of in the end . " How much is the rent ? " he asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll take it . " " You do n't have to decide right now , " she told him ; she seemed to be uncertain of herself . " I want a room and here is one : large , airy , clean . I 'll take it , " he smiled at her , took out his wallet and gave her a ten-dollar bill . " When do you want to move in ? " she asked . " I 'm here , " he said . " My bag 's downstairs . It 's simple . " P129Having identified himself as Addison Jordan , Cross , half an hour later , was lying on his bed , trying to plot out his life . The weather continued bitterly cold . An icy wind swooped from a bleak sky , ripped against windowpanes , and clawed at passers-by in the streets . Cross , overcome by a listlessness which he could not shake off , spent his days either lounging in his room or in the consolingshadows of movie houses . He was Mrs. Hattie Turner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly in her cups at times , stumbling around downstairs in her dining room or kitchen . Ile learned from a gossipy drugstore clerk that she was a widow who owned her own home , that she drank a little too much , and that she had recently begun to receive the attentions of two men . Most of the time he could hear her playing blues or jazz records whose wild rhythms wailed up to him through the thin flooring . The raucous blue-jazz became his only emotional home now and Ile listened with an appreciation he had never had before . He came to feel that this music was the rhythmic flauntings of guilty feelings , the syncopated outpourings of frightened joy existing in guises forbiddenand despised by others . He sensed how Negroes had been made to live in but not of the land of their birth , how the injunctions of an alien Christianity and the strictures of white laws had evoked in them the very longings and desires that that religion and law had been designed to stifle . He realized that this blue-jazz was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant ethic just as his own consciousness had sprung conditioned to defiancefrom his relationship to his mother , who had shrilly evoked iii him exactly what she had so desperately tried to smother . Bluejazzwas the scornful gesture of men turned ecstatic in their state of n  --  jection ; it was the musical language of the satisfiedly amoral , the boastings of the contentedly lawless , the recreations of the innocentlycriminal .... Cross smiled with depressed joy as he paced about his room , his ears full of the woeful happiness of the blues and the orgiastic culpability of jazz . He had enough money to keep him for a while . Each night he vowed that on the following morning he would do something practicalabout his problem of identity , but the morning found him ready with excuses for inaction . He avoided trying to justify his fear of activity , but in his heart he knew that to exert himself was to invite down upon him those spells of dread ; so he remained inert ,  |p130ho|ping  that by blending his bleak mood with the empty hours he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening he would encounter Mrs. Turner in the downstairs hallway and they would exchange greetings . Whenever she asked him if he were comfortable , he would tell her that everything was all right in a tone of voice that sought to hold her off from him , for he sensed slumbering in her strained manner a nervousness whose content he did not want to know . Now and then he noticed two well-dressed Negroes coming to visit her , but they roused neither his interest nor jealousy . When she did finally break in on his jealous solitude , it was with a naive brusqueness that swept him before it and he was again acting with swift heartlessness to save himself . His anxiety rose when he noticed her staring at him . Inflamed , his dread distorted innocent events . Was n't she suspicious about his background ? Why did those two men come to see her ? Why were they always together ? Did n't policemen act that way ? Why was n't Mrs. Turner more relaxed with him of late ? He even wondered if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning of the day of his flight , Mrs. Turner failed to return his greeting in the hallway . Late that evening , she knocked at his door . Ile made sure that his gun was handy , then rose and confronted her . She stared at him blankly , embarrassed . " God , I 'm rattled tonight , " she complained . " I came up here to say something , and now , for the life of me , I ca n't remember what it was . " She tapped the knuckles of her hand against her forehead . " It 'll come back to me in a minute . If it does n't , then it couldn't 've been so very important , could it ? I 'm silly . " She forced a smile and left . Cross was frantic . Had she come up to make sure that he was in his room ? He ached to grab her and shake the truth out of her . He was certain that she had not forgotten the object of her errand ; a mere failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quickly he packed his suitcase . Maybe she was trying to tempt him . . . ? Or maybe the cops were waiting downstairs ? Or perhaps she wanted to talk to him about some problem of her own ? But how could he tell ? He sat on the side of the bed and sweated . A moment later he heard water running in the bathroom . He leaped from the bed , grabbed his suitcase and softly groped his wayp131out , tiptoeing . In the hallway he heard the sound of water still coming from the bathroom and he could see a light shining from beneath the sill . He crept down the stairs to the front door and paused ; he opened it and saw a bluish haze hanging in the dim streets . It was late , far past midnight ; the world was wrapped in silence . He ran over the snow to the sidewalk , walked to Seventh Avenue , and ducked into a subway , relieved that he was free , free to wrestle again with the tyranny of himself . His fear drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was defenseless . He had to work out of this dream somehow ... . Cross 's opportunistic rejection of his former life had been spurred 1 ) y his shame at what a paltry man he had made of himself . What little external pressure had compelled him to this stance was also a part of that self which he had rejected , for he alone had been responsible for what he had done to Gladys and Dot . His consciousness of the color of his skin had played no role in it . Militating against racial consciousness in him were the general circumstances of his upbringing which had shielded him from the more barbaric forms of white racism ; also the insistent claims of his own inner life had made him too concerned with himself to cast his lot wholeheartedlywith Negroes in terms of racial struggle . Practically he was with them , but emotionally he was not of them . He felt keenly their sufferings and would have battled desperately for any Negro trapped in a racial conflict , but his character had been so shaped that his decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . What really obsessed him was his nonidentity , which negated his ability to relate himself to others . He realized that what was happening to him now had been buried implicitly all along in his past life , had slumbered there in the form of a habit of acute reflection , in the guise of a certain coldness in judging even those closest to him , all because none of them really interested him . He had long yearned to be free of all responsibilities of a certain sort , but not because he had n't a capacity for responsibility . What had irked him about his past responsibilities had been their dullness , their tenuity , their tendency simply to bore him . What he needed , demanded , was the hardest , the most awful responsibility , something that would test him and make him feel his worth . And his SouthP132Side Chicago environment had held forth no hope of his ever being able to find any such responsibility . Where could he find such experiences , such spheres of existence ? In the main he accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the sufferings , terrors , accidental births , and meaninglessdeaths of that world , he rejected the Biblical prescriptions of repentance , prayer , faith , and grace . He was persuaded that what started on this earth had to be rounded off and somehow finished here . He had reckoned that getting rid of the claims of others would automatically open up to him what he wanted , but it had merely let him live in the empty possibility of action whose spell , by a purgingreality of its aliveness , had bound him more securely in foolish drifting . The world became distant , opaque ; he was not related to it and could find no way of becoming so . It was this static dream world that had elicited those acts of compulsion , those futile attempts to coerce reality to his emotional demands . There was in him a need to stabilize his surroundings . The world of most men is given to them by their culture , and , in choosing to make his own world , Cross had chosen to do something more dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strays unknowingly from one 's path ; one then looks up suddenly for familiar landmarks , and , seeingnone , one feels lost . Panic drapes the look of the world in strangeness , and the more one stares blankly at that world , the stranger it looks , the more hideously frightening it seems . There is then born in one a wild , hot wish to project out upon that alien world the world that one is seeking . This wish is a hunger for power , to be in command of oneself . Cross 's heart was full of a longing to search for himself and create a future as he walked up the exit stairway of the 116th Street subwaystation the night he had fled from Hattie and started looking again for a room in which to hide . When he reached the sidewalk the weather had turned to sleet and it was bitter cold . Lugging his suitcase through the slush underfoot , he leaned against the stinging wind and squinted his eyes , seeking a FOR RENT sign . He was tired ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he felt the pavement beneath his feet trembling from the rush of undergroundp133trains . Ahead he saw faint blobs of traffic lights wink from red to green and back again . Here and there a few neon signs glowed , half lost in murkiness . He went into a little bar that was almost empty and ordered a whisky . As he sipped his drink , his eyes fell upon a series of crude signs on the dingy walls . He smiled as he read : IF YOU SPIT ON THE FLOOR AT HOME , YOU MAY DO SO HERE . Under the wording was a drawing of a coarse-faced man in a nicely furnished room reclining in an easy chair ; his legs were stretched out and his feet rested upon a sofa . Ile was expectorating upon the floor , much to the horror of his longsufferingwife , who was on her hands and knees with a scrub rag trying to keep the floor clean . Another sign read : DO NOT ASK FOR MR . CREDIT . HE DIED A LONG TIME AGO AND WE BURIED HIM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave in a hideously dilapidated cemetery . Engravedon the headstone was : MR . BROKE , BORN APRIL 1 , 1949  --  DIED APRIL 2 , 1949 . Cross wondered who thought up such legends . The image of the grave made him think how he was supposed to be dead . How fantastic it seemed ; How did his grave look ? And where was it ? He did not even know the name of the cemetery . . . . He sighed and closed his eyes . Wonder what Gladys engraved on my tombstone . . . ? He visualized big words hewn into marble : CROSS DAMON1924  --  1950In Loving MemoryWould Gladys say more than that ? Hell , would she even say that much . . . ? Perhaps she might ; people had a way of forgiving you when you were dead . And why not ? You could not hurt them then and maybe their forgiving you was an expression of their joy at your being dead ... ? He downed his last drop of whisky , then held his breath , caught in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of all that was reasonable had n't he thought of it before ? It was too easy , that 's why . He had often read about such things in newspapers ; it had been reliably reported that underground Communists had establishednew identities by such methods . Why not ? It more than answered his problem . Sure ; all he had to do was to go to a ceme-P134tery and find the name of a man born on his birthday or any birthdaythat would make his present age and appearance seem normal ! Why , if he were clever about it , he could even have a birth certificate ! He had been pounding his brain for days for a new identity , and all he had to do was go to a graveyard and copy down a name . And there might be a hell of a wide choice ; he could even afford to be critical about whose name he took . First thing in the morning he would go . " Hey , another whisky here , " he called to the bartender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , you know where a guy can find a room for rent in this neighborhood ? " The bartender pursed his lips , put down the whisky bottle and stood thoughtfully . " I know a Mrs. Crawford who lives up the street , " the bartender told him . " She 's been asking me to send her somebody . She 's kind of old , but she 's got a nice place . I lived there once myself , ' fore I got married . " Cross took down the number ; he gulped his drink , thanked the bartender and was about to go when the door flew open and two Negro policemen entered . Dread froze him to his stool . One cop sat to one side of him and the other went to the end of the room and looked about the bar carefully , his eyes at last resting upon Cross 's face . Cross scarcely breathed . Was this it ? He kept his head down , hiding his features . Goddamn , why did he always have to have that suitcase with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops coldly examining the reflection of his face in the mirror opposite him . Yes , they were looking him over ; there was no doubt about it . He slipped his hand slowly into his overcoat pocket and grasped the gun . Then he started violently . " It 's okay , Jerry . Set it up in the back , " one of the cops boomed out . " Right , " the bartender said . Both cops disappeared wordlessly into the rear and Cross felt his muscles relaxing . The bartender took a bottle of whisky back to the cops . When he returned , Cross said in a whisper : " I thought they were raiding the joint . " " Them ? Hell , naw . They want a drink . They 're on duty this time of night and they 're just making sure no spotters are about , that 's all . Say , you gon na take that room ? "  | " Yeah , sure , " Cross said . " Thanks a million . " Ten minutes later he was climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rang the bell , waited , then he heard an old woman 's voice ask : " Who is it ? " Cross told her that Jerry , the bartender , had sent him for a room . She opened the door and peered at him . She was about sixty years old and had on a dressing gown . She 'll be safe , Cross thought . " Oh , you want a room ? Kind of late you know .... Well , come in . " " I just got into the city , " Cross lied . " I see , " she said , trudging slowly down the darkened hallway . Mrs. Crawford was a brown-skinned , talkative , motherly , and slightly crippled old woman who was rather nervous at his sudden appearance . " When did Jerry tell you ' bout this room ? " " A few minutes ago , Mrs. Crawford . I just left the bar , " Cross assuredher . He accepted the room , paid his rent and an hour later he was in a warm bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Soon he would have an identity . But what kind of man would lie pretend to be ? What kind of beliefs would he pretend to have ? Would he pretend studiousness or gaiety ? He would choose the kind of disposition that would make people like him and accept him . Was n't that the way life was lived in this world ? Did n't people select deliberately the types of personality that would get them the kind of attention that they thought would help them ? He laughed silently on his bed , enjoying the insight into life that his outlandish position was giving him . He felt that at last he was beginning to grapple with his problem , was getting near its meaning . The next morning near ten o'clock Cross was roused from sleep by the solicitously soft voice of Mrs. Crawford calling to him through the partly opened door . " Good morning . Would n't you like a hot cup of coffee ? " she asked , smiling shyly . " I 'd love some , Mrs. Crawford . Would you mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her . " Come right along . Make yourself at home here , son , " she said . " I 've no dining room ; you 'll have to take it in the kitchen . " " That 's all right with me , " he told her . He liked her and felt secure ; she was homey . Unlike Hattiep136Turner , her concerns were simple . He slipped into his bathrobe and lumbered into a spotlessly tiny kitchen . " Hope I did n't wake you up too early , " Mrs. Crawford mumbled . " Not at all . I should have been up hours ago , " Cross said , sipping black coffee and wondering about how to find a graveyard . " That weather outdoors beats everything ! " Mrs. Crawford exclaimed . Through the fogged windowpane Cross could see a world of churning bits of snow and could hear the wind whimpering like a thing in agony as it tore past the corner of the building . " Looks like we 're in for it , " Cross commented . " A body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , especially on days like this , " Mrs. Crawford proceeded to give her views on life . She was skinny , brittle , fragile in her bone structure ; her eyes were sunken , cloudy , weak . " There 's nothing better than a good cup of hot coffee , " he agreed , feeling that this woman was lucky to have such elementary preoccupations . " Planning to stay in Harlem long ? " " I do n't know yet , " he answered honestly . " Where 're you from , if you do n't mind my asking ? " " Not at all ; I 'm from Maine , " he lied , naming the first state that popped into his mind . " Maine ? Well , what do you know about that ! Are many colored people up there ? " " Plenty , " he continued lying , beginning to relish it . " I did n't know that . " Mrs. Crawford sighed over a world much too big and complex for her . " Well , you 're young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me , I 'm old and I 'm not long for this life . I just pray and keep my house straight and wait for the Good Lord to call me home . " Her voice was charged with courageous resignation . " Oh , no ! You 'll be around for a long time yet . " Cross spoke with make-believe sincerity . She looked as if she would die in two weeks . Malnutrition , maybe , he said to himself . " The only thing I worry about is keeping up my insurance payments , " the old woman went on , as though talking to herself . " I 'll have just enough money to lay me away decently . I do n't want aP137pack of strangers toting this old body of mine off to some potter 's field . If I thought something like that would happen to me , why , I would n't be able to sleep at night . Before my poor husband died he bought us a little plot out in the Woodvale Cemetery . That 's where my blessed husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please God . " Cross 's interest heightened . " Is Woodvale a nice cemetery ? " he asked casually . " It 's beautiful , " the old woman cried enthusiastically . " I 'm so happy I 'll be sleeping there till God calls me to rise from the dead . " She paused and looked quizzically at Cross . " But son , you 're young . flow come you interested in cemeteries ? " " I was thinking about taking out some insurance , " Cross explained . " I 'm alone too and I 've got to look out for myself . I may as well buy a plot somewhere . . . . " " You 're wise , " Mrs. Crawford approved . " Ai n't too many young folks these days serious enough to worry about important things like that . . . . " Her dim eyes shone . " Just a minute  --  I want to show you something . " She rose and hobbled hurriedly out of the kitchen . Poor woman , Cross thought . Mrs. Crawford returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She placed it upon the kitchen floor and commenced to unwrap it . Cross saw a pile of filmy summer clothing , each piece of which was delicately folded in white t issue paper . " This is what I 'm going to wear , " Mrs. Crawford said , looking at him appealingly . " Do n't you think it 's nice ? " " Yes ; it 's nice , " Cross said , puzzled . " But where 're you going to wear it ? " " When I pass to the other shore to meet Jesus , this is what they 're going to dress me in , " Mrs. Crawford told him sweetly . Cross quickly bent forward and fingered the aged material . There was a pearl-handled fan made of large , colored feathers ; there was a faded silk , cream-colored parasol ; there was a long , tea-colored ruffled voile dress which had huge pleats and a decollete neckline ; and there was a pair of fragile , high-heeled slippers . Cross noticed that she had even included a pair of nicely starched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price tags had not been removed . Christ Almighty ! The woman was acting as though she was preparing to go to a cocktail party . He opened his mouth to tellP138her that her burial wardrobe was for summer and not this raging blizzard outdoors , but thought better of it . Yes , each time he thought that he was mad , he met someone else with a head full of sane , sociallyacceptable madness . " Where is Woodvale ? " he asked gently , sighing . " Out near White Plains  --  " " Is it a colored cemetery ? " he asked . " Strictly colored , " Mrs. Crawford assured him . " And only the best colored folks are buried there . You 'd be surprised at how well they keep those graves . Why , in the summertime , it 's like a garden . I was lucky to get my plot when I did , for the prices have gone up somethingawful . " " You 're right , " Cross said , thinking that he would go out to White Plains at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " ' Twas n't nothing , young man , " she told him . Half an hour later Cross was hurrying toward the subway through the blizzard . He was grateful for the lack of visibility , for that would obscure him when he was pillaging the tombstones of the graveyard for names and dates . Arriving at White Plains , he inquired his way to the Woodvale Cemetery . He had to take a long bus ride and then tramp almost a mile through deep snowdrifts . At last the cemetery came into view , veiled by snowflakes dancing crazily in the winter wind . Myriads of white marble crosses and tombstones stretched away in a white shroud . The huge , iron gate was locked ; no one was about . He climbed over the fence and stood in the white silence , a feeling of unreality filling him . He went to the nearest grave and peered at the inscription on the headstone : MARY HAWKINS . The hell with her .. . He searched farther and read : MAYBELLA SMITH . Shucks . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . He looked at yet another which said : BESSIE ROUNDTREE . Hell , were only women buried here ? He walked a good way into the cemetery , looking over his shoulder to make certain that he was not being observed . He approached another batch of graves , bent and wiped snowflakes from a slab of marble with his hand and read : JAMES HOLIDAY-1934-1948 . Hunh . . . Cross was thoughtful . Only twelve years old , just a kid . . . Ile looked farther , reading : NEIL BROWN-1870-1950 . That old bugger had a long span ... . It was harder to find a good birth date and a name than hep139thought . Snow was heaping up on the crown of his hat and his feet ached with cold . He stood , breathing gusts of vapor into the snowflakesthat flitted about his face and clogged his eyelids . Dammit , he could n't give up now . But an hour later he had not found what he wanted ; he had seen graves containing young girls , old men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife , of brother and sister , all kinds of graves , white and eternally silent in t he shuddering snow . But all these dead seemed to have been born either too early or too late for him to use their abandoned names . ... Hell , there must be some young men here my age , he told himselfbitterly , his teeth chattering , his body shivering in an icy gale . Finally , when he discovered that he was examining the same graves twice , he saw a plain , obscure grave he had somehow overlooked , whose cheap , wooden board at the head of the mound read : LIONEL LANE-1924 , June 29th-1950 , March 3rd . . . . Ah , this was something like it . The guy had been buried only two days ago . . . . He scraped the clinging snowflakes from the headboard and read the rest of the inscription : Sleeping secure in the Faith of the Second Coming of Our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ , Amen . Awkwardly , Cross copied down the name and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' second coming ; but , what the hell , take it all down ; it could n't do any harm . Had this guy been widely known ? Would it be wise for him to go to the Bureau of Vital Statistics and ask for a birth certificate in the name of Lionel Lane ? What proofs of identity would the clerks ask him for ? He would have to invent a good pretext . . . . Well , he would try it . What could he lose ? After all , the identity he was seeking did n't have to be foolproof ; he wanted a mask of normality just airtightenough to enable him to start living again without too much fear . He would create his own past if he could find a respite of but a few weeks . But if he wanted to assume Lionel Lane 's name , should n't he try to learn something about him ? Where he had worked ? How he had lived ? Did he have a family ? His ardor ebbed somewhat when he realized that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name . But there must be a caretaker somewhere around who could tell him if Lane had belonged to a church , or the name of theP140funeral home from which he had been buried . . . . He looked about in the sea of frightened snowflakes , full again of that old sense of dread . But there 's nothing to be scared of . Find the caretaker and tell him that Lionel Lane had been an old pal of his , that he had just come from the army and had learned that poor Lionel was dead , and that he was searching for Lionel 's folks ... . Cross struggled through the snowdrifts back to the huge , iron gate and peered about for signs of life , a house . . . . Nothing but silence and scudding swirls of whiteness . He was about to leave when he noticed on the gate a square , wooden plaque whose face was obscured by a thick layer of snow crystals . He cleaned the flakes away with his coat sleeve and read : Address all inquiries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More frozen than alive , he dragged himself out of the cemetery and tramped back to the street . When the bus rolled silently toward him he stumbled on board and had difficulty getting his money out of his pocket , his fingers were so frozen . At the office of the Woodvale Cemetery in White Plains , Cross found a colored girl of about eighteen years chewing gum behind a typewriter . In reply to his plea about the relatives of his " long-lost pal , " Lionel Lane , the girl said : " You 'd better come back this afternoonat four when Mr. Sloane 's in , because I 'm not allowed to give out information like that to anybody  --  " " What harm could that do ? " Cross asked . " My friend 's dead now . Come on , have a heart . " Cross aped nostalgic distress . " I want to see his mother  --  " " Why do n't you try his pastor at his church ? " the girl suggested . " I do n't know his church or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old , dear friend of his , huh ? " the girl asked him in a light , taunting voice . " But I never asked him about his religion  --  " " He lived in Harlem , " the girl said . " But that 's all I can tell you . I 'm sorry , but you 'll have to see Mr. Sloane .... " The girl resumed her gum chewing and turned back to her typewriter . He decided not to press her further ; he thanked her and left . He did n't want that girl to recall that a young man had been demanding details about Lionel Lane .... Dammit , he had failed in his first try . But perhaps he could phone the office later in the afternoon and pretendthat he was . . . Who could he pretend to be ? He stood musingP141in the street amid the circling columns of snow , then he looked again at the scrap of paper on which he had written the data from the wooden headboard of Lionel Lane 's grave , rereading the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Lord the Savior , Jesus Christ , Amen . " Where and when had he heard words like those before ? They reminded him of something . Yes ! Of course . That inscription expressed the cardinal article of faith of the Seventh Day Adventist Church ! He had , in his childhood in the Deep South , met and known Adventists . True , it was a guess , but not at all a bad one . His task , now , was to find the Seventh Day Adventist Church from which Lane had been buried . The girl had said that Lane had lived in Harlem , and it would be safe to assume that the church was there ... . During the subway ride to Harlem , he pondered over the difficultiesinvolved in his quest . As the excitement wore off he realized that he was attempting a long-shot gamble . For instance , he did not know if Lionel Lane had been born in the State of New York or not . Suppose it turned out that Lionel Lane had been born in , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 110th Street he got out of the subway , went into a drugstore and consulted a telephone directory . There were three addresses of Seventh Day Adventist organizations in Harlem . One was on West 135th Street and another was on West 123rd Street ; and there was still another organization called the Seventh Day Adventist Conferenceon West 150th Street . . . . Yes , he 'd call the Conference . He dialed and heard a suave , masculine voice answering : " Hello . " " This is the Eastern Insurance Company , " Cross lied smoothly . " I wonder if you 'd be kind enough to give us some information , please ? " " Yes . What is it ? " " We are searching for the address of a man 's family ; the man , we believe , was buried from one of your Harlem churches about two or three days ago . The name is Lane , Lionel Lane . Could you tell us where his parents are living ? Or do you know the last address of the deceased ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking uneasily over his shoulder at people shoppingat the counter of the drugstore . " We have no direct information here , sir . But I understand thatP142there was a funeral three days ago at our Ephesus Church at 101 West 123rd Street . Why do n't you get in touch with Elder Wiggins there ? " " Thank you , " Cross said . He dialed Elder Wiggins and , still impersonating an insurance official , asked for the whereabouts of the Lane family . " Oh , yes , " the gentle , tired voice of a man answered . " We held services for the departed at our church last Thursday . But I can not help you very much , sir . My secretary 's not here for the moment . But I know that the Lane family lives in Newark , New Jersey . The departed lived here in Harlem , I 'm fairly certain . You see , the departedwas not himself a member of our church . His mother , Mrs. Mary Lane , is one of our oldest members and , though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our church . If you 'd care to phone later today . . . . " " It wo n't be necessary , " Cross said . " Our Newark office will be able to locate the family . I thank you very much . " So Lionel Lane had parents in New Jersey . Well , he 'd go there right now . Twenty minutes later Cross was in Pennsylvania Station , hunched over a Newark telephone directory , feverishly thumbing the thin , crisp leaves , searching under L 's . Good Lord , there was a long list of Lanes : there was an Albert Lane , a Bernard Lane , a Daniel Lane , a Harry Lane . . . and then there came Mary Lane ... . This undoubtedly was Lionel Lane 's mother . He jotted down the address and an hour later he was in Newark , inquiring for the street on which the Lanes lived . He was so excited that he had to calm himself when he learned that the street was located in the heart of the local Black Belt : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! When he reached the bleak slum neighborhood , he slowed and mapped out his plan of attack . Presuming that he was on the track of the right family , to go to the Lane house directly and ask questionscarried a risk . If , when using the name of Lionel Lane , somethinghappened to him and that name got in the newspapers , someonemight recall that a stranger had been around asking vague questions . It would be better if he posed as a social worker or a salesman of some sort and in that way pick up bits of information from neighborsor shopkeepers . What kind of a family were the Lanes ? Workingclass or professional ? If they turned out to be a family of promi/Went citizens , then it would be almost impossible to go to the Bureau of Vital Statistics in a city like this and impersonate Lionel Lane and demand a birth certificate without getting into serious trouble . He first had to get hold of some basic facts . The Lane house proved to be a ramshackle , wooden affair , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Lionel Lane came out of this hellhole , then not many people of any consequence could have known him . But was this the house of the family of Lanes whose son was buried in Woodvale ? At that moment he saw an elderly Negro postman bent under the weight of a mailbag coming toward him over the snowy street . " Say , " Cross stopped him , " have you got a minute ? Maybe you can help me ? " The postman paused , spat a stream of tobacco juice into a snowdrift , eyed Cross cynically and mumbled : " That depends on what kind of help you want . I 'm on my rounds . " " I 'm from the Central Credit Bureau of New York City , " Cross lied . " I 'm trying to track down a young chap by the name of Lionel Lane . " " Lionel Lane ? " the postman echoed , smiling ironically . " He owed money somewhere ? " " Confidentially , yes . " " Well , the people who let him have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , spitting another spout of tobacco juice . " And you got a fat chance of collecting , ' cause that baby 's where you ca n't get at ' im . He 's six feet deep with snow in his face . He kicked off four or five days ago . Had consumption  --  " " Did he live with his family ? " " When he did n't have any dough , he did ; and that was almost all the time . He holed up somewhere in Harlem , with a dame . Did n't want his family to know where he was when he was with that dame . Had to forward all his mail there .... " " What kind of a family has he got ? Do you know ' em ? " " Ai n't but one person in that outfit that you could call human , and that 's the mother . . . . She 's solid , religious . But the rest of ' em  --  I 've seen ' em , but I do n't know ' em and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're thinking of giving the Lanes any more credit , then just do n't . " " What kind of work did Lionel Lane do ? "   " Work ? " the postman mocked Cross , chuckling . " He used to work in a laundry , but for the past two years he used all his energy pulling at the neck of a bottle  --  " " Thanks , buddy , " Cross said . He felt he had a chance . He went into a bar , The Fat Man , and over a whisky schemed out his next move . How soon was a death reported to the clerks in the Bureau of Vital Statistics ? Lionel Lane had died in Harlem and it was safe to assume that the Newark officialsdid not yet know that he was dead . When he approached the clerks about a birth certificate , there must not be in their minds any doubt whatsoever that he was Lionel Lane . One blunder and the whole structure he was so carefully building would tumble . How was he to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about white and black race relations to help him . If he could ever act the role of a subservient Negro convincingly , this was the time to do it . He would have to present to the officials a Negro so scared and ignorant that no white American would ever dream that he was up to anything deceptive . But why would any black wastrel be wanting a birth certificate ? Cross knew that the authorities were chronically watchful these days about handing out birth certificates , for spies were using such documents to establish their claim to having been born in the United States . In the end Cross decided that a simple , an almost silly reason was the best reason that an ignorant Negro could have in demanding a birth certificate ; it would have to be a reason that whites , long schooled in dealing with Negroes as frightened inferiors , would accept without question . FIe went to the City Hall and presented himself at the windowmarked : DUPLICATE BIRTH CERTIFICATES . Looking apprehensivelyabout , he took his place in line . When his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a plaintive , querulous tone : " He told me to come up here and get the paper . " The clerk blinked and looked annoyed . " What ? " " The paper , Mister . My boss told me to come and get it . " " What kind of paper are you talking about , boy ? " " The one that say I was born , " Cross told him as though he , in his ignorance , had to teach this white man what to do . The clerk smiled , then laughed : " Maybe you were n't born , boy . Are you sure you were ? " Cross batted his eyes stupidly . He saw that he was making thisp145poorly paid clerk happy ; his pretense of dumbness made the clerk f eel superior , white . " Well , they say I was born . If I was n't born , I ca n't keep my job . That 's why my boss told me to come here and get the paper . " Cross let a tiny edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with benevolent amusement and turned and yelled behind him : " Say , Jack ! Come here and get a load of this , will you ? " Another clerk , somewhat older , came forward and asked : " What 's up ? " " This coon clown says he was born somewhere , " the young clerk said . " I do n't believe it , " the older clerk said . " Oh , yes , sir . I was born , " Cross said , his lips hanging open , his eyes wide with desperation . " Can you prove it ? " the first clerk said . " Now , look here , Mister . I ai n't done nothing to nobody , ' specially to no white folks , " Cross wailed in deep distress . " The worst thing you ever did was to be born , " the older clerk said . " But I ai n't done nothing wrong , Mister , " Cross protested . " You 're always wrong , " the young clerk said . " Say , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The older clerk pulled down his mouth and muttered : " Hell , go ahead and give ' im a certificate if he was born around here . These clowns do n't mean any harm . " " If I ca n't say I was born , I 'll lose my job , " Cross complained . " Where do you work ? " the young clerk asked . " Machine Tools Company , in Brooklyn . " " What 's the address ? " " I do n't know the number , not exactly , Mister . But you take the Fulton Street bus and ride  --  " " Can that , " the older clerk said . " You were born in Newark , you are sure of that ? " " Yes , sir . " " Wait , Jack . He ought to know something about his job , " the young clerk said . " Say , boy , what 's your boss 's name ? " Cross stared in blank amazement , then he shook his head as though trying to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister , I do n't ask white folks their personal business , " he told them . The clerks shouted their laughter . " Where were you born in Newark ? " the young clerk asked . Cross blinked again , then looked up brightly , as though his memory had returned , and said : " In the Third Ward . " He pointed elaborately in the direction . " Whereabouts in the Third Ward ? " " Over the hill  --  Why , Mister , everybody knows where that is . " The two clerks howled with laughter . The young clerk asked : " What street were you born on over the hill , ' as you call it ? And on what date were you born ? And what 's your name ? You got a name , I suppose ? " " Yes , sir . They gave me a name , " he said , falling silent . " Well , what in hell is it ? " " But you know , " Cross said , amazement showing on his face . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two clerks bent double with mirth . And as he stood there manipulating their responses , Cross knew exactly what kind of man he would pretend to be to kill suspicion if he ever got into trouble . In his role of an ignorant , frightened Negro , each white man  --  except those few who were free from the race bias of their group  --  would leap to supply him with a background and an identity ; each white man would project out on him his own con- 4 ception of the Negro and he could safely hide behind it . " All right , boy , " the young clerk agreed . " We 'll give you your certificate if we can find your record . But we 've got to have your name and the year of your birth . We 're pretty smart here , I admit . But we 're not so smart that we can guess your name . " " They call me Lionel Lane , " Cross admitted at last . " In what year were you born ? " " My mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June . " " Give us a dollar and we 'll mail you a duplicate certificate , " the young clerk said . " But my boss told me to bring it in the morning , or I ai n't got no job , " Cross complained . " Okay . Sit down over there on that bench . We 'll see what we can do . We 'll look it up , " the older clerk said resignedly . Two hours later Cross had the duplicate birth certificate of LionelP147Lane and had left in the minds of the clerks a picture of a Negro whom the nation loved and of whom the clerks would speak in the future with contemptuous affection . Maybe some day I could rule this nation with means like this , Cross mused as he rode back to New York . All you have to do is give the people what they want .... He knew that deep in their hearts those two white clerks knew that no human being on earth was as dense as he had made himself out to be , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped them to feel racially superior . They were pretending , just as he had been pretending . But maybe men sometimes pretendedfor much bigger and graver stakes ? Cross was now as solidly identified as he felt he could be for the time being , and the first desire that sprang into his mind was to try to redress , to some extent , the unintentional wrong he had done to that waiter , Bob Hunter , whom he had met in the dining car more than two weeks ago . He fished in his pocket for the address , made his way to Harlem , and found the grim tenement where Hunter lived . Climbing six flights of rickety stairs , he squinted in shadows from doorway to doorway until he came to a white cardwhose printed legend read : MR . &; MRS . ROBERT HUNTER . He pushed the bell and a moment later he was staring into Bob Hunter 's brown and nervous face . The man was in his shirt sleeves and held a pamphlet with a yellow and red back in his left hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , where in hell have you been ? " Bob exclaimed , his face breaking in a broad grin . " I 've been looking for you everywhere ! Come in . " Cross walked into a large , clean , rather bare apartment and Bob led him into the living room . " You are Mr. Jordan , ai n't you ? " Bob asked to make sure . " How are you , Bob ? " Cross asked , ignoring the question . " Sit down , man , " Bob said . " I ai n't complaining , though I got a lot I could complain about . " Bob 's eyes were fixed intently upon Cross 's face and the lips held a nervous smile . Cross felt that he could not deceive the man any longer . " Bob , I suppose you wondered about me , hunh ? " Cross asked . " Well , I sure needed you , man . . . . I went to that address yougave me , but it was a funeral parlor and nobody knew you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an appealing yet venturesometone of voice . Cross placed his right hand reassuringly upon Bob 's shoulder . " Take it easy , Bob . I 'll explain everything . Say , how did you make out in that little trouble you had on the train ? " " Hunh ? What trouble ? " Bob asked . Cross knew that Bob was pretending that he had not understood . He 's trying to save face ... . " Did that woman on the train make any trouble for you ? " Cross asked . Bob shrugged his shoulders and laughed , but there was no mirth in his voice . " Trouble ? Hell , man , I got fired ! I lost my goddamn job , that 's all . " Bob 's eyes were evasive but he could not hide that he felt that Cross had betrayed him unpardonably . " I ai n't blaming you none , man . After all , you did jump up and stop that bitch from hitting me with that water pitcher , did n't you ? And if you gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Well , you know your own business . " " But did n't the union help you ? " Cross asked . " Man , I 'm too goddamn militant for my union , " Bob explained . " I had a hell of a fight with ' em . My union 's got a left wing and a right wing . I 'm with the left . When the company brought me up on charges , the rightists piled in on me , and I was out . Man , only you , an eye-witness , could have saved me . How come you fooled me like that ? You could 've said you did n't want to help me  --  Maybe I could 've found some other witnesses . But I did n't look for any tillit was too late . I was counting on you .... " Bob related how the white woman had sued the railroad , how the railroad had charged him with carelessness , how the leftists in the union had tried to defend him , and how , in the end , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corroborationof his version of the accident , he had lost . " But what about that priest ? " Cross asked . " I went to see ' im , " Bob said . " Told me he did n't want to get mixed up in it . Said his job was saving souls and stuff like that . Then he went off to Rome to see the Pope  --  " " I 'm sorry , Bob . " " Hell , man , it 's nothing , " Bob said defiantly . " Me and Sarah 's making out . "   " Are you working now ? I can let you have a loan  --  " " Man , " Bob 's face spread in a wide , glad grin , " I 'm working for the biggest outfit in the world ! " " What 's that ? " " The Party , man . " " What party ? " " Hell , man ! There ai n't but one Party and that 's the Communist Party , " Bob explained proudly . " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell do you think ? " " Do you like it ? " " I 'm crazy about it , " Bob confessed with a smile . " I 'm going to be a professional revolutionary , working twenty-four hours a day beating these rich white bastards . It makes me feel good ! " Bob went into the kitchen and brought out two bottles of cold beer and , opening them , set them on the table . " Listen , Bob , " Cross began , " I do n't trust many people in this world  --  " " I know that ! " Bob agreed . " You lied to me on that train so smooth that I would have died trusting your word . Man , you can lie ! " Bob 's howl of laughter was so infectious that Cross was forced to join in . " Bob , I 'm going to trust you as far as I dare  --  " " Man , I 'm black like you and you can trust me till death . Race means a lot to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidelity . " My name 's not Addison Jordan , " Cross said . " Hell , I found that out , " Bob said , exploding with laughter . " But what is it ? You do n't have to tell me unless you want to . " " Lionel Lane , " Cross said . Bob looked at Cross with skeptical eyes and grinned , a light of admiration showing in his face . " You telling me the truth now ? " " Well , " Cross hedged , feeling that it was impossible really to fool the man now . " I 'm Lionel Lane for the moment . " Cross could not help laughing at himself . " But it 's the name I 'm giving to everybodyfrom now on . " " You did something to the white folks and they 're looking for you , hunh ? " Cross looked away , chagrined . His life had become a vast system of pretense ; one act of bad faith necessitated another , and in orderP150to prove the sincerity of a new lie he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him if he had committed some act of racial heroism against whites , and the only people he had wronged thus far had been black . " Something like that , Bob , " he said vaguely with an embarrassed mumble . " Brother ! " Bob exclaimed seizing hold of Cross 's hand and pumpingit vigorously in fraternal friendship . " I 'm with you till the curtain comes down . " Cross 's teeth felt on edge , but he managed to say : " I feel I made you lose your job . I want to help you  --  " " Just be my friend , man ; that 's all the help I want . " Bob 's voice rang with hope , his words pouring out in a gush of forgiving generosity . " Now , I 'll tell you something , see ? I ai n't no American , I 'm British , see ? But I 'm black , like you . . . . I came to this goddamn country from Trinidad ten years ago . . . . Had to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . So I got to be careful too . " " Your secret 's safe with me , " Cross told him ; he now understood why Bob 's accent had seemed strange to him on the train . " Now , tell me what you did , " Bob asked . " You 'll just have to trust me . I ca n't tell you .... " " You ai n't no spy ? " " If I was , do you think I 'd tell you ? " They laughed . Bob was overcome with wonder . Cross 's secret loomed in his mind more important and intriguing than any concretecrime . " You were Mr. Jordan on the train , and now you 're Mr. Lane , " Bob mused , laughing . " That 's all right with me . " His eyes narrowed and he stared silently for a moment in deep thought . " Man , the Party could use you  --  " " Really ? Why do you say that ? " " You can be so many things at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cross said quickly . " Lionel , " Bob said , his mind working fast , " I 'm sorry my wife , Sarah , ai n't here to meet you . You 'll like her , man . She 's down to earth and takes nothing off nobody ; she 's militant . . . . Say , we 're having some folks over to a late dinner tonight . Why do n't you come over about nine-thirty and eat with us ? " Cross knew that Bob was trying to recruit him . He had no desireP151to join the Communist Party , but he knew that he would feel somewhatat home with Communists , for they , like he , were outsiders . Maybe communism would be the best temporary camouflage behind which he could hide from the law . And his secret past would make Communists think that he was anxious for their help . To be with them was not at all a bad way of ending his isolation and loneliness ... . " Who 's going to be there ? " Bob 's face beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talk just like the Party folks ! I declare you do ! " Bob laughed uproariously , delighted and amused . " Why do you say that ? " " You 're so suspicious  --  You do n't want to take a step without knowing where you 're going . . .. " Bob sobered . " They 're Party folks who 's coming . " " Who are they ? " " Man , you 're sure careful , " Bob commended him . " There 's gon na he Gil and Eva Blount , friends of mine . Gil 's a member of the CentralCommittee of the Communist Party . A damn nice guy . Man , he 's sharp , cold as ice . You 'll like him ; he 's a lot like you  --  And there 's gon na be my goddamn organizer , Jack Hilton . Then there 's me and Sarah , that 's all . And you , if you 'll come . " " It 's a deal , " Cross said , his eyes deep and thoughtful . Cross said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat brooding over Bob 's believing mind . He found himself amused and a little intrigued at the prospects of meeting some Communists tonight . In all his attempts to find some disguise for his outlaw existence , he had never seriously considered communism . But why riot ? Did not the Communists , like him , have a secret to hide ? And what was the Communist secret ? Cross felt that at the heart of all political movements the concept of the basic inequality of man was enthroned and practiced , and the skill of politicians consisted in how cleverly they hid this elementary truth and gained votes by pretending the contrary . If , by pretending , he could find a hiding place , why , he would pretend that he believed in the Communist pretensions . Why not ? They are deceivers and so am I. That ought to be fair enough , he thought as he took a long gulp of beer . But the Communists were shrewd ; they 'd hardly be taken in by his birth certificate ; he would have to buttress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? Of course . Lionel Lane 's draft card . . . The postman had said that Lane had died of consumption , so it was highly likely that Lane had been classified in the draft as unfit for military duty ... . He paid for his beer and went out into the falling snow . There was a black cop standing at the corner and he accosted him , telling him that he had been six months in Arizona for his health , that he had lost his draft card , and that he had forgotten the address of his draft board . . . . He gave the cop Lionel Lane 's address and in turn the cop directed him to the draft board which was located in the basement of a church . Cross was feeling better by the minute . When he found the church , which was on West 134th Street , he saw a throng of young men loitering about the entrance . No ; he would n't go in now ; he 'd wait until nearly closing time . He mingled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until nine o'clock that night . It was now a little after seven . He spent the hour and a half in a nearby movie and at ten minutes to nine approached the church , entered the basement and saw that a young Negro clerk was in charge ; there were three or four other young men hanging about . When the clerk came to him , Cross recited his prepared lie : " Look , I 'm listed as unfit for military duty with this board . I 've been in Arizona for the past six months for my health and I 'm sailing for France in the morning ; I 'm on my way to Switzerland . . . . But I 've lost my card . I 've got to get a duplicate , or I wo n't be allowed aboard the ship  --  " " What 's your name ? " " The name 's Lionel Lane . " The clerk left . Cross was nervous . If Lane 's death had already been reported , why , he 'd simply bolt for it . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got your record here , " the clerk began . " But how do I know you 're Lionel Lane ? " " Here 's my birth certificate , " Cross said , presenting the duplicate he had gotten in Newark . " Look , " the clerk said , examining the certificate , " I 'll fix up a duplicate card for you and I 'll have the chairman sign it , but the secretary of the board is the man who gives the final okay and he 's not here . You 'll have to come back in the morning  --  "   " But I 'm sailing in the morning . I 've got my ticket . I 'm packed to go " Gosh , " the clerk said . " This stumps me  --  " " But I got to have that card , " Cross insisted . " But I do n't have the authority to give it to you  --  " " You 're looking at my birth certificate , " Cross pointed out . " Look , anybody can have a birth certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here by routine . The chairman 'll sign your card tonight . But the secretary 's not in ; he wo n't be in till tomorrow morning  --  " " Okay , " Cross assented to the fairness of the clerk 's statement . " But , look , if I was trying to dodge the draft , do you think I 'd come here and ask for a duplicate ? " " I guess not , " the clerk grinned . " Say , what time do you sail ? " " I 've got to be at the boat at ten  --  " " Okay . I 'll get the card ready , have the chairman sign it . You be here at nine sharp in the morning and the secretary 'll give it to you . " " Is that all you can do ? " " That 's all , buddy . " " Okay . Thanks . " The clerk turned to another young man and Cross walked into the corridor . When the office closed tonight , his draft card would be signed and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could he get that card ? If he waited till morning , the secretary might raise questions and cause trouble . He walked along the corridor , thinking frantically . He looked around ; the lights in the inner offices had been turned off . He glanced over his shoulder and saw that the clerk was busy , bent over the files . Cross walked quickly to his left , not knowing where he was going . Could he hide in the office ? No , that was too dangerous . . . . How in God 's name could he get back here tonight , after everyone had gone ? He had it ; yes , he 'd open a latch on one of the windows near the ground . . . . He advanced slowly and softly into the dark , his hand outstretched to prevent his colliding with unseen objects . He flicked on his lighter and shielded the flame with his hand . Yeah ; there was a window . ... But could he reach it easily from the outside ? He doused the light , pushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , he could see that the window gave onto a fetid areaway . This was no good . . . . Footsteps in the corridor made him freeze ; through the openp154doorway he saw that a light had been clicked on in the office next to him . He waited . Maybe he could hide in a clothes closet ? The light went out and he heard footsteps retreating . The clerk had gone into that office for something and had returned to the front ... . He crept into another office and at once saw the dim reflection of a street lamp . This was it . . . . He unlatched the window and slid it up noiselessly . Fumbling in the dark , he took out his address book and tore off a page and inserted it beneath the sill , then stood debating . Maybe he ought to leave by this window ? Naw ; it was too risky . He closed the window ; the piece of paper would help him to identify the window from the outside . Re-entering the corridor , he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifting snow , scanning the street in both directions . There were not many passers-by , but he saw lights shining through the stained-glass windows of the church on the first floor . If a service was about to begin , all the better ; it would mean that no one would be prying around in the basement . He walked on till he spied the bit of paper jutting from the window sill . Lights still blazed in the draft office . Sheltering himself in a doorway , he waited . Ten minutes later the lights in the draft office winked out , one by one ; finally , the clerk , flanked by two other men , emerged . Was it safe to enter now ? Yes ; he 'd try it . He stood beneath the fluttering piece of paper and lingered till the street was empty ; then , in one quick movement , he hoisted the window , climbed into the office and dropped to the floor amid a shower of heaped-up snow from the sill . IIe closed the window , pushed the lever of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went into the corridor and looked into all the rooms . . . . Now , where was the desk of that draft board chairman ? He approached a big , shiny desk that had a swivel chair and saw a neat pile of manila folders . He grabbed them , thumbed quickly through them . Yeah ; goddammit , here it was ! He detached his draft card ; it was signed . He then read the items describing the physical appearance of Lionel Lane and grew thoughtful . Lionel Lane had weighed 158 pounds and he weighed only 148 .... Well , he could always say that he had lost ten pounds , could n't he ? That 's what tuberculosis did to you , did n't it . . . ? But this other item was more difficult ; Lionel Lane was listed as being five feet six inches in height and he was five feet eight . It was a little thing , but it might cause him trouble . . . . Oh , yes ; he could fix that . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anp1558 over that 6 ! He uncovered a machine ; holding his lighter in his left hand , he inserted the card , jiggled it until the figure 8 coincided with the 6 and hit the key . There . . . He put the card into his billfold , doubled the folder , stuffed it into his inside coat pocket . Now , get out of here .... He stood , thinking . Soon the death of Lionel Lane would be reported to the board and the personnel would be wondering what had happened to the folder of Lionel Lane . There would be some sort of inquiry . . . . A solution clicked in his mind . Yes , all the files should be destroyed . If his file alone was missing , questions would be raised ; but if all the files were missing , then he had a chance ... . And he noticed that each manila folder was wrapped in cellophane and cellophane burned like hell . . . . He opened a window so that a draft would feed the fire , then bent forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curl , leap into flame . He backed away , seeing the flames grow , spread from folder to folder ; soon the top of the desk was one blazing , red sheet with thick , acrid smoke . He opened the door and hurried out , then stiffened in his tracks . Good God ! His lips parted in stupefaction . He heard the surging of a lusty hymn coming from above ! He had forgotten that he was in a church ! But there was no help for that now ... . He left the door of the office open so that a current of air would sweep into the room ; then he went down the dark corridor to a stairway and mounted to the street level . The singing came loud and sonorous : Let the lower lights be burning ! Send a gleam across the wave ! Some poor fainting , struggling seaman You may rescue , you may save . He hurried into the street and looked back at the church , then up to the tall steeple which was faintly visible in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the block , wondering when the smoke or the flames would show . He saw a fire-alarm box and paused . A man passed . Then a child . He waited until the street was empty , opened the box , pulled the lever , then walked briskly to a corner drugstore , entered , perched himself atop a stool where he could watch the front of the church . He ordered a cup of coffee , sipped it , waiting . Suddenly he saw a man hurry from the church ; then a small knotP156of men came out ; soon a throng of people was pouring from the church door . A moment later he heard the sound of distant sirens . " Looks like there 's a fire somewhere , " the clerk behind the counter said . " I see some people running out of the church down the street , " Cross said casually . The clerk went to the window . " By God , you 're right ! Fire 's coming out of the basement window of the church ! " He joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blazing ... " How much is this cup of coffee ? " he asked . " Huh ? " the clerk grunted . " How much is this coffee ? " " Ten cents . " Cross left a dime on the counter and walked calmly from the drugstore . He had a dinner engagement to meet some Communists . A quarter of an hour later Cross climbed six flights and pushed the bell of Bob 's flat . Bob himself opened the door and grabbed his arm . " Man , give me your coat and hat  --  Sarah 's here and raring to meet you , " Bob said , guiding Cross straight to the kitchen where Sarah , a brown-skinned woman with a strong , hard face , was cooking dinner . " Sarah , honey ! C'mere ! I want you to meet Mr. Lane ! " Sarah was bent over a table busily flattening dough with a rolling pin ; she glanced up at Cross , then quickly back to her biscuit board . " Just a sec , " she answered placidly . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pliable muscles seemed as strong as any man 's . She had black hair , a wellshapedmouth and a firm chin . Her movements were deft as she cut the thin spread of dough into biscuits and placed them swiftly into tin pans and shoved them into an oven . She wiped her hands on a dish towel , turned and smiled . Then her face grew solemn as she came toward Cross and stared with eyes full of surprise . Cross 's muscles grew rigid . Had Sarah seen him before ? Maybe he had known her in Chicago ? Because she was staring at him , he stared at her . Sarah advanced to within a few inches of Cross and broke into a wide grin . " What 's the matter , Sarah ? Ca n't you say hello ? " Bob exclaimed . P157Sarah cupped her right palm under Cross 's chin , cradling it gently . Then she began to laugh , still holding Cross 's face . She said : " Look at that face  --  Lead Kindly Light . . . And he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man , you got the sweetest face I ever saw ! " She turned from Cross , laughing even louder . Bob joined in , but more sheepishly than Sarah . Their laughter filled the corridor . Maybe they were getting even with him for his having deceived Bob . . . ? " Do n't be mad , man ! You got to get used to Sarah  --  She just blabs out what pops into her mind , that 's all , " Bob explained through his laughter . Cross had had the illusion of feeling at home with these outsiders , but now he felt himself being pushed more than ever into that position where he looked at others as though they were n't human . He could have waved his hand and blotted them from existence with no more regret than if he were swatting a couple of insects . Could he ever make others realize how dangerous it was for them to make him feel like this ? He lowered his eyes and stared at them , a tight smile hovering on his lips . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew that he had the kind of face that would always look much younger than his age , but never in his life had another person grabbed hold of that face with their bare hands and made blatant fun of it . What kind of life had Sarah lived that made it possible for her to laugh at him so openly ? Pity for her came into his mind , but he banished it , realizing that it was hard to pity someone who most likely did not want it . She and Bob were still laughing . " Okay , " Cross said finally . " Maybe I look funny to you . " " Naw  --  You ai n't funny ! " Sarah spluttered . " You 're just out of this world  --  And you want to be a Bolshevik ! Why , child , they 'll eat you for dessert ! " Cross sank into a chair and stared at a print of the Moscow subway that hung on the wall . He had conquered his impulse to anger now ; he did not respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value as human beings had gone ; if they existed , all right ; if they did not exist , that was all right too . . . . " Okay . Do n't you think I deserve a drink for all that ? " he asked them in tones of mild reproof . " All right , honey , " Sarah said at last . " I 'm gon na show you myp158heart 's in the right place . I 'm gon na give you a whole glass of whisky  --  You had whisky before , ai n't you ? " " You 'd be surprised , " Cross told her . " Know one thing , " Sarah said , pouring whisky into a tumbler . " I 'm laughing , but I wonder about you  --  " " Why ? " Cross asked . " I see now how Bob made a mistake to trust you on that train , " Sarah said soberly . " But I wouldn't 've trusted you . No , sir ! That nice suit you got on , that nylon shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to me . I 'd trust that face of yours as far as I could throw an elephant , and you know that ai n't far ! What you reckon the Communists gon na make out of you ? " " I do n't know , " Cross answered . He understood now . Sarah and Bob felt that Communists oughtto look like Communists ; that is , ragged , desperate , with a slightly ! crazy air . Of course , there were exceptions : white men with cold , sharp minds who sat in dim offices and who ran things , the intellectuals . But Sarah and Bob never expected to see a black intellectual and did not know one when they saw one . " When did you join the colored race ? " Sarah asked , sniggling . " I never joined , " Cross said . Sarah went off into the kitchen , shaking with laughter . Bob stood near him and kept his right hand on Cross 's shoulder . Cross took a long swig from the tumbler ; he needed it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If we laugh at you , it 's ' cause we like you , see ? " " I 'm not angry , " Cross said in a faraway voice that made Bob sober quickly . The doorbell rang and Cross was glad . If white guests were arriving , Sarah and Bob would stop baiting him . Bob went to the door . " Gil and Eva ! Come in ! I got somebody here I want you to meet , " Bob greeted his guests . A stolid white man and a tall , blonde white girl came in . Cross rose to meet them . " I 'm Gilbert Blount , " the man said , extending his hand , holding a fixed smile on his face . The man 's eyes were hard , watchful , gray , and bulbous . " How are you , Mr. Blount ? " Cross asked  | " I 'm Gil to my friends , " Blount said . " I 'm Lionel , " Cross lied . " And I 'm Eva , " the girl said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in here to wet your throats ! " Bob called to them to come into the living room . It was clear that Bob intended to leave them to talk together and Cross sensed that the meeting had been arranged . What had Bobtold Gil about him ? Had he led Gil to believe that he had done id some great stroke of racial retaliation against whites ? That would be like Bob . All right , he 'd let these Communists look him overand he 'd look them over . IBut he did n't like Gil ; there was about the man , even before he had found more valid reasons for his aversion , a rigidity of bodily pose that irked him . Gil was thin without being wiry , tall without being big , aged without being old , and intellectual without partaking of the processes of thought . He spoke in a manner that seemed to indicate that he had difficulty getting the words out of his mouth . Life to Gil was a stubborn , humorless effort that revealed itself in the stiffness of lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthing of his huge teeth when he laughed , which was not often . And back of this was a cold hunger in the man that Cross could not name , a waiting , calculating consciousness whose ends seemed remote . Gil caught Cross 's elbow in a firm grip and said : " Bob told me you were coming here tonight , and I 'm glad you came . Whatever your background is , you can feel at home with us . " Cross smiled a smile that he hoped would be interpreted as gratitude . How quickly they work together , Cross thought with wonder . Gil had swallowed the lies he had palmed off on Bob and his reference to his background delighted him . What would Gil think if he really knew ? Two strange backgrounds are meeting tonight , Cross told himself . I 'm just as complicated as they are ... . " I 'd like to talk to you , " Gil continued , guiding him into the living room . " Let 's sit over here . " Yes , they 've discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my being wanted by the police will make me rest my weary head on their red pillow . . . . A slow tide of confidence and curiosity was seeping into Cross 's consciousness.  | " Sure . Whatever you like , " Cross said , allowing himself to be led to a sofa in the corner of the room . Gil was going to try to recruit him , all right . But this baby does n't know what he 's got hold of tonight , Cross mused ironically . Gil sat opposite Cross and Eva pulled over a chair and sat beside her husband . Bob came in and poured drinks , handed each of them a glass and left . " What are you doing now ? " Gil asked him bluntly . Cross smiled and spread out his hands . " Frankly , nothing . " " How do you live ? " " From hand to mouth . " " Where do you live ? " " On 116th Street in a rented room . " " Are you married ? " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're not prudes or moralists . That 's your business. 1 just wanted to know if you are free  --  " " I 'm quite free , " Cross said readily . He does n't know how free I really am , Cross mused . If he knew he 'd jump out of his skin ... He was not a little shocked at Gil 's colossal self-conceit . He acts like a God who is about to create a man .... He has no conception of the privacy of other people 's lives . . . . He saw Gil 's eyes regarding him steadily , coolly , as though Gil was already seeing to what use his life could be put . " You do n't mind my questioning you like this , do you ? " Gil asked with a cold smile . " No . Why should I ? " Cross lied with friendly unctuousness . " We Communists do not admit any subjectivity in human life , " Gil said with a slow , even smile , as though proud that he could utter such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross said , striving to keep his voice neutral . He was seething with resentment at Gil 's effrontery . Who in hell does he think he is ? He had to brace himself to keep from taking issue not only with Gil 's statement but with the whole attitude toward life implied in it . Cross felt himself slowly coming awake , feeling the real world about him . Here was a challenge the measure of which might meet his needs . . . . Keep still , he told himself . " Do you know anything about the revolutionary movement ? " " I know it sketchily in general outline , from 1917 onward  --  " " Where did you pick it up ? "  | " From books , of course . What do you think ? " Cross had difficulty keeping irritation out of his voice . " Accounts written by counter-revolutionary historians , no doubt , " Gil pronounced placidly . He brought out his pipe and began to fill it leisurely with an aromatic tobacco . Cross had come by his account of the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not bother to correct Gil . He sensed that accuracy was not the point here . Gil was trying to impress him , not with learning , but with an attitude of scorn so deep that argument was futile against it . Instead , he took advantage of Gil 's silence to observe Eva , who sat with her shapely nyloned knees close together and regarded him with wide , enigmatic eyes . When his gaze met hers , she smiled and looked off . She seemed tense , yet rigidly contained . She was a fragile girl of about twentyfour ; her attitude was so distracted that one could feel that she would never speak frankly what was really on her mind . Despite this , she seemed kind , impulsive . Her eyes were a clear hazel ; her nose small and straight ; and her mouth , which was only slightly rouged , was almost severe in its sharpness . The over-all aspect of her face , despite the shadow of a smile that flitted over it now and then , was one of tortured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to be married to a coarse , inhuman character like Blount . Cross now shifted his gaze to Gil and was chagrined to find that Gil had been observing his observation of Eva . Gil smiled tolerantly and Cross found himself boiling with rage . He thinks I 've never met a white girl before ... . Something decisive was transpiring in him regarding Gil . He knew that Gil did not take his inner life into account and he felt compelled to do the same with Gil . This damn thing 's catching , he told himself . You have to descend to their level if you are to deal with them . There 's no other way out . . . . But he really liked this ; there was an absoluteness about it that appealed to him , excited him . To grapple with Gil would involve a total mobilization of all the resourcesof his personality , and the conflict would be religious in its intensity . " What do you think of the position of the Communist Party on the Negro question ? " Gil asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Negro , " Cross replied . " I know that you fight for Negro rights  --  " " I 'm surprised , " Gil said rudely , ignoring what Cross had beenp162about to say . " How can a man of your intelligence afford not to know the most important contribution on the Negro question that has yet been made ? " " Look , Gil , " Cross said in spite of himself ; he had not met this provocative kind of argument before and he felt a desire to plead extenuating circumstances . " I have n't come across this question in a way that would make me want to go into it that deeply . I 'm twentysixyears old and I have n't paid much attention to politics . " " The whole of human life is politics , from the cradle to the grave , " Gil said , sweeping Cross 's explanation into a heap of dust . " For those who do n't know this , so much the worse for them . In England and Germany the ruling classes start training their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the same . That 's why Communistshave something to say about what happens on this earth . Men are not born masters ; they are made into masters . We Communistsunderstand that . And , my friend , it 's time that you understoodit too . History will not respect you nor forgive you for not knowing it . How can you sit there and be indifferent to the forces that shape and control your destiny ? It 's your job to find out how this world is run , Lionel . What do you know about dialectical materialism ? " Cross knew the theory , but he answered : " Nothing . " " Too bad for you , " Gil said ; there was no pity in his voice ; he spoke as though a man as ignorant as Cross did not deserve to live . Cross looked at Eva , whose eyes flittered at once from his face . He clenched his teeth to keep down his anger . His feelings were bridling so that he found himself picking nervously at his lips with his fingernails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different way , was treating him as Bob and Sarah had . How easily he could kill Gil , with no regret ; Gil was making him feel that he was his enemy , not his personal enemy , but his enemy in general and in principle . And at the moment he could think of no words that he could ever muster that would convey to Gil the depth of his rejectionof him . Cross recalled that he had once wished to be a rock that could feel nothing ; well , he had met a man who had apparently tried to turn himself into one . . . . Bob came to the open door , poked his head in , grinned , and asked : " Everything 's all right ? " " We 're doing all right , " Gil told Bob . P163You conceited sonofabitch , Cross told Gil in his mind . Gil leaned back and stared at the ceiling , puffing gently at his pipe . Yes , they are definitely trying to recruit me , Cross mused . But I need them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not ? He could always leave them when he wanted to , could n't he ? And in the meanwhile he would have a chance to establish a new base , a new set of friends . . . . As Cross waited for Gil to speak , he did not let his facial expression betray his acute consciousness of Gil 's consciousness ; through it all he sat listening with a soft , ambiguous smile . But could he , even for the sake of his own selfish ends , stomach this preposterousGil ? " You must never be a victim , " Eva said , stressing the word " vic-tim . " Cross loved her for saying it so sweetly , but hated her assumption of superiority . Yet , in the end it was the soft light in Eva 's eyes that made Cross say at last : " Well , Gil , we 're not all lucky enough to be able to keep abreast of events as well as you do . " " I 'm not keeping abreast of events , " Gil corrected him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the revolutionary movement . Yes , Lionel , you need to stop throwing your life away in individual protests against your exploiters . Pool your strength with your natural allies ; get in the revolutionary movementand soak up the lessons of history . " " I 'd never try to act before knowing what I was about , " Cross told him . " Look , guy , " Gil took his pipe from his mouth and leaned and pointed the stem at him . " I like you , see ? I 've seen you for about ten minutes and I 'm willing to take a chance on you . If I made you a gift , would you accept it ? " Cross smiled and looked at him . These Communists mean business .... " My mother used to tell me : When somebody gives you something , take it ; when somebody takes something away from you , cry , ' " Cross said . Gil managed a wry smile , as though he did not approve of the folk saying because it had n't been sanctioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed delightedly . " I want to send you to the Workers ' School , " Gil said , " at my own expense . But there 's only one catch to my offer .... "   " What 's that ? " " If I stake you to study , then you 'll have to come and live with us . " " Why ? " Cross asked , puzzled . Did this man want him in the same house with a girl as beautiful as Eva ? He was crazy ... . " For many reasons , " Gil explained . " First , I 'd like to keep track of your progress . Second , I want you to help me in a fight against racism which I 'm going to wage in the building in which I live . Third , I want to demonstrate to a certain man , my landlord , who needs to learn a lot , that a Negro is not afraid to live in his building . My landlord 's a Fascist , an open Fascist ! I want you to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cross looked at Eva . " We 'd be happy to have you , " she said ; but she did not smile . Cross sighed . He had not expected this . Well , why not ? This man thinks he is cold ; well , I 'm just as cold as he is ... . " I like to gamble sometimes , " Cross said , rising . " I 'm doing nothing with myself . I 'll take you up on this and see where it leads . About the Fascist , lead me to him . I 've been accused of many things in my life , but no one has yet said that I was afraid . " Gil rose ; he beamed for the first time since he had been in the room and he clapped his hand on Cross 's shoulder . " You 're a man in a million ! That 's the spirit I like to see . " " The freedom of your people ought to be the most precious thing on earth to you , " Eva said solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood to one side and watched them . As if at a signal , Bob and Sarah came into the room ; there was no attempt to conceal the fact that all of them had discussed Cross previously and had decided to make the offer that Gil had tendered him . Bob was jubilant , slapping Cross on the back and telling him : " You ai n't got no worries now , boy . The Party'il take care of you . ... From now on , the Party 's going to be your mother and your father . " Sarah whispered to him , grinning and struggling to repress her laughter : " You 're something new , something special . You can go far with that face of yours . Nobody 'll think you 're up to anything . " Why do they have to crow so openly over me ? Cross asked himself . Though he had agreed to give Gil 's offer a try , he could not avoid feeling cheapened at the way they boasted of how they hadP165been wise enough to know a " good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em how good I am , Cross told himself . Sarah turned and looked at the clock on the mantel ; then she and Bob looked at each other . " Where 's Jack ? " Bob asked . " My dinner 's being ruined , " Sarah complained . " I say let 's eat , " Bob said defiantly . " He knew what time we were eating . " " Ditto , " said Sarah . " I do n't like slaving over a hot stove cooking a good meal and letting it get cold . That Jack Hilton 's always doing that . Who does he think he is ? " " He 's held up at a meeting , " Gil said . " Come on , folks , " Sarah called , beckoning . " Go into the dining room and sit down . " Cross detected in Bob a feeling of hostility toward the absent Jack Hilton and he wondered about it . He joined the others at the dinner table , but even the deliciousness of Sarah 's cooking could not banish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had hauled up out of the sea . Gil downed his food wordlessly , his attention far away . Eva gossiped with Sarah , and Bob ate lustily , now and again looking proudly at Cross . They were eating dessert when the doorbell rang . " That 's Jack , " Sarah said with disgust . " I 'll let ' im in , " Bob said , rising and going to the door . Cross heard Bob greet the new guest : " Hey , Jack ! You 're late . We 're eating dessert . " There was a low rumble of voices in the hallway and then Cross saw a slender white man of about thirty enter the dining room with his overcoat still on . Flakes of melting snow clung to his hat , and a faint haze of vapor , precipitated by the warm air of the apartment , rose from his clothing . His eyes were dark brown , limpid , deep-set , and stared almost unblinkingly . The face was emaciated , the lips thin and hanging slightly open . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sallow . Under his arm he carried a roll of papers which were slightly damp from the weather outside , and he held both of his hands , which had no gloves , clasped tightly in front of him , as though his strained nerves had to have something to hold on to for support . Cross had the impression that a slight emotional push would set him off . No one save Bob had spoken to him and so far he had said nothingP166to anyone . All waited for him to speak . He glanced at Sarah and said dryly : " I 'm sorry I could n't come in time to eat . But I was detainedat the Control Commission . " Sarah forced a smile and mumbled : " That 's all right , Jack . " " The Party comes first , " Bob agreed . " Sit down and have a drink , wo n't you ? " Sarah asked him . " I do n't want a drink , " he said . " I can stay but a minute . In fact , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We can go into the bedroom , " Bob suggested . " No . I can say it right here , " Jack Hilton said in hard , cold , precisetones . He paused and Cross noticed that Hilton 's shoes had cracks in them . The man 's feet must be frozen ... . " Bob Hunter , " Jack Hilton began in a tone that sounded as though he was declaiming a prepared speech , " the Party has decided that you must not proceed any further in your attempt to organize any cells in the Dining Car Waiters ' Union . The Party does not wish to see that task undertaken at this time . You must forthwith desist from all and any activities in that direction . For further instructions , you will report to your Fraction Cell . Is that clearly understood ? " The man 's voice had gradually risen to a high pitch of oratory before he had finished ; Cross felt that the importance of the message did not justify such a method of delivery , but he sensed behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But , man , " Bob protested , " what are you saying to me ? I 'm working at it night and day . " " Then stop it ! " The words shot from Hilton 's mouth . " But , Jack , " Bob yelled , " I already sent out the letters for a meet-ing- " Then send out letters and cancel the meeting ! " Hilton said . " But  --  Man , you do n't know what you 're doing ! I declared myself to ' em in public as a Party member  --  " Hilton took a step closer to Bob , and , taking the papers he had held under his arm , he doubled them in his right fist and slapped them against his leg to underscore each word he spoke . " Hunter , when will you ever learn to respect a decision of the Party ? You do n't discuss decisions of the Party . You obey them ! " " But what am I gon na do ? " Bob wailed . " I want to organize my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Party has altered its decision ! " Hilton stated flatly . " Jack , " Sarah spoke in a low , calm tone of voice , " listen , this is not as easy as you think . Bob has exposed himself as a member of the Party in order to recruit for the Party . Now , if he drops this work , what is he to do ? He ca n't work for the union and he ca n't work for the company . . . . And now you 're telling him he must n't go on working for the Party  --  " " This has nothing to do with you , " Hilton told Sarah . " This decisionis between Hunter and the Party  --  " Sarah leaped from the table and confronted Hilton . " It has something to do with me ! " she blazed . " Bob 's my husband , and what concernshim concerns me ! " " Not in the Party it does n't " Hilton said . " Then Bob 's not going to obey any such damned decision ! " Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dining cars . Now , he 's doing that . Then you say stop . Now , why , why ? " " The Party is not obliged to justify its decisions to you or anybody , " Hilton said . " I 'm gon na keep on organizing , " Bob said uncertainly to Hilton . " Then you will be disciplined , " Hilton said . " What discipline ? What can you do to me ? " Bob asked , his eyes wide with wonder and anxiety . " You can be expelled , " Hilton told him . " And the Party will blacklistyou throughout the labor movement . The Party will kill you . You ca n't fight the Party . Understand that ? " There was silence . Cross looked about the dining room . Gil leaned forward , listening , sucking contentedly at his pipe , his elbows resting on the table . There was a quiet twinkle in his eyes as he looked from Bob to Hilton and back again , following their dialogue . Eva was pale , stiff , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a look that seemed to be protest . Sarah 's eyes were blazing and her chest rose and fell rapidly ; Cross could see the throbbing of a tiny vein in her neck . Bob stood bent forward a little , his lips hangingopen , his eyes wide and glassy . His stance was a combination of subservience and aggression ; it seemed that he was about to bow to Hilton 's demands and yet at the same time he could have been ready to leap forward and grab Hilton 's throat . Cross wondered if it occurred to Bob that he was trying to drag him into an inhumanP168machine like this ... ? Maybe Bob 's mind did not possess enough elasticity to realize it ... ? " But what can I do ? " Bob finally asked in a wail . Gil rose and walked around the table to Bob and pointed the stem of his pipe into Bob 's face . He spoke with jerky authority : " You 're going to be a Bolshevik and obey the Party . " " But my fellow workers 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Bob pointed out . " That does not matter , " Gil said . " You are an instrument of the Party . You exist to execute the Party 's will . That 's all there is to it . " " But I feel  --  " Bob began . " Goddamn your damned feelings ! " Gil spat . " Who cares about what you feel ? Insofar as the Party is concerned , you 've got no damned feelings ! " Gil paused a moment ; there was a look of wild exasperation in his bulbous eyes . " Bob , there 's a hell of a lot you do n't understand . What do you think men like Molotov do when they get a decision ? They carry it out ! Do you think the Party exists to provide an outlet for your personal feelings ? Hell , no ! What do you think the Party would be if this happened ? We 're not Socialists . .. We 're Communists ! And being a Communist is not easy . It means negating yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Party . The Party wants you to obey ! The Party hopes that you can understand why you must obey ; but even if you do n't understand , you must obey . If you do n't , then the Party will toss you aside , like a broken hammer , and seek another instrumentthat will obey . Do n't think that you are indispensable because you 're black and the Party needs you . Hell , no ! The Party can find others to do what it wants ! Is this asking too much ? No . Why ? Becausethe Party needs this obedience to carry out its aims . And what are those aims ? The liberation of the working class and the defense of the Soviet Union . The Party , therefore , does not and can not ask too much of any comrade . It 's logical , is n't it ? The Party is conductingthis fight on your behalf and you must fit into it . Is that clear ? " Bob nodded his head affirmatively and then Gil turned and stared at Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in for could not have happened even if it had been arranged . " Lane , " Gil said . " You are looking at a Party problem . Do you understand it ? "   " I understand it , " Cross said . " I must go , " Hilton said ; he turned and without another word walked out of the room . No one had moved to open the front door for him ; Cross heard it slam shut . He looked at Gil and was astonished to see Gil watching him and smiling . " Do you understand what I mean , Lane , when I say you ca n't earn this out of books ? " " Yes . But listen . I see here two points of view . I see  --  " His eyes caught sight of a gesture of Gil 's hand , a motion that meant for him to remain silent ; Cross knew that Gil did not want him to discuss Bob 's Party problem in front of Bob . " It 's late ! " Gil exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , dear , yes , " Eva said . She turned to Sarah . " Thank you for tile wonderful dinner . " " It 's nothing , " Sarah said ; she could not lift up her eyes . Gil asked Cross , when he was close enough to him to talk in a whisper : " Can I give you a lift to 116th Street ? " " Sure , " Cross said . He longed to talk to Bob , but felt that it would he better to do so without Gil . Bob pretended to be brave ; he grinned , wagged his head , and crooned : " Boy , the Party 's tough , hunh ? It 's a great Party  --  " " That 's the spirit , " Gil said , going for his overcoat . " I do n't like it , " Sarah said , taking a pile of dirty dishes into the kitchen . " She 'll be all right , " Bob apologized for her . " I wo n't be all right ! " Sarah shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darling , let 's go , " Eva said . Cross shook hands with Bob and went to the kitchen door to say good-by to Sarah . The door was closed and when he pushed it open he saw Sarah sitting with her head bowed . Her shoulders were shaking ; she was weeping . She had not heard him open the door , and Cross closed it softly and joined the others . He followed Gil and Eva silently down the stairs to the street . Not a word was spoken until they had all gotten into the car and were rolling over the lumpy drifts of snow . Cross was next to Eva and his nostrils were full of the delicate perfume that she wore . He stared straight ahead of him , feeling that his life had at last touched something that stirred him to his depths . He was not angry or outraged , just deeply thoughtful , P170full of wonder . He had witnessed a scene of naked force in which obedience had been exacted through fear and the intensity of the emotions involved shook him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Gil asked , smiling and looking ahead of him . " It 's interesting , " Cross said ; he did not want to talk now . " Is that all ? " Gil asked , chuckling . " It 's impressive , " Cross conceded . " I did n't expect you to see that tonight , " Gil said soberly . " I 'm just wondering if you understand it correctly . If you got the right interpretation . " " I got the right one , " Cross said tersely . " You have a big future ahead of you , " Eva said in a neutral , farawaytone that made Cross wonder what she meant . " You 'll be all right , " Gil said . " Here 's 116th Street ; you can drop me here , " Cross said , relieved . The car slowed and Gil and Eva looked solemnly at Cross . " Well , Lionel , have you changed your mind ? " Gil asked . " Absolutely not ! " " Then we can expect you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tomorrow . This week ... Whenever you want to come , " Gil said . " Here 's the address . " " I 'll be there about ten in the morning , " Cross said . " I 've one suitcase , that 's all . " " Right , " Gil said . " Good night , Lionel , " Eva said . Gil waved his hand and the car moved off through the dim , snowy streets . Cross stood a moment , looking at its red taillight disappear . He mounted to his room , undressed , and lay on his bed . There was a smile on his face as he stared up into the darkness . They think I 'm a little child , he told himself . I do n't mind the way they act in organizing . I do n't mind the wild way they give out their decisions . I do n't even mind their self-righteousness . But that naked force . . . Why ? At the mere recollection of Hilton 's biting tones , he sucked in his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bob 'll follow any strong person . You can take his hand and lead ' im ... . He sat on the side of the bed ; sleep was far from him . " Once you get that kind of attitude in an organization that goes on from year to year , how can you ever get it out . . . ? " he asked out loud . P171Cross felt that he was at last awaking . The dream in which he had lived since he had fled Chicago was leaving him . The reality about him was beginning to vibrate : he was slowly becoming himself again , but it was a different self . Finally , toward dawn , he turned over on his side and slept like a rock for the first time in many weeks . P172willing to shoulder the handicap . Perhaps we might both misunderstandeach other , he mused . Need for money was not pulling him into this . Nor did he have the itch to right wrongs done to others , though those wrongs did at times agitate him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social wrongs having been done to him ; if any such wrongs had existed , he felt fully capable of righting them by his own lonely strength and effort . It was an emotional compulsion , religious in its intensity , to feel and weigh the worth of himself that was pushing him into the arms of the one thing on earth that could transform his sense of dread , shape it , objectify it , and make it real and rational for him . Logic was guiding his sense of direction , but his emotional needs were dictating the kind of directions he chose . His affinities with the turbulent instincts of Gil and Hilton were undeniable ; he was , in a manner , their brother , just as Ely Houston was his . The difference lay in his violence 's being at bottom sharper and more secretive . He was too full of personal pride to regard himself as an exploited victim ; he did n't demand that he be given his share of a mythical heritage . His was a passion to recast , reforge himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives felt what he was now feeling , that his reaching out for another pitch of consciousness had haunted them just as now it plagued him . But they had resolved their tangled emotions in the rigid disciplines of Communist politics , thereby ejecting from their hearts the pathos of living , purging their consciousness of that perilous subjective tensionthat spells the humanity of man . And now they were warring to slay in others that same agony of life that had driven them to the wall . What malevolent psychological advantages were theirs in the waging of their war ! Who better could track down criminals than reformed criminals ! Gil and Hilton were spiritual bloodhounds on the trail of men whose spirits had not yet been broken as theirs had been . Since they had been defeated , they had decreed that defeat be the lot of all ... . It was not the objective reality of the revolutionary movement that was pulling so magnetically at Cross ; it was something that movementhad and did not know it had that was seducing his attention . It was its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mastered the act of living ; its will that it could define the ends ofP175existence that fascinated him against his volition . Nowhere else save In these realms had he encountered that brand of organized audacity directed toward secular goals . He loathed their knowledge , their manners , their ends ; but he was almost persuaded that they had in tt wrong manner moved in a right direction for revealing the contentof human life on earth . He knew that their bristling economic theories were simply vastly clever fishing nets which they dragged skillfully through muddy social waters to snare the attention of shivering and hungry men ; but many men , the best of them , would yield their allegiances on purely economic grounds and he knew that the Party knew this . While packing his suitcase , he was struck by an idea . Suppose it was right in assuming that the Party was justified in coercing obedience from others purely on the basis of its strength ? What was there , then , to keep an individual from adopting the same policy ? Apparently nothing save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill me if he knew how I felt , " he chuckled , lumberMgdown the stairway with his suitcase . A yellow sun was flooding the buildings with a pale light that had no warmth . He headed for the subway and had gone but ten yards when the image of Bob 's face rose before his eyes . Yes ! How was Bob making out ? Had he kept the Party 's decision ? Instead of going to Gil 's place , he rode uptown and made his way to Bob 's apartment . Bob answered the door . " Speak of the devil ! " Bob greeted him . " Come in , man . We were just talking ' bout you . You got your suitcase  --  Going to Gil 's , huh ? " " Yeah . " Cross looked searchingly at Bob , whose face was a mask of cheerfulness . " You seem all right after what happened last night . " " Yeah , man , " Bob boasted . " That ai n't nothing  --  " " The hell it ai n't ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob became crestfallen at the sound of Sarah 's voice . " Man , Sarah 's mad . Go on in . " Bob followed him and the moment Cross stepped into the living room he saw Sarah 's angry face . " Hey , Pretty , " Sarah greeted him in cold tones . " I thought you were going to laugh at me today , " Cross said . " I ai n't laughing at no sonofabitch today , " Sarah replied . " She do n't understand that the Party has to have discipline , " Bob plained . " Women think we men can do as we like  --  "   " You joined the Party to organize , did n't you ? " Sarah demanded . " Yeah ; sure , Sarah . But listen  --  Lemme explain  --  " " You ai n't explaining nothing ! " Sarah overrode him . " A white man held out a stick to you and said , Jump ! ' And , by God , you jumped , just like any nigger  --  " " Listen , woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's a white man 's Party , ai n't it ? " Sarah demanded . Bob turned to Cross and shook his head helplessly . " Why do n't they want you to go on with your work ? " Cross asked Bob . " He do n't know , " Sarah answered for Bob . " They walk in here and tell ' im what to do , and he hates it , but he obeys ! They do n't even tell ' im why , but he obeys ! " She glared at Bob . " Even in the South when the white folks lynched you , they told you why ! You did n't agree with ' em , but , by God , they told you why ! " " Sarah , " Bob began , " the Party 's an army  --  " " Goddamn your Party ! " Sarah blazed , leaping to her feet . " What in hell did I marry , a Marxist or a mouse ? Listen , nigger , you 're goingto organize , you hear ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionel 's new to the Party  --  " " Let ' im hear it all ! " Sarah yelled . " Let ' im know what he 's getting into . " Bitter tears filled her eyes ; she turned to Cross . " All my life I 've seen niggers knuckling down to white people . I saw my mama knuckling down when I was a child in the South . And nothing hurt me so much as when I saw a white man kick her one day . . . . Know what I mean ? Kick her ! I said kick her with his goddamn foot . I was ' bout six ; mama was serving in the white man 's house ; I was watchingfrom the kitchen door . Mama tripped and fell with the tray and boiling soup splashed all over her . But the white man was n't worried ' bout that . Hell , naw ! He was mad ' cause his dinner was spoiled , so he kicked her . It 'll stay in my mind till my dying day .... And everywhere I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking niggers who are kneeling down .... Know why I do n't go to church , Lionel ? ' Cause I have to kneel in front of that white priest , and I 'll be goddamned if I 'll do it . Now , we 're in the revolution and the same goddamn white man comes along . But he 's in the Party now . " " Baby , it 's different , " Bob wailed . " Do n't tell me it 's different ; it 's the same damn thing ! " Sarah sat heavily in a chair and her head dropped ; she seemed ashamed ofP177outburst . " Maybe the Party wanted you to expose yourself that y , " she began again in a reflective tone . " You 're no good to the on , you 're no good to the company , and , if you do n't obey the ty , you 're no good to them . They got you trapped  --  " " Sarah , " Bob spoke solemnly . " A good Bolshevik obeys . Lenin yed , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sarah sneered at him , " I want you to be one of . m who tells the others to obey , see ? Read your Marx and orize . That scares you , do n't it ? They done put the fear of God in soul ! " She rose again , trembling with anger . " Listen , I 'm workandhelping to support you to organize ! I 'm feeding you to anize ! Now , you either organize or go ! " She whirled to Cross . w Party scared the pee out of him this morning . He went to the itrol Commission to find out why they did n't want him to go on th his work . When he got back here , he was sick  --  " " I was n't sick , " Bob protested , ashamed that Cross should know . " You looked green , " Sarah said . " And when a man as dark as you ks green , he 's sick ! " Bob grabbed his head with his hands , sank into a seat ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering , a wet rag flopping between rah and the Party . Cross was unable to look at him ; he stared out the window . " What are you going to do , Bob ? " Cross asked patiently . " Hell , man . I do n't know , " Bob sighed . " What do you want to do ? " Cross asked . Bob 's eyes searched Cross 's face as though seeking an answer ' ere ; he licked his lips and mumbled despairingly : " I want to organize Negroes  --  " " Well , why do n't you ? " " You reckon I could do it ? Reckon I ought to ? " he asked sheepishly . " You ought to do what you want to do , " Cross told him . Sarah watched Bob with the cold eyes that only a woman can have for her husband . Cross knew that Bob would never win . Bob was too scared to act alone ; he had to have a master . The Party had sunk its hold deep in Bob 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to find another ... . " I 'm gon na stick to my own people , " he said heavily , his eyesP178glistening . He had run from one master to another : his race . " That ' what I 'm gon na do . " " Then , do it , Bob , " Cross said . " I 'll help you . " " You want to help organize Negroes ? " Bob asked eagerly , jumpin : , to his feet . " No . I want to help you . " Cross told him in clipped tones . Bob was puzzled ; he brushed the meaning in Cross 's words aside He paced nervously with eyes full of anxiety . " One thing 's got m : worried , " he mumbled . " The Party knows I 'm illegally in this coup try  --  " " So what ? " Sarah asked . " Supposed they turn me in to the Immigration folks to get rid o me  --  ? " " The Communists ? " Cross asked . " Sure , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they fight with everything . " " They would n't dare , " Sarah said . Cross felt that Bob 's worries were farfetched . After all , was Bob that important to the Party ? He rose to leave and Bob grabbed his hand in gratitude . Sarah followed him to the door . As Cross descendedthe stairs he wondered why some men wanted to be free and some did not , why some needed freedom and others did not even feel its loss when they did not have it . After witnessing Bob 's turmoil , he had doubts about going to Gil 's . Was n't Gil another Hilton ? And why did the Party demand abject obedience ? He recalled Bob 's having told him that the Party was " now your mother and your father , " which meant that if he obeyed , the Party would take care of him , but , if he disobeyed , the Party would destroy him . And he did n't have the right to know why he was obeying . . . Why blind obedience ? Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Party 's demand for it . If no reasons are assigned for a given command , then you can not criticize , for you do not understand what you are doing . And if obediencewithout reasons is demanded for little things , it would hold , as a matter of ingrained habit , for bigger and more dangerous things . ... But why had the Party chosen that procedure ? Had they found that men would not obey otherwise ? That could hardly be true , for each day millions of southern Negroes obeyed southern whites ; millions of South African natives obeyed the white powers above ; millions of Germans had obeyed Hitler ; and in most cases millions had been given some fantastic excuse to justify the summand of obedience . The Nazis tried to win the loyalty of their Subjects by conferring upon them ornate titles , noneconomic rewardsof various sorts , and by devising schemes of sport and joy . lint the only motive that Hilton had held out to Bob was fear . Did the . Communists prefer fear ? He sighed and glanced out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train was slowing for his stop . Well , the answers to his questions were in Gil 's apartment ... The Blounts lived in a sparsely furnished , seven-room apartment aoo the second floor of a red brick building on Charles Street . Eva was not in and Gil received Cross with determined stolidity . The questions that had thronged Cross 's mind were now informing his sensibilities . If there was something here to understand , then he , Gross , would get it . " How are you ? " Gil asked offhandedly . " Fine . " " Follow me , " Gil said , heading down a narrow hallway . Gil showed him a small room overlooking a depressing stretch of straggling wooden fences separating back yards . " Will this suit your needs ? " Gil asked . " Certainly . " " Leave your suitcase and let 's have some beer , " Gil said and left . Cross placed his suitcase in a corner and walked slowly down the hallway , passing first what was obviously Gil 's bedroom , then Eva 's bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finally conning to the kitchen , in which Gil stood pouring beer into two tall glasses . " You get the layout of the place ? " Gil asked without looking und . " Yes ; I see it . " He knows I 've looked the joint over ... . " The bathroom is next door , " Gil said . He pointed to a rear doorIn the kitchen . " That 's Eva 's studio . She paints , you know . " " Oh ; I did n't know , " Cross said . " She 's a good painter , " Gil told him . " Now , follow me . " Gil took the glasses into the living room and set one glass for Toss and another for himself on the end tables by two easy chairs . Cross noticed the slow precision with which Gil moved .   " You 're observant , " Gil observed . " Just a habit , " Cross said . When they were seated , Gil studied Cross silently for some se onds , took a swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glowing red . He held the burnt-out match delicately in his fingers then laid it aside carefully in an ashtray . Why does he act like that Cross asked himself . Or , maybe he was observing the man to closely ? He acts like he wants to mesmerize me ; if he does , he cer tainly picked the wrong subject ... . " Did anyone see you come up ? " Gil asked . " Not a soul . Why ? " Gil did not answer ; he acted as though he had not heard . " I 'd like for you to sit around for a week , go to meetings , listen a bit before you start your studies in the Workers ' School , " Gil said . " Just as you say , " Cross agreed . Gil rose and went to his bookcase and took down a volume parted the leaves to a certain page , and stood reading for some minutes , puffing slowly on his pipe . He finally sat and spoke whil looking out of the window . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes here in Greenwich Village , " Gil explained . " There is no law against Negroes living anywhere in this city they want to , but landlords have banded together and made codes against Negroes . One of the leading supporters of this code is the man who lives downstairs ; he is my landlord . " Gil 's attitude began to assume a pattern of meaning . Cross re called that Gil had asked him if he had been observed by anyone on his entering the building , and when he had told Gil that no one had seen him and had asked Gil to explain why he had asked such a question , Gil had remained silent . It was clear that Gil was jealouslyreserving to himself the right to tell Cross the facts in his own way , to paint the entire picture , put in the shadings , the interpretations , the sense of direction . And the words Cross heard would constitutea law which he had to memorize carefully . . . . But why ? Cross asked himself . Let him come out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough fight , " Gil went on . " We 'll be attacking the most deeply entrenched money interests in this city . The man downstairs is called Langley Herndon ; he 's an ex-real-estate broker ; he 's now retired . He 's a dyed-in-the-wool Negro hater . He has toldP181me that if he had his way , he 'd kill every Negro he could lay his hands on ... . " Now , here 's our strategy . He 's going to know soon enough that you 're living in my apartment , and the moment he knows , trouble will start . Just enter and leave the building normally . Maintain a polite attitude toward everyone you meet . We must n't let any side Issues develop here ; we must n't give anybody a chance to say that you were rude or insulting to them ; understand ? Be reserved . If this Herndon should speak to you , and he will , just act as if you were not aware of trespassing his racial boundaries . Let him take the offensive in every instance , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lionel , I have a lease .... " He paused and pulled a batch of papers out of his inside coat pocket . " It 's drawn between you and me . The lease I hold with Herndon gives me the right to sublet in whole or in part . Now , the lease I want you to sign was drawn up by a Party lawyer . This whole plan has been most carefully mapped out . Your staying here is perfectly legal ; not only human and decent , but legal . " Now , armed with this lease , Herndon has no real recourse to law to throw you or me out . But , of course , he has his goons , his tough boys who may try to waylay you . The cops will be on his side ; make no mistake about that . " Now , let me tell you the kind of man this Herndon is . I said last night that he was a Fascist . He is . I 'm not understating it . Herndon began his life as a Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the old-fashioned American racist notions , all of them , right up to the hilt , including the so-called biological inferiority of the Negro . He even claims that he has found a philosophical basis and justificationfor his racial hatred . Understand ? He hates not only Negroes , Jews , Chinese , but all non-Anglo-Saxons . . . . And he is smart enough to give you a mile of specious arguments , gotten out of crackpot books , for his anti-Semitism , anti-Negroism , and the rest . All of his arguments boil down to this : God made him and his kind to rule over the lower breeds . And God was so kind and thoughtful as to arrange that he be paid handsomely for it . Of course , he has conceived this God of his in the image of a highly successful oil or real-estate man , just a little more powerful and wonderful than he is . Herndon is quite anxious to collaborate with God by shouldering a rifle , if necessary , and helping God to defend what God has soP182generously given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what he 's got , but he does not completely trust God ' judgment when it comes to his keeping it . " As soon as he knows that you 're in the building , the entire neigh borhood will know it . That ought to happen within the next fe hours . From that moment on , you 'll have to watch out . Now , I 'm get ting you a gun and a permit to carry one .... " " I 've got a gun , " Cross told him . " But no permit . " Gil frowned and studied the floor . " How long have you carried gun ? " " A few weeks . Especially when I travel  --  " " You carry it on you ? " " Yes . " " May I see it ? " Cross tendered Gil his gun and Gil broke it , copied down the serial number and returned it . " A Party contact will help get you a permit , " Gil continued , but the tone of his voice had changed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've acted in a way to make him trust me , to make him feel that he is the boss ; but my having a gun makes him feel that I might have a will of my own .... " If and when Herndon moves against us , " Gil resumed , " we 'll break the case in the Daily Worker ; we 'll break it in England , in France , in China , and the Soviet Union  --  " " You do n't think a court would uphold your lease ? " Cross asked . Gil seemed annoyed . He gazed down at the figures in the carpet for a moment . " Lionel , courts are instrumentalities of bourgeois law , " he said slowly . " We are going to try this case in the public mind . Above all , this case must serve the Party 's organizational interests . " Cross was worried . What would the publicity mean for him ? Should he tell Gil that he could n't risk that ? No , he would wait ; ho could always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Are you in agreement with this plan ? " Gil asked . " Of course , " Cross lied . " Then tell me what you would think of anyone who tried to defeatthis fight for Negroes to live where they want to ? " Gil asked slowly . P183Why , " Cross stammered , " he 'd be a sonofabitch , to say the least . " Gil did not react to this definition . He stared straight at Cross d then leaned back in his chair . His pipe had gone out and he lit it . Suddenly Gil 's eyes seemed to become unseeing . " He would be a counter-revolutionary , " Gil pronounced at last . And he would deserve to be destroyed by the Party . " Gil 's words made Cross at last understand what had been botheringhim all along . It came in the tone of Gil 's words , in the chilledpromise of cold vengeance that edged his voice . Power ! This waswer he saw in action . That was why Gil had evaded answering is questions ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to be told what to do . The meaning unfolded like thepetals of a black flower in the depths of a swamp . That was why ear was used ; that was why no rewards of a tangible nature were iven . It worked like this : Gil could lord it over Cross ; and , in turn , his payment for his suffering Gil 's domination , Cross could lord it over somebody else . It was odd that he had not sensed it before ; it had been too simple , too elementary . His mind worked feverishly , analyzing the concept . Here was something more recondite than mere political strategy ; it was a life strategy using political methods as its tools . . . . Its essence was a voluptuousness , a deep-going sensualitythat took cognizance of fundamental human needs and the answers to those needs . It related man to man in a fearfully organic way . To hold absolute power over others , to define what they should love or fear , to decide if they were to live or die and thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensuality that made sexual passion look pale by comparison . It was a noneconomic conception of existence . The rewards for those followers who deserved them did not cost one penny ; the only price attached to rewards was the abject suffering of some individual victim who was dominated by the recipient of the reward of power . . . . No , they were not dumb , these Gils and Hiltons . . . . They knew a thing or two about mankind . They had reached far back into history and had dredged up from its black waters the most ancient of all realities : man 's desireto be a god . . . . How far wrong most people were in their appraisalof dictators ! The popular opinion was that these men were hankering for their pick of beautiful virgins , good food , fragrant cigars , aged whisky , land , gold .... But what these men wanted was something much harder to get and the mere getting of it was in it-P184self a way of keeping it . It was power , not just the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wielded directly upo the lives and bodies of others . He recalled now how Hilton and G had looked at Bob when Bob had pleaded against the Party 's decision . They had enjoyed it , loved it ! " Do you understand ? " he heard Gil asking him . Cross sighed , looked up and met Gil 's eyes with a level stare ' " Yes , I understand , " he said . He understood now why Gil had moved so slowly , why his mane ner was so studied . He had been giving Cross a chance to observer And he remembered that Gil had been watching him to see that he was watching ! The heart of communism could not be taught ; it had to be learned by living , by participation in its rituals . He heard a key turning in the lock of the door . " That 's Eva , " Gil said . A moment later Eva , wind-blown and cherry-cheeked , with an armful of packages , rushed into the room . Her face held a bright , fixed expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her nervous , high-strung way . Cross stood and smiled at her and wondered if her strained man  --  ner was covering her distaste at his presence in the apartment ... There was something in her attitude that bothered him . " Thank you , " he told her . " I 'm here and we 're planning  --  " " And you 'll get action , " Eva promised him self-consciously . " If Gil planned it , it 's really planned . Huh , darling ? " She bent and kissed Gil lightly on the forehead . " I must get lunch ready now . " She turned to Cross . " Just make yourself at home . " " Oh , Eva , " Gil called . " I 'm not eating lunch in . In fact , I must leave now . Why do n't you eat with Lionel ? I 've got to make a speech at the Dyers ' Union . I 'll be in for dinner . " " Very well , Gil , " Eva said ; her face showed no expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , boy . " He laughed for the first time . " The fight is on ! " Eva walked slowly into the hallway and a moment later Cross heard her rattling pots and pans in the kitchen . Gil got into his overcoat and left . Cross went to his room and stretched out on his bed , thinking , mulling . His was the hungry type of mind that needed only a scrap of an idea to feed upon to start his analytical processes rolling . This thing of power ... Why had he overlooked it till now ? P185Well , he had not been in those areas of life where power had held forth or reigned openly . Excitement grew in him ; he felt that he was beginning to look at the emotional skeleton of man . He understood now the hard Communist insistence on strict obedience in things that had no direct relation to politics proper or to their keeping tight grasp of the reins of power . Once a thorough system of sensual power as a way of life had gotten hold of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his relations , it was bound to codify and arrange all of his life 's activities into one organic unity . This systematizingof the sensual impulses of man to be a god must needs be jealous of all rival systems of sensuality , even those found in poetry and music . Cross , lying on his bed and staring at the ceiling , marveled at the astuteness of both Communist and Fascist politicianswho had banned the demonic contagions of jazz . And now , too , he could understand why the Communists , instead of shooting the capitalists and bankers as they had so ardently sworn that they would do when they came to power , made instead with blood in their eyes straight for the schoolteachers , priests , writers , artists , poets , musicians , and the deposed bourgeois governmental rulers as the men who held for them the deadliest of threats to their keeping and extending their power ... . He saw now that those who , in trying to rationalize their fears of communism , had said that the practice of communism was contrary to human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't the courage to admit ; for , as Cross could see , there was not perhaps on earth a system of governing men which was more solidly built upon the sadly embarrassing cupidities of the human heart and its hunger to embrace the unembraceable . And this system of sensualizationof the concept of power was n't restricted to the Coin-1nunist or Fascist worlds ; the Communists had merely rationalized it , brought it nakedly into the open . Cross began to see that this systematization of the sensuality of power prevailed , though in a different form , in the so-called capitalistic bourgeois world ; it was everywhere , in religion as well as in government , and in all art that was worthy of the name . And bourgeois rulers , along with the men of the church , had forged through time and tradition methods of concealing these systems of sensual power under thick layers of legal , institutionalized , ritualized , ideological , and religious trappings . But at the very heart of this system were the knowing andp186conscious men who wielded power , saying little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they practiced , the nameless religion by which they lived . IIe knew instinctively that such subjects could not readily be exploredin discussions with others , for its very victims  --  if , in strict sense it could be said that they were victims  --  would deny its reality perhaps more vociferously than those who controlled this system of power . Cross 's insight into men like Gil or Hilton enabled him to isolate his own past actions and gain some measure of insight into them ; it had been the blind coercions of a hungry sensuality that had made him try to hug delusions to his heart when he had suspectedmalevolence in the innocent and had tried to credit the unknowingwith motives that they could not possibly have had . He rolled over and sat up in bed , his mouth open . He was seeing a vision , but at long last it was not an unreal one . This vision made reality more meaningful , made what his eyes saw take on coherence and depth . For the first time since that snowy evening in Chicago when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drained off the world and had left it dry of interest , meaning began to trickle back again . . . . He was , in his mind and feelings , isolating this central impulse of informing action by which he and other men lived . There was a hunger for power reaching out of the senses of man and trying to say something in symbols of action . What message , if any , was written in those hieroglyphics of energy ? These actions were far more basic than the economic relations between rival social classes , he was convinced . Maybe .. . A light knock came upon his door . " Lionel ! " It was Eva calling . " Yes ? " " Lunch is waiting " Coming . " He washed up and went into the dining room and sat at the table facing Eva , who now , though friendly , still seemed to avoid his eyes . " I do n't know what you like to eat , " she said , smiling . " Anything 'll do me , Eva , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ponderous reflections of a moment ago . " I suppose you and Gil went over a lot today . You 'll see that Gil has a grip on life , " she said in a strained matter-of-fact tone devoid of any boasting .   " He has indeed , " Cross agreed merely to keep the talk going . As she served him he studied her and was amazed to find that she looked even younger without rouge on her lips and cheeks . How did this child  --  for there was an undeniable childishness about her  --  fit into his dark broodings and interpretations of Gil 's politics ? He longed to ask her how she had come to marry Gil , for every move she made and every word she uttered belied her being his wife . " Are you a native New Yorker ; that is , born here , I mean ? " he asked . " Yes ; I 'm one of those rare ones . I was born about three blocks from here , " she said , laughing , keeping her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party ? " " Oh , God no . I was an orphan .... I encountered the Party when I met Gil . " She still did not look at him . " Oh , I see . " " Do you like music ? " she asked . He had hoped that she would discuss politics ; but either she did n't want to or she evaded the subject because it did n't interest her . " It 's the one thing I know least about , I 'm ashamed to admit , " he confessed . " I 've heard some classical music and liked it ; but my level is jazz and folk songs , I 'm afraid . " " Really ? " She was surprised and thoughtful for a moment . " The reason I asked is that we have stacks of symphonic records in the living room and you 're free to play them if you like . " As the lunch progressed , she spoke in a quietly melodious voice of her love of music , painting , poetry , and the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , she avoided all mention of herself and made no political observations at all . The simplicity of her manner made him doubt the validity of the theory lie had hatched out a few minutes ago . Yet she lives in the Communistworld and she must know , he thought . " Say , what was behind that little scene at Bob 's last night ? " he asked boldly . " What scene ? " She looked startled . " Hilton 's laying down the law to Bob  --  " " Oh , that . . . " She frowned and murmured . " I 'm afraid that Gil will have to explain that . " Either she did not know or she did not want to tell . He didn'tP188want to create the impression that he was fishing for information so he quickly assumed an attitude of naivete " There 's so much to learn , " he said wistfully . " I must be patient . " " I was once as bewildered as you are , " she said meaningfully . It was definite that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he cast about for a way to make her open up . " Look , do n't think I 'm nosy , but are you active in the Party ? " " Not exactly , " she said . " I paint . " She was frowning . " Oh , really ? Social subjects ? " A flicker of dismay darted across her face . She 's afraid to talk , he thought . She bit her lips and her long eyelashes shadowed her cheeks . She took up a slice of bread , broke it nervously , then put it aside as a sudden impulse came to life in her . " No . I 'm a nonobjective painter , " she said modestly . Cross stared . The wife a Communist leader painting nonobjec-tively ? " You do n't like nonobjective painting , do you ? " she asked , putting a soft challenge in her voice . " But I do ; what I 've seen of it , " he answered honestly . " Not many people do , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are so realistic and drenched in life , the world . . . . Colored people are so robustly healthy . " " Some of us , " he said . " And you 're not ? How did that happen ? " " It 's a long story , " he said . " Some people are pushed deeper intotheir environment and some are pushed completely out of it . " " Do you feel that much aloneness ? " she asked in surprise . " Yes ; and you ? " " Yes , " she said simply and was silent . " I 'd like to see your work . " " All right . But . . . " " But what ? " " I 'd rather you did n't tell Gil we talked about this , " she said , flushing . " I see , " he said . What 's she afraid of ? After lunch she took him into a cluttered , dusty room behind the kitchen ; it reeked of oil and turpentine . She stood timidly behind him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacked in corners . The odd power of her work was immediately apparent ; P189Cross saw a bewildering array of seemingly disassociated forms  --  squares , cubes , spheres , triangles , rhombs , trapezes , planes , spirals , crystals , meteors  --  struggling in space lit somberly by achromatic tints . He advanced to the canvas on which she was evidently workingand which rested upon a huge easel . Out of a darkly brooding background surged broken forms swimming lyrically in mysterious light stemming from an unseen source . The magical fragility of this light , touching off surprising harmonies of tones , falling in space and bringing to sight half-sensed patterns of form , was like Eva herself , like her sense of herself . In her work she seemed to be straining to say something that possessed and gripped her life . " Have you exhibited ? " " Yes ; last year . Just before I married  --  " " You have enough for another exhibit now . " " I sha n't exhibit again soon , " she said . " How was your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And why are n't you going to exhibit again soon ? " " Oh , Lionel , I must go , " she said hurriedly , ignoring his question . " Stay and look at them as long as you like . . . . Here are the keys to the apartment ; one 's for the downstairs and the other 's for the I ront door up here . I 'm off to do some shopping and then I 'll do a concert . " She flashed him a quick smile . " Come and go as you like . But watch for Herndon downstairs .... " She left him and a few moments later he heard the front door open and close . She had not wanted to talk to him , but what she had seemed too shy to say in words shouted and pleaded for her in images . For two hours he looked at every canvas in the room , placingthem in the light , examining them from far and near . He had t he illusion , while studying them , of standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured by the private , subjective world that was hers , a world that was frightening in the stark quality of its aloneness ; and he knew that it was out of a sense of aloneness that these haunted images , nameless and timeless , had come with the force of compulsions . At least she 's lucky to be able to say her terrors and agonies in form and color , he said a little enviously to Ii imseif . With a cigarette glowing in his lips , he went back into the apartWentand wandered aimlessly from room to room , probing and idlyp190searching . He smiled , feeling the presence of Eva and Gil as he spied among their belongings . Why did they have separate bedrooms ? Twin beds were all right , but two bedrooms ? He recalled the little , pecking kiss that Eva had given Gil when she had come in from her shopping and he was certain that there was something wrong between them . He ended up in Eva 's bedroom , prowling in drawers and desks . At the bottom of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a clothes closet he came across a stack of bound notebooks ; he opened one . They were Eva 's diaries . . . . He glanced guiltily over his shoulder . When would she be back ? To be caught reading her diary would be awful .... He stepped into the hallway and saw that there was a safety night chain on the door . He put the chain in place . If Gil or Eva returned suddenly , he would say he had put it on in case Herndon came up . . . . He went back into Eva 's bedroom and picked up a volume of the diary that dated back six months of that year . He began reading the small , clear , schoolgirlish hand-writing : June 10th  --  I 'm at last in Paris , city of my dreams ! What a wedding gift from Gil ! Poor dear , he 's too busy with Party work to show me the beauty of this wonderful Paris ; his assignments keep him going from morning till night . But I do manage to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' studios , the sense of leisure , the love of beauty  --  will I ever be myself again after all this ? Notre Dame ! Rising nobly in the warm summer night like a floodlit dream  --  The tourist bus is crawling away , taking from me this vision of beauty , remote , fragile , infused with the mood of eternity . At the next stop I got off the bus and walked back to Notre Dame ; I could not keep to the schedule of a tourist bus ! I sat on a bench and gazed at Notre Dame till almost dawn . How quiet the city is . A lonely , shabby man is pushing a handcart through the city streets . Lines , space , harmony softenedby dark mists . . . Dusk of dawn kissing the pavements with tenderness . . . I doubt if Gil would understand feelings like these , yet they mean so much to me , to my heart . Mine is the glory of those angels against the background of that pearly , infinite sky . June 15thI 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this my honeymoon ? Is it possible that Gil has betrayed me so cruelly , so cynically ? ForP191days now I 've pretended to be ill to avoid having it out with him , but in the end I must do it . It all began that afternoon when I went to see a Loft Bank art exhibit . I stayed behind and got to talking to some of the younger artists , both American and French , all of whom were complete strangers to me . One young man , an American expatriate , obviously a Trotskyite , began a violent tirade against the Party , charging that membership in the Party was death to artists . I told him that I was a painter and did not think so . He then told me not to be naive like that Eva Blount who had had such a stunningly successful exhibit in New York last spring . He did n't know who I was , and I asked him what was so naive about Eva Blount . He said that it was common knowledge in radical circles that Gil Blount had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Party for prestige purposes . He went on talking of other instances where such had happened . I was silent ; I felt cold , dead . To stand in a crowd of people and hear them talk of you like that ! ! ! I asked him how he knew this , and what right he had to spread such foul gossip about people he did not know . He then went on to tell things which only someone close to the revolutionary movement could know . He said that Gil 's secretary , Rose Lampkin , was his mistress and had been for years , and that at the same time she was spying on Gil . I could not contradict him . To hear one 's private life spoken about so brutally , in public ! God , it ca n't be true ! Yet his words explain so much . Is that why Gil is away from home so much ? Is that why he never comes to me except when he 's drunk ? Oh , God , I feel I 've no ground under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ... . And that Rose Lampkin woman , Gil 's secretary . . . Is she his mistress ? Is that why he insisted that she accompany us to Paris ? The more I think , the sicker I get . I try to tell myself that this can not be true , yet in my heart I know it and feel it . June 17thGil has all but said that it 's true . Which means that when I confronted him , he would not say anything . He raves at me , telling me that I 'm trying to undermine his Party position , that I 'm slandering him . I asked him to send Rose back to New York , and he said that it was the Party 's decision that Rose remain with him . And Rose , when she came to the hotel this morning , had a cold smirk on her face . She knows that I know , According to Gil , I must accept this betrayal and be loyal to the Party ; to be loyal to my feelings means betraying the Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that everybody 's laughing at me , that everybody knowsI could kill Gil . P192I must be calm  --  I 've only my work left ; that 's all . I tell myself all day long that I must give my life to my work . If I make a sudden , hysterical move I 'll lose my grip on myself . Gil has predicted as much . Can there be betrayals as intimately cynical as this ? I 'm a fool to wonder , for it is true , it stares me in the face . But I do n't want to believe it . That 's what makes it possible ; no one wants to believe it . What coldness people are capable of ! I walk the streets all day to keep thoughts of suicide from filling my headJune 19thMy whole life seems tainted , unclean .... I 've asked Gill to take me back to New York ; he says he will as soon as his duties with the French Party are over . I begged him to give me the fare , and he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the orphans ' home . I did n't lose heart then and I must n't now . I wo n't ; I ca n't give up ; I must work , work , work , paint .... But can I paint again ? Gil warned me that I must not talk of this . He demanded to know who told me about the Party deciding that he was to marry me . He accuses me of having anti-Party friends . I 'm afraid . If I stay with Gil , I 'll loathe myself ; if I run off , the Party will attack me publicly , branding me a renegade . All of my friends are Party people and they would no longer speak to me . Night and day Gil demands that I be loyal to the Party . But I owe myself some loyalty too . How can I face myself in the years to come , knowing that I have been bought , and in such a shameful way ? Gil says that my personal feelings do not count . Does n't he know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no doubt about it . I stand before my easel and can not paint . I 'm numb ; my love of work is gone . When Gil comes into the hotel room , I begin to tremble with shame and rage . And he tells me that I must not , can not talk to anybody . If I protest , the Party will destroy me . . . . Last night he relented a tiny bit and said that I could be free only if I let the Party choose a husband for me . It seems that I 'm guilty not because of what I 've done , but because of what I know . June 21stI 've begun to notice things that I 've never noticed before . Is this because of what Gil and the Party have done to me ? I feel like a victim and everywhere I look I think I can see other victims in the making . . . . P193I 've just come from an American movie where I saw mothers with their young children . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can mothers take their children into such places ? I should hate to have my children getting used to sights of violence , death , brutality . When for years a child has seen men hitting other men , killing or getting killed , he gets used to it . In time it does not impress him any more , and death , betrayal , deception become just unimpressive facts of life , just " one of those things . " .. . June 23rdGil came in at 2 A.M. , drunk . He 's ashamed to face me when he 's sober . I understand it : drunk , he 's still a free Communist ; sober , he 's still a slave of his boyhood upbringing in the Bronx and is ashamed of what he 's done . To every argument I raise , he has one answer : " You do n't understand ! " I 've got a knife with which I cut canvases and I sleep with it under my pillow . Gil will never touch me again , drunk or sober . My eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'd be brought to this . Before the world was a sad place , but now it 's both sad and dangerous . The worst part of all this is that I 've no preparation for it ; there was no warning . There 's nothing I 've ever read or heard that could have prepared me for this . . . . After father died when I was six , I lived in that orphans ' home ; but even there life seemed rational . hunger , cold , study ; making sacrifices to attend art school  --  all of that was rational . When I began to win scholarships , all the deprivations were redeemed . But this deliberate deception  --  ? Where does it fit in ? Gil is sullen , silent ; a cold wall  --  He has his friends ; I 'm alone  --  I 've no friends unless I consent to accept what has been done to me ! I must he a partner to this crime in order to be forgiven ! I see it now ; there can be no crimes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My fear to talk , my silence makes this possible ! But dare I speak ? Who would believe me ? Who 'd care ? How can I go on like this ? June 24thI 'm afraid my loneliness and melancholy are making me morbid . Injusticehas always been merely a word to me , now it 's a reality . Gil and the Party have opened my eyes and I see . . . . In the Paris Metro today I saw something that made me sad . In front of me , on one seat , sat a young mother , middle class , her face well made-up and glowing with motherly pride ; she was holding a little girl about two years old on her knees . And that sweet little baby girl , all dressed up in delicate , lacy things took a liking to a pale little boy of about nine or thereabouts . HeP194was filthy , badly dressed ; he seemed too mature for his age ; he sat next to a huge , vulgar , toothless , harsh-voiced woman  --  no doubt his mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , but the big woman kept telling her son to stop looking and smiling at the baby . The little girl 's hands tried to take hold of those of the boy and the boy was enjoying it . The young mother did not like it , but she was too well bred to want to hurt the little boy 's feelings . Maybe the big woman was afraid of what the smartly dressed young woman would say ? Anyway , the two women got terribly nervous and finally the young mother pried the tiny , playful , rosy little fingers out of the boy 's dirty hands . The baby cried and I wanted to cry too  --  I wonder if Gil realizes how awful people can feel when something happens to them that they can not understand ? I 've sworn that Gil will never touch me again . I 'll die first ! July 10thWe 're back in New York . My friends are asking me about my honeymoonand I 'm forced to smile . God , how can I keep up this deception any longer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of colored people . God , how they take it ! Compared to their deception , mine is nothing . Yet they manage to go on living , even smiling . How do they do it ? They must be strong , healthy , unspoiled by the lies of the white man 's world . July 12thMy world has failed me and everything in it . . . . What Gil and his Party have done to me is ruining my life , making me possess fantastic notions . My loathing of Gil has gone so far that I can not any longer abide the color pink . I no longer want to paint in reds and blues and greens . They now remind me of Gil 's deception . That 's why I 'm beginning to adore colored people ; I could live my life with sunburnt people ; I wish I was a warm , rich , brown colorJuly 18thI 've begged Gil for a little money to start out for myself and he says no ; the Party says no ; it 's no everywhere ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly a Fascist ! This morning I met him on the stoop and said good morning to him . For some reason I asked him if there were any black people in the neighborhood . He must have thought that I objected to them , for he said : " Oh , no ; nothing like that around here , lady . But there 's a Chinese laundry down the street  --  " " But Chinese are n't black , " I said . " Oh , lady , you do n't know . They 're almost black . These colored people are all the same . P195God 's marked ' em all red , yellow , brown , and black so we could know ' cm . " Good God , what a world we live in ! Cross smiled and flipped the pages of the diary and began readingthe last entry : March 3rdBob Hunter , one of the Party organizers , came rushing in to see Gil . When I told him that Gil was out his face fell and he pouted like a child . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight and free his people from oppression . Bob told me to tell Gil that we must be sure to come to his apartment for dinner tonight  --  Bob bubbles over with the news of his finding a new , wonderful recruit for the Party . He is a young Negro living under an assumed name , a fugitive from Southern racists . Ile is , according to Bob , who swore me to secrecy , a bright young Negro intellectual who had some dire trouble with whites and committed some crime and is in hiding to save his life . Bob met the young man on a train and he is certain that he has killed a white man and that there is a price on his head . It sounds so exciting , terrible , pitiful .... And they 're bringinghim into the Party ! Another victim ? I wish I could talk to him and tell him something . Colored people are so trusting and naive . He 's going to be misled by Gil , just as I have been ... . Cross closed the diary ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew enough to make a numbing sense of recognition go through him . Impulsively he wanted to run to her and talk to her , to tell her that she was not alone . But that was foolish . Secrecy was how the world was run . Millions felt alike , but were afraid to admit it . I Jere was a lost woman who had enough sensitivity and intelligence to understand what he had to say . She was a victim like him ; the difference was that he was a willing victim and she was an involuntaryone . . . . She protested and he said yes . And a world yawned between his yes and her no ... . But , Christ , how could she go on living that life ? Her tense , artificialmanner was now clear . She did not want to talk about politics ; she was afraid of what she would say . . . . She wanted to help him ; and he wanted to help her ... . And Gil. was trusting him because of Bob 's foolish stories ! Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that it had found a real victim of race hate ! Well .. . He felt sluggish ; he replaced the diary and decided to take aP196walk . He went out of the front door , listening to hear a harsh voice challenging him . But nothing happened . He ambled to Washington Square and stood looking at the pigeons fluttering around the trees , alighting in the snowy grass . He went past the bookshops on Fourth Avenue , browsing here and there . It was cold ; he would go home . He was entering the building when the door of the apartment of Langley Herndon opened . Cross saw a white face watching him from behind thick spectacles . He shut the door to the street , taking his time , then turned and started up the stairs . " Hey , you ! Wait a minute ! " It was the voice of a man who was used to issuing orders . Cross paused , turned his head , and registered a look of make-believe surprise . " What do you want here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean ? " Cross countered . " I 'm going up to my room . " " Your room ? Are you living here ? " Herndon demanded . " Of course . And who are you ? Why are you asking me all this ? " " I just happen to own this goddamn building , that 's all , " Herndonsaid with rough irony . " I say who can and ca n't live here ! " " But I 'm not going into your apartment , " he pretended to misunderstand . " I live upstairs  --  " " I do n't give a good goddamn where you live ! " Herndon snapped . " You ca n't stay in this building  --  " " Now , wait a minute ! I 've signed a lease with Mr. Blount  --  " " You ca n't talk to me that way ! " Herndon advanced and Cross doubled his fist . " Watch out ! You 're old and I do n't want to hurt you ! " He saw Herndon pause and blink his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . But do n't touch me , see ? " Herndon was short , gray , flabby , with a wide mouth . His eyes were inflamed and teary at the corners . His hair was black and slicked flat to the crown of a large , partly bald skull . He was violentlyagitated and seemed not to know what move to make . his face grew brick red . " How long have you been in this building ? " Herndon asked finally . " For almost a week , " Cross lied . Herndon looked him over , his eyes traveling from Cross 's necktie to his shoes .   " Say , come in here , " Herndon said suddenly . " I want to talk to you . " Cross thought , he 's going to try to scare me in another way now . . He stepped into a nicely furnished room which had a large desk . A wood fire burned in the grate and shadows danced along the walls . Herndon studied Cross for some seconds . " Listen , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stooping to give advice to someone who he doubted had sense enough to profit by it . " You are being misled . For thirty years I 've bad a strict policy about renting , and nobody 's going to make me change it . This lease you 're talking about  --  it 's nothing . Forget it . The quicker , the better for you . I 'm going to see Blount tonight and give ' im hell . Get me straight . I do n't give a good goddamn about what happens to you , see ? I could crush you , if I wanted to . Now , go upstairs and pack your stuff and get the hell out of there ! You 're black and you do n't belong here and you goddamn well know it . " " Thanks , " Cross said in a low , clear voice . " I 'm staying here as long as Mr. Blount says I can . It 's your move . " " So , you 're a Communist , hey ? " " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , and you think you 're being smart , " Herndon 's voice was rising . " I can take care of your kind . You Reds think " oll " I told you that I 'm not a Communist ; I 'm anti-Communist ! " Cross said sternly . " I do n't give a good goddamn what kind of a Communist you are ! " Herndon shouted . " I did n't think you did , " Cross said quietly . " That 's why I insisted on telling you . I 'm black and that 's what 's riling you . But I will not move from here . " Herndon , his lips quivering , yanked open a drawer of the desk . " Be careful , man , " Cross warned him , ramming his hand into his coat pocket . " I 'm armed . If you pull out a gun , I 'll shoot you ! " Cross was bent forward , his entire body tense , his eyes not blinking . Herndon slammed the drawer shut and came to the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black sonofabitch ! " he shouted , his body trembling with rage . " Get out of this house ! Get out of this building ! Get out of my sight ! If I see you again , I 'll kill you , you hear ? " P198Cross did not move ; he stood towering over Herndon , whose mouth held flecks of foam at the corners . " I 'm going , but I never turn my back on a man who 's yelling at me , " he said slowly . Herndon 's lips moved soundlessly . Cross kept his eyes on Herndonand walked backward to the door , still clutching his gun . With his left hand he groped for the knob , turned it , and pulled the door open . " Mr. Herndon , whenever you 're in my presence , be careful , " Cross said . " You 've threatened me and I wo n't forget it . " He went through the door and shut it . Things would happen fast now . He smiled as he went upstairs . The encounter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last shred of dreaminess leave him . This thing 'll be decided tonight one way or the other , he told himself as he entered the apartment . Eva returned an hour later . He had to be careful in her presence ; he must not let her feel that he had spied on her intimate life . " Oh , Lionel ! " she called . He went into the hallway and saw Eva still wearing her coat ; her cheeks were red and excitement was in her eyes . " Yes ? " " Herndon says he wants to see Gil as soon as he comes in , " Eva said breathlessly . " What happened ? Did you have a run-in with ' im ? " " We had it , " Cross said . " Did it get rough ? " " He wanted to pull a gun , but I told him I had one , too . " " Oh , Lord  --  " She leaned weakly against the wall . " Poor Lionel . . . " Her eyes were full of pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a victim of the Party , that the Party was using him for bait . I 'm tougher than you think , he said to himself . " It 's nothing , " he said . " I like his kind . " " Oh dear ! Where 's Gil ? " She was trembling . " Now , Eva , do n't worry , " Cross tried to soothe her . " Nothing 's going to happen for the moment , anyway . His next move will be to try to scare Gil , and I do n't think Gil scares easily . " " Do n't you want a drink or something ? " she asked , looking at him as though she expected to see him collapse . " I never refuse a drink , " he said . P199She brought out a bottle of cognac . " I brought this from France last summer , thinking I might need it sometime , " she said . " And now 's the time . " Cross looked at her and smiled . Bless her ; she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ... . " Look , " he said , pushing the glass she had filled to her . " I think you need this more than I do . " She drank from the glass and poured one for him . " What do you think will happen , Lionel ? " she asked in a whisper . " That Herndon 's capable of anything  --  Oh , God , Lionel , do you think it 's worth it ? " Cross could see that she was on the verge of telling him to ditch the Party , to get out , to save himself . At that moment he heard Gil 's key turning in the lock of the door and a pall of anxiety came over Eva 's face . Cross could see Gil hanging up his coat in the hallway . As Gil entered , Eva turned as though to speak to Cross , but checked herself . " Hello , everybody , " Gil said placidly . " Tired , Gil ? " Eva asked ; she was trying to act natural . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wallet from his coat pocket and extracted a paper from it , saying : " Here 's the permit for your gun , Lionel . The Party had a lawyer pull some strings ... . But be careful , guy . " " Thanks , " Cross said . " I might really need the permit . I met Herndon today . " " Really ? And how was it ? " " Rugged . " Eva rushed forward and caught hold of the lapels of Gil 's coat . " You must n't let Lionel get into this , " she said hysterically . " Herndon said he wanted to see you the moment you came in .... And he 's already threatened Lionel with a gun  --  " " Let Lionel tell me what happened , " Gil said , gently pushing Eva to one side , struggling to master his annoyance . " Well , " Cross began , " I was returning from  --  " " Just a moment , " Gil said . He took out his pipe and began to fill It with tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eva stared ; she seemed on the verge of speaking , but controlled herself . " I must see about dinner , " she mumbled , flushing red . She left the room and Gil lit his pipe , sucked at it .   " I 'm listening , " he said . Cross related what had happened , leaving out nothing . Gil made w no comment ; he rose and stood at a window looking out , smoking silently . Then he turned , sat at his desk and began writing . Eva came on tiptoe to the door , peered in apprehensively , then left . Cross lit a cigarette and waited . I 'll make him guess at what I 'm feeling just as I have to guess at what he 's feeling , he told himself . The doorbell pealed . Gil paused in his writing , lifted his hand from the page , then began writing again . Eva came to the door , her eyes round with fear . " Gil , " she called timidly . " Yes , " Gil answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's Herndon  --  Shall I answer ? " she asked in a whisper . " You 're always to answer the door , " he said calmly . As though seeking support , Eva looked at Cross . " If it 's Herndon , do be careful , " she said . " Eva ! " Gil barked at her . " I 'll answer it , " Cross said . " No , Lionel . Eva will answer the door , " Gil said in slow , heavy accents of authority . Cross wanted to rise and take the man by the throat . Why does he act like that ? Then he tried to dismiss it from his mind . After all , I 'm no angel , it 's really none of my business . . . . He was now sorry that he had read Eva 's diary ; his knowing her as he did made it impossible for him to regard her with detachment . Eva lingered a moment longer at the door , then vanished . " Ohl " Eva 's frightened voice came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Eva  --  Did I scare you ? Is Gil home ? I got to see ' im quick  --  It 's awfully important  --  " " Come in , Bob  --  But what 's the matter ? You look sick  --  Did you have some trouble downstairs ? " " Trouble ? Yes . But not downstairs . . . What do you mean ? Is Gil here ? " " He 's in the living room , " Eva said . Gil had stopped writing , his pen poised over the sheet of paper . His eyes hardened as Bob , his face twitching , his eyes bloodshot and staring , appeared in the doorway . " Hey , Lane , " Bob called to Cross ; there was no heartiness in his voice . P201Gil whirled in his seat and demanded : " What do you want here , Bob ? " Bob acted as if he had not heard ; he sank weakly into a chair . He looked at Gil and forced a sick grin that faded quickly and his facewent lifeless , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A large drop of mucus formed at the tip of his flat , brown nose , hovered there for a second , then dropped to his upper lip . He licked at it , unaware that he did so . " Gil , " he begged , " you 've got to help me . " Eva stood in the doorway . Cross sat watching . Gil was looking at Bob with half-turned body . Bob turned to Cross . " Lane , you got to talk to ' im for me  --  " " Bob ! " Gil shouted , his tone full of warning . " Lane has nothing to do with this , and you damn well know it ! What are you trying to do ? Disturb his faith in the Party ? You 've said enough already to be brought up on serious charges ! " " I just want to talk to ' im  --  " " You 're trying to influence Lane ! " Gil shouted again , leaping to his feet . " You 're organizing against the Party right here in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're trying to turn Lane against the Party right under my eyes ! " " Oh , God , no ! " " You are guilty right now of ideological factionalism ! " " What 's that ? " Bob asked incredulously . " You are trying to get Lane to support your ideas , " Gil accused . Bob sighed ; he had come to plead innocent to one crime and now he found himself accused of still another crime . Cross felt certain that Gil did not want him to witness this . " I 'll go to my room , " he offered . " No ; stay right here , " Gil ordered . And Cross suddenly realized that Gil wanted him to see what was happening . Gil 's chastisement of Bob could either be a warning or an object lesson . How efficient this is , Cross marveled . Not a single word or gesture is wasted . By observing this , Cross , too , could learn how to break and ravage the spirits of others , or he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained in the doorway , her eyes fixed upon Bob 's face . Gil was looking at her with eyes full of warning , but she was n't aware of his gaze . Then , the moment she saw it , she blushed and hurriedly left the room .   " Now , what 's the matter with you , Bob ? " Gil asked at last . Bob had not taken off his hat or his coat . Dirty snow melted on his shoes and tiny rings of water were forming on the carpet . Bob spoke in a broken whimper : " The Party voted to expel me , Gil  --  " " I know that , " Gil said calmly . " But Gil , I do n't wan na leave the Party  --  You got to help me  --  My life 's in the Party  --  The Party 's all I got in the world  --  I made a mistake  --  " " Tell that to the Party , " Gil said , turning and sitting again at his desk . " Oh , please , Gil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to say it , man  --  You know my problem  --  I 'm British  --  Only the Party knows it ! " Bob rose and went to the back of Gil and whispered despairingly : " Listen , an hour ago the Immigration men came to my flat , see ? Lucky , I did n't go to the door  --  Sarah went . She told ' em in a loud voice that I was out  --  I heard ' em talking to Sarah and I slipped down the back stairs  --  I came here , to you , Gil  --  You 're my friend  --  Gil , for God 's sake , do n't let ' em do this ; do n't let the Party do this to me  --  " " How do you know it was the Party ? " Gil asked . " But only the Party knew ! " " But how do you know the Party did it ? " Gil demanded . " Listen , I once heard I-Iilton threaten another West Indian Negro like me  --  He said he could drop an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behave  --  " " But have you any proof that the Party told the Government ? " Gil demanded . Bob shook his head ; his eyes were blank and empty . Cross saw the point ; if Bob had no proof , what harm could Bob 's accusation do ? " Naw ; I ai n't got no proof .... " Gil rose and stood over Bob . " Are you accusing the Party of playing the role of stool pigeon ? " he thundered . Bob winced as though he had been slapped . " No ! " " Then what in hell are you saying ? " " Gil , listen to me . Ten years ago I had to run off from Trinidad to keep the British from putting me in jail for Party activity  --  If IP203go back , they 'll snatch me off the boat and take me straight to jail for ten years  --  Ten years in jail in the tropics is death  --  I mean death , man  --  do n't you understand ? " " I understand , " Gil said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fought the Party . " " I did n't know I was fighting the Party .... I do n't want to fight the Party .... " " You took a position against the Party . . . . That 's counter-revolution . And for counter-revolutionists the Party has no mercy , " Gil told him . " Gil , you got to tell ' em to give me another chance . . . . The Party can hide me . . . . Let me go to Mexico , anywhere  --  " " Who are you to defy the Party ? " " I ai n't nobody , nothing .... " Bob slid from his chair and lay prone on the floor . " This is too much , Gil  --  Please , please , do n't let ' em do this to me . I was wrong . I confess . And I 'll do anything you say , Gil ! You 're on the Central Committee and they 'll listen to you . I been to headquarters and they wo n't even talk to me  --  " Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot on Bob 's neck and cut off the flow of whining words . Gil watched Bob with calm , placid eyes and Cross wondered how many men and women Gil had seen in that prostrate position of penitent surrender so that he could stare at Bob with so aloof and yet engrossed a passion . " Did you meet anybody when you came up here ? " Gil asked suddenly . Bob blinked his eyes bewilderedly . " Meet anybody ? No ; I did n't see anybody . . . . Gil , please ! " " All right , Bob . You can go now . " Bob sat up ; his hand went to his mouth in dismay . " Where ? " " I do n't care where you go  --  " " But they 'll get me , Gil ! Look , I 'll give my life to the Party ! " " The Party does n't want your life . " Gil smiled . Cross closed his eyes . He hated Bob for his weakness . No wonder Gil would n't give in ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eva came to the door , her eyes avoiding Bob . Cross could see her legs trembling . " Gil , dinner 's ready . " " Co ahead and eat , Lionel . I 'll join you later , " Gil said . P204Cross rose and went out of the room , his eyes avoiding Bob , who sobbed on the floor . He had no appetite , but he sat at the table and Eva served him . As he chewed his food , he heard Gil 's voice rising in accusation , then Bob 's voice falling in meek pleas . Then came a pause during which Bob coughed loudly . Finally there was a sound of footsteps in the hallway . Gil was saying something to Bob at the door , then the door closed . Cross looked at Eva ; her eyes were full of fear , and her hand shook slightly as she ate . Gil came briskly to the table , sat , keeping his eyes in front of him . He volunteered no information and acted as though he knew no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm hungry , " Gil said pleasantly and reached for the platter of roast beef . After he had served himself generously , Gil turned to Cross and asked : " Say , did you see who won the chess tournament in Moscow ? I was too busy to buy a paper . " " No , I do n't know who won , " Cross said , slightly nonplused . " Do you play chess ? " Gil asked . " No . " " You ought to learn . It 's wonderful for relaxation , " Gil advised him . As dinner proceeded in silence , Cross was aware that a feeling of tranquillity had descended upon him . In his mind Gil had receded far off until he had become a tiny , little luminous figure upon which all of his attention was focused . It was as if he were squinting his eye along the barrel of a rifle toward some distant and elusive target and at long last the center of the target had come within the hairlineof the sight . After he had drained his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What time is it ? " He looked at his wrist watch . " Hummm ... Ten past nine  --  I 'd better get down and see Herr Herndon . " " Do you want me to come with you ? " Cross asked . " Why ? " Gil asked , lifting his brows in surprise . Cross said nothing . Eva sat stiffly , staring with protesting eyes into her empty coffee cup . Then she lifted her eyes to Gil and Cross saw the light of protest die . God , she 's scared , Cross thought . If she 's that afraid of him , how she must hate him ! Gil stood and went into the hallway , then out the door . Eva rose suddenly , as though she had to drown her anxieties in activity , and began clearing the dishes from the table.  | " I 'll help you , " Cross said , taking a stack of plates and starting for the kitchen . " No , Lionel  --  " " Why not ? " he said . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want to , " he said . He wanted to be near her . Then they both were still . They heard loud voices coming from downstairs . Cross could distinguish Gil 's voice , then I-lerndon 's . They were at it strongly . The dishes slid from Eva 's hands to the table with a clatter , then she clutched the back of the chair till her knuckles showed white . " Do you think I ought to go down ? " he asked Eva . She shook her head . " No . If he said no , then do n't . He 'd be awfully angry , and when he 's angry he does n't speak for weeks  --  " She caught herself ; she had said more than she had intended . " Lionel , really , do n't bother with the dishes . Do what you like .... " Irritation was in her voice . He knew that he was making her more nervous ; she did n't want him to see her state of mind . " Okay . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put his ear to the floor and heard shouts full of hot anger , but no words were distinguishable . He lay on his bed , then jerked upright ; he heard a sharp snapping like wood breaking , then a dull thump , and all was silent . The door of his room flew open and Eva stood there , clasping her hands in front of her , staring at him with eyes filled with terror . " What was that ? " Cross went to her ; she clutched his hands tightly . " Do n't you think I ought to go down ? " he asked . " Yes , " she agreed impulsively . Then her body flinched and she shut her eyes in desperation . " No ; no ; he 'd be angry . He 'd think that you thought he could n't handle it  --  " Tears leaped into her eyes and she turned from him . " If he gets hurt , he 'll wonder why we did n't do something . He 'll think I did it on purpose  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was fighting against a wish for something to happen to Gil ; she was longing for someone to put him out of her life .. . A hoarse scream came from downstairs . " I 'm going down , " Cross said suddenly . " Yes , Lionel , " Eva breathed ; she was pale , trembling . P206He went quickly into the hallway . He realized as he went down the steps that he was acting more as a kind of proxy for Eva 's feelingsthan his own . I really do n't care , he thought . When he reached the landing of the first floor , he paused , listening to the sound of grunts , scuffling feet , and the thud of blows . He crept on tiptoe to the door . . . Was it locked ? He turned the knob ; the door swung in and Cross looked at the two men grappling with each other . Gil lashed out with his right fist , bashing Herndon on the ear and sendinghim reeling backward . Herndon collided with a table and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his right hand . Cross looked quickly at Gil and saw that his face was covered with bloody streaks where the fire poker had ripped into his flesh . Both men were oblivious of Cross , who stood in the doorway with a bitter smile on his face . Cross could barely contain himself as he watched the battle . Which man did he hate more ? Many times duringthe past hours he had wished both of them dead and now he was watching them batter each other 's brains out ... . He spun round at the sound of footsteps behind him on the stairs . Eva was descending with wild eyes , her hair flying behind her . He grabbed her shoulders and held her , wanting to keep her out of the room . Eva twisted loose and ran to the doorway . Cross followed and stood behind her . Eva grabbed hold of both jambs of the door and screamed as she saw Gil sinking to the floor under the blows of Herndon 's fire poker . Herndon turned and stared at Eva , still clutching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of a man struggling to awaken from a dream . Then Cross saw the muscles of Herndon 's face twitch as he advanced menacingly toward them . " Get out , or I 'll kill you both ! " Herndon growled . Eva screamed again , backed violently into Cross , then turned and ran up the stairs . Before Cross could move , Herndon was upon him and he ducked in time to save his head from a blow from the poker , which caught him on his right shoulder , leaving a searing line of fire in his flesh . He leaped aside and watched Herndon stumble toward the rear of the hall . Cross felt for his gun , then decided to run  --  not through fear of Herndon but because he hoped Herndon would re-enter the room and battle again with Gil .... He took the stairs four at a time , then , halfway up , he heard another scuffling lunge behind him ; he glanced back . Gil had rushed out of the room and hadP207grabbed Herndon ; the two men now wrestled for possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Cross 's sight as they fell through the doorway back into the room . Cross caressed his bruised shoulder and looked upward ; the door of Gil 's apartment was open and he heard Eva 's frantic voice . " Do n't you understand ? I want the police ! For God 's sake  --  " Cross entered the hallway . Eva thrust the telephone into his hands . " Lionel , here ; call the police . . . . I ca n't make the operator understandanything . " " Okay , " he breathed . " Are you hurt ? " " Not much . . . " He picked up the telephone , jiggled the hook , then paused , turning his head as another burst of sound came from downstairs . Eva sprang through the doorway , heading downstairs . " Eva ! " He left the phone and ran after her , catching her on the landing and dragging her back into the apartment . " No , no , " he told her . " You ca n't go down there .... You call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " she cried . " I 'll go down and help Gil , " he said . Eva stared at him helplessly . He thrust the telephone into her hands and ran from the room , stumbling down the stairs . In the lower hallway , he stood , hearing the sound of the fight . He debated : yes ; he had to help Gil .... What would Gil say if he did n't ? His failure to help would be something he could never explain ... . Again he stood in the doorway of Herndon 's apartment . Herndon was rushing at Gil , the poker raised to strike . Gil backed off , his hands lifted to protect his face and head . Herndon crashed the poker into Gil 's hands , which seemed to wilt under the blow . The poker flew from Herndon 's fingers and clattered to the floor . Gil snatched it up quickly and charged into Herndon , his face livid with fury ; he whacked Herndon 's head and face and Cross heard the tinkling of glass shards as Herndon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched , disdainful , detached . He saw a broken table leg lying near the fireplace ; one of them had no doubt crashed into the table and the heavy oaken leg had snapped in two near the top . Teeth bared , Gil lifted the poker again to smash Herndon ; but , P208as his arm was about to descend , the tip of the poker caught in the glass chandelier swinging from the ceiling . There was a musical storm of falling crystal and the ceiling light went out , leaving the room lit only by the leaping shadows of the fire . The force that Gil had put behind that swooping blow now carried him headlong to the floor , the poker bounding free . Catlike , Herndon was on it and before Gil could rise Herndon was covering him with deadly blows . Suddenly Cross knew what he wanted to do . He was acting before he knew it He reached down and seized hold of the heavy oaken leg of the table and lifted it high in the air , feeling the solid weight of the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely into the bloody forehead of Herndon . The impact of the blow sent a tremor along the muscles of his arm . Herndon fell like an ox and lay still . He had crushed the man 's skull . Tense , he stood looking down at Herndon , waiting to see if he would move again . He was concentrated , aware of nothing but Herndon 's still , bloody form . Then he was startled ; he whirled to see Gil struggling heavily to his feet , blood streaming from his face and neck , clotting his eyes . Cross stared for a moment . He was not through . The imperious feeling that had impelled him to action was not fulfilled . His eyes were unblinkingly on Gil 's face . Yes , this other insect had to be crushed , blotted out of existence ... . His fingers gradually tightened about the oaken table leg ; his arm lifted slowly into the air . Gil was dabbing clumsily with his handkerchief at the blood on his neck and cheeks . Cross let go with the table leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Gil trembled for a split second , then fell headlong toward the fireplace , where flames danced and cast wild red shadows over the walls . Cross 's hand sank slowly to his side , the table leg resting lightly on the floor , its edges stained with blood . There was silence save for the slow ticking of an ornate clock on the desk . He filled his lungs and sighed deeply . For perhaps a minute 1w did not move ; his senses gradually assumed a tone of anxiety and he stared more intently at the two bloody forms stretched grotesquely on the smeared rug . Then he sucked in his breath and whirled toward the door . Oh , God , it was still open ! Had anyone seen him ? He rushed to it and closed it ; then turned back to the room and the two inert forms . Were they dead ? He touched Herndon 's shoulder ; P209the man was still ; the wide , thin lips hung open ; blood oozed from one corner of the mouth . Cross hesitated a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skull . The body rolled over from the force of the blow . Cross now turned to Gil , whose head lay near the fire . He caught hold of one of Gil 's legs and yanked the body from the fireplace into the center of the room where he could get a better chance to deliver another blow at the head . Again he lifted the table leg and whacked at Gil and he knew that Gil would never move again . The universe seemed to be rushing at him with all its totality . He was anchored once again in life , in the flow of things ; the world glowed with an intensity so sharp it made his body ache . He had had no plan when he had dealt those blows of death , but now he feared for himself , felt the need for a plan of defense . He knew exactly what he had done ; he had done it deliberately , even though Ile had not planned it . His mind had n't been blank when he had done it , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took one last quick look about the room . One of the drawers of Herndon 's desk was open and Cross could see the butt of Herndon'sgun half pulled out . He could almost reconstruct what had happened between the two men . Gil had no doubt grabbed Herndon just as Herndon had been about to seize the gun . And after that they had fought so desperately that neither of them had had a chance to get the gun , or they had forgotten it ... . The plan sprang full and ripe in his imagination , his body , his senses ; he took out his handkerchief and quickly wiped the table leg which he held in his hand , making sure that no trace of his fingerprints would remain . He went to Herndon , holding the table leg with the handkerchief so that his hand would not touch it , and forced the fingers of Herndon 's right hand about it several times so that the man 's prints would be found . . . . He was breathing heavily . The winking shadows of the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the handkerchief , he went to Gil and closed Gil 's loose fingers about it . He took the fire poker , wiped it clean and inserted it in the fingers of Herndon 's right hand . . . . No ; he changed his mind ; he 'd let the fire poker rest a few inches from Herndon 's hand . That was more natural . . . . I le looked swiftly around to make sure that he was leaving no marks of his having been in the room . He had to hurry . . . . The door ? P210Fingerprints on the knob . . . ? No ; he would not bother about them . After all , if he made things too clean , the police would get suspicious .... And he had been down here talking to Herndon earlier this afternoon . . . . Sure . . . His prints had a right to be on the door . Go up to Eva . . . . What would he tell her ? There would be questions from the police , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers . . . ? What would they say ? Well , he was just a Negro roomer who had gone down at the suggestion of Mrs. Blount to see what was happening and had seen them fighting .... He opened the door ; the downstairs hallway was empty . He caught hold of the door handle and was about to shut it when an idea came to him . Suppose someone came to see Herndon and found both Herndon and Gil dead ? Ah , yes ; it was better to push the tiny lever on the lock and let the door lock itself . The door would be locked when the police and the Party leaders arrived . That was the trick . They would have to knock down the door . Andhe , on his second trip down , had not been able to see what was happening ; he had only heard sounds . . . . He adjusted the lockand pulled the door to , hearing it catch . He tried the handle ; it was locked . Now , what motive on earth could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure that out ... . He started up the stairs , then paused and looked down at himself . Was there any blood on him ? He looked at his hands , his coat , his shoes . He could see nothing . Oh , yes ; his handkerchief ; it was bloody from where he had wiped the fingerprints from the fire poker and the table leg .... He would have to burn it . Yes ; he 'd put it into the kitchen incinerator the first chance he got . And , to be absolutely sure , he would ditch the clothes he was wearing . The police had scientific ways of examining particles and arriving at damaging conclusions . He stood in front of Gil 's apartment door and composed himself . Yes ; he had to act hurriedly and frantically now . He grabbed hold of the door knob and rattled it brutally . It was locked . " Eva ! " he yelled . " Is that you , Lionel ? Is Gil with you ? " " It 's me ; Lionel ! Open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she had locked herself in . She opened the door and backed fearfully away from him . " Did you call the police ? " he asked her .   " No . I called Jack Hilton ; he 's calling the police  --  What hap-pened ? " He searched her face ; her eyes were bleak and frightened . Would she be glad that Gil was dead ? Did n't she want him dead so that she could be free ? " The door down there is locked and I ca n't hear a thing , " he told her . " Gil 's still in there .... " " Oh , God , " she whimpered . He longed to know what was going on in her mind . Was she hoping that Gil was dead ? And was she feeling guilty because she was hoping it ? If so , then she 'd act violently now ; she 'd try to ease her burden of guilt . " The door 's locked ? " she repeated in a quiet voice . " Yes . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilton again and tell him  --  He thinks maybe Gies all right now  --  " Her voice died in her throat and she had spun around and was out of the door before Cross could grab her . He debated : he had a wound on his shoulder to prove that he had tried to help Gil and maybe it would be a good thing for Eva to see that the door was locked . Then , Eva , panting and whimpering , came rushing in again . " He 's there ! " she gasped . " He 's coming up here .... " " Who ? " " Herndon  --  I saw ' im on the stairs  --  He has his gun  --  " Was she crazy ? Herndon was dead . Eva ran past him into her bedroom . Cross approached the door and looked out ; he heard footsteps mounting the stairs to the floor above him . Ah , Eva had thought she had seen Herndon , but she had mistaken another man for Herndon . . . . He shut the door and put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be used in his favor . Eva had thought that he had seen Herndon coming up the stairs ! That meant that her testimony would indicate that Herndon was still living after he had come up to the apartment for the second time . ... That could mean that Gil and Herndon killed each other ! By God , that was the plan ! He would stick to that story ... . " Eva ! " he called to her . " Give me Hilton 's phone number ! " When she did not answer , he went to her . She was lying on the floor of her bedroom ; she had fainted . He lifted her to her bed , gotP212a wet towel from the bathroom and patted her face with it . Her eyelids fluttered . " Give me Hilton 's phone number , " he insisted . " My purse , " she murmured . He got her purse and she gave him an address book and whispered : " Find the number there , under H .... " Cross found the number , then walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire situation and every muscle of his body was relaxed . Now , I 'd like to see them figure that out , he told himself with a grim smile . I killed two little gods . ... He paused , frowning . But they would have killed me too if they had found me like that . . . . Yet he could not get it straight . Just a moment ago it had all seemed so simple . But now it was knotted and complicated . There was in him no regret for what he had done ; no , none at all . But how could he have done it ? He too had acted like a little god . He had stood amidst those red and flickering shadows , tense and consumed with cold rage , and had judged them and had found them guilty of insulting his sense of life and had carried out a sentence of death upon them . As Hilton and Gil had acted toward Bob , so had he acted toward Gil and Herndon ; he had assumed the role of policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one swift and terrible moment . But , if he resentedtheir being little gods , how could he do the same ? His self-assurance ebbed , his pride waned under the impact of his own reflections . Oh , Christ , their disease had reached out and claimed him too . He had been subverted by the contagion of the lawless ; he had been defeated by that which he had sought to destroy . He sank listlessly into the chair by the side of the telephone . Yet , no matter what happened , he had to call Hilton ; he had to phone that little god . . . ! He was limp . What was the matter with him ? He was , yes , he was trapped in the coils of his own actions . He had acted , had shattered the dream that surrounded him , and now the world , including himself in it , had turned mockingly into a concrete , waking nightmare from which he could see no way of escaping . He had become what he had tried to destroy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slain . Held to a point of attention more by the logic of events than by his own reasoning , charged with a sense of meaninglessness , he bent toward the telephone and dialed . . . . P213Book Four : DespairThe wine of life is drawn ; and the mere leesIs left this vault to brag of.  --  SHAKESPEARE 'S MacbethIN TALKING to Hilton over the telephone , Cross was careful to assume the role of a subordinate , a humble outsider , a man speaking for a temporarily incapacitated woman . " But Eva phoned and told me that you 'd gone down to help Gil , " Hilton said in a baffled tone of voice . " But the door was locked this time  --  " " Did you try to get in ? " " Yeah . I banged and knocked and hollered  --  " " And Herndon did n't answer ? " " No . " And did you hear anything ? " " Fighting , like I told you  --  " " Did you try to get help from anywhere ? " " Eva called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , he hit you ? " " Yes , with the fire poker  --  " " Where 's Eva now ? " " She fainted . She 's lying down . " " You hear any noise now ? " " Nothing ; nothing at all . " " And Herndon ran Eva back into the apartment , hunh ? " " Yes ; I was trying to phone you and she ran out  --  " " He had a gun ? "   " She said so . I did n't see him . I bolted the door when she came running back in . " " Did Gil seem badly hurt ? " " Gosh , I do n't know . I only got a glimpse of ' im , " Cross was purposefully vague . " Look , you ought to come over and I could explain it all . I just moved in this morning , see ? This Herndon jumped me at sight , told me to get the hell out , wanted to pull a gun on me , said he 'd kill me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the door ? " " He was lying on the floor . " " Herndon knocked him down ? " " Seems like it . Herndon had the fire poker in his hand  --  " " Did you see him strike Gil ? " " Yes . " " Was Gil conscious ? " " I do n't know  --  " " And you 're sure that Eva saw him on the stairs a few minutes ago ? " " Sure ; she said so . " " Okay . Now , listen , do n't let anybody into the apartment until I come , unless it 's the police or somebody from the Party , see ? " " All right . " " That 's all . I 'll be right over . " The line clicked . Not once had any emotion entered Hilton 's voice as he questioned Cross over the telephone , but Cross noticed throughout Hilton 's inquiries a theme that puzzled him . Then he had it . Hilton was already trying to establish the fact that Herndon was the aggressor . Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own defense could be best served by his feeding the Party 's hunger for a martyred hero , dead or alive . He marveled at how instinctively Hilton was reacting in terms of the Party 's organizational needs . If , in describingwhat he had seen when he had looked into the doorway , he said that Gil had seemed to be getting the worst of it , that Herndon had been standing over Gil with the fire poker , then the Park ' would claim , when it found that Gil was dead , that Herndon , the Fascist beast , had killed him , and had later died of wounds which Gil , in self-defense , had inflicted on him during the course of the struggle . And then there was that fantastic luck of Eva 's thinkini ; that she had seen Herndon after Herndon had been killed and afterP215the door had been locked ! Cross knew that he had to be careful in relating what he had seen , had always to keep sternly in mind that he must do no interpreting at all , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place their own assessment on it . His aim would be to establish in the minds of the police and Party leaders that Herndon had been alive when he had last looked into the room , that Gil had been hurt , unconscious , maybe dying , and ; liter that the door had been locked .. . And would n't Eva be his unconscious ally ? He was convinced that her actions had been determined by an awful sense of guilt toward Gil . The fantasy of seeing Herndon with a gun on the stairs sprang from her guilt  --  Herndon ought to kill her now that he had done her secret bidding by killing Gil .... And Eva no doubt felt that Cross was , like her , a victim of the Party 's complicated duplicities . ... Yes , he had a chance to stand clear of suspicion as long as he could manipulate or count upon the guilt feelings of others . Cross took a deep breath and tried to keep the facts straight in his mind . This thing had come upon him so suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had he killed them or was it a teasing fantasy ? They both must be dead , or his whole plan was crazy . Or , if Gil lived , he was in deadly trouble , both with the ! police and the Party . He longed to creep downstairs and make sure that they were both dead . But they must be dead . God knows he had crushed them hard enough . Gil would have to be a superman to live after the slashes from Herndon and the heavy whacks from the table leg . Of Herndon he could be certain ; that Fascist was dead .... " Lionel . . . " Eva 's voice was calling . " Yes ? " He went to her ; she was leaning on her elbow in bed and she ooked at him with eyes full of fear and guilt . " Did Gil seem badly hurt ? " " I do n't know , " he answered her softly . " What did Hilton say ? " " He said for us to stay here ; he 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Party . " " But we should try to do something for Gil  --  " " The door 's locked , Eva  --  "   " Oh , God , " she cried , " I wish Hilton 'd come . Do you hear anythingdown there now ? " " No , " Cross said . " I was listening in the front hall , but I could n't hear anything . " She broke down again and began weeping . " I ca n't stand this life  --  this deception  --  this everlasting violence  --  Is n't there any way to be human any more ? " Before he could stop her , she had sprung from the bed and was running on swift feet down the hall to the door . " Gil ! Gil ! " she was screaming . " Eva ! " he yelled and started after her . " He 'll blame me if we do n't help him , " she sobbed hysterically . " And the Party 'll want to know why we did n't help him .... " She sobered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to explain something that he could not possibly understand . Yes ; she , like him , was wondering if Gil was really dead . A wounded Gil , a living Gil , would be a calamity for both of them . He longed to put her at peace , to tell her that she was free . But he could not . He caught her on the landing , about to descend the stairs . He grabbed her shoulders . " The door 's locked ! " he insisted . Yes , he would stress that she must be loyal to the Party , something which she feared more than she feared Gil . " The Party will make a test case of this , see ? We ca n't interfere ... . " A better idea leaped into his mind ; she felt that he was a victim of the Party and he would try to exploit her delusion . That 's it .... " Look , Eva , " he argued solemnly , " this is complicated . The reason that Hilton does n't want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You know the police . . . . They 'd tryto frame me .... " She wilted , turned , and buried her face on his shoulder . Hers was a world ruled by fear . He led her back into the apartment and bolted the door ; sweat stood on his forehead . He guided her steeps to the bed and gently helped her upon it . They were silent ; they heard footsteps in the hallway . Eva strained , lifting herself almost to a sitting position . Could that be the police or Hilton ? Cross heard the footsteps mount the stairway . No ; it was somebody who lived upstairs . " The Cushmans , " Eva whispered . " They 're anti-Party . " Cross stared at her in amazement . To her the world was either Party or anti-Party , and all in between did not count . He sat on  --  P217chair at the side of the bed . Eva was shaking . He longed to take hold of her and soothe her , but dared not . " You think they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked in a whisper . " We did what we could , " he told her . " This was not our idea , Eva . They should have sent someone to help Gil . . . . And hewould n't let me go down with him .... " Cross rose and Eva reached impulsively and grabbed his hand and clung to it . " Do n't go , " she begged . " I was going to try to listen at the door  --  " " Do n't leave me here , " she pleaded in a whisper of panic . He sat again on the edge of the bed and felt nervous tremors going through her body . If only he could tell her that she was free ! But , no . . . If he told her that he had killed , the horror she felt for the Party would be transferred to him ... . He was aware of her slim , willowy figure on the bed , the legs that tapered with such a long , slow curve , the suggestively dramatic roundness of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicateneck , and the hazel pools of her eyes now dark and anxious with dread ; and desire for desire rose in him for her for the first time . Oh , God , he must not think of that now . . . . He felt the soft pressure from her thin , almost transparent fingers on his hand and she became woman as body of woman for his senses . The depths of ! aim stirred as he realized that she was now alone in the world and ( lid not know it ; in a peculiar sense she was at his mercy . What he ( lid or did not do , what he said or did not say would affect her more profoundly now than anything that would ever happen to her . Alreadyshe was his in a deeper sense than the sexual , in a sense that included the sexual . At this moment she was again an orphan ; she had only him to depend upon and he could now , as Gil had done with Bob , ravage her entire being without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diary and from the fact that Gil was dead and she did not know it , he possessed a comprehension of her existence that she had not the capacity to imagine . Would she suspect him ? Could she suspect him ? She believed that colored people were caught up in life , healthy , untouched and unspoiled by the cynical world of political deceptions . . . . Had she not referred to " us " when she spoke of her fear of the Party ? For the first time since he had killed , he felt guilty . It was notP218a guilt for his having murdered ; it was because he now saw that he held over the life of Eva a godlike power and knowledge that even Gil or the Party had not held . He had killed Gil and Herndon because they had wanted to play god to others , and their brutal strivingshad struck him as being so utterly obscene that he had torn their lives from them in a moment of supreme conviction that he and he alone was right and that they were eternally wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trembling red shadowsand he sat here holding Eva 's hand , desiring her body . And the wall of deception which he had begun to erect to conceal the nature of her husband 's death would throw her , perhaps , into his arms ... . If the actions of Gil and Herndon were monstrously inhuman , then was n't what he was doing also devoid of humanity ? If there was a valid difference , just where did it lie ? Was the guilt of Gil and Herndon the less because they had millions of supporters , becausetime and tradition , law and religion had mounted a shield of justification before them ? And his guilt , was it the more because he was alone and had no counsel but his own ? If Gil or Herndon had done what he had done , would it have worried them ? Was n't his worrying proof that he was wrong ? Did n't he need about him the sanctioning buttress of the faces of his brothers in crime to make him feel at home with his deed ? His sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be free of this circling , brooding that filled his skull , this elusive shadow of himself that tortured him . To go on killing would only sink him deeper into the quicksands of guilt which he wanted so much to avoid . But what way was there out of this ? The desperately naive idea of confessing everything to Eva came to him . Might not she , being another victim , understand and help him ? No ! That was crazy .... She believed him an innocent victim , not a guilty one ! No ; he could talk to no one now ; he had to tread this guilty treadmillalone ... . He recovered himself as the fingers of Eva 's hand tightened about his own . " Are you frightened , Lionel ? " " No . " " What can we tell them ? " " The truth . We 'll tell them what happened .... " He knew that , childlike , she was already thinking that maybe aP219lie would be a better kind of truth to tell than to try to conceal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why was he mulling and hesitating ? Ride this thing out and take this lovely girl and live with her .. . " What are you thinking , Lionel ? " " Nothing , " he breathed . " They 'll say we acted wrongly , wo n't they ? " " How could they ? " he asked . " We could n't do any more than we did  --  " " Oh , why did the Party push you into this ? " she wailed . " We 're in it together , " he told her . The doorbell rang . Cross let in Jack Hilton and another man . They stared at one another for a moment in silence . Eva came running from the bedroom . " He 's still down there , Jack  --  Ca n't you do something ? " she implored . " Maybe he 's hurt . . . . " Hilton 's face turned pale and he spun to Cross . " But the police ? Are n't they here yet ? " " No , " Cross told him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And that door 's still locked ? " " I guess so , " Cross stammered . " My God  --  " Hilton said , whirling and going through the door . He halted , turned , and beckoned to his companion . " Come on , Menti ! " They thundered down the stairs . Eva followed Menti ; and Cross , lingering , followed Eva , watching Hilton 's movements , wondering what his tactics would be . They paused momentarily in the downstairshallway . Hilton advanced to the door of Herndon 's apartment . " Is this the door ? " " Yes , " Cross told him . Hilton grabbed the knob and rattled it . " Gil ! Are you there ? " Hilton called loudly . " Gil ! Gil ! " Eva yelled , hammering on the panels of the door with her fists . " You 'd better break it down , " Cross said . " I 've called and called  --  " P220Hilton hesitated , then ran to the rear door and tried the handle . He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder to it , Menti , " Hilton said . " Okay , " Menti agreed eagerly . Menti , tall , black-haired , with a nervous , too-white face , backed off to the bottom of the stairs , quickly hunched his shoulders and sent himself toward the door ; the second his body hit the panels , the door burst in , banging loudly against the wall inside . Menti blocked Cross 's vision and he could see nothing ; he remembered the room lit by flames and dancing shadows , but the wood fire had died down . Eva pushed past him , then stopped , her face gazing at the floor of Herndon 's study . " Gil ! Oh , God , Gil ! " she screamed . Cross could now see the dim outlines of Gil and Herndon lying outstretched on the rug . They were as he had left them , the table leg and the fire poker lying near their right hands , their faces darkenedwith splotches of blood . " Good Christ , " Menti breathed . " Gil ! Gil ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Hilton stood without moving , his thin lips hanging open . Eva was now bent over Gil , her hands reaching out as though to touch him ; then she closed her eyes and leaned weakly against a wall , sobbing . Cross watched closely , waiting for questions . Hilton was the first to master himself ; he rushed forward , knelt at Gil 's side and felt for his pulse . His eyes lifted to Eva 's face ; then he looked at Cross ; he stood slowly , turning and looking at Menti . Only later did he glance at Herndon , then kneel and feel for his pulse . " Help him , " Eva begged , staring at Gil as though she expected him to rise and accuse her . " We better call the police again , " Menti said . " Better call a doctor , " Cross ventured . " No ; wait , " Hilton said , his eyes straying from face to face . " Look , do n't touch anything here . . . . Let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged . " He 's bleeding . . . . Somebody do something .... " She knelt to touch Gil , but Hilton grabbed her arm . " Gil 's dead , Eva , " Hilton told her . " Do n't touch anything . " Cross held her by her shoulders , conscious that Hilton 's eyes were upon him . He knew that the time of his drastic test was beginning , P221a test he did not want , for , if he won it , what had he won ? Eva ? Fie had n't killed to get her . Hilton was still staring at him ; then Hilton turned and walked slowly to the hall door . Menti ran to Hilton and grabbed his arm . " Had n't I better call the Party again ? " he asked . " We have n't time , " Hilton said . " The police 'll be here any minute now . " Menti was nonplused ; " I think we should call the Party , " he said . " Take it easy , Menti , " Hilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more complicated than you think . I 'm in charge here . I spoke to Blimin over the phone and he told me to take complete responsibility . This is political . " " I see , " Menti said , dropping his eyes . Hilton was now staring at Cross . And Cross , as he watched Hilton , knew that this was the man he had to cope with , and a slow hatred for Hilton began to surge up in him . He still kept his arm about Eva , who was trembling against him . Why was Hilton staring at him so ? Was he already suspecting him ? Hilton was a member of the upper circles of the Party and he was no fool . Cross held himselfalert , every atom of him striving to be aware of what was taking place . " We 've no time to lose , " Hilton told them roughly . " Everybody get upstairs at once . Stay in the apartment until I come . " " No , no , " Eva sobbed . " Help Gil  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's too late . " Cross led Eva into the hallway and struggled up the steps with her ; Menti helped him , but kept looking over his shoulder to see what Hilton was doing . Inside the apartment , Eva clutched Menti and begged : " Ca n't something be done , Menti ? It 's not too late , is it ? " " Take it easy , Eva , " Menti said . " Hilton 's doing everything .... " Cross eased Eva upon the sofa of the living room and Menti sat next to her , holding her shoulders . Hilton entered a moment later and Cross could see sweat on his forehead . " He should 've broken that door down , " Menti told Hilton , nodding to Cross . " No ; he did right , " Hilton said . " He 's colored . . . . This thing is complicated .... "  |p222Hilton  left the room and Cross could bear him putting the night chain on the front door . Hilton returned and knelt at Eva 's side . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , " can you understand me ? Are you fit to be questioned ? We do n't have much time  --  " " But maybe he 's not dead , Jack , " Eva whimpered . " Try . . . Try to do something . . . . " " They 're both dead , Eva , " Hilton said sternly . " We 've no time for that . . . . You must get hold of yourself . You 're in the Party . You must rise above personal feeling . This is important to the memory of Gil and I must discuss it with you . You hear me ? " " Yes , " Eva breathed , trying to still the shaking of her body . " Gil 's been killed by a Fascist , " Hilton explained . " He was carryingout Party orders when he was killed ; he fell in line of duty .... That must be understood . This is a Party matter . The bourgeois press 'll try to twist those facts downstairs , and we must see that they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were with us now , would agree emphatically to that . " " Yes , " Eva said , nodding her head slowly ; she glanced at Cross and buried her face in her hands . Cross grasped the approach ; it was as he had hoped it would be . But they had not questioned him yet ; that was to come . " Now , Eva , " Hilton was saying , " tell me quickly what happened .... " " Ask Lionel . . . . I only saw Herndon beating Gil , " she said . " You were not in the room at all ? " Hilton asked Eva . " No .... Hilton rose and faced Cross . " Were you in the room ? " " No , " Cross said . " I was looking in through the door . He came at me , hit me with the poker  --  Right here  --  " " Start from the beginning and tell me quickly , " Hilton urged . Cross sketched the story briefly , telling the facts just as they had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " God , I 'm sorry about Gil , " he ended up . " This is war , " Hilton said . " We must expect casualties . Gil was brave . " He studied Cross . " I saw you at Bob 's last night , did n't I ? " " Yes . " " What 's your name ? "   " You 've got to help us with this thing , " Hilton said . " You were Gil 's friend .... " " I 'll do what I can . " " Listen to me carefully , all of you , " Hilton began . " The important thing here is who died first . Get it ? " " What do you mean ? " Menti asked . " If it 's proved that Herndon died first , then they 'll want to brand Gil as a murderer , " Hilton explained swiftly . " But Eva saw Herndon alive with a gun . . . . He was after her , " Cross told him . " Yes ; I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the door and saw Herndon beating Gil . . . Gil was not able to defend himself , was he ? Herndon was killing him . . . . Do you understand ? It 's important . " Menti approached Cross and caught his arm . " Look , guy , Gil was killed by that Fascist , " Menti said . " Do you understand that ? " " Gil died fighting for your people , for you , " Hilton reminded him . " I know that , " Cross said , simulating bafflement ; he did n't want to seem to grasp it too quickly . He squinted his eyes and looked at the floor ; he felt like laughing out loud . They were now begging him to believe something that he was praying that they would believe ! Cross looked at Eva . Though she had stopped sobbing , Cross could see that she did n't quite follow what was being said . Cross felt that now was the time to co-operate with the Party , to demonstrateclass consciousness , to cast his solidarity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Hilton to Menti . " When I looked through the doorway , I saw Herndon with his foot on Gil 's chest  --  He was hitting Gil  --  With the poker  --  I do n't know how many times he hit him  --  Then Eva came down and Herndonsaw us . He ran us back upstairs with the fire poker .... " " Yes , " Eva sighed . " And Gil could n't move when you looked into that door ? " Hilton demanded . " No , he was out , unconscious , it seems to me ... . Hilton turned to Eva . " And you saw Herndon after Lionel was up here ? He was comingP224to get into the apartment ? You ran back in and shut the door , did n't you , Eva ? He had his gun ? " " Yes , " she said . " That is proof , " Hilton said . Cross wondered if Eva really believed it . Her sense of guilt was making her paint a picture that was helping him . " Lionel , you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , " Hilton said . " Cops are your enemies . Look at what they 've done to your people . . . . Do n't forget the lynchings . . . . No matter what they do to you , say nothing but the truth ; you hear ? Gil gave his life for you . Herndon miscalculated ; he thought he could scare Gil . When Herndon killed Gil , he was really killing you ; you under-stand ? " " I understand , " Cross answered . " You better call those cops again , " Menti said . Hilton left and a moment later Cross heard him dialing the telephone . Menti stood looking at Cross and Eva , and Cross could guess what was going through the man 's mind . Menti was hoping that Eva would be able to keep him in line , keep him loyal to the Party ; and no doubt that same idea was in the back of Hilton 's mind . " Poor girl , " Menti said to Cross , nodding toward Eva . " We owe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can depend on me , " Cross assured him ; the corners of his mouth twitched , for he was wondering just what they would dependupon him for : to lie for the Party or to try to win Eva ? And , back of it all , he was protecting his own wild despair at having surrendered to his pride to the point of having killed ... . Hilton returned to the room absent-mindedly puffing at a cigarette . His bony , ascetic face was tensely concentrated . Cross marveled at the self-possession of this man who , twenty-four hours ago , had mercilessly reduced Bob 's enthusiasm for organizing to a heap of whimpering flesh , and Cross was certain that no regretful memories lingered on in Hilton 's mind as he coldly grappled with this new crisis . Men like Hilton did not spend their days scheming how to get hold of dollars ; they worked at organizing and exploiting the raw stuff of human emotions . In being close to the common impulses of men , in their cynical acceptance of the cupidities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were akin to priests . Now that he had killed Gil and had elected to remain near Eva , this man was his adversary , an adversary who played aP225game whose stakes held nothing less than life and death . . . . Cross fought feebly against an intellectual pride that was rising in him and making him want to cope with Hilton , to show him that he and his kind did not possess a monopoly of knowledge about the emotionalnature of man . And again Cross was dismayed at himself for contracting the ailment he hated . To fight Hilton meant fighting Hilton on Hilton 's own ground , just as he had had to kill Gil and Herndon on their own ground , and that in itself was a defeat , a travesty of the impulse that had first moved him . . . . Was all action doomed to this kind of degradation ? How did one get around that ? Or maybe you could n't get around it ? Perhaps he was staring right now at the focal point of history : if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total power you too had to use total power and in the end you became what you tried to defeat ... . Hilton was restless , shifting from foot to foot , as if he feared that if he stood still he would commit some violent act . Here was a human instrument that had placed the total capacities of its life completely at the disposal of the Party . . . . Cross could feel that Hilton , at this very moment , was pondering some question concerninghim , for Hilton 's wary eyes were fixed upon his face . Finally Hilton said to Cross : " Come into the kitchen a moment . " " Sure . " Monti was talking to Eva now in low , consoling tones and Cross followed Hilton . When they were inside the kitchen , Hilton shut the door . He smiled and asked : " How 's she taking it ? " " As you see , " Cross answered , on guard . " You think we ought to get somebody to be with her ? " " Gosh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Hilton had shown no concern about Eva 's state until now . " She does n't seem to show much of what 's going on in her . " " That 's what I 'm scared of , " Hilton said in a tone of amused wonder . " She might even be glad that Gil is dead when she 's over the shock . Gil was a first-class sonofabitch , if ever there was one . He was an absolutely cold fish whom I tried always to avoid , if I could .... " He caught hold of Cross 's arm and squeezed it . " You 're not so bourgeois that speaking the truth about the dead bothersyou ? " " Hell , no , " Cross said ; he was genuinely surprised . What was the man getting at ? " Gil was snobbish to the point of inciting murder , really , " HiltonP226went on , smiling wryly . " Frankly , I 've no sympathy for him . I 'm a Communist , and a dead man , so far as I 'm concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled uneasily . " He never liked me . I 'm just an ex-schoolteacher , but Gil 's father was a 1905er .... His real name was Bernstein . He grew up in the Bronx with the air of revolution in his home and it always made him feel that he was of the Red elite . He hit at me several times politically , but I dodged him . He was widely hated in the Party . " " I did n't know that , " Cross said . Why 's he telling me this ? " And Eva 's a cold one too , " he went on in a tone of voice that told Cross that he was now getting to his point . " There was no love lost between Gil and Eva .... Do n't kid yourself . In the Party , we know things . " Hilton looked at Cross curiously . He 's worried about Eva and he 's wondering how much I know .... He decided not to tell Hilton that he knew Eva 's marriage had been arranged by the Party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seething with hatred and despair . " She knows a lot about the Party , but Gil was her only real link to us , " Hilton pursued his theme . His lips moved without emitting words . " Have you heard her say anything against the Party ? " he asked finally . Cross decided at once that he would defend Eva : their interests were identical . " Never . " He reflected that he was a newcomer and his word would not mean much . " She 's never spoken an anti-Party word . In fact , I 've asked her about political issues , but she 'd never talk . Of course , you know that I 'm not yet a member of the Party .... " " She likes colored people , " Hilton said . He hastened to add : " I 'm not saying that in a nasty way . She does . Tell me , do you think she trusts you ? " Cross understood at last . Hilton was asking him to watch over Eva ! And he was longing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party 's sake . And , no doubt , in the living room Menti was hinting to Eva to keep an eye on Cross .. . " I do n't know , " Cross said cautiously . " From what I see of her reactions , I think she does , " Hilton said with a sly smile . Cross was angry , but he hid his feelings . He sensed that at
