The Love of Four Colonels ( by Peter Ustinov ) does something to brighten a dun-colored season , but not much to fur ther the dramatic art . The first play of London 's precocious , prolific Peter Ustinov to appear on Broadway , a play is precisely what Four Colonels can not be called . In essence it is a series of parodies set inside a framework of fantasy ; and like most jokes that last all evening , it would far better keep earlier hours . But Playwright Ustinov at his best is witty and at his next-best rather gay , and Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer are sometimes helpful where he is not . <P> The play introduces four army colonels - U.S. , British , French and Russian-in a disputed zone in postwar Germany . Seated round a table , they spar with one another while the playwright spoofs them all . But politics is only the appetizer ; the main course is sex . Enter now the good and bad angels of the four men , to conduct them to a neighboring castle where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to wake and win her with a kiss , and each may choose his own ideal time and place for the trial . Having kidded the colonels , Ustinov now kids their national drama . The Sleeping Beauty is wooed in vain in a French period comedy , an Elizabethan verse-play , a languid bit of Chekhov , a Hollywood melodrama . <P> These playlets let the two stars caper at will , with Rex Harrison providing some brilliant bits while Lilli Palmer exerts her lure in all wigs and weathers . If Ustinov 's talent wobbles , his tone remains fixed : as both satire and fantasy , the play is always fizz and never highfalutin.
