SHADOWS MOVE AMONG THEM ( 334 pp. ) - Edgar **26;8038;TOOLONG . <P> Mabel Harmston differed from other young women in that she was " freckled from throat to navel . " Her freckles ranged from " pinpoint dots " to " paw prints , " and her kid brother Berton and her younger sister Olivia , who often studied Mabel in the raw , believed that her markings constituted a magic code map . <P> Such childish notions brought a smile to the lips of the children 's father , the Rev. Gerald Harmston , of the Brethren of Christ the Man , as he strolled half-naked down the corridor of his British Guiana vicarage . The good parson loved his children , and though occasionally he cuffed Olivia or floored Berton with a sweep of his arm , he never thought it necessary to put them in chains or poison them-courses he felt obliged to take with his more difficult native parishioners . Discipline , he always said , is " the keynote of our lives . " But those who urged him to adopt the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ants ' nest-were always sharply rebuked . " Learn not to hate , " the parson would say . " Hate eats up the soul . " <P> The Harmston way of life greatly surprises young Gregory Hawke , who comes from Britain to stay with his clerical Uncle Gerald because his nerves have been shattered by war and his wife 's suicide . Gregory frets when the malaprop adolescent , Olivia , pries at him with personal questions ( " Was your wife a lymphomaniac ? " ) . He shudders at the steady plop-plop of scorpions , centipedes and hairy spiders falling like rain from rafters to floor ; he chafes when Ellen , the Indian housemaid , presses " limp against him , her skin roughened with a gooseflesh of ecstasy . " Uncle Gerald has to explain that " this environment , coupled with our religion , tends to stimulate our imaginations to unorthodox behavior . " <P> Before long , young Gregory is responding to religion and environment with promising gusto-scaring freckled Mabel out of her wits with an open razor , chuckling over messages scribbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " My flat chest burns for you " ) . He learns to agree with his reverend uncle in one of the credos of the Brethren of Christ the Man : " Life is quite pointless " and consequently must be conducted with " just enough reality to keep us fed , sheltered and tolerably entertained , and just not enough fantasy to have us certified insane . " Even the idea that fourth-offender criminals must be firmly liquidated strikes Gregory as almost sensible , and he quite sees the point when the parson 's wife remarks : " We 're making . . . people happy as human beings should be happy-that 's our consolation . And when we read Time and the Daily Mirror overseas edition . . . I can assure you , we get even more consolation . England ! Look what England has come to ! " <P> When Shadows Move Among Them was published in Britain this spring , the clearing of critical throats could be heard up &; down England . Consensus : like nothing else in current fiction .
