A plain , red brick clinic , called the " Jimmy Fund Building , " was opened at Children 's Hospital in Boston last week , and the first patients trooped in for examinations and checkups . All were boys &; girls for whom , until about five years ago , medical science could offer little or no comfort . They were victims of generalized cancers such as leukemia ( in the blood stream ) or the spreading type of Hodgkin 's disease ( in the lymph nodes ) . Now there is at least good reason for hoping that their lives can be made both brighter and longer . <P> The youngsters got their first boost in the waiting room . Thanks to the Variety Club of New England , one of the " angels " financing the new building , there was a layout of electric trains , a television set , a miniature merry-go-round , and a rack of dolls . If a little girl got attached to a doll , she could keep it ; there were more where it came from . Corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snow White . <P> Switch the Antagonists . Even in the examining and treatment rooms there were bowls of lollipops . But here , the serious business of fighting childhood cancer was under way . <P> Once , X rays were the doctors ' only weapon against these inoperable cancers and were effective in only a few types of cases . In the last five years , Boston 's Dr. Sidney Farber and a team of assistants have been getting encouraging results with new drugs . One of the first to show promise was nitrogen mustard ( a deadly poison developed in World War II for chemical warfare ) . Newer and better , Dr. Farber believes , are the awkwardly named " folk acid antagonists . " These , like ACTH and cortisone , are most often effective against the leukemias . <P> In most cases , one type of drug is effective for a while and then its benefit wears off . So the doctors switch to another . Later they may switch back again . This way , the life-prolonging properties of all the drugs seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the onset of acute leukemia . A boy has been kept going for 35 months ; despite a bad relapse last fall , he now goes to school and does figure skating . Under older methods of treatment , both would have been dead within a year . <P> Back on the Farm . " Jimmy , " for whom the clinic and research building was named , is a New England farm boy . When he first saw Dr. Farber , the diagnosis was dismal : lymph-node cancer . Previous results with nitrogen mustard had been spotty , so Jimmy got three ( out of the seven ) folic acid antagonists . Today he is back doing chores on the family farm and feeling fine . His cancer shows no sign of activity . <P> No one , least of all the cautious Dr. Farber , believes that a cure for these children 's cancers is in sight . Even now , one-third of all leukemia victims fail to respond to any treatment . But Dr. Farber believes that he and his colleagues are on the right track .
