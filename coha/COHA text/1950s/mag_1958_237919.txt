The Los Angeles County Museum is the West Coast 's largest , but until recently its shortcomings have given Los Angeles a reputation in the art world as the city of lost opportunities . Rich art collectors bypassed the museum in their bequests ; in 1951 the famed Arensberg collection of modern paintings was snatched from under its nose by the Philadelphia Museum . This week the Los Angeles County Museum had something worth crowing about . Up on the wall of its softly lighted Spanish Gallery went a handsome new acquisition with a resounding title and glamorous history : Portrait of La Marquesa de Santa Cruz as Euterpe , Muse of Lyric Poetry by Spain 's famed Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes ( see color page ) . For generations in the hands of the Dukes of Wellington , the Muse is also a handsome tribute to the scholarship , energy and tenacity of bustling 41-year-old Richard Fargo Brown , who in three years as head of the museum 's art division has brought it new vitality and stature . <P> Prime Catch . Goya 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years was also his least-known painting . He painted the young Marquesa about 1804 , when she was one of the leading lights of proud Spanish intellectual circles and a member of the group that welcomed the Duke of Wellington as a national hero when he arrived to drive out Napoleon 's troops . The victorious Wellington returned to London in 1814 , carrying hundreds of gifts showered upon him by the grateful Spanish . Among them was the Muse . For generations it hung almost forgotten in impressive Strat-field Saye House , the Wellington family seat near Reading , In 1952 Spain 's Duke of Alba visited Stratfield , and spotted the painting , told Ric Brown , then a Harvard Ph.D . studying in Europe , about it . <P> For five years Brown kept tabs on the painting , in January of this year got his board of governors to pay a Manhattan dealer $270,000 for it-the biggest sum spent by the museum in years . Says Brown , enthusiastically , " It 's the second-best Goya this side of the Atlantic. * It 's a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handiwork shows in every stroke . " <P> The Big Time . Brown has given Los Angeles museumgoers a taste of the excitement a hard-driving director can give art . By originating such outstanding shows as T'ang Dynasty Art ( TIME , Jan. 14 , 1957 ) , Brown has put Los Angeles back into the big time , has just staged the U.S. 's most comprehensive Degas show in two decades . One of Ric Brown 's few misses was the Edward G. Robinson collection . Brown rounded up $2,500,000 to buy it , only to have Greek Shipowner Stavros Niarchos raise the bid to more than $3,000,000 ( TIME . March 11 , 1957 ) . But under Brown 's quarterbacking , new pieces have come pouring in ( including Fragonard 's Mademoiselle Colombe as Venus from Marion Davies , an early Rembrandt and four outstanding Gobelin tapestries from Oil Tycoon J. Paul Getty ) . Attendance has swelled to over 1,000,000 a year .
