U.S. engineering schools are often criticized for being behind the scientific times ; their enrollments have stagnated . This week the Ford Foundation , which overlooked the field up to now , marched in with a massive $19.05 million gift to four institutes of technology ( Caltech , Carnegie , Case , M.I.T. ) and six universities ( U.C.L.A. , Michigan , Illinois , Purdue , Stanford , Wisconsin ) . The goal : a sharp boost for pace setters , and so for all U.S. engineering schools . <P> More than half the money ( $11.2 million ) is earmarked for improving faculties at eight of the schools ; it will pay for raising key professors to senior rank , financing faculty loans and summer fellowships , will set up 15 new professorships and help lure top engineers into teaching . The rest of the money goes into improving curriculums , notably for new programs ( at Case , U.C.L.A. ) that concentrate on design as a basic engineering discipline . Biggest beneficiary : M.I.T. ( $9,275,000 ) , now developing a curriculum focused on science-core courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , explained Foundation President Henry T. Heald , to encourage engineering schools to impart " a thorough understanding of science and mathematics , their frontiers , and how they may be applied to the needs of mankind .
