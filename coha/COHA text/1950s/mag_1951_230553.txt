It was a bitter week for Hungary 's Roman Catholics . Into Budapest 's Parliament building walked Archbishop Julius Czapik , the eight remaining bishops of the Hungarian hierarchy and the heads of four religious teaching orders . Hands to hearts , they swore " to be loyal to the Hungarian People 's Republic . " <P> Their oath-taking , 2 years after the trial and imprisonment of Cardinal Mindszenty , showed that the Reds have apparently erased the last open resistance of the church inside Hungary . Three weeks before , the same bishops obediently declared their support of the Communist " Peace Movement of Catholic Priests " -a support which Archbishop Josef Grsz , Mindszenty 's successor as Hungary 's primate , also in prison , had steadfastly refused to give . <P> Outside the country , a Hungarian church in exile is growing swiftly . Its communicants : 200,000 refugees who have fled since 1945 . Its frontier outposts : a dozen relief stations in Western Europe ( mainly Austria ) , where the Hungarian Caritas ( Catholic welfare organization ) , financed by U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage to slip across the border . The Vatican 's man in charge : Monsignor Josef Zagon , 42 , onetime chancellor of the diocese of Gyr and follower of Cardinal Mindszenty , who escaped from Hungary just before the cardinal 's arrest . <P> As minister to exiled Hungarians wherever they may be , Monsignor Zagon bears the title , Apostolic Visitor Extraordinary . The title reflects the worldwide dispersal of his flock : 100,000 of them in Free Europe , another 100,000 scattered in North and South America and Australia . One of Zagon 's jobs is to provide them with Hungarian-speaking priests , from a pool of more than 250 who are under his administrative direction . He also has general responsibility for 125 Hungarian seminarians , now continuing their theological studies at various European schools-men who can carry on the old tradition . <P> From his headquarters in Innsbruck , Zagon keeps in precarious touch with Catholics inside Hungary . Refugees report that despite persecution of the hierarchy , parish churches have never been so full . Because almost any preaching may expose them to Communist wrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of preaching sermons . The prayer " Free Me from Evil " draws such a response as to be almost a political demonstration .
