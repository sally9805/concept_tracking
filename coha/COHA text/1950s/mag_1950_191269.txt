As the Voice of Moscow in the U.S. , New York 's Communist Daily Worker ( circ. 23,400 ) has caused many an anti-Communist American to wonder if it is entitled to all the privileges of a free press . Last week the executive board of New York 's Newsdealers Association , whose members run the city 's newsstands , decided that the Worker was not . The board voted to bar the Worker from newsstands and asked the association 's members to approve the proposal . <P> The Worker was quick to scream " freedom of the press , " and it got quick support from solidly capitalistic and bitterly anti-Red sources . Said Scripps-Howard 's World-Telegram &; Sun : " We know how the newsdealers feel . . . However , there are authorities properly empowered to discipline traitors and silence their publications . It certainly is not for the newsdealers to set themselves up as censors . " The New York Daily News agreed and added : " The Worker is one source from which Americans can learn plenty about their Communist enemies . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to be available ... to the handful of people who ever want to buy it . " <P> All this ( plus a court restraining order obtained by the Worker ) gave the Newsdealers Association pause . It decided to poll all New York newsdealers , both in &; out of the association , before it acted .
