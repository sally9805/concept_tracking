The Federal Reserve Board last week cocked an eye at the big bull market and tried to put a crimp in speculation . It raised margin requirements from 50% to 75% . <P> The FRB action was mainly a political move to show that , after cracking down on housing and retail credit , it was playing no favorites . Actually , there was comparatively little credit in the market . On Jan. 1 , the amount of borrowing on stocks by New York Stock Exchange members was only $698 million , less than 1% of the total market value of listed stocks . Such credit was actually lower than in July , when the market itself was far lower . In short , the market 's rise had been caused almost entirely by cash buying-notably by pension funds , investment trusts , etc . Last week the market proved again that it did not need the credit . The same day margins were raised , stocks rose to a new high of 248.01 in the Dow-Jones industrial average .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
