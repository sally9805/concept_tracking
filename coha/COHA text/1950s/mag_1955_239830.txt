Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru , a cousin of India 's Prime Minister and a dear old lady whom everyone likes , took her idea to Indian leaders . Why not , said she , collect cultural , religious and scientific dignitaries of Asia into one grand " nonpartisan " conference to promote the cause of peace and brotherly love ? The idea came to her , or was put to her , at last year 's Communist-run Stockholm conference for " the reduction of world tension . " Cousin Jawaharlal and leaders of his Congress Party gave their consent . Invitations went out to the capitals of Asia . and Indian President Rajendra Prasad agreed to welcome the delegates to New Delhi . The Congress Party 's tough anti-Communist Bombay Boss , S. K. Patil , rounded up a delegation to participate in the proceedings . The press began touting the affair as an official precursor to the impending 29-nation Asian-African conference at Bandung , Indonesia . <P> But when the delegates streamed into New Delhi last week , a Red-tinted film of disillusion settled about Mrs. Nehru 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and priests could not speak English , the official conference language , but the delegations from Moscow , Peking and the other Communist capitals were all big coveys of English-speaking propagandists , each ready to spout like shaken-up soda pop the moment the meeting opened . S. K. Patil came in from Bombay with his Congress delegation , took one look at the Red assemblage and withdrew in anger . " It is just another front organization with the Communists running the whole show , " he snorted . Questioned about it in Parliament , Prime Minister Nehru sharply withheld his endorsement from the meeting . The Indian public generally shunned the convention gallery . <P> Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru got one opening-day opportunity to welcome the delegates ( " Seeing you here is like a dream " ) and speak up for Cousin Jawaharlal 's Pancha Shila- " five principles of coexistence . " Then the Communists pushed the well-intentioned to the back of the stage and took over . " It 's all very confusing , " murmured one of Mrs. Nehru 's friends . One by one , Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peking 's loudest guns , vowed that Peking will not rest until it has conquered Formosa from the Nationalists . " It is a part of China just as Long Island is a part of the U.S. , " he said . <P> The next performance of the Communist road show will be at Bandung this week , where the audience will be delegates who , in theory at least , represent more than half the world .
