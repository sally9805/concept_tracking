Into Washington came a cry for succor from a kingdom even more distant than Jordan . The supplicant : the royal government of Laos , whose small territory is bordered on the north by Red China , on the northeast by Communist North Viet Nam . Laos ' plea : the U.S. , along with Brit ain and France , should reaffirm its support of the Laos government against Communist pressure-particularly from the two Communist-controlled provinces in northeastern Laos . Reason : under the terms of the 1954 Geneva agreement which ended the Indo-China War , the two Red provinces were to have been reintegrated with the mother country . <P> Instead , charged independent Laos , the Communists have in effect demanded that the free section of the country move into the Communist orbit as the price of integration . For example , the Reds want the independents to accept aid and technical advice from the Chinese Communists and to create a coalition government in which the Communists would get such posts as minister of interior and defense . Moreover , the Communists have been attacking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance of their conditions . <P> From Washington last week came word that Laos had got the reassurance it needs . Gist of the State Department note ( similar ones went out from Britain and France ) : the U.S. continues to support the authority of the royal government " over all its territory " and " welcomes the firmness " with which it has resisted the Communist reintegration terms . Net effect of the reassurances : to put the Communists on notice that any dirty work in Laos could easily bring down on them the full force of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization .
