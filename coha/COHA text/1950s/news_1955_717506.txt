txt Of all the agencies in the Federal Government none carries a heavier responsibility year in and year out than the Federal Reserve System , whose thankless task it is to manage the nation 's money supply with the sole objective of keeping the economy on a reasonably even keel . The System emerged thirty years ago out of the urgent need to prevent recurrences of the banking panic of 1907 . But during the most successful years of its life it has based its policies on the fundamental philosophy that , while it is important to do everything possible to alleviate the conditions produced in recessions or depressions , the best way to deal with such conditions is to prevent them from developing in the first place . In a vast majority of cases business recessions or depressions are a direct consequence of a failure to perceive and curb excesses in the preceding " expansionist " phase of the business cycle . The Reserve has before it at all times the most comprehensive body of information bearing on the state of the economy of any agency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking long before it is available to the rest of us . Moreover , it sees it more clearly and more objectively because , unlike elective bodies , and especially groups that have identified themselves with special interests or segments of the economy , it is comparatively insulated from political and emotional pressures . Though all of this is a matter of general knowledge , it is rarely that the Reserve is able to pursue any definite policy ( or even no policy at all ) without drawing criticism from the politicians . Some might say that it is criticized only when it seems to be acting to head off what a great churchman as well as a great philosopher once described as " that delectable calamity , inflation . " Actually , it is likely to be criticized even more severely in the long run if hindsight seems to reveal that it failed to curb inflation when it should have . In 1953 a number of members of Congress denounced the monetary authorities for what they called their " hard money policy . " Though subsequent events have since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , they have n't prevented a recurrence of the same phenomenon . Last week 's step-up in the rediscount rates of most of the regional Reserve banks has produced an outcry among some Congressmen in Wash ington , particularly those who had been identified with inflation as a way of life or who are agitated by the realization that one or more of their special political preserves is vulnerable to any policy which has as its aim the curbing of inflation . As a consequence , hearings have been set for next week . Their purpose , apparently , is to determine why the Reserve elected to put the interests of the economy as a whole ahead of that of some areas dear to the heart of the Congressman . The reasons for the policies now being pursued by the Reserve are not far to seek for anyone who is genuinely Interested in the facts . For example , consider what has been happening in bank credit . In the week ended last Wednesday business loans by the leading banks of New York City , for example , expanded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row and it carried such loans to a second successive peak at $8,928 millions . The business loans of the banks in the nation 's major cities have risen by $2 billions since midyear in the face of steadily firmer regional reserve bank rates . ( A year ago in the corresponding period they were declining by $750 millions . ) Debt in the form of automobile installment credit has expanded by 35 per cent over the past year to $13.9 billions . At the same time mortgage debt , at $82.1 billions , is 17 per cent higher than it was at this time last year . Perhaps , however , the forthcoming hearings may not be entirely without merit . They should give the man in the street a chance to decide , for example , whether it is wise to permit the building boom to go completely unchecked at a time when the cost of building materials has risen 8.4 per cent in the course of a little over a year  --  and this at a time when wholesale prices as a whole have been moving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
