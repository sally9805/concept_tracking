txt Britain had a- fling today . The three day August bank holiday , traditionally the nation 's biggest fun and rest week-end , is in full swing . A London newspaper described the week-end as " the biggest , brightest , busiest , and best " holiday the nation has ever had . It did not exaggerate . It could have added the adjectives happiest and most serene . Even the weather was perfect . The weather bureau had to go back to 1914 and 1939 to find equally attractive weather , but saw nothing ominous in that . War was in no one 's thoughts today . In the United States a bank holiday is called a legal holi ' ' ' day . Britain has six a year . Million Quit London About a million Londoners left town by auto but traffic jams were few as many of the drivers took to the back roads . Seven hundred thousand others departed by train , and 50,000 by air . Only the air-borne got out of the country in large numbers . Seaside towns are packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bathtubs and autos , on beaches , and on moors . London is far from deserted . Hundreds of thousands of country families have come to town . They stroll the streets , band in hand , crowd the railings of Buckingham palace , feed the pigeons in Trafalgar sq . and test that newest American import , the hotdog , in the new cafes near Piccadilly Circus : Never Had it So good Britons never had so much money in their pockets . The Bank of England has the equivalent of almost six billion dollars in circulation . And the nation 's shops , hotels , cafes , pubs , entertainers , and transporters never before offered so much to spend it on . By American standards , people are n't buried in money . But by and large they have more than they once dreamed of having and enough to provide what they think a good bank holiday requires , be it only whelks snails ) , jellied eels , hot beer . and a cruise on the river Thames .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
