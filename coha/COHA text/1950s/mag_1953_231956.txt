Martin Luther ( Louis de Rochemont Associates ) has already broken attendance records in Minneapolis , where it had a special pre-release run . Partly responsible for its success is its surefire subject . Hollywood might long ago have turned out an epic on the life of the great reformer if it were not for an understandable reluctance to jump into a religious controversy . <P> But good potential box office as the subject is , only a sort of minor Protestant miracle made Martin Luther possible at all . It was made for church release , and under the sponsorship of not one but five church bodies : the American Lutheran Church , the Augustana Lutheran Church , the Evangelical Lutheran Church , the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod , and the United Lutheran Church , plus the National Lutheran Council of the U.S.A. Surprisingly enough , they were able to get together on so delicate an undertaking as a movie about their founder . <P> To film Martin Luther , the Lutherans chose a moviemaker who is capable of resisting Hollywood 's inclination to see every religious picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boundaries ) likes authentic outdoor sets and on-the-spot extras , and Producer Lothar Wolff sent him to western Germany to get plenty of both . To play Luther , Wolff chose British Actor Niall MacGinnis , surrounded him with a varied cast , and began to shoot scenes in 12th century Maulbronn Cloister , Eberbach Cloister and the castle at Eltville ( instead of Luther 's Wittenberg , which is in Russian hands ) . Even more impressive than the authentic sets are the intense , characterful faces of the extras . <P> The film takes Martin Luther from his doubt-filled student days through the whole dramatic flowering of Protestantism . There are notable soft-pedalings ; the Peasants ' Revolt ( 1524-26 ) seems to be telescoped with the iconoclastic excesses of one of Luther 's too enthusiastic followers , and the rallying of the German princes to Luther 's side is tricked out in more Christian idealism than most historians give the princes credit for . But by &; large , the action and the dialogue , drawn mostly from Luther 's own written words , are both accurate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
