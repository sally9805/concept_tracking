The moderate Christian Democrats , who have governed Italy since World War II , emerged again last week , in Italy 's first national election in five years , as the country 's strongest political force . But despite general prosperity , their twelve-year grip on office and their excellent , tight-knit political organization , the party failed once again to win a majority . A curious sort of apathy , which could hardly be dismissed as electoral indifference when 94% of those eligible voted ( compared to the 50% average turnout at major U.S. elections ) , hung over the campaign . Perhaps the reason showed in Party Boss Amintore Fanfani 's tepid victory cry : " We can continue to guarantee progress without adventures . " <P> The Christian Democrats , in a nation 99% Catholic , were dogged by Italy 's old anticlericalism , and by lack of a forceful , unifying leader such as Germany 's Christian Democrats have in Konrad Adenauer . Two years after Hungary , the Communists and fellow-traveling Nenni Socialists continued to poll 36.7% of the vote , a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputies : <P> Seats % of Vote <P> Christian Democrats 273 ( + 10 ) 42.4 <P> Communists 140 ( -3 ) 22.7 <P> Nenni Socialists 84 ( + 9 ) 14 <P> Neo-Fascists 24 ( -5 ) Under 5% <P> Social Democrats 23 ( + 4 ) " <P> Monarchists 23 ( - 17 ) " <P> Liberals 16 ( +3 ) " <P> It was in poverty-stricken southern Italy , where the government has been lavishing billions of lire on public works , that the Christian Democrats picked up almost all of their 1,500,000 new votes . There they scored heavily off the Monarchists and Neo-Fascists , who between them lost 22 of their 69 Chamber seats in the biggest slideaway of the election . Naples ' swashbuckling , 70-year-old millionaire Monarchist Achille Lauro , onetime mayor of the city , was not even elected to his old Senate seat , and appeared finished as a serious political force in Italy . <P> In the new Parliament , the Christian Democrats lack 26 votes for a majority . Either they will have to shuffle along with their present one-party minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will have to scout up allies from at least two parties . Possible combinations : join with the free-enterprising Liberals and the Monarchists to form a government leaning to the right , or try to enlist in a center coalition both Giovanni Malagodi 's Liberals and Giuseppe Saragat 's Social Democrats , whose leaders dislike each other . First the Christian Democrats must choose one of their own to be Premier .
