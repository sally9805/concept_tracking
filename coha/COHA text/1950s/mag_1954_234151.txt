A lonely stretch of highway between London and Portsmouth has become known to the mystery-loving British as Missile Mile . In 1950 Radio Announcer Richard Dimbleby complained to the Surrey police that the windshield of his car had been shattered on that bit of road . The police refused to get excited until car after car suffered the same dam age on the same stretch of highway . After investigation , they announced that the windshields had been smashed by stones thrown up by speeding cars . <P> The local council ordered the road swept daily , but the damage did not stop , and theories multiplied . The police went hunting , sometimes with dogs , for snipers with stones or rifles . They caught none , and found no projectiles that might have done the damage . Besides , the nature of the damage , a near-opaque network of tiny cracks , did not suggest any solid missile . Said one victim : " It was just like a shutter came down over my eyes . " <P> As the score of smashed windshields mounted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the mystery its best sleuthing treatment , arrived at no solution . The National Road Research Laboratory made test runs to see if the road had a vibration period that smashed windshields . It did not prove its case . The Air Ministry denied that its jet planes could have smashed the windshields with supersonic bangs . Some victims blamed a new kind of glass used in British automobiles , but the same glass does not shatter mysteriously in other parts of Britain . <P> London 's Sunday Graphic discovered that the British government has a secret laboratory only 700 yards from Missile Mile . The lab is hidden behind a country house and surrounded by electronic keep-out warnings . Its job , said the Graphic , is to convert electrical energy into " intensely concentrated pressure waves , " and the waves are smashing the windshields . The government admitted the laboratory , but denied everything else . It may be fibbing patriotically , of course , but if the powerful waves exist , they must be odd ones , breaking only windshields , never house windows or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from a lover of British tradition : that Britain 's notorious ghosts , modernized , are now breaking windshields instead of merely rattling chains . If so , they are still unexorcised . Last week the 87th windshield was smashed on Missile Mile .
