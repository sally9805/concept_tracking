Back in the U.S. last week was a 92-man team of ambassadors to the Far East . <P> Behind the Symphony of the Air lay a 42-concert tour of Japan , Korea . Okinawa , Formosa , the Philippines . Thailand , Malaya and Ceylon that endowed the U.S. with musical glory and cultural good will , and provided the indefatigable 92 with eight weeks of experiences that will give them anecdotes for years . <P> They flew the 30,000 miles mostly aboard Military Air Transport Service and Air Force planes . Unpressurized cabins brought ear trouble . There was a running gag of one violinist asking his neighbor , " How did I play tonight ? I could n't hear myself . " One flight , between Tokyo and Seoul , ran into a storm so Wagnerian that everyone but Director Don Gillis became violently ill . Gillis. with an oxygen tank but no mask , dashed up and down the plane spraying groaning musicians in the face with oxygen . " It may or may not have helped , " he says . <P> Unstuck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glued parts of viols and woodwinds regularly came unstuck ; humidity snapped the strings of three violas during Beethoven 's " Eroica " in Ceylon . The heat could untune a piano half a tone in two hours and rot a dress suit in a matter of days . In Bangkok , with a temperature of 105 onstage and no fans , U.S. Ambassador John Peurifoy came backstage to insist that the men take off their white jackets . After that they often played in shirtsleeves , delicately abandoning suspenders in favor of belts . In Manila an enthusiast presented them with sport shirts decorated with pictures of Maestro Arturo Toscanini , who trained the orchestra ( as the NBC Symphony ) , and left in the spring of 1954 . <P> As the tour progressed , the musicians in Panama hats , sport shirts and shorts , began to look less and less like a symphony orchestra . Most of them bought cameras and camera equipment in the PXs ; some went about festooned with three cameras . So avid was the search for souvenirs that the airplane pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you guys are going to buy another 2,000 Ibs. of stuff so we can get lighter by feathering the props . " <P> Converted . Everywhere the reception was enthusiastic-even from people who had never heard live Western music , e.g. , the Okinawans , who kept moving their heads to see where each new sound was coming from . In one community , between Kobe and Osaka , Conductor Walter Hendl , 38 , stepping outside between numbers for a breath of air , discovered hundreds of Japanese who had been unable to get in standing with their ears pressed to the wall . <P> " I 'm going back , " said Pianist Hendl last week . " Probably before the end of this year I 'm going back by myself . Whatever I am capable of contributing to Eastern culture in the way of Western music , I want to contribute . The tour we just concluded clearly affirms something I 've always believed : that the greatest of music , which transmits the greatest of human messages , is understood everywhere .
