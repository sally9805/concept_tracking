Color Guns Color Guns <P> By the novel expedient of changing horses in the stretch , Radio Corp . of America made a surprise spurt in the color television sweepstakes. * Abandoning the " dichroic mirror " cathode tube which it had used through the past 3 months of demonstrations before the Federal Communications Commission , RCA last week unveiled a new , all-electronic , direct-view color tube to some 60 newsmen at an NBC studio in Washington . <P> Two Types . Staring at three TV sets , the newsmen watched a program of Latin American singers and dancers broadcast from the Wardman Park Hotel , three miles away . Two of the three sets showed the program in color that ranged from fuzzy to fairly clear . The third set , an ordinary stock model , pictured the same program at the same time in better than normal monochrome-showing that RCA 's color telecasts could be received as black &; white by any of the 5,000,000 TV sets now in use , without adjustments or converters . <P> RCA 's new tube-which eventually may be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a single electron " gun " in the neck of the tube , which shoots a single beam of electrons-producing three colors : red , blue and green-onto the face of the tube . The millions of electrons are spun in front of a mask containing 117,000 minute holes , or one for every three dots on the viewing screen itself . The holes in the mask expose the incoming electrons to each of the color dots in turn , thus making a picture which approximates the color of whatever object or scene is being telecast . <P> The second type of color tube works in a similar way , except that each of the three colors is produced by its own special " gun . " Whenever a beam is uncovered by one of the infinitesimal holes in the mask , the right color dot appears at the right point on the screen . <P> The Threshold . RCA believes that either or both tubes may prove to be the final answer . " There are still some refinements we want to make . We are not fully satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Dr. Elmer W. Engstrom . " We want more dots , for one thing , to bring the definition of the picture up ... We feel sure that a tricolored kinescope of this kind marks the beginning of color television in the home . This marks the passing over the threshold . " <P> This week in Washington RCA and its closest rivals , CBS and Color Television Inc. , begin what may be the final tests before FCC . Whatever the result of FCC 's deliberations might be , it seemed clear that color TV had suddenly moved a bit closer from the distant future . <P> <P> *The purse : multimillions in royalties from the broadcasting industry and the U.S. public .
