THE WIRE H E SAID , " Beautiful morning , " which was certainly true and could not have been held against him : The first soldier was eating a sandwich sent out by the plant cafeteria . Hubble , approaching the gate , could smell hot mixed green pepper and onions . Preoccupied with this , he was quite unconscious of trouble . The gate was a wire door , somewhat less than man-sized ; one stooped and at the same time stepped over a low barrier . The first soldier said , " Surely is , Mr. Hubble , " and cocked his head to one side to eat some of the egg , which protruded from the toast in a delicious , overflowing curve . Hubble , going past , realized that he had had no breakfast . He was , in fact , half an hour late ; but he had phoned in , so it was all right . Their second car , a ten-year-old Ford with a cracked rear window , had broken down with a noise like the gnashing of nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife to the maternity clinic ; four-year-old Carol was left at nursery ; and these errands , plus the lack of food , had put him in a pleasantly dreamy state of mind . He had , in fact , felt a queer lightness in the effort of stepping through the gate . Last Tuesday night ( or was n't it Wednesday ? ) , the trunk lid of the car fell on his head . Something of a hypochondriac , Hubble wondered , at times , if he had suffered a fractured skull . He felt it : not even a lump . Of course , that would n't prove anything . He might be bleeding to death under the skull . The first symptom would be doublevision . He looked up : the factory , of pink concrete , and entirely windowless , was in perfect focus . So was the modest sign , Winnipeg Electronics . So , in fact , was this little world : the first gate , the gravel , the second gate with the second soldier , the Hash of the miniature sun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pathway , the 12-gauge woven wire mesh , like a nylon stocking under magnification . Most brilliant of all , were the barbs , the silvery points , of four strands of wire at the top of the fence , galvanized and facing inward . He immediately felt better . He crunched down on the new gravel as he walked . The passage between the first gate and the second was exactly one hundred feet long . Being late , he was entirely alone . The second soldier , whom he was now approaching , was a new boy ; he wore the regulation white gloves , and his webbing belt was new and immaculately white . Slowly and unaccountably , Bubble began to feel naked . He could now see the sun-bleached hair at the hack of the soldier 's head . The boy was studying his own glove , finding and picking an almost imaginary thread . Now the soldier turned and said , " One moment , sir . " At once Mr. Hubble knew why : he had forgotten his security badge . This item of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a safety pin at the back , and his photo on the front : a rather good photo , at that , for it had , by a trick of lighting , a certain romantic intensity which he affected twenty years ago , when he was seventeen , but which had disappeared with steady employment and a quiet marriage . The only relic of it , indeed , was his hypochondria . He believed very much and very fundamentally in the imminence of death , illness , bad luck , and total disaster . None of these had come his way , but he felt , nevertheless , a certain loyalty to these gloomy invisibles . Now , in the presence of this boy with the light hair and the doggish nose , they had come at last . " Where 's your badge , sir ? " said the second soldier in his clear voice . " Entirely justified , " said Hubble . E EXAMINED all his pockets , know- ing very well that the badge was on the dresser in the bedroom twenty-two miles away , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pink climber instead of a red . At last Hubble said , " Call Mr. Duggan , " ? Mr. Duggan was the security officer of the plant ? " he 'll identify me . " The soldier said , " He 's the one told me . " " Did lie ? " said Hubble . " Told you what ? " " No badge , no admission . " The soldier was barely eighteen . In his seriousness , he hardly moved his lips when he talked . " Look , " said Hubble . " Either call Mr. Duggan or let me call him . " At the same time , he stepped forward , rather belligerently . ' Ile phone was in a kind of shed , or sentry box , open along one side . As he turned , the soldier pulled his revolver , and they were so close that the steel barrel scraped the loose and careless button on Hubble 's tweed suit , Both men recoiled , surprised and somewhat excited by this physical contact . The soldier said . " Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hubble , as though it were a game of redlight , took thought for a moment , and then obeyed ; but spoiled the obedience with a smile . " Call him yourself , kiddo , " said Mr. Hubble , " Mr. Duggan , James R. Duggan . Extension 463 . " The soldier seemed perfectly able to remain without blinking . " Oh , for crisake , " said Hubble . " Call him . " " No necessity , " said the soldier . " You have no badge , you do n't get in . " " What 'll I do ? Drive all the way back home ? I live in St. Catherine . That takeS an hour . Plus an hour back . TWO hours . Something that could be settled in two minutes . " The soldier was perfectly quiet , except for an odd twitch in his left upper eyelid , only noticeable because he was otherwise so serene . MAGAZINE " Do n't be so goddam chicken , " said Mr. Hubble . The soldier looked at him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recommended in the manual , under civil disasters , riots , strikes , earthquakes , or the like : you were advised to be impassive . The word had bothered him a lot , he 'd looked it up in the library , argued about it at camp , one of those acrimonious debates that develop only in the boredom of the long barracks , the magazines all read and no cash till pay day . Filially , stubbornly , he had grasped what it meant : to look away , to look through all anger and all present disorder , and toward a distant , an ideal and quiet point ; and to remain perfectly calm , even dull , yet at the same time , inwardly of course , to be intensely alert and ready for action . Hubble saw this glaze come and settle down over the face of the boy , and he accepted this thing as final . He said , " AII right , soldier . I 'll go back home . Ridiculous . " lie turned around and began to walk the hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of dialing behind him . Turning , he saw the second soldier at the phone . He heard , or thought he heard , the bell ring several times . Turning forward , he realized that the first soldier , at the entrance , was answering his own phone ; that the two guards were in communication . He tried to hear what was said , but was ashamed of himself at once , and so , scoffing his feet , walked on toward the front gate . The first soldier hung up his phone , left his booth , and walked out into the sun again . He had finished his sandwich . Mr. Hubble was fifteen feet away from him and coming toward him . The first soldier was carefully sucking his teeth , crevice by crevice , and continued even as Mr. Hubble said , " Good morning again . I forgot my badge . Your buddy . He wo n't let me in . " " He told me , " said the first soldier . " Will you call 463 ? Mr. Duggan ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He do n't come Thursdays . You know that . " " Damn , " said Mr. Hubble . " Mr. Duggan , he comes Sundays , poor guy , so he do n't come Thursday . " Mr. Hubble felt guilty about this . Did he imagine a certain contemptuous familiarity in the soldier 's voice ? Or a kind of pity , like that of a guard for a prisoner on trial but not yet condemned ? He said , " Joe , now Joe . You know me , you 've seen me five days a week for a year and a half . Call up your buddy and tell him , " " I could , " said the first soldier . " I could . Sure I could . But it wo n't do no good , Mr. Hubble . " Mr. Hubble had a sudden insight : the first soldier had a single stripe on his sleeve , the second soldier had none . This difference in rank , minute at the top , say between Major General and Brigadier General , was enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Private First Class was almost intolerable ; yet when the lower man was right , the higher was put upon his mettle : he had failed , and he must do better . Mr. Hubble saw this inverted logic as the essence , the moral structure , the very reason of this hierarchy . Miserable , he began to lie . " Worse yet , " he told the soldier : " my car 's got a bum clutch . If I make it home and back , I 'll be lucky . I was going to trade it in last week " ? another lie ? " but they offered me such a poor deal " ? and he broke off and looked at his wrist watch . " Only trouble is , " said the soldier , " you ca n't go out this gate . " With his foot , the first soldier shut the wire door . " What ? " cried Hubble . No sir . Nobody leaves without they have a badge . " " But you just let me in ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , make another mistake , and for crisake let me out . " " Suppose you were a spy , sir . " if I were ! If ! If ! " shouted Hubble . " I 'd have two extra badges in my pocket , you can be damn sure of that ! " " Regulations , " said the soldier . His voice still smelled faintly of delicious egg , onion , and Pepper . " All right , " said Hubble . You know so much , you tell me what to do . " " 1 do n't know . Frankly , you should n't have come without that badge , Mr. Hubble . " Hubble pulled off his tweed jacket , walked back ten paces , folded it , put it down on the clean gravel , and sat on it . " If you 're going to be so goddam stubborn , so am I , " he said . He did n't know exactly what he meant . He smoked two cigarettes . His hunger passed . He leaned back against the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pattern into his shirt and doubtless into his skin . The sun glared down through a high cloudiness The gravel nudged at his ankles as he sat cross-legged . The morning smog , which tasted of ozone and electricity , crept up out of the great new industrial counties to the east and the southeast , and this fine prosperity smarted in his eyeballs . He was lonely . The two soldiers had returned into their whitewashed wooden shelters . S L O W L Y , as if from a great distance , he thought of Richard . He had n't seen him for many , many years , but the image was clear . A big young man , with excellent rosy health , and a broad , flat skull covered with hair almost oriental in its color and texture , ? all blue-black , thick , and shining . He was his wife 's youngest brother . He had been an insurance salesman in Montreal , later in the brokerage business , a foolish , pompous man , successful and confident . He still wrote them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all his security checks , forms , oaths , and oral interviews , had never once mentioned him , for he was quite certain that Richard was a Red . He now dismissed this thought , banned and banished it ; but his heart , a minute later , in the slow manner of the involuntary organs , leaped and squeezed in its fright . That was it . They had gone over his file . Someone had sent in a card ; " This so-called engineer Hubble or Huddle employed by you which 1 know positively has a brother a Commie . Signed , A Patri9t . " Cleverly , they had got him trapped between Gate One and Gate Two . He was being held , pending . Pending what ? The thought was real , but ridiculous . He began to get thirsty , but suppressed the feeling as mere weakness of character . Besides , in this angry attitude , seated on his uncomfortable jacket with his back to the wire netting , it was quite impossible to ask the guards for a i-4 e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * 4114:0 : - *. ? - mot .. ** - .. 1% ) ? I &; rfi.  - -  A ? : ? ? 00 : ? ? ? : : : : . vs , " ? i. .. / favor . They 'd judge it to be some ruse , some nasty trick to get them off guard . As a matter of fact , he should do something of the kind  --  amuse them , fascinate them , rile them up , get them out of their boxes , angry and upset . They 'd be bound to consult , and while they consulted , he could make a dash for Gate One . That would be that . Once outside , they could scarcely drag him back : it would be against regulations  --  no badge . He picked large , hand-shaped gravel from between his shoes , stood up , and like a boy , began to loft these stones at the pink face of the Winnipeg Electronics Building . It was too easy . The trouble was , without windows there was no really good target . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a small grillwork , an air intake duct high up and about two-thirds of the way from one corner to another . He began to hit it , too . It rang satisfactorily . The first soldier came out and advanced toward him ten paces . " Here now , mister . You ca n't do that . " " Oh , ca n't I ? " said Hubble . " You do n't know your own Regulations . Under Paragraph 210 , Section B and C. It says very plainly that citizens under arrest whose names begin with A to M , can exercise in the open air promptly at 10:30 . " " It 's not 10:30 , " said the first soldier . " It will be , " said Hubble . " It will be . Mark my words . " " Do n't get your bowels in an uproar , " said the first soldier . " Goddam ? " said Hubble . " I 've had no breakfast . I ca n't get a glass of water . Furthermore , what in the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I supposed to stay here ? For life ? You know me : do I look like a goddam commie ? Yes or no ? ? Do you go out with girls ? " " What ? " said the first soldier . The second soldier , finding the conversation more interesting , moved twenty feet closer , though he kept his hand on the holster . Hubble repeated the question , but in a plainer form . " On occasion , " said the first soldier . The second soldier was perfectly stolid , but his large , shiny feet , one by one , drew him toward Hubble . " You see , you see ? " said Hubble . " You 're not a machine , after all , are you ? Or are you ? Maybe you go out with the science-fiction crowd . Special robots . Cleverly designed sexual circuits . Tiny transistor tubes . Press the button , they squeeze your hand . Press another , they twitch their legs around you ? " " There 's no call to talk dirty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening , too ? " said Hubble . use " Up the Trish ? Do you mind if I the phone ? " " What for ? " " I do n't have to tell you . It 's not Regulations . There is a constitutional amendment to that effect . " " Smart , " said the second soldier . " Too smart . " " Let him phone , " said the first soldier . " Go ahead . You let him in . So ? Let hini phone . " " I 'll have to listen to what you say , " said the first soldier to Mr. Hubble . " I do n't mind , " said Hubble . " If you do n't mind . " He put on his jacket , dusted it , and got into the shelter . The first soldier crowded in with him . They were both sweating . Hubble dialed the plant and asked for Mrs. Reynolds , Personnel . She was an unpleasant woman , but he was determined to be pleasant to her . He told her his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh . " The whole thing is crazy , " he told her . " How do I know who you are ? " said Mrs. Reynolds on the phone . " You damn fool ! " cried Hubble . " Come out and look at me ! How many Hubbies have you got in the plant ? " She hung up . The first soldier said , " Women . " " You 're no better , " said Hubble . He went and sat down in precisely the same spot . He quit . He really quit . He did n't even bother to take off his jacket . He just lowered himself slowly onto the gravel . The sun rose steadily , the clout vanished into patches of feather , immensely high and almost transparent . An invisible and inaudible jet drew chalk-lines across the sky . The wire mesh on which he leaned grew warm to the touch . W H Y should she care ? " he mumbled half an hour later . " Why should anyone care ? Senior draftsman ! They can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some watergrass grew in thick , coarse heaps . He put his fingers through the mesh and pulled out some blades and chewed on them . They tasted wild , they tasted of freedom . He looked from one soldier to the other , separated again by the hundred feet of white gravel . They were still sweating under their plastic helmets . He said , aloud , " It 's true . I confess . " The soldiers could hear him , but they paid no attention . " I infiltrate , " he told them . " I undermine . I , am , a , rat . I 've got Winnipeg Electronics subverted to where they do n't know where their next beer is coming from . And you guys . Fools . Cannon-fodder . " He stood up . He orated . " You 're going to die on the battlefield . Why ? What for ? Those **43;1470;TOOLONG classes ? No ! You wo n't do it ! You ca n't ! Peasants in uniform ! Every man will get an acre of land ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliance of the gravel underfoot . They tett embarrassed , not at what he said , but at the very intensity of its nonsense . " Lay down your arms ! " cried Hubble . " Go back to your fields ! " He glared first in one direction , then in the other . " I got a candy bar , " said the first soldier . " If you care to have it . " " Opium of the people , " said Hubble . But the atmosphere , by this offer , had subtly changed . " Maybe you do n't like coconuts on the inside , " said the first soldier . " Many people do n't . " Still , he took the package , opened the cellophane at one end , walked up and offered it to Hubble . Hubble said , " Damned if I will . " " What 's that you 're giving him ? " said the second soldier , at his anxious distance . " Candy bar , " said the first . " Always eating , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll get fat ! " Hubble said , " I had no breakfast . " But he said it mildly . He took the candy bar and began to chew . It was delicious . " I do n't eat that stuff . Cavities , " said the second soldier . " You 've got cavities in the head , " said Hubble crudely . His mouth was full of chocolate . " Now Mr. Hubble , " said the first soldier , " look at this thing from our point of view . All I need to do is goof once  --  just once  --  and I lose my chance to make Corporal . " He pointed to the stripe on his sleeve . Hubble said , more reasonably , " Leave me here . I 'll stay with your pal . I wo n't be happy , but I 'll stay . You go to St. Catherine . Get a jeep . You 've got a jeep  --  I can see it from here . Go to St. Catherine and the badge is on my dresser . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't see it , so naturally I forgot it . Just lift up that nightgown  --  it 's blue , the only blue thing in the house . Or wait ! Maybe I 'm wrong . Maybe she put the shampoo bottle ? " The soldier had turned around and was looking toward the factory . Up on the invisible roof were about fifty or sixty people , mostly the girls from the drafting department , looking down toward him , from above , into the lung cage between the two gates . It was 10:15 , coffee break . There was perfect light , air , humidity , and temperature inside , dust-free and pollen-free , but for some curious reason , they preferred to take their Danish and their chocolate cruller and their wax cup of black coffee up to the roof , and stand and chat in the midmorning glare , with the sting of chemistry in the small of their eyes . Hubble jumped up and down , waving his arms . " Hey , it 's me ! Me ! " " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . Some of the bolder types threw kisses . There were other remarks , but a wind was blowing through the wire , and their shrieks were at the same pitch . All at once , Hubble began to enjoy his imprisonment . He hung his jacket on the wire . He did setting-up exercises , false impressions of opera , desperate gestures of hunger and thirst . The girls howled and applauded . " Hub ! Hub ! " they cried affectionately . They loved him for his madness . On one occasion he had convinced a Japanese girl working in the same room that he was an ex-bullfighter , turned cowardly . He even exhibited an appendectomy scar as proof . He showed her a friend 's letter from Mexico City , saying it was front his old manager . The Japanese girl pleaded with him to have courage to go back . He would n't . On another occasion a girl named Rosa , a maternal type , saw him come in one Monday morning , gloomy and hung over . She said he looked dissipated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave him alone , who exhausted him , he could n't find time for lunch , etc . He went on and on , elaborating , giving his complaint in a louder and loader voice , so everyone in the drafting rooms could hear . The girl fled . He pursued her along the corridor , still shouting and explaining . This incident made him famous . Mr. Hubble marched smartly up and down . He declaimed his daughter 's morning song : " Happy day , happy love , happy happy happy dove . " She was mad about rhymes . While be was marching and singing , the girls on the roof melted away and disappeared . Coffee break was over . Now , until lunch , there were two hours to come ; sterile , bright , enclosed with barbed wire . It was no longer nonsensical . It was now unendurable . The second soldier said , " St. Catherine . I had a sister lived in St. Catherine . She was a real big eater . She had six cherry trees . Finally she moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing he hated was this boy trying to be pleasant . Hubble left him and went grimly down the white gravel and knocked on the side of the sentry box . " There 's no door , " said the first soldier . " 1 just blew my top , " said Huhble . " Please , please , do n't make any further trouble , " said the soldier . " It 's happened ! " shouted Hubble . " The sun ! Beating down ! Mercilessly ! Lack of food ! Lack of water ! Call of nature ! Barbed wire ! The endless barbed wire ! " " Look . You do n't have to yell , " said the first soldier . " I have to yell ! You do n't believe me unless I yell ! " " Please , sir , please . Have consideration . " " I 'm psychotic ! Dangerous ! Get me to a doctor ! " The soldier was tired of this . He said , " Mr. Duggan is bound to call in . And when he does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of the service revolver at two points and tried to yank it out of the holster . The soldier swung around , Hubble hanging onto him . Their feet , knees , and shoulders banged and thrashed on the sides and floor . The phone in the shelter rang . The soldier put his polished shoe against Mr. Hubble 's chest and shoved him ten feet away , backward . Then he answered the phone , not particularly out of breath . " Well ? " he said . " Trouble ? " said the phone . It was the second soldier . The first looked out at Hubble , who was examining the gravel cuts on the palms of his hands . " No trouble . The man went psycho . " Hubble smiled , looked a hundred feet down toward the other box . The second soldier stepped out and took a long look at him . Hubble picked up some larger size gravel and began to hurl it at him . It was a long way . " Heads down ! " cried Hubble , and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first soldier in his sad voice . MAGAZINE " I would n't hurt him " ? he hurled another stone ? " for the world . " The first soldier got on the phone again . " I 'm going to get emergency medical , " he said . " It 's a phony , " said the second soldier . " It 's preferable , " said the first . " Do we have to go over this again ? No badge ? no pass " " Pass ! All right ! It says pass ! Pass ! Pass means walk ! It do n't say nothing about stretcher cases ! " The first soldier hung up in a rage . He dialed Emergency in the plant . In about three minutes , the first-aid group for odd Thursdays appeared on the double . There was Mr. Emile Francoise with a white arm band and a first-aid box . Also two boys from Shipping with a dirty canvas stretcher which they had trouble unrolling . All three had their security badges pinned bravely to their left lapels , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happy love , happy happy happy dove , " said Mr. Hubble . T H E Y let him walk to the stretcher , help get it straightened out , and lie down on it . The second soldier opened Gate 2 and let the stretcher party pass toward the factory . Hubble had got a cigarette from Mr. Francoise and was smoking it , face to the sky . As soon as he 'd been carried three paces beyond the soldiers ' jurisdiction , he got up and called out to them , " Many thanks , boys ! " For he felt he had wronged them in some way . Then he helped carry the stretcher back into the plant . The soldiers had nothing to say ; they tried not to look at each other . Casting its shadow from a high and still rising sun , onto the gravel , and heavy , somber , hanging on the wire mesh , was Mr. Hubble 's coat , which he 'd forgotten to take . It remained prisoner , dark , sullen , and tweedy , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
