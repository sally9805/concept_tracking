At the mountain whistle-stop of Balvano , 60 miles southwest of Naples , special train 8017 stopped for water . Then it struggled off into the rainy night-two locomotives tugging 45 freight cars jammed with some 700 passengers . In a damp , narrow , two-mile-long tunnel , train 8017 stopped again . <P> The incline was steep . As the wheels of the two locomotives spun on the slippery rails , smoke poured from the stacks , swirled about the passengers . In the caboose , still sticking out of the tunnel , a brakeman heard strange noises coming from the freight cars ahead , realized something was terribly wrong , ran back down the track to Balvano . When he arrived , Assistant Stationmaster Giuseppe Salonia-told by the next station that 8017 had not arrived-was trying to figure out where the train could be . Rescuers rushed to the tunnel in a locomotive . From inside came the sound of the stalled engines still puffing slowly ; bodies were sprawled beside the track ; 530 passengers had died of asphyxiation . <P> The date was March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident then because of the adverse effect it would have had on Italian morale ; the accident received little publicity after the war . Eventually 300 lawsuits , asking damages of more than one billion lire ( $1,600,000 ) , were filed by relatives of the victims . Not until last week , when the cases were pending before the Naples Appellate Court , did the Italian press give wide publicity to the worst accident in Italian railroad history. * <P> <P> *An even worse rail accident occurred in 1917 at St. Michel , near the Franco-Italian border , when a French troop train was wrecked , killing at least 535 , injuring 243 . Wartime censorship likewise hushed up the St. Michel disaster ; the full story was told 16 years later .
