Even in seedy , rough-and-tumble South Philadelphia , where the Daniels family lived in a three-room , $50-a-month apartment , Daniels Sr. was known as a hard-drinking no-good with a long record of arrests-burglary , assault and battery , stabbing , and slugging a cop . He was also rough on Marty , eldest of his six sons-a roughness that hardened into perpetual rage last fall , when the boy quit junior high school to take a job as a glassmaker 's apprentice , then bought a beat-up ' 46 Dodge . Marty 's father would not work-Mrs . Daniels supported the family as a $46-a-week bookbinding machine operator . But Marty 's father liked to drive Marty 's jalopy , and if he went out at night and found it short of gas , he would wake the youngster and beat him for not keeping a full tank . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive boil two weeks ago when his old man took his car and $40 in grocery money , went off on a drinking spree with a woman .

We were over in Jersey and we had a good time . " Telling his mother " I ca n't stand this any more , " the boy got into his car , drove off to find his pal . <P> Dead Aim .

As the two boys drove around all night , Marty poured out the troubles he was having with his old man . ended up by saying , " I 'm fed up with him . I 'm going to get a gun .

The plot was simple : the trio would drive to St. Peter 's church cemetery , just opposite the Daniels apartment , and hide behind the wall ; when Daniels Sr. turned up , Marty would shoot him dead . <P> The plan worked-except for one hitch . The three boys went down to the graveyard wall , loaded the rifle , sat down and waited for Daniels Sr. They waited for two hours . But when he finally lurched down the street , mounted the steps of his house and sat down , another one of his sons was sitting there . Marty Daniels , afraid he might hit his brother , passed the rifle to Marksman Ray . " Here , " he said , " you do the shooting . You 're a better shot than I am . " Marty 's dad was sitting with his knees up to his chest , and Ray allowed that from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place he wanted . Marty told him to aim so the shot would hit him in the chest . Carefully Ray Edwards aimed the rifle , squeezed the trigger , and shot Martin Daniels Sr. square in the chest . In the resulting confusion , the boys ran out of the cemetery , jumped into Marty 's car and drove to the Edwards apartment in Germantown.
