The tabloid New York Daily News , biggest paper in the U.S. , was in a congratulatory mood last week . But in its usual breezy manner the News added a new twist ; it was mysteriously congratulating itself . Said a News editorial : " The News congratulates numerous other newspapers , in New York and elsewhere . . . on the shrewdness and sense of their editors and owners in trying to copy so many features , practices and styles which were originated by the News . . . We can not congratulate the people who buy these other papers . We can only commiserate with them , and hope for their sakes that their eyes may be opened in due time . . . They do n't know what they 're missing . . . It 's a sad spectacle , which moves us to pity-though not to worry . . . " <P> In Manhattan 's fierce newspaper competition , another paper gleefully cleared up the mystery by explaining what the " sad spectacle " really was . The News 's circulation has steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2,402,346 in 1947 . For several months the News , which ordinarily publishes its up-to-date daily circulation figure in the paper , has been using its October circulation ( 2,075,000 ) instead . Not until last week were readers brought up to date again , told that circulation in January had slumped under the 2,000,000 mark ( to 1,925,000 ) for the first time in years . <P> After pointing this out , Hearst 's Daily Mirror , the News 's arch rival ( whose circulation has slipped as much ) , needled the News some more , saying : " They also said they originate and others only imitate . . . Heck , we remember last summer when the Mirror started the great ' Lucky Buck ' game that set the city and the nation on its ear . . . Weeks went by . Our friends ignored it . Then we heard the News was holding meetings . . . All those brains ! All that money ! What were they going to come up with ? Then came B-day . Our friends brought forth something called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , ' Lucky Bucks ' spelled backwards . " <P> The News 's President and General Manager F. M. ( for Francis Marion ) Flynn acknowledged that there was trouble. * To the News staff and others he reported that the " decline is a major reason for concern . " With every price increase in the paper ( from 2 to 3 to 4 ) , circulation has fallen off , and increasing costs have tended to catch up with income , thus cutting the News 's fat profits . The eleven-day Manhattan newspaper strike also cost the paper well over $1,000,000 in ads and lost the News readers it never regained . But if the News and General Manager " Jack " Flynn were " concerned , " they were still not gloomy . Said Flynn : " The News is still one of the strongest newspapers financially in the country . . . with more than twice the circulation of any other newspaper in America . " <P> <P> * There was also trouble from another source last week . A three-alarm fire broke out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , and doing an estimated $300,000 worth of damage . But the News missed not an edition .
