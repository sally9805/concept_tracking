Premier Charles de Gaulle asked France for a vote of confidence and this week got a thunderous shout of approval . An overwhelming 80% of French voters plumped for his version of the Fifth Republic . In De Gaulle 's home village of **25;12082;TOOLONG , where the Premier was an early-morning voter at the town hall , ' the count on his referendum was oui , 195 ; non , 1 . De Gaulle telephoned friends in Paris to assure them he was not the dissident voter . <P> The Gaullist sweep buried the opposition . De Gaulle won even in the virulently Red district of Communist Boss Maurice Thorez . In Louviers , whose mayor is bitterly anti-Gaullist Pierre Mendes-France , 69% of the ballots were marked oui . <P> The results in the overseas territories were as astonishing . Only French Guinea , in the control of tough anti-Gaullist Premier Sekou Toure , voted no . Senegal , Niger , even supposedly sullen Madagascar came through with thumping oui majorities . <P> In Algeria , where the French had feared the worst , the turnout was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of F.L.N.-haunted towns with loudspeakers urging : " Men and women ! You must vote for the referendum today . Do not be afraid of the fellaghas . For your better future , for the happiness of your children , vote yes ! " <P> The F.L.N. countered with a warning that if Moslems voted they were " committing suicide . " From Cairo , headquarters of the new Algerian " government in exile , " Premier Ferhat Abbas denounced the referendum as an " intolerable pressure " on the F.L.N. 's fight for independence . " Algeria is not France . The Algerian people are not French , " he cried . A French troop convoy was ambushed 90 miles east of Oran and 19 soldiers killed ; a portable polling booth was blown up near the Tunisian border ; in Tlemcen , a crowd watching an election movie was sprayed with F.L.N. machine-gun fire . <P> But the outpouring of Moslem voters stunned the most optimistic Frenchmen . Even in the mountains of Kabylia , once an F.L.N. stronghold , Moslem women swathed in traditional robes waited patiently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one pregnant Moslem woman defied doctor 's orders to take her place in line and produced her baby right in the polling station . In impressive numbers , they voted for De Gaulle . <P> With the impetus of victory , De Gaulle plans to fly this week to Algeria , the riven land which destroyed the Fourth Republic and which , its division unresolved , is the Fifth 's biggest problem .
