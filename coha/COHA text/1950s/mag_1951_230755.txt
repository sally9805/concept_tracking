THE FARMERS HOTEL ( 153 pp. ) - John O'Hara-Random House ( $2 ) . <P> <P> Novelist John O'Hara is an expert at pinning down two kinds of people : those who get hurt easily and those who have a genius for hurting them . His victims and victimizers usually meet in scenes charged with emotional or physical violence , frequently both , and almost always the heel has a field day at the expense of someone better but weaker ( Butterfield 8 , Appointment in Samarra , scores of tough , tense short stories ) . Usually O'Hara makes it plain that heels annoy him almost as strongly as he is drawn to them . In his last novel , the bestselling A Rage to Live , he was almost as sympathetic to the betraying wife as he was to the hurt husband . <P> O'Hara 's new novel , The Farmers Hotel , is news for two reasons : 1 ) at 46 , he has arrived at an almost Saroyanesque love of kindness , hatred of cruelty and stupidity ; 2 ) this is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small-town Pennsylvania hotel one snowy evening , it was only to make a phone call . They were both fortyish and married , though not to each other . But they were in love , the real thing at last . Howard Pomfret speaks to Martha just the way O'Hara has learned to write from Ernest Hemingway : " It was so long ago , Girl . I do n't want to remember her , I want to be with you . You 're my last love , my final love . " A few drinks , car trouble , and the blizzard outside decide the lovers to have dinner at the hotel . They are joined by other guests : some down-at-heel vaudevillians , a local doctor , a truck driver with too many drinks in him , the garrulous hotel owner and his assistants . <P> While the storm rages outside , all is good fellowship within . Then the truck driver , boorish and a little drunk , insults one of the vaudeville girls , quarrels with Pomfret and quits the party . Later , when Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver is waiting for them beside the road , deliberately smashes into them from the rear and kills them . <P> The Farmers Hotel is not only as pointless as any other death on the highway , it is also something O'Hara has rarely been : dull . If he was really trying to say something about love , violence and the irony of life , it never reached his typewriter . Not too many years ago , Writer O'Hara would have trimmed these 153 pages down to about 20.
