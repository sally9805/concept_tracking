txt Australians are blaming their chief source of wealth  --  wool ? for the economic woes behind their slashes in imports from the 1.7 . S. , Britain and other countries . The Menzies government halted all buying from the U. S. late last week , preparatory to issuing a new and reduced list of what can be imported from the dollar area . American sales to Australia totaled about $235 million last year  --  chiefly tobacco , textiles , metals , metal manufactures , machinery , oils , fats and waxes. - There are no details yet on which goods will be affected . Two weeks ago the government announced that its overall foreign purchases would be slashed 50% , with the reductions ranging up to 80% for such consumer items as automobiles , kitchen equipment and certain foods . Prime Minister Menzies said the action was designed to save Australia from bankruptcy . Australia 's excess of imports over exports would otherwise have been more than $1 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30 . Why is Australia so deeply in the red ? In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dollar area and the world as a whole , both of which have since vanished into red ink . Economy Tied in Knots For the answer , look at the many ways that wool has tied Australia 's economy in knots . Wool is the chief earner of the foreign currency Australia needs to buy goods abroad . In a " normal " year like fiscal 1949-50. wool exports accounted for $737 million of Australia 's $1,374 million sales abroad . Then came the big wool price boom , which shot the average Australian wool price from $1.76 a pound before Korea to $3.73 in March 1951 . This caused export earnings from wool to double in  --  the 1950-51 fiscal year . In the past 12 months , however , wool pi ices have been on the skids . They now average about $1.35 a pound for Australian fleece This has cut Australia 's export earnings  --  thus cutting its purchasing power abroad The value of greasy wool exports in the seven months ended January 51 fell to $341,190,000 from 5566,420,000 in the like period a year earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of Australia 's troubles . What happened to wool in the years since World War II ended has now resulted in a crt.is in the production of Australia 's other principal export Item  --  food . An idea of the size of these food exports can be gotten by glancing again at the composition of that $1.374 million worth of goods Australia exported in the " normal " 1949-50 fiscal year . Food shipments abroad accounted for $488 million of it . This year , however . Australia 's exports of frozen beef  --  which declined by 35,000 tons in the last three years  --  will he reduced still further . Last year 's exports of lamb were less than one-third of the average pi e-war figure , and Commerce and Agriculture Minister predicts there might he a fall of a fur ther 15% this year . Similar declines have taken place in mutton and pork exports , and in butter production . Grain Output Reduced The story is the same in grain growing . Fourteen million acres of wheat were planted in 1947 and yielded 220 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted , for a 160-million-bushel yield . Mr. dicEwen has announced that this year Australia would be unable to meet its commitments under the International Wheat Agreement . What caused the slump ? A factor in this year 's lag was a drought in northern Australia . But a more basic reason for the trend is wool . High wool prices induced grain growers to abandon crops in favor of cropping , as they watched the fortunes made by wool men . Cattlemen and dairy farmers also switched to wool . This switch has been going on over several years  --  not just since the Korean wool-price boom , though that accentuated it .. Wool returns had risen from the 62-cents-a-pound controlled price after the war to $1.21 in 1947 , $1.76 before Korea and on up until the price break last year . This movement of food producers to wool production ca n't be expected to be reversed overnight on the basis of the somewhat lower wool prices prevailing now . The food production decline comes at a time when Australia 's population is increasing by 3% a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woikers into the country this year and to step up loans to farmers ; it is considering exempting farmers ' incomes from taxes for three years . But some experts forecast that within a decade there will be no exports of beef and dairy cattle from Australia  --  and even that Australia may have to import food . : hough the latter fear probably wo n't materialize . Imports Zoomed At the same time that Australia 's export earnings from wool and food were declining , its imports were zooming  --  thus widenn.g the gap between what the nation was taking in and shelling out . Imports rose in 1951 from a level of $850 million to $1.250 million . , This as a result of the increased demand generated by the inflation left in Australia by the post-Korean wool price boom . The new import cuts are designed to stop this excessive buying abroad . Meanwhile , the government is trying to stem inflation at home and is meeting with some success . Taxes have been raised , public works expenditures have been cut and credit for homebuilding and car-buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's import cuts will be the British auto and textile industries . Australia bought 29% of Britain 's car exports last year and 26% of its exports of commercial vehicles . It is the biggest consumer of British cotton and rayon goods , too Australia cut its non-dollar buying to prevent the threatened exhaustion of the sterling credits it still holds in London . In addition , it is trying to trim its dollar purchases to the level of its dollar exports to prevent a drain on the gold and dollar reserves held by the sterling area as a whole .
