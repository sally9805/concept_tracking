U.S. art has its fair share of angry satirists , men with the sharp eye to puncture pomposity and the meat-ax strokes to level hypocrisy . Manhattan-born Painter Mitchell Siporin , 47 , chairman of the fine arts department at Brandeis University , is something rarer-a skilled craftsman who can combine wit with the feeling , technique and imagery of true satirical art . His luminous , thought-provoking watercolor , gouache and crayon imaginary portraits on view this week at the Downtown Gallery make a sprightly contribution to Manhattan 's fall season . <P> Poet &; President . Painter Siporin earned his professional spurs with the WPA in the ' 30s , and with Painter Edward Millman won a $29,000 commission to paint frescoes for the St. Louis Post Office . He served in the European theater with the Fifth Army as a war artist , and after the war he moved in and then out of abstract painting . Today , Siporin feels , there is little freshness in U.S. painting , and few ideas . His own latest works have some of both . Siporin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pairs , then his paint brush concocted the scenes of their meetings . <P> In Gangster 's Funeral Siporin has contrasted razor-thin Artist Jack Levine with menacing , heavyweight Gangster Al Capone , gently satirizing Levine 's evocative realism in the process . His Poet and President depicts a performance by the late poet Dylan Thomas , full of pixilating good spirits , cavorting before President Sobersides on the university lecture platform . Serenade from Don Giovanni juxtaposes the rakehell librettist Lorenzo da Ponte and the shy , youthful Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart playing a duet on mandolin and pianoforte . The Denial , portraying Novelist Franz Kafka , his fiance Dora Dymant , and the rabbi who forbade their marriage because Kafka was not a practicing Jew , is a conversation locked in silence . <P> Painter &; " Friend .

One hand is on the model 's shoulder and he is drawing with the other hand , as if the sensation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out through the pencil . It 's that intimate . " Siporin believes that " anything that is evocative , of intimacy or whatever , is the making of the painting . ' ' He painted his dialogues " to evoke the intimacy of a creative collaboration . You can sort of be in the room where it is being done . " <P> At their best , Mitchell Siporin 's ironical contrasts probe for similarities beneath the skin . Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience ( see cut ) sits William Blake and Toulouse-Lautrec down together , each with his own symbol ( a cupid emerging from an egg is taken from a Blake illustration ; Toulouse-Lautrec is backed by his poster of Jane Avril ) . Says Siporin . " The idea is sin , in a way . Both men had a very complex notion of sin ; both were preoccupied by it , but in different ways . Lautrec 's sympathies were with the prostitutes , but he had to have an idea of what was virtue and what was sin in order to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
