On the drawing board in Seattle months ago , Stanley Sayres 's two-ton , 29-ft. hydroplane , Slo-Mo-Shun IV , looked to him like the fastest boat in the world . When he got it onto Lake Washington this summer for its first official run , Owner Sayres rocketed to a world record 160 m.p.h . ( TIME , July 10 ) . <P> A month later , with Designer Ted Jones at the wheel , Slo-Mo-Shun IV won motor-boating 's famed Gold Cup . Last week on the Detroit River Slo-Mo-Shun took the last big prize within reach . It ran away with the international Harmsworth Trophy and , in the doing , pretty well established itself as the greatest speed boat ever built . <P> With Designer Jones out of action with a broken hand , Sayres turned the wheel over to steely little Lou Fageol ( rhymes with gauge all ) . Lou , 43 , a racedriver since 1928 , had never competed for the Harmsworth , but in the first of two 40-mile heats he hit the starting line almost at the crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30-ft. rooster-tail wake steadily drew away from Horace Dodge 's My Sweetie , Jack Schafer 's Stick Crust II , and Harold Wilson 's Miss Canada IV . Slo-Mo-Shun 's speed over the windswept course was 91.127 m.p.h. , a shade under the old record , but fast enough . The winning margin : three miles . <P> In the second heat next day , with the Canadian entry out of the running because of broken plankings , Slo-Mo-Shun gave up dawdling . With a look at the smooth water , Sayres told Driver Fageol : " Try one lap at 100 m.p.h. or better . " Lou opened the throttle of his 1,800-h.p . Allison engine , tried for one lap , then another and another ( " She ran so smoothly I just decided to keep my foot down " ) . By the end of the second lap , My Sweetie had dropped out with a broken oil line . By the sixth lap , Slo-Mo-Shun was a full five miles ahead of Such Crust . To the 150,000 spectators crammed along the banks of the Detroit River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new record . He got it . <P> Slo-Mo-Shtin 's average speed for the second heat : 100.68 m.p.h . Old record : 94.285 m.p.h. , set last year by Stanley Dollar 's Skip-a-Long . Jubilant Auto Dealer Sayres was delighted over his boat 's performance , but he was already taking a look ahead . Said Sayres : " We have a faster boat on the drafting board now . . . 200 m.p.h. is not impossible . "
