( See Cover ) <P> This week once again the great American taxpayer-that irascible and yet docile composite of the butcher , the baker , the candlestick maker , John D. Rockefeller Jr. , Senator Taft , John L. Lewis and the fellow next door-was working over his income-tax return . He did not do the job happily , or-in a year when he could n't quite decide whether his country was at peace or at war-even very patriotically . The feeling that an enormous eye in Washington watched him as he wrote down his deductions was often all that kept him from cheating-and sometimes that did n't quite keep him honest. * <P> He hated the dreary toil of filling out his complicated , sometimes incomprehensible income-tax form , and was inclined to have wild , triumphant daydreams about finding on the street a big bundle of unmarked small bills which he could bury without the knowledge of the Bureau of Internal Revenue . As he entered item 6 , added items 2 and 3 , and fumbled distractedly with old dentist 's and gasoline bills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling-as if he expected to see a little loudspeaker push through the plaster and hear President Truman 's voice saying softly : " Oh , pshaw , Jim , we 've decided to call the tax off this year . " <P> Look , No Clubs ! Such remission from on high could no more come to the American taxpayer than to Atlas , the Greek weight lifter . On the taxpayer 's shoulders rest the defense of the free world , the salaries of 2,500,000 U.S. Government employees , the care of Eskimos , and the spaghetti supply of Naples . The American taxpayer is the latest product of aeons of human progress . From his forefathers , despots were able to extract , under club or sword or torture , a livre here and a bushel of turnips there . But every dime the American taxpayer gives up has been voted out of him by his duly elected representatives . <P> The process of gathering the American income tax is so efficiently organized , so highly buttressed by every device of triumphant capitalism that it costs only 50 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a high standard of living that he sometimes pays more in taxes than it costs him to feed himself and his family . <P> He has just footed a large part of the bill for the greatest war in history . He is riding the crest of the greatest boom in history . In 1952 , he is about to attempt the greatest feat of all . He is going to give up $62.6 billion , more in a single year than the U.S. Government collected in the whole leaf-raking decade of the ' 30s-and almost a third again as much as in the most expensive year of World War II . Of this $62.6 billion , almost half ( $29.3 billion ) will come from the individual income tax , not an American creation , but one which the Americans , with their genius for large-scale organization , have brought to its fullest flowering . <P> The biography of the American income taxpayer is a story of surprises-and the biggest surprise may be still to come . It can be viewed as a victory of human progress or as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income tax began , the mass of American voters thought they were taking a swing at a fellow named Pierpont or Cornelius . The blow , in full and crushing measure , now lands each March 15 on the chin of a fellow named John Q.
