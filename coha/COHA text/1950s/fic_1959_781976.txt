 | Joab grunted . He did n't need a girl to tell him about King Saul . A woman 's loose tongue had brought David into today 's peril . No doubt this talky girl with the dark , wide eyes and the soft , wide mouth was one of those whose eyes followed David as he moved about the camp . To which of David 's men did she belong ? Which of them would she stir up against David with her prattling tongue ? He glanced at her again and decided she had not given herself to a man . Yet a talky woman was a troublemaker however young . A girl has no business going alone among the men of a camp , making herself free with a stranger at the fire . Women , he thought . They are more dangerous than all David 's enemies . But his eyes strayed back to the girl again , and when she smiled warmly he felt the hot blood wash up into his neck and cheeks . Reba watched the boy 's shy face , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the fire and went to her tent , then returned with meal and oil and began patting out cakes . The odor of the food reached the boy . She saw the twitching of his nostrils and knew he was hungry . Well , who was n't hungry in this place ? She smiled as she saw him covertly watching her hands . Her father often remarked on the grace of her hands when they were busy with small , homely tasks . She rounded the cakes carefully and laid them on a flat rock among the embers . " Since you are a newcomer , " she said , " you shall be my guest this morning . " Joab 's tongue flicked over his lips . He remembered that he had eaten nothing since Zeruiah made a meal for him in Bethlehem a very long time ago . He was ravenous , but he would not betray his eagerness to this free-and-easy girl . Reba said , " You are younger than most of the men . Did you come alone ? " Joab nodded . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chatter . " You are of Judah , are n't you ? You have n't told me your name ! " Clearly , thought Joab bitterly , it was nothing to this girl that David had gone with his men to destroy Nabal . Obviously she did not have sense enough to know that David 's world would fall apart once today 's violence was accomplished . He swallowed his irritation . " I came from Bethlehem . I am Joab . " " Bethlehem ? Then you know David ! " " He is my cousin . " Joab rose and took a stick and stirred the coals to hasten the baking of the cakes . Reba saw the tall strength of the boy , the awkward power of one who has grown fast and matured young . He is a cousin of David ! The thought brought a growing excitement . His home is in Bethlehem . And she thought , this is a man I could choose . She trembled and felt the blood pulsing behind  | her eyes . With this boy she could be warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethlehem . I would like to touch his face , she thought . I would like to make him look at me and smile at me . I would like him to hunger for me as he hungers now for the cakes . She said breathlessly , " Then you know Zeruiah ? And Seth ? " " I am a son of Zeruiah . Seth is oldest . I am next . Then there is Asa , my younger brother , who is fifteen . " Reba said , " Seth comes now and then , but he never stays . Will you stay ? " She held her breath , waiting for his answer . " Perhaps . " Bitterness curled his mouth . He is troubled , she thought . Oh , I would like to touch him , to comfort him . I would like to make him happy . " You will stay . David will keep you here . " " I will stay as long as David stays . " Words tumbled from her lips like water over stones . " David will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stay and protect them . My father had a vineyard and olive trees and a small barley field . Year after year the Philistines came raiding , always at harvest time . David would never go away and leave us to the Philistines again . I hate Philistines ! I saw one of them kill my mother . " Reba rushed on , wanting desperately to pour out her heart to this boy . She had never before spoken to anyone but her father about the things she felt closely . " I hate them so much  --  it is like a sickness . My mother 's body was thrown into the flames of our burning vineyard . Now my father is dead , killed by Philistines at Keilah . " She bent to turn the cakes , hiding her face . She felt so strange . Grief was an old and familiar emotion , but not this turbulent wish to weep and sing and laugh and to touch this boy and be close to him . I want to cry against his shoulder with his arms to comfort me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face to sizzle on the coals . He said roughly , " You are a girl . You can weep and make your troubles grow less . Why do n't you weep in your tent ? " Reba said softly , " Tears do not make trouble less . If they did , I would be free of trouble by now . " " Why do you stay in a place like this ? David has his hands full without bothering to look after a useless girl . " What would become of her , if David fled ? The devil take her ! Why should he care what became of her ? Reba said with dignity , " Whether I stay or go is my affair , and David 's . " She was angry now , with a veering of emotions like the veering of winds in changing weather . " A kinsman of David should not be so rude . I have been kind to you . Why are you rude to me ? "  | The boy 's gray eyes took on a look of shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are the nights always so cold in this clearing ? " " Always . Even in summer . " Her anger vanished as quickly as it had come . " But it is warm on the bluffs . See that path that zigzags to the top ? I used to climb it with my father and lie in the sun and be warm . We can go there , if you like . Now the cakes are ready and we will eat . " Joab gulped the first cake and the second and third . He did not notice that Reba was giving them all to him and eating nothing herself . He did not notice that her eyes glowed as he devoured the food she had prepared . " You make cakes as good as those my mother makes in Bethlehem , " he told her . He felt suddenly very kind toward the girl who had fed his hunger . Reba said gently , " If I had somewhere to go , I would leave this camp . But I have nowhere to go . David says I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . " Joab laughed aloud . " A husband ! You are too young to talk of choosing a husband ! " " I am grown . Men have asked for me . Even Benaiah , who is of the council . " " I have met Benaiah . " Joab spat into the fire . " I did not say I would marry Benaiah . Still , he is better than many of the young men . David depends on him . He is strong , brave , and honest . " Joab was looking at her at last . Even his mockery was pleasant . There was companionship in quarreling with a boy like this one . She smiled secretly , content with the derisive scrutiny of the boy 's gray eyes . She said , " I will marry when I am ready , and to the man I shall choose . " Joab said curiously , " You want to marry ? " " Why not ? A girl does not like to be alone . I have nobody to bring me spoil from the battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to . I am forbidden to leave the clearing by day or my tent by night . David says he can protect me only if I stay where people can keep an eye on me . Of course I want to marry ! To be alone as I am is no better than to be a prisoner . " Joab watched her with growing interest . Naturally she ought to live with someone . But not Benaiah ! Joab felt a stirring of the pulses , as he thought how some man would touch her , hold her , feel the lithe softness of her body against his own . What is it like to hold a girl and know her in the privacy of your own tent or room ? Women are the devil , he thought . He was angry again , because of the emotion which so disturbed him . You look ahead to death or at the best to a life of fleeing or hiding , or to the alternative of imprisonment in Hebron . And you know that an amorous woman has brought disaster to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find your head spinning  | because a girl with a soft mouth and smooth , dark hair speaks of becoming a wife to one of David 's young men . Joab jumped to his feet and strode off toward the bluff . He climbed the path Reba had pointed out to him . He would warm himself in the sun and forget the nonsense this girl had put into his head . He reached the slanting , rocky land which dropped away to the blue depths of the Dead Sea . This was the wilderness , a country on whose edge he had lived all his seventeen years , a country which stretched between the farmlands of the north and the shifting sands of the southern desert . The mystery and the color and the tantalizing odors of the wilderness beat on him , as always when he entered this land . He found a bit of sand where he could sit with his back against a warm brown rock , and let the sun burn through his woolen clothing . This was the wilderness , rough with boulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prickly with thornbush and cactus , riddled with large caves and small ones , threaded by dry , sandy , winding stream beds . Beyond the deep blue of the sea rose the purple mountains of Moab . In the middle distance a single palm tree rose to a considerable height , where a spring found its way up out of the earth to mark with green the golden land . On the slopes at this time of the year patches of bright flowers bedecked the earth , a riot of red poppies , white anemones , vivid yellow daisies and tall blue lupines . And Joab sat quiet , pleased as always with the springtime riot of colors and odors of the wilderness . But thoughts of Reba disturbed his pleasure . Life is crude and dangerous in a camp of outlaws , and women make it ten times more so . Women , he thought angrily . A stone dropped at his feet . He turned and saw Reba standing nearby . Her cloak was girded high on her straight brown legs . She pushed back her headcloth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace and freedom , and he noticed with a sense of sharp annoyance how level the brows were above her smiling eyes , and how feathery the hairline above her forehead . She said , " When the nights are long and cold in the clearing , it is hard to believe it could ever be as warm as this . " With the slow grace of ? a courtesan she loosened her girdle . The skirts of her cloak tumbled about her ankles . She held the girdle in her finger tips , then dropped it with her headcloth on the sand . She kicked off her sandals and curled her bare toes against the earth . Then she opened her cloak and let it fall in the heap with the other garments . She stood with arms stretched wide and eyes closed , her face raised like that of a pagan sun worshiper . Joab watched her in mounting fury . The tunic she wore was one which had fit her when she was still a child with a straight , unformed body . It  | was too short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched taut across her belly and breasts . He said harshly , " David told you not to leave the clearing . " She opened her eyes and smiled at him lazily , then came close and dropped into the sand near him . " You are David 's cousin . I came with you . David said I must not come alone . " He sees me now , she thought with pleasure . He really sees me . He wants me , at least a little . Joab , Joab , you are angry because you are greatly troubled . But you will not remain angry . You will love me , and I will love you , and we will make each other happy . Then you will take me to Bethlehem to live in the house with Zeruiah , who is not afraid of beast or devil or Philistine . She said softly , " I have been kind to you , Joab . I welcomed you and baked cakes for you . " She touched his face softly with her finger tips , smoothing the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are a pagan , a worshiper of Ashtoreth ! A girl like you makes nothing but trouble , just as Nabal 's wife Abigail has made trouble for David and all of us ! " " Who is Abigail ? Who is Nabal ? Who cares about them ? Who cares about them , Joab ? " She rose . Joab could not tear his eyes from her . Yet even while his tongue stuck in his mouth he wondered , how old was David when the girls of Judah and Benjamin first offered themselves for his de-light ? He said , gagging on the words , " You are a pagan and you stand here without shame for all the world to see . " He stood near her , not touching her . She was quiet . Her head drooped . " What shall I do , Joab ? How can I please you ? " " Go away from this camp . Go away from these men who hunger for you . " She raised her eyes . " I have nowhere to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you mean to marry one of David 's men . You will share his tent and bake his cakes and ? sleep under his blanket and ? " " Do you want me , Joab ? " Joab said thickly , " Perhaps I will die tomorrow . But today I will tumble a girl in the sand and forget this troubled Judah of ours . " Yet even as his fingers fumbled with his girdle he was wondering in panic whether this wench would laugh when she learned how lacking in practice he was at the game she seemed determined to play .  | 5 HEZRO RUBBED HIS shoulder against the boulder to relieve its itching . The shade cast by the rock was scant now , but would grow longer as the sun moved west . He stared through slitted eyes at the tilted golden world which dropped abruptly into the Dead Sea . " Hot , " he muttered . " Praise God for a little shade . " Below him and near enough so he could hear their incessant bleating , the sheep fed . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wadi where a tiny spring lived . Hezro had built up the edge of the pool with stones , this year as every year , but the sheep were already trampling the stones apart so that much of the water escaped to run down the wadi and lose itself in the thirsty sand . " Poor naked sheep , " murmured Hezro , smiling at the splotched backs of the newly sheared animals . Well , Nabal had trained the cutters at Carmel to get all the wool , even if you had to nick the skin here and there . Hezro pulled his headcloth lower over his eyes against the golden dazzle of sun on rocks and sand . He breathed deeply , filling his nostrils with the dry pungence of the sparse wilderness shrubs . Abruptly he sat erect . Here came the priest ! No wonder the fellow was addled . He never knew whether it was noon or midnight when he came galloping over the hills . He 'd cooked his brains in the midday sun . He looks like the front end of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and his thin shanks flying . Hezro settled back into the shadow of his rock . It exhausted him merely to watch that crazy fellow . The far side of the wadi was a steep hill , strewn with small stones which rolled under a man 's weight if he did n't watch his footing . Halfway up the hill was a patch of black where a small cave nestled under a flat ledge . The priest was climbing toward the cave , losing his footing when the stones rolled but always scrambling on again . In his arm he carried something which looked like a mud pie . When he reached the cave he squatted on his heels and stared around suspiciously . He stared down at the sheep as if wondering whether they were spying on him . He glared across the wadi at Hezro , and Hezro waved his hand languidly , then obligingly turned onto his stomach and pillowed his face in his arms . The priest and Hezro had met at this cave half a dozen times . Surely the priest no longer feared Hezro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times , carrying his mud pies . And he had seen him back out again after a while , carrying nothing . Hezro had gone a couple of times to investigate , but he never found anything . Hezro had concluded that the priest 's purpose in entering  | the cave was to perform some kind of hocus-pocus which would spirit the mud pie away into air . One never knew what a mad fellow like this Abiathar had on his mind . Hezro sighed and thought sleepily , Why does n't he rest in the heat of the day and play with mud pies in the cool of the evening ? Hezro would have slept , but for a troubling memory of a thing he had seen in the wadi at an earlier hour today . He 'd come down the wadi , leading his sheep to this oasis , when he 'd seen the boy , and a moment later , the girl . These outlaws , thought Hezro , fill the wilderness till you ca n't follow your sheep to water without stumbling over a brace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not counting the women and little ones . He 'd seen the boy when he rounded a bend in the wadi . The boy was watching him covertly , so you knew he was on guard for some reason . A moment later Hezro saw the reason . A girl lay asleep on one cloak , covered by another , while the boy himself wore only a tunic . The girl slept so soundly she did not hear the commotion the sheep made . Hezro had caught the bemused look on the face of the boy . The boy spoke a few civil words to him , but all the while his eyes wandered back to the sleeping girl as if he 'd never seen one in his whole life before today . Perhaps he never had , thought Hezro . These men of David 's lacked many comforts , and women were chief of the comforts they lacked . Some of their wives were dead . Some were at home in distant towns . Some of the men contented themselves with the favors of harlots when they could afford that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or with sneaking off at the full moon to join in the revels to Baal . There were a few women in the camps , a few wives , a few daughters . No doubt those few were a great comfort to their own men , and a great temptation to the others . Hezro smiled gently , remembering another girl and boy who had known love in the wadies for half a summer . For half a summer they had played together in this wilderness . They had loved moderately , as befits the young who have not known the gnawing of unfed hunger . Then Nabal came to buy the girl with his gold and his goats .. Abigail had wept and stormed . Nabal had already divorced three wives because they failed to give him children . Nabal was an old man , a glutton and a drunkard . But nothing could change the stubborn avarice of Abigail 's father . Well , thought Hezro , stirring angrily against his boulder , I am comfortably married and my fourth child will be born before harvest . I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose girl sleeps in the wadi , wrapped in his cloak . Hezro rose and stared down at the sheep . He wished one of them would be silly enough to stray from the green bit of oasis into the hills so he  | would have to bestir himself to fetch it back . But the sheep fed quietly , or stood in foolish content while their lambs butted and suckled and cavorted against them . Hezro sighed , and sank into the lengthening shadow and pulled his headcloth over his eyes . He wished he could forget Abigail 's tender eyes and the full , deep curve of her lower lip . He had watched while the years robbed her of the radiance which had enthralled him on summer afternoons long ago . Abigail was possessed by a sour-faced old curd who had not even sap enough in his vitals to give her a child on whom she could spend her wealth of tenderness . Now Hezro 's mind went to a thing he hated above all things to contemplate . There had been the harvest festival last autumn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house . Hezro was nearby at the moment when Abigail first caught sight of the red-haired young man . What a figure he was , with his athlete 's shoulders and his warm , intelligent blue eyes ! How Abigail had fluttered that day , while Nabal grew drunk and drowsy . Nabal must have seen , as Hezro saw , how the radiance rose again in Abigail 's dark , tender eyes . Too bad , thought Hezro restlessly , that so promising a young fellow must fall under the displeasure of the vindictive sheik . Too bad Abigail must love again and lose again , must live once more through all that agony . Hezro wished restlessly that he could forget the sun-browned face and bemused eyes of the boy in the wadi this morning , wished he could forget how Abigail had delighted him on those longago afternoons . No matter how good the wife a man marries , he never utterly forgets that first delight . Hezro opened his eyes , disturbed by the racket made by rocks rolling downhill . The priest was emerging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glanced suspiciously at Hezro , and Hezro sighed to think of the energy the gaunt young man was wasting on anxiety and suspicion . Who cared what the fellow did in that cave he had adopted for his own ? And yet , thought Hezro , with a pang he could not banish utterly , if I had not lost Abigail , I might have been one of the eager ones instead of the drowsy creature I have become . He sighed and rolled over on his face in the shade of the boulder . A lizard scuttled from under a rock near his hand , and he watched it rush away to disappear in the roots of a stunted acacia . Then he closed his eyes and slept . 6 ABIATHAR CLIMBED THE wadi while the wind whipped his skirts about his sweating shanks . His head ached and his lips were dry and feverish and  | one of his nails had been broken to the quick in handling the rocks with which he had covered the linen- and mud-wrapped scroll he had buried in the cave . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind drove him faster , up the steep sandy wash . Today David had marched with his men against Nabal 's household , as Saul 's soldiers had marched against Abiathar 's family on an unforgettable afternoon . David had set out for Carmel without consulting Abiathar , without inquiring of the Lord by means of the sacred dice which Abiathar had risked his life to recover from the murdered body of his father at Nob . That is the worst of giving yourself to another man 's cause , thought Abiathar bitterly . Gratitude is something David will never feel toward me . He remembered how , on the day of the massacre , he had crawled back at dusk to take from around his father 's neck the pouch containing the Urim and the Thummim , those two blue stones with which , for Israel 's leaders from Aaron 's time until now , the high priest had inquired of the Lord concerning Israel 's affairs . The leather thong from which the pouch hung had worn a groove in the skin of his neck , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or night . Well then , it was not for gratitude that he served David . David was both strong and weak , both wise and foolish . But David had been anointed by Samuel . He was one of the great ones , possibly even the one for whom Israel waited , the one who would make her strong and secure in her hills , a nation to be reckoned with . For David 's sake , thought Abiathar , my father , my uncles , my brothers all died . He recalled with a writhing of the spirit the monstrous destruction at Nob . Abiathar had ceased to grieve for his family . But more than men had died that day . Soldiers of Saul , drunk with destruction , had burned the scroll which Abiathar had been reading on that blood-red afternoon , the Book of the Wars of the Lord . Men are born to die , but those who destroy scrolls destroy wisdom learned through the struggles of uncounted lives . Abiathar had huddled in the cistern , armpit-deep in the cold water , waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slaughter to rescue the scroll . He had managed to save a few charred fragments of parchment ; with them he had gone with horror and shrinking to the body of his father , the high priest , and had taken from hs neck the pouch which contained the sacred dice , and hung it upon his own neck . Then he had fled south to find David . From that day till now , Abiathar had been writing from memory the stories he had read in the Book of the Wars of the Lord , that the heroes of the Lord might continue to live , today and tomorrow and for a thousand years after that . The thought of the great ones of old , Moses and Aaron and Eleazar , and all the nameless scribes who had not troubled to  | sign their laborious works  --  histories , allegories , poetry and law  --  brought tears to his eyes . A rich burden of meaning lives in the written word ; the past and present mingle when living men know again what was in the minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortals , set apart to write down words on skins . This was the driving destiny which nobody understood . Not even David knew of these scraps of painfully garnered parchment which he filled with tales he had read , songs sung by the priests , and new songs which David sang by night at the campfire . Not even David knew with what painful care Abiathar had dredged up from his memory the tales of Samson , who had fought the Philistines ? of Deborah and Barak , who fought the Canaanites  --  of Gideon , who led a coalition of northern tribes against a federation of nations from beyond the Jordan . With these tales Abiathar also wrote the stories of Samuel , of Saul , of their wars against the Philistines , and of David , the latest hero to rise among the people and the first man of Judah among all the heroes . Someday , thought Abiathar , with the exalted sense which came now and then that he knew the mind of the Lord , Israel will be one people , ruled by one king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring them round . It will no longer be left to this tribe or that to fight each alone his local foe . Someday Israel will be one people , and one leader will rule all the tribes , and when that time comes , Jerusalem will cease to be an enemy fortress dividing Judah from the northern tribes . In such a time , Jerusalem will be a dwelling for Israel 's rulers . The sacred writings will then be gathered together and made safe in the strongest and most beautiful city in the land . It had been Abiathar 's faith that David might be such a leader . Because of this faith , Abiathar had comforted himself after the massacre at Nob . But if now David began shedding the blood of his fellow tribesmen , how could he ever again lead Judah , let alone Israel ? Abiathar plucked at the skirts which stuck to his legs . He raised his face and gazed about dazedly . What am I doing here ? he wondered . Why have I climbed this mountain when there is so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving the wadi , heading north . There was a boy newly come to camp , a kinsman of David . I will ask him to tell me about David 's years in Bethlehem , thought Abiathar . I will add this to my records , for David is as great a hero as Samson or Gideon , if he never again fights a battle for Israel . David is a hero , anointed of the Lord , and I am sent to he his conscience , his priest , his historian . To this end was I born , and to this end was I spared when my family died at Nob . Somewhere in the hills rose the peal of a girl 's full-throated laughter . Abiathar sat down suddenly in the shadow of a rock and rubbed his cheeks with the torn tail of his cloak . I am going mad , he thought . Even in the hills I hear her laughter .  | I am a man to whom nothing is small , he reflected . The desires of the spirit and the desires of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love of David and the love of the written word are great within me , but no greater than this hunger I have for a girl to sleep beside me in my tent . How many times had his flesh melted at the thought of possessing the tall girl with the straight brown thighs and the supple , curving back ? How many times had he watched her mending his cloak or baking his cakes , and felt himself utterly consumed with longing to possess her and dwell with her ? The laughter came again , and he thought , It is the beginning of madness , when her laughter follows me through the hills . Now he remembered the thing which had slipped from his mind when he reached the mountain top . He had intended to search the peak for the newest shrine set up by Uriah the Hittite and his uncircumcised horde . Abiathar meant to find and destroy the shrine before the next full moon ? the day the pagans called Shabbatum . " Let them alone , " David had urged . " They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their high places . " David was not driven by the zeal which would not let Abiathar rest . Still , David would not be the leader he was if there were no zealots dedicated to serving him . Yet more than zeal drove Abiathar in the will to destroy the local shrine before the next full moon . He remembered a day before the last rains when Benaiah had derided him because he never went with the young men of Israel to dance with the Canaanites . " Come with us , " Benaiah had urged , and had laughed and told Abiathar upon which hilltop the revels would be held . " You 'll shrivel to a cinder if you do n't do something to break the monotony . Come along , man . You 'll serve the Lord better tomorrow for having a bit of fun tonight . " Abiathar spoke to David that day , knowing his own weakness and the hunger of the flesh and the senses . He asked for Reba to be given to him as his wife . But David was evasive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl for himself . The priest lay in his tent that night , tormented , longing to renounce the things of the spirit and satisfy the hunger of the flesh , longing to go and dance before Baal , make himself naked with those others , find among the pagan women one who would not care that he bore in his flesh the seal of circumcision , and so loose himself from the mandates and prohibitions of Moses . The night ended at last . When morning came Abiathar spoke to David of how men of Israel joined with Uriah 's men in observing the Shabbatum . " How can we ask men who live as we do to forego the pleasures of the high places ? " David asked . His face was ravaged by discouragement .  | Abiathar asked , " How can I inquire of the Lord for you in a camp where men worship the Baalim ? " David sighed . " Do not ask me to punish my men more than they are punished already . As for Uriah and his Hittites and Jebusites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they love me but because they hate Saul , and the Edomites and Philistines .

" Abiathar said stubbornly , " If they follow David they ought to worship the God of David . They waste enough vigor in these carnal revels to win twenty battles . " " Do what you think best , " David said at last . " They do not bring their Baalim into camp . They do not raid our people . They fight only on my orders . More than that I can not ask of them . But you are our priest . Do what you think best . " Abiathar went into the hills that day , and found the high place last used by the men , and overturned the Masebah and chopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . But other full moons had come and gone , and the men cleansed their shrine and set up their sacred stone again and Abiathar knew he could not contend with them , since he was one and they were many . And he bore the rigors of chastity with patience , knowing his hunger increased his zeal for David and for the writings which he wrapped in linen and packed with mud and buried in a cave in the wilderness . The laughter came again , very close , and suddenly Abiathar saw that the laughter was not a fiction invented in his tired mind . Beyond the rock beside which he had fallen he saw two figures running . A girl and a boy were chasing one another from shadow to shadow in a childish game of tag . Their laughter rang across the hills as if they were alone in some Eden all their own . Abiathar 's eyes filled with the ready tears of a man sick with exhaustion and longing . The tears were for the happiness and childish simplicity he saw in those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes with this young cousin of David . How good it was that there were two of them so young , to enjoy the fragment of childhood which remained before they took on the mantle of maturity . Reba had been too much with anxious and desperate adults . She had missed the joy which is a part of youth . To play in the wilderness as lambs play in the pasture , forgetting danger and privation  --  to be lighthearted for no reason except it is spring and the sun shines  --  this belongs to youth , and the boy had brought this to Reba . He watched her elude the reaching grasp of the boy , pivot lightly and  | dart toward his rock . He saw the smile light up her face when she recognized him . She ran to Abiathar , jumped into the shadow in which he sat and cried , " I 'm out of breath , Joab . Enough is enough . " Abiathar passed his hands over his face , rubbing away the haze that came so often before his eyes . Reba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as if you had forgotten to sleep and eat , and had come too far in the sun today . " Abiathar said to the boy , " You are David 's cousin ? " He liked his face . Joab 's eyes turned continually to Reba , and the priest knew that here was someone who would not think of the girl in the lewd way of those men who went to romp in the high places with the pagans . He ought to love her , thought Abiathar . He ought to marry her , when they are a little older . But he will never marry her . David will never give her to anyone , for David is keeping her for himself . Abiathar rose , conscious of the ache in his head . " Joab , " he said , " I meant to seek you out today , and ask you to relate a few tales of David 's youth in Bethlehem . " Joab pulled his eyes away from the bright face of the girl . " Why ? " he asked politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep with the records of Samson and Gideon and others . Heroes have come ? " Abiathar paused , listening . From the clearing came a noise of laughter and shouting , mingled with the braying of donkeys . " David has returned , " he cried , and set out at a run toward the bluff overlooking the camp . Joab cried , " David has returned . " All this day he had forgotten David and David 's fearful errand to Carmel , and had thought only-of this girl who could transform his every mood and motion into tenderness . Joab seized Reba 's hand and they raced together after the gaunt-faced , burningeyed priest . From the bluff they stared down at the long queue of laden donkeys and men . The late afternoon sun glimmered on fruits and hampers and wineskins , and on sweating , laughing faces . " There has been no massacre , " whispered Abiathar . He raised his face to the hot blue sky . " David has forsworn his oath . He has accepted bounty . He has not shed Judah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I feel the hot breath of the Lord upon my cheek . " Joab stared at the priest , amazed by such an outpouring of emotion , pleased that the priest had looked on today 's affair as he had himself . From the clearing someone shouted , " Abigail brought us bounty ! Look at the gifts ! " Joab laughed aloud . " It is the hot breath of an amorous woman you feel upon your cheek , Abiathar , " he cried , with all the authority of one  | experienced in the ways of amorous women . " David was saved by his own blue eyes and his curling red beard . " Abiathar turned dazed , reproachful eyes on him , but Joab did not notice . He was running , nimbly as a young goat , down the path which hugged the face of the bluff , and Reba was right behind him . Love , Joab was thinking , is the greatest force in the world , for love can conquer all else . What wisdom was this which had come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days , yet he had learned many things . I am a man , he thought . Wisdom belongs to a man . He leaped the last ten feet and turned to catch Reba in his arms . But she shook her head and darted around him . Above them on the bluff Abiathar still stood , his face and arms raised to heaven , his lips moving silently . 7 JOAB WAS KEPT busy in the days that followed . He helped tally and distribute the bounty Abigail had sent . This involved trips with donkey trains to the companies stationed at En Gedi and Adullam . When that was finished , Abiathar kept Joab talking of David for three endless days . Not once did Joab speak privately to Reba . He saw her often at the campfires . But after he returned from the donkey trips her dark eyes no longer smiled on him . By the end of the first day with Abiathar she deliberately turned her back when he caught her eye . He finally escaped Abiathar at the end of the third day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scowling face of Benaiah . The bandage was gone from his head , but a new wound had appeared , a deep slit in one ear . Benaiah was talking urgently to Reba . Joab ran to the tent but Reba was already closing the curtains . Benaiah turned a darkly mottled glare on Joab and strode away . Joab lingered , speaking through the curtains , urging Reba to come out for only a moment . " I have n't had a chance to speak to you , " he said . " But I thought of you constantly . " She must know how much he had thought of her , these lonely , busy days . She must know what a confusion of longing and happiness and remembered joy suffused all his thoughts . " You were n't afraid of me that other day , " he pleaded . " Why are you afraid of me now ? " " Why did you stay away ? " Reba 's voice was low and close , as if she were pressing her face against the curtain which separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from you ? " " You could have come . You could have managed . A man can come and go . A girl can do nothing but stay in her tent and wait . "  | Joab was scandalized . " Do you think I am one of the lewd fellows who crawl under the curtains of a woman 's tent in the night ? I am a grandson of Jesse ! I am David 's kinsman . And David is your protector . " A hand was laid on Joab 's shoulder and he was spun round to face David . David 's face was flushed and angry . " This is the last thing I would expect of you , cousin , " David said . " To come peeping and whispering at the curtain of a young girl 's tent ! What kind of man do you call yourself ? " Joab stood speechless with mortification . The curtain of the tent was lifted . Reba stepped between them . " David , do n't be angry with Joab . He came because  --  because ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I want her to be my wife . Give her to me , David . I will take care of her . Somehow ! " David 's anger vanished . He smiled the affectionate smile Joab knew so well . " You are impetuous , cousin . You have been with us ten days , and you are ready to make twenty men your enemy by marrying our little Reba . " He ran the back of his closed fist gently along the soft fuzz of beard on Joab 's jaw . " Let 's not be hasty . We will discuss the matter again when you are a man . After a year or so . " David 's eyes crinkled in laughter . Reba pleaded , " I want to marry him , David . I want to go to Bethlehem with him , and live with Zeruiah . I have thought about it , and I have made up my mind . " " Would you like to go to Bethlehem without him ? Suppose he does not choose to go to Bethlehem just now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , I will go . " David 's amusement was gone . " Forget this childishness , " he said curtly . " I 'll hear no more of it . Close your tent , Reba . Joab , I have an errand for you . Ira will tell you the details . As my kinsman you will represent me at Carmel tomorrow . " David strode away . Reba had already vanished behind the black curtain of her tent . Joab stood , miserable and irresolute . From the tent came a whisper of longing . " Take me to Bethlehem , Joab . Now . Tonight . I 'm ? afraid of what will happen if I stay longer in this place . " " No . " Joab spoke the one word abruptly , ashamed of his helplessness to do the one thing Reba asked of him . He walked away fast , but not fast enough to leave behind the shame which possessed him . He had caught a glimpse of the poverty of Reba 's tent . He remembered the thinness of her tunic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give her nothing . The crooked figure of Lem seemed to dance ahead of him in the shadows . If I could take her to Bethlehem , he thought , I could give her everything she needs . A dream of the rambling house in Bethlehem , a dream of sharing it all with Reba , of being able to supply all her needs , burdened his spirit . Lem , he thought , how gladly I would have spent my life with you  | in the pastures , if you could be alive now and I free to take Reba home to Bethlehem . Next day Joab marched with Ira and eight others to Carmel . Their errand was with Nabal . " Make it clear to him we accept no more bounty at second hand , " David said . " Get his promise , in the presence of witnesses , that there will be no more insults . If he is drunk , wait until he is sober and speak with him then . Tell him we will not wait until harvest to learn whether he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ira had plenty to talk about as they trudged the forest path north to Carmel , but Joab was not listening . He was too deep in his own despair to think of anything else . I am responsible for Reba , he thought . He had never before in his seventeen years been responsible in this way . He had been a good son to his mother , obeying her orders with intelligence and discretion . He had been a good shepherd , following a pattern of action in which he had been instructed by the sons of Jesse . Life is simple for an obedient , capable boy . Except for trouble with Lem and the occasional bullying of Seth , he had faced no serious problems . But now David refused his request that Reba be given to him . David 's word was law in the stronghold . Joab was helpless . And it was not pleasant to be helpless when you were a grandson of Jesse , patriarch of Bethlehem . At the edge of the village Ira halted their little expedition . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk with him . We are not to compel him . Joab and I will go to Nabal . The rest of you go round by the camel gate and wait in the courtyard among the servants until I send for you . If you hear any talk about how it went when Nabal learned that Abigail sent bounty to us , do not close your ears . " The village of Carmel was a collection of circular huts built of mud bricks and plaster . The huts clustered around the imposing stone-and-brick dwelling of Nabal and Abigail . Nabal 's shepherds and servants lived in the huts . As Joab , with the squadron of men , passed through the unpaved street of the town he noticed that the houses seemed deserted . From somewhere came a sound as of many voices lamenting . The nearer they came to the house of Nabal , the louder the wailing became . " Somebody has died , " Ira remarked . " And it is not a shepherd or a servant . The whole town is lamenting in Nabal 's courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said indifferently . The death of an illtempered old man seemed of small importance to Joab that day . The house of Nabal presented a solid wall to the street . Joab noticed complacently that the masons who built this house had cut the stones less evenly and fitted them with a greater waste of plaster than had those who built the house of Jesse . Small slits under the projecting roof served as windows . A single barred door was set in the wall . The eight young men  | followed the wall around to find the camel gate at the back , but Ira knocked loudly on the street door with the handle of his sword . " How fortunate , " he remarked , " that a kinsman of David is here . We have come , mind you , to offer condolences in a time of bereavement . Let us hope it is Nabal and not the lady Abigail whose death is the cause of all that caterwauling . I am a brave man , friend Joab , but ? " Ira was interrupted by the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maid . The customs which govern mourning are practical , Joab reflected , as he observed the correctly disheveled appearance of the girl . With a rent cloak hanging loosely from her graceful shoulders , with ashes to mar the curly dark hair , with her face streaked by tears and soot , she gave every evidence of having suffered a great loss . That she had held her own in the lamentations was apparent from the hoarseness of her voice , Ira said kindly , " We come from David , my girl . This is a time of distress in the household of Nabal ? " He paused , waiting for more information before committing himself further . " Alas for my master , " the girl said hoarsely but with composure . " The light of his smile will gladden our hearts no more . Please come in . " They entered the reception room beside the passageway . Ira said , " This is Joab of Bethlehem , a kinsman of David . He speaks for David . " He paused politely , waiting for Joab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had not been instructed . Joab cleared his throat . " We bring a message to your mistress , my girl . " " She is prostrate . However  --  since you come from David  --  I have no doubt that she will receive you . " The girl glided from the room . Her hips rocked gently , setting the tattered cloak to swinging . " The light of his smile , ' " mused Joab , who had an ear for a neat phrase . " I like the expression . " " If you had known Nabal you would like it even better . That girl has imagination . " Ira smiled , as if contemplating the girl 's pleasing qualities . " I am free to say , " he continued , " that I shrank from encountering Nabal today . If I add my voice to the volume of hubbub in the courtyard yonder before we depart , it is testimony to good manners , not to grief . " " This girl  --  you know her ? " Joab studied Ira speculatively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are surely many who have known it . The wilderness invites lovers as it invites outlaws . " I know her only by reputation . Her name is Dinah . When you see her with her face washed and her curly hair combed , you will understand why she carries herself with so much  --  uh  --  charm . Abigail has surrounded herself with a remarkably attractive collection of serving maids . " " She has ? " " Aye . Hezro 's opinion is that she hoped to distract her husband . But  | Nabal never took a concubine . Abigail bore the brunt of his devotion alone . " Joab glanced around the room with curiosity . The floor was liberally covered with thick rugs of the kind which come from beyond the Euphrates , rather than the cheaper rugs made by the Amalekites of the southern desert . On a low chest along one wall stood a single ornamental urn . Obviously the urn held oil to which spikenard had been added , for the delicate fragrance filled the room . The reception room at home had fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more handsomely carved , and her three urns were smaller but of a better color than Abigail 's single one . Moreover , Zeruiah had caused a pair of carved cedar benches to be set in her reception hall , while here the guests , if they sat at all , would sit upon the rugs . Carmel was near to Hebron , where caravans passed bringing objects from the whole earth ; but though Bethlehem was only an hour 's brisk walk from Jerusalem , Zeruiah could never bring herself to barter with the Jebusites in the city of the uncircumcised . A shelf which projected at shoulder height held an alabaster lamp with seven mouths which must have come from Egypt . I should like to buy such a lamp for Zeruiah , he thought , and swallowed , for thoughts of Zeruiah brought loneliness . So far he had done absolutely nothing which could serve to bring nearer the time when he could return to Bethlehem . The scrape of sandals on stone came from the passageway . The woman who entered was small and delicately made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of determination and purpose . Her clothing was not rent , nor was she disfigured with ashes or any other signs of mourning . Her cloak was of fine quality , made of linen which had surely been dyed by the merchants of Tyre . Her mantle was scarlet , and decorated with a rich pattern of golden embroidery . I wish I could give such a mantle to Reba , thought Joab with longing . He was surprised , but not displeased , to see Abigail so richly dressed , in view of the fact that the entire village was in her courtyard mourning the death of her husband . Abigail 's eyes were clear and serene . Her mouth , Joab thought , was her best feature . The lower lip was full , with deep indentations at the corners . Abigail is a woman of beauty as well as purpose , he thought . She calculates her moves . She knows she will gain nothing by disfiguring herself in mourning , and so she sensibly leaves that to the servants , who are paid good money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his firm grip on reality in Abigail . I like her , he thought . I would like to know her well and call her my friend . Abigail bowed and motioned for them to seat themselves , sinking gracefully upon one of the rugs herself as she did so . " You have come from my  | lord David ? " Her voice vibrated on the name , as if she could not speak it without emotion . " David is my mother 's brother , " Joab said . " He sends sympathy in your hour of bereavement . " " My lord David is gracious . You may take this word to him : The Lord who watches over my lord David has seen the behavior of that worthless man who was my husband , and has smitten him for the insult he offered to my lord David . " Concealing his surprise , Joab inclined his head . " I will tell my cousin what you have said . " " Tell my lord David also that all I have is his , if he will receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , flocks , vineyards , orchards , and pastures . My servants are the servants of my lord David , and I am his handmaid . " Her eyes held Joab 's , awaiting his assurance that her generous offer would not be refused . Joab smiled warmly . " I will tell David what you have said . And I will bring you his answer . " He added impulsively , because he liked Abigail 's directness , " You are gracious far beyond the merits of my cousin , my lady Abigail . " Abigail clapped her hands together , and Dinah appeared . " Bring refreshments for these guests , " Abigail said . While he tasted the rich cakes of dates and figs and almonds , and the fine red wine which Dinah brought , Joab was thinking that if Abigail and David were married , Abigail would befriend Reba . She could do for Reba the things Joab could not do . He could bide his time until David was willing to grant his request , if Reba were provided for . Joab felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pass , and the months , and there would be many days when he was not occupied with errands for David . The courtesies were concluded , and Dinah went to tell the eight young men in the courtyard where to meet Ira and Joab for the return . Joab found himself outside the house once more , walking through the village with Ira . " The lady , " Ira mused , " wishes to buy herself a husband who plays the lyre and makes poetry and has a curling red beard . " Joab smiled . He was feeling extremely pleased with the turn events had taken . " David 's luck is beyond belief . If I had not heard the lady 's words myself , I would find this development incredible . David will be lord of this wilderness , the richest sheik south of Hebron . " He felt a gust of warm wind blow past his face , as they left the village behind . How suddenly David 's affairs had shifted from desperation to security , even comfort ! I feel the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a stab  | of superstitious fear . Is it the God of David who brought it about ? Or is it chance which turns the tide of David 's affairs so unexpectedly ? Ira said , " With flocks and orchards Nabal bought Abigail , so Hezro told me . And now it seems the lady will use the same coin to buy David . In the end Nabal was swindled , or so it seems to me . Without meaning disloyalty to David , I venture to predict that Abigail will also be swindled . " " You forget yourself , " Joab said sharply . " I forget nothing , my inexperienced young friend . It is no slander to your celebrated kinsman to say that David will never love the lady Abigail as she loves him . He never loved Saul 's daughter Michal as she loved him . He will never belong to a woman , though many women will belong to David before he is finished with living . Abigail will never rule David , or David 's household , as she ruled Nabal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourn for her lands and her flocks , and she will know that she has been swindled . " In the edge of the forest the young men were waiting . They fell into line behind Joab and Ira , heading south together toward the stronghold . One of them , a Reubenite named Obed , told of the manner of Nabal 's death . " How lucky , " said Obed , " that we did not destroy Nabal when we marched against Carmel ten days ago . He is dead with no help from us . David is avenged , yet we have not shed Judah 's blood . Nabal was smitten by the Lord , " he concluded , rolling his eyes piously heavenward . Ira said , " Aye . Nabal 's follies included drunkenness and gluttony . The Lord often smites drunkards and gluttons suddenly . " Obed smiled . " It was suggested in Carmel that the Lord had some help from the lady Abigail in the smiting of Nabal . " " Watch what you say ! " Joab said sharply . Obed laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his servants , telling him how David came to kill him and all his household , and only her presence of mind in getting together a generous gift of bounty saved his life . Abigail railed at Nabal , while his servants sat about smiling behind their hands . And Nabal fell down in a fit and was carried to his own chamber . He lay there for days , tended only by Abigail . Not even Dinah was allowed in the room . Presently Nabal was dead . And it is said that when he died Abigail washed her face and put on fine raiment and came from his room as one who rejoices . " Ira said quietly , " We will listen to no more scandal , Obed . If Abigail hated Nabal , so did we all . If she loved David , well , so do we . It takes a woman of courage to act without pretense or hypocrisy . Abigail is our friend and Nabal was our enemy . We will not forget it . " Obed 's voice was smooth and pleasant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friend and hate your enemy . That is the beginning and the end of  | virtue . Still , you asked me to keep my ears open . I only repeated what I heard . " Joab served as friend of the bridegroom in bringing Abigail to the stronghold after her seven days of mourning were accomplished and Nabal had been laid in the tomb of his fathers . Joab led Abigail to David in the wedding ceremony , laid her hand in David 's hand . Abiathar blessed their union . To the camp Abigail had brought a long train of donkeys laden with provisions , with tents and rugs and woolens , wine and fruit . Many sheep were driven to the clearing for slaughter and all the camp rejoiced at the wedding feast . 8 THE MARRIAGE CHANGED the complexion of the stronghold . Prosperity came with Abigail , as well as the pleasant sight of half a dozen pretty serving maids who moved from springs to tents to campfires , neat and useful and friendly . Many men now sent for their wives and little ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that his company of one hundred men was constantly employed as muleteers , porters , messengers . Joab came to know the wilderness thoroughly that summer , though he had known its northern extremities all his life . He wore out many pairs of sandals marching up and down the wadies and across the rocky hills at the head of a donkey train . It would be hard to find another land where such contrasts existed . The wilderness fell away from the green , watered mountains of central Judah down to the deep Arabah which embraced the Dead Sea . The sea received drainage from the hills on three sides and from the Jordan River on the north . The sea receives all and gives up nothing , Joab sometimes reflected . Yet that was not altogether true , for the sea gave up moisture into the thirsty desert air , and the moisture formed cumulus clouds which hovered always above it . The wilderness was dotted with oases , where springs rose in the rocky earth to water a small area before losing their moisture in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand and rock . The largest of these oases was En Gedi , which lay , green and fertile , close against the mineral-rich waters of the Dead Sea . Here lived an entire company of David 's men . These were men who had raised crops and tended orchards and vineyards before their exile from home , men who still preferred farming to fighting . At En Gedi there were date palms and  | sycamore figs , vineyards and gardens and grain fields . A herd of Abigail 's goats grazed on the rugged hills above . Near the end of summer , Joab led a dozen donkeys with their drivers up a wadi from En Gedi toward the stronghold . Laden with melons and dates and summer fruits , the donkeys rebelled against the ascent over the yielding sand . The muleteers alternately cursed and prodded the beasts . They sang songs and told ribald stories about Abigail 's maid Dinah . Joab took no part in their singing or their talk . He had grown increasingly silent during the summer , brooding on his own affairs . Ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , danced the image of Reba . Abigail had taken a liking to her . She gave the girl clothing as colorful as her own , a cloak of dyed wool , a blue mantle decorated with white needlework , a scarlet girdle with ends which hung to her hem , bracelets that jangled , and a heavy neckband of silver . Abigail spent many hours teaching Reba to do needlework . Still , Reba continually plotted ways to escape and be with Joab on the hills . Joab knew with shame that if Reba did not arrange these meetings there would be few of them , for he had no skill at all in clandestine arrangements . More and more , as summer passed , their time together was spent quarreling . When Joab went to her tent at night he was angry because of the need to go wriggling under the curtains , in fear that he would be seen and denounced . Joab did not know whether he was more afraid of David 's anger or of the men 's ribald laughter . He knew with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen the title Despoiler of Women . Yet the secrecy angered him less than Reba 's perpetual plea , " Take me to Bethlehem . " He had never told Reba why he could not take her to Bethlehem . Nobody here except David had been told about Lem . In a camp where so many men were outlaws it was not the custom to speak of the past . Joab told himself angrily that Reba ought to know without being told that a reason existed why he could not go to Bethlehem . Anger helped him endure the fear he felt that if Reba knew the truth she would no longer love him . How many times , when she spoke of Zeruiah , had the thought come , It is not a husband you want but a mother ! Once he spoke the accusing words , and Reba wept , and he comforted her . Thereafter he did not speak the words , but the thought came to torment him , and only anger could ease the pain of his self-doubt and his own hunger to go to Zeruiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twice he had gone to David to ask that Reba be given to him . Somehow , he did not understand how , the conversation shifted to more urgent topics , and then almost at once David had other matters to attend to . The next time he found David alone he spoke of something he had long had on his mind  --  a plan he had for taking Jerusalem in a single night . He  | asked David to let him come before the council and present his plan fully . But David had only laughed and clapped him affectionately on the shoulder . " You want to tell my men how to fight ? You want to be a hero , eh ? " Joab protested , growing incoherent with humiliation as David continued to laugh at him . When he ceased to attempt to explain or defend himself David grew serious . " You have never fought in even a minor engagement . Yet you want to tell my men and me how to conduct a battle . You seriously suggest that I take my few hundred half-armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saul 's thousands have their headquarters and there lay siege to a city that not even Abner with all his ambition would attempt ! Do you understand how many of my men are deserters from Saul 's army ? Do you know how many are in hiding from an avenger ? Are you yourself so willing to go marching past Bethlehem ? Think what you are suggesting ! Think , and listen , and learn ! " Joab did not again attempt to speak privately with David on any matter . His love and admiration for David were all they had ever been . He was convinced that David with his six hundred ragged outlaws could withstand Abner with his thousands . But he knew he would have to solve his own problems and must not go again to David for help . And the months of summer passed , and the land grew brown and sere and Joab spent his days as a leader of donkey trains . Reba accepted everything Abigail offered except for giving up her ragged tent to move into one of Abigail 's . Reba declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had left to her . And Joab knew she made this sacrifice in order to remain alone in a place to which he could occasionally come . Now Joab let his mind dwell upon the last time he had been with her . He felt in memory the twisting of her fingers in the downy fuzz along his jaw . " I want you to be my wife , " he told her , voicing the desperate longing which kept step with him on the long marches . " I want to know every day that when I return home you will be waiting in a tent which is our own . I want everyone in this place to know you 're mine . " She had moved restlessly , turning her face from his kiss . " The nights will be cold when autumn comes . I do n't want to go through another rainy winter in this clearing . " " I 'll talk to David again , " he promised , knowing it would do no good . " Do n't talk to David . Take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't ask David again . We do n't need his consent . We 'll be married by the elders in Bethlehem . " " Forget Bethlehem , " he said roughly . " I 'm here to serve David . " She began to cry , saying that he did n't love her . He became exasperated and struck her , and went back to Ira 's tent .  | He clenched his fist now , remembering in his palm the arch of her cheekbone where he struck her . The sweat ran down his legs under the thick folds of the girded cloak . Behind him Joab heard the bickering of the men . Most of the springs were dry now that summer was ending , and all the men were hot and thirsty . It made them more quarrelsome than usual . At the moment they were quarreling about the maid Dinah . If Dinah accomplished half what she was credited with , Joab reflected wryly , she would have neither time nor energy left for serving Abigail . A muleteer started the song of David and Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who dance in the streets . Soon all were shouting the song : Saul has slain his thousands And David his ten thousands . David had forbidden the song . Joab had the uneasy feeling that a more forceful leader than he would surely stop the song . But he let the matter be . A rumor was afloat that Saul had set out on another of his marches into the wilderness . The rumor made the men restless , but the song gave them courage . Anything which gave the men courage was good , it seemed to Joab , since it is not easy to hide and wait , a few hundred outlaws , while thousands of trained soldiers march to hunt you down . These men had never yet fought Saul 's army . The maneuver had been to hold back , hide in caves , or disguise themselves as shepherds or women . In a land so riddled with caves it was easy to disappear . Still , now that so many women and children and tents had been added to the companies , concealment grew more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a point where the wadi twisted north . Beyond the next hill they would enter another wadi , one which rose in a hill near camp . Joab was thinking how many times during these past years Saul had led his men into this region , and then turned back because of the failure of his guides , or because of reports that Philistines were raiding the threshing floors of Benjamin or Ephraim . Twice Saul had turned back because David had come near and spoken to him , reproaching him , calling him " My father . " " Saul is swayed by every wind , " Ira said . " And the strongest wind of all is Abner . Abner fears that David will supplant him as commander . Abner invents tales of David 's plots to supplant Jonathan or even Saul himself . He reminds Saul of the tale that David was once anointed by the prophet Samuel . " " That tale is true , " Joab interrupted . " Samuel had received hospitality from Jesse and ? " Ira brushed it aside . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives kindness . Maybe the anointing meant much . Maybe it meant little .  | But Abner tells the story as if it were part of a subtle plot against Saul himself . Abner will never give up while David lives . " At the east portal of the stronghold , where a single sentry had drowsily watched their departure for En Gedi the day before , a troop of men from Uriah 's company , Hittites , Jebusites , Perizzites , Girgashites , Amorites and Canaanites , were stationed . Their leader halted the donkey train . He patted the hampers and poked among the fruits in an officious , offensive way which irritated Joab . The muleteers grumbled over the delay . They were impatient to get to the storage tent , unload their burdens , turn their donkeys into the fenced valley , and get to their tents and their women and their food and wine . " You know us , " Joab protested . " What 's all the fuss about ? " " Orders , " the man replied self-importantly . Another man came forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile of Uriah . " Saul has passed Hebron , friend Joab , " Uriah said . " He is camped nearby . Your brother Seth came today with the news . One of Nabal 's shepherds has taken pay from Saul to guide him to our stronghold . " Uriah raised his voice to be heard above the uproar among the muleteers . " David and Seth have gone to reconnoiter . We have orders to guard this point . " Uriah 's man said , " Pass , friend . " Joab hustled his men and donkeys forward through the thinning trees into the clearing and across it to the tent Ira used for storing supplies . This tent was not far from David 's council fire . Fifteen or more men sat about the fire , talking earnestly . Among them was a newcomer , one whose heavy beard , rapid gestures and urgent , loud voice made sweat break out on Joab 's face and body , chilling him . Elhanan was here ! David had admitted Elhanan into this camp ! Joab had been in haste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . But now he did not wait to speak even to Ira . Keeping the tents between himself and the fire , he dodged into the shadows and back the way he had come . In his arms he held melons he had taken up in haste to complete the unloading . He clutched the melons and ran through the trees , tripping over underbrush and fallen . branches but plunging on in blind flight . Joab turned north when he was free of the trees . He climbed the ridges and descended swiftly into ravines . Off to the right he could see the glimmering sea by moonlight . Above him in the sky the moon lay , a crescent of silver , rocking on its back . The stars were bright . He ran on , keeping free of the forest . He ran until the breath sucked in his throat . At last he tumbled , panting , into a wadi . The law of Moses was specific . If the avenger came up with him outside a city of refuge , he was to kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elhanan found him there , Elhanan would have to take him before the elders in the gate and bring charges , and the judges would hear Joab 's defense . If they found Joab guilty of murder they would hand him over to Elhanan for execution . If they found him guilty only of accidental killing or of killing in self-defense , they would sentence him to serve a term of years within the city walls . Joab thought of the years ahead in Hebron , the very best he could hope for , and he felt like laying his head upon his knees and lifting up his voice in a wail . Then he remembered that Lem had been dead for a whole summer . Elhanan had waited until now , had given Joab this summer with David and his men , a summer with comrades , a summer to become the friend of Ira and Abiathar , of Benaiah and Uriah . He had had a summer to know and love Reba . If he died tomorrow , or if he lived a decade in Hebron , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him by waiting until now to pursue him . Yet he could not forget that David had loved him so little that he had let Elhanan enter the camp , not knowing whether Joab would escape to Hebron or be killed . I do not understand David , he thought with some bitterness . Even now , with Saul 's army at hand , surely David should have driven Elhanan away . He needs the strength of men more than of boys , thought Joab , crushed under the burden of familiar self-doubt . Yet I am his cousin . Surely he owes me something . I will not think of it any more , he thought . And he laid his palms against the earth and said good-by to this wilderness . He would spend the days and nights of the future inside the mouldering walls of Hebron . Joab took his knife and split open the melons he had carried and ate them , refreshing himself and ridding himself of their burden . Rising , he stood for a while listening . There was danger in these hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly on the encamped army of Saul . There must be no more of this panicky running . Joab girded his cloak and climbed out of the ravine . As he neared the top of the ridge he heard voices on the hill beyond . Two figures rose against the sky . Saul 's sentries , he thought , and dropped silently behind a thombush . While he watched , the figures came into full view , silhouetted against the bright sky . One of the men seemed a giant . The other was smaller , with a familiar grace and compactness . David and Seth ! Joab 's first thought was to leap up and shout at them . Then , bitterly bewildered , he remembered that David had permitted Elhanan to enter the camp . He remembered the scorn he had received from David more than once during the summer . He flattened himself behind the thombush and remained silent . David made a trumpet of his hands . " Abner ! " he shouted in a voice  | that filled the night , the mighty voice of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army of Saul was camped nearby . David alone was challenging the army of Saul ! David shouted again , " Abner ! Are you afraid to answer me ? " A distant voice called , " Who is it that shouts at the army of the king ? " David shouted , " What a brave man you are , Abner ! While you guarded your king , I entered your camp and stood over him . I could have killed him . I have his spear and cruse , which were beside him . You , Abner ! Is this the way you guard the king of Israel ? " On the hill Seth held aloft a spear and water bottle . Joab no longer huddled on the ground . He was on his knees , listening . Abner had stirred up Saul against David . But tonight David had put Abner to shame in the presence of the king and all his army . An uproar had risen in the far valley . Above the uproar rose another voice , trained also to be heard in battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It is David , my father . Why do you want to destroy me ? Who am I that your army pursues me through the hills ? Do the king 's armies hunt partridges in the wilderness ? Is it for sport that the soldiers of Israel serve their king ? " The clamor died in the valley . Only the voice of Saul was heard , humble , old , tired . " I have played the fool and have erred exceedingly . Return , my son . I will never forget that you spared me when you could have killed me . " A trap ! Joab held his breath , waiting to learn whether David would be deceived . Return , my son ! Return within our reach so we may destroy you by stealth when you are no longer on your guard against us ! David 's voice was as sad as that of Saul . " I leave the spear and bottle here . When I am gone , Abner can send a soldier to fetch them . " The defeated voice of Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , David , my son . " Long after David and Seth had gone away south over the hills , long after a soldier had come and carried off the spear and bottle , Joab lay on the earth , under the moon . Long after the camp in the far valley grew silent , Joab lay among the rocks and shrubs on his hill . He stared up at the moon , pondering the wisdom and destiny of David . All the half-formed impressions of childhood , all the tales that came to Bethlehem from Saul 's capital , all the love and awe he had felt through the years of his youth came back to him , and he thought of David as of a star . Tonight , he thought , I have seen the greatness of David . Tonight I have seen his wisdom . God of David , Joab whispered against the earth behind his thornbush . Lord God of David . He did not know whether he prayed or whether he  | cursed . David alone had routed Saul and his thousands . David had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet , and in Saul 's , and had struck an unforgettable blow . Suddenly , Joab was sobbing . Earlier tonight he had said good-by to the hills and the earth and the life he had known . Now he was sobbing because he had seen against the sky the naked sword of David 's wisdom . He sobbed because years must pass before he would be again with the girl he loved , and all because David , with all his wisdom , cared not the turn of a hand for his seventeen-year-old kinsman . He is like the sea , thought Joab , not for the first time . He draws us all into himself . He gives back nothing . And Joab rose and set out toward Hebron , skirting the camp of Saul . I am quit of my vow to the God of David , he thought . Yet the thought brought no comfort . For he had never loved David more than he loved him now in the hour of his rejection . 9 IN THE DAYS that followed David 's routing of Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroidering of the tale . In his own ragged tent , Abiathar wrote the story in neat , careful letters on fresh parchment , together with other stories of other wars . When the parchment was full of his writings he wrapped it in linen and packed it with mud , and carried it to the cave above the oasis where Hezro often grazed his sheep . It was not the first story he had written down of how Saul marched into the wilderness and then marched out again without lifting a hand against David . Abiathar was writing many tales these days ; ever since Abigail 's coming he had had an abundance of skins . He spent tedious hours scraping and pounding and rubbing the skins . He spent other hours searching beside the sea for reeds to make into pens , and mixing lamp-black with sheep 's gall to use for ink . The abundance of work for his hands comforted Abiathar , so that the lust he had felt for Reba during the spring and summer no longer troubled him . Her face came between him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the autumn Reba had taken on an air of tragic womanliness . Abiathar had seen the baffled anger on Benaiah 's face as he watched Reba dreaming by the campfire . He saw the change which came over her after Saul 's army came and went , and Joab disappeared . He grieved because Reba grieved and there was no one to comfort her . Then he turned again to his parchments . In Abigail 's tents the tale of David 's newest exploit was rehearsed admiringly by the maids . Yet , now that David called Abigail less often to  | his tent , she could no longer bring to the maids the firsthand news of David 's affairs which had made up so large a part of their talk . Instead , the maids brought tales at second hand , rumors which floated through the camp . Perhaps it was because Abigail had lived too long with Nabal , or perhaps because she realized how small her influence was with David , that she was finding much to criticize in the stronghold . She talked of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmel . She also spoke of Joab , who when he heard that Saul was nearby , fled in the night , back to his mother and safety . " I liked that boy , " she said . " He was sensible and reliable and I would have said he was brave . I am sorry to learn that he is a coward . " Reba endured these conversations in silence . If she wept , it was at night in her tent . But she spent fewer hours now with Abigail , and more hours brooding alone . How often she had begged Joab to take her to Bethlehem , yet when he fled there , he abandoned her . She grew thin and listless . Her dark eyes grew large and the bones of her face were sharp . Reba 's thin , brooding face sent Benaiah shouting to David three times during the weeks of autumn . If Reba would not consent to marry him , Benaiah shouted , let her be given to him anyway . He would soon bring her to her senses . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other women are . Who ever heard of a woman giving consent to her own marriage ? If you waited for that , half the women would never be wives . Abigail heard it all . She saw the opaque curtain settle over David 's face and knew too well why David seldom called her to his tent . An evening came when she went uninvited to David . She stood in his presence , well wrapped in her scarlet mantle . " I am troubled for my maid Dinah , " she told him . " She comes and goes freely about the camp , as if she were a man . Tent life is no life for my maids . Dinah speaks to them about how they all can marry men of property and go to live in towns . Before we know it , I 'll be without maids to help me make this wilderness life bearable . Will you speak to her , David ? " David looked long into the troubled eyes of his wife Abigail , then nodded . " Send her to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to David 's tent that night , and she became his concubine . So it was Dinah who brought news concerning David 's affairs in the following weeks . When a slender , finely-dressed young man with a silky brown beard and burning , bitter eyes came to camp , guided by one of Abigail 's shepherds , Dinah told the women that the stranger was Saul 's son Jonathan . The shepherd who brought him was the man who had been Saul 's guide . Benaiah had taken the shepherd outside the camp , and had returned alone after a little while , whetting on his palm the newly polished blade of his knife .  | Why had Jonathan come ? Dinah did not know . In her opinion , Jonathan had come to reinforce Saul 's invitation to David to join the armies of Israel in a march against the Philistines . Another maid , Judith by name , had it from her friend Obed the Reubenite that Jonathan had come to spy out David 's strength for Saul . " Benaiah will attend to Jonathan also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported . " Nonsense , " Abigail said sharply . " David trusts Jonathan . It was Jonathan who first warned David of Abner 's plot against him . I do not think he came to urge David to return , and I am certain he did not come as a spy . " Still the rumor persisted that Jonathan had brought an offer of amnesty for all David 's men and of Abner 's post for David himself if they would join Saul 's army . Among all the rumors one undeniable fact was known . Ever since Abiathar had brought the Urim and Thummim to David , Saul had been without any means whereby to inquire of the Lord for guidance . Dinah heard Jonathan speak of this to David . When Saul sent his troops to Nob to destroy the priests he did not remember to warn them to bring the Urim and the Thummim to him . " Saul thinks the stones were lost , " Dinah told the maids and Abigail . " He does not know David has them . " Then all the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter so portentous . " A man called Zadok is Saul 's high priest , " Dinah said . " But without the Urim and Thummim his advice is not to be relied upon . Saul goes to consult with witches and mediums and soothsayers . Afterward he kills them , either because they foretold disaster or conversely because they foretold good fortune which did not materialize . Saul is despondent , and Abner makes most of the decisions . " Dinah 's eyes were bright and the tale she had heard from Jonathan 's own mouth gave the women material for many happy hours of gossip . On another morning Dinah reported that the king of Gath had sent a messenger to David to offer a treaty of mutual assistance . Achish , the Philistine king , would give David a city on the border of Judah if David would come with all his men to live there and protect Achish from his enemies in the southern desert . Ziklag was the city , a good city with strong walls and houses of brick and stone . Abigail was delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We would be able to protect Judah as well as Gath . We could prevent Philistine raids on Judah and strengthen our friendship with the elders in Hebron . Then Achish , protected by David in the south , could push his wars against Saul . Meanwhile , David would war on the Amalekites , who are far richer than Edomites since they raid the caravan route that connects Damascus  | with Egypt . They are rich in slaves and camels and blankets and tents . David could grow rich fighting Amalekites . Oh , if only David would listen to me ? " Then Abigail glanced about at the faces of her maids and grew silent . But Reba , horrified at all this talk of moving down to live among Philistines , ran from Abigail 's tent to the accompaniment of her own jangling bracelets . That night Reba saw the Philistine messenger beside the fire with the men of David 's council . The door of her tent faced the fire , and she sat on the thick , warm rug Abigail had given her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan the son of Saul , and Ittai the Philistine . She watched them and shivered , and when at last she closed her tent and slept , she dreamed of her childhood and of Philistine raiders who had killed her mother and destroyed her home . Next day Reba went to find Abiathar . He was not in the camp , but she waited beside his tent . He came , after an hour , carrying a bundle of the reeds which he sharpened to make pens . Her hands plucked restlessly at the silver band she wore at her neck , while Abiathar told her which of the rumors she had heard were true , which false . Jonathan had come to warn David that he must leave Judah . Abner would not rest while David remained within his reach . " David has sent to En Gedi to bring the captains here for the final council , " Abiathar told her . His dark eyes avoided hers , and his hands trembled as he worked with his knife , spoiling two reeds for every one he perfected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ziklag and serve Achish . But he must persuade all his captains and all his men . The league with Achish depends on the size of the forces he brings . Nothing short of the full six companies David commands will satisfy the terms of the league Achish has offered . " That night Reba watched again from her tent the men who sat in this last council in the wilderness . The sight of them held her spellbound . Reba had learned that you can live without warmth , without comfort , without those you love . But to see the men who had been her father 's comrades turn now to make a league with the enemy that had killed him was a death of the spirit . David , Ira , Benaiah , Abiathar , Uriah , Seth and his friend Elhanan of Bethlehem , the captains from En Gedi  --  all were there . All were bidding farewell to hope , honor , courage . Or so it seemed to Reba . Now at last Reba could believe the worst of Joab . If these men could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting Philistines was forfeited in a cause not lost but abandoned . If men could do this , a boy could abandon a girl who loved him , fleeing from a battle that was never  | fought . There is , in the end , no courage , no faith , no truth in the men of Judah . Reba sat in her tent while the fire burned low . The men talked on , sometimes disputing hotly , sometimes listening to long harangues from one man or another . A long silence fell , followed by a word flung into the silence like the sharp yelp of a dog . Then the argument was resumed . David spoke seldom . His head drooped . When he raised his face he looked as a man looks who is under sentence and will soon be turned over to the avenger . One by one the men rose and left the fire . Defeat was in the set of their heads , the slant of their shoulders . Finally only David and Jonathan were left . They talked quietly together beside the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shut out the sight of the fire which was dying , and of men whose spirit , whose courage was dead . If Joab had not abandoned her  --  there was Zeruiah , a mother who was afraid of nothing on this earth . But Joab had abandoned her and had not returned , though three months had passed . There was nobody to whom she could turn . Even Abigail , lost in her own disappointment and loneliness , had shut herself off from friendly confidences . I am alone , thought Reba . I am all alone . She raised her face from her knees . David stood in the open door of her tent . " My dearest girl , " he said in a voice which shook with strange tenderness , " you have not closed your tent . It is long past dark . You know better than to be careless about this matter . " He stooped to enter the tent . He sat on the rug Abigail had given her , and took her hand and laid it against his cheek . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove ? " " You are going to join the Philistines . You will fight their battles and spend the lives of your men to enrich them . " " Dear Reba , you have more reason than any of us to hate the Philistines . Tell me what I ought to do . " " Would you listen to me ? " What nonsense was this ? David did not seek advice from a young girl ! Reba knew quite well that the decision had been made in full council , and no matter what she said , she could not change that decision . David said gently , " I will listen . In the end , the responsibility is mine , and the decision will be made by me . But I want to know your thoughts . " His arm went round her . She rested her head against his shoulder . The touch of his cheek on her hair comforted her . Some of the bleak loneliness ebbed in the comfort of David 's affection and concern . She said , " Joab used to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With your six companies you could hold Jerusalem against Saul forever  | until finally he would be forced to make a treaty with you . Joab says you could march from here in a night , and be inside the city before dawn . Joab says the Jebusites have no plan for defending their city because they trust in their walls , as Goliath trusted in his armor and his sword . Joab says ? " David 's arm had dropped away . His voice was suddenly harsh . " Joab is a dreamer of fantasies . How would we feed ourselves in a city of Jebusites where not one of us owns an inch of ground ? I have never believed in Joab 's dream of taking the city so easily , and if I did believe it could be done , I could not feed my men if Abner came to besiege me . " Reba sighed . " Well then , stay here in the wilderness . Abner will not live forever . A Philistine arrow will reach him soon . " David sighed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown too large to live on the frugal bounty of the wilderness . The Edomites have long ago yielded up all we can hope to take from them . Besides , the women are sick of camp . They cry for a city , for houses , for protection from the coming rains . Jonathan warns me that Abner will soon march again if I stay within his reach . I must leave Judah . " Reba moved closer to him , feeling the bitter sadness of his mood , longing to comfort him , longing to be comforted as well . When his arm went round her again she felt the trembling of his body and thought how deep his grief must be . She said softly , " David , you could make a league with the Moabites . They have received your father and brothers . Surely they would receive you . " " The Moabites are at peace with Saul . They could not remain at peace if they received me . There is only one king who will receive me , and Achish is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " David 's head drooped until it rested on Reba 's breast . She cradled his head in her arms , longing to comfort him , forgetting her own grief in the longing to comfort David . He said , " If only I could go to Moab . Or stay here in Maon . But I can not . I can never fight against Abner . Three times I have stood over Saul . Three times I could have killed him . But my hand refused . I can not fight Saul and I can not fight Israel . I have nowhere to turn . Why has it come to this ? I obeyed orders and served Saul and Abner with all my might . Why am I brought to these straits where every man 's hand is against me ? " Reba cradled his head , comforting him . " How can I answer ? " she said softly . " I only know we all love you , all of us , your people . We trust you and look to you . You are the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been abandoned . I have loved you since I was a baby . You 'll find the right way . You have been desperate before . " David kissed the face that was so close above his , then rose , and Reba  | stood beside him . He said , " There is no way out for me . We are too many for this country , for we can neither hide here nor be fed . " His arm closed round her , pulling her to him , and she rested her head on his shoulder , proud that he had turned to her for comfort . This was the first time she had ever been of service to David , who had been her protector for so long . To be of help to one you love , one who is lonely and despairing , she thought , that is how a woman finds comfort in her own distress . " I wish I were wiser , " she said . " I wish I could really help you , David . " David 's lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are so lovely , so young . You grow sweeter in this wild place , as if sweetness began and ended in yourself . Your father would have been proud to see how you have blossomed in this wilderness . " His arms were so close about her now she could not breathe . His hand moved down her back , pressing her against himself . " You said that you love me , " he whispered . " I have waited for your love . You can comfort me indeed , my darling . Only you can comfort me tonight . " Reba stood rigid and dumb with the shock of David 's meaning . He loosened the fastenings of the tent curtain and let it drop . He said , " You were wrong to leave your tent open tonight . " He knotted the curtains securely fast and in the darkness his arms found her , his hands found the knot in her girdle . She pulled away from his touch . " Do n't be afraid of love , " David pleaded . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to give love and to be loved . Did you think I would let you go unprotected among Philistines ? You will go as the wife of David . You will be safe . " She whispered faintly , " David , you have been my protector . Protect me now . " " Now and always , " David replied , and pulled her rigid body to the mat . After an endless time , when the cool air of dawn could be felt , David said , " I am glad you love me , Reba . I am glad you are finished at last with the nonsense about my young cousin . I knew you would forget him if I got him out of the way . That is why I brought the avenger to the camp . I knew he would flee to Hebron for a time . I did it for you , my darling . " " You brought the avenger ? Joab  --  fled from the avenger ? " David 's voice was the voice of one who speaks of trivial matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joab was in danger of the avenger . Joab might have been killed . " Her throat was tight with anguish . " No , no . There was no avenger , except in Joab 's guilty mind . My sister concealed his crime . When Joab has suffered a little for killing the other  | shepherd , we will tell him all about it , Seth and I. Meanwhile , he shall sweat a little , so he will be in no hurry to kill again . " When at last David left her , she lay face down on the mat , exhausted , unmoving . David , she thought , you are too much for us , for all of us . We all serve you , David , she thought . And when you are finished with us , we wait until you need us again . Abigail , Abiathar , poor Joab . Even the lusty Dinah . And now me . I will be the wife of David . The third wife of David . First Michal , Saul 's daughter . Then Abigail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , other wives , other concubines . David 's first two wives brought him power , position , wealth . I bring you a gift also , David , thought Reba . A gift you do not yet know about . A child . David 's first-born child . I hope he will be a son . I alone will know he is not David 's son . That will be my secret  --  and my strength . David , she thought , I do not hate you . I do not hate anyone . I was a fool to choose as protector a boy who could not protect even himself . Reba rubbed the place on her neck where the memory of the pressure of David 's crisp beard lingered . She wanted to blot out that touch from flesh which had felt the downy beard of a boy . She turned her face to the earth and wept for herself , for Joab , for her son , who would come into the world as the first born of the mighty David , but with no heritage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought sadly . Is it true , David , that you give back nothing ? I0 Joss REACHED HEBRON before dawn . He entered at the broken gate and lay down close by the crumbling wall , drawing his cloak around him . He did not want to sleep . There would be nights aplenty for sleeping inside these walls . Ten minutes before he reached the gate , he had passed the cave of Machpelah , which Abraham had bought from the Hittites a thousand years ago as a tomb for Sarah , his wife . He thought of Abraham , and of Hebron , which had been a thriving city when Abraham migrated here from Syria . Abraham had pitched his tents outside the gate and had grazed his flocks on the abundant grass of the slopes both east and west . His nephew Lot had taken his wife and his flocks across a wilderness greener then than now , and had settled at Sodom , at the southern end of the Dead Sea . But the cities beside the sea had been blotted out by overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salt which had been flung up to mark their passing .  | Joab thought of the many years Abraham and Sarah lived together . He thought of the meaning of race and family , and how its roots are in the strength of a man and the tenderness of a woman , and in the delight they have in one another . I could live with Reba , he thought , as Abraham lived with Sarah , and love her no less after many years . He pictured himself standing with Reba before the elders of Bethlehem to receive a blessing on their marriage . He wondered how it would be after ten years , or twenty , or fifty , to know always that the place which is home to you is home also to the girl you chose in the exuberant vigor of your youth . Joab knew that morning that nothing would ever reach more deeply into the core of his being than the love he felt for Reba , the longing to share with her his home in Bethlehem . Men live and die , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife together is eternal , binding together families , generations , races . At dawn Joab rose and found a spring where he could wash himself . Then he walked about , following the winding streets of the city . Hebron was the metropolis of Judah , and in a sense the capital city of the tribe . Joab had heard Jesse speak of it as the oldest city in Canaan , possibly the oldest city in the world , though one could not be sure in comparing Hebron with Damascus or the cities of Egypt . Protected by its hills , fed by the fertility of its valleys and slopes , watered by a score of springs and two score wells , it was ideally situated as a dwelling for peaceful men . For men of war , the Jebusite city was better , being on a hilltop and easier to defend . But for men of peace Hebron lacked nothing . When invaders came , therefore , the people of Hebron did not resist . They adopted new ways and did business with the invaders . The valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watered that vineyards and olive orchards abounded , testimony to the bounty of nature and the industry of men . The streets wound among low , gray stone buildings which hugged the contours of the eastern slope . The walls were crumbling , wholly gone in places where the terrain served to indicate the boundaries . Accustomed to open fields , Joab was oppressed by the narrow alleys reeking with the strange odors of wares brought from Egypt and Nineveh and Phoenicia . He had laid his plans during the night . He would not go to the elders himself . Nothing can be gained by going to meet trouble . He would find employment and wait for trouble to find him . He was hungry and had no resources but his two hands , his young strength . He had no intention of seeking out friends of Jesse in this town to make known to them his disgrace . So he followed the narrow streets until he came to the market . There was in the market a booth where men could go who wanted to sell their labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking  | for workers in vineyards and orchards beyond the walls , but he could not take the chance of being found in such a place by Elhanan . Men were wanted to go with camel caravans to Beersheba and on through the Negeb to Egypt , and Joab toyed with the thought that he could see the world if he joined a caravan . Then he remembered Zeruiah and Reba , and knew he must not delay any longer but must be here when Elhanan came , stand trial , and get the whole thing settled . The only employment he was able to find that suited his circumstances was with a wine merchant named Aziel . Aziel 's vineyards , like the rest , were above the city on the hill . But below the vineyards lay a stone trough , Aziel 's winepress , and below that lay the vats where the wine was aged . Aziel not only made wine , he bought and sold it . He had shops in the bazaars of a dozen towns of Judah , from Beersheba north to Gibeah . Aziel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elder in Hebron . Aziel thought only fools would waste their time on civic duties when they could be using it to make money instead . When Aziel hired Joab he set him to treading grapes . He promised to give the boy more responsible and less tedious work after grape harvest ended . Yet Joab did not put much faith in Aziel 's promises . He saw how Aziel measured him up and down , and was sure Aziel recognized the nature of Joab 's sojourn in the city , and meant to enrich himself out of Joab 's need . The wage he offered was a pittance , but food and lodging within the walls went with it , and Joab was in no position to barter . Employment as a treader of grapes is no better than slavery . Even for a boy of Joab 's strength the work was exhausting , as well as monotonous and humiliating . The food provided him was a slave 's food , a dark , illbaked kind of bread with sour wine and occasionally lentils . He was given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing with him but the tunic and cloak on his back , nor was anything given him . So he slept on the dank straw he found in the shed , wrapped in his cloak . After the first day he could not wash the stain of the grapes from his feet . He walked through the city with the skirts of his unwashed cloak flapping in the dust , unwilling to gird them up and make a show of the purple toes thrust between the cords of his sandals . The purple stain became his badge of slavery . And the days went by , and Elhanan did not come to Hebron . Grape harvest ended and the labor at the stone vat was finished at last . The vat was scoured and covered for another year . All this while Aziel refused to pay Joab the scant wage he had promised . " When I return from Egypt , " he would say . Or , " When the men of Beersheba pay what they owe me , " or , " When I have paid off the muleteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that he would never be paid , because Aziel had no intention of giving a strong , intelligent , dependable boy money to lodge elsewhere .  | At last Joab was given work with some dignity to it . He was set to tending the wine booth . " I will double your wages if you can show a profit , " Aziel promised generously . But Joab reflected gloomily that double the wages he had had from Aziel so far would still be no wages at all . Tending a wine booth in the bazaar is lazy work , with plenty of time for observing the merchants , the sheiks , the slaves , the veiled women , the priests , and those who , like himself , were refugees in Hebron . Aziel came now and then to spend an hour in the shop . Aziel had discerned from Joab 's manner that he was interested in David . Joab had no doubt Aziel had figured out long ago that he had taken refuge in the wilderness with David for a while before coming to the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's courage and wisdom , and predicting a dazzling future for Judah 's hero . " When Saul is dead , " Aziel said , " David will be welcomed in Hebron as first man of Judah . We 'll give him a fine house . We 'll make him our judge and protector  --  our king . We 'd do it today , but if we did Saul would come marching to Hebron , and this city is certainly not adapted to wars . But you wait and see , young fellow . See if David is n't king of Judah , once Saul is dead . We men of Judah have no use for Benjamite kings , or for any other kings stemming from those northern tribes . We art : a tribe apart , and we 'll rule ourselves hereafter . But not while Saul lives . " There was little to do in the long days in the sunny bazaar , except listen to the merchants in nearby booths , watch the women as they bargained for provisions , and stare at the green hills above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would manage when the rainy season came , how long Elhanan would wait before coming here to find him . Toward the end of an afternoon in late autumn , the shadow of a man fell across the stone pavement of the booth . The shadow was broad , and the voice which shouted at him was familiar . " Wine , " shouted Seth . " Wine , boy , if you please ! Much wine for a wedding . Step lively ! " Joab pushed back the headcloth that shaded his eyes and blinked up into the bearded face of his brother . He leaped to his feet with joy . Then he turned away , remembering . Seth exclaimed , " Well , if it is n't my vanished brother ! I 've come to fetch you , boy . " He stepped forward to embrace Joab , but Joab turned his back . " I suppose you brought Elhanan ? " " Elhanan ? Not I. I 'm not Elhanan 's keeper . " " You are nobody 's keeper . Mine least of all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Joab shrank back into the shadows of his booth , but Seth did not notice the heads , or if he did he enjoyed the stares of the city dwellers . Seth shouted , " I have come to buy wine for David 's wedding . But I have also come to bring you back to camp , for David insists he must  | have you to serve as friend of the bridegroom . So here I am in all friendship , and you reproach me with Elhanan . Boy , will you ever learn what it is to have a brother who sees to your interests ? " " Do n't add lies to your other sins , " Joab muttered . " And in the name of God , lower your voice . " Seth dropped his voice , but the broad smile did not leave his face . " We have known for three months that you were here , and for two months that you were in the employ of that shrewd fellow , Aziel . Now the time has come to fetch you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once before as friend of the bridegroom , and he is more in need of good fortune now than ever before . " " David knows I can not come . You know it too . " ' " You can go wherever you like , Joab . You are free as any man . " Joab stared at Seth 's broad face , unbelieving . Seth said softly , " Our mother told me a tale when I was last in Bethlehem . It is a tale you may enjoy , younger brother . It seems you had a friend in the pastures , a half-wit named Lem . Well , it seems that on the night you took it into your head to forsake your duty and run off to play outlaw with David , an accident befell this poor lad . He was torn by beasts and died . " Joab stood open-mouthed while Seth continued , " Our mother was herself obliged to go to the fold , because you had abandoned the sheep . She took young Asa with her . They found the mangled body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenged Lem 's death by killing the bear . He took the head of the bear , and went to fetch Elhanan , and all Bethlehem praised Asa for his courage in avenging the death of the hunchback . " Joab sank to the earth , overcome by the reversal in his fortunes . And Seth roared , " Now will you shut that idiotic mouth of yours and bring me wine ? I swear , you look as half-witted as ever Lem looked in his lifetime . " Joab turned his back . If Seth saw the tears on his face he would never stop ridiculing him . He mumbled , " I will sell you all the wine you want . " He began laughing . His laughter swelled , filling the bazaar , but Joab no longer cared how many of these hustling Hebronites stared at him . " I will not sell the wine . I will give it . Wine to celebrate my freedom . Wine for David of Judah . May he have a hundred wives , and may each enrich him as did Abigail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Bring up your donkeys and we will empty the shop . " Joab was laughing to cover his tears . He was laughing because , beyond all banter , Seth took an interest in him and had come to Hebron to bring him back to freedom . Neither David nor Seth had betrayed him in permitting Elhanan to come to camp ; only his own fears had betrayed him . Before night fell he would be in camp . He would see Reba . He would  | see Abiathar and Ira . He would have food to fill his belly after three months of slave diet , food provided as a wedding feast for David and his new bride . He bundled the wineskins onto the donkeys , bundled the bottles into the hampers , laid two of the largest skins over his own shoulders . In a few days now he would take Reba to Bethlehem , and she would be his wife in the presence of Zeruiah and the elders . " We will leave word for my master in the next booth , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal , he can not object that the booth is untended . Aziel is a scoundrel , but he loves David . We will leave word that he has donated this wine for David 's wedding celebration . We will leave word that David will not hold it against Aziel that he made a slave of David 's cousin , and cheated him of his wages . And now tell me , what is the name of David 's bride ? " II JOAB STOOD AT the door of Reba 's ragged tent . The curtain had been tied back and Reba was veiled and ready . This was the first time Joab had seen her veiled , though he had seen many other women so covered . The veil she wore was of white linen , brought from Bethlehem . Zeruiah had kept it in a chest in the stone house for use by brides of the sons of Jesse . Seth had brought it here . The veil hung from Reba 's head , covering her completely , held in graceful folds by the white linen girdle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a handsome silver chaplet on her head , touched the folds of linen here and there , and stepped back . Zeruiah had sent all the garments Reba wore today , as her gift to a bride who came to David without dowry . The sight of Reba clothed in bridal garments sent by his mother sent waves of anguish through Joab 's body , so that he trembled and clutched at a tent pole to still the tremors . Dinah murmured , " Happiness , Reba , and many sons . " The words were formal , but the tone held hostility . Abigail 's faction would naturally feel hostility toward a wife taken by David before either Abigail or Dinah was with child . Joab extended an arm stiffly . " Come . David is waiting . " Dinah took Reba 's hand and laid it on Joab 's . She held the curtain aside while Joab led Reba from the tent . The customary procession of virgins following the bride had been omitted . Reba wanted it this way , since she had lived without friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joab walked alone from her tent  | toward the council fire where David and Abiathar and the men of David 's council waited . Joab spoke softly , choosing formal phrases as befitted their formal attire but finding in the formal words an outlet for his heartache ; " On a day in early summer I came to this place . I was welcomed by a girl of tender beauty . I was fed with cakes of her making . When she followed me to the hills she welcomed me in other ways , so that I loved her and would have shared my whole life with her . Now I repay her kindness . As cousin and friend of the bridegroom , I welcome her into the family of Jesse of Bethlehem . I bring her to my cousin David , the most distinguished of us . David says that she is shy as a young hind . I never found her shy . I found her one who gives love bountifully . I ask now that she receive my kinsman as generously as she used to receive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ever I find her playing the harlot or causing my cousin anxiety through the jealousy of any man , I will plunge a knife into her heart . " The last words were spoken through set teeth . From the veiled figure came words softly spoken . " David has always been too much for us , Joab . We can not help what has happened . But we must not hate each other . " Joab gripped her hand so hard he heard the sharp intake of her breath . He quickened their slow pace . Reba stumbled , unable to see the footing because of the white veil . But Joab gripped her hand , pulled her along . Now they were with the others . While the men of the council looked on from the firelight , and all the men and women of the camp crowded into the nearby shadows to watch , Joab laid Reba 's hand in David 's . Abiathar stood waiting . His gaunt face was pale , and his eyes seemed sunk deep into his head . He raised his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord bless you and keep you . May the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you . May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace . " The benediction of Moses was fresh and new to Joab whenever he heard it . Yet to hear it spoken now for David and Reba turned his heart to stone and caused his face to grow rigid in an . effort to conceal his anguish . He watched while David led Reba away to his own tent . David did not return to join the feast , as is the custom of bridegrooms , but followed Reba into his tent and the curtain fell , closing them in together . Joab turned his back upon the tent . He moved stiffly , almost blindly , bumped against Benaiah , and they snarled at one another . Joab saw that Benaiah 's dark face was suffused with much wine drinking and a length of smudged linen was wrapped around his left arm . Benaiah shrugged and spread his hands . " Come , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feast had been spread . Game , sheep , and oxen  | had been roasted . Shops in Cannel , in Ziph , in Tekoa , in all the villages of the region had been emptied to provide for the celebration . From En Gedi David 's men had come to eat and drink , and this night marked the end of their living in the wilderness . Tomorrow they would march , six hundred men plus women and children and beasts of burden , over the hills and down to the green Philistine plain . The clearing was crowded and noisy . Joab ate and drank with the men but shared none of their mood of celebration . He kept beside him a skin of wine , and drank from it between each mouthful of meat . Beside him Benaiah also had a skin of wine which he offered to share with no one . Joab had made only a little progress with his wine when Dinah bent gracefully above him . " My mistress sent me , " she said , " to bring you to her tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutching his skin of wine . He ignored the laughter which rose after him . He found Abigail in the public room of her tent , seated on a rug . Her face was swollen from weeping . She looked as if she had not slept for many days . Joab sat cross-legged on the rug facing her and extended the wineskin . " Here is wine from the vats of Aziel of Hebron , " he told her . " It is good wine , well fermented . " Abigail took a silver cup which Dinah brought and Joab poured wine into it . She dismissed Dinah and drained the cup , then took a second cupful and said , " I received Reba as if she were a sister . I brought her to my tent and taught her needlework . I urged her to abandon that tattered old tent and share my tent with my maids and me . But she would not . I gave her fine clothes made of dyed stuff , as costly as my own . I gave her bangles and a neckband of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and about Bethlehem , and about the time when I went with Nabal on a caravan to Egypt . I told her all I have seen and all I have been taught , so that she came to know as much about the world we are in as I know myself . I showed her kindness . Now she has stolen the love of my husband . " Joab took a long draught from the wineskin , refusing the cup Abigail offered . " David is still your husband , " he said . " He is more your husband than hers , because you love him . Reba does not love David . " " All women love David . " Joab extended a cupful of wine to her . " You learn to appreciate the goodness of wine when you have labored in making it , " he told her . " The sun and the earth and the mysterious germ of life which is seed  --  all go into it . But without the labor of a man enslaved there is no wine . " And without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no wine . I wonder who will drink the wine of my treading . " Abigail reached for the wineskin and took a draught from it . She did not  | use the silver cup again , but drank as Joab did . " I shall go to Carmel , " she said , " and be mistress of my own household . Why should I live among Philistines ? I do not want to live in a harem . " " Good , " said Joab . " I shall go to Bethlehem and tend my mother 's sheep . I am free , and there is no avenger pursuing me . I can live at peace in Bethlehem , and I need never again be at war with anyone . Why should I live among Philistines when I can live in the house of Jesse and Zeruiah , in Bethlehem ? " Abigail said anxiously , " You must go with David . The treaty with Achish specifies particularly that David must bring all his men to live in Ziklag and defend the southern borders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebron when the treaty was made . I am not hound by it . " Then , emotion filling him , he said , " Reba hates the Philistines . She does not want to live among them . She fears them so much it is a sickness within her . Reba ought not live in a harem . She will never know what it is to be the one beloved wife of her husband , as my mother was to my father , as Ruth was to Boaz , as my grandmother was to Jesse . Already David has taken three wives and a concubine , and he will have many more . That is no life for a girl like Reba . " Abigail patted his shoulder . " I will look after her . I know what it is to marry one man while loving another . I often barred my door against Nabal . Yet I shed no tears when I was Nabal 's wife . Since I married David , since I saw how love for that girl gnawed at him , I have shed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nabal . She has come without dowry . Michal brought him honor and dignity in Saul 's city . I brought him the wealth of the wilderness . But this girl brings nothing to David , not even her love . Because I love him , David will return to me when his hunger for this girl abates . Yet I can not bear to think that David married me only for my goods and my lands and my flocks . " Joab gazed at Abigail earnestly . " David respects your judgment . He listens to your advice . Ask Abiathar how it was with David before he married you . He had lost faith in himself . You restored his belief in his destiny . Ask Ira . Ask Uriah . Ask Benaiah . They know what you have done for David . And David knows . He trusts you and will turn to you when he has  --  has ? " Joab could not go on . He turned his face from Abigail and drank deeply from the wineskin . Abigail said , " I will rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wherever David goes , I will be head of the harem . If he marries twenty wives , I will be senior among them . David will turn to me again . " Joab nodded . He too wanted to believe it . " This greatness of David , " said Abigail . " It is like nothing else we will ever know . David 's greatness comes from the Lord . He is the Lord 's anointed . But it comes also from the labor of men , like the goodness of  | the wine . David will drink the wine which all of us have trod , but he will never know how we labored in the treading . This is not to say he wants to use us , but only that we are at hand . I will go to Ziklag . I will wait until he needs me again . You are his cousin , Joab . You will serve him too . " Joab rose , clutching the limp goatskin bottle . " You are his wife and can not help yourself . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . I will return to Bethlehem and tend my mother 's sheep . And when the Philistines , or Abner , or some other enemy , thrusts a spear into David 's heart , I will walk with the mourners but I will not weep . I will go to his house and take Reba from among his wives and bring her home to Bethlehem . When that is done , I will no longer hate David . " " You do not hate David . " Joab sighed . " Perhaps you are right . Perhaps it is you I hate . David is your husband . Why did n't you stop him ? A woman of your resource could have found a way . " Abigail said sadly , " I tried . I gave him my deepest love . I gave him also my maid Dinah . " " Dinah is a wanton . " " Dinah is a woman who understands men . " " I am a man who does not understand women . " Joab left the tent , and set out up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached the spot where , with his eyes bulging , he had watched Reba drop her cloak on the sand , he scooped out a hollow for himself and lay down in it and wept . So now , he thought , I have given Reba to David . If I served him again , what more would he take from me ? Never again , he vowed , will I go near David . The night wore on , and in the end Joab slept .  | PART TWO The Philistine Plain I2 FLEEING THE COLLAPSE of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete , a tribe of wanderers reached the mainland of Asia to filter gradually around the end of the Great Sea . Passing through the narrow shelf of rocky highland where later the Phoenicians built a maritime empire , they moved south until they reached the richest land to be found between the three rivers and the Nile , the plain which stretched , green and fertile , along the coast from Mount Carmel to the desert . The wanderers brought with them knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Settling in the fertile plain , they turned their backs on the sea and they neglected the fertile soil , which could have yielded grain in abundance . Instead they robbed the orchards and threshing floors of their neighbors ; they made their iron into swords and chariots of war and built a civilization whose name is synonymous with all that is crass and destructive . This people , whose only boast was in their military might , vanished leaving a legend of how their greatest hero died of a stone cast by a shepherd boy . Of the five cities from which kings ruled the people of the fertile Philistine plain , three lay on the coast of the Great Sea . These were Ashkelon , Ashdod , and Gaza . Ekron lay a little inland , on the main caravan route connecting Egypt . with the cities of the fertile crescent . Gath , the most eastern of the five cities , was on no caravan route , beside no sea . Gath was the city nearest to the mountainous Hebrew country , and consequently Gath was the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an autumn evening , in the court of the palace of Achish the king , was spread a feast of mutton and pork , of wine and raisins and dates and melons , of cheese and cakes and olives . At the head of the table Achish was seated cross-legged on a rug . On his right was Ittai , chief of his counselors . Achish rose from his rug , groaning with the stiffness of his joints . He stretched mightily and belched , and stood watching his men relaxed on the profusion of striped Amalekite rugs , wolfing down the meats and bread and fruit , swilling down the wine . They were too busy to notice that Achish  | had risen . Ittai noticed , however , and laid down a succulent knuckle of pork , licked the grease from his fingers , and waved a genial salute . " A splendid feast , my lord Achish , " said Ittai , and reached for a cluster of raisins . Some of the men had finished gorging themselves and had fallen asleep on their rugs , their cloaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their pleasure in his bounty . He wished David had not refused the invitation to share in the feast . Still , a man 's religion was his own , and the religion of David was peculiar , as is the religion of all who do not serve Dagon . David 's religion , however , was stranger than most . Imagine serving a god whose whim it is that his people eat the meat only of animals which chew the cud and have cloven hoofs ! What a lot of good eating a man would miss who served such a god . Still , Achish was not the man to trample on the religion of others , for who could tell in what strange ways strange gods might take their vengeance ? Achish scratched his armpits and wished he could do justice to the feast as these others were doing , without suffering discomfort . I grow fat and lazy , thought Achish . There is no longer pleasure in war or feasting . Even women seem lately to require more exertion than the meager returns warrant . Achish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked ponderously across the stone paving into an adjacent room . He sank , groaning with repletion , onto a padded couch . He ran his hands over the heavy pigskin covering . The leather had grown brittle . I will have thicker padding put on it , and a new and softer covering made , thought Achish , and yawned , and composed himself to sleep . But Achish could not sleep . His belly rumbled and pains shot through his bowels . Turn and twist as he would , he could not be comfortable . I have been idle too long , thought Achish . Now that David protects our borders and conducts our raids , I do nothing but eat and sleep and quarrel with Ittai . I must bestir myself . I must make war again . But the thought of jouncing along the road to war in his great iron chariot made his flesh ache . And he thought , when neither women nor war nor feasting please a man , what is left ? Religion is the pleasure of the old , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale he had heard when very young , of how the god of Israel had been captured in battle and set as a trophy before Dagon . The god itself was a queer thing , as queer as the religion of the people who adored it . The thing was merely a box made of acacia wood , with an overlay of gold carved to show the figures of men with wings . The box held a few relics of stone and wood and sugar , wrapped in crumbling linen , but nothing of any value was in it . The box was set before Dagon  | and left overnight , and next day Dagon was found fallen from his place , with head and hands broken off . No doubt the tale was false , yet the priests of Dagon made it a crime to repeat it , and consequently the tale continued to be told . Somehow since hearing the story Achish had felt a little contemptuous of Dagon . Whenever he went to spread before his god any trophies taken in war , he felt the wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . Well , the box was no longer in Philistia , having long ago been set on an ox cart and sent back into the Hebrew hills . Still , it was a comfort to know that David , who served and adored the box , was the servant of Achish , and had provided the very feast which was rumbling in the king 's belly . Ittai , thought Achish with a smile of secret triumph deep in his beard , Ittai will acknowledge at last that I have utterly vanquished David and have made him my servant forever . All good things bring some discomfort , Achish reflected . This applied to religion and war and the feasts . It applied also to Ittai . Ittai was a pesty fellow , with his extravagant admiration of David and of the scholarly priest who dwelt in David 's city . This priest carried a pair of dice by which to inquire of the god of the box . He had also an incomprehensible penchant for writing things down on parchment and hiding the parchment in caves . Ittai was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hardly rule Gath without Ittai to counsel him and enforce his decisions . Even the throne itself , Ittai had seized for Achish . Years ago this same David of Judah had killed Goliath , a cousin of Achish . When the demoralized Philistine army reached the gates of Gath , Ittai stood in the gate and rallied the army . They made a stand there , and turned back the pursuing Hebrews , and the Hebrews returned to plunder among the dead and to burn the abandoned Philistine camp . But Ittai stood in the gate and declared Achish king , and the people had accepted him . Confound Ittai , he knew Achish was here in the anteroom . Why did n't he come to see whether he was wanted ? Why did n't he come to compliment Achish on the abundance of the feast , and on having subdued David to make him his servant forever ? " Hail " roared Achish . There was no answer except the gusty voices of men who had eaten much and would soon be asleep . Achish fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praises of David . " David was clever enough to see that size and strength could not avail Goliath , providing David got in a crippling blow from a distance , " Ittai had said , when he heard the manner of Goliath 's defeat . " He disabled Goliath before he ever came within reach of that huge sword . " And Ittai had profited by David 's wisdom . He had set up a unit of  | archers in the van of the Philistine army . Thereafter the chariots swept in only after the arrows of the archers had disabled the enemy . In the chariots Ittai had placed javelin throwers to cripple the enemy further before the swordsmen came up . Because Achish had let Ittai have his way in all these matters , there was no other king in the five cities of the plain as rich and powerful today as was Achish of Gath . Of the long quarrel between Saul and David , Ittai had also spoken . Saul marched against David again and again , and returned each time without striking a blow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plans . " David 's political wisdom exceeds even his military brilliance , " Ittai concluded admiringly . Well , a time comes when a man has heard enough of his chief counselor 's praises of another man . Achish sent Ittai as messenger to arrange a league with David . He offered David sanctuary and a walled city . In return , David was to bring the full complement of his six companies to live in the plain , guarding the Philistines from desert enemies and continuing the usual raids on Hebrew threshing floors and orchards at harvest time . The spoils were to be divided between Achish and David . David had lived more than a year in Ziklag , and he had never been niggardly with tribute . The feast today celebrated the second year of harvest raids . He serves me well , thought Achish complacently . And he turned on the couch , groaning . " Ittai , " he shouted . " Come here . " " I am here , my lord Achish . " Ittai leaned lightly against the stone arch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clean , unmarked by grease or gravy , a remarkable feat after a feast . His eyes creased in the familiar , unreadable smile , as if all the thoughts of Ittai were his own , and the words he spoke were measured and sifted . Achish said querulously , " Why must I call ? You saw me leave the table . " Ittai shrugged and spread his hands . His lips smiled within their silken frame of black beard . " I eat slowly , my lord . A bad habit , perhaps , but one which it pleases me to indulge . " Achish brushed aside Ittai 's habits . " We took a wise step in summoning David to Ziklag , yes ? " " A wise step , my lord Achish . " " The credit belongs to you , Ittai . I called you here to express thanks for the way you have handled all our dealings with David . You have served Gath well , in this as in other matters . " Ittai came near the couch and sat on the rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is beyond my merit . " " No doubt . " What ailed the fellow that he was unable to return cornpliments  | to his king ? Old friend , was it ? " You must admit that David serves me well , " said Achish petulantly . " Indeed , my lord , whatever David does , he does well . " Achish groaned . Anger was growing , and with it the unrest in his belly , for anger impeded the working of the juices on the heavy burden of pork and mutton and dates and oil cakes . Achish said loudly , " I tell you , Ittai , David has done for me what he never did for himself . He has raided his tribesmen for me , though he never robbed them while he hid in their hills . At my command he brings grain from their threshing floors and fruit from their orchards . His people abhor him , so that he will be obliged to remain my servant for the rest of his life . Acknowledge it , Ittai . Acknowledge that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among David 's people they have a saying , You shall love your friend and hate your enemy . ' I wonder who is David 's enemy ? Saul ? Or the Philistines ? " " Saul ! Certainly Saul ! He seeks to kill David . We saved David 's life . And David shows his gratitude in these gifts he sends . You come from the feast David sent , and you ask whether he is our enemy ! " Achish was churning with honest exasperation . " I ask whether we are his enemy . There is a difference . My dear fellow , have you the testimony of a single Philistine that the food we have eaten came from Judah ? " The breath rasped in the king 's throat . " What do I need of observers ? I have the wine and oil , the barley and corn , the mutton and pork . Do n't be insolent , friend Ittai . " " I spoke as in the old days . Forgive me , my lord , but tell me this , when did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Achish rose on his elbows . It had become impossible to breathe while lying down . " I ordered David to raid Judah . That is how I know he raided Judah . Many border householders raise swine for the caravan trade . " Ittai shook his head . His eyes were somber , kindly , almost pitying . " The rumor is that David raids only the desert people . Far from raiding Judah , he splits the spoil three ways , one to you , one to the elders of Judah , one for his own people . Rumor says that from the beginning until now , David has made every change of fortune serve his own ambition . Rumor says when David is stronger he will march against Gath , coming up behind us when we go into battle in Ephraim or Benjamin . Rumor says he will destroy us , and then make his peace with Saul . " " Rumor ! " Achish wiped away with his sleeve the spittle which had dribbled onto his chin while Ittai spoke . " Lies , rather . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your feet . You come to me after a heavy meal with lies to destroy me . You  --  you ? "  | Achish would have fallen if Ittai had not caught him . Ittai eased the king 's heavy body back onto the pigskin couch and summoned a servant who brought a basin of water . Then , while he continued speaking , Ittai bathed the king 's face with a damp cloth . " Forgive me , my lord Achish , " said Ittai gently . " It is necessary to speak plainly of David , and to decide what must be done . Daily he grows stronger . Men flock to him , not only from Judah but from the northern tribes as well . Last week a company of Saul 's own archers deserted and marched to Ziklag and placed themselves under David 's command . This must mean that Israel loves David . Israel is not David 's enemy . " Up to now David has refused to teach his men methods of plains warfare . He does not use chariots or camels when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mountain warfare . This surely means that David does not expect to remain in the plain , but will return presently to the hills . " It is said that David takes much spoil from the desert peoples and the farmers of the Negeb , and that the people of Judah grow fat since they no longer fear our raids but are enriched by David 's gifts . I tell you this , my lord Achish . Five years ago David fled alone from Saul , in peril of his life . A year ago he marched to Ziklag , leading six companies . Today he commands twelve companies , with more men coming every month . Soon he will command more men than are in the armies of Gath . The very rivers flow toward David , turning in their courses whenever he moves across the land . " Tears flowed unchecked from the king 's eyes . " David 's god is too great for us . We must get rid of David , as we got rid of the box he adores . We must dispose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " Ittai rose and paced the floor . " You are right , my lord . David serves us , but he also serves himself , and our enemies . Yet it is said that his strength lies in the fact that he has never yet shed the blood of a single Israelite . Because this is true , his god loves him and strengthens him continually . With David it is as it was with Samson , whose strength lay in his uncut hair . Well , we cropped Samson 's hair , and he became weak . We must force David to shed Hebrew blood with his own hand , and he will then lose his power and be as other men . Once his hands have shed Hebrew blood , his god will forsake him , and he will be your servant forever . " " You are my right arm , Ittai , " said Achish gratefully . " Tell me how we are to do this . " " We will make war on Saul . We will gather the armies of the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . They will fight as your own bodyguard , and with your own eyes you will see and know that they fight for us , against Israel . " Peace flowed through Achish . He would sleep now , and rise ready to  | make war or do any great thing which the times demanded of him . " Make the arrangements , " he murmured . " Send messengers to the cities and to David . You are my right hand , Ittai , my good friend , my sword . Make the arrangements . " And Achish sank back on the pigskin couch and closed his eyes . 13 THE WALLS of Gath were old and gray , damp with moss and splotched with patches of newly mortared fieldstone where sections had crumbled away and been repaired . In the shadow of the walls , two armies converged . At the order of Achish , David had marched from Ziklag , bringing every man of his twelve companies . David 's men were camped south of the wall . Now that day had dawned they were covering campfires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bustling and rattling about in preparation for the day 's march to Ekron . There they , with the army of Gath , would join the armies of the other four Philistine cities . The iron chariot of Achish rumbled through the eastern gate soon after dawn . This was the largest and heaviest chariot to be found in the plain . It held , besides Achish himself and the driver , two others , each armed with both javelin and sword . Achish stood vast and gleaming in his brazen armor . Early though it was , sweat was already running down inside the heavy helmet . His shield rested on the floor of the chariot between his great braced legs . His sword hung on his hip . His sleeves were wet with sweat . Achish wished he could forget the whole disagreeable enterprise , leave it to Ittai . Well , Achish comforted himself , this one last time he would march . After this campaign he could safely leave fighting to David and to Ittai , for after this campaign he would have David utterly under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junction of the two armies . Achish inspected the Philistine forces proudly . On his left were the chariots with their drivers and javelin throwers . The helmets of the men , the harness of the horses , and the polished tips of the javelins gleamed in the morning sun . Beyond the chariots , drawn up in close formation , were the bowmen . Great bows and quivers of arrows hung on their backs . Their shields were small and light , attached directly to the body , leaving the arms free for the use of their weapons . On their hips hung the short , sheathed swords which would serve them in hand-to-hand fighting . The swordsmen were chosen for strength of arm and fleetness of foot .  | Their shields were slung over their shoulders during the march , but in battle would be strapped to the left wrist . Achish looked them over with pride in the brightness of their metal , pride in their vigor and aggressive eagerness . These were men who lived fully only in the hour of battle , men who had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill , to pillage . These were the men of Achish , king of Gath . Achish gazed on them proudly while he waited for the messenger he had sent to fetch David of Judah . David had not been summoned to last night 's council of captains . David would receive his orders this morning . David arrived promptly , trotting forward from among his men , quick and eager as though no weight of armor hung upon him . His manner with Achish was respectful . His blue eyes met those of the king of Gath , guileless , submissive . This was a servant it was worth a man 's time to subdue , thought Achish with pleasure . That David was subdued who could doubt ? ? seeing the look of sleepless exhaustion which hovered behind the bright blue of the eyes and the taut lines of his mouth . This was a man , thought Achish with a stir of pity , whose god had chosen him for some high destiny and had then left him to the mercy of Achish . Dagon had defeated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have done so by the end of this campaign . Achish said kindly , " We march together at last , friend David . " No use reminding the young fellow that he was no more than a servant to the men of Gath . His eyes noted the ruddy color under the weathered brown of David 's cheeks and the curling , copper-bright beard . No wonder the women loved this fellow . He was of a remarkably handsome appearance . " You shall be my bodyguard , David , " he said . A clever thought , that had been . He 'd observe the fellow 's every move . There would be no tricks out of David in this campaign . David bowed . " You shall know at last , my lord Achish , what your servant can do in battle . " From somewhere in David 's companies a voice rose , high and clear , shouting a line of song Achish had heard spoken of but had never before heard sung . From nearer at hand a deeper voice answered , singing the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And David his ten thousands . A prickle of fear ran along the king 's nerves . " Your men must not sing that song , seeing it speaks of the slaying of Philistines ! " David smiled ruefully . " I have forbidden the song . But the authority of a leader in exile is not all it ought to be . The men like the song . When they  | march against Saul it gives them courage . However  --  when they know it is displeasing to the king of Gath ? " " If it is heard again , I 'll have the singers dragged from my chariot wheels ! " Achish was shouting , ashamed of his anger but more ashamed of his fear . Before his mind 's eye rose a picture of a ruddy-faced , beardless stripling casting a stone straight and true through the visor of Goliath 's helmet . David smiled . " You can understand that I hate the song as much as anyone , my lord . The song made me an outcast in my own land . " Achish was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . His voice was strong and steady , the voice of command . " Your archers will march and fight with my archers , " said Achish . " Ittai will dispose them . Give me a hundred men skilled with the javelin to include among those who fight in chariots of war . " David nodded . " As you wish , my lord , although my men are not trained to cast the javelin from a moving vehicle . You may find them more useful on foot . " " We 'll use them in chariots as needed , " Achish said shortly . " They can practice throwing from moving chariots when we camp tonight . " David bowed . " As you wish , my lord . " Ittai whirled up in a cloud of dust . " Shall we move , my lord ? The men are waiting . " Achish found himself strangely loth to part from David , restless in the feeling that much lay unsaid between the young captain and himself . " We will meet the others at Ekron , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caravan route . When we reach Dothan we move east through the pass into the Plain of Jezrul . Somewhere beyond Dothan we will encounter Saul . After we defeat Saul we will pass on to the Arabah , cross the Jordan and take the cities of Gilead . " " My compliments , my lord . You Philistines have never before attacked us on so ambitious a scale . " Achish ignored the " us . " " Our spies report that Saul is distraught . He has been deserted by hundreds of his men and also by his god . He turns to witches , but all predict failure and death . We shall win this campaign and henceforth draw tribute from all this land . " David bowed . " I have heard the stories of Saul and the witches . Saul expects to die in this campaign . He is defeated before he marches . Yet he marches , my lord . " Ittai said restlessly , " Shall we go , my lord ? " From the ranks the song rose , moving from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Achish shouted , " If the song is heard again , Hebrews will travel to Ekron chained to my chariot ! " It was an empty threat . Not even brutality yielded Achish pleasure these days .  | " I will stop the song if I can , my lord . " David trotted back to his men , his brazen helmet on his arm , his copper hair gleaming in the sun . West and north to Ekron moved the river of men . At Ekron the river became a tide , flowing north along the plain , out of the Shephelah into the Plain of Sharon , north toward Dothan and the mountains that clustered at the broad base of Mount Carmel . On the right rose the green hills of Canaan . On the left the blue waters of the Great Sea rolled endlessly in white froth against the shore . The earth of this road had echoed for fifty centuries to the rhythmic beat of marching boots , marching sandals , and the tread of strong bare feet . Over it flowed the tide of invasion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hemisphere . Over it now flowed the army of the five cities of Philistia , augmented by David 's twelve companies . As ripples in a pool spread from a stone dropping , so whispers rayed out through the Philistine ranks before and behind and on either side of the marching Hebrews . Now and then , among the archers or among the javelin throwers , a song arose to be quickly hushed . The army reached the narrow Dothan valley , where the road turned east to enter the Jezrul Plain , which pointed like a great , blunt thumb toward the vast ditch of the Arabah . In the Valley of Jezrul the army spread its camp . Among the tents that night , as among the marchers during the day , uneasy whispers circled . " This is David , the man of Judah who killed Goliath of Gath with sling and stone . " " This is the shepherd who was once armor-bearer to Saul . " " This is the dearest friend of Saul 's son Jonathan , who panicked our garrison one night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saul with the foreskins of two hundred Philistines as dowry when he married Saul 's daughter , Michal . " " This is David , whose tattered outlaws defeated us at Keilah . " " This is the shepherd of whom the women of Israel sang : Saul has slain his thousands And David his ten thousands . " Before midnight the kings of Gaza , Ashkelon , Ashdod and Ekron came in a body to the tent of Achish . " Our archers are restless , " said the king of Ekron . " They ask continually , What are these Hebrews doing in our company ? ' " Achish spread his hands and smiled , though he was dead for sleep . " Is not this David , who has been with me now for more than a year ? " The king of Ekron replied angrily , " Is not this David who gave the foreskins of two hundred Philistines as dowry for Saul 's daughter ? " Achish shrugged . " Who can say whether they were Philistines ? All I  | know is , he deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant . In all this time I have found no fault in him . He sends me tribute and holds back my enemies . He also holds back your enemies , my friends . All Philistia has been safe this past year from desert invaders . " The king of Gaza said , " That is true . We have had no trouble with Amalekites for more than a year . " The king of Ekron said , " Fighting Amalekites is different . How could this fellow better make peace with Saul than to attack us from within during the battle , and go to Saul bringing the heads of the five kings ? " Achish still smiled , though along his nerves prickled the fear of Israel 's god . Surely that god was seeking now to save David from the shedding of Hebrew blood . Yet how could such a god guide the thoughts of these kings of the plain ? " David is quite a fellow , " said Achish , smiling to hide his fear . " But he is hardly warrior enough to strike off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodyguards . Shall I call him here that you may look on him and see that he is only a man and no demon ? " The king of Ekron stood before Achish , arms folded , legs braced , black brows frowning . " You will fight this battle without these Hebrews , or you will fight it without the kings of Gaza , Ashdod , Ashkelon and Ekron . We are agreed on that . " " I will summon David , " Achish replied . " We have summoned him . He is outside the tent . " Achish stared about from one to another of his four friends . " You are four . I am one . I can not stand against you . " He raised his voice . " David . Come here . " David entered the tent . He was younger than any of the five kings , and of smaller stature , a lone Hebrew among the Philistine kings . Yet his blue eyes met the eyes of Achish without fear , open , submissive , trusting . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Achish felt trembling all along his limbs . In his mind he seemed to see Dagon , headless and handless , lying on the earth before a gold-crusted box . " You have been a true servant to me , friend David , " he said loudly . " I have found no fault in you since you came to Ziklag to fight my enemies . However , these friends of mine , kings of Ekron , Gaza , Ashkelon and Ashdod , do not trust you as I trust you . They prefer to fight this campaign without your help . Do n't be angry with them . They do not know you as I know you . They know only your mighty reputation . " David 's gaze held nothing but obedience and friendliness , yet the lines around his eyes vanished as suddenly as if washed out with water . David said quietly , " What fault have you found against me , that I may not go to fight the enemies of my lord of Gath ? " " You are blameless , David . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see evil where no evil exists . " The fault lay rather in a box overlaid with gold . But Achish could not now or ever speak such blasphemy openly against Dagon . David bowed . " What is your wish , my lord ? " " Rise early in the morning with your men . Start with the first light . Return the way you came . Take care that your men do not inflame these kings or the men who serve them , particularly in the matter of the song . Go to Ziklag . I will summon you when the campaign is ended and I am once more at Gath . " Ittai stood with Achish next morning and watched the last of the Hebrews march west toward Dothan . Ittai pushed up his helmet and scratched his head . " There goes our Samson , " said Ittai thoughtfully , " still wearing his hair . " Achish tried to shrug off the burden of defeat which had lain heavily on him all the long hours of the night . " We will attend to David another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attending to Saul would be easy . The god of the box was not with Saul in the mountains . The god of the box was traveling with David south through the Philistine plain . Ittai smiled . " Has it occurred to you , old friend , that we may be fighting David 's battle today , even more than our own ? " Achish said irritably , " I am a simple man , yet you persist in your subtleties and riddles . Go and see to the marching orders . The day will be gone before we are ready ! " For some time after Ittai went away , Achish still stood beside his iron chariot and gazed after the cloud of dust which marked the departing Hebrews . I wonder , thought Achish wearily , who started the rumors , the tales , the songs , which have set on edge the teeth of my friends the kings of Ekron , Gaza , Ashdod and Ashkelon ? 14 A BATTLE MAY end in a day or two , but the aftermath of victory takes many days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonoring and despoiling the dead , of pursuing a demoralized enemy and looting and raping in the undefended cities . The armies of Achish had this to do both in the mountains of Canaan and in the plain of Gilead beyond the Jordan . There was also the business of gathering trophies to be brought to Dagon . There was the business of hanging the dead body of Saul upon the wall of  | a mountain town called Bethshan , and of hanging the bodies of his three dead sons on the same wall . So more than a month had passed before the triumphant soldiers returned along the caravan route . Behind them they left garrisons to occupy the major towns and enforce the tribute . Behind them also they left the stench of uncounted dead . But the armor and regalia of Saul they carried with them , leaving a trophy from it in shrine after shrine in every city of the plain . The returning men were laden with spoil , and their wagons and donkeys were laden as well . The men marched in triumph , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has slain his thousands And we have slain Saul And three of the sons of Saul . " The song brought no pleasure to Achish . The long ordeal of butchery had brought no pleasure . The campaign had left only exhaustion and a longing for home and a chance to rest on a padded pigskin couch . How can a man take pleasure in dismembering a people whose god has forsaken them ? What pleasure would Dagon take in the armor of Saul ? So weary was Achish with his own thoughts that he sent for Ittai to make the journey from Ekron to Gath in his own chariot . Yet there was no pleasure in the company of Ittai , for Ittai wore the ironic smile which bewildered Achish , and spoke little of victory and much of David . " You shall love your friend and hate your enemy , " said Ittai , among other things . " Who now do you suppose is David 's enemy ? " " I am a simple man , " Achish said wearily . " Why do you plague me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hebrews will pay us tribute forever , so we need never again trouble ourselves with raids or petty forays . We are masters of the whole land , and David can not afford to be anything but friendly toward us . " Ittai said , shouting to be heard above the rumble of chariots and the singing of soldiers , " While I was in the camp of David I heard many tales told by the priest , Abiathar , who had read the ancient records written by scholars among his people . " " What is this of reading and writing ? What has that to do with our victory ? " " Would you not like to know , my lord Achish , that your children 's children would be able to read of this great victory we have won ? " " My children 's children will win their own victories . " Yet in the tired mind of Achish the thought of his children 's children reading with pride of the victories of King Achish held a certain beauty . To speak face to face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even an old man , weary of  | war and of feasting and of women , could take pleasure in such matters . To commune with one 's father 's fathers , with one 's children 's children ? this could give a man pleasure no matter how tired he had become . And to think that David , in exile , should have a resource so wondrous ' " I will send for this Abiathar , " he said . " I will compel him to write of our victory , to tell the number of the slain , the number of the cities , the value of the loot . " " What would be the good ? He does not write in our tongue . We would never know whether he wrote what we told him to write . Even if he did , our children 's children could not read the tongue of the people we have conquered . " A long silence fell in the chariot of King Achish . Presently Ittai said , " This priest tells a tale concerning the former adventures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that the Hebrews were formerly slaves in Egypt . But a mighty man came , a favorite of their god , Moses by name . Moses performed such magic before the Pharaoh that as a boon he was permitted to lead his race of slaves into the wilderness to sacrifice to their god . " But the time allotted for sacrifice went by , and the slaves did not return , and Pharaoh sent his army to bring them back by force . Yet Moses did not yield , but led his rabble straight on until they came to the sea . And he led his people straight on into the sea and it parted to let them go through ; but when the Egyptian army followed them , the sea came together and destroyed men , horses , and chariots . Is it not a wonderful tale ? " Achish said , " All people have their tales of gods and heroes . " " But not all people write down the tales , so they can not be forgotten . I tell you , my lord Achish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of his death at the hand of David , not because of what he wrought in his lifetime . People will know of Achish of Gath because he befriended David when Saul panted against him . And people will know of this victory of ours because we destroyed Saul and set David free to return to his own land . All this comes to pass because David has a scholar , but the Philistines have no scholars . " Anger churned in Achish , together with the bitter taste of dust on the lips and the itch of flesh too long confined in armor . He shouted , " Be silent . Leave me . I will hear no more insolence about my servant David . " " As you wish , my lord Achish . Will you permit me to return to my chariot ? " The ironic smile still remained on the mouth in its frame of silken beard . " You will remain . But you will be silent . You will trouble me no more with talk I do not wish to hear . The king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Hebrew cities . When I am at home , and have rested  | from the rigors of the campaign , I will bring David to Gath and destroy him and be done with him forever . " Outside the walls of Gath a small company of David 's men were camped . They had penned up a few score sheep and had hobbled a score of camels . Beside the wall lay piles of tents and rugs and blankets . One of the men came up to the chariot of Achish , bobbing up and down in an excess of humility which irritated Achish because he saw in it some of the irony he had seen too often lately in the face of Ittai . Ittai said , " This man is Ira , who has charge of the distribution of spoils taken in battle and of goods given in tribute . " Ira raised his face . His heavy eyes were slits as he gazed into the glare of the king 's armor and regalia . " Hail , 0 King Achish , and congratulations on your mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you , " said Achish . " We too , " Ira said humbly , " have won a small victory in your absence . David sends these few gifts in token of friendship for the king and people of Gath . " " David sends spoils so soon ? " " Aye , my lord Achish . A minor skirmish with Amalekites in the desert while you were winning great victories in the hills . " " David does well . He lost no time . " " He was obliged to lose no time , my lord . When we reached Ziklag after our march north with my lords of the plain , we found our city burned and our women and little ones stolen . We had marched north with every man , leaving Ziklag unguarded with disastrous results . However , we pursued the raiders , and found them feasting in their camp . We smote them by night as they feasted . We destroyed them utterly , except for those who escaped on racing camels . We recovered also our wives and little ones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We share the spoil with you , my lord Achish . " Achish nodded , glancing at Ittai , pleased with this new proof of David 's loyalty . Ittai was scowling at the man . " You heard of our victory and of Saul 's death ? " " Aye . A man brought word that the Philistines had conquered all Israel , and that Saul and three of his sons were dead . " Ittai said mildly , " David also is to be congratulated . His enemy is dead . " Ira bowed and said nothing . Achish said , " Go to David , my man . Tell him to come and feast with us , that we may enjoy the fruits of our two victories together . " Ira said humbly , " My lord , I regret that it will be impossible for David to come to Gath at this time . " " I order him to come ! "  | Ira bowed very low . " But David is no longer in Ziklag , my lord Achish . He has gone to Hebron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more urgent than the wishes of Achish of Gath ? " " David is being crowned king of Judah , my lord Achish . You must know , my lord , how busy a king is during the days of his anointing and the setting up of his affairs . " " David is king ? In Hebron ? " " Aye , my lord Achish . My lord David , king of Judah , sends his respects to my lord Achish , king of Gath , and hopes that the change in his situation will not alter the warm affection which exists between himself and the men of Gath . My lord David sends this further word , that he will continue to garrison Ziklag and to hold off the desert enemies of his kingdom and yours . " Ira bowed once more . " Is there any message to be taken to the king of Judah from the king of Gath ? " The words burst from Achish . " Who started the rumors , the tales , the songs which ran like fire through the Philistine armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David among them ? " For a moment the humility in Ira 's face was splintered by amusement . " Who could do such a thing , my lord ? Surely you have heard idle gossip or perhaps lies of soldiers who . . . " " I have heard no Philistine lies . I have been cheated and lied to by David , who came to me with every show of submission and friendship , then went his way to serve his own interests at my expense ! " Achish had said more than he meant to say . He had admitted here in the presence of Ittai that David had outwitted him . He swallowed past the smothering sensations in his chest . Ira said softly , " David did not lie to you . He served you faithfully , my lord Achish . I did not hear the rumors you speak of , but I did hear the song , and I heard David silencing the singers . Yet if the song helped to save David from the need to shed the blood of his people , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hearts of the soldiers to sing the song for David 's sake . I am only guessing , my lord , for I march not with the soldiers but with the donkey trains . " Achish spoke a sharp word to his driver , and the chariot whirled abruptly through the gate . But late that night , when the victory parade was concluded and the shouts of the people were subsiding into the sounds of feasting , Ittai found Achish in the anteroom , resting on the pigskin couch . Ittai sat on the rug . His eyes held affection , regret , and also a certain determination . " I have come to bid you good-by , old friend , " said Jttai . " Good-by ? "  | " I go in search of immortality . " " I am a simple man , friend Ittai . Speak simply to me . " " I am a man who has only one life to live , old friend . I want to spend my life serving the one great man I have known . Above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest finds a place in his records to write down the name of Ittai the Philistine , who became a servant to David . " " Ittail You are my right arm . You are my sword . How can I rule Gath without you ? I beg you not to leave me , Ittai . " " I go , old friend . Let us trust that my lord David never chooses to send me against the men of Gath , but that I can use what small talents I have to ensure continued friendship between David and Achish . " " I will have you seized before you pass the gate . I will have you cut to pieces and hung on the wall . " The threat had a strong sound , but there was only weakness in the voice . Achish lay on his couch , a tired , defeated man . Ittai said kindly , " It will be worth your while to have a friend in David 's court . " " Go then , " said Achish brokenly . " Go quickly . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you . " Ittai was gone . And Achish lay alone on his couch , and touched with his swollen fingers the cracked places where the leather had grown brittle . Tears rolled down into his beard , but he did not summon his servants , either to comfort him or to seize and torture Ittai . All rivers , murmured Achish with a deep sigh , turn in their courses to follow David as he moves across the land . The tears rolled from under his lids , and dropped onto the pigskin in great dark splotches.  | PART THREE Hebron I5 JOAB RETURNED TO Bethlehem in the month Tishri , when the winds change round from the eastern deserts to the western sea , bringing the rains . Along the roadside wild pomegranates hung brown and ripe upon their bushes , and beside the courtyard at home the last of the mulberries had been gathered to make into wine . And Joab led the sheep south and east , down into the Arabah where winter came late . He built himself a booth of poles and tent-cloth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When winter reached the Arabah he returned with the sheep to Bethlehem and sheltered them in sheds whose roofs of thatch sifted out most of the rain . Spring came , and the grain fields and pastures were delicately green , and the winds shifted round once more , blowing off the desert . The streams and cisterns were filled and all over the wilderness flowers bloomed in a riot of color . Then the sheep were sheared , after they had borne their lambs . And summer came , bringing harvest . Early grapes were gathered and made into wine , or laid upon the roof in the sun to make raisins . Summer passed , emptying streams and cisterns and baking the earth and the grass . And Joab learned that tragedy lies , not in moments of crisis , but in the long procession of nights which make up the cycle of the years . On the night when Reba married David , Joab had glutted himself with wine and had slept at last . But hundreds of nights came thereafter , when he lay beside the fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing and jealousy . While the nights came , one by one , the down on Joab 's cheeks turned into the crisp , sandy beard of a man . All through the lonely months , as he led the sheep or lay on the earth while they grazed , he remembered words spoken by Ira and Abiathar and Uriah , words which cut through barriers that had hemmed him round . His horizon had broadened in the wilderness , and now the hills of Judah set limits which were too narrow for his spirit and restlessness often took hold of him ; yet he did not know that he was restless for more than the love he had lost . Another spring came , and in Bethlehem it was known that the kings of  | the five cities of the Philistine plain had defeated Saul 's army on Mount Gilboa . Saul was dead , and David reigned in Hebron . Jesse the patriarch died in Moab while David lived in Ziklag . The sons of Jesse came home from the purple hills , bringing the body of their father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father Obed and his grandfather Boaz , and his grandmother Ruth the Moabitess . Here also lay the bones of Zeruiah 's husband , a man with yellow hair who had wandered in from the distant north , remained long enough to beget Seth and Joab and Asa , then died of a fever . After Saul fought his last battle against the federated cities of the plain , and was killed , hard times came to Israel . Every village and city paid tribute to the victorious Philistines . Philistine garrisons remained through all the northern and trans-Jordan tribes to enforce the tribute . Judah , however , was not occupied . David was king in Hebron . Through friendship with Achish , David was able to prevent the occupation of Judah , and by raids on desert peoples he was able to raise most of the tribute demanded by the five Philistine kings . News that David was in Hebron came to Bethlehem by messenger within a week of the news of Saul 's death . Messengers were running through all the towns and villages of Judah , summoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ceremony which would make David king of the one tribe . Young Asa , who was swift as a gazelle , set out for Moab that same day to carry the news to the sons of Jesse . Asa was seventeen when David became king in Hebron . Feeling himself a man , he clamored to offer himself to David , and Zeruiah , with the stone house she ruled once more overflowing with the sons and grandsons of Jesse , their wives and little ones and servants , sent him to Hebron willingly . Zeruiah was greatly impressed with David 's altered circumstances . She began to tell again the story of David 's anointing by Samuel , and to trace the strange pattern of his rising and falling and his rising again as a portent of greater glory ahead . " David is like a wind blowing over the land , " Zeruiah often declared . " He stirs us all from the petty daily round of duties to thoughts of glory . Go , my sons , and serve David . We suffered his disgrace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The elders blessed Asa , and he set out with a bedroll strapped to his back and a skin of wine on his shoulder to offer his swift young strength to David . He was made a runner . He stopped often at Bethlehem as he went and as he returned . Whenever Asa appeared the family sat long in the courtyard after the evening meal to listen far into the night to the tales Asa told of all that went on in Hebron . Asa 's first errand for David was to carry a message of conciliation to the elders of the town of Jabesh-Gilead . Gilead was a high land of green  | pastures and oak forests east of the Jordan where the tribes of Reuben , Gad , and Manasseh had settled when the other tribes crossed over to live in the hills of Canaan . The men of Jabesh-Gilead had marched to Bethshan by night after the disaster of Saul 's death to take down the headless , naked bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of the city . They brought the dishonored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient oak . Then they fasted and mourned for seven days . Fifteen miles from Jabesh , in the strong walled city of Mahanaim , Abner and Ishbosheth , the only surviving son of Saul , had found refuge . To the men of Jabesh David sent Asa with a message of friendship designed to heal the breach in Israel . Obed the Reubenite went with Asa on this errand . Obed was young , though not so young as Asa . He possessed swiftness of foot and the silver tongue of a royal messenger . Obed had been with David since he was a child and could offer his experience as a counterpoise to Asa 's impetuosity . Further , Obed was a Reubenite whose relatives in Gilead might provide shelter for the king 's messengers in case of trouble with adherents of Abner and Ishbosheth . The two boys were dressed as Joab had seen no men of David 's dressed before . They wore woolen cloaks girded for running , but carried in their bedrolls long linen cloaks which they would wear when they presented themselves before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their heads they had bound scarlet headcloths . They reached Bethlehem in the late afternoon to spend the night . They would rise well before dawn to make the long run to Jabesh the following day . After the evening meal Asa prowled about the court , restless with the gravity of his errand . The firelight and the torchlight played upon his sober face . " Who could guess , " said Asa in wonder , " that David would seek the friendship of these people , after all they 've done to him ? He could easily defeat and destroy them now , for they are prostrate . David is friend of the king of Gath . He commands hundreds of deserters from the north , plus all the twelve companies he brought back from the Philistine exile . " Zeruiah exclaimed , " How does he feed them all ? " Asa shrugged . " The gifts from Judah have been abundant , since David is keeping Philistines , Edomites and Amalekites off the land . The raids on the desert people go on . And of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer who manages it all very well for him . " Asa 's young voice grew sweet and full , as David 's had been at seventeen . " Listen , " said Asa . Half closing his eyes , and chanting in solemn dignity , Asa spoke the words David had given him to speak to the elders of Jabesh , rehearsing them to impress his family and also to improve his delivery when he reached the city where he was to represent David . Blessed are you of the Lord , because you have shown this kindness to  | Saul , and have given him holy burial . May the Lord show kindness to you . I will show you kindness also . Let your hands be strong and valiant , for Saul your king is dead , and the men of Judah have made me king over them . " Asa opened his eyes , smiling on his assembled kindred . Zeruiah 's eyes flashed admiringly . " Well , now , David is a true statesman , and perhaps he will not go through life making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , who can see the ripe fruit when the bud is on the bough ? " Obed said soberly , " I doubt that David turns the men of Jabesh from Abner to himself . Of all towns , Jabesh has most reason to love Saul and to honor and protect Saul 's son . The story is often told in Gilead . This town of Jabesh was the first which Saul delivered from their enemies . The men of Rabbah-Ammon attacked Jabesh , and besieged the town . If they had taken it they would have gouged out the right eye of every man , but Saul raised an army and marched to Jabesh and destroyed the army of the Ammonites . " But Zeruiah would not hear doubts spoken by an outsider . " So much the wiser then , " she said firmly , " is David to direct his first act of conciliation to Jabesh . If only he could offer proof of his good intentions . " Asa smiled down on his mother . Her spirit and determination far outweighed her meager stature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her reassuringly . " There is a song I am to sing for David beside the oak tree where Saul is buried . David first sang the song when he learned that Saul and Jonathan were dead . " Asa closed his eyes and lifted his face . His voice was sweet and true , as David 's had been when he sang in this same courtyard . " The beauty of Israel is slain upon the high places . How are the mighty fallen ! Tell it not in Gath , publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon ; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph . From the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , the bow of Jonathan turned not back , and the sword of Saul returned not empty . Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided ; They were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions . Ye daughters of Israel , weep over Saul ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I am distressed for thee , my brother Jonathan ; very pleasant hast thou been unto me ;  | Thy love was wonderful , passing the love of women . How are the mighty fallen , and the weapons of war perished ! " Zeruiah 's eyes were wet as she embraced Asa . " It is a good song , showing in its beauty better than many spoken words the unity of Israel against the uncircumcised . And your singing enhances its beauty . " Obed said , " We are to speak in every quarter of David 's grief for Saul 's death , and of David 's great love for Jonathan . We are to remind the elders that David spared Saul more than once in the wilderness . We are to remind them that David has never shed Israelite blood . " Joab had listened in silence till now . He asked , suppressing with difficulty the bitter jealousy he felt , " And what will you say when they mention that David was serving Achish at the very time when the men of Gath killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David was not in Gath at the time , nor in the plain . He was in the desert , chasing Amalekites . And nobody hates Amalekites more than the people of Israel . They were our first enemies . Abiathar has told me how they attacked our people when they first appeared in the desert after crossing the Red Sea . While our people made the tedious journey through the desert , all unprepared as they were , without knowledge of war or reserves of food and water , fed on heavenly manna and little else , the Amalekites skulked along for days and weeks , torturing stragglers and raping women who fell behind the main body . " Joab hid the smile which rose when he heard these brutal words fall so innocently from young Asa . " Joshua organized a company of soldiers , " Asa said earnestly . " Our people knew only slavery . Yet they fought the Amalekites at last , while Moses stood upon a hill the whole day with his arms upraised . When his arms were weary , Aaron his brother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see that he did not falter . And the Amalekites were destroyed . Those that did not die fled , though we were but rabble while they were seasoned desert fighters . And these are the enemies David pursued while Achish marched against Saul . " Zeruiah said proudly , " You are a true envoy for David . May God bring you success . " Obed said , as though he hoped to win for himself some measure of Zeruiah 's approval , " We will also tell how a young man came to David , boasting that he was the one who killed Saul on Mount Gilboa , and exhibiting bits of Saul 's regalia which he had stolen to prove his story . He expected David to reward him . But David had the man put to death , and left his flesh to rot in the sun beside the burned and broken walls of Ziklag. "  | Asa cried , " We will also tell how Achish ordered David to march against Saul , and of the strategems by which fear and doubt were planted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other cities refused to proceed further until David had been ordered back south . David 's wisdom in that affair was something marvelous , I can tell you . And we will talk of it in every quarter in Jabesh . " Suddenly the tide of talk about David 's wisdom , magnanimity , and loving kindness was too much for Joab . He rose and left the house . He went to the pasture and sat with his back against the fold . He stared at the stars , and thought of David , who was a king , and of Reba , who lived in a king 's harem and who had borne David 's first-born son , and had called him Amnon . She knew what she was doing , he thought bitterly , when she chose David over me . And yet under the bitterness he knew full well Reba had not chosen David . He sat there through the night , sometimes cursing , sometimes weeping , and within him the question grew and grew . David , David , you are the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only love ? Ib THE GILEADITES RECEIVED Asa and Obed coldly . They returned to David no messages of friendship . Months later the two runners returned northwest , circling Gilead , to arrange a marriage between David and the daughter of the king of the Syrian city of Geshur . The girl , whose name was Maacah , was a strapping , swarthy lass of fifteen . Thus the land of Gilead and the northern provinces of Israel were protected from enemies to the north and east , since the king of Geshur was now David 's ally . And so David strengthened his position and influence , protecting even the tribes which refused him friendship . In the northern provinces the people suffered much deprivation from the occupying Philistines , while Abner and Ishbosheth skulked in Gilead . But in Hebron , David as king and judge was maintaining friendship with the Philistines , paying the tribute with spoil . So David and Judah grew stronger year by year , while in the north the tribes had no rest from the constant draining away of their resources . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek , " Abiathar had said , when David returned without bloodshed from his march against Nabal . And Zeruiah often said , " There is a wind blowing over the land , and the wind is David . " Whoever gets in David 's way might as well throw himself under one of the Philistine chariots of war , Joab would reflect . Pride in David was  | never absent from his thoughts , as he wrestled with anger and resentment and loneliness . Joab knew nothing of war , except at second hand . For a summer he had been a messenger for David and assistant to Ira . He had been a shepherd since the age of nine ; the years went by and he remained a shepherd in spite of Zeruiah 's frequent hints that now there was sufficient help about the place , in case he wanted to return to David 's service . There were many nights when he hungered for savage destruction , remembering the godlike power he had felt in the moment when he plunged the knife into Lem 's yielding flesh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not against a mean enemy , but against Israel 's enemies . Love of Reba had opened his heart to a growing sense of family , of tribe , of nation . Again and again he rehearsed his plan to take Jerusalem , until he was sick with the frustration of knowing how easily it could be done if only he could persuade David . Everyone loves David , he thought , except for those who envy him . Abner was one of those . Am I also one of those , he wondered ? There were nights when he remembered only that he loved David and admired him . He recalled the songs David used to sing in the pastures , or sitting high in the sycamine tree above the court of the house in Bethlehem . He remembered how carefully David had taught him how to use knife and sling , how to kill with a single thrust the beasts which came prowling up from the wilderness . There were many nights when Joab thought only of Reba , wondering whether life in David 's harem suited her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ira and Abigail and longed to see these friends . Yet he could not bring himself to come within reach of David or chance again the wounds a great man can casually inflict upon those dependent on his care and goodwill , Then the choice was made for him . The Moabite wife of Eliab , eldest son of Jesse , had brought to Bethlehem a sister called Lisha . Lisha was only a child when she first came to Bethlehem , but the years changed that . Lisha had become a plump , vigorous young girl with hot dark eyes and a habit of wriggling and squealing whenever a male was about . Lisha helped in the house , grinding the barley and wheat , sweeping the stone paving , crushing olives to extract their oil and grapes to extract their wine . On the slightest excuse she was capable of girding her skirts to scandalous heights on her plump legs . It was thus that she went into the fields to carry messages or packets of food to the shepherds . When she was twelve any man would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she was fourteen she had singled out Joab . She made excuses to come when he was with the sheep , and to linger into the night until he drove her away . She was careless with her garments ,  | throwing herself onto the grass so her cloak fell away to reveal more than a man might wish to see . She loved to kick off her sandals and wade into the stream , folding her skirts about her hips and squealing about the coldness of the water or the slipperiness of the stones . She was never still and every movement served to remind a man of all that is lusty in a girl . The hunger Lisha roused in Joab was no more like the love he had felt for Reba than the desert 's parching summer wind is like the winter breeze which blows in from the sea . I despise her , Joab told himself , even while he could not forget the curve of her thigh or the pressure of her plump breasts as she threw herself against him when a lizard scuttled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell himself , as if she were choosing merchandise in a bazaar . He had seen her kind in Hebron . He felt a certain compassion for her , remembering the energy with which she did her work . Lisha was not a bad girl , not yet . She was the victim of her own strong vitality . And Joab remembered Benaiah , in whom good and evil were tangled beyond separation . There were times when Joab hungered to take this girl and tame her and give her children on whom she could lavish her love-hunger . Yet he thought of the emptiness of her chatter and had no wish to be bound to her for a lifetime . He knew that no grandson of Jesse could afford to lust after the sister-in-law of Eliab unless he was willing to make her his wife . Yet he could not deny that he lusted . When he heard her laughter in the pastures his senses leaped and when she threw herself upon him he itched to drive his fingers deep into her flesh until she shrieked with pain or pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the moon was full , Joab found himself thinking of the high places of the Caananites , and of the revels the men of Uriah 's band held on nights like this . Sick of his thoughts , Joab took his sling and a handful of stones . He chose as target a stunted acacia beyond the stream and set to work to improve his skill with the weapon which had first brought fame to David . Again and again he whirled the sling and let fly the stone . Presently he heard across the stream the beginning of the giggle he had learned to know so well . But the stone had already left the sling . The giggle changed to a scream and the figure which had appeared suddenly from over a hill fell to the earth and rolled , as Lisha 's screams filled the night . Joab leaped over the stream and ran to Lisha and pulled her head upon his knee and her hand from the wound . The blood ran over his hands , warm and thick . Yet he saw that the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobe of her ear . And Joab was burning suddenly with a savage wish to hurt this girl in ways she could never forget , to give her cause for her senseless screaming . He jumped to his feet , wild  | with the stickiness of her blood on his hands , the warm smell of it in his nostrils . " Go to the stream and bathe your face , " he told her hoarsely . She rose obediently . " You bathe it , Joab , " she whimpered . " It burns like fire . Wash away the pain , Joab . " Her girdle had fallen from her and her cloak hung open and loose and Joab saw that her tunic was torn . Panting with the tempest of his own hunger and revulsion , Joab pushed back her cloak . He dug his fingers into her bare shoulders , and the tunic slid to reveal the full circle of one plump , soft breast . The girl burrowed against him with a wantonness beyond imagining . Her panting and whimpering brought to mind a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunting and gurgling pleasure of the ewe when the lamb was found and could suckle the distended udder again . Remembering the ewe , filled with his own tangled emotions , Joab bent swiftly and set his mouth on the breast , and clamped his teeth together so viciously that he tasted the blood on his tongue . Lisha did not run from him . She stood before him , sobbing with her face uncovered in the bright moonlight . Joab spat out the blood . " You , " he said , filled with loathing . " You are of the family of Jesse , yet you run sporting and squealing through the pastures , uncovering your body . I am ashamed for my family , that you are one of us . " The triumph he had felt in the moment when hatred for Lem fused into the strength of the arm , the thrust of the sword , was upon him now . " You hurt me , Joab , " Lisha sobbed . " You hurt me . " Her eyes held a queer shine . Joab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he need not look on her uncovered body any longer . " You want a husband , " he said through gritted teeth . " You know that only a husband of the family of Jesse can prevent your being turned out on the roads sooner or later as a harlot . You want me to take you tonight for your pleasure , but also so you can go to Zeruiah tomorrow and tell her a tale such that she would take me before the elders and marry you to me . No , thank you , my girl . " Joab turned from her and started to Bethlehem , running to the great stone house , running to Zeruiah . " I must leave this place , " he told Zeruiah through pale , tight lips . " I will kill someone of this household if I do not go where I can kill someone in battle . The lust for blood or for women or for both is so hot in me I dare not spend another night in this place . " Zeruiah stared at her reasonable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perhaps some understanding of its cause . She wept a little , and gathered up gifts for him to take to David . And Joab  | strapped up his bundle and shouldered his hamper . She gave him her blessing . Then he set out along the highway which runs from Bethlehem to Hebron . 17 THE HIGHWAY FOLLOWS the central watershed of Judah in such a way that at times Joab had a glimpse of the golden wilderness on his left , and at other times he saw the green valleys which are thrust like extended fingers westward toward the Philistine plain . Beyond the plain was the Great Sea , which was a highway for the ships of Egypt and Phoenicia and far , mysterious islands . Joab had never yet stood beside the Great Sea , though he had heard Seth tell how the soldiers of David had marched along its shore . When Joab saw the glimmering blue in the distance , he thought how it would be to leave these hills and sail over the waters to far-off lands . He thought of the bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had seen in the bazaars of Hebron and Jerusalem the lumber and cloth brought by Phoenician merchants , the gold and ivory and grain brought from Egypt and the hot lands of the black men beyond Egypt , the iron of Cappadocia , and the tin and copper of the Sinai desert . As the distance from Hebron lessened and the miles lengthened which separated Joab from Bethlehem and from Lisha , Joab forgot the savage emotions of the night . His mind moved beyond the bounds of the usual , to speculation about people and the ways in which they differ from one another . He thought of those who tend sheep , those who till the fields , those who fight the wars , those who dig in the earth to bring out metals , both precious and useful . He thought of tradesmen who travel on the seas and in caravans , and who chaffer over prices in bazaars . He thought of men like Abiathar who live for religion and the written word , and of David who led many men and was loved by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands were prepared to give their lives . And again he thought how simple life would become if only he could go willingly into David 's service . Joab was still half an hour from Hebron when he met Abiathar on the road . He approached Abiathar , smiling joyfully at sight of the old friend . After a moment of staring scrutiny , Abiathar 's mind returned from its far journey . Abiathar 's warm smile held all the affection of another summer , as if there had been no intermission of years since last they met . He laid his arms on Joab 's shoulders and touched his cheek against Joab 's sandy beard . " My good friend , " he said warmly , " we meet again after long absence . " Abiathar was well fed , clean , dressed in new linen which gleamed with  | bleach . His girdle and headcloth were dyed blue . The tassels of his girdle hung to his cloak hem . His beard had been washed and combed . Joab held Abiathar at arm 's length . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have the look of a man who is well tended . " Abiathar shook his head . " I leave matrimony to David . He has wives enough to supply a troop , and troubles enough to warn us all . Nevertheless I am , as you say , well tended . Reba looks after me . I would not dare appear on the street without putting on a clean cloak and combing my beard . " Abiathar smiled , then sobered quickly . " Reba watches over me like a ? a sister . She says the king 's high priest must be a credit to him . " He sighed . " Perhaps she is right . Though to me it seems she makes much of nothing . Yet I thank God for Reba , for she is a dear friend and has become a remarkably good and sensible woman , " Joab felt a trembling pass over him at the companionable intimacy of the priest 's words . To be Reba 's good friend  --  since one could never hope for more  --  to see her daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ! Abiathar 's gaze had wandered from Joab off into some urgent land of the mind . He turned toward the trees which were thickening along the eastern hills beside the highway . His brows formed a troubled frown . " I have found another of the abominations of the uncircumcised , " he said . " Come with me , Joab . " " Where are you going ? " " To the camp of Uriah to protest once more . Uriah does not heed the warning of a priest of the Lord . Perhaps he will listen to David 's cousin . " Joab drew back , unwilling to be drawn into Abiathar 's wars . " I will go another day . Today I am eager to report to David and see whether he has use for me . " Abiathar plucked at his sleeve . " You wo n't be able to talk to David today . He 's celebrating the weaning of his third son , an infant he has named Absalom . David will be feasting all day and probably all night . David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sons ? Whose  --  whose child is this one ? " " This is the son of the princess Maacah , daughter of the king of Geshur . A lusty , thriving boy . David is out of his senses with pride . All Hebron is celebrating today . " Joab smiled . The thought of David absorbed in Maacah and her lusty son made him strangely happy . He was willing to indulge the priest , and turned to follow Abiathar into the forest . They followed a well-beaten trail . Presently they came to a hill which rose as high as the tops of the surrounding oaks . Abiathar led the way to its rocky summit . The gaunt face of the priest was agitated as he bent  | over a mixture of cold ashes and charred bones to which bits of scorched flesh still clung . " God of Abraham , " he muttered in a tone too agitated to be reverent . " Last night they were here again . Only last night . " Joab thought of his own restlessness last night , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Canaanites called worship . Here , in this spot ? He shrugged away the thoughts and pictures which came to mind . Abiathar stirred among the ashes with a broken branch . He pondered one long thigh bone for some time . At last he remarked with a deep sigh , " I can not say certainly that it is human . Come , Joab . We will take it along when we confront Uriah . You bring it . I can not bear to touch the thing . " Joab had no wish to touch the bone either , but then , he had no wish to argue with the stubborn , single-minded priest . He picked up the smokeblackened remnant and knocked off the clinging ash and stuffed it into his girdle beside the sheathed knife . Its touch seared him though its ash was dead , for it had been burned to Baal . Abiathar and Joab found a sentry sleeping heavily beside the path at the edge of the Canaanites ' camp . When they shook him awake he went , yawning and cursing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant-faced , with a great nose and a sensual , smiling mouth , was a man of fanatical loyalty both to his own men and to David . He greeted them with a wide smile . A tawny lionskin gave scant covering to his square , muscular body . His chest and face and legs were covered with coarse dark hair . He kicked at the dogs which slunk about his legs and cursed them in the Hittite tongue . Abiathar hurried through the necessary courtesies . Then , pointing to the bone Joab held , he demanded , " Is this bone human ? " Uriah 's smile gleamed . " Our cult does not demand human sacrifice . " Joab was surprised . " It does n't ? " He had supposed the pagan cults were a hodgepodge of everything obnoxious to pious Hebrews . " Our worship concerns fertility and abundance  --  life , not death . " Uriah smiled and yawned . " Forgive me , please . One sleeps sound , after a night of the full moon . " His smile was for Joab now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joab . You have been long away . Have you prospered ? " Abiathar laid his hand on Uriah 's sweat- and earth-caked shoulder , then jerked it fastidiously away . " Give me a straight answer about this bone , man . No evasions . " " It is the bone of a sheep . " " It is too long for a sheep . " " It was a long sheep , friend Abiathar . " Abiathar 's exasperation did not abate . " You serve David badly in bringing pagan worship among his men . "  | " We do not invite his men to join us . Our priestesses complain of them . If you can keep them away , we will be grateful . They cavort among us like naughty children , without respect or reverence or knowledge of the sequence proper to the rites . We have too few women who are willing to serve as priestesses at the full moon , and your men discourage those who are willing . " Uriah 's dark eyes were troubled . " We , too , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice was tense with anger . " There is one God , and He is the Lord . " Uriah 's shrug and smile held only tolerance for Abiathar 's peculiar view . " We served Baal long before you brought your deity into our hills . Your deity is one I can not understand . If we can not see him or touch him , how can we worship ? He is too subtle for us . " Joab envied Uriah , who believed with all his being in Baal . He envied Abiathar , whose faith in the Lord was a mighty hand gripping his hand and sustaining and leading him . Faith , thought Joab , is a grace of the spirit . I wish I possessed this grace . Aloud he said , " Nor can I understand this God of the Hebrews , though I am a Hebrew and a grandson of Jesse . " Abiathar cried in anguish at the stupidity of men . " If God were so small that a man 's mind could contain Him , what would there be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a troubled sigh , " these questions are not for me to answer . My people serve David as best they can . We remain in camp on your Sabbath . We bring David a share in all our spoils . We refrain from marching north against Abner and Ishbosheth , though a week 's work would wipe them out utterly . Leave us the consolation of our high places and do not be troubled about us . " Abiathar 's full lips tightened over his teeth in an expression of outrage . " You ask the priest of the Lord to speak approval of your high places ? " Joab laid his hand on Abiathar 's arm . " Uriah does not ask you to approve . He asks you to ignore . To tell the truth , I do not Moses brought the Lord down from Sinai . " Abiathar 's look and gesture indicated utter discouragement . " Moses did not bring the Lord down from Sinai ! The Lord brought Moses up to Sinai . The Lord brought Moses and our people out of Egypt , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people the law by means of Moses , because Moses was a man who had an ear to hear and a heart to understand and a mind to obey . " Abiathar 's sigh was profound . " Still , you are not to blame if you do not understand these mysteries . As for you , Uriah , you are not to blame that you were born a Hittite . You have served David well in all things except this one . I can not stop you in this . Yet I can protest when such  | abominations are brought within reach of our men to debauch and contaminate them . And if ever I find a human bone among the ashes ? " " Now , now , you do not understand our cult any better than we understand yours , friend Abiathar . Human sacrifice belongs to cities and to kings . We are a mixed company of hangers-on made up of many peoples , with no roots and no homes . We are a conquered , motley group , and eventually we will intermarry with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple revels help to make our meager life bearable . " Abiathar said bitterly , " Mixed peoples , mixed worship , mixed wines ? these lead only to evil . Well , friend Uriah , we will meet on a happier occasion when the council convenes tomorrow . God bring you to an understanding of Himself . " Uriah saluted cheerfully , yawning . Abiathar turned and disappeared on the path by which he had come , but Joab lingered . He touched Uriah 's arm , and did not mind the touch of flesh soiled in service of an honest faith . " If it is true you have trouble finding priestesses  --  I know of a certain Moabitess who seems to have been formed for just such a purpose . Yet I would not want her identity known , if she served Baal in the company of your people . " Uriah 's smile was broad and affectionate . " We will talk of it another time , friend Joab . I am dying on my feet . " Still Joab lingered . " Is it true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aye , Joab . We itch for action against our enemies . " " Can David be persuaded ? " " By a cousin , perhaps . Not by me . " Joab raised his hand in salute . " It was good to see you today , friend Uriah . " Joab followed Abiathar up the path among the trees . For every vessel , he was thinking , there is a use . Even for such as Lisha there is a use . And the thought washed from him the sickness of disgust he had felt toward the girl and eased his mind of its shame . I will attend to the matter before the next full moon , he resolved . With the resolve came something like respect for Lisha . Surely she was formed to serve the gods of her people . Joab overtook Abiathar at the edge of the forest and plucked at his sleeve . By the surprise on the gaunt face he knew the priest had forgotten him completely . " Do you still write the records of David ? " Joab inquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not often . David has become so comfortable and content in his big house with his wives and concubines and his little ones that he forgets the work to which the Lord has appointed him . His companies are idle in  | camp and every day more men from Israel march to Hebron to join his forces . On every side men wait to march against Abner in order to strengthen themselves so they may meet the Philistines . Yet David is idle . What is there to say except that David dwelt in Hebron , and sons and daughters were born unto him ? " 18 DAVID 'S NEW HOUSE stood near the north gate of Hebron , which is the main gate of the city . It was in the north gate that David had sat in judgment from the day he was made king until the judgment court of his house was ready to be occupied . Today 's feast was set in the great court , though workmen were still occupied with fitting stones in the walls and in the archway of the imposing entrance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Hebron , as a city of refuge , was a place where the judge would be in demand almost daily throughout the year . Still , on most days , David contrived to be finished before noon with his work as judge , and whenever domestic affairs were pressing , he was able to dispense with the work of the court . Joab passed the big front entrance with its honor guard of soldiers in short cloaks , dyed girdles , and leather breastplates . He glanced through the open gate at the celebrating throng and went on around to the camel gate at the back of the house . This gate opened onto the courtyard which served the household . The harem opened off this court . A row of fireplaces where meals and even feasts could be prepared filled the back of the court , near the wall . Joab found an old comrade from Maon dozing beside the door . He embraced Joab and admitted him readily . When the man saw that the concubines were busy at the fires , he himself showed Joab the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little water into a brass basin , stripped off the dusty cloak and sandals , and scrubbed himself . He rubbed himself dry with a piece of linen and put on a clean white tunic and cloak with a girdle of dyed Tyrian linen , bought recently in the Jerusalem bazaar . The girdle was scarlet and brought sharply to mind the bright colors Reba loved to wear . He cleaned his sandals of the dust from the highway , combed his hair and beard , and thought a mouthful of the wine flowing in the front court would be welcome . His mouth was dry and his throat was clogged and there was a strange feeling of pressure behind his eyes . The truth was , he dreaded seeing what the years might have done to Reba . I 'll go away , he thought . I 'll find Ira and spend the night with him . I will return tomorrow and pay my respects to David and his household .  | He rolled up the mat , tucking his soiled garments inside . Now he was ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rust-colored skirt in a far doorway caught his eye . He turned and saw Abigail . She saw him in the same moment and moved quickly toward him , both hands stretched out . She seemed quite oblivious of the disarray of her dark hair , of the way her girdle had come loose and hung , only half knotted , down about her hips . The rust-colored cloak flapped open as she walked , revealing a soiled white tunic below . Something had blurred the firmness of her mouth , and her eyes were vague even when she smiled . Yet her step was quick and light as ever , and Joab remembered with pleasure the deep-folded corners of her full mouth . " Joab , my friend and kinsman ! " Abigail laid her hands on his shoulders in a gesture Zeruiah often used , and Joab felt a rush of affection as he had with Abiathar and Uriah . Abigail said , " Welcome to Hebron , Joab . Do rest here and talk to me before you join the celebration . How well you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are all older , " Joab said somberly . A film of tears washed her dark eyes . Joab took her hands and held them closely , ignoring the maids who passed across the court with platters and basins of smoking food for the feast in the main courtyard . How seldom Joab had thought of Abigail these past years , yet how very fond of her he was . How much fonder he was of all these friends than he had remembered . " You must join David and the men of Hebron and enjoy the celebration ! David has weaned another son . His third . A strong , beautiful , lusty boy ! How he squalled , that one , on the day he was born ! And when he was circumcised ! You should have heard him , Joab . " Abigail laughed gleefully , yet the laughter seemed unreal as if she might more readily have wept . " You have a son , Abigail . How old is he ? " " He is five years old now , Joab . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , when he is stronger . Such a pretty child , Joab . He has David 's red hair and blue eyes . " Sadness crept into her face . " I only wish he were stronger . " " Is n't he well ? " She looked up quickly with a smile that was too bright , too determinedly brave . " Daniel is fine . So affectionate , so dependent ! Oh , he coughs . During the rains each winter he breathes harshly . But he will outgrow all that and be a second David . Oh , Joab , he is such a darling child . He has the child 's gift of a loving heart . As David has  --  had  --  must have had when he was very young . If I could have borne this son for David when I was young  --  as Maacah is young  --  if I could have given him vigor and health  | the things he lacks . But he will find strength for himself presently . When he outgrows the harem and goes to live among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make him strong . " " Tell me about this third son of David 's . " He wanted her to talk of Reba and her little Amnon . But he could not seem to bring the question out directly . If Abigail talked long enough of the sons of David she was bound to speak of Amnon and Reba . " Such a beautiful boy ! You never saw a child with such black hair ! Maacah is his mother . Only a child herself , but so vigorous , so lively . She does us all good with her fresh , gay spirit . How often I say to myself it is no wonder Absalom is such a brute . If I could have borne David a son when I was her age  --  but that is so silly . I was just that age when I married Nabal . " She burst into a storm of weeping . Joab put his arm around her shoulder and pulled her head against him , and she clung to him . Joab waited for her weeping to subside , embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to say that would comfort her . He became conscious of his hand , foolishly patting Abigail 's shoulder . It was a gesture designed to comfort a child who has stubbed its toe , not a woman whose world lies in ruins . He doubled his fist to stop the foolish patting and waited for the storm to pass . Presently Abigail wiped her eyes on her sleeve and turned the overbright smile on him . " I ca n't think what got into me . I was awake with little Daniel much of the night . When he gets choked there is nothing to do but have him sit on my lap and sleep with his face against my shoulder . I would n't dare to leave him for a moment even when  --  even if David were to send  --  that is  --  forgive me , Joab . I ca n't seem to stop my tongue from wagging . " She went to the washroom and washed her face and returned . " Do forgive me . " Her speech was the babbling , repetitious speech of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you , and I ca n't think what got into me to burst into tears like that ! " She patted his hand vaguely . " You must get to know Maacah , Joab . We all love her . She has such zest . David forgets all his troubles , I think , in the pleasure of her youthful vitality . " " His troubles ? David has a palace , a family , a kingdom ! His men grow in numbers year by year . His people love and honor him . " " David enjoys Hebron , of course . But he can not be happy while Israel is divided . It gravels his soul to be subject to Achish , to be unable to unite and defend Israel . And so he waits in Hebron , comforting himself with wives and concubines . As he comforted himself in Maon . Remember how he took first Dinah , and then that other young girl  --  what was her name ? I never seem to recall it . " Abigail laughed merrily . " Love comforts David as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Seven of the women of the harem are with child  --  three wives , four concubines . And little Absalom just weaned . Oh , David takes great comfort in domestic life . " Abigail laughed as if she would never stop . Still laughing , she rose . She tapped his shoulder in a merry gesture and moved toward the door whence she had first come . " I must see to my child . Do look in on us often , now that you have finally found your way to Hebron . " Joab watched her walk away with her quick , light step . The loosened girdle fell unnoticed on the pavement as she disappeared through one of the doorways . But Joab did not think of that . For Reba had entered through an adjacent doorway . She wore a blue cloak , a scarlet mantle , a girdle rich with silver embroidery . She clasped the hand of a small , sandy-haired , gray-eyed boy who was dressed in exquisite garments of blue linen . Joab scarcely breathed at sight of them , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , holding out his hands . She released the child . Her golden bracelets jangled as she laid her hands in his . " When I looked to see who had sent Abigail off on one of her spells again , it was you ! Oh Joab , why did you stay so long away from us all ? " Joab shook his head , unable to speak . Reba freed her hands and pulled the child against her skirts . " Amnon , darling , this is your  --  cousin , Joab . " The child stared at Joab with eyes in which curiosity blended with insecurity . He bobbed his head . " Is he your cousin too , mother ? " " He is David 's cousin . " She hugged the child excitedly . " You do n't know how happy I am to see you , Joab . You just do n't know . " " I know . " Joab felt lightheaded . He seemed to be surrounded , not by the walls of the court but by the golden stretches of the aromatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look away , yet when they went to the boy he could not look away from him , either . This was no son of David ! He has my eyes , my hair , my arching brows ! When was he born ? Joab saw hostility gather in the child 's eyes at the intense inspection , and turned quickly to Reba . It was incredible that she should be both older and the same . Level brows , feathery hairline , dark , direct eyes  --  even the bangles and neckband were the same , except these were of gold , while those Abigail had given her were of silver and brass . It was incredible that the years had left her so like the girl he had loved in the wilderness . Only the sweet firmness about the mouth was new . He blinked away the haze , cleared his throat and reached again to take her hands . " You have n't changed at all . Except to grow more beautiful . " " You 've changed , Joab . " Reba touched her palm quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were still a boy with down on your cheeks . Oh Joab , why must we grow older ? " Joab left the stone bench and moved restlessly across the paved court . How could he talk to Reba with this child watching ? He is my son ! Does David know ? Surely David must know ! The servants came and went and Joab could not think of a thing to say that was fit to be heard by the servants or the child . Again he cleared his throat . He said , " I saw Abiathar this morning . We visited the camp of Uriah . Abiathar looks very well . He says you are attending to his needs . " Reba smiled serenely . " It comforts me to sew for Abiathar . He has done more for David than anyone will ever know . " " Yes , " Joab said . " Yes , of course . " He had to touch that boy . He could not keep back his hands . There was a lock of sandy hair that fell over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not wear a headcloth . He brushed it back and swallowed past the smothering sensation in his throat . " Amnon , " he said , " my  --  my ? Amnon , I 'm glad to know you . " The child stared at Joab resentfully and dodged beyond his reach . " He is having a bad day , " Reba said in apology . " For years he was monarch of the household and unused to competition . Then Absalom came along , and now seven babies are to be born into the harem before spring . This court will be full of flapping linens and squalling small fry . " " Amnon was monarch ? What about Abigail 's little boy ? " All the brightness washed out of Reba 's face . " Poor little Daniel . He will not be with us long . The wonder is he has lived till now . I sometimes think Abigail keeps him breathing by the sheer , desperate force of her longing . " " What ails her ? She could not seem to remember your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hurt her . She even pretends nothing serious is wrong with Daniel . I think she will be friends with me again , presently . She and I were  --  alone together  --  for so long , while David was fighting the battles of Achish , and while he was getting settled in Hebron , setting up a tax system , organizing border defenses . This feeling Abigail has about me came then . She loved David so much , and he ? " " Loved you , " Joab said , low-voiced . He wished desperately the servants would go away and leave him alone with Reba and this child . So much was clamoring to be said . Yet even this was a thousand times better than to be in Bethlehem and never see her lovely , serene , compassionate face . Reba said , " David has ten wives now and a score of concubines . Abigail can not go on hating me forever . " She drew Amnon against her and brushed back the lock of hair that fell over his eyes . " When my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to live with David in the men 's rooms . Then  | Abigail will remember that I am lonely and will no longer hate me . Abigail started by pretending that truth is only what she wanted it to be . Now she blames me for much that is not my fault . " Joab said , " Can we go somewhere , away from this hubbub ? " " Of course . " Reba took Amnon by the hand and led the way out the back gate along a path to a nearby well . They sat on its rim . Their eyes met and Joab thought , I ca n't bear to look at her and not be able to touch her . He said , " Marriage agrees with you , Reba . You are ? beautiful . " Reba 's voice was low . " I know nothing of marriage . Harem life is not marriage . David would be the first to say so . It is being the mother of my son which agrees with me . " She held Amnon so tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit on the grass nearby . Joab said , " When will Amnon be seven ? " He knew the answer . The boy 's birthday would surely occur sometime during the early spring . Reba 's eyes met his serenely . " In the spring . A few weeks before Passover . " Joab 's eyes wandered from hers . His lips trembled with this confirmation of the thing he had surely known from the moment he saw the boy . Reba said quickly , very low , " David told me  --  once  --  that if I had loved him he would have wanted no wives but me , no home but ours . David would have been happiest with one wife and his children growing up around him . But his success prevented that . Once he was king , more marriages were made to strengthen our borders , to finance his great , useless army . Being lord of a harem is wrong for David . With all my heart I pity him . " Amnon rushed at Reba , beating with his fists on her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will not pity David . I will not let you pity David . " Reba took his hands and held them firmly . " My son is wiser than I. David is strong and wise and good . He is the king . He does not need pity . " " You do not love him . " Amnon 's mouth twisted with a strangely unchildlike bitterness . " You love  --  himl " Amnon pointed accusingly at Joab , and Joab thought sadly what incredible conversations a child must overhear in David 's harem . Amnon cried , " I hate you ! I hate you both ! " He ran sobbing down the path and disappeared through the gate into the house . Joab would have gone to bring him back , but Reba held his sleeve . " Amnon gets these  --  impulses  --  and he is better if left alone . He turns from comfort and tortures himself with thoughts I can not understand . " Her wide , dark eyes were raised to Joab 's face . They were filled with tears . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have many sons and spoil them all , as he has spoiled Amnon for six years . Amnon will be one  | among many , and David will overlook him because he is a difficult , moody child . Amnon builds a wall around himself and we who love him can not get through to comfort him . He needs his mother 's love and understanding , but I ca n't comfort him because he knows my secret . " " Your secret ? " " That it is you I love and always have and always will . " " Come with me , Reba . " The words burst from Joab , unplanned . " We will go to Egypt . Or Phoenicia . Or Damascus . Or to the islands of the sea . " " Joab , if only we could . " For a moment only she rested quietly against him . Then she pulled away . " I can never take Amnon away from David . He adores David . I will not rob Amnon of his heritage as David 's firstborn . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joab said , " You do n't love me . " Reba said steadily , " I would rather live with you in a mud hut in the wilderness with Amnon our son and the other sons I could give you , than to live in that lonely house . But I am what I am  --  the wife of David , the mother of Amnon . And you are David 's cousin , and you love him though you may not know it . We are n't children , Joab . We will do what must be done . We will spend our lives serving David . " Joab turned from her , unable to reply . 19 THE GREAT OAK gates to David 's court of judgment stood open daily , guarded by a score of soldiers whose captain was Benaiah the Levite . These soldiers wore short white cloaks with dyed purple girdles and leather breastplates front and back , attached at the shoulders with brazen clasps . They wore greaves of leather on their legs and heavy-soled sandals on their feet . They were armed with swords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten guarded the gate and ten stood beside the wide stone dais on which David sat in judgment . Though a dozen or more men were still employed on the stonework and shrubbery , the pavement and walls were complete . David had been holding court in his own house for three months past . It was here that Joab caught his first glimpse of David the day after he reached Hebron . Staring about at the fine workmanship , Joab reflected with some pride that David 's judgment court was a credit to Judah . David himself was equally impressive . Clearly , David had a gift for the pageantry of kingship . His robe was of linen dyed with the rare Tyrian purple , costliest of all dyes . Six-pointed stars cut from gold cloth were stitched around its hem with gold thread . The robe was of a remarkable  | fullness and fell in heavy folds about the gold-painted leather and cords of his sandals and the gleaming onyx which inlaid his bench and dais . His girdle was of purest bleached linen , with golden threads worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white , though the heads of his workers and bodyguard were bare . Over the headcloth was a chaplet of golden cords fastened with four large red stones called carbuncles . The chaplet with its carbuncles had been the gift of the king of Geshur , father of Maacah and grandfather of the infant Absalom . A similar gem , set in a wide golden ring , ornamented David 's left thumb . Golden bangles clasped his arms below the hem of the wide purple sleeves . In his right hand he held a short staff or wand of office , made of polished cedar wood and decorated at the tip with the golden figure of a lion . God of Gideon , thought Joab . If Zeruiah could see this ! More than the usual daily number of disputes had accumulated during yesterday 's gala celebration of Absalom 's weaning . Joab found an obscure spot in a far corner where he could observe without being conspicuous . David had put on weight since Joab last saw him in Maon , but the blue of his eyes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The look of strain and exhaustion was gone . Yet Joab knew that David was not a happy man . What new quality had crept into his character ? Evasion ? Willingness to compromise ? Or had David merely learned to bend with the wind ? He has become a realist , thought Joab with a thrill of recognition . At last ! David the Dreamer is gone , and David the King replaces him . The man who sat on the onyx-studded bench would not risk his whole destiny by making a march against Nabal for the sake of something as imponderable as a man 's trace of human dignity . This David would hold back from such a march and sing a song about the beauty of forgiveness and the glory of magnanimity . David was a rich man . He had built Nabal 's possessions into enormous holdings . That David had survived many compromises , Joab knew . He had married Nabal 's widow while loving a very young girl whose heart had never opened to him . He had accepted the friendship of Achish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Achish . He had taken to wife a girl whose father was king of Geshur and could help him politically . He had taken other wives for political reasons . This man had come to terms with circumstances . And Joab thought with satisfaction , Zeruiah would approve of David now , more than at any time before . This is a David even I can understand . David 's work as judge was commonplace enough . The elders of Bethlehem tried similar cases and with about as much wisdom . A man whose wife was barren asked for a divorce that he might take a wife who would give him children .  | " Take a second wife , " David said . " But keep the first , since she has nowhere to go if you send her away . " " This I would gladly do , my lord David , " said the man humbly . " But the truth is , I can not feed two wives and the children who will come . " " The wife you now have brought you a dowry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock . Not enough to provide for a household such as ? " " Marry a second wife with a second flock , or one with a vineyard or field . " " But the girl I have chosen ? " " If you can not afford the girl you have chosen without injury to the wife who brought you the means of your present living , choose a girl you can afford . " Crestfallen , the man departed . And Joab thought , he is a practical man , without sentiment . Why then did he keep Reba and Amnon , giving them the protection of husband and father , knowing , as he surely must know , that Amnon was not his son ? A farmer with a dense beard in which black and gray mingled came before David . He was bowing and scraping in a false humility which surely deceived nobody , David least of all . " In my barn are grain and oil and wine . Lately , since the soldiers newly come from Issachar and Asher built their camp nearby , the grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you accuse one of these soldiers of stealing your substance ? " " I accuse all of them , my lord David . " " All ? " " My lord David , all soldiers look alike  --  and smell alike  --  to me . " " You have seen soldiers enter your barn ? " " My lord David , these men are too clever to be caught in the act . But the stocks diminish and everyone knows that soldiers live by pillage and thievery , especially deserters such as ? " David rose . His face was dark with anger . The farmer backed away from the dais . He fumbled his hands together in a supplicating way . " My lord David , I mean no slander against the men who serve you , but the tax I pay for the support of an army which sits idle in its huts  --  I ask only for some rebate on my taxes . I ? " David 's voice was a thunder of anger . " How many years have passed since your barns were raided by Philistines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The man bobbed to punctuate his words and demonstrate his servility . " The greatness of my lord David in protecting Judah is beyond praise . " David shouted , " My men do not rob the people of Judah . Yet if a man among them is robbing you and you bring him before me , with proof from witnesses , he will repay you fourfold . Until you can name a culprit , do not  | slander the men who risk their lives to protect you and safeguard your wealth . Next case ! " Eventually the last dispute was settled . Joab rose from his place in the shadow of the wall and moved toward the dais . David embraced him , unsmiling . " You have been long away , cousin , " said David . " Welcome to Hebron . " His voice was empty of welcome or , indeed , any emotion . A heavy odor of costly ointments clung to David , reminding Joab of the last burial he had attended . David plays at being king , with all the pageantry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder in Hebron by virtue of Abigail 's wealth , and a glorified puppet of Achish of Gath . Joab said , " You live magnificently , David . I wish Zeruiah could see all this splendor . " David 's nod was perfunctory . " Are you in need of protection ? " Joab flushed . " I came to offer my services to you . " It was plain how deeply David hated him . The thought of being hated by David brought sadness to Joab . Reba was right , as always . In spite of everything he loved David . Not because he wanted to but because he could not help himself . David was moving toward the door to his inner quarters , followed by his bodyguard . " Let me consider the matter of your assignment , cousin . Come to the council meeting at sunset . I will assign you to one of my captains if that is your wish . Meanwhile , Benaiah will make you comfortable . " Joab said , " I stayed with Ira last night . I will return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without having once smiled on Joab , David left the hall , walking with an athlete 's grace in golden sandals , while his flowing garments billowed about him . 20 THE HILLS OF Hebron were pocked with caves , many of them storehouses where Ira laid by supplies for the continually expanding army . Ira took Joab on a tour of the caves and the stone warehouses within the walls . He saw bales of cloth and tanned hides , huge earthenware jars filled with olive oil , honey , or cheese . He saw bins filled with wheat and barley from the recent harvest . He saw wine in vats and wine in skins . Dates and figs and raisins filled the air with their rich fragrance .. And west of the city whole valleys were used to pasture David 's camels and donkeys . In spite of all the wealth he saw on every hand , Joab soon realized that morale had never been so low in the wilderness as here in Hebron where David was king . In the wilderness David had shared every hardship with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tents outside the city  | while David lived a soft life in the big house with the pillared court , surrounded by soft-eyed women . His men idled away the years with never a battle to provide the joys of violence and pillage . " We need action , " Ira apologized . " Idleness breeds discontent . Even I am filled with the fever of unrest . I find myself wishing I had never left my wife in Tekoa to follow David . " " Why did you ? " Even in Maon , where nobody asked embarrassing questions , Joab had known that Ira was no outlaw . He followed David from devotion , not from necessity . The sightseeing tour had ended at Ira 's tent , a large new one , and they sat upon the earth , grateful for the shade of the great oak under which the tent had been pitched . Ira said thoughtfully , " I hoped to help David fight his wars because his wars are Judah 's wars . But the only fighting we have done during the past six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two companies suffice . All the while we are subject to Philistines . We have the strength to free ourselves from their rule , to drive them from Judah at least . Yet David sits in his court clothed in purple . He marries wives , begets children . And the army grows larger but remains idle . " Ira had aged during the seven years since Joab last saw him . His shoulders stooped . His body had grown more spare . Joab 's heart was stirred by Ira 's pain and longing . " Why do n't you go home to Tekoa ? " Ira took a stick and traced in the earth the six-pointed star of David . " Here in Hebron we have grown so cynical it shames me to admit I have followed a dream all these years . Yet I know this , friend Joab . If we have no hope in David we have no hope at all . " Joab 's pulses leaped at these words , as they had on a summer morning when Ira first spoke them in his hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of submission to Philistines ? " Ira paced about in the shadow of the great tree . " David is ruled by one purpose  --  to unite Israel . When the men of the northern tribes have had their fill of sending tribute to those Philistine hogs , they will come to David and ask him to be their king . Their young men drift down to David continually . Abner is even more idle than we , having not even raids on Amalekites and Edomites to provide diversion and pillage . A few companies could shatter Abner . But David has sworn an oath never to shed the blood of an Israelite . David 's patience and the rapacity of the Philistines are his weapons , and in the end he will win over Abner if only because he is younger and can better afford to wait . " When the sun set , twenty men , most of them captains , sat on benches or rugs in the court of judgment . Flaming torches in wall brackets cast flickering shadows over the solid stonework and the somber faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his men , dressed as simply as any of them . There was no need to play the king among these captains . The captains of troops stationed in Ziklag and En Gedi and Beersheba were here . The Philistine Ittai , who had deserted Achish to serve David , was present . Seth was also here , to Joab 's surprise . But then Joab knew little of Seth 's comings and goings . Seth , he learned , had arrived two days ago from one of his errands for David . Asa was useful as a messenger , but Seth was a liaison officer , circulating among the camps or moving through the towns of the north or the cities beyond the Jordan . Asa carried messages David formulated , but Seth represented David , giving advice , making decisions , using his discretion and above all , keeping his ears open for any change in sentiment among the tribes still loyal to Abner . The meeting began with a discussion of the tribute . Achish had demanded more oil and wine , instead of cloth and camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchards and vineyards of Judah , while cloth and camels came from desert raids , it was clear that Achish disapproved of Judah 's current prosperity . Ittai spoke . His spare frame and the easy grace of his posture were illuminated by a torch which flamed behind him . Joab looked curiously at this man who had exchanged the luxury of the palace in Gath for a hut in the forest near Hebron . Ittai glanced around with a small half-smile . " May I speak to you of Achish ? " David nodded . " We are attentive to whatever you wish to say . " Ittai said , " I love Achish , but I know his weakness and his fear . Achish is doomed , whereas the star of David is rising . " A murmur went round the circle . Ira said with a smile , " You speak in riddles , friend Ittai . " " I speak of a man who is feared and of another man who is greatly loved . I speak of a man who lives only in the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abiathar , lives in the past , the present , and the future . Circumstances at this moment seem to favor Achish , whereas David is subject to events he can not control . But circumstances change , and so I say that David 's star , which has risen and fallen and risen again , will continue to rise until it reaches the zenith of the world . " There was a stirring among the men . Only David remained sober . And Joab thought how heavy a thing it is to bear the weight of the love , hope , and longing of so many people . It was clear that whether or not David believed in himself , these men believed in him . The words of Ittai touched their ears and their hearts . Ittai waved his hands in a graceful , negligent gesture , as if brushing aside discussion of his remarkable prediction . " We are concerned with the  | tribute . I suggest that Achish could be persuaded to accept the usual tribute if word were to reach him of a skirmish between our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled by every suggestion that an accord may be reached between the two parts of Israel . " David said somberly , " I can not raise a sword against Israel . " Ittai sank down on his rug . Seth rose . He was a huge man and his robe made him seem even more imposing than God had made him . He folded his arms across his great chest . " We are balanced dangerously between Philistines and Israelites , so that we seem to be friends with one and enemies with the other . We long to be allied with Israel in order to turn our united strength against the enemy who bleeds us year by year . " A murmur went round the circle . Seth was surely speaking for all . He went on earnestly , " It is not Israel that is our enemy . It is Abner . Ishbosheth is nothing . Abner prevents him from renouncing the throne . The elders of the north look to Abner . I suggest therefore a maneuver which will so discredit Abner that not only the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we send an army marching through their cities  --  a small army ? a show of strength . Three or four companies would be enough to show that we are not afraid to appear armed among their Philistine garrisons . " A smile lighted David 's somber face . " To win their hearts , without shedding their blood ! " His blue eyes gleamed in the torchlight . " How I have yearned to go to Benjamin , to the tabernacle at Gibeon , to worship the Lord ! " From the dismay on Seth 's face Joab knew he had not expected David to give his suggestion such a twist . The tabernacle had been removed from Nob after the massacre of the priests . It had been set up farther north in Gibeon , a city of Benjamin . The priest Zadok  --  who like Abiathar was descended from Aaron , but by another line  --  had been made high priest in the tabernacle . David rose , smiling . " I will send an offering to the tabernacle . I will send it by a kinsman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in mind . A band of soldiers , to demonstrate in the village squares or before the city gates ? " David continued as if there had been no interruption . " I will send one company of picked men , and with them a donkey train led by Ira . " Abiathar had sat apart brooding until now . He said , frowning , " What kind of offering is brought to the Lord by armed men ? " David said resolutely , " Each soldier will bring his own offering . When they have made their sacrifice to the Lord , they will march on through the provinces . Ira will return with the donkeys to Hebron , but the soldiers will march as you suggest , Seth . " Abiathar said gravely , " The plan is of the Lord . " He returned to his brooding , and Joab reflected with approval that Abiathar was above rivalry ,  | even when gifts were to be sent to the man named by Saul to succeed Abiathar 's murdered father . Seth cried in anguish , " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David said reasonably , " If we send more than a single company , we rouse both the Philistine garrisons and the soldiers of Abner against us . If there is to be any virtue in such a march , it must be made by a single company . " Joab understood : Seth 's hope had been to arouse Abner to attack and to wipe him out with his three or four companies . But David saw through the ruse and circumvented it with perfect amiability . Ittai said , " Achish would construe the march as unfriendly to Abner . Achish would be pleased . " David said , " The march must be led by a kinsman , since I can not go . " " Not by me ! " shouted Seth . " I will not lead one company ! Four , yes . But not one ! " " Not by you , " David agreed pleasantly . " You must go ahead and prepare the way . Make sure the elders in the towns understand it as an act of courage , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trumpet for the march . " His lips curved in a strangely gentle smile . The eyes he turned on Joab were warm and kind but challenging . Joab stumbled to his feet . " I have never in my whole life fought a single battle ! I have never commanded anything but a donkey train . " " I have not ordered a battle . I have ordered a march . " " Let me march , then . Let someone else command . " " Do you refuse the commission , cousin ? " If I refuse , thought Joab miserably , I will have to go running home to Bethlehem and never trouble him again . But if I march and there is a battle and I am killed  --  either way , he wins . Except if there is a battle and by some miracle I destroy Abner  --  why then David still wins . We all win , he thought , and for the first time felt himself a part of this assembly . He bowed without taking his eyes from David 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I will lead the march . " And with the words he felt suddenly years older and inches taller . David 's blue eyes held a brief gleam of respect and pleasure . Then he became cool and practical . " Raise your company , cousin . If one company is not enough , take fifty archers also . Choose only men of Judah . The expedition loses its significance if men from the other tribes go with you . Let each man take his own offering as evidence that Judah serves the Lord of Israel as do the northern tribes . When the sacrifices have been made , march on through the other cities . Benaiah will help you select and drill your men . Ira will attend to your supplies . Seth will go ahead and prepare the way . What else do you require , cousin ? "  | Joab glanced at the scarred face of Benaiah , the broad , sun-reddened face of Seth , the swarthy face of Ittai in its frame of silky beard . Ira 's heavy lids concealed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desperate chance we take , thought Joab . If I fail and survive , I can return to Bethlehem and it will be none the worse for me . I have less to lose in this venture than these others . He looked directly at David , smiling . " If there is anything else I need , I will send you word . " In the days that followed Joab worked day and night , choosing his men and drilling them , planning with Seth the line of march , discussing with Ira the provisioning . The words of Ira were often in his mind . If we have a hope , it is in David . " We " was more than Hebron , more than Judah . " We " was all Israel , now lying impoverished under the rule of Philistines . If I fight Abner for David and destroy him , David will surely become king of a united Israel , he thought . After that perhaps we can forget what has happened between us . By day Joab worked with the others , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , planning , rejecting , and planning again . I will find a way , he told himself over and over . If David could destroy Goliath , I can win a battle with my picked soldiers . At last Joab found a plan which would give him and his men a chance . We will win , he thought , because we must . We will win in the name of the God of David , who is also the God of Israel . Now he understood the meaning of David 's choosing him . We can not undo the harm we have done one another , he imagined David as saying . Our personal affairs have become tangled beyond repair . But I give you another gift , cousin . I give you the opportunity to serve our people . I give you the opportunity to prove yourself , to do for Israel the thing I am not free to do . Do not fail me , cousin . Do not fail yourself . Do not fail your people . I will lift up my eyes unto the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David 's songs . The hills around Bethlehem had closed him in for most of the twenty-four years of his life . I will lift up my eyes now unto the hills of Benjamin , he thought . I will take upon my shoulders the burden of this encounter with Abner , that veteran of many battles . The peace and prosperity of Israel have been placed in my hands by David . If the task is too great for me , he thought , surely the God of David will come to my aid . He sent to Bethlehem for young Asa , wishing him to have a part in his preparations . Seth had suggested the original plan . Joab would lead the march . It was right that the third son of Zeruiah should also play a role  | in the event . Joab had , indeed , been wondering for several days what was keeping Asa in Bethlehem . Obed the Reubenite returned from Bethlehem bringing word that Asa would be delayed for two more days . Asa , Obed reported , was taking a wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bridegroom in his behalf . The news struck upon Joab 's ears with a fearful sense of foreboding . Asa the impetuous was a perfect dupe to serve Lisha 's purposes . Who but Lisha could rush Asa into a hasty marriage lest some general family alarm interfere with her design ? Joab left his painstaking preparations in the hands of Ira and Benaiah and set out that same evening for Bethlehem . If the bride was indeed Lisha , he meant to try to prevent the marriage . I should have told Zeruiah all I knew about that girl , he thought in an anguish of self-blame . I should have foreseen that Lisha would find a way to get at my brother , having failed with me . The first miles were covered at a desperation pace . Then Joab began to wonder how one goes about telling a beloved younger brother that he has played the fool . He was exhausted by that time , from haste as well as anxiety . And now as he continued north he began to ponder subtler ways of dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding until after we have fought this battle with Abner , thought Joab . Joab reached Bethlehem late at night , and did not awaken till the sun was beating directly down upon him . By the time he had joined the family in the courtyard , Asa had already gone to wait at the gate with the elders , and Lisha with her train of maidens was ready to start . His suspicions were confirmed . But it was too late . He was quickly pressed into service as friend of the bridegroom . Heartsick , he had to join in the festivities which made Lisha a member of the family of Zeruiah , bride of bewildered Asa. 2I WHEN SAUL MOVED the tabernacle from the desecrated town of Nob after the massacre of Abiathar 's family , it was natural to bring it to Gibeon in Benjamin . The Hebrews had made it a city of priests . The town of Gibeon was celebrated for many things , chief among them its pool . Fed by eternal springs , the pool lay cool and deep , reflecting the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the solid rock , as had a circular staircase . This staircase with its handrail made it easier for the women to reach the water supply when it receded in the dry season . The tabernacle was set on a hill overlooking the pool and the low gray  | houses of the town . Zadok , descended from Aaron through the third son . Eleazar , lived beside the court of the tabernacle and offered sacrifices on the brazen altar . Israel 's tabernacle embraced almost four centuries of Hebrew history in its tattered curtains . It was made , so the legend went , in the shadow of Mount Sinai from specifications given to Moses by the Lord God . Into the tabernacle went the most precious possessions of a people newly emerged from slavery  --  treasures of gold and jewels , linens and wool , silver and brass , oil and spices were brought as gifts . The finest artisans gave their labor to fashion a house of the Lord which could be transported when the people moved and set up when they camped . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty archers . They left Hebron at dawn , marching in ranks of ten followed by Ira and his donkeys with their drivers , and with a flock of sacrificial sheep bleating behind . The men bypassed Jerusalem and spent the night in the fields near Gibeon . They paused next morning at the pool to wash and refresh themselves and to refill their water bottles . Then , trailed all the way by chattering urchins , they marched toward the tabernacle on the hilltop and up the steps of the tabernacle court . The paved court , worn smooth by the sandals of worshipers , faced east as did the open end of the tabernacle . Near the tent of meeting stood a great brazen altar , high as a man 's shoulders , and hollow . Within the altar a perpetual fire sent smoke in a thin , pale thread against the blue of the sky , while beyond the altar was the basin where priests washed themselves after the sacrifice . Inside the sanctuary stood the table bearing the plate of shewbread with its linen napkin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old embroidery hung on the Veil that formed the back wall of the sanctuary . Beyond the Veil was the Holy of Holies , where once the sacred ark had rested . The tabernacle was not large , and the wood of its walls was so shrunken that linen billowed through the wide cracks . Fresh skins and camel's-hair cloth had reinforced the roof . For the tent of the Lord had known the ravages of the centuries , and four hundred years is a long time for a tent to endure . Joab looked now at the altar , the tabernacle , and the Veil , and remembered that Moses had stood within these curtains . Here to this altar generations of Hebrews had brought their offerings . This was the shrine holy to all Israel . I have come to this place , thought Joab , wearing the trumpet of command . Ahead of me lies the battle which may unite this nation at last . If ever I am going to pray to the God of Israel , now is the time and this the place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been polishing the brass  | corner post with its tapering horn , when the noises of men and animals interrupted him . He squatted there now , staring with open mouth . Joab said briskly , " Are you the priest Zadok ? " A foolish question . The fellow was as slack-jawed as Lem had been . " I am a doorkeeper in the house of the Lord , " said the man , meaning it was his duty to open the tabernacle doors by day and close them by night , to polish the brass , sweep the pavement , cart away the ashes , and mop up the blood . " Will you fetch the priest ? " The Levite dropped his sponge and scuttled out of the court by a side gate . Nearby stood a house of stone with neatly timbered roof . " Zadok ! " cried the Levite as he ran . " Zadok ! Sir ! " The door of the house opened . A woman looked out . Her eyes went wide and she ducked back into the house quickly , closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Levite , " Tell them to wait  --  Zadok will come . Only a moment . " Zadok did come in a moment , looking as if he might have spent an hour grooming himself for the occasion . His curling black beard gleamed with oil . His sleeveless linen cloak was a marvel of neatness , and Joab thought if Reba were to see it she would not rest until she had made one of just that cut and drape to cover the lank frame of Abiathar . The priest 's blue girdle had been carefully folded and twined about his slender , graceful body . His headcloth was of the same blue , and a silver chaplet held it firmly atop the mass of black hair falling to his shoulders . Zadok came briskly across the paved court . That he knew who his visitors were Joab had no doubt , for Seth had come through Gibeon ten days ago to speak of David 's intention . He took Joab into a formal embrace . " I , Zadok , priest of the Lord , welcome you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this holy tabernacle . " There was a pleasant odor of spiced oil upon the priest . Zadok greeted Ira and Asa , then turned to the body of men and spread his arms . " Blessed are you of the Lord , " he cried in a firm , strong voice which reached to the farthest donkey driver , " because you have come with your gifts to worship the Lord in His holy tabernacle . " Joab recalled that Zadok 's descent from Aaron was as authentic as was Abiathar 's , though in Zadok 's line there had been no memorable priests while in Abiathar 's there had been several , including Eli . Joab knew that in this tabernacle , denuded of the ark and also of the Urim and Thummim , service surely became a thing of form and appearance , lacking the core of holiness . He wondered whether Zadok , unlike Abiathar , might be a man to whom form and appearance were perhaps sufficient . Joab bowed before this priest who looked the part of a priest . " We are  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offerings of David , who is our king . " Zadok said warmly , " How does David prosper in Judah ? " " He prospers . As well as a man can who pays tribute to Philistines . " Zadok 's dark eyes wandered to the offering . " He prospers , " murmured Zadok . " Israel does not prosper . " Remembering that priests are fed by a set share of the offerings , Joab wondered whether Zadok saw on the hoof today the fat pieces to be burned to the Lord , or the joints and cutlets to grace the tables of the priesthood . Yet he could not smile at the poverty of Israel 's priests . Zadok said , " I will call servants to pen the animals and dispose of the other offerings until the hour of sunset . You will want to rest during the heat of the day . When you hear the sound of the ram 's horn , it will be time to return for the ceremonies . " Joab bowed , and marched briskly down the steps with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving smartly . They returned to the pool and rested in the shadow of the great rock , and ate their provisions of fruits and bread , happy that tonight they would share a feast to the Lord . While the men rested , Joab took Asa and went to examine the terrain about the pool . He still had to complete his plan , adapting it to the terrain , for it was here within a few days that a battle with Abner would take place . Joab dreaded taking Asa into battle . The boy 's mood had been one of bravado mixed with desperation ever since he came back to Hebron . Joab had tried to persuade him not to make the march . " Return to your bride , " he had urged . But Asa had looked at him with pain in his bewildered young eyes . " I must get away , " he said desperately . " If I ca n't go with you I  --  I 'll  --  I ' 11 run away to Egypt . " Today Asa was silent and brooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men , nor share Joab 's absorption in plans for the battle . Asa had long been a prime object of Joab 's love and protection . Now they were going into battle  --  the first battle either had ever fought  --  and Joab carried in his heart the guilty sense that Lisha had married Asa partly to revenge herself on him . He wished the boy would either unburden his mind or turn it to thoughts of the battle . Presently Asa expelled a gusty sigh . " What a wife I have married , brother Joab , " he said . " We live and learn . Let me tell you this  --  it is sometimes necessary for a man to escape from home to get his rest and find a little peace . The love that girl has for me is a bottomless well , and I do not think I will live to fill it . " Joab said uncomfortably , " When she has borne a few sons her hunger will abate . " But he thought angrily , I should have killed her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done so .  | Asa looked at Joab with admiration . " I tell you , Joab , I never planned to marry that girl . I do n't know how it came about . But there was a hot night when she came to the rooftop where I slept and ? Well then , it serves me right for getting mixed up with a Moabitess . " Joab exclaimed , " Do n't talk like a fool . Our ancestress Ruth was a Moabitess . Many of the men of our family have married women from Moab . Lisha is  --  Lisha . There are such women in every race and tribe . " He put his arm around Asa 's shoulder . " Never mind . You shall divorce her . " But he knew even while he said it that neither Zeruiah nor Eliab was likely to permit Asa to divorce Lisha and leave her to run wild among the shepherds of Bethlehem . Joab said , " War is the best cure for domestic problems . Soon we will meet Abner and destroy him . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a round of wars such as these hills have never seen , until our neighbors on every side are paying us tribute . We will be the greatest power between Egypt and the three rivers . When that is done , you will be such a man and such a hero that you can govern your wife . " Asa smiled a little at last . " Indeed , I am not in such trouble as I thought . Things will be better tomorrow . But first , we must destroy Abner . " During the afternoon Zadok came over the hill and sat on the grass beside them . " Tell me , " he said , " how the men of Hebron celebrate the Passover and Pentecost and the Harvest Feast . " Joab said , " We celebrate the great feasts like the lesser feasts , at our own altar in our own town . When we have no priests , the elders preside . My grandfather Jesse used to preside in Bethlehem . Now my oldest cousin Eliab presides . " " In Hebron , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very ancient . It is said that Abraham built the altar ten centuries ago . " Zadok said sadly , " Every town has its altar , built on a hill as the natives of the land build their high places . " Ira said , " It is better to worship each in his own town than not to worship the Lord at all . " " How easily , " said Zadok , " we content ourselves with what is good and forego what is better . Israel will be a people of parts and sections as long as the glory of the tabernacle is in eclipse , for the tabernacle is the source of Hebrew unity . " Ira nodded . " That is true . We are a scattered people . Yet we serve one God and keep one law . " " I pray , " said Zadok earnestly , " that a time will come when the ark will be restored to the tabernacle and all Israel will bring gifts to this shrine . It can not come about until Israel has one king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Abner , has been put down . This I would not say among Benjamites , since the priest of the Lord is the priest of  | all the people . Yet among the priests it is said that if in Israel there is one man capable of bringing together all the people and turning their hearts again to the service of the Lord at one holy shrine , David is the man . David is a man of piety and vision . " " He is a man of piety , all right , " Joab said . " But long disappointment can blunt the vision . " " Has David ceased to hope for unity in Israel ? " " No , " said Ira . " He has not . " " Is it true that the prophet Samuel once anointed David with oil ? " " It is true , " Joab said . " It happened when I was very young , and I do not exactly remember it , but my mother has spoken of it so often I almost feel as if I recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jesse , and David himself . " Zadok rose . He looked pleased with the things he had heard . " This anointing is something the priests of Israel should be told about again and again , until there is no priest in all the north who does not know the story . The priests will tell the story to the elders . One obstacle remains , and that is Abner . As long as he moves among the people in the name of Saul , the priests can do little except talk . " He gave Joab a quick measuring glance . " It is sometimes necessary to do evil that good may follow . Do you agree ? " Joab nodded . He understood perfectly . No prayer at the brazen altar , no benediction offered by a priest in full regalia could have moved him so profoundly as this unspoken benediction on the battle he had planned . The Lord is on our side , he thought . I will not fear the battle . Such words were not hollow when David spoke them . Joab 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not sorry to be told that the Lord was on his side . Zadok said briskly , " Well now , it is time to prepare for the evening 's ceremonies . When you hear the sound of the ram 's horn ? " Joab nodded . " We will come . " 22 JOAB 's MEN SLEPT that night on the west side of the pool . Close by them , the spiral staircase led to the water which , at this season , was down a dozen feet or more . They rested there all the next day , wrestling and playing at dice and the other games soldiers invent to while away the hours of waiting which , more than battle and marching , make up army life . Joab rested with his men . His plans were complete , his orders given . Spies had come to report that Abner was marching to Gibeon before the next Sabbath . He would have six or eight companies with him . Well then ,  | Joab 's men were outnumbered five or six to one , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abner would come expecting to be first at the pool , since he had been wrongly informed as to the time of Joab 's march . Abner would expect to have the initiative because of David 's long record of refusing to shed Israelite blood . By tactics of surprise , Joab expected to overcome Abner 's numerical advantage . Abner came the third day . Just as the heat of the day was beginning , he and his men appeared at the top of the hill , intent on the water below them . Their first view of Joab 's men was the reflection they saw in the water . They raised their eyes to the men themselves , and their mouths fell open as they recognized the men of Judah , armed and waiting , here in their Benjamite land . Behind them others crowded over the hill , cursing them for blocking the approach to the water . Abner stood on the bank . His gray beard was filmed with dust . His legs were covered with dust down which rivers of sweat had run . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and shook his head , as if hoping what he saw would go away . Then he called , " Who makes free with the pool of Gibeon in Benjamin ? " " Joab , son of David 's sister , has brought these few men of Judah to Gibeon 's tabernacle with offerings for the Lord . " " Are there no altars in Judah ? " " There is only one tabernacle . David sent gifts to Zadok , high priest of Israel . " Abner 's jaws tensed with anger . He had expected to intercept David 's emissaries before the gifts were given . He well knew how such an act of piety on David 's part could undermine his own prestige . But he was too late . He had made the long , hot journey to no purpose . He growled , " You came in peace ? " " Did David ever approach the men of Israel except in peace ? " Abner nodded grudgingly . " My men , " he said , " are hot and thirsty . Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles from the pool ? " Joab replied boldly . " We also thirst . Let your men draw back to the brow of the hill until we have drunk from the pool and filled our bottles so that we may start our journey back to Hebron . " Incensed at this haggling , Abner roared , " Let your men draw back first , for they are fresh while my men have marched since dawn . " Joab said , " We reached the pool first . We will drink first . " Silent now , the men on both sides of the pool stood firm . Finally Abner shouted in exasperation , " Let the young men wrestle to determine who will drink first . " " Your men outnumber us five to one . "  | " Choose twelve of your men . Twelve of the young men of Benjamin will meet them to try their strength and skill . " It was a device as old as the hills around the pool of Gibeon , and it was the device Joab had counted on . For one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in the Valley of Elah , was equally honorable but it would not have suited Joab 's plans at all . Joab beckoned to the ten men in the first rank , and to two in the second . Abner cried , " First let my twelve men slake their thirst . " Joab said , " The young men of Judah will also slake their thirst . " He did not stir from his place beside the water . Abner turned toward the horde which crowded thickly behind him . " Volunteers , " he shouted angrily . " Twelve men . " From among those who moved out , Abner chose twelve . Joab 's men were already trotting around the pool to meet the opposing champions . The rest of the swordsmen moved behind the twelve , emptying the space in front of the archers . But Abner 's men did not appear to notice this maneuver . They felt themselves quite secure because of David 's known policy . Their attention was all on their wrestlers . The twelve Benjamites advanced , arms extended for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding their pose until they were almost at grips , when they whipped out their swords and plunged them into the bellies of the unsuspecting Benjamites . Before the screams had formed in the throats of the dying men , the attackers had rushed upon another twelve , while those behind them crowded past to join the fray . Meanwhile the archers had a clear range . Arrows flew across the water , striking men who stood so close together they had not even room to fall . And the screams of the wounded rose so loud that Abner 's commands went unheard . When the archers could no longer distinguish Benjamites from their own men , they dropped their bows and rushed around the pool , swords upraised . Before the men of Abner had disentangled themselves , Joab 's men had slain more than two hundred . Some had already begun to run . The panic spread , and the thirsty , exhausted army fled from Gibeon , heading back the way they had come . The first man on whom Joab seized was a bearded Bedouin from beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sword when Joab 's knife plunged through the sweat-streaked cloak into the flesh . The man fell without a sound , but the consternation on his face brought an exultant shout to Joab 's lips . " For David and the God of Israel ! " shouted Joab . He was too busy defending himself from the Bedouin 's neighbor to look back on the streaming blood his sword had drawn . The noise of shouting , the screams of the wounded , the turmoil of struggling bodies and clashing metal blurred the  | senses , so that Joab hardly knew the difference between the moments when his thrust went home and the moments when he was parrying a blow . When blood appeared on his sleeve he did not know whether it was his own or another man 's . One moment in all that turmoil stood out for him , and that was when one of those he struck cried out , " God of Israel , " as he fell . In that moment Joab knew the sick meaning of striking down men who swear by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We bring our gifts to the same tabernacle . A sword ripped his cloak . The searing stroke of a blade at his shoulder brought Joab back to a sense of the hazard and challenge of the moment . He whirled , thrust his sword into the man 's belly and with a strong turn of the wrist disemboweled him . The man gathered his entrails in his arms as he dropped to his knees , screaming . Now Joab saw that the men of Benjamin were in flight . We have won , he thought exultantly . I have won ! My stratagem has triumphed ! It did not occur to him just then to assign any of the credit to the Lord in whose name Zadok had blessed his men . He thought only , We have defeated Abner and his army though they far outnumbered us . Now I am indeed a soldier and a leader of men . Joab had been too busy fighting to remember the trumpet which hung at his neck . Now he raised the trumpet and sounded the pursuit . " For David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shout was taken up by his men until it was a roar following after the fleeing army . Already Ira and his muleteers had begun the work assigned to them ? to dispatch the wounded and plunder the slain . Joab passed by Ira at his work , and Ira shouted , " God speed you , boy . David and all Judah will love you for this day 's work . " Through the long , hot afternoon Joab 's men had the advantage of freshness , but the Benjamites knew the lay of the land , and were able to lead pursuers into many a blind alley and there elude them . This knowledge saved many Benjamites that day . The lust of battle is like a sickness , yet even a sickness runs its course . Long before the sun set , Joab was filled with abhorrence for the stench of spilled blood and the sight of his gory sword . There was no longer the exhilarating sense of power at the moment of the kill . Most of all he longed to shut out the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David is right , he told himself , and he knew he would never again shed Israelite blood if he could by any means avoid it . The shadows were long and the breeze from the east was no longer hot . Joab found himself lost in a narrow , winding ravine into which he had been led by a pair of fleeing Benjamites . Now the men were gone and he turned back . He saw a saddle in the ridge on his left and began  | to climb toward it , hoping the next valley would be the main route followed by the fleeing soldiers . It was important , he remembered belatedly , for a commander to remain with his men , not go off on a mission of his own . He was halfway up the slope when he heard from the next valley a deep voice heavy with exhaustion . " Leave me , boy . Go back and plunder among the slain . " The answering voice was shrill with excitement . " So this is the courage of the mighty Abner ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your comrades . " He leaped up the slope , knowing he would be too late to save Asa from the mighty sword of the veteran commander . How well he knew the boy 's zeal and Zeruiah 's complaint , " His eagerness outruns his judgment . " Joab was crossing the ridge when he heard his brother 's shrill scream . He scrambled down the slope , fell and rolled into some bushes , jumped up and leaped over boulders and plunged on . At the base of the hill he could see the writhing figure and around it the spreading pool of blood . He fell again in his haste , regained his footing and rushed on . Abner was out of sight over the next ridge . By the time Joab reached Asa 's body , it was still . While Benjamites streamed up the valley , he made no move to bring his men against them . He heard the sound of a horn , and when he looked he saw the silhouette of a tattered figure , horn at lips , on a crag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered men to him on that mountain . The stream of Benjamites turned and disappeared , and their pursuers paused to cluster around Joab , staring down at Asa in consternation . Until this moment the slaughter had seemed to them one-sided . One of the men took Asa 's cloak and wrapped it round him , concealing the great wound in the belly , though blood still seeped out through the garment . Joab now shouted , " After them , for David and the God of Judah ! And for Asa , who is dead . We will surround their mountain and destroy them , root and branch . " He raised his trumpet . With tears streaming down his dusty face he sounded the pursuit . They would charge into the very teeth of the enemy , up the very walls of the natural stronghold where Abner 's men had gathered to make a stand . But when they reached the hill they found that two sides were too steep to scale , and the Benjamites were so thick on the other two sides that to attack would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long will brother pursue brother ? Are n't we all men of Israel ? " Men of Israel , thought Joab dully . Brothers . These men are my brothers , as Asa was my brother . And the heart went out of him utterly .  | He raised the trumpet to his lips for the last time that day , sounding the recall . Then he led the way back to where Asa lay . Ira was running up the valley . " We have triumphed gloriously , " cried Ira , embracing Joab . " Three hundred sixty-five of the enemy are dead in their blood , in Gibeon and along the way . But of our own men only nineteen are slain . " " Twenty , " said Joab . He took up Asa 's slight body in his arms and carried it down the valley till he came to where Ira had tethered the donkeys . Ira swept the burden off one small beast , and Joab laid the body of his brother across it . " We will take him to Bethlehem , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomb of Jesse .

Every day I will be with David and see his beautiful clothes and his kind blue eyes . Every day David will see me and touch me . In the harem David did not always see Amnon , since that great box of noise  --  that Absalom  --  entered the house . David would come striding into the harem with his robes swishing about his golden sandals , and his eyes slid right past Amnon to Absalom . When the boy ran forward , David seized him and tossed him into the air , laughing at his delighted cries . I do not laugh , thought Amnon . Dinah has said so and it is true . These other people laugh so much . Why am I different ? Pain was in Amnon 's heart . Then he heard the bird again and stared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big oak tree that hung over the wall . He saw the small brown bird . It sang as if it owned the tree and the courtyard and the sky . Amnon remembered that his mother had said , " The plainest birds sing the sweetest songs . " Amnon was comforted a little , remembering the words . He blinked away the babyish tears which plagued him so often and shamed him so deeply .  | I will never see Absalom in those other rooms , he thought . Absalom will not be seven for a long , long time . I am the eldest , the first-born . Today I leave these talky women and that fat , laughing boy , and the rest of these squalling babies . Today I am no longer the son of my mother . I am the son of David . Doubt was sharp in his chest again , as always when he thought of himself in that way . David is my father ! That other man , the man I hate , the man who brings gladness into the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinah was lying when she told Maacah he was my father and not David . She said it because she hates my mother . David is my father ! Today I will have breakfast with him , and sit at the edge of the dais while he gives judgment . Tonight I will sleep in a room near his room . Amnon walked softly across the deserted court to the room with the great stone water jars . He poured water into a basin , spilling only a little , and carried the basin to the room he shared with his mother . He stripped off the scanty shirt and loincloth which are worn by children while they are very young . He washed himself all over and put on a clean tunic from the pile of garments which lay on a shelf , ready to be taken to his new room . His mother had made all these things for him . They were clothes such as men wear . Amnon put on the fine linen cloak . There were dyed girdles to choose from . He chose a scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He would always dress himself from now on , and David would be pleased with him if he managed to do everything neatly and smoothly . When he looked up from his labor he saw that his mother was awake and watching him . " My son , " she whispered . Her eyes were bright with tears . She reached to pull him to her . " Oh , my baby , " she whispered . Amnon stood as tall as he could , sucking in his stomach to make his chest big . He could not bear to look at his mother just then . Having a room all your own to which your mother does not come is a lonely thing to think of . He would go to his bed tonight and she would not be there to put her arms around him . If he dreamed , as he often did , and waked up sobbing and terribly afraid , she wouldmot be there to comfort him . Nobody would comfort him . He turned toward the window and stared out at the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go ? " " Will you wait and eat breakfast with me , my son ? " " David promised I could eat breakfast with him . " Amnon jutted his chin . If his mother was hurt it did not matter . She did not love David . Amnon wished he could go right this minute . Women turn a boy 's heart to water . Every boy must go away to live among men . Still , he could visit her every day if he liked . If he had nothing better to do . Amnon said , " I will have breakfast with you sometimes . But not today . "  | That is the way men talk to women . They are firm and sometimes rough . They do not cry and they do not plead . Well , not often . David had cried , one night . Amnon had heard , when they thought he was asleep . David had pleaded , " You do not love me . " " All women love you , " his mother had replied , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " David had said sadly . " Not you . " Amnon wished he had not waked up that night to hear secret talk not meant for him . His mother now said , " Of course you will have breakfast with me sometimes . Comb out your hair , and you can go at once . " Amnon wiped his hand roughly over his wet cheeks and flung himself suddenly against his mother 's breast . How warm she was . Soft and warm . " Mother , " he whispered , pressing his wet cheek against her neck , " I love you , Mother . " David had not forgotten that Amnon was coming to share his morning cakes and wine . He was wearing a beautiful golden cloak with scarlet stars around the hem . A white and gold girdle was wrapped around him with the special smooth perfection his clothing always had . Amnon was so busy staring he could hardly remember the food on his plate . David was finished before Amnon had eaten even one cake . David rumpled the boy 's hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on your plate , my man , and then you shall come with me to review the soldiers . " Amnon lost no time clearing his plate after that . To review the soldiers with David ! That was honor ! What can possibly happen in a harem to compare with standing beside David to review the soldiers ? But David did not review the soldiers after all . When Amnon had swallowed his cup of goat 's milk and had finished the cluster of raisins which took so long because of the seeds , he found David on his bench of judgment . He was talking to a man whose beard was a great , gray bush upon his breast . He went close and waited to be noticed . But David was busy talking , so Amnon sat on the dais to listen . David looked very strange . What had happened to his face ? Suddenly Amnon knew . David was happy ! He was happy enough to burst . Amnon had learned very young to read the passions , the disappointments , the hunger and resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house in Hebron . But he had seldom seen this kind of happiness in anyone 's face , unless perhaps in his mother 's face when that man had come into the courtyard . There was a woman on a nearby bench . She was pretty but she was  | not the cause of David 's happiness . Amnon had seen him with many pretty women and they did not bring this look to his face . Amnon remembered something his mother had said a long time ago . " There is one thing David really , truly wants . That is to be king of Israel . Not just king of Judah , but of Reuben , Simeon , Dan , Asher , Gad , Naphtali , Manasseh , Ephraim , Benjamin , Issachar , and Zebulun . " Amnon had watched David as he spoke smilingly with the women in the harem . David loved them all . His mother had said so . But David had never looked then as he looked now . David was happy because of what the man was saying . And the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deep and heavy but it was not happy . The man was saying that he had quarreled with another man . Suddenly Amnon was really listening to what the man was saying , because he knew who he was . This was Abner , and Ishbosheth was the man Abner had quarreled with . Abner wanted to be David 's friend and make David king of Israel . The tall priest was here  --  Abiathar . Abiathar wore his look of thunder , which meant he did not think the Lord was pleased with what Abner was saying to David . Abiathar saw , just as Amnon did , that Abner did not really love David but pretended he did because he had quarreled with Ishbosheth and he could not get along without some king for a friend . Abner talked and talked , and the woman looked tired and unhappy , and Amnon thought if his mother were here she would take the woman to a room where she could rest . The names of the tribes were rolling from Abner 's lips . The words were like music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray beard like stones dropping on a wooden floor . The names were spoken arrogantly , as if all the people of Dan , Asher , Gad , Naphtali , and the others belonged to Abner . Abner boasted about how many friends he had and how his friends would be David 's friends and would make David their king instead of Ishbosheth if Abner told them to . Presently David said , " You are a man who has had a full life . It is well that you are ready to rest at last , friend Abner . " Abner 's eyes grew very dark and angry , and he said , " I will not rest as long as there is a Philistine left in our hills . I will serve my lord David as I served my lord Saul . I will fight the enemies of my people while there is breath in my body . " Amnon thought this was a strange thing for Abner to say , because he had heard both his mother and Joab saying Abner did not lift a hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . A shadow crossed David 's face . But his smile was just as friendly as could be . He held out his arms to give Abner the embrace friends give at parting . " Then you shall march with me and command my army and your own ,  | friend Abner , " David said . " You shall be my commander , as you were Saul 's . For I know well that there is no better soldier in Israel . " The man with the beard was gone . David turned to the woman . He said in a kind , happy voice , " Well , Michal , welcome to Hebron and to my home . " The woman did not smile . She said , " So I am the price you pay to inherit my father 's throne . " " You are my wife , Michal . It is right that you live with me . " " I am the wife of Phaltiel . " " Saul gave you first to me . Remember that time , Michal ? Remember how your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philistines ? He thought I would be killed . " The woman 's eyes grew filmy and she shuddered . " I thought so , too . " David smiled and stepped down from the dais and moved toward the woman . " But I was n't killed . I returned with twice the price Saul asked . And we were married . Michal , Michal , how young we were and how happy . You do remember , do n't you ? " She stood up suddenly and David put his arms around her , but she turned away . Then David led her to another room . They were looking only at each other and did not notice that Amnon followed them . They sat close together on a rug in the room and Michal 's face had a tortured look on it . " You could have taken me to the wilderness when you fled . " " To live in the holes that sheltered me ? " " You took other wives in the wilderness . " " But not at first . Not until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents , weapons , booty from raids , and bounty from the sheiks . " " Now you have many wives . I am to be one of many wives and live in the harem of King David because I am Saul 's daughter and can strengthen his claim to Saul 's throne . " " Michal , do n't torture yourself . You were the first . You were the first for me . I was the first for you . " " But not the last . David , I have learned what it is to be deeply , honestly loved . Do you know that Phaltiel followed me , weeping , all the long miles to Judah ? " David said gently , " We must forget all that , Michal . I have lived for the day when Israel could be one people . Let 's not weep for what is lost , but rejoice for all the good that will come . " Michal said , " You left me without a backward glance . Phaltiel would never have done that . You sent not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fared badly , believe me . Michal , do you know what it means to me to be able to unite Israel ? " " It is what you want . At any price . "
