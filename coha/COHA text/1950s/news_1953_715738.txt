txt Governor Dewey declared yesterday he was " impressed and delighted " with the way the New York-New Jersey waterfront commission was tackling its " monumental " job of driving crime from the docks . He voiced his praise after spending an hour and fifteen minutes with the two commission members , Lieut . Gen. George P. Hays of New York and Maj. Gen. Edward C. Rose of New Jersey , in the Governor 's suite at the Roosevelt Hotel . In a joint news conference , the Governor and the two men charged with responsibility for cleaning up the port - made it clear that the commission still was in the preparatory phase of its task . The two generals , one of whom was appointed Aug. 20 and the other eight days later , still have no office , no staff and no decision on how many waterfront employment centers they will open , where they will be or who will run them . In the meantime , John J. ( Gene ) Sampson , who was ousted several weeks ago as business agent Of Local 791 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was reinstated last night at a closed meeting of the local 's membership . Mr. Sampson ; who is the brother of Frank Sampson , an assistant to Mayor Impellitteri , had been removed on charges that he had violated union // rules by making unauthorized statements to the press . After Dec. 1 it will be illegal for any longshoreman to work on New York or New Jersey piers unless he has registered with the commission and been cleared for employment . The same deadline applies for the licensing of stevedoring concerns and pier watchmen , the abolition of the shape-up and the elimination of public loaders . The Governor showed little disposition to let the commissioners make commitments on how fast they would get their operation under way . In response to a question about when the employment centers would open , the Governor said : " When they open . It is better to do a thing right than to do it in a hurry . " The Governor took the same tack when the commissioners were asked when they expected to name an administrator to head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best man there is , " the Governor declared . " It is better to do it right than to do it in a hurry . " Strike Question Raised A question about what the commission would do if it found itself faced with a general strike of dock workers Oct. 1 brought a variety of responses . General Rose said : " We will be very sorry , " General Hays said : " We will meet that when it arises . " The Governor said : " The commission 's functions do not involve labor relations . It is not a labor relations commission . " I General Hays , echoing the Gov , governor 's point , said the law creating the commission specifically inIstructed it not to meddle in " legitimate labor relations . " When a ' reporter suggested that a strike by the racket-ridden I. L. A. might not come under the head of legitimate labor relations , General Hays said the commission would look to the Governor 's labor advisers for guidance on whether it was legiti-nate or not . The commissioners said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They estimated that the total commission staff would come to 100 persons , none of whom has yet , been selected . No decision has ' been made on whether the centers will be operated directly by them commission or by the established State Employment Services , and ' no arrangement has been made for obtaining Federal funds under the Wagner-Peyser Act . The two generals are operating from temporary offices in the headquarters of the State Crime Commission at 270 Broadway . 1They are being assisted by a temporary staff " borrowed " from New York and New Jersey agencies . The likelihood of a dock strike ' here at the end of this month , caused the Association of British ) Chambers of Commerce in London ' to notify its members not to ship ' goods to New York later than , Sept. 26 . The association said it , had been informed that a strike , would " almost certainly " begin ) when present contracts expired at midnight Sept. 30 . Committees representing the longshore union and the New York Shipping Association will resume , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but litAle headway has been made in past discussions . The employers ) fear that the union is bent on , forcing a strike as part of its program of resistance to the new waterfront control laws . The last lingering possibility that the union might move to clean its own house before the American Federation of Labor acts next week to revoke its charter appeared to have vanished yesterday with word that the I. L. A. executive council had voted 12 to 8 ' against holding a special meeting this week . The meeting at which Mr. Sampson 's reinstatement was voted was held at Local 791 's headquarters , 164 Eleventh Avenue . Mr. Sampson 's ouster recently had been reversed by the New York District Council of the I. L. A. , but his backers , it was said , decided to seek a formal reinstatement by the local membership . After a two - and - a - half-hour ' meeting , Mr. Sampson told reporters : " No statements . " One source , however , said the vote was " unanimous . " Another said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that there was no ofEclat of the union authorized to ' speak publicly . The local has jurisdiction in the Chelsea area .
