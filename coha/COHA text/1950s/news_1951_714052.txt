txt Resentment against the army 's methods in dealing with honor code violations prevailed today among the 90 West Point cadets ordered dismissed from the United States military academy for cheating on examinations . ' Underlying the accused group 's bitterness was the generally expressed sentiment that many others have cheated in similar manner and none undisciplined . Some cadets , who said they were among the 90 ordered dismissed but who did not identify themselves , said that " at least 200 " cadets have violated the academy 's code of honor and that the violations have been taking place for as long as 12 years . One of these said that " more than 100 members " of last June 's graduating class were involved . Col. James B. Leer , West Point public information officer , denied this . " Insofar as I know , " Col. Leer said , " the evidence does not bear out the statement that any graduates have been involved . " Tells Pitfalls for Plebes Ronald L. Clough , 22 , a senior from Waukesha , Wis. , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of the men who come in as plebes freshmen learn about the honor code violations and think they have been going on for some time and just think it is natural and fall into it , " Clough told ' a reporter . " I have known men who were graduated who were involved . " Clough , as academic coach of the varsity , football team , helped tutor football players so they could maintain the required academic average for sperts eligibility . Cough indicated that he aided the football team at the request of academy officials , or at least with their knowledge . He did not make it clear whether he had cheated on- any classroom assignments , or whether he was discharged because hefailed to report cheating . The army did not comment on his statements . Father a Hotel Chef Clough whose name is pronounced " Cluff " is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Ermon Cough of Waukesha . The father , chef at the Avalon hotel there , said in Waukesha today that his son had not informed him he was among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of the inGestigation being made when he was at home for a visit two weeks ago . Young Cough attended St. Joseph 's Catholic grade school and Waukesha High school , making a four-year average of 98 out of a possible 100 in high school . He attended Carroll college , a Presbyterian college at Waukesha , for 2% yew 's before receiving his appointment to West Point . Clough 's cadet roommate , Harrison Travis ; 20 , of Atlantic Highlands , N. J. , said he , too , was among the expellees . Travis ' father , Harrison G. Travis , a retired lieutenant colonel and former Wes Point engineering instructor , said he thought the cadets got a " rough deal " and that he planned to provide legal aid for as many of the 90 as possible . " If they are guilty at all they are guilty of abiding by a system that started long before they were out of knee pants , " the elder Travis said . Clough and his roommate both were bitter over the army 's handling of the scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation and that the whole matter would be kept secret , " Clough said . Instead they received official notice from the academy 22 hours after the news was made public . Young Blaik Bitter Another cadet who expressed bitterness over the action was Bob Blaik , son of Coach Earl H. Red Blaik , whose 1951 football team reportedly was shattered by the ousters . Its exact status is not known to the public because the army has refused to give out the names of the 90 . Only a few , like Clough and Travis , have admitted their involvement to reporters . Two players on the football squad have thus far been disclosed as " in the clear . " One is John Eddie Weaver , a first string end . The other is Richard G. Inman , a guard . Their parents reported both had informed them they were not involved . In Washington , the Pentagon was still adamant against demands that the names of the Coach Blaik left and son , Bob cadets be released . The official view is that they are young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for the names said they should be published as a protection for other cadets who are compelled to leave the academy under honorable circumstances , such as medical disabilities and inability to maintain the scholastic standards . Blaik did not indicate whether he is one of the 90 expelled cadets , but used the pronoun " we " in referring to them . He was intercepted by reporters in front of the gymnasium , and approximately 30 cadets , most of them among the 90 , gathered around . " We were not allowed to notify our parents all over the country in advance , " Blaik complained . " First notice they got was front the newspapers and over the radio . " Tell 12 Year Violations Others in the group around Blaik told of as many as 200 cadets being involved , and of violations dating back 12 years . One cadet said those ousted admitted the cheating when questioned about it , but others equally guilty denied under oath that they had cheated and escaped punishment . Another member of the group said : " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me into battle than the others . " " We wart legal advice , " said another cadet . Another added , " We are going to demand honorable discharges . " Coach Blaik dodged reporters nearly 24 hours . When he was found finally and asked for comment he said , " No . " Col. Leer conferred with Maj. Gen. Frederick A. Irving , West Point superintendent , and then told reporters : " No one has been discharged or dismissed to this moment . Each individual case will be reviewed . There will be a decision in each individual case as to what final action will be . " The type of discharge is not known . Whether it will be a special discharge or some other of the five army discharges is still to be determined by the department of the army . " Officials said about 60 of the 90 cadets involved are at West Point at present . At first they were confined to their barracks or the immediate area .
