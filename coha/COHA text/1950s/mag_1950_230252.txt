With the insistent spiel of carnival barkers , Boston 's newspapers were dangling moneymaking lures to get circulation . In recent weeks , their readers could try for a $20,000 top prize in the morning Herald 's and afternoon Traveler 's " Know New England " contest , untangle " Tangled Towns " for $15,375 in the morning &; evening Globe , unscramble movie stars ' names for $20,000 in the morning Post . If they still kept a sense of direction , they could play " Where Am I ? " for $25,000 in prizes in Hearst 's morning Record and afternoon American . <P> By such timeworn stunts , Boston 's seven daily and four Sunday newspapers were desperately trying to win new readers ; they needed them . For some , circulation had already slumped badly : the Post , after raising its price from 3 to 5 , had lost 70,000 of its 400,000 readers in a year . Even the morning Herald and its afternoon sister , the Traveler , reputedly Boston 's biggest moneymakers , had lost 40,000 , and their profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a hard time just holding their own . <P> A big part of Boston 's newspaper trouble is an overcrowded market . With only one less newspaper than New York , Boston has a circulation area ( 3,000,000 ) only one-fourth as big . But some of the papers ' troubles also stem from a unique and weirdly wonderful kind of indigenous Boston journalism . <P> Kings &; Puppies . Although all other big city papers long ago dropped the practice , Boston papers still carry Page One display ads , charge three to six times as much for them as for inside ads . The result is that much valuable news space below the fold is filled with ads . What space is left is largely wasted by oversized headlines , and a make-up as haphazard as if the type had been fired from a blunderbuss . <P> The big play is usually given to such local news as murders , rapes and fires . One day last week , the Post carried no less than ten such Page One stories , ineluding : BEATINGS OF WAIFS CHARGED ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAB : MAN KILLED IN TRUCK CRASH ; AUTO DRAGS CHILD OF THREE 200 YARDS ; and EXPECT INN DEATH <P> CASE BREAK SOON . As if to balance this gruesome fare , the Post 's two Page One pictures that day were of a Catholic bishop and of Revivalist Billy Graham ( TIME , March 20 ) , now on a tour of New England . <P> In the drive for street sales , editors often reach preposterously for a local angle . Hearst 's American reached all the way to Siam and back again last week for the headline on its story about Cambridge-born King Phumiphon 's return to Siam : BOSTON KING IN ODD RITES . With equal zeal , Boston papers reach for any story labeled B.O. MUST ( e.g. , a story from the business office sent in by an advertiser ) . But when news breaks that might offend an advertiser , such as a fire or robbery at a department store or a suicide at a leading hotel , either the story is not covered or the location is thoughtfully omitted . <P> Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
