FOR the art neophyte in search of a style after World War II , the place to be was San Francisco . The California School of Fine Arts , which in the 1930s had brought Diego Rivera to San Francisco , had suddenly burst into life again , this time around two fiery abstract painters , Russian-born Mark Rothko , who was scrubbing canvases with shimmering bands of color , and North Dakota-born Clyfford Still , whose outsize paintings suggested both Western canyons and bark peeled from a tree . Talented younger men ( notably Sam Francis and Lawrence Calcagno ) spread the Rothko-Still gospel in staccato dab-and-dash across the U.S. and on to Paris and Rome . <P> Split Coming . Almost as suddenly as it arose , the San Francisco Renaissance split . Still and Rothko departed for the East Coast . Dean of those who remained was Boston-born David Park , and in 1951 he abruptly turned his back on abstract expressionism and won an award in the San Francisco Annual for a painting , Boys on Bicycles , in which the boys were boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow older , " Park said , " it dawns on you that you are yourself-that your job is not to force yourself into a style , but to do what you want . " The result was to sire a new and on the whole gentler generation of San Francisco figure painters , most conspicuous of whom is Richard Diebenkorn ( TIME color , March 17 , 1958 ) . Park , 48 , who sold 14 canvases at prices from $500 to $2,000 in a one-man show at Manhattan 's Staempfli Gallery last month , still keeps the thick colors , fat brush strokes and overall concern with surface that marks the abstract expressionists , but he frankly welcomes figures back into art . " Before , " he confesses , " I felt like a critic while I was painting , not a painter . Besides , I like bodies . " <P> Beware of Death . But Clyfford Still , 54 , pushed on into abstraction with never a backward look . He treats art as an apocalyptic vision , refuses to let visitors ( even buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a one-man show at Venice 's Biennale because of his professed fear that it would be misinterpreted as catering to " the praise of Vanity Fair . " " A painting in the wrong hands is a highly dangerous force , " Still hints darkly , " just like a mathematical equation . " <P> An unreconstructed individualist , Still pours odium and contempt on his contemporaries , scorns their " witless parodies " and " capering before an expanse of canvas . " <P> This week Still , who has not shown a single painting in seven years , is relenting in a big way , as Buffalo 's Albright Art Gallery opens its doors on a one-man show of 72 oils covering 21 years . Still set stiff terms : all pictures were to be hung by himself , all competing modern canvases were to be banished from sight .
