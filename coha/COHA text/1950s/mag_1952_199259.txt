Up on the bulletin boards in The New Yorker 's drab Manhattan office last week went a notice : " William Shawn has accepted the position of editor of The New Yorker , effective today . " The announcement , signed by Raoul Fleischmann , the publishing company 's president and largest stockholder , came as no surprise . As second in command under the late editor , Harold Ross , 44-year-old Shawn was his natural successor , although outwardly he is as different from Ross as The New Yorker is from the National Geographic . <P> A small ( 5 ft. 5 in. ) , pink-cheeked man who wears a button-front sweater with his Brooks Brothers suit , Shawn has a reputation for politeness and tact that is almost as legendary as Ross 's volcanic temper . " No one , " says a friend , " has yet gotten through a door behind him . " Editor Shawn never swears or raises his voice . He works up to 14 hours a day as quietly as a bank clerk , carries home a pile of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays hot jazz on the piano and reads four or five books a week . <P> Gentle Suasion . Where Ross peppered his writers with long or acid queries , Shawn gets what he wants by gentle suasion . When he likes an article he often calls the author-even late at night-to tell him so . But as editors , the only deep difference between Ross and Shawn , says one writer , " is that Shawn is about 100 decibels quieter . " Shawn has the same passion as Ross for facts and accuracy , and is so precise that even a craftsman like S. N. Behrman says : " I like to do a New Yorker piece once a year just to get the benefit of Shawn 's editing . " <P> No New Yorker himself , Shawn was born on Chicago 's South Side , the son of a cutlery dealer . After two years at the University of Michigan and three months as reporter on the Las Vegas ( N. Mex . ) Optic ( present circ. 4,613 ) , Shawn got-married , settled in Chicago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yorker and had become " infatuated with it . " He went to New York in 1932 , planning to write a book about the magazine . Instead , he landed a job as a reporter for " Talk of the Town . ' " <P> Fact &; Fantasy . In his first two years , he hardly laid eyes on Ross . But Ross had his eye on Shawn . He made him head of the " idea " department , which suggested many of the magazine 's articles and cartoons , four years later boosted him to " managing editor for fact , " i.e. , everything but fiction and cartoons . Only once , in 1936 , did Shawn write a piece for the magazine , a wry fantasy called " Catastrophe , " in which New York City was completely destroyed by a meteor and quickly forgotten by everyone . <P> Shawn plans no changes in The New Yorker formula . Circulation is at a peak 343,580 , and net profits , which were $630,000 in 1950 , are estimated to be down only slightly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
