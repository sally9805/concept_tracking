Head-hunting among the Marindese and Boetinese tribes of New Guinea is not mere wanton cruelty , but a " moral-religious necessity . " The natives have the highest motives : they love their children and yearn for immortality , and headhunting is their way of satisfying both urges . This theory is expounded by Anthropologist Justus M. Van der Kroef of Michigan State College , in the current American Anthropologist . <P> Chief problem among the people on the south coast of New Guinea is how to name their children . No ordinary name will serve . Each child must have a name that has been taken-along with a head-from a living person . If a child lacks this sort of name , he is a miserable creature , derided by his playmates and a reproach to his parents . <P> The Attack . When too many unnamed children accumulate in a village , the conscience-stricken grownups must do something about it , to wit , launch a headhunting raid . With solemn care and deliberation , the warriors and elders work out a plan of campaign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They explore its approaches , creep close to its huts , study the habits of its people . They try to eavesdrop on conversations to learn their victims ' names . <P> Back at home the excitement grows . Food is collected ; weapons are sharpened ; canoes are repaired and made ready . The great drums roll . <P> At last the big day comes . Most of the able-bodied men and some of the young women crowd into war canoes and paddle stealthily up the Digoel River . They land at a prearranged point and are guided by scouts to the doomed village . That night the elders whisper incantations to make the attackers invisible , and to make their victims sleep deeply . Then the hunters creep close to the huts and wait for dawn . <P> When the first light shows faintly , the leader gives a shout : " I have come to take your heads ! " and the attack begins . The hunters rush the village , shooting flaming arrows into the thatched roofs . If the maneuver is skillfully performed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men &; women , are rounded up and urged to tell their names . <P> Then comes the beheading , performed with ceremony . The implement used is a bamboo knife . Small children are spared and adopted , in the hope that they will tell the names of the unidentified dead . <P> The Homecoming . Laden with heads and new names , the canoes start down the river . Now there is singing and laughing , for this is a joyous occasion . But the warriors begin to weep when they first see their homes and think of the sad little children who have not yet got names . <P> After prolonged ceremonies , a lavish celebration is prepared . The people cut bamboo to fence a dancing area , and build covered seats and sleeping couches all around its margin . An elaborate feast is made ready . The warriors braid their hair , at a sign from the elders , the drums roll and the warriors parade around the dance area showing to their fellow citizens the heads that they have taken . <P> High point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They form in a line representing a snake , the symbol of immortality . One by one , the warriors join in . The heads that are carried aloft are symbols , not only of death , but of future life , for attached to them are precious names for the next generation : the ceremonial immortality of the tribe is assured .
