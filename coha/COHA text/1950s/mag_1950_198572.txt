( See Cover ) <P> As the world 's largest grocer , the Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. sells one out of every seven cups of coffee in the U.S. , one out of every 14 pounds of butter , and one out of every 28 eggs . Of every dollar the U.S. spends on food , about 10 is passed over A &; P counters-a massive yearly total of $2.9 billion . Next to General Motors , the A &; P sells more goods than any other company in the world . <P> In 3,100 U.S. cities , the familiar red-front A &; P store is the real melting pot of the community , patronized by the boss 's wife and the baker 's daughter , the priest and the policeman . To foreigners A &; P 's vast supermarkets are among the wonders of the age ; to the U.S. middle class , they are one of the direct roads to solvency . " Going to the A &; P " is almost an American tribal rite . <P> But despite this bigness and despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , very few Americans know the A &; P 's masters . They are shadowy figures , who have wrapped themselves over the years in such deliberate obscurity that even some of A &; P 's 120,000 employees are not sure who they are . Recently , at an A &; P supermarket one of the checkers whispered to a customer : " See that white-haired old gentleman over there ? That 's the owner of the company - John D. Rockefeller . " <P> It was n't John D. It was John A. ( for Augustine ) Hartford , 78 , who with his 86-year-old brother , George L. ( for Ludlum ) Hartford , forged the links in the A &; P 's nation-girdling chain . The A &; P is one of the great American family empires still bossed by the men who built it . The Hartfords and their kin still own 99.1% of the stock . <P> Mr. John &; Mr. George . The Hartfords are more than millionaires , expansionists , bosses and experts on longevity . They are perhaps the most unusual business team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I were asked to name the two men who seemed least likely to agree on anything , " said an A &; P associate , " I 'd pick John and George Hartford . " <P> Both brothers are widowers ; both live only for the A &; P. But there the similarity ends . John is thin , George is plump . John is bold and expansive , George cautious and conservative . John is gregarious and full of quips , George shy and sobersided . John stands and talks ; George sits and listens . Plain and unpretentious George , in his drab black suit , sedate tie and stiff collar , could easily be taken for a retired motorman dressed up for Sunday . <P> Nobody would make that mistake about John , who looks the merchant prince from the tip of his elegant shoes to the top of his wavy-maned , handsome head . He dresses as fastidiously as a latter-day Beau Nash . A symphony in greys , he orders as many as a dozen suits at a time from exclusive Manhattan Tailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman ) . He always sports a deep red carnation in his buttonhole , tucks an expensive handspun , monogrammed linen handkerchief in the pocket beneath it . His silk and poplin shirts are custom-made ( by Sulka ) with a special high , soft collar . His oversized , flowing bow ties , supposedly copied from those worn by Elbert ( Message to Garcia ) Hubbard , give him a faintly poetic air .
