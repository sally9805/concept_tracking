When Foreign Correspondent Ernie Hill of the Chicago Daily News first received his orders to London , he knew that life was going to be hard for his teen-age stepson Jonathan . After attending U.S. public schools in Oklahoma and New York , and the American School in Tokyo , Jonathan knew no Latin , was way behind in French and algebra . Besides , as his father said , he " declined all invitations to study , and expressed the belief that all teachers were jerks . " But by last week , after only two months in Castle Hill College , in a London suburb , Jonathan had changed-so much so , in fact , that Correspondent Hill felt compelled to make a report on the case to his paper . <P> " The change , " said he , " leaves me strictly speechless . In the eighth grade last year at the American School in Tokyo , he was tardy 37 times , and the year before in New York , 32 times . . . I once went to his school in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone fired a book at me . All the kids were standing up screaming . The teacher was shouting and banging the desk . <P> " ' They 're so spirited this morning , ' she told me outside . ' Their little personalities are expressing themselves . We do nothing to curb the ego . ' When she went back into the classroom , she was beaned by an orange . . . <P> " Then ... in Tokyo , six of them gave their egos a workout by pushing one boy through a window . . . <P> " British schools , " continued Reporter <P> Hill , " just do n't operate that way . Jonathan , 14 , has not yet been late . You have , to beg him to stop studying and go to bed . He even works out lessons ahead . He has started saying ' Yes , sir , ' ' Yes , thank you , ' and ' No , thank you ' just like a civilized human being . . . One night he did homework until midnight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made inquiry that evening : ' What if you did n't have your prep ( that 's English for homework ) ? . . . What if you went without it ? ' . . . ' Well , the Head . . . would send you down to his study . He would n't talk or beg you to do your work . He would just give you six of the best . . . That 's six wallops with his birch cane . And boy , do they hurt ! ' <P> " I inquired also what would happen if he was late . That would result in about two with the cane . And what would happen if he threw an orange at the teacher or hit him between the eyes with a paper clip , as in New York or Tokyo ? . . . ' That would be Monday night detention for three to five hours , plus six of the best , plus no more football or swimming for the rest of the term . . . ' <P> " At this point , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his ego is being damaged by discipline ... I am just basking in the warm glow of an unbelievable transformation that makes life so calm and peaceful where once it was so raucous . "
