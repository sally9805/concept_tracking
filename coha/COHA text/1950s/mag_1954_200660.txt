Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , riding so high as the year began , was now deep in trouble . Labor unrest was increasing ( see above ) . France was threatening to upset his cherished EDC and , worst of all , the strange case of Otto John was haunting and hurting the old Chancellor . <P> Last week , after 22 days under Communist wraps , Otto John faced a press conference in East Berlin that was open to Western correspondents . No more nervous than usual . Adenauer 's former security chief read a six-page statement into a battery of microphones , then freely answered questions from 300 correspondents for an hour . Gist of his statement : he had defected to the Communists because " the Nazis and the militarists in West Germany are again in power " and " the Bonn-Paris axis is only a tool of the Americans . " Americans , he said he had learned on his recent visit to Washington , are " downright hysterically mad in fear of Communism . " <P> Later , accompanied by four Communist officials but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked for 45 minutes with three old acquaintances : New York Herald Tribune Correspondent Gaston Coblentz and two British newspapermen . He was neither a Communist nor a traitor , he insisted , and he certainly had not been lured across the line . " My decision to stay in East Germany was only finally made after my talks with the Communist authorities , " he said . " I would have been free to return if I had wanted to . " <P> After this performance , the West German government did an about-face . Gerhard Schrder , Adenauer 's Minister of Interior , an ex-Nazi who is John 's old boss , had stoutly defended him and offered $119,000 reward for information about John 's " abduction . " Now he flatly called him a traitor . Schrder also did his best to free the Adenauer government of any blame : the British , he said , had forced John 's appointment as West Germany 's security chief after rejecting <P> Bonn 's own candidates , and the West German government had suspected him for a long time. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came demands for Schrder 's dismissal and a special session of Parliament to discuss the John case . At week 's end Chancellor Adenauer , facing what may be a fight for his political life , reluctantly agreed to Socialist demands and ordered Parliament to meet early in September . <P> <P> * Editorialized the normally Anglophile New York Times : " Dr. John , who served British intelligence during the war . . . thus takes his place at the side of Fuchs , May , Pontecorvo , MacLean , Burgess and other traitors who evaded the British security system . It is perhaps time to suggest a little more cooperation between the British and American intelligence services in matters that could mean life or death for all of us. "
