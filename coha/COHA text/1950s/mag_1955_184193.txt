Franklin D. Roosevelt , master politician , liked to meddle in party primaries , particularly to purge Democrats who obstructed the presidential will , and sometimes ( e.g. , 1938 ) he got his fingers burned . Dwight Eisenhower has gone to the opposite extreme , bringing to the presidency a conception of aloofness toward his role as party leader . If his program was good , he thought , people would vote for it , and his party would win . <P> Last fall the President learned that politics is not that simple . In the close congressional election , the President 's program was not repudiated , but his party lost control . Few strong Republicans lost , but many weak ones did . Ike saw more clearly that good government entails party responsibility , and that party leadership involves some influence on the choice of congressional nominees . <P> By the time most of the weak spots on Republican tickets came to Ike 's attention last year , it was too late to do anything about them . Last week from the White House came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party 's precampaign jockeying and is taking an early lead in molding the Republican line-up for 1956 . To a recent White House stag breakfast , Ike summoned Arthur B. Langlie , three-term governor of Washington . More than a year ago , 54-year-old Governor Langlie announced that he would not run for a fourth term . After some speculation ( e.g. , that he wanted to be Ambassador to Sweden , land of his forebears ) , Washingtonians began to take at face value his professed desire for political retirement . <P> Over the breakfast Ike asked Art Langlie to run for the Senate next year against Democratic incumbent Warren Magnuson . " Maggy , " who has been busy churning out favors for constituents , will be no pushover , especially for a Republican with little advance buildup . Ike , loath to lose able Ikeman Langlie from the political scene , promised that if Langlie takes on Magnuson : i ) the White House will chan nel federal patronage and aid programs through the governor , and 2 ) Dwight Eisenhower will campaign for him . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By week 's end he was saying : " I do n't rule out the possibility . "
