txt Passenger car'production in the U.S. in the second quarter this year is scheduled to decline below the curtailed output levels of the first quarter , and output for the-year is currently set for slightly under 4,800,000 autos , according to unofficial estimates . Production by the five U.S. auto makers in April , May and June is put at an average of about 87,000 cars weekly . This would compare with an average of 95,285 cars weekly in the first quarter this year and 121,637 in the second quarter of 1957 . Such levels of production projected for the second quarter are considered an indication the industry will order further closedowns and layoffs . It should be noted these second quarter and full year production projections are only tentative forecasts . They would be quickly revised if sales should spurt , but for the moment at least , they are the projections on which the auto companies are basing their planning . Production schedules follow pretty closely the rate of retail sales in the auto industry . Accordmeto one official of a Big Three auto producer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring sales yet . We just do n't see one in the cards . " Even if there is an upturn in sales , he added , the industry still is faced with stocks of about 865,000 new cars currently in dealers ' hands . Retail Sales Outlook Prospective new car buyers sitil are cautious about purchasing on credit , speculates another statistician in the industry . A pickup in retail sales in the last nine selling days of March was expected , he said , and at best can be attributed to a normal seasonal rise . Industry sources have reported dealer sales in the final third of March averaged 15,500 cars daily , up from 13,000 cars daily in the middle segment of the month . Only American Motors Corp . among the auto builders is understood to have scheduled an increase in production schedules for the second quarter this year over the second quarter of 1957 . The company reportedly has boosted production schedules for April anc May to 3,300 a week , about 10% over original production schedules for the quarter . Projected Output for Year Projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first quarter afid estimated output for the second quarter , currently is put unofficially below 4,800,000 . If a sales spurt fails to cause the auto industry statisticians to scrap their tentative forecast , this would be the lowest production since 1952 , when the industry turned out 4,337,443 cars . Last year . the industry built 6.115,467 autos . Because auto companies believe their production schedules would provide an advantage to competing makers , most of them refuse to release through official sources any such projectioni . Only Studebaker-Packard Corp . has released official estimates of production for April ( 4,620 cars ) and for the second quarter ( 13,000 ) . Unofficial sources , however , say industry output in June quarter this year in domestic plants is set around 1,131,000 . This would compare with 1,238,710 cars in the 1958 first quarter and with 1,581,287 in the second quarter last year . Based on those estimates , the industry at mid-year would have built a total of 2,369,710 , down from the 3,372,850 built in the first half oflast year . Divisions of General Motors Corp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to be produced in the second quarter this year . In the second quarter of 1957 , the company turned out a total of 711,512 cars , or 44.99% of the 1,581,287 cars built . American Motors and Studebaker-Packard also are slated to increase their percentage of production over the year-ago quarter . American Motors is scheduled to make 2.9% of the cars built this quarter , against 1.97% in the second quarter last year . Studebaker-Packard aims at about 1.15% of industry production in the period , compared with 1.07% the corresponding period last year . Chrysler Corp . ' s share of the output in the June quarter , however , is expected to decline to 15.48% from 2249% in the like quaiter last year , if present projections prove accurate . Ford Motor Co. ' a share is reportedly dtie to slip to 27.43% from the 29.75% in 1957 . Estimated production for April adds up to 364,600 cars . Such output would be slightly above last month 's production of 357,049 , but substantially below the 549,239 autos rolled off assembly lines in April , 1957 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 10 years . Dealer inventories are currently estimated at 865,000 cars , almost equal to the 886,000 cars held by dealers at this time in 1956 . , It was . in May of that year that dealers ' stocks hit a record high of over 580,000 . A year ago , inventories totaled 756,000 . Effect of " Auto Buy " Weeks Any revision in production scheduled for the second quarter depends on retail sales . " A continuance in April of the sales spurt during the last 10 days of March might do some good , " said one official in the industry . He attributed some of the increase in sales in late March mainly to " auto buy " weeks , being promoted in many cities . It is doubtful if talk of a cut in the 10% Federal excise tax on autos is hurting new car sales , he added . " Buyers in the mass market probably do n't snow anything about excise taxes and how they are likely to be affected by a cut , " he said . He added , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't hurt us much , it wo n't help us , either . "
