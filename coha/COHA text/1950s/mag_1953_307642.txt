Back from the globe 's Middle East crossroads , John Foster Dulles got down from an Air Force Constellation at Washington airport one evening last week , the first U.S. Secretary of State ever to have visited the vast , strategic region between the Aegean and the Ganges . Dulles and his party , including Mutual Security Director Harold E. Stassen , had bridged an arduous 20,000 miles in 20 days , listened and talked to the rulers of twelve countries inhabited by nearly half the people of the non-Communist world . <P> The Secretary 's grey suit showed the wear &; tear of travel , his blown grey hair needed a trim , his eyes behind the spectacles were bloodshot . But his energy seemed undiminished . Briskly he greeted a small group of friends and-dignitaries , then hurried to a waiting limousine , bound for an immediate report to the White House . Long after his departure , the plane was still unloading exotic items of luggage : rugs , tapestries , brass coffee tables and other gifts from newfound Middle Eastern friends . <P> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , Dulles outlined the background for a more sharply defined U.S. policy in the Middle East . Highlights : <P> The U.S. supports legitimate Middle East nationalism , but not at the price of disrupting Western unity . " The Western powers can gain , rather than lose , from an orderly development of self-government , " said the Secretary . He thought the U.S. could act the role of honest broker in the Middle East , e.g. , help find a solution that will reconcile " Egyptian sovereignty and international concern " in the Anglo-Egyptian Suez base dispute . <P> The U.S. believes that " the day is past " when aspirations of " the peoples of the Near East and Asia can be ignored " ; that the U.S. can " usefully help " progress by providing technical assistance under MSA ( but " in some cases " Middle East governments should use their own oil royalties to better advantage ) . <P> The U.S. " stands fully " behind the U.S.-British-French declaration of 1950 , guaranteeing the Arab-Israeli frontiers . <P> The U.S. wants both Israel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes for internationalization of Jerusalem 's holy places . Dulles found the Arabs " more fearful of Zionism than of Communism . " <P> The Truman Administration 's plan for a Middle East Defense Organization " is a future rather than immediate possibility . " Meanwhile the U.S. " can usefully help strengthen the interrelated defenses of those countries which want strength . "
