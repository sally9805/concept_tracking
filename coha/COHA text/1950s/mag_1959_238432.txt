For the fifth time since Dwight Eisenhower took office in 1953 , the U.S. Congress last week tried to override a presidential veto-and for the fifth time it failed . Last week 's Senate vote of 55-40 , nine short of the two-thirds majority needed to override , came on the $1,375,000,000 housing bill , which Ike had vetoed in his battle to keep the nation 's budget in balance . The issue was forced by the Senate 's Democratic liberals , desperately anxious to get out from under the President 's firm fiscal thumb . In insisting on an attempt to override , they exposed themselves and their party to a needless and humiliating defeat . <P> Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson , a master at the art of the possible , had argued against the attempt . " We told them there was n't a chance of overriding that veto , " says a Johnson aide . " They would n't listen . They wanted to butt their heads against a wall . " Said Johnson after the vote , in pointed reference to his liberal colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Next day the Senate Banking and Currency Committee approved a substitute , trimmed-down housing bill of $1,050,000,000-$240 million above the amount recommended by President Eisenhower , but perhaps low enough to avoid another veto . <P> In other action last week : <P> The House Ways &; Means Committee , after weeks of indecision , approved by 16 to 9 a 1-per-gallon increase in the 3 federal gasoline tax , effective Sept. 1 , to keep the 41,000-mile interstate-highway program rolling ( see BUSINESS ) . <P> The Senate reversed its Finance Committee , voted 75-20 to increase the non-service-connected disability pensions of more than 1,100,000 veterans and their widows and orphans . The payoff , long advocated by the American Legion , would amount to $10 billion , spread over 40 years . The House , by voice vote , went along with the Senate , but the chances of the bill escaping a veto were slight . <P> The Senate , by a 47-45 vote , passed and sent to the House the year 's weirdest bill : a Democratic-sponsored measure to establish , in prosperous 1959 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps . Under its terms , some 150,000 males , aged 16 to 21 , would eventually serve for terms ranging from six months to two years , receive $60 a month , plus room , board and transportation . The bill had about as much chance of beating a veto as the Washington Senators have of winning the World Series .
