West Germany has successfully cleared its rubble , and achieved a hard-won economic recovery . But how successfully has it cleared its old habits of thought ? Opportunities to test such changes of mind are hard to come by . Last week a cabinet crisis in Lower Saxony provided a dramatic test case . <P> When a new state government took office last month , the job of Minister of Culture went to aggressive , 34-year-old Leonhard Schlter . He had been a hard , bright , ambitious youngster in Hitler 's Germany . His mother was half-Jewish , but somehow even this did not handicap him too much . While some of his relatives were killed in concentration camps , young Schlter went into Hitler 's Wehrmacht , won a decoration in France , was wounded and discharged , then entered the University of Gttingen as a law student . <P> When to Shift . When the British occupied Lower Saxony , Schlter presented himself as a victim who had suffered for his trace of Jewish blood , got a job as a high-ranking police officer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop , efficient at rounding up local Nazis , but just as rough on others , too . But when his administration was involved in accusations of bribery , embezzlement and maltreatment , the British fired him . <P> Schlter turned to politics , and displayed a blatant affinity for Naziism . " National Socialism is the most healthy movement in Germany since the turn of the century . " he is reported to have shouted from a political platform . In the ultranationalist region of Lower Saxony and in the disorder of early postwar politics , such demagoguery served him well . But he always knew when to shift his line , when to recall his Jewish blood and pose as a victim of the Nazis . <P> He became an organizer of extreme right political parties in the British zone , won a seat in the Gttingen town council , and headed a publishing house whose favorite authors were old Nazis justifying their pasts . In 1949 the British banned him from politics . But with the end of military government , he was back with a new party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Lower Saxony parliament . Two weeks later he abandoned his own party , jumped over to the more respected Free Democrats , the right wing of Chancellor Adenauer 's four-party federal coalition . Despite his past , he rose fast in the FDP , was a party leader in Lower Saxony when he became Minister of Culture . <P> War of Protest . When his appointment was announced , the rector and his entire senate ( some 20 professors ) at the University of Gttingen resigned in shocked protest . Then followed one of the most heartfelt outbursts of democratic feeling in West Germany 's brief history . Students all over Germany protested ; Gttingen 's 5,000 students remained off campus , educators and scientists flooded the state government with protests . The West German press blasted him with editorials , devoting more space to his case than to Khrushchev 's visit to Belgrade . Said the respected Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung : " Schlter is not accused of a false belief of yesterday but of wrong actions today . These actions are opposed to the idea of freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Schlter resigned as Minister of Culture .
