The big race was scheduled to start at 10 a.m. , but as usual supercharged crowds , festive and hungry for thrills , began gathering outside Indianapolis Speedway at dawn . By race time , some 150,000 had crammed their way into the stands and infield to watch 33 underslung , overpowered little cars roar around the 2-mile brick and asphalt track in the annual 500-mile grind . <P> Mechanics and drivers were up early too , fussing and tuning up the streamlined little racers , looking for flaws , profanely praying that hidden parts would function smoothly . At Driver Johnnie Parsons ' station in the pits the mechanic could hardly believe his eyes . Parsons ' bright yellow Wynn 's Special ( representing an investment of $35,000 ) looked sleek and fit , but under the unstrapped hood the mechanic had found a telltale trickle of water seeping out of a crack in a spanking-new cylinder block . There was no time to change engines , so the mechanic did the next best thing : he filled the crack with metal sealer , slapped a coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad news . <P> Benzol &; Alcohol . It was about the worst news an Indianapolis driver could hear . Handsome , 31-year-old Driver Parsons had placed second in the big race last year , and his Wynn 's Special , with its new high-compression ( 13 to 1 ) Meyer-Drake Offenhauser engine , had performed beautifully during the tryouts . Now the threadlike slit in the engine block threatened to crack his hopes wide-open . But heavy-footed Johnnie Parsons had no thought of withdrawing on that account . <P> Johnnie 's mechanic assured him that if his engine could hold up for the first 50 miles everything would probably be all right ; the heat should seal it tight for the rest of the race . Johnnie Parsons felt that he could not afford to nurse his car along for all of those 50 miles . On the ninth lap , he rammed the foot throttle down and skittered into the lead , past Veteran Mauri Rose , three-time winner of the race , who pounded along doggedly in Johnnie 's exhaust trail-a nauseous compound of burned benzol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I saw my chance and I wanted some of that lap money " - $100 for the leader of each 2-mile circuit . <P> Rose took the lead back at the 33rd lap , but Johnnie Parsons figured that his little four-cylinder engine was hot and solid enough now to take all he could give it . Two laps later he had the lead again . By this time , hitting a roaring 165 m.p.h. in the straightaways , skidding and spinning into the turns , the 33-car field was thoroughly scrambled . <P> Parsons ' pace was shattering records at every 25-mile mark ; it was also taking its toll of cars and drivers . Physical and mechanical fatigue , burned-out bearings , fouled-up fuel lines and twisted supercharger shafts were bringing an end to expensive dreams .
