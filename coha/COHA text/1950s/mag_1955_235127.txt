THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS ( 260 pp. ) - Louis Kronenberger-Knopf ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> The U.S. has never had so many working literary critics as now , never so few who seem to enjoy what they read . One result is that they are themselves seldom read except by colleagues and students . Most readers are apt to conclude that the highbrow critics dig too much and dig up too little . At worst , they suggest that literature is so serious a business that it is a mistake to look to it for pleasure . <P> But pleasure is precisely what Man of Letters Louis Kronenberger ( The Thread of Laughter , The Pleasure of Their Company ) can find in books , along with enlightenment and instruction . The Republic of Letters is a collection of literary essays that presents writers as exciting companions rather than as cadavers for hypercritical dissections . A drama critic ( for TIME ) , playwright and novelist himself , Author Kronenberger is not easily pleased , but he refuses to approach books as if the chore were unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he speaks sharply of his colleagues : " More and more of our serious critics are moving into the tight , gnomelike little world of the pedagogues , carrying on endless ill-natured controversies in print , confusing purism with integrity , using every critical article as the basis for another . As a result , criticism very misguidedly denies literature any sense of allure . . . " <P> In The Republic of Letters such literary greats as Henry Fielding , Johnson , Boswell , Gibbon and Byron appear freshly alluring . Author Kronenberger can take the measure of bent , spiteful Alexander Pope and awaken fresh interest in " the master of the scalpel and the poisoned dart who reclothed clichs of thought so vividly that they long ago became cliches of language . " He can persuade the reader that gabby Letter Writer Lady Mary Wortley Montagu is worth another whirl : " She had very few friends , but time was one of them . " And he can be shrewd about such old critically-untouchables as Robinson Crusoe : " Having contrived all by himself a Little England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . " <P> Author Kronenberger has a nice way of seeing his subjects both as men and as writers , and , when the shoe fits ( as in the case of Gibbon ) , as dullish people redeemed by works of genius . Quite clearly , Kronenberger 's ideal is 18th century England , where style " was not just a matter of stance and stride , of paying a compliment or wearing a coat . It was something men commanded in the stress of business . . . " And in the stress of the business of criticism , Kronenberger commands an unmatched style . For he can balance a sentence as if it were a crown jewel on a velvet pillow ; and he can also , occasionally , throw the pillow across the hall at a particularly dull archdeacon . The chief merit of The Republic of Letters ( besides establishing the author as one of that republic 's leading citizens ) is a feeling it generates in the reader-the feeling that the books under discussion must be read at the first opportunity , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay .
