M. , nearly two hours after a squall swept the Chicago area from the northwest with winds up to thirty-file miles an hour . The seiche was believed to have // developed as a result of the squall , and the sudden rise in atmospheric pressure that occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coast Guard and other sources said the squall , blowing across Lake Michigan , at 8 ; 30 A. M. , apparently had piled up water near Michigan City , Lid. , when a swell six to eight feet high was observed . This evidently was the origin of the phenomenon . A drop in the wind allowed the wave to roll back across the lake , reversing the path of the squall . And the effects were felt from Whiting , Ind. , to Waukegan , Ill .

" I threw myself down flat and held on to something . When the water went down , Castronovo still was beside me . We saw a middle-aged man floundering in the water about fifty feet from the pier . Castronovo wanted to go after him , but I held him back . " I saw others on the , pier who had managed to keep from being swept away . Some of them were extending fishing poles to help persons who were in the water . Out in the harbor , a man was trying frantically to row to shore , but the current was too strong . A pleasure boat went over and picked him up . " A water swell six to seven feet high rolled into Wilmette Harbor , in the northern suburb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only damage was an overturned empty sailboat .
