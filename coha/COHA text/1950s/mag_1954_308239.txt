Last week Michigan buzzed with candidates for public office . Republican Senator Homer Ferguson graced a Bay City fish fry . His Democratic opponent , Patrick McNamara , until recently a local leader of the pipe fitters ' union , gazed with admiring eye on a St. Clair County plowing contest . Democratic Governor G. Mennen Williams was out exercising the charm that had won him the title ( bestowed by a Republican ) of " the Liberace of Michigan politics . " His Republican rival , Lawyer Donald Leonard , politicked from Owosso to Kalamazoo . <P> Republicans in Michigan , as elsewhere , are banking heavily on President Eisenhower 's personal popularity . They must fight off criticism of G.O.P. farm policy , and to do so , Homer Ferguson has taken a straight , shrewd Michigan line . Says he : " The rigid price-support program placed most of its emphasis on farm crops which account for less than 10% of the farm income for Michigan farmers . " <P> Democrats are depending on unrest caused by layoffs in the Michigan auto industry . Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race is the upset of our economy under the Republicans . . . The simple truth is the Republicans promised the voters too much and a reaction has set in . It 's a case of broken promises . " And what does Candidate McNamara promise ? Merely to work for 100% of parity and a federal minimum-wage law requiring $1.25 an hour . <P> There was some doubt about how much all the fuss was worth in terms of political value . A recent survey , conducted under Republican auspices , showed Homer Ferguson ahead of McNamara by 65% to 35% , with Governor Williams leading Republican Leonard by 60% to 40% . If the poll was close to accurate-and many observers thought it was-no amount of campaigning could make up the difference .
