Cruel Sea " Are all hands on board ? " " Er  --  I reckon so , sir . " A singularly cold blue eye regarded him . " Well , are they or are n't they ? Did n't you have it reported to you ? " " There was only the postman , sir . I know he 's aboard . " " What about the mess-caterers ? What about the leading steward ?  --  he went shopping for me . What about the berthingparty ?

" Find out , and come and tell me on the bridge . And next time , remember that you report to me that the ship 's ready to sail , with all the crew on board , at the proper time .

It might be what was needed to pull him up short ; in any case , it was a move in the right direction . Then , as Ericson mounted the ladder towards the bridge , the small annoying scene faded from his mind and was swiftly replaced : he was aware only of an intense personal satisfaction that all the months of waiting , all the worry of fitting-out and commissioning , and all the loose ends of departure , had now been disposed of , and that Compass Rose  --  his own responsibility , almost his own invention  --  was ready at last for her maiden trip . It was not particularly impressive , that first tow down river to the oiler , save for one odd accompaniment to it that Ericson , like many other people on board , found moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered way , with a tug at either end , Petty Officer Tallow at the wheel , and Lockhart with his fo'c's'le party neatly fallen in by the windlass , a small cheer broke out from the knot of dockyard workers lining the quayside . It was ragged , it was unco-ordinated and unrehearsed : it was all the more impressivefor this rough spontaneity . Other men from other yards left their work to wave to Compass Rose as she passed down river  --  men who had built ships , were building them now , and would build countless others , pausing in their jobs to speed on her way the latest product of the Clyde . The moment of farewell was not prolonged : it was too cold to stand about , and the dusting of snow that overlay the quays and docks and berthing slips lining the river was a sharp reminder of the wintry day . But the gesture , repeated many times on their way toward the open sea , remained in the memory : the last message from the fraternity of men who built the ship , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Five hours later Compass Rose , under her own power , left the last narrow section of the river and nosed her way down stream towards the Tail-of-the-Bank , the naval anchorage off Greenock . The early winter dusk was beginning to close in , hiding the far reaches of one of the loveliest harbours in Britain : the line of hills surrounding it turned from purple to black shadow , the lit buoys and the shore lights came up blinking to challenge the twilight . It was now very cold , though the wind had died earlier that afternoon . Their berth had been signalled to them , and identified on the chart ; they still had a few hundred yards to go before they dropped anchor , and the Captain , with leisure to look about him , was studying the other ships that crowded the broad sweep of the Clyde estuary . There were many of them  --  a battleship , a smart new cruiser , half a dozen destroyers , an aircraft carrier , scores of minesweepers ; beyond them , in the merchant-ship anchorage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoy , dominated by two huge liners in the grey wartime dress of troopships . At the back of the bridge , Ericson could hear Leading SignalmanWells giving a running commentary on the ships in company  --  a commentary that revealed , as could nothing40 41The Cruel Seaelse , the sense of family that informs the Royal Navy . ( " The battleship 's the Royal Sovereign  --  we were at Gib with her , last spring cruise  --  there 's the old Argus , one of the first carriers ever built  --  that must be the Sixth Destroyer Flotilla  --  wonder what they 're doing here  --  that 's one of the new Town Class cruisers  --  did n't know they were in commissionyet . . . . " ) The pilot , a bluff Clydesider in a bowler hat , said suddenly : " Just coming on the bearing now , Captain ! " and Ericson returned to the business of anchoring . The telegraph clanged for Stop Engines , and then for Slow Astern : he called out : " Stand by ! " to Lockhart on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered gentle sternway , his shout of " Let go ! " was answered by the thunderous roar of the cable running out . Compass Rose lay at anchor , her first journey accomplished . The time , he was pleased to note , was three minutes past four : the dividing dusk was now upon them , and the air had a bitter edge to it , but the ring of shore lights and the scores of craft in company seemed to be bidding him and his ship welcome. 8Now came a further pause in their progress , easier to endurewith patience because it was more directly geared to their sea-going preparation . They were fourteen days at Greenock , some of them spent at anchor , ammunitioning and storing and doing harbour exercises , others devoted to their sea trials and the preliminary gunnery and depth-charge tests designed to prove their weapons . They could hardly have had lovelier surroundings in which to try out their ship : in the grip of a hard winter that whitened even the foot-hills with snow and gave to the higher peaks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when approached from seaward , had a breathtaking beauty . But they had not a great deal of leisure for looking about421939 : Learningthem , nor inclination either , however attractive were their surroundings : their eyes were now turning inward , toward the ship and their task in her . It was astonishing how , iso- lated at her anchorage or slipping in and out on her various trials , Compass Rose was already coming alive as a ship , a separate unit with a developing personality . The process of eighty-odd men shaking down together was well advanced , and now it was moving toward the next stage  --  the welding together of these men into a working crew , the tuning up for action . This was not true only of the wardroom , though here it was strongest since the wardroom supplied the directive influence : it was true of all of them  --  they were beginning to concentrate , beginning to feel that they and the ship had work to do , and that it was worth doing . Wishful thinking might exaggerate this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose was the worst abortion of a ship that ever put to sea , might seem to deny it ; but it was there all the same  --  a strong and subtle feeling of dedication . It was being helped , from outside , by the first convoy reports and rumours  --  some true , some exaggerated  --  and by the landing of Merchant Navy sur- vivors at near-by Gourock , from which it was clear that there must have been a number of U-boats already at sea , in full operational trim , on the day that war was declared . This , then , was going to be Compass Rose 's battle : it really existed , it was worth taking on , it had to be won , and the sooner they were ready for it the better . Lockhart was specially conscious of the beginning of this feeling when they went out on their gun trials , at the end of their first week at Greenock . The trials were simple enough : they fired a few rounds from the four-inch gun on the fo'c's'le , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns on the bridge , which completed an armament modest enough by any standard . ( " God help us if we run into the Scharnhorst , " said an imaginative seaman . " We 'll just have to creep up behind and her . . . . " ) But among the guns ' crews he had been working up in harbour , and espe- cially in a leading seaman called Phillips who was the gun-43The Cruel Seaner 's mate  --  the rating responsible for the cleanliness of the guns and the storage of ammunition  --  Lockhart was aware of an encouraging interest . Most of these guns ' crews were amateurs , of course  --  the " hostilities only " ratings who survivedthe derision of the regulars to become a huge majority in the Navy  --  but they learnt fast , and here and there an obvious instance of intelligence and enthusiasm marked one of them down for a higher rating , as soon as the necessary training had been completed . Phillips , who was also in charge of the fo'c's'le party , was big and slow-moving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it was clear that he would be , for Lockhart , an ally worth close cultivation . Ferraby , isolated aft among his depth charges , was having less success in working up to the necessary standard of competence . His key ratings were all right  --  Wainwright , the . torpedoman , who saw to the settings and actually dropped the charges , and Leading Seaman Tonbridge , who was in general charge of the depth-charge crews , were both energeticand dependable ; but most of the rest of his men fell far below this standard . Much of the work aft consisted of reloadingthe depth-charge throwers at high speed  --  a heavy job involving skillful teamwork ; and for it he had a motley collection of off-watch stokers and telegraphists , who did not take kindly to working on a windswept upper deck , like any common seaman , when their natural lair was a warm boiler-room or a cosy W/T office . . . . Many of them , too , were undeniably stupid , of the calibre of that Stoker Grey who had been the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ferraby , none too sure of himselfat the best of times , was hardly the person either to drill them into efficiency or to take a tough line when they were wilfully slack . The result was what might have been expected . There were mistakes , delays , failures : there was surprise when things went right , and a disgruntled indifference when they went wrong . Left to himself , Ferraby might have gained confidence and gradually worked his department into a going44I q 3 q : Learningconcern ; but Bennett , sensing the weak point and welcoming an easier target than Lockhart , was continually wandering aft and , leaning over the rail above the quarterdeck , destroyingby a stream of comment and counter-orders whatever self-sufficiency Ferraby might have built up . Ferraby grew to dread the daily depth-charge practices that were the rule when they were in harbour : it seemed hardly worth while giving preliminary instruction , and then setting the drill in motion , when at any moment the hated red face would top the rail above him and the raucous voice call out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the lashings are taken off ! " or , more simply : " Ferrabee ! That 's no bloody good at all  --  start it again ! " He had no one to complain to , nor , in the last analysis , any solid ground for complaint : he did make mistakes , and the depth-charge crews were slack and inefficient , and so , it seemed , it was going to continue , until he himself was superseded or Compass Rose was sunk . For all this zest for supervision , Bennett was not enjoying himself nearly as much as he had expected . Riding a dumb kid like Ferraby was all very fine , he found , but it was about the only compensation in a job that was steadily proving a bit too serious altogether . . . . He had managed to farm out nearly every piece of work that should normally fall to the First Lieutenant , but still the inescapable oddments remained , and he found them irksome  --  particularly things like keeping up-to-date the watch bill , as various ratings changed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make any sort of impression on Lockhart ( though he had n't finished there yet , by a long way ) , and a suspicion that the Captain was a good deal less impressionable than he had seemed at the beginning , these awkward factors were in process of spoiling what had looked like an agreeable billet . Bennett could n't make up his mind whether to chuck it now , and get something better  --  there were scores of soft jobs going begging , and snug niches to be filled , at this formative stage of the war  --  or to hang on a little longer and see if things improved . That would be one way of qualifying for a command , and a command was clearly the only thing to have , 45The Cruel Seaif you wanted to enjoy yourself at sea ; but sweating out a year or so as First Lieutenant might be too high a price to pay for it . Soon he would have to make his choice : in the meantime , there was Lockhart to be kept in view as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . Of them all , the Captain , with most to worry or distract him , was the least unsure of himself and of the future . He was beginning to like the ship , simply for her " feel " and her performance , quite apart from the proprietary pride that was always in the background : she had shown herself easy to handle , and though she was ludicrously slow in comparison with a destroyer  --  or indeed with any other warship he had ever heard of  --  she was highly manoeuvrable and could turn the corners adroitly . That speed of hers , of course , might rank as much more of a handicap in the future : the bare fifteen knots that was the most the Chief E.R.A. could coax out of her was slower than a good many merchant ships , and only a knot or so above the general speed in convoy  --  when , supposedly , she ought to be whistling round performing the prodigies of valour and skill set out in the Fleet Signal Book . At fifteen knots , she was liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a greyhound . The other major snag , from his own point of view , had alreadyshown itself : that was , her behaviour at sea . In any kind of seaway at all , Compass Rose rolled abominably : she had given an appalling demonstration of it on one of their first trips outside harbour , when , running down to the Isle of Arran in a very moderate sea that should not have bothered her at all , she had achieved a forty-degree roll and , apart from other damage sustained to movable gear below decks , had put one of her boats under water and nearly lost it altogether . High up on the bridge , hanging on grimly while Compass Rose swung through a drunken eighty-degree arc , Ericson had found himself wondering what it was going to be like when they met real Atlantic weather and had , perhaps , to hold their course and speed through it . . . . This light-hearted frolic was not the best augury for that future . But that was a test which need not yet be met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose turned homeward after her final trials and began the smooth run up the sheltered Firth of Clyde , Ericson was conscious only of an exhilarating satisfaction . The ship went forward at an easy ten knots , with the flood tide adding a couple more : the winter sunset , a lovely red and orange , made the bracken on the surrounding hillsides glow like fire . Moving through the still evening , parting the cold keen air with a steady thrust , the ship seemed to have a living purpose of her own , a quality of strength and competence , and Ericson found it hard to excludefrom his voice , as he gave the helm-orders that would lay a course through the defence boom , the eagerness that possessed him . For Compass Rose was clear : her engines and her armament were all in order : in a few days they would go north for their final working-up , and then she would be ready . That evening , in his cabin , Ericson signed for the ship and formally took her over from the builders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many flaws to start with , as was natural with a new ship of a new design , ranging from navigationlights that could not be seen , to the usual crop of weepingrivets ; but one by one they had all been set right , and he could find no more to complain of . Now it was his responsibility to say so , in unmistakable terms . The shipyard representative , a small brisk man whose badge of office  --  a bowler hat  --  he was reluctant to part with for more than a few seconds at a time , laid the printed form of release in front of him , and after reading it through Ericson put his signature at the bottom . Then he sat back . " That 's that , " he said . " And I 'd like to thank you for all you 've done for us . It 's been a great help . " " Glad to hear it , Captain . " The small man snatched up the paper , folded it , and thrust it in an inner pocket , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would change his mind . " I hope she 'll no ' disappoint you , and you 'll have good luck in her . " Ericson nodded . " Thanks . . . . How about a drink ? " 47The Cruel SeaThe small man shook his head and then , rather surprisingly , said : " Aye . " When the drinks had been poured he raised his glass formally and said : " Not too late to wish you a Happy New Year , Captain . " Ericson drank to it in silence . So much depended on Compass Rose : in fact everything depended on her  --  perhaps even the bare fact of their survival through 1940 . But that evening , when the ship at last was his , he did not want to share this thought with anyone. 9iOn her way north to Ardnacraish , Compass Rose spent her first night at sea . She was lucky in her weather : when she slipped through the boom ( luring the late afternoon it was raining heavily , with the promise of a hard blow as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conical mass of Ailsa Craig , and turned northward again , the sky had cleared and the wind gradually dropped to nothing . Later still , the bright moonlight gave them a visibility of several miles , and by midnight they were ploughing along at a steady twelve knots , with the mass of land to starboard as clearly discernible as if it had been full daylight . Compass Rose , with no sea to bother her and only a long gentle swell to surmount , had an easy motion : the pulse of the engine , and an occasional vibration from forward , served as reminders that she was now on passage instead of swinging round her anchor in harbour , but apart from that the night was as peaceful and as free from stress as any they had yet spent . Lockhart , muffled against the keen air in a kapok suit and sea boots , shared the middle watch  --  from midnight to four a.m.  --  with Bennett : it passed without incident or interest save that at two o'clock they met a southbound convoy and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bennett spent most of the watch dozing inside the asdicI 9 3 9 : Learninghut , leaving Lockhart to keep the look-out and write up the deck-log every hour . He did not mind : indeed , he would have taken it as a compliment if he had not known that it sprang from pure laziness and not from any particular confidence in his ability . But the brief period of authority , when the ship was handed over to him as his personal charge , was helpful to his self-confidence , apart from its value as a first experience of watchkeeping . He had been wondering just how sure of himself he would be , when the moment came for him to handle Compass Rose : now he knew , and the answer was reassuring . Ferraby and the Captain came up together at four o'clock , to take over the morning watch : Lockhart was amused to note that Bennett handed things over with an air of weighty responsibility , as if he had been on tiptoe throughout the entire four hours and would , even now , hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first couple of hours Ericson dealt with everything there was to be done , leaving Ferraby to watch him , or stare at the horizon , and occasionally to check a buoy or a lighthouse on the chart inside the asdic compartment : but towards six o'clock , when they were set on a straight , trouble-free course that would need no alteration for thirty miles or so , he decided that he 'd had enough of it . He had been on the bridge from dusk until midnight  --  about eight hours altogether  --  the pre ' , ious evening , and he needed sleep badly . He yawned , and stretched , and called Ferraby , who had wandered to the wing of the bridge . " Think you can take her now , sub ? " he asked . " This is our course for the rest of the watch , and there 's nothing in the way . How about it ? " " All right , sir . I  --  I 'd like to . " " You can get me on the voice-pipe if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats , and if you have to alter course , go to seaward of them rather than inshore . But you 'd better call me if there are a lot of them about . " " Aye , aye , sir . " " All right , then . . . . " He stayed for a few moments , 48 49The Cruel Seawatching the hills still looming clear to starboard , and the flashing light , which had been their mark for changing onto a new course , now just past the beam , and then he said : " She 's yours , sub , " and turned to go . His sea boots rang on the bridge ladder , and died away , and Ferraby was left to himself . He had never known such a moment in his life , and he found it difficult to accept without a twinge of near-panic . The whole ship , with her weapons and her watchful lookoutsand her sixty-odd men sleeping below , was now his : he could use her intricate machinery , alter her course and speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks . . . . He felt small and alone , in spite of the bridge look-outs and the signalman and the asdic rating who shared the watch with him : he was shivering , and he heard his heart thumping , and he wondered if he could bear it if they met a convoy , or if some accident  --  like the steering-gear breaking down  --  brought on a sudden crisis . He was n't really fitted for this : he was a bank clerk , he was only twenty , he 'd been commissionedfor exactly eight weeks . . . . But the minutes of uncertainty passed , as Compass Rose held her steady course and nothing happened to disturb it : she was , it seemed , a going concern , and possibly he knew just enough to supervise her without some catastrophic blunder which nothing could retrieve . Presently he began to enjoy himself . Leaning over the bridge rail , he could see the whole forepartof the ship clear in the moonlight : above him , the mast rolled through a slow , gentle arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretching out behind them was bounded by a thin line of phosphorescence that gave it a concise , formal beauty . He felt himself to be in the middle of a pattern , the focal point of their forceful advance : here was the bridge , the nerve-centre , with its faint glow from the binnacle and the dark motionless bulk of the two look-outs marking each wing , and here was himself , who controlled it all and to whom all the lines of this pattern led . Sub-LieutenantFerraby , Officer-of-the-Watch  --  he grinned suddenly501939 : Learningto himself , and felt , for a moment , almost heroic . No one in the bank would believe this . But he must write and tell Mavis about it , as soon as he could . She would believe it . The half-hourly relief of the bridge personnel interrupted this train of thought , setting the seal on his responsibility . " Port look-out relieved , sir ! " " Very good . " " Starboard look-out relieved , sir ! " " Very good . " And up the voice-pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Course north , ten west , sir  --  engine half ahead  --  Able Seaman Dykes on the wheel ! " " Very good . " At that moment he would not have been anywhere else in the world . Presently the signalman of the watch , who had been standing by his side staring through his binoculars , straightened up and said : " Flashing light to starboard , sir . " When Ferraby found the light he counted the flashes carefully . " That 's our next lighthouse , " he said , when he had made sure of it . " It 's still a long way ahead , though . " The signalman stamped his feet on the grating that ran the length of the fore-bridge , and said tentatively : " Bit cold up here , sir . " It was the first remark he had volunteered since they came on watch , and Ferraby looked at him out of the corner of his eye . He knew him by sight already : his name was Rose  --  a young , newly joined rating , younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signalman . He was something like Ferraby in manner , too : shy , unsure of himself , ready to believe most of what he was told in totally new surroundings . Earlier , at the change of the watch , Ferraby had heard Leading Signalman Wells handing over to him , using an encouraging , almost fatherly tone that must have been reassuring to a boy standing his first night duty . " Now you do n't need to get rattled , " Wells had said . " You know the challenge , and the reply , and that 's about all there 's likely to51The Cruel Seabe when we 're routed independently . But if we meet anyone , and there 's a signal , sing out for me straight away , and I 'll be up to give you a hand . " The contrast between this friendly backing , this verbal arm-round-the-shoulder , and the sort of thing he himself had to endure from Bennett , had been so marked that momentarily Ferraby had found himself wishing he could be an ordinary signalman , with Wells to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant bullying him all the time . But he was not so sure of that feelingnow , after half an hour in charge of the ship . If only it could always be like this . . . . He said : " Yes , it 's damned cold , " and feeling the need to lead the conversation , he added : " What 's it like below ? " " Warm enough , sir , " answered Rose . " But it 's very crowded . And the walls  --  " he corrected himself hurriedly , " the bulkheads sweat all the time . Makes everything wet through . It takes a bit of getting used to . " " Is this your first ship ? " " Yes , sir . " " How long have you been in ? " " A month , sir . Just the training . " " What were you before you joined ? " Rose hesitated , and then answered : " I helped with a van , sir . A van-boy . . . . A van-boy , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and meet Godknows-whathazards . . . . There was enough of a parallel between Rose 's change of status , and his own , for Ferraby to be conscious of a strong fellow-feeling with him . But was that a relationship encouraged by the Royal Navy ? He shied away from the thought and , hunching his shoulders which were stiffening with cold , said : " I wonder if we could get some tea ? " " There 's some cocoa on in the galley , sir , " Rose volunteered . " Shall I ask the bosun 's mate ? " " Yes , do . " The cocoa , when it came up , was sweet and strong and very comforting . They drank it together , side by side under52I 9 3 q : Learningthe cold sky , while beneath their feet the ship lifted gently to the swell , and the sea fell back from her cleaving bow and turned outward in a mile-long furrow , and their track was lost in the darkness astern . Later in the watch , a cluster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running into another bunch of the fishing boats that were all round the coast that night . This fleet of them lay directly on Compass Rose 's course , and he wondered if he ought to call the Captain : but his spell on the bridge had given him plenty of confidence , and on an impulse he bent to the voice-pipe and spoke his first helm-order . " Port ten . " The quartermaster 's voice answered him . " Port ten , sir . . . . Ten of port wheel on , sir . " " Midships . " " Midships . . . . Wheel 's amidships , sir . " " Steady . " " Steady , sir . . . . Course , north , twenty-five west , sir . " They held the new course for five minutes , till the fishing boats were abeam and well clear of them . Then he brought the ship back on her former course , and was just about to make a note of the manoeuvre in the deck-log when from the Captain 's voice-pipe there came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " answered Ferraby . " What were you altering for , sub ? " " A fishing boat , sir , " he said , compromising with the strict truth . " We 're clear of it now . " His surprise made him add : " How did you know , sir ? " He heard the Captain chuckle . " The steering engine makes a lot of noise down here . . . . Everything all right ? " " Yes , sir . The next light 's coming abeam now . " He waited for a comment , but none came , and presently a slight snore told him that he need not wait any longer . Obscurely , he felt rather proud of that snore . It was the most definite compliment he had had so far in the ship. 53The Cruel SectIt grew lighter : the sky imperceptibly paled : to the eastward , the land took on a harder outline , and beyond the nearest hills others began to come into view , their snowsummitswaiting to catch the first shafts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paled also , turning from black to a livid grey ; and a distant lighthouse , which had been beckoning them toward the horizon , struggled against the coming of daylight and faded till its beam was a faint , wan flicker against a mist of rising land . The whole length of the ship gradually emerged from a dark outline into a threedimensionaland solid structure with frost glistening all along the upper-works : on the bridge , figures and then faces came up sharp and clear  --  lined faces , grey with cold and fatigue , but relaxing now as the dawn cheered them . Below , the ship stirred and came to life , welcoming or accepting the end of the watch . The smoke from the galley chimney thickened , and bore with it a coarse and cheerful smell of frying : feet rang on ladders and along the iron deck : from a hatchway aft the grey bristly face of Chief E.R.A. Watts peered at the daylight as if scarcely believing in it . The first night at sea was over . Just before eight , Lockhart came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had had nearly four hours ' sleep and was feeling fresher than he had expected . " All alone ?

And to think that I slept peacefully through it all . . . . " He looked at the nearest point of land . " How far have we got ? " Ferraby , showing him their position on the chart , asked : " Are you taking over ? Where 's Number One ? " " Eating breakfast , " said Lockhart tonelessly . " Snorkers . Good-oh . " For a moment they stood side by side in the cold morning air . The sun was now just under the rim of the hills ; it was a lovely morning .

" Yes , it is. " roVice-Admiral Sir Vincent Murray-Forbes , K.C.11. , D.S.O. , Royal Navy , sat at his desk in the operations buildingoverlooking Ardnacraish harbour , playing despondently with a silver paper-knife engraved : " Presented to Lieutenant-CommanderV . Murray-Forbes , R.N. , on relinquishingcommand of H.M.S. Dragonfly . From the Ship 's Company . October 1909 . Good luck . " He did not see the engraved sentences : indeed , he had not read them for many years ; but they had a direct connection with his despondency , and especially the date , which was incontrovertible . It was something he carried with him always , like an unluckycharm ; for it meant , by inference , that he was in his sixtieth year , and too old to go to sea again . The Admiral looked what he was : an old sailor , and surely due for retirement after a lifetime of distinguished service in the Navy . It was a lined face , strong , tremendously wrinkled round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeves was impressive , and the rows of medal-ribbons seemed no more than the face deserved . The D.S.O. was Jutland , the K.C.B. represented a long and brilliant serial story , from C.-in-C . China to C.-in-C . Home Fleet and then to a notable shore appointment : the rest of the ribbons signified that he had managed to stay alive a long time in various odd parts of the globe . Too long , indeed , for his present peace of mind : the year 19 T8 , when he was captain in command of a destroyer flotilla , had been the peak of his fighting days , and now this new war had come too late for him to start them all over again . For though he had managed to defer his overdueretirement , it had not been for the reason that he had hoped. 55The Cruel SeaThey would not send him hack to sea . NOT REPEAT NOT TOO OLD , he wrote in firm capitals on the signal-pad in front of him , and then , as firmly , scored it out again . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Three months earlier , after intensive wangling , he had very nearly brought off the sea-appointment that he craved for ; but fifty-nine years could not be gainsaid , and the Sea Lord who was his personal friend had had to pass him by . Instead  --  " A most responsible job , " they reassured him : " a very important one , where your experience will be vital . " So the only sphere where he really wanted to use that experience  --  afloat  --  wasfinally closed to him : the best answer they could give him was Ardnacraish , destined to be the training base for every new escort in the Western ApproachesCommand . It was important  --  damned important  --  but it was n't what he wanted ; and now he looked at Ardnacraishand , with his eyes still turned back to that sea-going appointment , he cursed it roundly . Ardnacraish might have returned the compliment , though with less justice : what the Admiral had done to it had had the overriding sanction of war . But certainly there had been changes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village of two hundred inhabitants in the remote Highlands , with one inn , three shops , a slipway , and a small landlocked harbour : if you decided that it had to be turned into a naval training base , and transported there everything necessary for its establishment  --  huts , store-rooms , sleeping-quarters , gear and equipment of every sort : if you set up a signal tower and a radio station , laid a defence boom , deepened the harbour , and put down a line of mooring-buoys : if you drafted in a maintenance and training staff of seventy officers and men , and organized an additional floating population of two or three hundred sailors at a time from visiting ships  --  if you did all this , you got a certain result . It would probably be the result you wanted : but you could hardly expect a sweet unspoiledHighland village to be a residual part of it . Ardnacraish had been lovely : it would be lovely again , 1939 : Learningwhen the alien visitation was over ; but now it was a place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was patchwork , ugly , and unrecognizable . But it was his responsibility . . . . The Admiral looked out of the window at the harbour , across an intervening line of corrugated-iron roofs that housed the asdic and signal departments . There was , as usual , a brisk wind blowing : he could hear it rattling the ill-fitting doors of the other offices in the building , and he could see it ruffling its way across the harbour and sending small vicious waves slapping against the mooring-buoys . There were no ships in , at the moment , except the oiler and the tug attached to the base : the last one had left two days previously , and they were waiting for the next arrival , due that afternoon . She was to be a brand-new type , and the first of her class : a corvette  --  theatrical name , but an honoured one in naval history . He had her training program ready for her , and she would start it straight away . It was a stiff program , though an experimental one still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , and one hardly knew what the escorts would have to contend with . But there were certain things that all ships had to do and to be , whatever job they were intended for : as a fundamentalbasis , they had to be clean , efficient , and alert . In this , almost everything depended on their officers , and , judging by the last war , there were going to be some pretty odd officers before the thing was over . This ship , he noted , had an R.N.R. captain , which meant , at any rate , a seaman in command . . . . The others , amateurs , might be worth anything or nothing . The Admiral frowned . He would soon find out what they were worth , and what the ship was worth too : that was his job . He might be too old to take one to sea , but he was still a firm judge of what a ship should look like and how she should behave ; and however long the war lasted , and whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meet this lifelong standard . There was a knock on the door , and a signalman entered. 56 57The Cruel Sea I I9 39 : LearningThe Admiral looked up . " Well ? " " Compass Rose entering harbour now , sir . Lieutenant Haines said to tell you . " " Has he signalled her a berth ? " " Yes , sir . " The Admiral got up , and walked across to the window again . A ship was just entering the narrows , moving very slowly , edging sideways to offset the crosswind : as he watched her , she lowered a boat that began to make for one of the central mooring-buoys . His eyes went back to the ship , and he appraised her carefully . She was small , smaller than he had expected : rather chunky , but not ungraceful if you discounted the clumsy-looking stern and the mast plumb in front of the bridge . She looked clean  --  and so she damned well ought to be , fresh from the builders  --  and the hands were properly fallen in fore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pendant numbers , and a brand-new ensign . One gun on the fo'c's'le  --  a porn-porn aft  --  depth charges  --  nothingmuch else . . . . Something like an overgrown trawler . But she 'd have to do more than trawler 's work. 1 lc watched her securing to the buoy , neatly enough , and then he turned to the signalman . " Send a signal . Compass Rose from Flag-Officer-inCharge . Manoeuvre well executed . ' Then tell Lieutenant I laines to call away my barge . I 'm going aboard now . " 11For three weeks they worked very hard indeed . From the moment that the Admiral 's barge approached in a wide , treacherous sweep right under their stern and almost caught the Captain unawares , the ship 's company was in a continual state of tension . If they were not out exercising with the submarine , they were doing gun drill or running through Action Stations in harbour : if they were not fighting mock58fires or raising the anchor by hand , an urgent signal would order them to lower a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In between times , relays of men attended drills and lectures ashore : sometimes , with half the crew thus absent and their normal organization unworkable , a fearsome directive from the Admiral would set them to some manoeuvre that necessitated every available man tackling the nearest job , irrespective of his rating . Stokers would find themselves firing guns : seamen had to try their hand at hoisting flag-signals : telegraphists and coders , gentlemanly types , would take on the crude job of connecting up filthy oil-pipes from the oiler . " Blast the old bastard ! " said Bennett sourly , when some crisis or other found him hauling on a rope instead of watching other people do it : " I 'll be cleaning out the lavatories next . " Lockhart wished it might be true . . . . The three weeks ' ordeal was exhilarating , and profoundly good for the ship , as far as training was concerned : but there were occasions when they all felt due for a holiday , and none too sure that it would arrivein time . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windingup , for tuning to top pitch : they would have no other chance . Little by little the process advanced : the rough edges were smoothed off , the awkwardness of apprenticeship overcomeand then forgotten . It was a progress they all acknowledged , and welcomed : their ship was coming alive , and for that reason she was a better place to live in , a surer weapon to use . There would come a time , they began to realize , when alertness and a disciplined reaction to crisis might save all their lives ; if the price , now , were over-work and sometimesover-harshness , it was worth paying the score , and forgettingit as soon as it was paid . No weariness , no boredom , no grudge against authority , was worth setting against this ultimate survival . The measure of their progress was nowhere more apparent than during the trips they made to sea , on exercises with the submarine attached to the base . The main purpose of these trips was to try out the asdic gear  --  the anti-submarine de-59The Cruel Seatector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teamworkbetween the asdic operators , the depth-charge crews , and the Captain , which would be a vital element in their future effectiveness . In those early days , the asdic set was an elementary affair , not much more than a glorified echosounder , working horizontally all round the ship , instead of vertically down to the sea-bed ; but it was still a weapon of precision , it could still produce results if it were properly used . And certainly the hunts themselves , with a real , moving , elusive quarry to outwit , instead of the synthetic target that they practised on ashore , were the most exciting part of all their training . At first they had very little success . Bennett , Lockhart , and Ferraby all took turns at manoeuvring the ship during a hunt , and they all found the same inherent handicap  --  there were too many things to think about at the same time . The ship had to he handled , sometimes in bad weather that set her rolling like a metronome : the submarine had to be found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be controlled , and chivvied back onto the target if they showed signs of- wandering : the engine revolutions had to be altered , the correct signals hoisted , the depth-charge crews warned , the right button pressed at the right moment . And if they forgot one of these things , the whole attack collapsed and had to be written off as a failure , a foolish waste of time attended by a deplorable publicity . . . . It was no wonder that , during the preliminary exercises , each of them in turn developed stage fright , and did their best to cover it by a mixture of bluff and pretended indifference . Bennett , naturally , was by far the best at this : to listen to him , nothing moving below the surface had a chance of survival when he was Officer-of-the-Watch , and precious little on top . But gradually they improved : they learned various tricks and idiosyncrasies of the ship and the asdic set , they learned to anticipate what a hunted submarine would do next , they learned when it was safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before moving in any direction . Their wits sharpened , and their applied skill too . And finally there came601939 : Learninga day when in the course of six successive " runs " Compass Rose picked up the submarine each time and held it right down to the mock " kill " : when , indeed , the submarine , surfacing at the end of its last encounter after trying every device and every evasion , signalled to them : " You 're too good . Go away and try it on the Germans . " At that moment of small triumph , it seemed a very good idea  --  and anything else a waste of energy . The time was very near when they would outgrow the schoolroom altogether , and insist on tryingtheir armour on the adult world . They were confident that that armour would take a lot of denting Even Chief E.R.A. Watts , when tackled straight , would admit that Compass Rose was running sweetly enough , and that his engines , at least , were proving themselves robust , tireless , and dependable . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glories of the Repulse : on a smaller scale , Compass Rose had won his affection . There was one thing that did not improve , though they were busy enough to be able to ignore it most of the time : the situation in the wardroom . Ericson , watching his officers at work , was satisfied enough with their progress , from the professional angle : it was off duty , when they were isolated on board ( there was nothing for them to do ashore , even when they braved the winter cold in search of distraction ) , that the bickering and the ill-humour started up again , takingthe place of their working co-operation . It came to a head on one occasion , and he was forced to recognize it and to take action : he did so unwillingly , since discipline necessitatedhis admonishing the wrong man , but with the best will in the world he could not ignore a direct clash between Bennett and the other two . It started with Ferraby : most things did : he was now established as the vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain . He tried hard enough , he was still eager to make a success of it : but that eagerness was blunted and poisoned all the time by the knowledge that , whatever he did , Bennett would find fault with it . Given6iThe Cruel Seaany sort of encouragement , and an occasional word of approval , he might have measured up to the new standard of effectiveness that Compass Rose as a whole had reached  --  he was not by any means stupid , he was adaptable and enthusiastic , he wanted above all to give of his best/But since this giving always met with the same reception , since whatever he did was wrong , and the fact was pointed out to him in the crudest terms , it was no wonder that he slipped deeper and deeper into a miserable hesitation . He grew to loathe and to fear that rough voice , which might at any moment call out " Ferrabec ! " and then pick to pieces whatever he was trying to do ; and hesitation , loathing , and fear were not a compound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockhart saw what was happening , and did his best to stand in the way of Bennett 's rougher attacks : it was this effort to shield I " erraby that led to an open rupture . It took place in the wardroom , one night when Ferraby , as Officerof-the-Day , had come below again after evening Rounds . Though he had been up to the bridge , he had forgotten to check their anchor-bearings  --  a pure formality in this case , since there was no wind and in their sheltered harbour it would rake a tidal wave to make Compass Rose drag her anchor ; bur Bennett , seizing the occasion as usual , had made it the subject of a prolonged and brutal tirade that Ferraby accepted without protest . W hen he was finally and contemptuouslydismissed , and had left the wardroom , Lockhart , who had been a spectator , muttered something not quite under his breath . Bennett , who was standing by the sideboard pouring himself a drink , swung round . " What did you say ? " he snapped . Lockhart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he repeated more distinctly , " why do n't you leave him alone ? I le 's only a kid , and he 's doing his best/ " It 's not good enough . " " It would be if you gave him a chance . " Bennett slammed down his glass . " " That 's enough , " he said roughly . " You keep out of it . I do n't have to argue with you . " 62I 9 3 9 : Learning " You do n't have to argue with anyone , " said Lockhart moderately . " But ca n't you see that it 's no good going on at Ferraby like that ? It only makes him worse instead of better . He 's that sort of person . " " Then he 'd better change , pretty quickly , " sneered Ben nett . " He 's doing his best , " Lockhart repeated . " He 's not . He 's been no bloody use ever since I stopped him dipping his wick at Glasgow , and that 's been the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , and then said , with all the dispassion he could muster : " What a horrible man you are . " Bennett suddenly stiffened , his whole body rigid with fury . " Who the hell do you think you 're talking to ? " he shouted . " By God , you 'd better watch out , or I 'll land you in hell 's own trouble ! I 'll see you stay a sub-lieutenant for the rest of the war , for a start . " Lockhart , who had had the one extra drink that took him over the borderline of discretion , looked pointedly at the two rings on Bennett 's sleeve , and said : " I 'm not sure I want to be a lieutenant after all . " Bennett , now nearly beside himself , walked across the wardroom and stood over his chair . " One more crack like that , and I 'll report you to the Captain . " " Try it , " said Lockhart . He was beginning to feel fatalistic about the outcome of the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he knuckled under now it would cancel out the whole stand he had made . " Try it , " he repeated . " The Captain 's not such a bloody fool . I bet he knows how you treat Ferraby , at all events . " " He knows I treat Ferraby like that because Ferraby 's a lazy bastard who 's no bloody use to anyone . " Bennett focused a venomous look on Lockhart 's face , daring him to counter-attack . " And that 's about true of you , too . " " It 's not , " said Lockhart , stung out of his control at last . He abandoned caution . " We both do a damned sight more work than you , anyway . " 63The Cruel SeaAfter which , there was really nothing to do but put on his cap and follow Bennett up to the Captain 's cabin . The respectfulgaze of Leading Steward Carslake , who had been an enthralled audience and who now came out of the pantry to watch the tense procession go by , was sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only some vital exercise of authority could resolve it . But the subsequent encounter in the Captain 's cabin was an odd one , and less conclusive than either Bennett or Lockhart had expected . Ericson listened while Bennett put his case  --  fairly enough , since he was on impregnable ground ; but even on the admitted facts he could not really decide how to deal with it . I Ic had been expecting something of the sort for quite a long time , and now here it was : Lockhart had been a fool not to keep his temper , Bennett had been his natural unpleasantself -- and he , as Captain , had to find the right answer , with a strong bias towards the maintenance of discipline . But what sort of discipline did he want to maintain ? The ideal solution was to tell Lockhart to behave himself , and Bennett not to be so tough ; but that did not quite square with King 's Regulations , and it was the letter of the law that had to be appeased . The next best thing was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had an opening when Lockhart , in answer to a question about the origin of the row , said : " I think Ferraby gets a rough deal , sir . " " It 's not your concern whether someone else gets a rough deal or not , " Ericson cut in briskly . " You 've got your own job to do , without worrying how the First Lieutenant treats his officers . " " I realize that , sir . " Lockhart , standing formally to attention , was still sensitive to atmosphere , and he guessed the Captain 's dilemma ; but having come so far he did not want the whole situation to melt away in vague generalizations about minding one 's own business . " But if you think a friend of yours is being unfairly treated , the natural thing to do is to try and help him . " 19 3 9 : Learning " Is it ? " said Ericson ironically . " I should say that much the best plan was to keep clear of it , and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get this sort of argument , and "  --  he looked grimly at Lockhart  --  " argument between you and the First Lieutenant is something I 'm not going to stand for . " " I know that , sir . I got a bit worked up , and  --  " he was about to say he was sorry , but somehow he could not bring himself to form the words . Instead he finished : " I 'm not trying to get out of the consequences . But I do think that this sort of treatment "  --  he gestured towards Bennett  --  " is having an appalling effect on Ferraby . He just has n't an ounce of self-confidence left . " Bennett , without looking at him , said : " I do n't want any lectures on how to treat Ferraby . " Ericson glanced from one to the other  --  from Lockhart 's serious , determined face , pale under the electric light , to Bennett 's flushed self-confidence . Privately he thought : There 's no solution really  --  they 're just two unmixable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them in the mirror : it was tough , square , a competent barrier between two opposing forces . He looked , in fact , a lot more convincing than he felt ; he knew he was not handling this thing well , and it had to be handled perfectly , to dispose of it without a hang-over . The trouble was that he was dog-tired . The cabin , with its portholes closed since Darken Ship was piped five hours ago , was now stuffy and airless : they had had a long day at sea , and there was another one tomorrow . The Admiral 's habit of slipping aboard " to see how things were getting along , " without any more notice than the sight of his barge leaving the quay , was proving a constant source of irritation . Tonight , Ericson had not a great deal of energy left , and none at all for this sort of domestic upheaval . But he made another effort , seeking to deal with the thing in black-and-white terms , without subtlety , disregarding the gross cleavage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he began . " This has gone far enough , and it 's not going to go any further . It 's bad for you , and it's64 1 65The Cruel Sea ' I9 3 9 : Learningbad for the ship . " He looked at Lockhart . " I 'm not going to have you interfering like this in things that do n't concern you . Do you understand ? " " Yes , sir , " said Lockhart . On this basis , he was now ready to let it go : he had not won , but neither had Bennett  --  unless there was something more to come . Apparently there was nothing more . " Remember that , then , " said the Captain . " I do n't want to hear any more complaintsabout you , or I shall have to take some action  --  action you wo n't like . Now just forget about the whole thing . There 's plenty to do , without this sort of scrapping . " Ile stopped , and turned away : it seemed to be their dismissal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the matter was thus disposed of : what about the insolence , what- about Lockhart 's cracks , what about the denial of-authority ? He could not leave it like this . But he did not want to start things up again with Lockhart listening : it needed a less formal approach . He said : " May I have a word with you , sir ? " Ericson , who had been expecting it , said : " All right , Number One . " He nodded to Lockhart , who turned and left the cabin . " Well , " said Ericson , a shade less cordially , " what 's the trouble ? " " Sir , " said Bennett , " I think Lockhart got away with it . " Ericson , disregarding the temptation to answer : " I quite agree with you , " which would have been nearer the truth , said : " You 've got to make allowances , Number One . He 's a very new officer , and I think we 've all been working pretty hard . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think it will happenagain . " " I 've had a lot of trouble with Lockhart , " said Bennett aggrievedly . " I hoped you 'd pull him up , sir . He needs stamping on , good and hard . " Ericson looked at him , tense and sweating in the close cabin , and thought : One of these days someone is going to hit you , and that means a court-martial , all because you 're a tough character and have to show it all the time . He remembered a first mate rather like Bennett , back in the old66days in the Far East Line : foul-mouthed , ready with his fists , never giving an inch of ground or a word of praise . He 'd ended by killing his man  --  a Chinese seaman foolish enough to argue about some bad food . He 'd got off with manslaughter , but that had been the end of him . On a less dramatic plane , Bennett might go the same way  --  or bush someone else to it . There were people like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their crudity : it was bad luck that one of them had landed up in Compass Rose . He said , shortly : " I want to avoid having to stamp on people , as far as possible , Number One . There are other ways of getting them to work properly . " He felt like adding something about Ferraby , and the need to treat him less roughly , but perhaps Bennett had had enough hints for one evening . Instead he said : " Give Lockhart a fresh start , and see what he makes of it , " and then he turned away with a finality that even Bennett 's thick skin could not resist . This was a scene that might go on for ever : he had had enough of it . When Bennett had gone , his face registering the protest that had scarcely been allowed to come to life , much less to develop properly , Ericson walked out of his cabin , parted the thick blackout screens at the entrance to the companionway , and stepped onto the upper deck . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief : the night was clear , the little harbour easily seen , the small waves slapping against the ship 's side an endless accompaniment to their vigil . He looked up at the sky : wispy clouds round the moon promised some wind later , but tomorrow 's weather seemed as secure as their anchorage . Round him the familiar shipboardsounds were reassuring : the hum of the dynamos , the noise of a gramophone from the fo'c's'le , the clumping of the quartermaster 's sea boots as he made his rounds further aft  --  all these were part of a life and a moment he savoured to the full . Night in harbour , after a hard day 's work : there should be nothing to beat that . But he was not quite satisfied : the recent scene with Bennettand Lockhart had left a bad taste . There had been too67The Cruel Sea 1939 : Learningmany loose ends , though if he had tried to deal with them in detail it would have been far more serious for Lockhart . And then there was Ferraby , adrift in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never grew any bigger or any cleverer . . . . He shrugged , and turned back to his cabin , glad to leave it all till tomorrow . There was only one real cure , anyway : they had to stop fighting each other , and fight the enemy instead . Soon it was their last week at Ardnacraish , the end of their apprenticeship : the tuning-up process came to its full flower , and with it an access of confidence that reached all but the most unimpressionable elements . Professionally , they were sure of themselves : they knew their ship , they knew their jobs in her . Now , no matter what they were asked to do , no matter how the Admiral or his staff stalked them , no matter what odd signals made Leading Signalman Wells suck his teeth and Bennett start sweating and shouting , they felt they could cope with it . There were occasional mistakes , lacerating to the dignity  --  as when one of the fit'c's'le party broke the wrong shackle on the cable and dropped the anchor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty feet of water ; but these were odd setbacksin a continuous process , small pebbles in the stream . All in all , they had made a success of Ardnacraish ; even Fcrraby , now that Bennett seemed to be holding his hand and moderating his voice , was beginning to improve : unexpectedlybuoyant , he took a fresh lease and tried once more to fit himself in . . . . Compass Rose , eight weeks from the day she was commissioned , was now a working proposition , During the final week they had been joined by another corvette , the next off the assembly line . Her name was Sorrel , and her captain , Ramsay , was an old friend of Ericson 's ; her arrival was a cheerful occasion , adding to the arnenities of what was , in essentials , a bleak corner of the world . When they went out on trials with the submarine , Sorrel and Compass Rose hunted as a team , and this was another advantage , adding interest to exercises that were beginning topall : they took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship stood off and passed cross-bearings , advice , and , occasionally , the ribald comments of the more successful performer . It was a useful foretaste of what could happen in convoy , when any number of escorts might join in a hunt , and would have to learn to do this , and make an effective contribution , without getting in each other 's way . Compass Rose 's final exercise before she left was , appropriately , a practice-shoot at night . At dusk they said good-bye to Sorrel , who was returning to harbour , and then for an hour they cruised about off the south end of the island , waiting first for the tug that was to tow their target for them , and then for the coming of night . It was one of those evenings which show the Scottish Highlandsat their superb best : by good luck , their envoi from the peaceful world had a loveliness that they carried with them for many months afterwards . Sunset gave them a gold-andred-streakedsky : dusk gave them a subtle-coloured backclothfor the islands surrounding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from the hills in deep purple shadows that , reflected on the water round the ship , turned it to a sombre , royal hue . Then , in the deepening night , the hills were shut out altogether : the single light that marked the harbour entrance still stood guard for them , ten miles and more away , but that was the only element that bound them to the land . Alone on a dark noiseless sea , under a sky already pricked by the first stars , Compass Rose circled and lifted to the swell and waited for her rendezvous . Up on the bridge , the waiting was focused down to a few alert men : the Captain at the front of the bridge ; Lockhart , who was Officer-of-the-Watch , beside him ; Leading SignalmanWells leaning against his lamp and staring through his binoculars ; the two look-outs on the two wings completing the pattern . It was very cold : they felt it on their faces , they felt it on their stiff hands , they felt it in their legs and thighs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge were no protection : on their high platform , the waitTheCruel Seaing figures were simply part of the ship , bare to the weather , open to the sky . Suddenly Leading Signalman Wells , intent on something that had caught his eye on their beam , straightened up . " There she is , sir . Red eight-oh . " The vague blur to port resolved itself : under the growing moon , the tug emerged as a hard shape on the horizon , and the towed target as a black blob astern of her . Wells spoke again . " Calling us up , sir ! " He turned swiftly to the signalman of the watch , Rose , at the back of the bridge . " Take it down . . . . Compass Rose from Basher . ' " " What a singular name for a tug , " said Lockhart . " Gives you fair warning , " said the Captain . Lockhart smiled to himself . Now and again the Captain came out with a remark like that , disproving his professional inhumanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l'he dimmed signal-lights winked to each other across a mile of still water . " Signal , sir ! " said Wells presently . " From the tug : My course and speed , two-seven-oh , four knots . Length of tow , three hundred feet . Ready for you . ' " " Right , " said the Captain . " Make to them : On our first run we will close from four thousand yards and fire three rounds . Please signal hits . ' " ' l'he lamps winked again , flickering across the darkness as if glad to find each other . " Reply , sir : If any , ' " said Wells , without expression. " 1 lumourist , " said the Captain briefly . He bent to the voice-pipe . " Starboard twenty . Steer north . " And then , to Lockhart : " Sound off Action Stations . We 'll start this from the beginning . " The alarm bells , faintly and shrilly heard from below , set in motion a stirring , the length and breadth of the ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gun platform , crowding round the gun : Petty Officer Tallow confirmed his presence at the wheel : the voice-pipe from the quarterdeck reported that Sub-Lieutenant Ferraby had thedepth-charge partly closed up . As on so many occasions during the past three weeks , Compass Rose quickly came to life , filling in the gaps in her readiness , crowding the tipper deck with men who no longer blundered about or impeded one another as they moved , but who made swiftly fitr their stations as if they had been walking about in full daylight . The hours of drilling and practice were paying a dividend already ; if the future were to call upon it at a crucial moment , it was there , ready and available . Lockhart 's position at Action Stations was on the fo'c's'le , in charge of the gun : he had no sooner got there , clattering up the ladder in the darkness , and Leading Seaman Phillips had reported that the gun 's crew was closed up , than he felt Compass Rose tremble as she increased speed : the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to action . They loaded and stood ready , while the ship ran on over the dark water and the range shortened : then from the bridge came the shouted order : " Target bearing red fourfive  --  rangethree thousand  --  open fire ! " and from that moment the responsibility was his . Compass Rose had no refinementsin the way of gunnery : in action , as now , it was to be a matter of shouting , and then local control from the gun platform itself . Lockhart set the range , and waited until the gun-layer , straining his eyes against the darkness , reported that he had found the target : then he gave the order : " Shoot ! " He had never seen the gun fired at night : close to , the effect was almost stupefying  --  a violent crash , and then a great burst of flame and smoke that momentarily blinded him and made him gasp . Through his binoculars he watched for the fall of shot , and presently it came : a tall spout of water , a plume of spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but well short of it . " Up four hundred  --  shoot ! " Again the crash of the explosion , again the burst of flame , and the waiting for the shot to fall . This second time , accustomed to the noise , Lockhart could hear the shell whistlingThe Cruel Seaand whining away into the darkness after the first report . Now they were over the target : the range must be closing quicker than he had thought , or else the first shot had been a bad one , fired as they rolled . " Down two hundred  - -  - shoot ! " That was a good bracket  --  the spout of water was just short of the target . But that was the last round allowed to them he cease-fire gong sounded , and he called out : " Check , check , check ! " to confirm it . Then he stood back , as the gun was cleared , and smelt the reek of cordite , and heard Phillips mutter : " The next one would have sunk ' cm , " and Tilt suddenly excited and pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of crisis were wildly novel to him : he had never done anything like it before , but it did semi it really seemed  --  as if he had done quite well . . As if to confirm this , the Captain leaned over the edge of the bridge above him and said : " Not bad , Lockhart . Get ready for the next run . " The sound of Bennett disagreeably clearing his throat in the background need not , he felt , be given any weight as a comment. ' the second run was , by contrast , a resounding failure : it would not have frightened a rowing-boat . Their first shot fell short  --  so short , indeed , that Lockhart knew that the gun-layer had lost his head and fired on the forward roll , with the gun pointing downwards . The second was for some reason right out of line : he could , at a stretch , blame that on the quartermaster , who swung the ship off her steady course at the critical moment . The third fall , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might never have fired it at all , for all the evidence they had , though probably it had gone far over and been obscured by the target . And that was the end of that run . . . . The noise and activity now seemed a great deal less dramatic , and the reflective silence from the bridge a positive insult . He said under his breath to Phillips : " We 'll have to do better than this , " and Phillips answered determinedly : " We 'll do that , sir , " and started a blasphemous harangue of the gun 's crew , man by man . Lockhart , applying the principle of limited liability , 721939 : Learningwalked casually out of earshot . He had delegated his au thority , and it seemed to be in effective hands . The harangue must have been a good one , for their last run was by far the best . One sighting shot , a little short , and then " Up two hundred  --  shoot ! " and two hits plumb at the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to them , and this time the Captain said : " Good shooting , Lockhart , " and there was no repressive cough from Bennett . " Sink me the ship , Master Gunner , ' " Lockhart quoted aloud , slightly over-elated : " Sink her , split her in twain : Fall into the hands of God , not into the hands of Spain . ' " " Sir ? " said Phillips interestedly . " Poetry , " said Lockhart . " Sponge out , secure the gun , and then ask the leading steward to give you seven bottles of beer . " He had never felt better in his life : at that moment , standing on the gun platform while the crew worked and chattered in the darkness , he would have shaken hands with Bennett or joined the Navy for a twelve-year stretch . It was past midnight when they entered harbour : since it was the last exercise in their program , and the morrow was a genuine holiday , the late hour did not matter . Compass Rose , moving very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost slipping back to its lair , at some dead hour before the cock crew and ghosts must walk no more . The defenceboom had been kept open for them , but nothing stirred as they slid by it and went gently up toward their buoy . The moon was still high , and every outline was clear : the bay had a silvery rim to it , marking the limits of their refuge , giving it a containing margin . They moved past the oiler , past the sleeping Sorrel with her shaded stern-light , and then , foot by foot , up to their mooring . Standing in the eyes of the ship , torch in hand , Lockhart called out directions to the bridge , while the beam of the torch sent odd wavering reflections of the water along their hull . Compass Rose inched her way forward and came to a stop , her bows overhanging the buoy : Lockhart bent his shaft of light downward , picking out the white face of the rating perched on the buoy , and the wire , with the spring-73The Cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then he turned and called out : " Hooked on , sir ! " to the bridge : and they were at rest , and his part in the day was over . A few minutes later the moorings were properly secured : the telegraph bell , faintly heard , which meant " Main engine finished with , " set the seal on their arrival . The slack of the cable ran out noisily , starring up a hollow echo from the cliffs , and Leading Seaman Phillips , speaking out of the darknessto no one in particular , said : " I bet that wakes the Admiral . " There was a small ripple of laughter from the fo'c's'le men : Lockhart wondered if Phillips had already drunk his beer . Then he took a last look at the moorings , and said : " All right  --  that 'll do , " and followed his party across the dark fo'c's'le and down the ladder . He was stiff and tired ; but the last day had been the best , and Compass Rose , swinging to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccountably loved. 72 Once more , Vice-Admiral Sir Vincent Murray-Forbes sat at his desk in the operations building overlooking the harbour . Now he was writing a report : it was one of hundreds of reports , on ships and men , that he was to write , month in and month out , until the end of the war : on ships destined to be sunk or to survive , on men marked for killing , or for honour at the King 's own hands . He did not know what lay in store for these ships or these men : it would not have made an atom of difference if he had been writing an epitaph on men due to be drowned tomorrow . He was concerned only with facts ; and of these he had mustered a great many , duringthe past three weeks . " H.M.S. Compass Rose , " he wrote , in an old-fashioned , somewhat laborious longhand , " completed her program of training on February 2 , 1940 , and may be regarded as having74I 9 3 9 : Learningpassed out satisfactorily . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generally efficient . Further attention should be given ( a ) to fire fighting , which was below the requisite standard of speed , and ( b ) to the drill for Abandon Ship , which did not go smoothly on the only occasion on which it was tested . But with these reservations , the organization of H.M.S. Compass Rose now meets the high standard necessary to a ship engaged in the exacting task of convoy escort . " He consulted a batch of reports from his staff . " Gunnery , " he wrote , as a sub-heading , and underlined it . " " 1'hc single four-inch gun which is the sole major armament of this class of ship will only be adequate if constant attention is given to gun drill and to ammunition supply . H.M.S. Compass Rose did well in her various gun-trials , and the night-shoot was successful , both as regards the handling of the ship and the actual firing . Anti-aircraft shooting , conducted with a towed streamer-target , was less successful : it is recommendedthat more provision be made for anti-aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Asdics , " he went on , and underlined again . " On her arrival , H.M.S. Compass Rose was inadequately trained in this branch , and the Anti-Submarine Control Officer and the asdic ratings were clearly in need of intensive practice . When this had been provided , her efficiency improved rapidly , and she developed an effective anti-submarine team . Communication between the bridge and the depth-charge parties aft is still inadequate in this class of vessel : attention is drawn to my No. 242/17/1/40 , addressed to Admiral Superintending Contract-Built Ships ( repeated to C.-in-C . W.A. ) in which various improvements are suggested . " Depth-Charge Organization , " he wrote . " Only constant practice will bring the depth-charge crews up to the high standard of efficiency necessary in this branch . Time-tests of reloading and firing were generally disappointing , and it is emphasized that speed and accuracy may be vital here when the ship is in action .

His department improvedduring the latter stages of H.M.S. Compass Rose 's course of training . " The Admiral drew a thick line under his report , and blottedit neatly . Then he added , at the bottom : " Addressed , Commander-in-Chief , Western Approaches : copies to Flag-Officer-in-Charge , Glasgow : Admiralty ( C.W. Branch ) : H.M.S. Compass Rose . " Then he sat back , and rang for his secretary . X13Ericson , at ease in his cabin , read his copy of this report with some satisfaction and a good deal of amusement . The Admiral had come well up to standard , by way of farewell : it was a perfect picture of Number One , despite the limits of official phraseology , and he liked especially the crack about Lockhart and " dress regulations "  --  Lockhart having mislaid his cap on one crucial occasion and greeted the Admiral with something between a wave and a bow .

" To Commander-in-Chief , Western Approaches , from Compass Rose . Your 0939 stroke four stroke two acknowledged . ' And send it off straight away . So they went to war. 78P A R T T W O1940 : SkirmishingIThe war to which they went had hardly settled down , even in broad outline , to any recognizable pattern . The liner Athenia had been torpedoed and sunk , with the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the war : the first U-boat sinking , to offset this ruthless stroke , was on September 14 . Thus , at the beginning , the pace was hot  --  forty ships were sunk during that first September , and two fine warships , Courageous and Royal Oak , both went to the bottom before the turn of the year ; but the pace did not last . The casualties had been mostly independent ships that happened to be at sea when war was declared ; like the Athenia , they were in the wrong place at the wrong time ; but with the growth of the convoy system this chance ill-fortune could be avoided , and ships and shipping companies were quick to see that any effort to remain in convoy , instead of straggling behindor charging proudly ahead of the pedestrian field , was worth while . The U-boats were on the offensive  --  that was their role  --  but it was not a co-ordinated attack , nor even a very efficient one . Probably there were not more than a dozen of them at sea at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they hunted alone . They hung about off the coasts of Scotland and Ireland , and in the Bay of Biscay , on the look-out for stray ships that they could pick off at leisure ; it was a series of individualforays  --  sometimes successful , sometimes a waste79The Cruel Seaof time : the co-ordination and the control were to come later , and in the meantime the whole thing was unpredictable and rather amateurish . Britain was short of escorts , Germany was short of U-boats : the Atlantic was a very big ocean and , in winter weather , the finest hiding-place in the world . It was indeed like a game of hide-and-seek , played by a few children in an enormous rambling garden , with the light sometimes fading and the grown-ups calling out directions intermittently . And if some of the children were vicious and cruel , and pinched you when you were discovered , that was nothing unexpected in a nursery world . Such was the battlefield of the Atlantic , when 1940 dawned . The danger was there , but the two sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing their luck instead of their skill . To join this untidy battle , Compass Rose sailed early in the year. 2Their first convoy was a bloodless skirmish , as were many others in that momentary lull ; but it was a useful foretaste of what was to come , as well as a proving of the ship in weather worse than they had yet met . The sun was out as they sailed down into Liverpool Bay , on that fine February morning , to meet their convoy : it had pierced the early mist , melted the frost of their cold night passage , dried out their clothes with a cheerful warmth . Ericson knew the port well  --  he had lived there for ten years , and had sailed in and out of it scores of times : he looked for the familiar landmarks with an affectionate eagerness . As usual the first sight of land was the tall Blackpool Tower , away to the north : then the Bar Light Vessel , riding uneasily in the jumble of tide-ripped water that marked the entrance to the River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoke up-river , the twin spires of the Liver Buildings ; , 80I 940 : Skirmishingin the heart of the city . Somewhere there , in a little house on the Birkenhead side , Grace was undoubtedly knitting . . . . He had a moment 's pang that they should be so near to each other and yet be unable to meet ; and then he forgot it altogether . Five miles ahead of them their ships were coining out ; they were led by a destroyer  --  an old V. and W. ( : lass , which must be Viperous  --  already giving them the " interrogative " on her signal-lamp . While Leading Signalman Wells was replying , first makingCompass Rose 's number and then taking down a long signal about the organization of the convoy , Ericson studied the line of ships coming toward them . They were of all shapes and sizes : tankers , big freighters , small ships that would surely have been better off in the coasting trade than trying the hazards of an Atlantic passage . Some were deep-laden , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they steamed in single file from the narrow Mersey channel : their pendants flew bravely in the sunshine , they seemed almost glad to be putting to sea again . . . . That could hardly be true , thought Ericson with a smile , remembering the tearful good-byes , the hangovers , the feeling of " Oh-God-here-we-go-again " that attended every sailing ; but there was something about the file of ships  --  forty-six of them  --  that suggested a willingness to make the voyage , a tough confidence in the future . There were U-boats in the way of that voyage , of course  --  or so it was said , because most ships and most men in that convoy had yet to meet one : there was , at any rate , a threat to use U-boats . Thus , as well as being important for these ships to sail to Boston and New York and Halifax and Rio , it was essential , as a simple matter of principle as well , that they should get through . The Atlantic had never been specificallya British ocean ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now was not the time for it to change its nationality . Ferraby , hanging about at the back of the bridge ( it was not his watch ) was more stirred by the sight of those ships than he had ever been before . He liked everything about this convoy : he liked its air of purpose as it cracked on speed8aThe Cruel Sea , 1940 : Skirmishingafter the cautious passage down-channel : he liked individual ships  --  particularly the tough and shapely tankers : he liked the men on board who waved cheerfully to Compass Rose as she passed down the line towards the tail of the convoy . This sort of thing  --  this moment of significance and determination , this comradeship , this sea-brotherhood  --  was what he had had in mind when , at the training establishment , he volunteered for corvettes : there had been times when it had seemed impossible of attainment , when he was convinced that he was going to be fobbed off with a third-rate drama of pretence and frustration : now he knew that all his wishes were coming true. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain voyage : here was Compass Rose , appointed to guard them : here was Ferraby himself , a watchkeeping officer  --  or practicallyso  --  charged specifically with a share of that guardianship . I lis pale face flushed , his expression set in a new mould of determination , Ferraby surveyed the convoy with pride and a feeling of absolute proprietorship . Our ships , he thought : our cargoes , our men . . . . None would be surrendered , of this convoy or of any other , if it depended on any effort of his . Fcrraby 's eyes were new , and took a good deal on trust : other eyes  --  Ericson 's among them  --  were not new , and to them , it must be admitted , the convoy was somewhat more impressive than the escort , which reflected perfectly the pinched circumstances of the Royal Navy at this stage . To shepherd these forty-six ships through waters that were potentially the most treacherous in the world , there had been provided one fifteen-year-old destroyer , of a class that , though valiantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slender for the Atlantic weather : two corvettes  --  one a prewar edition of crude design , the other Compass Rose ; a trawler ; and a rescue tug that already , in the sheltered waters of Liverpool Bay , was bouncing about like a pea on a drum . Five warships  --  four and a half would be nearer the truth  --  to guard forty-six slow merchantmen was not a reassuringprospect for the experts on either side . . . . But82there it was : the best that could be done . And since there were no more ships to be had , something else would have to fill the gap : skill and luck must somehow bring about what a rational probability could not hope to effect . Compass Rose was kept busy all that afternoon . It meant a long day for the Captain , who had been on the bridge since first light ; but certainly he could not leave it now , when there was really no one else who could be trusted to handle Compass Rose in close company with other ships . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge , drinking successivecups of tea and giving endless helm-orders , while they worked through the various tasks that Viperous had set ' them . First they had to see that all the ships had sailed , checking their names and numbers against the long list that had been signalled to them : then they had to round up the stragglers and coax them into a closer formation : then  --  most trying of all  --  they had to pass a verbal message over the loud-hailer to each of the forty-six ships , and , since it concerned an important alteration of their course during the night , make absolutely sure in each case that the instructions had been understood . Over and over again they repeated that message : first the Captain , then Lockhart ( who had the afternoon watch ) , then Leading Signalmen Wells , then the Captain again . Some ships were deaf , and needed endless repetitions : some were foreign , and had to summon a man from the depths of the stokehold to take the message : some were having their afternoon sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same bad dream . " God Almighty ! " said Ericson at one point , when five minutes ' hailing of a big tanker had produced nothing more than a vague salute from a man in a bowler hat on the bridge : " You 'd think they wanted to get lost tonight . Try them again , sub . " " Hallo , Number Thirty-Two , " Lockhart called wearily through the loud-hailer . " Hallo , Number Thirty-Two . I have a message for you . Take it down , please . " 83The Cruel SeaThe tanker ploughed on , while Compass Rose kept jaunty pace with her , like a Pekinese harbouring designs on a greyhound . " Can we use the siren , sir ? " asked Lockhart . " They do n't seem to hear the human voice . " " We 'll use the gun in a minute . " Ericson grasped the wire and blew a prodigious blast on the siren . The man in the bowler hat walked to the wing of the bridge and stared at them . " Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockhartcalled out swiftly . " Take it down , please . " The man on the tanker cupped his hand to his ear . " Oh God , the bastard 's deaf , " said Lockhart despairingly , forgetting that the hailer was still switched on . The crisp comment boomed across the intervening thirty yards of water , and evidently found its mark : the man took his hand down and shook his fist at them instead . " You 've hurt his feelings , sub , " said the Captain . " Mistake , sir  --  sorry . " Lockhart was indeed considerably taken aback by what he had done , and when next he spoke he tried to make amends by assuming a winning tone : through the loud-hailer , it sounded revolting , like a dance-band crooner wooing the customers . " Message for you , Number Thirty-Two . Important alteration of course . Please take it down . " In answer the man on the tanker raised a megaphone and shouted to them . Faintly over the water came the words : " Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Trade . " Then he went inside and shut the door of the bridge-shelter firmly behind him . They had to wait until the change of the watch brought a new man to the bridge , before they could attract any further attention at all . That first night with the convoy was a restless affair that gave them very little sleep . They were still organized on a two-watch basis  --  that is , the Captain and Ferraby alternated with Bennett and Lockhart , four hours on and four hours off. 1940 : SkirmishingIt was a trying arrangement at the best of times , hard on the endurance and the temper : even if they could fall asleep as soon as they came off watch , they had to wake and dress and climb up to the bridge again , almost before they had turned over . But this was not the best of times , and Compass Rose far from a restful place when they were off duty . The wind was rising , and the Irish Sea with it : the ship responded to the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were being paid by the hour for her travail . In the noisy turmoil between-decks , sleep was barely possible , even to men already dog-tired . There were other things . An aircraft , flying low over the convoy , brought them needlessly to action stations at two o'clock in the morning : one of their ships , straggling in the rear ( where Compass Rose was stern escort ) , needed constant chivvying to keep it in touch with the main body . Their progress was dishearteningly slow : Chicken Rock Light , at the south end of the Isle of Man , was their mark for so long that at times it was difficult to believe that they would ever leave it behind and reach the open sea . Altogether , the first night at their appointed job was not reassuring : if it could be as trying as this , with no enemy to fight and only a few odd incidents to contend with , what would it be like when they met the real ordeal ? There was no answer to this question ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen days , which was the durationof the trip . But soon , in any case , they forgot to wonder about it : they had enough to deal with , in the simple course of nature . The second day saw them make more tangible progress , northwest between Scotland and Northern Ireland ; and nightfall gave them , as their last sight of land , the lovely rain-washed hills of the Mull of Kyntyre , and Islay away to the north . Then they turned due westward , to ther open sea and the teeth of the wind , and the deep-sea voyage had begun . As a final introduction to it , U-boats were reportedin the area immediately ahead . They never met those U-boats , which were doubtless thankful enough to stay submerged and escape the fury ofThe Cruel Sea 1940 : Skirmishingthe weather ; for it was the weather that was the most violent enemy of all . For eight days they steamed straight into a westerly gale : five hundred miles at a grindingly slow pace , buffeting through a weight of wind that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The convoy was dispersedover more than fifty square miles : the escorts were out of touch most of the time : it was impossible to establish any sort of " convoy speed " because they were no longer a composite body , just a lot of ships making the best they could of the vile Atlantic weather . The big ships in the van slowed down till they had almost lost steerageway , and tried to preserve some sort of order ; but the smaller ones still straggled away behind , virtually heaving-to at the height of the gale and often having to steer many degrees off their true course , simply in order not to batter themselves to pieces . On the eighth day , Viperous , which had had a very bad time and had lost two men overboard , signalled : " Convoy disperse  --  proceed independently " : in the circumstances , the signal had an irony that they were scarcely in the mood to enjoy . The escorts collected : Viperous with damage to her bridge superstructure , the old corvette minus one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trawler ridingwell , the tug tossing about with a ludicrous , almost hystericalviolence as she tried to keep pace with the rest . They had a rendezvous with the incoming convoy , and they found it  --  somehow : in that wilderness of wind and rain , with visibility hardly more than five hundred yards at any time , they found the single pinpoint in mid-Atlantic that brought them up with the ships they were waiting for . It was navigationof a very high order ; it had been Viperous 's responsibility , and Ericson , with years of experience behind him , found himself watching Viperous 's bridge rolling through a sixty-degree arc , and wondering , somewhere between amazementand deep admiration , how on earth her captain had managed it . Taking sights and fixing their position , under these conditions , was very nearly impossible : somehow it86had been done , and done with the absolute accuracy of fleet manoeuvres in calm weather . They turned for home , with the new convoy of thirty-odd ships that , in the better weather to the westward , had managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce wind behind them , it was more uncomfortable still ; and another U-boat alarm involved " evasive routing " that took them many miles off their proper course and kept them nearly two days extra at sea . Aboard Compass Rose , conditionswere indescribable . She rolled furiously , with a tireless malice allowing of no rest for anyone . Cooking was impossible , even had they not exhausted their fresh meat and vegetables many days previously : the staple diet was tea and corned beef , at breakfast , lunch , and dinner , for nearly a fortnight on end . Everything was wet through : some water had come down a ventilator and flooded the wardroom : forward , the mess-decks were a crowded hell of saturated clothes , spare gear washing about round their feet , food overturned  --  andall the time the noise , the groaning slamming violence of a small ship fighting a monstrous sea . There seemed no end to it . Compass Rose , caught in a storm that could take hold of her bodily and shake her till the very rivets loosened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never blew itself out until they were in the shelter of the land again : Compass Rose , adrift on this malignant ocean , seemed doomed to ride it for ever . Bennett , disliking the experience they were all sharing , said so with honest persistence . He was now the most vocal of the wardroom , complaining with an ill-temper coloured by a real uneasiness : the rotten ship , the lousy convoy , the bloody awful weather  --  these were the sinews of an unending dirge that was really grounded in fear . Like the others , he had never seen weather like this , or imagined it possible : he knew enough about ships to see that Compass Rose was going through a desperate ordeal , but not enough to realize that she was built to survive it , and would do so . He doubted their87The Cruel Seasafety , and doubt was translated by a natural process into anger . He had made a fool of himself over working out their position , too  --  so much so that the Captain , taking the sextantfrom him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'd rather do it myself " : it had not helped matters . He should have done something about getting the mess cleared up in the fo'c's'le , but he could n't be bothered . He should somehow have organized at least one hot meal a day , even if it were only warmed-up tinned beans : the galley fire was unusable , but with a little ingenuity it could have been done in the engine room . This , again , was more trouble than he was prepared to take . Instead , he sulked , and shirked , and secretly longed to he out of it . Not much more of this for him , he decided : there were other ways of winning the war . . . . It was all so tiring , too : if he had n't been able to hand the watch over to Lockhart , and get forty winks now and again , he 'd have been out on his feet . Lockhart was desperately tired , and rather numbed , for nearly all that voyage . His thin wiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not yet accustomed to staying awake and alert when every nerve under his skin was crying out for sleep , and bitter cold and wakefulness were all that the present offered . Bennett might shirk his watch , spending most of it inside the asdic shelter : he himself could not do so . Four hours on , and four off , for seventeen days at a stretch  --  that was his share : and the hours " on " were an unending strain , trying his eyes and his tired body to the limit . And when he stumbled down the ladder at the end of his watch , there was little relief to be had : tea and corned beef in the shambles of the wardroom , with water washing about all over the place and the furniture lashed together in one corner , and then the effort to sleep , wedged in his bunk against the endless rolling of the ship , with the light left burning in case of an alarm , and the thought , nagging all the time , that he must get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours . When he did face it again , and felt the gale881.94o : Skirmishingwhipping and tearing at his face and clothes , and Compass Rose lurching under his feet as if the world itself were drunk , it was with a body from which every instinct save a dumb endurance had been drained . There was one night he remembered especially , toward the end of the trip , when the wind had veered to the north and the gale was at its height . A gigantic sea was running at them from the beam : Compass Rose would rise to it as if she were going up in a lift , balance herself uneasily at its peak , and then fall away into the trough of the wave with a wicked sideways roll . Sometimes the next wave , towering up in its turn , would catch them as they lay there sluggishly , and beat down on them before they could rise . That was the moment when the heart quailed : when solid tons of water fell with a thunderous drumming on the bridge and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wind-driven and cutting . The storm was indeed incredibly noisy : the water crashed and thudded against their side , the wind howled at them out of the blackness as if it had a conscious intention of terror . Round them was nothing but a waste of sea , a livid grey whipped up here and there to white foam ; and then beyond it , like a threatening wall , the surrounding dark , the chaos and flurry of the night . With Bennett dozing inside , Lockhart was clinging to the rail in one corner of the bridge , staring through misted binoculars at the single merchant ship on which he was keepingstation . He was wet through , and cold to the bone : his feet inside the sodden sea boots squelched icily whenever he moved : from the pinched skin of his face the water ran down , riming his eyes and lips with salt . He felt little resentment against Bennett , who should really be doing this job : he had a general disgust that someone nominally his senior should be content to evade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really feeling too remote from personalities to care . For him , the world had resolved itself into a storm , and a small blur to leeward of Compass Rose : the blur was a ship that he must not lose , and so , for hour after hour , he nursed Compass Rose in her station , altering the engine revolutions , 89The Cruel Seaedging over when the blur faded , and away again when it loomed too large . He was roused at one point from this tremendous concentrationby someone nudging him , and he turned round to see a figure in the darkness beside him . " Who is it ? " he asked . It could hardly be Bennett . " Coxswain , sir , " said a voice . " Hallo , coxswain ! Come to see the fun ? " " Just for a bit of air , sir . " They both had to shout : the wind caught the words on their very lips and whipped them away into the night . " I brought a mug of tea up , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratefully , he added : " It 's got a tot in it . " Tea and rum . . . . When Lockhart bent down to shelter behind the rail , and took a sip , it ran through him like fire : it was the finest drink he had ever tasted . He was oddly moved that Tallow should have taken the trouble to make tea at two o'clock in the morning , add a tot of his own rum , and negotiate the difficult climb up to the bridge with it . I le could not see Tallow 's face , but he divined a sympathy in his manner that was nearly as warming as the drink . " ' Thanks , coxswain , " he said when he had finished it . " I needed that . " He raised his binoculars again , confirmed that Compass Rose was still in station , and relaxed slightly . " What 's it like below ? " " " Terrible , sir . Could n't be worse . It 'll take us a week to get straight , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lockhart , though he did not feel that very acutely . " Two or three days , and we 'll be in shelter . " " Ca n't be soon enough for me , sir . Proper uproar , this is . A lot of the lads wish they 'd joined the Army instead . " They talked till the end of the watch , shouting at each other against the storm . Lockhart was glad of the company : it was a tiny spark of warmth and feeling in a furious and inhuman onslaught . They would need a lot of that , if the Atlantic were going to serve them like this in the future. 1940 : SkirmishingPhysically , Ferraby was in a worse way than any of them . He had been acutely seasick during most of the voyage , but he never gave in to it : always , when it was time for him to go on watch , he would drag himself up the ladder , his face the colour of a dirty handkerchief , and somehow last out the four hours on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force himself to eat , and be sick once more , and lie down on his bunk , waiting for sleep to blot out the clamour of the storm , and his misery with it . Often sleep would not come , and he lay awake throughout his time off watch . Those were the worst moments of all , when doubt as to whether he could go on with this job pressed on his consciousness like a living weight of guilt . Toward the end , the strain nearly proved too much for him . This was particularly so when he had to go on watch at night , after an hour or so of sleep snatched in the stuffy heaving cabin . He would get into his sea boots and duffle coat , listening to the sounds of the storm outside , and the thud of water hitting the side of the ship and the deck overhead . Then he climbed slowly up the ladder , tired beyond belief , fearing the wind and the misery waiting for him up on the bridge : watching the square of dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gale was passing . He was very weak , and without any will except to last out this watch , and the next one , and a few more until they made harbour . Once , he stopped halfway up the ladder , and found himself crying . " Mavis , " he said  --  and went on , as if his wife had answered him from somewhere up above . He bore his ordeal alone , bravely : his set white face invitednothing save the kindness of ignoring it . He did not give in , because to fail to go on watch , to confess his defeat , would have been worse than any seasickness , any fatigue , any wind or rain or fury . There was no way out that was not shameful ; and that was no way out . The Captain carried them all . For him , there was no fixed watch , no time set aside when he was free to relax and , if he could , to sleep . He had to con-90 91The Cruel Seatrol everything , to drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to fix their position , to keep his section of the convoy together , to use his seamanship to ease Compass Rose 's ordeal as much as possible . He was a tower of strength , holding everything together by sheer unrelenting guts . The sight of the tall tough figure hunched in one corner of the bridge now seemed essential to them all : they needed the tremendous reassurance of his presence , and so he gave it unstintingly , even though the hours without sleep mounted to a fantastic total . He was tired -- - he could not remember ever having been so tired  --  bur he knew that he was not too tired : there were alwaysreserves . . . . It was part of the job of being captain , the reverse side of the prestige and the respect and the saluting : the tiny ship , the inexperienced officers , the unbelievable weather  --  he had taken these on as well , and they would not defeat him . So he dealt with everything that came , assuming all cares out of an overflowing strength : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might in the future become considerable assets to him but at the moment were not very much help  --  and the professional job , at sea , was not without its rewarding pride . It had to be done , anyway : he was the man to do it , and there was no choice and no two answers . They grew , almost , to love him , toward the end of the voyage : he was strong , calm , uncomplaining , and wonderfullydependable . This was the sort of captain to have : Compass Rose could have done with nothing less , and CompassRose , butting her patient way homeward under the blows of the cruel sea , was lucky to have him . No voyage can last for ever , save for ships that are sunk : this voyage ran its course , and presently released them . There came an afternoon  --  the afternoon of the sixteenth day  --  when the horizon ahead was not level , but uneven : not the pale grey of the sky , but the darker shadow that was the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them onward : their rolling lessened as they came under the92I 940 : Skirmishinglee of the northern coastline : presently , toward dusk , they were in shelter , and running down toward the home port that promised them rest and peace at last . It was difficult to realize that the worst was over , and that Compass Rose , on a steady keel , could become warm and dry again : it was difficult to believe in the relaxation that had been so relentlessly denied them . It must be an illusion , or a swindle : probably the Irish Sea would open up at the other end , and they would find themselves in deep water once more , fighting another round of the same exhausting battle . They had been on trial for so long that the acquittal did not seem to ring true . So the first convoy ended . It had been a shock  --  the more so because of the doubt , in the background , as to how they would fare in action with U-boats , if action were added to so startling an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away : that night , tied up alongside the oiler after seventeen days of strain , they were all so utterly exhausted that a dead and dreamless sleep was all they were fit for. 3It seemed that they were to be stationed permanently at Liverpool , and there they settled down , as part of the LiverpoolEscort Force that was gradually being built up . The centre of naval activity was Gladstone Dock , down-river and away from the town : it was already crowded with destroyersand sloops , and the corvettes that were now beginning to leave the shipyards in substantial numbers . The forest of masts , the naval parties moving on the dockside , and the huts and store-rooms put up for their use , were all heartening symptoms of a growing escort strength ; but they were matched by a steady increase in the number and size of convoys , which made demands on the naval potential almost impossible to meet . It was clear that many chances would93The Cruel Seahave to be taken with the safety of merchant ships , for a long time to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , delayed at Ardnacraish by some clash with the Admiralthat she was not particularly ready to discuss , joined her sister ship soon after their second convoy . Ericson was not notably pleased that Compass Rose was based on Liverpool ; in fact , he was inclined to resent the fact , without being too sure why . The theory was admirable : they came in from a convoy , and there was Grace , knitting away in her little house across the river and waiting for him . But it was an undeniable distraction , at a time when he wanted to concentrate exclusively on the ship : and , in some indistinct way , it seemed to be cheating  --  he had embraced a hard life and an exacting job , and here now was another embrace , to make things pleasant after all . . . . He could not have said why he found that wrong , and certainly he never hinted anything of the sort to her ; but it was a fact that he preferred to live on board when they were in harbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing so . " I'he man it suited most was Tallow : his home also was in Birkenhead , just over the river from Gladstone Dock , and he had no false not ions as to the relative comforts of Compass Rose and No. 29 , I ) ock Road . . . . It was a home he shared with his widowed sister Gladys , who had kept house for him ever since her husband died , four or five years previously : whenever he came back on leave , his room was waiting for him , and a cheerful welcome as well . Gladys Bell ( Bell had been a postman ) worked in a Liverpool office , supplementing a tiny pension : she was fortyish , plain , goodnatured , and she and Tallow got on very well together , in an undemanding sort of way . He had hoped that she would marry again , even though he would lose thereby ; but there had never been any sign of it , and by and by the idea ceased to worry him .

" " We 're in for a bit , " he said . " It 's our home port  --  could n't be better . " " Well , that 's nice . " Her mind darted immediately to the larder , wondering what she could give him on his first night ashore . " Have you had your tea ? " " Tea ? " he smiled mockingly . " Have you ever known me have my tea on board , when I can get your cooking just by crossing the river ? " There was a hesitant cough behind him in the doorway . " Oh , " said Tallow awkwardly . " Brought a friend , Glad . Chief E.R.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , " she said , when they had shaken hands and mumbled to each other . " This kitchen 's not fit to be seen . " In the front parlour , she lit the gas : the overcrowded room sprang to life , as if the hissing noise had been a stage direction . It was the best part of the shabby old house , carefully cleaned and cherished : the creaking wing-chairs were comfortable , the mahogany table sat four-square and solid in the middle , the ornaments were mostly souvenirs brought home by Tallow himself , from Gibraltar and Hong Kong and Alexandria . Lace curtains gave them a genteel privacy , at the cost of three quarters of the available light : from the mantelpiece , Tom Bell the postman regarded them importantly , as if he carried registered letters for each one of them . Gladys turned from the flaring gaslight , and looked at the two men with pleasure . They were both very smart  --  spotlessjackets , gold badges , knife-edge creases to their trousers : she found herself wondering , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes so nice , in the cramped quarterson board . " How 's the new ship ? " she asked her brother . The two men exchanged glances , before Tallow answered : 95The Cruel Sea " She 'll never live to be old , I 'd say . " Watts laughed , scratching his bald head . " That 's about the size of it , Mrs. Bell . We 've had a rare trip , I can tell you . " Was it very rough ?

I did n't tell you the half of it . We were standing on our heads , most of the time . " " What about those submarines ? " " We were . the submarine , I should say .

" She shook her head . " I was n't expecting you , Bob . Why not walk round to the Three Tuns while I 'm getting the tea ? " " fallow cocked his eye at Watts . " What d' you say ? " Watts nodded . " Suits me. " " 1 lalf an hour , " said Gladys firmly . " Not a minute more , otherwise it 'll spoil . " " What are you going to give us ? " " Never you mind . " " 1'hey collected their caps , and made for the door gradually , like boys preparing to play truant and pretending to do something else . She watched them amusedly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounded as if they 'd earned it . She went through to the kitchen and made ready , happily , to welcome them back as they deserved . Later , in the cosy parlour with a big fire going , they all enjoyed themselves : the two men talked of the trip , and of other trips , while she sat back and listened to them , and threw in an occasional961940 : Skirmishingcomment . She did not like the sound of Compass Rose ; but when she said so , bluntly , they were curiously quick to put in a good word for the ship , to make excuses for this and explain away that . Men , again . . . . But it was good to have them there , and to know that they were relaxed and happy , after the hard times . As soon as they got in at the end of their first trip , Ericson applied for another officer to be appointed to the ship ; it was clear that there was far too much work for a First Lieutenantand two subs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident or illness might make them more short . handed still . He presented a good case , arguing the matter first with a faintly supercilious staff officer who seemed to think that corvettes were some kind of local defence vessel , and then incorporating his arguments in a formal submissionto the Admiralty : it must have been an effective document , since their Lordships acted on it within three weeks . Sub-Lieutenant Morell , they said , was appointed to Compass Rose , " additional for watchkeeping duties " ; Sub-Lieutenant Morell would join them forthwith . Morell arrived , fresh from the training establishment , accompanied by an astonishing amount of luggage : he was a very proper young man , so correct and so assured that it appeared fantastic for him to grace anything as crude as a corvette . In peacetime he was a junior barrister , a product of the other London that was so great a contrast to the Bohemianworld Lockhart knew and worked in : Lockhart , indeed , could only imagine him in black coat and pin-stripe trousers , moving from his chambers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or later , impeccably tailcoated , squiring the least impulsive of the season 's debutantesto Ciro 's or the Embassy . He was grave , slowmoving , and exceedingly courteous : in his brand-new and beautifully cut uniform he seemed far better suited to a diplomatic salon than to Compass Rose 's rough and ready wardroom . He was a living reproof to the solecism of displayingemotion . He was , inevitably , an Old Wykehamist. 97The Cruel SeaHe and Bennett could hardly be expected to mix . On the first evening , at dinner , Morell watched , with an expression of disbelief that Lockhart found ludicrous , as Bennett greeted the tinned sausages with his usual salute , tucked his napkin under his chin , and fell to on this deplorable dish . Morell offered no comment , but it was clear that the scene had made an impression : later , when he and Lockhart were alone in the wardroom , he remarked : " I understand the First Lieutenantcomes from one of the Dominions , " with an absence of expression that was itself the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , himself non-committal . " Ah . . . . I have met one or two Australians  --  usually the victims of confidence tricksters . We can never persuade them that in I , ondon they are likely to encounter people with sharper wits than their own . " " It 's amazing how people still fall for that sort of thing . " " It is not amazing , " said Morell , after reflection . " But it is , at least , continually strange . . . . Do we often have tinned sausages for dinner , by the way ? " " Very often . " " Whether this war is long or short , " said Morell , after reflectingagain , " it is going to seem long . " ' That was the only comment he made that could have been construed as any kind of criticism . But in spite of this discretion , he must have come into early collision with Bennett : next afternoon , when work was over , he sought out Lockhartand asked him , with some formality , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is novel to me , " he began . " I wish you 'd explain what it means . " " What was it ? " asked Lockhart , with an equal gravity . " He said  --  ah  --  ' Do n't come the acid with me . ' " Morell screwed up his eyes . " Come the acid ' . . . I must confess I have not heard that before . " " What were you talking about ? " " We were discussing the best way of dismantling the firing-bar on the asdic set . " he paused . " That 's not too technicalfor you ? " 981940 : Skirmishing " No , " said Lockhart . " But it may have been too technical for Bennett . He 's been trained in a rougher school . " " That may well be the case . . . . So coming the acid ' . . . " " It means that you probably corrected him without wrappingit up enough . " Morell smiled : it was the first time Lockhart had seen him do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You must have overdone it , then . " The other man sighed . " How strange to meet Scylla and Charybdis in Atlantic waters . . . . Perhaps I should explain the allusion . There were  --  " " Do not , " said Lockhart , with a fair approximation of Bennett 's accent , " come the acid with me . " " Ah ! " exclaimed Morell . " Now I understand . " They both laughed . Lockhart was glad that Morell had joined them : he promised to enliven the wardroom , though with little intention of so doing , and the wardroom could do with all the enlivenment possible. 4lThe first few convoys followed the pattern of their initiation . They still worked with Viperous as leader of the group , which had been strengthened by Sorrel joining it : they were still , as a fighting escort , untried by the enemy . There were submarines about  --  other convoys kept running into them  --  but so far their luck had held : the log recorded no shot in anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , continued to put Compass Rose to the test : whatever the season , it seemed that the Atlantic could never wholly abandon its mood of violence . But the longer days of spring and early summer did , in fact , afford them some relief : watchkeeping by day was cer-99The Cruel Seatainly less of a strain , whatever antics the ship was going through . They were now divided into three watches , four hours on duty and eight off : Bennett and Lockhart were both on their own , and Morell and Ferraby shared the third watch together . The eight hours off duty were so great an advantage , bringing them fresh to their watch , that it was almostimpossible to believe that they had once done without them . Certainly the new arrangements suited Ericson , who could now sleep most of the long day and be available , comparativelyrested , at any time during the night . Of his watchkeepingofficers , he found that Bennett was all right as long as nothing unexpected happened : that Lockhart was completelytrustworthy , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any crisis : and that Morell and Ferraby , between them , added up to something like a dependable pair of hands and eyes . He could hardly expect more , from this cheerfully amateur collection . But the nights were still a strain and a challenge to them all , whether the enemy were near or far . Darken Ship was piped at sunset each day : from that moment , no glimmer of light must show either in the convoy or among the escortthefaintest gleam might beckon a submarine that otherwise would have no suspicion ships were in its area . That moment when they drew the covers on was always significant : usuallythere had been some sort of U-boat warning during the day , and if other convoys were running into trouble it must , sooner or later , be their own turn . Thus there would be a feeling throughout the ship , each time dusk fell , that they were approaching uncertainty again , extending the chances of action : from then on , at any moment , there might be a U-boat sniffing the air a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there might be a bang close by them  --  or even in their own guts . The canvas screens were drawn across the entrances , the lights were dimmed inside , the galley fire damped down : Compass Rose , steaming through the cold evening air toward a horizon barely distinguishable from the sky , became a grey shadow clinging to other shadows that she must not lose . In thick weather , when the moon wasdown , to keep their correct station on the convoy as it hurried through the essential darkness was a strain on the attention and the eyesight that left them , at the end of- their four hours , exhausted and blinking with fatigue . But if they lost the convoy , or got grossly out of station , the price was not simply a red face in the morning : it might be a U-hoat piercing the gap they had left , and lives and ships on their conscience . There were other cares at night , complicating a plain effort of seamanship . The current orders were that escorts were to zigzag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being hit themselves ; it was a sensible precaution , and one they all approved of , but a zigzag on a pitch-black night , with thirty ships in close contact adding the risk of collision to the difficulty of hanging on to the convoy , was something more than a few lines in a Fleet Order . Lockhart , who now kept a permanent middle watch  --  midnight to four a.m.  --  and on whom the brunt of the dark hours fell , evolved his own method . He took Compass Rose out obliquely from the convoy , for a set number of minutes : very soon , of course , he could not see the other ships , and might have had the whole Atlantic to himself , but that was part of the manoeuvre . Then he turned , and ran back the same number of minutes on the corresponding course inwards : at the end , he should be in touch with the convoy again , and in the same relative position . It was an act of faith that continued to justify itself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He once had a nightmare , and later evolved a fairy story , in which Compass Rose , steaming towards the convoy again on the inward course , never met it : she went on and on , over a blank dark sea that presently paled with daylight , and there was never a ship in sight . . . . And once the Captain had come up , when they were at the very limit of the outward leg and out of touch with the convoy , and had looked about him as if he could scarcely believe his eyes . " Where are they , Lockhart ? " he asked with a certain grimness . I00 I0IThe Cruel SeaLockhart pointed . " There , sir . . . . We 're on the outer zigzag , " he added , to justify a blank horizon . " We 'll meet them again in seven minutes . " Ericson grunted . It was not a reassuring sound , and Lock- hart , counting the minutes , wondered what on earth he was going to say if this time his nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , black and solid , he had a surge of relief that he felt the Captain was aware of . " Zigzagging on time ? " said Ericson curtly . " Yes , sir . " " Check your course each time you alter . Do n't leave it to the quartermaster  --  he might make a mistake . " Then he walked off the bridge without further comment . That was what Lockhart liked about the Captain : if he trusted you , he showed it  --  he did n't fiddle about in the background , pre- tending to do something else , and all the time watching you like a nursemaid . And he was quite entitled to be worried , and to ask questions when he felt like it : if they did lose the convoy , whichever one of them was responsible , it was , as far as the official record went , the Captain 's fault . What Lockhart found especially annoying was handing over his watch to Bennett . By tradition , the First Lieutenant had the morning watch  --  four a.m. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual time went , but in other respects he scarcely justified his position . It was mortifying to cling on to the convoy all through the middle watch , keep- ing exact station and a fast , accurate zigzag , and hand over Compass Rose in a pinpoint position at the end of it ; and then to hear , as he left the bridge , Bennett saying : " Signalman ! See that ship there ? Tell me if we start to lose her , " and then settling down inside the asdic hut . One of these days , thought Lockhart , they might all forfeit their lives simply because Bennett had a dislike of fresh air . But it was hardly a matter he could complain of , officially . It would have to wait till the Captain took notice of it . At this stage  --  still unwarlike , still a tame apprenticeship  --  they found hardest to bear the monotony of rolling , with , IO21940 : Skirmishingas an occasional variant , the shuddering crunch with which Compass Rose greeted a head sea . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or off . Often they had to cling to the bridge rail for four hours at a stretch , drenched and cold , while the ship disgraced herself with a tireless forty-degree roll ; and then , off watch and supposedly resting , they had to eat their meals with the food continually slopping into their laps , and the wardroom furniture creakingand sliding and occasionally breaking adrift altogether and hurtling across the room . They were always being hurt , in spite of a continual watchfulness : doorways hit them as they were leaving their cabins : they were thrown out of their bunks as soon as sleep relaxed their tense care , and all round them on the floor would be books and papers and boots and clothes , which some especially violent roll had released from control . It was tremendously exhausting , this never being able to rest without something going wrong , something hitting them , something coming adrift and breaking , or making a noisy clatter for hour after hour . There was a damnable rhythm about the movement : they got tired of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they got tired of paying for a moment 's forgetfulness with bruised legs and shoulders , cut lips , wrenched ankles . But they could not escape it : it was an inherent element in going to sea in corvettes . Sometimes , up on the bridge , they would watch Sorrel being chucked about like a cork , and the spray going over as she punched her way through a rough sea , and they would think how tough she looked , and what a pretty picture , handsome and determined , she made . It was a pity that the reality , in Sorrel as in Compass Rose , was so infinitely unpleasant . One of their convoys , about this time , was a classic in this respect . After nine days on the outward trip , they had turned for home , with some hope of making a quick passage and getting back in less than a week . It did not work that way . . . . The gale that sprang up did more than scatter the convoy : it kept every single ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting for the weather to moderate . In those two days , Compass Rose covered eighteen miles  --  sideways , and due south : she spent them in company with a small merchant ship that had engine trouble and asked for someone to stay with her . For all the furry-eight hours , Compass Rose circled very slowly round the derelict , taking three hours to corn- plete each circuit , moving with agonizing slowness against the mountainous seas and rolling , rolling , rolling all the time as if she wanted to tear her mast out . They lost one of their boats , which went clean under a huge wave and never came up again : they lost some oil drums that were stowed aft : they lost their patience many times , but patience had to return , and sweat it out to the reassemblingencl . . . . When the storm finally blew itself away , they spent another twenty-four hours hunting for the convoy and g it . They were at sea for twenty-two days on that trip : at the end , Compass Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had all been through the same tidal wave , emerging in tatters at the end of it . hey found , on all their convoys , that the food soon be-'tcame intolerably coarse and dull . Compass Rose carried enough fresh meat , bread , and vegetables for five days : after that , their diet was the same dreary procession of tinned sausages , tinned stew , hard biscuit , and tea . ( The tinned stew came in an ornate container labelled " Old Mother Jameson 's Farm Douse Dinner . " Said Morell , surveying the dubious mixture on his plate : " I must remember never to go to dinner at Mrs. Jameson 's . " ) It was enough to support life , and that was all one could say about it : since they ate these horrible meals in a wardroom that was sooner or later flooded out or , at the best , ran with sweat throughout the voyage , the pleasures of the table in Compass Rose never threatened to seduce them from their duty . They found , all the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that some moments at sea were enchanting . Now and again , an afternoon watch on the bridge would prove so perfect a way of passing the time that it seemed al- ' - 1 - -  most ludicrous for them to be paid for it . The convoy was in formation , and not menaced by U-boats : the hot spring sunshinepoured down from a flawless sky : the brave ships advancedin line , leaving behind them , like Compass Rose , a broad white sparkling wake that meant a smooth passage and a day nearer home . On the bridge , there was nothing to do but check the change of course as they zigzagged , and keep an eye on Viperous in case she woke early from her afternoon siesta : for the rest , it was warmth , cool clean air , a steady ship under one 's feet , and an occasional sound  --  a gramophone , the swish of a hose , the clang of an emptied buckettoprove that Compass Rose carried nearly ninety men on this prosperous voyage . They found that some nights , especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain . Sometimes , in sheltered water , when the moon was full , they moved with the convoy past hills outlined against the pricking stars : slipping under the very shadow of these cliffs , their keel divided the phosphorescent water into a gleaming wake that curled away till it was caught and held in the track of the moon . It was then that the watches went pleasantly , with the night air playing round the ship like the music of Prospero'sisle : Morell and Ferraby would talk idly of their homes , or Lockhart and Wells , sharing a later watch , would make it go swiftly in reminiscence and conjecture . These magic nights , unmarred by fatigue or any alarm , were very few : when they were granted , their sweetness remained for long afterwards . Once or twice Ericson , coming up to the bridge in the early hours of the morning , would find it , and the whole ship , so peaceful and so softly lapped by darkness that it was hard to recall the purpose of their voyage . Compass Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every attribute save a gentle assurance of refuge . They found , to meet those other nights which were so brutal and so prolonged , that they were toughening up . They became cunning at anticipating what the next big sea would do to the ship , and expert at avoiding its consequences : to hang on as they moved from place to place , to wedge them-I04 iI I05The Cruel Seaselves so that even the relaxation of sleep would not dislodge them , to keep themselves warm , and their clothes waterproof  --  thesewere lessons that the harsh school drove home until they were ingrained . Even the lack of sleep was less damaging now : they developed the facility of snatching odd moments of it whenever possible , and for the rest they could , if need be , stay awake for an astonishing number of hours without losing the , edge of alertness . The process of acceptingthe hard necessities of their life meant that much of their normal feeling was blunted : Lockhart , finding himself one evening discarding the volume of essays he had bought before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current magazines , thought , with faint alarm : Hell , I 'm getting as bad as Bennett . . . . But it was in a sense true , and necessaryas well : the time for sensibility was past , gentleness was outdated , and feeling need not come again till the unfeeling job was over . They found , above all , that one part of every trip could be actively enjoyed : the last day of it , when they were in sheltered water and getting ready for their return to harbour . Now was the time when , running down the Irish Sea and making the last turn for home , they set to work to tidy up the ship after the chaos of the voyage : portholes were opened to the cleansing breeze , wet clothes stripped off and hung out to dry , the furniture and the tables and stools in the messdecksreleased from their lashings and set out properly . The sun gleamed on the saturated decks , and dried them off swiftly , leaving a rime of salt : round the bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recrossing their pathwayas if clearing a way of welcome for them . The convoy , the line of ships they had been guarding for so long , began the last mile of its journey , up-river to the docks : deep-laden , crammed to the decks with cargo , immensely worth while , it struck a note of thankful pride as it was safely delivered . The escort parted , steaming in single file past their charges and further up-river . For them , at last , here was the haven where they would be : peace alongside the oiler , theIo6I94o : Skirmishingmail coming aboard , hot baths , clean clothes , rest and sleep after many days and nights had denied them all these things. 5Suddenly it was time for their first spell of leave : six days , for half the ship 's company and all the officers save one , so that Compass Rose could have her boilers cleaned and a few small repairs carried out . It was their first break since the ship was commissioned , five months previously ; they felt that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this view , privately admitted that they were right , He himself , sitting opposite Grace in a comfortable armchairfor six successive evenings , could not get used to the stillness of the house . Aboard Compass Rose there was always something stirring ; even when she was in harbour , there were engine-room fans and dynamos going all the time , there was the quartermaster clumping round the upper deck , there were signals coming down , and the noise of Morse from the W/T office , and the wardroom radio doing its best to cheer the lonely-hearted sailors , cradled in the deep of Gladstone Dock . Here there was nothing , save the click of Grace 's knitting needles and the rustle of coal in the grate . Her mother had postponed her visit , though she might descend on them in the near future : John , their son , was away at sea  --  Ericson still had not managed to meet him since Compass Rose was commissioned , even though they went in and out of the same port . So , in the silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was nothing out of the ordinary : to Ericson himself , it was an unsettling contrast with what must be his true habit of life . There were other things he could not get used to . It was a woman 's house , soft and rather frilly : the cushions multipliedon the sofa , the ornaments were brittle and inescapably gay , the tablecloth was a lace affair that caught against his hands whenever he moved them . He felt out of place : he feltI07The Cruel Seaas if he were somehow breaking training , at a time when a hard austerity was the essential choice . Sleeping with Grace in the big double bed upstairs had an indulgence , an added warmth , that he did not really want to enjoy . She was his wife , but to lie with her , even in passive sleep , had a sensual element that betrayed his instinct for celibacy . If she was aware of this subtle withdrawal , she gave no sign : for very many years she had taken things at their face value , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question what lay below the surface of any reasonable relationship . " You 're restless , George , " she said , one night when he had tossed and turned till past midnight , and finally woken her from a comfortable dream . " Ca n't you get to sleep ? " " It 's the bed , " he answered irritably . " I ca n't get used to it. , , " I thought sailors could sleep anywhere . " Between waking and sleeping , her common sense had a fugitive quality that occasionally betrayed her into flippancy . Ordinarily , she would never have made so derivative a comment . " This one ca n't . " " Shall I make some tea ? " " No , thank you . " Now that he had woken her , he wanted nothing except that she should go to sleep again and leave him to his isolation . The longer they talked in this intimate setting , the deeper he was involved in a softer world that might destroy his resolute spirit . Even in peacetime , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job for a single , tough man . Now , in war , relaxation seemed a form of treason . . . . The odd , overdramatic thoughts continued to pursue him , as Grace turned over and went to sleep again . He had never felt quite like this before : perhaps he was worrying too much , perhaps he did need a spell of leave after all . But that did n't mean letting everything slip . Tomorrowhe would go down to the ship again . Just to look around , just to see how she was getting on. 1081940 : SkirmishingBennett was talking to a woman in a hotel bedroom . She was the usual woman  --  infinitely tainted , infinitely practised , hard as nails ; it was the usual room . The hotel stood , or rather lay in wait , at the back of the dock area ; it was dedicated to a fornication so incessant and so transitory that there were often more people passing up and down the stairs than using the bedrooms . It was like a dirty hive , serving a machine-made sexuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Bennett had known that the building housed , at that particularmoment , four members of Compass Rose 's crew besideshimself , it would probably have struck him as a form of insubordination . He would not have considered that he himself was in the wrong place . Now he untied his tie before the tarnished mirror , while behind him the bedsprings creaked as the woman composed herself for the encounter . While thus occupied , they made the conversation appropriate to the moment . " Did you have a nice voyage , dear ? " " Lousy , " said Bennett briefly . " Gets worse every time . I reckon I 'm going to quit . " " You ca n't do that , can you ? " " I 'll find a way . They ca n't keep me cooped up in a little crap-boat like that for ever . " " It must be funny on a boat  --  a lot of men all jammed up together . What d' you talk about ? " Bennett , who was taking off his trousers , paused . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Love all the time , I suppose . " " Something like that . " " They say sailors are all the same . " The woman , whom no violence and no crudity incidental to her trade could now surprise , sketched a sentimental sigh . It was a minor triumph of artifice over conviction . " There was a bit in the Mirror about it the other day  --  how they were always on the lookoutfor pen pals . " " First I 've heard of it , " said Bennett . He leered . " They 're always on the look-out for something , but they do n't want to use a pen in it . " I09The Cruet SeaThe woman smiled mechanically . For her , no indecent jokes were new , or funny , but they seemed to entrance the customers . One man had nearly fallen out of bed , telling her about a friend of his who got cramp on the job and had to be carted off to hospital , with the girl beside him on the stretcher . For the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one . . . . " Well , " said Bennett , turning to the bed , " this is what I 've been waiting for . " " My ! " said the woman , almost immediately . " You are passionate , are n't you . Sure you 're not French ? " " There 's only one thing French about me , " said Bennett , and roared with sudden laughter . The woman smiled again . Very comical . . . . " I 'm sure you must- be French , " she insisted . " They say they 're too bloody passionate to live . " " You ca n't hold on to it for ever , " said Bennett explanatorily . " I 've been carrying this lot around for four months . " " It all adds up , does n't it ? " said the woman vaguely . " Careful now . . . . " Morell , who had very much wanted a quiet evening at home , said : " Of course , darling . Where would you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were so many lovely places , and they only had five days to cover them . . . . Of course , she could go anywhere she liked , whether he were here or not , but it was nice to make the most of him while he was here  --  he looked so sweet in his uniform , even though the single thin stripe was a bit depressing . She pulled a face at herself in the dressing-table mirror , adjusted a curl at the nape of her neck , and said : " You decide , darling . It 's your leave , after all . " Morcll , lounging behind her on the quilted bed , wondered if that were quite true . He wondered , indeed , whether anythingreally belonged to him , where his wife was concerned : he found her so incredibly lovely and persuasive that all his will , all his competent judgement , could be swamped on theII0I940 : Skirmishinginstant , and he would surrender the most cherished project at a flick of her fingers . The world saw him as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , and a future in the law ; it did not see , it could not guess , how his marriage had proved a sensual solvent for this whole fabric . She was a minor actress , on the fringe of the West  --  d stage : she was not appearing at the moment  --  the war seemed to have made her so very busy in other ways . . . . When Morell had married her , it was almost as if he were playing a part himself , so incongruous did the combination of himself and this glamorous creature seem : the incongruity had been solved by his ceasing , for all intents and purposes , to be himself at all , when he was with her . He spoke to her as he spoke to no one else , with a tender diffidence that none of his friends would have recognized or credited : he listened to her talking , and answered her , as if the brittle chatter of her lovely mouth had been his Lordship 's address to the jury . He also did exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , he was desperately tired : it would be the third night running they had gone out to dine or to dance , and he wanted peace , he wanted Elaine to himself . But from the beginning she had proclaimed that she wished to show him off everywhere , and so it had been a procession of cocktail parties , restaurants , and night clubs : even on his first evening , they had not returned home to their flat until four in the morning . Of course , she had made it up then , made it up with a cunning intensity that had , after three months without her , swamped and overthrown his senses . It seemed that she had felt that too . " Darling , " she had said , with that murmur in her throat which could stir something inside him , even in a moment of satiety , " darling , you must go away more often , or something  --  that was terrific ! " In the face of so fierce a welcome , how difficult to refuse her anything ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought for secrecy ) , how quickly that fervour might dry up . . . . She was beautiful  --  not in a remote fashion , but with a face that beckoned , a mouth formed only for kissing , IIIThe Cruel Seaand a body so soft , so shapely , and so glowing that its only conceivable purpose was to fuse with the sinewed imprint of a man 's . She had , for Morel , a sensual pull that two years of marriage had never assuaged : her moving limbs induced in him an almost insane urgency , her body seemed to flicker for his delight . Even , as now , to watch her dressing , perfuming her neck and shoulders , adjusting a brassiere to encase her flawless breasts , was intolerably exciting . . . . Whenever she wanted , she could promote this frenzy : whenever she did not want , the frenzy was there in a yet more desperate degree . Of course she demanded too much , of course she betrayed the coo ! nlan he had imagined himself to be . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squared the account , making it natural and essential to please her , and boorish to do otherwise . And , once again , if he did n't please her , if he failed to follow her lead in anything , it became dangerous , it was more than he dared . There were so many other people . . . . One of these other people , indeed , had telephoned , on Morell 's first evening at home . From her bath Elaine had called : " Answer that , darling  --  I 'm wet , " and when he lifted the receiver a man 's voice , against a background of music and other voices , had broken in immediately : " Elaine ? There 's a swell party here , but we need that beautiful body  --  how about coming over ? " Morell said , rather foolishly : " Hallo ? " " Oh , sorry , " said the voice . " Who 's that ? " " Morell . " " Who ? " " Morell . " " Oh  --  yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know you were back . " " I 'll tell my wife you called , " said Morell . " Who is it speaking ? " " Does n't matter  --  forget it . G'bye . " He sounded rather drunk , but not as drunk as all that . That evening , once again , they danced till very late , in anight club so hot , so noisy , and so uninhibited that it might have been part of a zoo . It was very crowded :  --  aine seemed to know a great many people , among them half a dozen Air Force pilots who came up in a solid procession to ask her to dance . At one point , clinging to Morell in the twilight of the dance floor , she had stroked his sleeve and murmured : " Darling , how long before you get promoted ? " and he had ceased to be proud of her head on his shoulder , and filt rather foolish instead . But , as usual , she drove all that away as soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol , she swamped and sucked him of fervour till the fatigue of love became an aching reality , and sleep the only drug to ease it . It was his leave , after all . With Mavis , Ferraby spent a wonderful and tender period . She was now living with her mother , and the circumstances-a cramped , suburban house at Purley , a lack of privacy at meals and in the evenings  --  were not ideal ; but it was so lovely to see her again , so lovely to be somebody , to be consideredand deferred to , after the brusque contempt of Compass Rose , that the drawbacks were forgotten . The freedomfrom constraint , and the fading out of the hatred at close quarters , were tangible blessings ; and in their private times together , the return to tenderness proffered so startling a contrast that , to begin with , he could scarcely believe it . " He must be absolutely beastly ! " said Mavis indignantly , when Ferraby had told her something of Bennett 's manners and methods . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ferraby vaguely . He did not really believe this , nor had he , for very shame , told her the full story ; but he did not want the shadow to stay where it had fallen . " The First Lieutenant 's meant to run the ship , really , and that means the officers as well . " " But he need n't be so horrid about it . " " He 's like that . " " They ought n't to allow it , " she said again . " I 'd like to give him a piece of my mind . " Dear Mavis , so sweet and attractive in slacks and the blueI I 2 I13The Cruel SeaAngora jersey , with her little face screwed up in anger and sadness . . . . He kissed her , and said : " Let 's forget about it . How about going for a walk ? " " If you 're not too tired . " He looked at her , and smiled . " Why should I be too tired ? " She blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a disgrace . . . . You know quite well what I meant . " He felt very masculine as he took her arm . But the mention of Bennett 's name must have started a train of thought that remained with him . That night he dreamed of Compass Rose in a storm , and of Bennett shouting at him and refusing to let him issue the right helm-orders , so that they were in danger of running ashore : he woke up , yelling at the top of his voice and sweating with panic , just as the ship drove through smoking breakers towards a line of rocks . . . . Mavis , putting her arms round him , was appalledat the feel of his wet trembling body and at the idea , which each shudder communicated , of an emotional turmoil greater than he could bear : when he apologized for the noise he had made , it was as if he were excusing some hopeless deformity for which he deserved all the pity in her heart . " I must have been dreaming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling . " " What was the dream about , Gordon ? " ' The ship . " " Tell me . " " I 've forgotten . " But after a moment he did start to tell her , while she held him close and listened with misgiving and with a new understanding compassion flooding through her : for in the end he told her everything  --  his fears and failures , the guilty doubt of his fitness for the job , the true story of the last few months . It was easier in the dark , with her head on his shoulder , and , as usual with her , there was no shame in confession ; indeed , it was she who was the more moved when he had finished , who suffered his own fear of returning after the leave was finished , and felt it as her own miserable dilemma . Above all , she was shaken by the revela-I14194o : Skirmishingtion , which nothing in his cheerful letters to her had even hinted at . This was not the man she knew and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked far into the night . There was little she could give him save the assurance of her own confidence : it sounded pathetically inadequate against the wretched background he had sketched for her . She remembered for long afterward a single stubborn sentence of his , which he repeated whenever she suggested that he might ask for a different jot ) : " I ca n't give up something I volunteered for . " She could not persuade him either that the job was proving infinitely harder than he had imagined , and might thus be honourably abandoned , or that Bennett was so horrible a complication that the whole basis of his engagement was changed . Somewhere deep inside him , an obstinate self-destroying will was at work , forbidding him to surrender . For some reason , after that night , she hoped that she would have a child as soon as possible . Lockhart , having lost the toss , stayed aboard as duty officer . It would be his turn for leave next time , and in any case he found that he did not mind being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the extra gold ring on his sleeve burned bright with new responsibility . . . . It was , also , the sort of rest he needed , and in his spare time he occupied himself much as he would have done on leave  --  reading , listening to the radio , unwinding the tight coil of the past few months . Compass Rose , with her boilers blown down and no fans working , was cool and silent : it was odd to feel the ship , hitherto so active and alive , sinking back into a suspended laziness that matched his own . There was very little to do , and nothing that demanded any sort of concentration on his part : he saw the hands fall in after breakfast , and told Leading Seaman Phillips what had to be done in the way of sweeping and painting : he opened the mail , in case there were anything urgent : he dispatched the libertymenashore , clean and tidy , at four o'clock ; and he went round the ship at nine in the evening , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were something of a picnic : both the leading cook and Carslake , the leading steward , were on leave , and his welfare was in the hands of the second steward , Tomlinson , who had once had a coffee-stall in the Edgware Road and whose methods were better suited to a quick turnoverin saveloys and hot pies , cash only and no back answers , than to the gentler world of the wardroom . But since , being alone , Lockhart had revived his peacetime habit of reading all the time he was eating , the slapdash service and the indifferentfood did not greatly worry him . They were tied up alongside Viperous , which was also boiler-cleaning : it was the first time he had been able to examinea destroyer in close detail , and he took advantage of their neighbouring position to go aboard several times . His opposite number , also left on board for the leave period , was a young R.N. sub-lieutenant who , though aware of his inferiorityof rank , could hardly take an R.N.V.R. lieutenant seriously : Lockhart was amused to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural contempt for an amateur . There was nothing amateur about Viperous , certainly : the rigid R.N. atmosphere , allied to the almost professional glamour of a destroyer , was a potent combination . Viperous and Compass Rose might be doing the same job , and they might share the same hardships ; but there was no doubt which of them was the elder brother , with an elder brother 's unchallenged status . Their relative positions in the hierarchy , however , now seemed to matter less than they had done at the beginning . Lockhart was coming to believe in corvettes , as were many other people : they were the smallest ships regularly employed on Atlantic convoys  --  the trawlers and tugs had been withdrawn as unsuitable  --  and sea-going in corvettes was already appropriating a toughness and a glamour of its own . He had one or two visitors during the leave period . Among them was Lieutenant-Commander Ramsay , the captain of Sorrel , who came aboard one morning and put his head round the wardroom door . " Anyone in ? " he asked loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stocky , with a rolling West Country accent : reputed to be a disciplinary terror in his own ship , he appeared to shed it as soon as he crossed the gangway . " Hallo , sir ! " Lockhart put aside his newspaper . " Conic in . " Is your captain on board ? " " No , he 's on leave still . Will you have a drink ? " " Aye . Gin , please . . . I see you got that second stripe . How 's that First Lieutenant of yours ? " Lockhart grinned . " Bearing up . " " Makes you hop about a bit , does n't he ? " " He  --  er  --  maintains a stiff discipline , yes . " Ramsay smiled in his turn . " One way of putting it . . . Here 's luck . " They gossiped for some little time , mostly about their own escort group and the job that corvettes were doing : they both betrayed the half-humourous resignation that seemed inevitable when those who sailed in corvettes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sorrel that had occurred on the last convoy  --  a huge wave had broken right over her bridge , smashed two windows in the charthouse , and bent the rail nearly a foot out of the true . Compass Rose could not quite match that experience , Lockhartdecided after rummaging in his memory , though there was a morbid interest in trying to do so on her behalf . . . . Ramsay , when he rose to leave , said , out of the blue : " Maybe you 'll get a First Lieutenant 's job yourself , one of these days . " The remark made Lockhart both pleased and thoughtful for some time afterwards . It was an idea that had never even occurred to him ; now that he examined it , it did not seem so fantastic as it might have at the beginning of the year . His principal other visitor was Ericson himself , who slipped aboard one day toward the end of their leave , and walked round the ship with an air so suspicious and so proprietary that Lockhart found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or failed to do at all . But the Captain seemed to be satisfied that Compass Rose wasI17The Cruel Sea 1 1940 : SkirmishingNo one answered him . The full glass slopped over his coat as he gestured drunkenly . " Matey lot of bastards , are n't you ? " He eyed 1 , ockhartwith confused belligerence . " What 's been happening while I 've been away ? " " Nothing at all . " " I suppose you were slipping ashore the whole time . " I Ic took an enormous gulp of whisky , coughed , and only just held on to it . His eyes moved unsteadily round to Morell and Ferraby . " And as for you married men  --  married  --  " he lost the thread of what he was going to say , but unfortunately started again . " You had a wonderful time . Do n't tell me . " " It was very pleasant , " said Morell after a pause . " I bet you left a bun in the oven , both of you , " said Bennettthickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the room . They heard him stumbling up the ladder , and the clang of the lavatory door behind him . " Now what on earth does that peculiar phrase mean ? " asked Morell , when he had gone . Lockhart , considerably embarrassed , said : " I should n't worry about it if I were you . " " But what ? " Morell insisted . Lockhart explained , as delicately as he could , the reference to pregnancy . It could not be made to sound in the least delicate , and the reaction was what he had expected . Ferrabyflushed vividly and looked at the floor : Morell lost his normal air of indifference and for a moment his face had a startling expression of disgust and anger . " What a monstrous man he is ! " he said in the uncomfortablepause that followed . " How can we get rid of him ? " " I 've an idea he might get rid of himself , " answered Lockhart , glad of the change of subject . " He did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised if he gave this job up . " " How could he do that ? " asked Ferraby , in a voice so subdued and spiritless that it was almost a whisper . Lockhart gestured vaguely . " Oh , there are ways . . . . If I were he , I think I should get a duodenal ulcer . For some reason the Navy takes them very seriously  --  if they suspectcoming to no harm : he stayed to have lunch on board and , as if to mark the difference between this occasion and the normal times when the ship was working , he dropped all formality and proved himself very good company on a new and level plane . He was especially interesting when he talked about his own apprenticeship in the Navy , and the quick learning that the war had now made necessary , compared with the wearisome year-to-year grind of peacetime seagoingand the desperately slow promotion that rewarded it . Lockhart had the impression that Ericson was now becoming convinced of something perhaps the capability of amateurs like himself which before he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was one of the most pleasant meals he had ever had in Compass Rose : it left him with a feeling of respect , almost of- hero-worship , for Ericson , which a little earlier he would have dismissed as a surrender of individuality . Some of his peacetime convictions , it seemed , were being rubbed off : if the ones that took their place were as natural and as unforced as this new regard , it did not matter at all. 16On the evening of their return from leave , Lockhart , Morell , and Ferraby were all in the wardroom when Bennettstumbled down the ladder and entered the room . He was undeniably drunk , and most of his trouser buttons were undone : the general effect was so unpleasant that it was difficult to include him in their company without exhibiting a strong reaction . For some moments he busied himself at the sideboard , while they watched him in silence ; then he turned round , glass in hand , and focused his eyes on each of them in turn . " Well , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good little boys , all back from leave at the proper time . . . . How did you tear yourself away ? " I18 I19The Cruel Seaanything like that they put you ashore straight away , in case something blows up while you 're at sea . " " One of us had better tell him , " said Morell after reflection . " I would n't like him to be in any doubt as to how to go about it , just for want of a word of advice . " " I should say he knows , " remarked Lockhart . " How wonderful if he did go , " said Ferraby , in the same small voice . " It would stake such a terrific difference . " " Funnier things have happened . " " But not nicer , " said Morell . " Not in my experience , at least . " By one of those coincidences that occasionally sweeten the crudest circumstances , Lockhart 's forecast came exactly true . The very next day , at lunch , Bennett , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his stomach and gave a realistic groan . " Jesus ( ' hrist ! " he said , in a voice suppressed by tension and mashed potato . " That hurt ! " " What 's the matter ? " said Ericson , looking at him with non-committal interest . " I ieii of a pain . . . . " Kennett gave another groan , yet more heart-rending , and doubled up across the table . His hands were still clasped to his stomach , and his breath came heavily through clenched teeth . It was difficult , for a variety of reasons , not to applaud the occasion . " Better lie down , " said Ericson . " Take it easy for a bit . " " Jesus , it 's agony ! " " Perhaps you have a bun in the oven , " said Morell suavely . He raised his eyebrows as he saw Lockhart strugglingwith laughter . Bennett levered himself upright , and tottered towards the door . " Reckon I 'll lie down , " he mumbled . " It may pass off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moaningwith great clarity . " Bad luck , " observed the Captain . " Most moving , " said Morell . " I imagine there 's nothingI201940 : Skirmishingwe can do to help him . " The remark was so clearly a statement of non-intention that Lockhart could hardly stop laughing out loud . Ericson looked round the table suddenly . " What arc you all grinning at ? " he demanded . " Sorry , sir , " said Lockhart , who was the most uncontrolledoffender . " I was thinking of something . " Morell frowned , with a wonderful air of disapproval . " It hardly does you credit , at a time like this , " he said stiffly . " If the First Lieutenant is in pain , I should not have thought you would be able to laugh at anything else . " Ericson looked from one to the other , started to speak , and then let it go . They were behaving rather badly : but he himself was conscious of a certain lightening of the atmosphere , now that Bennett had taken himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same feeling in other people . . . . The only drawback to the slightly farcical occasion was the possibility of Bennett 's really being ill : for Compass Rose was at twelve hours ' notice for steam , and likely to sail the next day . His foreboding was accurate enough . Bennett complained of pain all that afternoon : he went off to the naval hospital the same evening , and he did not return . When Ericson summonedLockhart to his cabin next morning , he had on his desk two signals that did not go well together . One was their sailing orders , for four o'clock : the other was about Bennett . " The First Lieutenant wo n't be back for some time , Lockhart , " Ericson began . " He 's got a suspected duodenal ulcer . " " Oh , " said Lockhart . He felt inclined to laugh , at the way it had all fallen into place so neatly , and then he had a sudden thought which brought him up sharply . Something else was falling into place , something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited for the Captain to speak , knowing what he was going to say , almost fearing to hear it in case it should be less than he hoped . Ericson was frowning at the two signals . " We sail this afternoon , and we 'll have to go without him . There 's no I 2 IThe Cruel Sea 1940 : Skirmishingchance of getting a relief by then , either . " He looked up . " You 'll have to take over as Number One , and organize the watches on that basis . " " Yes , sir , " said Lockhart . I lis heart , to his secret surprise , had raced for a moment , as if to mark a violent pleasure . First Lieutenant . . . . It could be done , and it would have to be  --  he would n't have another chance like this one , for a very long time . " I 'll help you with it , " Ericson went on . " You should be able to carry on until a relief arrives . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Ericson looked at him again . Lockhart had spoken with a kind of informal resolution that was a new thing in their relationship . " Yes , sir . " " All right , " said Ericson after a pause . " I 'll see . . . . Do your best this time , anyway . " Lockhart walked out of the cabin with that precise determination . The first convoy , with the new job to do , was a challenge , and I , ockhart took it on happily . As far as watchkeeping was concerned , it gave him an easier run : he now had the morningwatch , from four a.m. until eight , and in this early part of the summer that meant almost four hours of daylight watchkeeping , instead of the strain and difficulty of a totally dark middle watch . But there were many other things that went with his promotion , added responsibilities that must always be borne in mind : from the first afternoon , when after a final check-up with Tallow he reported Compass Rose " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the routine interruptions that the proper execution of his job entailed , and never free of worry lest he had forgotten something . He did not mind , because he was professionally and personally interested , as well as immensely eager to make a success of it ; but on that convoy , as on many others still to come , he worked harder than he ever had before . In essence , he had to present the Captain with a going con-I22cern , a smoothly run ship that would not fail him in any trial . In harbour it involved one range of responsibility , concerned mostly with discipline , topping up stores and ammunition , and the organization of working-parties so as to keep the ship clean and efficient : at sea it took on a more vital quality , closer to the war and with less margin for error . Weapons had to be tested daily ; parties detailed to deal with the odd things that went wrong : watches had to be changed or strengthened ; the mess-decks visited twice a day to see that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board became even more grossly uncomfortable than it need be : at nightfall , Compass Rose must fade into the twilight with no light showing , no weapon out of order , and no man on board in any doubt of what he must do , whatever the circumstances . It was a full program ; but he was strengthened by Ericson 's backing , which was strong and continuous , and pleased also by the reaction of Morell and Ferraby . They gave him a cheerful co-operation : freed from Bennett 's heavy-handed regime , and wanting above all to make a success of the substitution , they went out of their way to help him through the first uncertain period . For they were free of Bennett : he faded away into a dilatorybackground of hospital boards and recurrent examinations , and they never saw him again . Lockhart 's promotion was confirmed , not without some misgivings , by Western Approaches Command ; and the new officer who arrived to fill the gap , one Sub-Lieutenant Baker , was junior to Ferrabyand , if his hesitant air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new team assembled and settled down , makingof Compass Rose a different ship altogether . The wardroomwas now a pleasant place where they could relax and feel at ease , without a morose and critical eye singling them out for comment : after six months of suspicion and the most oafish kind of tyranny , it made for a happy freedom that they did not want to abuse . The same feeling spread throughout the ship , filtering down to the lower deck , where Bennett'scrude methods had aroused the most resentment and the strongest reaction in terms of idling and shirking : the123The Cruel Seaidea that Lockhart , though no fool , was a better man to work for , produced , as it often does , more work and not less . There were of course , to start with , one or two efforts at taking advantage of the more reasonable rule , notably by libertymen who returned on hoard late and produced elaborate excuses for doing so ; but after one conspicuous offender , claiming to have been involved in a boarding-house fire , had been informedby Lockhart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the night in question had been the first one for four months on which the Liverpool Fire Brigade had not been called out , and had then been sent to detention by the Captain , the number of men ready to " try it on " showed a steep decline . Ericson , observing the general improvement , was pleased with his experiment . He had gone to a good deal of trouble to get Lockhart 's appointment confirmed , in the face of a stubbornsort of disbelief ashore , and the trouble was worth while . Both he and Compass Rose had gained something that might be even more valuable in the near future . There was one job of Lockhart 's that had been his ever since he had joined Compass Rose and had admitted , in a moment of inattention , that one of his great-uncles had once been a surgeon at Guy 's Hospital ; and that was the job of ship 's doctor . So far it had involved him in nothing more than treatingtoothache , removing a splinter from a man 's eye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a stubborn case of lice-infestation : all the serious cases went to the naval hospital ashore , and as yet nothing in this class had ever occurred at sea . Vaguely he realized that this would not always be so : other corvettes had had casualties to deal with , after ships in convoy had been torpedoed , and sooner or later he himself would be faced with an experience he was little fitted for . It was a thought he shied away from , because he had a real doubt as to how he would meet the ordeal : nothing in his life , not even a casual motor accident , had brought him into contact with blood and violence , and he feared a reaction that might be ineffective or foolish . " Fainting at the sight of1241940 : Skirmishingblood "  --  the stock phrase sometimes occurred to him , with a discomforting twinge of anxiety . Suppose that was what happened , suppose he could not help it . . . . The job of doctor was the only one on board that , in moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far it had been a sinecure : so far , their most challengingmedical problem had been sufficiently beyond his scope for him to be justified in rejecting it . The occasion had been the start of a convoy , when the line of ships was forming up after the slow progress down-river . A near-by tanker had started signalling to Compass Rose , and Wells , receiving the message , passed it on to the Captain . " From the tanker , sir , " he said . " Have you a doctor on board or can you give medical advice ? ' " Ericson looked at Lockhart , who was also up on the bridge . " How about it , Number One ? " " I 'll have a crack at it , sir , " said Lockhart . " I ca n't do much harm at this distance . " " All right . " He turned to Wells . " Make to them : Medical advice available . What are symptoms ? ' " There was a pause , while the lamps flickered again . Then Wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " in a startled voice . It was the first time Lockhart had ever seen him surprised , and he wondered what could be coming . With no sort of expression , Wells gave the " message received " signal , and then said : " Reply , sir : Tight foreskin . ' " There was a reflective silence on the bridge . " Sir , " said Lockhart , " I honestly do n't know . " " Does you credit , " answered Ericson . It was one of those remarks he occasionally made , which endeared him to Lockhartas something more than a good captain . " I do n't think we have any experts on board , have we ? " " No , sir , " said Lockhart . " Afraid we can not help your patient , ' " Ericson dictated to Wells , " Will ask destroyer , which has a doctor . ' Send that off . . . . Fine start for a twenty-one day convoy , " heI25The Cruel Seasaid thoughtfully . " That 'll teach him not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of signals with Viperous was of a kind that does not figure in the official log : at the end of it , Lockhart had less inclination to continue his medical career than ever before . Later , in mid-Atlantic , they inquired after the casualty , and received the answer : " Patient enjoyed a good night . " " We know that , " was Morell 's dry comment . " It was the original trouble . " And then , suddenly , being the doctor was n't funny any more . Dunkirk , that fabulous flight and triumph , was their signal for joining battle : from then onward , almost every convoy they escorted suffered some sort of attack , either from U-boats or aircraft , and the loss of ships began to be an inevitablepart of their sea-going . Dunkirk , as it was bound to , made a great difference to the balance of things in the Atlantic : the operation itself drew off many ships , destroyers and corvettes alike , from regular convoy-escort , and some of them were lost , others damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was over , to be on hand in case of invasion . The shortage of escorts at this stage was ludicrous : even with the arrival of fifty obsolescent destroyersthat America had now made available to the Allies , convoyssailed out into the Atlantic with only a thin token screen between them and the growing force of U-boats . When , after Dunkirk , the Royal Navy turned its attention to the major battle again , it was to find control of the battlefield threatened by a ruthless assault , which quickened and grew with every month that passed . There was another factor in the altered account . The map now showed them a melancholy and menacing picture : with Norway gone , France gone , Ireland a dubious quantity on their doorstep , and Spain an equivocal neutral , nearly the whole European coastline , from Narvik to Bordeaux , was available to U-boats and , more important still , as air bases for long-range aircraft . Aircraft could now trail a convoy farI26I940 : Skirmishingout into the Atlantic , calling up U-boats to the attack as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit disastrous to the Allies . In the three months that followed Dunkirk , over two hundred ships were sent to the bottom by these two weapons in combinations , and the losses continued at something like fifty ships a month till the end of the year . Help was on the way  --  new weapons , more escorts , more aircraft : but help did not come in time , for many ships and men , and for many convoys that made port with great gaps in their ranks . It was on one of these bad convoys , homeward bound near Iceland , that Compass Rose was blooded . When the alarm bell went , just before midnight , Ferraby left the bridge where he had been keeping the first watch with Baker , and made his way aft towards his depth charges . It was he who had rung the bell , as soon as the noise of aircraftand a burst of tracer bullets from the far side of the convoyindicated an attack ; but though he had been prepared for the violent clanging and the drumming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of sick surprise at the urgency that now possessed the ship , in its first alarm for action . The night was calm , with a bright three-quarter moon that bathed the upper deck in a cold glow , and showed them the nearest ships of the convoy in hard revealing outline ; it was a perfect night for what he knew was coming , and to hurry down the length of Compass Rose was like going swiftly to the scaffold . He knew that if he spoke now there would be a tremble in his voice , he knew that full daylight would have shown his face pale and his lips shaking ; he knew that he was not really ready for this moment , in spite of the months of training and the gradually sharpening tension . But the moment was here , and somehow it had to be faced . Wainwright , the young torpedoman , was already on the quarterdeck , clearing away the release-gear on the depth charges , and as soon as Wainwright spoke  --  even though it was only the three words " Closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was consumed by nervousness . . . . He foundI27The Cruel Sea the fact heartening , in a way he had not expected : if his own fear of action were the common lot , and not just a personal and shameful weakness , it might he easier to cure in corn- pany . He took a grip of his voice , said : " Get the first pat- tern ready to drop , " and then , as he turned to check up on the depth-charge crews , his eye was caught by a brilliant fire- work display on their beam . The attacking aircraft was now flying low over the centre of the convoy , pursued and harried by gunfire from scores of ships at once . The plane could not be seen , but her swift progress could be followed by the glowing arcs of tracer bullets , which swept like a huge fan across the top of the con- voy . The uproar was prodigious  --  the plane screaming through the darkness , hundreds of guns going at once , one or two ships sounding the alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with everyone blazing away at the low-flying plane and not worrying about what else was in the line of fire , must have been an inferno . Standing in their groups aft , close to the hurrying water , they watched and waited , wondering which way the plane would turn at the end of her run : on the platform above them the two-pounder gun 's crew , motionless and helmeted against the night sky , were keyed ready for their chance to fire . But the chance never came , the waiting belts of ammunition remained idle : some- thing else forestalled them . It was as if the monstrous noise from the convoy must have a climax , and the climax could only be violent . At the top of the centre column , near the end of her run , the aircraft dropped two bombs : one of them fell wide , raising a huge pluming spout of water that glittered in the moonlight , and the other found its mark . It dropped with an iron clang on some ship they could not see  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for after the first explosion there was a second one , a huge orange flash that lit the whole convoy and the whole sky at one ghastly stroke . The ship  --  what- ever size she was  --  must have disintegrated on the instant ; they were left with the evidence  --  the sickening succession of splashes as the torn pieces of the ship fell back into the sea , 128 I29covering and fouling a mile-wide circle , and the noise of the aircraft disappearing into the darkness , a receding tail of sound to underline this fearful destruction . " Must have been ammunition , " said someone in the darkness , breaking the awed and compassionate silence . " Poor bastards . " " Did n't know much about it . Best way to die . " " You fool , " thought Ferraby , trembling uncontrollably , " you fool , you fool , no one wants to die . . . . " From the higher vantage-point of the bridge , Ericson had watched everything ; he had seen the ship hit , the shower of sparks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward , the huge explosion that blew her to pieces . In the shocked silence that followed , his voice giving a routine helm-order was cool and normal : no one could have guessed the sadness and the anger that filled him , to see a whole crew of men like himself wiped out at one stroke . There was nothing to be done : the aircraft was gone , with this frightful credit , and if there were any men left alive  --  which was hardly conceivable  --  Sorrel , the stern escort , would do her best for them . It was so quick , it was so brutal . . . . He might have thought more about it , he might have mourned a little longer , if a second stroke had not followed swiftly ; but even as he raised his binoculars to look at the convoy again , the ship they were stationed on , a hundred yards away , rocked to a sudden explosion and then , on the instant , heeled over at a desperate angle . This time , a torpedo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he jumped to the voice-pipe to increase their speed and start zigzagging , he thought : " If that one came from this side of the convoy , it must have missed us by a few feet . " Inside the asdic hut , Lockhart heard it , and started hunting on the danger-side , without further orders : that was a routine , and even at this moment of surprise and crisis , the routine still ruled them all . Morell , on the fo'c's'le , heard it , and closed up his gun 's crew again and loaded with star-shell : down in the wheelhouse , Tallow heard it , and gripped the wheel tighter , and called out to his quartermasters : " Watch thatThe Cruel Sea ' I 940 : Skirmishingtelegraph , now ! " and waited for the swift orders that might follow . Right aft , by the depth charges , Ferraby heard it , and shivered : he glanced downward at the black water rushingpast them , and then at the stricken ship , which he could see quite clearly , and he longed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his fear . llcep down in the engine room , Chief F.R.A. Watts heard it best of all : it came like a hammer-blow , hitting the ship 's side a great splitting crack , and when , a few seconds afterwards , the telegraph rang for an increase of speed , his hand was on the steam valve already . He knew what had happened , he knew what might happen next . But it was better not to think of what was going on outside : down here , encased below the waterline , they must wait , and hope , and keep their nerve . Ericson took Compass Rose in a wide half-circle to starboard , away from the convoy , hunting for the U-boat down what he presumed had been the track of the torpedo ; but they found nothing that looked like a contact , and presently he circled back again , toward the ship that had been hit . She had fallen out of line , like one winged bird in a flight of duck , letting the rest of the convoy go by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were out of water and she was poised for the long plunge . The cries of men in fear came from her , and a thick smell of oil : at one moment , when they had her outlined against the moon , they could see a mass of men packed high in the towering stern , waving and shouting as they felt the ship under them begin to slide down to her grave . Ericson , trying for a cool decision in this moment of pity , was faced with a dilemma : if he stopped to pick up survivors , he would become a sitting target himself , and he would also lose all chance of hunting for the U-boat : if he went on with the hunt , he would , with Sorrel busy elsewhere , be leaving these men to their death . He decided on a compromise , a not too dangerous compromise : they would drop a boat , and leave it to collect what survivors it could while Compass Rose took another cast away to starboard . But it must be done quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort he knew into controlling his voice . " Ferraby , sir . " " We 're going to drop a boat , sub . Who 's your leading hand ? " " Leading Seaman Tonbridge , sir . " " Tell him to pick a small crew  --  not more than four- and row over toward the ship . Tell him to keep well clear until she goes down . They may be able to get some boats away themselves , but if not , he 'll have to do the best he can . We 'll come back for him when we 've had another look for the submarine . " " Right , sir . " " Quick as you can , sub . I do n't want to stop too long . " Ferraby threw himself into the job with an energy that was a drug for all other feeling : the boat was lowered so swiftly that when Compass Rose drew away from it and left it to its critical errand the torpedoed ship was still afloat . But she was only just afloat , balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Tonbridge took the tiller and glanced in her direction to get his bearings , there was a rending sound that carried clearly over the water , and she started to go down . Tonbridge watched , in awe and fear : he had never seen anything like this , and never had a job of this sort before , and it was an effort to meet it properly . It had been bad enough to be lowered into the darkness from Compass Rose , and to watch her fade away and be left alone in a small boat under the stars , with the convoy also fading and a vast unfriendlysea all round them ; but now , with the torpedoed ship disappearing before their eyes , and the men shouting and crying as they splashed about in the water , and the smell of oil coming across to them thick and choking , it was more like a nightmare than anything else . Tonbridge was twentythreeyears of age , a product of the London slums conditionedby seven years ' naval training ; faced by this ordeal , the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he remainedeffective , was beyond all normal credit . The Cruel SeaThey did what they could : rowing about in the darkness , guided by the shouting , appalled by the choking cries of men who drowned before they could be reached , they tried their utmost to rescue and to succour . They collected fourteen men : one was dead , one was dying , eight were wounded , and the rest were shocked and prostrated to a pitiful degree . It was very nearly fifteen men : Tonbridge actually had hold of the fifteenth , who was gasping in the last stages of terror and exhaustion , but the film of oil on his naked body made him impossible to grasp , and he slipped away and sank before a rope could be got round him . When there were no more shadows on the water , and no more cries to follow , they rested on their oars , and waited ; alone on the enormous black waste of the Atlantic , alone with the settling wreckage and the reek of oil ; and so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the waist of the ship as the boat was hooked on , wondered what he would see when the survivors came over the side : he was not prepared for the pity and horror of their appearance . First came the ones who could climb aboard themselves  --  half a dozen shivering , blackfacedmen , dressed in the filthy oilsoaked clothes they had snatched up when the ship was struck : one of them with his scalp streaming with blood , another nursing an arm flayed from wrist to shoulder by scalding steam . They looked about them in wonder , dazed by the swiftness of disaster , by their rescue , by the solid deck beneath their feet . Then , while they were led to the warmth of the mess-deck , a sling was rigged for the seriously wounded , and they were lifted over the side on stretchers : some silent , some moaning , some coughing up the fuel oil that was burning and poisoning their intestines : laid side by side in the waist , they made a carpet of pain and distress so naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , with the boat still bumping alongside in the eerie darkness , came Tonbridge 's voice : " Go easy  --  there 's a dead man down here . " Ferraby had never seen a dead man before , and he had to force himself to look at this pitiful relic of the sea  --  stone cold , stiffening already , its grey head jerking as it was bundled over the side : an old sailor , un-132194.0 : Skirmishingseamanlike and disgusting in death . He wanted to run away , he wanted to be sick : he watched with shocked amazement the two ratings who were carrying the corpse : " 1 low can you bear what you are doing ? " he thought , " how can you touch  --  it ? . . . " Behind him he heard Lockhart 's voice saying : " Bring the whole lot into the fo'c's'le  --  I ca n't see anything here , " and then he turned away and busied himself with the hoisting of the boat , not looking behind him as the procession of wrecked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inboard , and secure , he turned back again , glad to have escaped some part of the horror . There was nothing left now but the acrid smell of oil , and the patches of blood and water on the deck : nothing , he saw with a gasp of fear and revulsion , but the dead man lying lashed against the rail , a yard from him , rolling as the ship rolled , waiting for daylight and burial . He turned and ran towards the stern , pursued by terror . In the big seamen's-mess-deck , under the shaded lamps , Lockhart was doing things he had never imagined possible . Now and again he recalled , with a spark of pleasure , his previous doubts : there was plenty of blood here to faint at , but that was n't the way things were working out . . . . He had stitched up a gash in a man 's head , from the nose to the line of the hair  --  as he took the catgut from its envelope he had thought : " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had set a broken leg , using part of a bench as a splint . He bound up other cuts and gashes , he did what he could for the man with the burnt arm , who was now insensiblewith pain : he watched , doing nothing with a curious hurt detachment , as a man who had drenched his intestines and perhaps his lungs with fuel oil slowly died . Some of Compass Rose 's crew made a ring round him , looking at him , helping him when he asked for help : the two stewards brought tea for the cold and shocked survivors , other men offered dry clothing , and Tallow , after an hour or two , came down and gave him the largest tot of rum he had ever seen . It was not too large . . . . Once , from outside , there was the sound of an explosion , and he looked up : by chance , 133The Cruel Sea 1940 : Skirmishingacross the smoky fo'c's'le , the bandaged rows of wounded , the other men still shivering , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he met the eye of Leading Seaman Phillips . Involuntarily , both of them smiled , to mark a thought that could only 1 ) c smiled at : if a torpedo hit them now , there would be little chance for any of them , and all this bandaging would be wasted . Then he bent down again , and went on probing a wound for the splinter of steel that must still be there , if the scream of pain the movement produced was anything to go by . This was a moment to think only of the essentials , and they were all here with him , and in his care . It was nearly daylight before he finished ; and he went up to the bridge to report what he had done at a slow dragging walk , completely played out . He met Ericson at the top of the ladder : they had both been working throughout the night , and the two exhausted men looked at each other in silence , unable to put any expression into their stiff drawn faces , yet somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockhart 's hands , and on the sleeves of his duffle coat : in the cold light it had a curious metallic sheen , and Ericson looked at it for some time before he realized what it was . " You must have been busy , Number One , " he said quietly . " What 's the score down there ? " " Two dead , sir , " answered Lockhart . His voice was very hoarse , and he cleared his throat . " One more to go , I think  --  he 's been swimming and walking about with a badly burned arm , and the shock is too much . Eleven others . They ought to be all right . " " Fourteen . . . . The crew was thirty-six altogether . " Lockhart shrugged . There was no answer to that one , and if there had been he could not have found it , in his present mood : the past few hours , spent watching and touching pain , seemed to have deadened all normal feeling . He looked round et the ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How about things up here ? " he asked 134 " We lost another ship , over the other side of the convoy . That made three . " " More than one submarine ? " " I should n't think so . She probably crossed over . " " Good night 's work . " Lockhart still could not expressmore than a formal regret . " Do you want to turn in , sir ? Ican finish this watch . " " No  --  you get some sleep . I 'll wait for Ferraby and Baker . " " Tonbridge did well . " " Yes . . . . So did you , Number One . " Lockhart shook his head . " It was pretty rough , most of it . I must get a little book on wounds . It 's going to come in handy , if this sort of thing goes on . " " There 's no reason why it should n't , " said Ericson . " No reason at all , that I can see . Three ships in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , " said Lockhart , nodding . " A very promising start , After the war , we must ask them how they do it . " " After the war , " said Ericson levelly , " I hope they 'll be asking us. " 8They sailed on eleven convoys that year : sometimes to Iceland , sometimes to Gibraltar , sometimes to the pinpoint in mid-Atlantic that was their rendezvous with the incoming ships . As winter drew on , the weather took a natural turn for the worse : but once the appalling discomfort and the tiredness were accepted , they grew to welcome the rising wind and the falling glass , for the respite of another kind that these brought . For at least they provided cover for the convoy : a black night , with a stiff sea running , was a form of insuranceagainst attack , which they were ready to pay for as135The Cruel Sealong as was necessary . At that time , U-boats had not reached the stage of development when they could fire torpedoes at almost any level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the ships hard to find and harder to hit . At the beginning , they never thought that they would welcome an Atlantic gale : as time went on , no other sort of weather suited them so well . But the wind did not always blow , the moon was not alwaysobscured by cloud . There were many repetitions of that first losing convoy : the tally of survivors gradually mounted , the total of ships lost pursued a steady upward curve . Something , it was clear , would have to be done about this question of survivors , if it was to be worth while fishing them out of the water ; for corvettes , which were detailed for the bull : of this rescue work , were really ludicrously inadequatefor the job . They needed a doctor , or at least a qualified sick-berth attendant , to see to the wounded and exhausted men : it was futile , it was senseless , to risk the ship in picking them up , only to have them die on board , from shock or burns or oil-poisoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for this work , too : spare clothes , spare blankets , a proper sick-bay , drugs to ease pain . They even needed more canvas , for sewing up the dead . A lot of such things , which had not been foreseen , were now emerging into grisly reality . It was on this note of inadequacy , this scrambling waste of effort and courage , that 1940 drew to its close . Another , more memorable , note was struck , too , just before the end . On Christmas morning they saw a ship , loaded with iron ore , break in half and sink in less than one minute : she went down like a stone in a pond , leaving nothing save an oily scum and four men on the surface of the water . This was the record so far , out of many quick kills : it still had power to shock . But then all the losses , the deaths , the scale of slaughter , still startled and moved them . They should have known that things were just warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GrapplingIThey started the new year with a piece of domestic drama that in its untidiness and its inherent futility somehow reflected the wider battle . The centre of the storm was a small able seaman by the name of Gregg . Gregg was one of the fo'c's'le party , in Morell 's division : the latter knew little about him save that he was quiet and dependable , and had never been in any sort of trouble during the whole of the fifteen months he had been in Compass Rose . It was therefore something of a surprise when Gregg failed to return on board at the end of their stay in harbour , and was not to be found by the time the ship left on her first convoy of the year . They sailed without him , after leaving with the shore authorities sufficient particulars to ensure that he would not be stranded on the dockside when he returned . The post mortem and the clearing up would have to wait : all that was involved now was the nuisanceof being short-handed -- the trouble in store , like the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the sea claimed all their attention . But certainly the trouble was there , when they got back home . Absence without leave was sufficiently serious : to miss one 's ship completely was in a higher scale of crime altogether , since if one did so , and the ship was involved in any kind of action , one was liable as well to a charge of desertion in the face of the enemy . Ericson , surveying Able Seaman137The Cruel Sea 1941 : GrapplingGregg when he was brought up at Captain 's Defaulters , on the morning after their return to harbour , waited with some interest to hear what he had to say . He might conceivably have some legitimate excuse that would disentangle him altogether  --  thoughit was hard to see what this could be . Alternatively , there might be something that would lessen the seriousness of the charge . Ericson hoped for this extenuation , since Gregg was a decent kid who had not been in trouble before : otherwise the thing might involve sendinghim to detention , and he would probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything at all . The evidence on one side was simple : he had left the ship one afternoon , he had missed her when she sailed , he had reportedback on board the morning she returned to harbour : the absence without leave for seventeen days was not disputable . But when Ericson asked for an explanation , he was met by a shake of the head , and a muttered " Nothing to say , sir " that brought him up short . " You must have something to say , " said Ericson sharply . He looked at the small sandy-haired figure in front of him , and tried to analyse the man 's expression . It was not quite apologetic , it was not quite shy , it was certainly not rebellious ; it had a sort of submissive determination that was , in the circumstances , rather brave . . . . " I want to know why you left the ship , " Ericson went on , " and what you 've been doing while we 've been at sea . You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious trouble . " They all stared at Gregg : the Captain , Lockhart , Morell , and Tallow , who had marched him up to the table . The expressionson the ring of faces varied : the Captain , as judge , was non-committal , Morell looked puzzled , Lockhart wore his First Lieutenant 's disciplinary frown , and Tallow exhibitedthe professional disgust of a man who had no patience with defaulters and not the smallest belief in their excuses . In the middle of it all , braving the storm , Able Seaman Gregg preserved his unblinking air of reserve . " When did you last138see your father ? " thought Lockhart inconsequently , and frowned yet more determinedly still . This sort of thing was no longer allowed to be funny . " Well , " said Ericson after a pause . " I 'm waiting . " " Nothing to say , sir , " repeated Gregg in the same flat tone . Tallow drew in his breath with a sharp hiss , and Ericson , hearing it , was somehow reminded of the whole weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind this moment . Soon he would have to apply that tradition , balancing the seesaw of crime and punishment , and the idea seemed wasteful and futile , when all it boiled down to was himself and a forlorn able seaman who would not try to save his own skin . He wanted to find the real reason that lay behind it , and he wanted to rescue Gregg from a situation that , with the best will in the world , must always be weighted against him . He tried again . " That 's just silly , " he said reasonably . " I do n't know what you 're trying to cover up , but I should n't think it 's worth it . You know that I can send you to detention for this ? " " Yes , sir , " mumbled Gregg . " I do n't want to do that , because you have n't been in trouble before and your divisional officer tells me you 're a good worker . But unless you give me an explanation I have n't any alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to miss the ship , and what have you been doing the last seventeendays ? " There was still no answer . Gregg looked stolidly out in front of him , his eyes just below the level of Ericson 's chin , maintaining the foolish contest of wills , which could only have one end . The noises of the ship and the dockside seemed suspended , waiting for the scene to resolve itself . To Lockhartit seemed , fancifully , that this might never happen , that Gregg need never answer , that they might wait there for ever , till they all grew old and the war was over and no one cared any more . . . . Perhaps Ericson had something of the same feeling , for he straightened up suddenly and said : " Stand over . " 139The Cruel Sea " Stand over , " repeated Tallow , with the tiniest edge of doubt in his voice . And then , with more force : " On caps ! " he continued automatically . " About turn ! Quick march ! " When Gregg was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll see him again tomorrow , " he said . " In the meantime , you 'd better have a talk with him and try and find out what it 's all about . I do n't want to send him up without knowing what 's behind it . " " Yes , sir , " said Morell . " Is he married ? " " Yes , sir . " " Ask him if there 's anything wrong there . . . . Cox-swain ! " " Sir ? " " Stand Gregg over till tomorrow morning . " " Aye , aye , sir . " " Next case . " But when Morell saw Gregg later that day , down in his cabin , he took a different line . There was less need for formality here , and less occasion for care in what one said : he could treat Gregg as he would have treated a witness in court , a witness who knew something but might have to be wheedled or bullied or tricked into revealing it . With no one listening , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating could be stretched a long way outside the normal pattern . " The Captain 's doing his best for you , " Morell said shortly , when Gregg once more repeated his stubborn " nothing-to-say " formula . " Probably a damned sight more than you deserve , but that 's nothing to do with me . What he 's trying to get at is , what made you suddenly walk ashore and miss the ship . Why do n't you tell him ? " " I do n't want to say , sir , " said Gregg , with the same finality as before . " You 'd rather have a month 's detention ? " Gregg 's expression changed to a sulky frown , but he said nothing . " That 's what it would mean , you know , " Morell went on. 1941 : Grappling " It 'll be a black mark against you for the rest of your time in the Navy , it 'll always be there , on your conduct sheet . " " I 'm only in for the war , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's going to last ? You want to get on , do n't you ? You do n't want to stay an able seaman for two or three years more ? How can you be recommendedfor leading seaman if you do this sort of thing , and then refuse to say anything about it ? " " I do n't know , sir . " " You 'd better talk , Gregg . " Morell changed his tone . " What 's it all about ? Where did you go to ? Did you go home ? " After a pause : " Yes , sir , " said Gregg , swallowing . " I went to London . " " Well , that 's something . . . . Is there anything wrong there ? " " Not now , sir . " " Was there ? " " Yes . " " What ? " The obstinate , blank look returned . " I do n't want to say . " " You know I wo n't repeat it to anyone . " " You 'll repeat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have to . . . . And that 's only two people , anyway : it wo n't go any further . " Gregg shook his head . He was wavering , but he still could not face whatever it was that filled his mind . " It will , if I say it up at the table . It 'll be all over the ship then . " Morell frowned . " What you say at Defaulters does n't go all over the ship . You know that perfectly well . . . . Now let 's get this straight . There was some trouble at home ? " " Yes , sir . " " With your wife ? " " Yes . " " What sort of trouble ? " Gregg gestured , rather pathetically . " The usual . " " How did you hear about it ? " The Cruel Sea " Someone wrote  --  a pal at home . " " And you went off home to try to fix it up ? " " Yes . " " Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sec what it 's got you into , " said Morell hardly . " What the hell do you think your officers are for , if not to help you when this sort of thing happens ? " " I did n't know , sir . . . . I wanted it kept a secret . " " How can it be a secret , when you 're absent without leave for seventeen days ? " " Bur no one knows about it still , sir  --  only you . " " But you 're going to tell the Captain , " said Morell . " I do n't want to do that . I 'd rather go to cells , and havedone with it . " " Do n't be a bloody fool , " said Morell . " I do n't say you 'll get off , but it might make a lot of difference . He 's a human being , you know . " " But I ca n't tell it all up at the table , " said Gregg desperately . " Not with all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be listening . You know you can see the Captain privately , if it 's a family matter , do n't you ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well ? " Gregg came to a sudden decision . " I 'd like to do that , sir . " " Why did n't you say so this morning ? " " I did n't think of it . " " You 'd have saved yourself a lot of trouble . And been a lot more popular . " Morell stood up . " All right  --  I 'll arrange for you to see him this afternoon . " Gregg looked scared . " What do I say , sir ? " " You tell him exactly why you went home , and what happened when you got there . " " And it wo n't go any further ? " " No . " " And I 'll maybe get off ? " 1941 : Grappling " I do n't know . Probably not altogether . But it 'll give you a better chance than simply refusing to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " Yes . " Gregg smiled suddenly . " Thanks a lot , sir . " " There 's nothing to thank me for . " It was time to return to normal , time to drop the curtain again . " You 're not clear yet , not by a long chalk . Now get back to work . 1 ' 11 send for you when the Captain wants to see you . And this time , tell him the truth  --  everything  --  and do n't waste any more time . " It was doubtful if Gregg could have brought himself to tell his story , even then , if he had not been coaxed and persuaded up to the very last moment . But Ericson , forewarned by Morell of what was at the heart of the trouble , was at special pains to make it easy for him . With Gregg in his cabin he gave ostentatious orders that he was not to be disturbed : he made him sit down , he gave him a cigarette , and he led off his questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no embarrassment about telling him everything . And when the man still hesitated , sitting on the edge of his chair , stiff and sweating in his number-one suit with the gold badges , Ericson suddenly leant forward and said : " You 're married , Gregg , are n't you ? " " Yes , sir . " " Did you go home to see your wife ? " Gregg 's eyes flickered upwards once , and then down again His voice was not much above a whisper . " Yes , sir . " " You 'd better tell me about it , " said Ericson . " You want to tell somebody , do n't you ?  --  apart from the trouble you 're in over it ? " He looked away as the other man struggled to answer . But the lead was enough , the balance was tipped : now at last , up in the quiet cabin , with the sun filtering through the portholeand the muted sound of water running against the hull , Gregg told his appalling story . It had begun with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from her last trip : a letter from a pal. 142 143The Cruel SeaDear Tom , it said of course it 's none of my business , but I 've been up and down the old street once or twice , thinking of calling on Edith and asking how you 're getting along , and then I have n't liked to go in because she 's got company already . Dear Tom , there 's a lot of talk about it , a car outside the house at all hours , they say he 's a traveller for one of the big firms . I seen him once saying goodbye , they were laughing . I did n't like it , Tom , I thought I 'd write and tell you . If I done wrong I 'm sorry , you know me , always putting my foot in it . Keep cheerful , you better ask for a bit of leave and straighten it up , it all comes of these chaps being in a reserved bloody occupation , shooting 's too good for some , yours till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Gregg , twisting his hands together . At that moment there was more than certainty in his voice : something like defiance . " I had to go , straight away . When you get a letter like that . . . I was n't due for leave even next time it came round , and that was three weeks ahead . I had to see what was going on . We 've only been married six months . " And so he had gone , without a word to anyone , that same afternoon : slipping ashore with the libertymen , catching the last London train from Lime Street station , arriving about eleven at night , getting the bus out to Highgate . " What happened then ? " asked Ericson , when the pause had stretched to unbearable limits . " It 's a little house , sir , " said Gregg , " a nice little house . It used to be my mother 's  --  she left it to me . When I walked up from the bus stop , it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , swallowed up in misery : he was relivingthe horrible moment . " When I got to the house , the car was outside the door , and  --  and there was a light on up-stairs . " Gregg paused , and frowned : the imprint of emotion on the smooth round face was very moving . " See what I mean , sir ? Downstairs , it was dark . " " Yes , " said Ericson , " yes , I see . " 1441941 : GrapplingFor a moment Gregg had n't known what to do , he 'd been so taken aback , so horrified , so sick with it . He had stood in the dark street , looking from the car up to the light , the terriblebedroom light . " I did n't need telling any more , sir : there was enough to bet on , there . . . . I waited a long time , thinking what to do , and then I thought : Well , give her a chance , she 's only a kid really , and lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistling a bit , and I made a lot of noise opening the door and going inside . . . . You see , I love her , sir , " he said , with simple determination , as if only he knew about love . " We 've been married just the six months . " But now there was a long silence that Ericson could not break , so clearly pitiful was the feeling behind it : the word " love " must have struck a hopeless note of memory . When Gregg started again , it was as if the key had now changed to something darker , more horrible still : as if this part of the story , which he had not yet shared with anyone , had a special forbidden quality that made them both guilty , teller and hearer alike . Gregg 's wife had called out when she heard the door go : scared , she sounded , and there was a lot of moving about . . . . She said : " Who is it ? " and he answered : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel angry and sick at the same time . He had switched on the light in the hall and waited , knowing quite well what they were doing and what the whispering meant : they were wondering if it could be bluffed out , what the evidence was , how much he had seen and guessed . But evidently they soon decided that it was hopeless , for now a man 's voice spoke quite loud , and when Edith called out : " I 'm coming down , " it had a sulky note of defiance . " I still did n't know what to do , sir  --  I could n't make sense of it at all . She 'd always been so different , there 'd never been anything like this . We were only married a couple of leaves back  --  you read the banns for us , here on board . " Ericson suddenly remembered that this was so : he could even recall , with a queer distaste , having read " Edith Tappett , spinster , of the Parish of Highgate , London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unromantic a name could be like . Now he knew : now they both knew . . . . " Pretty soon she came down , " Gregg went on , speaking rather fast and looking at the floor . " She had n't got dressed , even then : she was all anyhow , in her dressing-gown . " Ericson thought : that 's something he 'll never forget : what a horrible thing to have in one 's mind , for ever and ever . . . . But Gregg was hurrying on , leaving one scene for another yet more terrible , as if his choice were so rich and so wide that he need not stay long over one aspect of it . " She 'd had a bit to drink , sir  --  I could tell that . But that was n't enough for her to talk the way she did . You 'd have thought it was all my fault . I 've got a friend , ' she said , I was n't expecting you '  --  just like that . And when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ? ' she said : There 's no need to shout , Tom , you do n't want any trouble , surely ? ' And then she called out : Walter , ' and after a minute the man came down the stairs . He did n't care , " said Gregg , with fury and misery in his voice , " he walked down the stairs doing up his coat . . . . A big flashy chap , well dressed , full of himself  --  you could tell he did this sort of thing every day of the week . " Gregg looked up and then down again , flushing , remembering a deep humiliation . " He was twice the size of me , sir . I could n't even  --  I could n't " His voice tailed off into an empty realm of cowardice and despair , where only his defeat , his still-raw shame , was real . " Never mind that , " said Ericson quickly , as if there were no significance in the pause , the moment of abasement . " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You should have let me know , Tom , " was what his wife had said . " How was I to tell you 'd be back ? " And then she had actually introduced them , and the man had said : " Ah , the sailor home from the sea , " and Gregg had told him to get out , and the man had answered : " We do n't want any unpleasantness , thank you . " It was all part of a topsy-turvy nightmare in which Gregg could not get his bearings at all . " After he 'd gone , we had it out properly , but I could n't get1461941 : Grapplingher to see it straight at all . " Gregg 's voice still held some of the astonishment of that moment . " She said she 'd got used to  --  to love , sir , with me , and she could n't do without it . She said it had been going on for two months . She said that this chap had talked her into it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said it was the war , and lots of ' people did it . . . . She acted like a different person . In the end we just went off to bed . She was with me that night , sir , though  --  though I could hardly touch her at first . " There was now a much longer pause , almost as if Gregg had finished putting his side of the affair and were waiting for the verdict . But that could not be the end of the story , thought Ericson , looking down at his desk : it was horrible enough , and it excused a good deal as far as Gregg 's behaviourwent , but it only accounted for two days  --  three at the outside  --  and he had been away for seventeen . . . . He waited , wanting to prompt the other man but unable to find a way that would not sound brutal or indifferent : he had been moved by the recital  --  horrified , even  --  and he did not want it to seem as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it aside in favour of a strict , immovable justice . But presently Gregg took up the story again , without any reminder : perhaps he had merely been collecting his thoughts , perhaps there was worse to come . " That was the first day , sir , " he said , " and I stayed two more , just to make sure  --  I 'd still be back in time to catch the ship , and that way it did n't seem it would be so bad . " He looked swiftly at the Captain , aware that he was taking a lot for granted , but the latter made no sign : the verdict , the judgement , was to come at the very end . . . . " She was just like she used to be in the old days , " Gregg went on : " she stopped talking about the other chap , she did n't say anything more about these funny ideas , she seemed to have forgotten all about it , except when I spoke about it at the end . But before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she promised faithfully to give it another try . So I went off to catch the early train  --  " Ericson could tell there was yet another climax coming , another stroke of pain , from Gregg's147The Cruel Seaswifter , shorter breathing , and the way his words came faster and faster , " and I missed it because of the traffic , and I came back , thinking I 'd spend the day with her and catch the train in the evening , and she was n't there  --  the house was empty , and she 'd taken her case as well . " This time Ericson was afraid that Gregg was going to break down altogether : his voice came to a sudden stop , and his mouth , working and trembling uncontrollably , seemed on the point of puckering into tears . It was a moment of surrender : he looked young and capable and smart in his uniform , and then , above the neatly rolled collar and the clean white flannel , his defeated face destroyed the picture utterly . Without a word Ericson went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed the glass to Gregg : because  it was so unusual a thing to do , so far outside the normal , it was capable of being a failure and a mistake . For a moment Ericson wondered if at a later date , when Gregg had forgotten the worst of this matter , he might translate the occasion into different terms : perhaps boasting cheekily in the mess-decks : " Trouble ? Not me ! The skipper gave me a tot of whisky and told me to come back any time . . . . ' ' But no , it would nor be like that . The giving of the whisky seemed to surprise ( Gregg into an effort of control : as he sipped it , looking round the cabin and out through the sunlit porthole , his mouth and face firmed again , and he prepared to go on . What he had said , and what he had still to say , was desolate , but not too desolate for ordered speech . It was possible , he had thought , that his wife might be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she had said nothing about going , she was in the mood for impulsive action . So to Edgware he went , by bus , only to draw another blank . " She was n't there , and she had n't been there for weeks . I could see her mother thought it was funny , but I was n't answering any questions . " then I went to see my pal , the one that wrote the letter , but he 'd gone back after his leave and they did n't know anything . So I left it , and went home again . " He had been alone in the empty , silent house for a week. 148As he dismissed it thus , in a single sentence , Lricson tried to visualize what it must have been like : the waiting , the loneliness , the suspicion , the knowledge of betrayal . " I had to stay , sir , in case she came back , " he said , and Ericson could not , for pity , deny the claim . " I 'd have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look  --  there was the whole of London . And then I got an idea , I should have thought of it before . There was a married friend of hers , woman I never cared for , over the other side of London , down White City way . I thought she might be staying there , so I went over , and asked at the house . She said the wife had been there , a few days back , but had gone away again , she did n't know where . " The story was pouring out now , unchecked by any reserve : in the silent cabin the words and sentences , clumsy and ill-formed , yet flowed with an eloquent readiness towardstheir cruel end . " I thought she was telling lies , there was something in the way she looked , so I hung about a bit , watching for the car , and then I turned into the first pub I came to , for a pint and something to eat , and there they were , the two of them , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was laughing , and then she looked up and said : Look who 's here . ' " Ericson thought he was going to stop , as he had stopped many times before , but the whisky had done its work  --  or perhaps it was the story itself , which could not be delayed at so crucial a point . " I asked what she was doing there , instead of being at home , " Gregg went on immediately , " and she said there was no harm in having a drink . Then I said : Where 've you been the last week ? ' and she said : Staying with Else '  --  that 's this woman . I said I was n't going to stand for it , and the man said : What you need is a drink . ' I said : I do n't want a drink from you  --  if this goes on I 'm going to see about a divorce . ' " I did n't really mean it , I just wanted to give him a scare . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said : How about you coming down the stairs that night ? ' and he said : I was just saying good night to Mrs. Gregg  --  it was quite inno  --  . 149The Cruel Sea I 94 I : Grapplingcent . ' And then he winked at her and she laughed like a  --  like a rotten tart . " " What an accurate description , " thought Ericson , " how can he want her now , how can he feel anything but hatred and disgust ? " But in Gregg 's voice there was neither of these : when he said " rotten tart " he was not condemning , he was mourning what he and she had lost . There was no trace of rationality in it , no balancing of right and wrong : there was simply the incalculable instinct of love , of what people feel  --  or feel that they should feel  --  when they undertaketo bind themselves to other people . Even now , it seemed , Gregg did not question the validity of that binding : the bargain might be bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sprang from " love , " a word in a book , a scene in a film , a foolish core of determination in a man 's brain . Gregg was continuing , with quiet assurance . " I was going to say something to him about that , sir , but then he said : You need n't worry , anyway , I 'm off to the States next week , big buying job . ' And the wife said : First I 've heard of it , Walter , when are you going ? ' and he said : Thursday  --  I 'll come round to say good-bye , ' and I said : Like hell you will  --  you do n't come near the house again . ' It was funny , sir , he did n't try to argue the toss about that , he just said : I-lave it your own way , then ' ; I think what I said about the divorce must have rattled him a bit , but perhaps he 'd had enough of it anyway . Then he stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you again one of these days , ' and she said , very surprised : Do you mean good-bye , Walter ? ' and he walked off , and by and by she started crying and I took her home . " At that , Gregg paused and looked at Ericson , as if judging how he would receive what he was going to say next : he was near the end now , and he must , in spite of his earlier indifference , have felt it necessary to justify himself while he had the chance . Ericson was careful to keep his expression as non-committal as possible : even now , there was no verdict to be given , no comforting words to forestall the threat ofdiscipline . This was still a private hearing , out of the main stream , with the normal course of events held in suspense . Gregg seemed to gather himself together . " That was the Friday , sir , " he said . " I 'd been adrift ten days already , and this chap did n't leave till the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I still could n't go , sir , I still could n't leave her , even now it was n't safe : he might change his mind and come round to the house , and if he did n't , I knew she 'd be off to meet him if she got half a chance . . . . So I thought I 'd stay on , and keep her there with me : I was in the rattle anyway , whatever happened , and there was only one way to make sure she did n't see him . Even then it was touch and go . We went to the pictures once , and she got up to go to the Ladies ' , and after a bit I went out myself , and I just caught her as she was going out through the front entrance . After that , we stayed at home all the time . . . . She used to cry a lot : she was always on at me , wanting to go out  --  I was afraid to go to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her clothes and hid the key where she could n't find it . " He passed his hand over his forehead . " But one night  --  it was the Wednesday , the night before this chap left  --  she waited till I was asleep and broke the cupboard open and got dressed , and then something woke me up , and she tried to run for it , and I got to the door first and she was screaming and pulling at me , I thought she 'd go mad . . . . I stayed awake all that night , to make sure , and then in the morning she saw it was too late , and she kind of gave up and I knew it was all right to leave . . . . I was n't going to talk to her at all about it , I wanted to forget it and start afresh ; but when I was saying good-bye she said : Will you be in trouble ? ' and I said yes , I would , and she said : I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going to have a baby . " Ericson looked at the floor . There was only one question to be asked , and not for a million pounds could he have asked it . But then suddenly Gregg asked and answered it for him , in one swift brave stroke . " The kid 'll be mine , sir , and that 's all there is to it . " The Cruel Sea 1941 : Grappling " Love again , " thought Ericson , with wonder in his heart : love the unfailing cure , no matter how hideous the deception , how vile the betrayal . . . . Now that the story was done , he wanted to dispose of it as quickly as possible : it was clear that Gregg could not be punished for something that had tried him too high , that he was simply not equipped to deal with , and there was a wise provision for mercy available in such cases . But in spite of his willingness to spare Gregg any further ordeal , there was one point to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only in fairness to other men who , caught in the same circumstances , did not take the law into their own hands but stayed within the framework of discipline . I lc turned in his chair . " Thank you for telling me this , Gregg  --  I shall think it over before your case comes up again tomorrow . At the moment there 's only one thing I want to say , but it 's something you ought to remember . " He summoned an incisivenesshe did not wholly feel . " Your officers are n't there just to run the ship and give orders  --  they 're there to help you as well . In a case like this , if you 'd come to me as soon as you got that letter I could have given you special leave , and then you would n't have had to break ship . And we could have arranged for someone to visit your wife , while you were away . " He smiled  --  very briefly , for it was not a smiling moment : the miserable face opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just remember that the Royal Navy has a routine for everything , whether it 's for going into battle , or for taking a shell out of a gun when it 's jammed and may explode , or for helping in domestic trouble like yours . It 's usually the only workable routine there is , the best available , because the Navy looks after its own . " He saw that for some reason Gregg was near to tears again , and he broke off : the point had been made , and he could not bring himself to hammer it further home . " That 's all for now . Ask the First Lieutenant to see me . " When Gregg had gone , Ericson sat for a long time in thought . On one point , thought was straightforward . Gregg 's story would have to be checked  --  that could be done on the152spot , in London , as a matter of routine  --  and if it were true , he could legitimately let him off altogether : even though Gregg had done wrong , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in war . . . . But he knew that the story was true  --  and it was here that thought strayed uncontrollably : there had been no acting in that anguish , no lies behind the pitiful story . Some women were worthless , and some were getting bored with the war : when the two things coincided , no result , however mean or sordid , should ever come as a surprise. 2Presently the turn of the year was left behind , and the lengthening days that marked the spring brought them one respite at least  --  easier nights at sea . Morell 's middle watch , indeed , was now the only one that passed in complete darkness ; and soon , as spring gave way to early summer , even he was allowed a partial relief from the strain of hanging on to the convoy and guessing at black shadows for four hours on end . During the last half-hour of his watch , toward four o'clock in the morning , there would be a faint lifting of the darkness in the east : through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harder outline , and the ships that lay in his line of sight began to abandon their gloomy neutrality and grow into three-dimensional figures again . By the time Lockhart came up to relieve him , at the change of the watch , it was possible to distinguish in detail the upperworksof Compass Rose and the faces of the men up on the bridge : when they said good morning to each other , it was a matter of recognition and not guesswork . And then , within half an hour , it was the dawn , and the start of another Jay  --  a day further out into the Atlantic , or a day nearer home . Lockhart would survey the calm collection of ships , and perhapsdrop back a mile or so to encourage the stragglers : the Captain would come up , grey and bristly from an uncom-153The Cruel Sea 1941 : Grapplingfortable night in his berth in the wheelhouse , and look about him and sniff the air , and then wander from side to side of the bridge , sextant in hand , ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally , to mark the end of the night , Tomlinson the young steward sidled up and collected the sandwich plates and the derelict cocoa cups , the debris of the night 's picnic . That was the simple outline of dawn , as it came to Compass Rose on dozens and scores of mornings ; but many dawns had more to them than this . Often , tragically , daybreak was the time for counting heads , for closing gaps in the ranks , for signalling to Viperous the total of survivors and the total of the dead . For now , with 1941 advancing , they were a year older , and so was the war ; and the further it progressed the deeper they seemed to be involved in failure and setback . The tide was now set and running strongly against all Allied shipping : over a full two thirds of the Atlantic the attackers had the initiative , and they held on to it and gave it ruthless force and effectiveness . It was like a dark stain spreading all over this huge sea : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no ship could count on safety from hour to hour , seemed swiftly to infect a wider and wider circle . In the background , the big ships skirmished and occasionally came to blows : the Hipper , the Scharnhorst , and the Gneisenau emerged on raiding forays , the Hood was sunk by one prodigious shot at eleven miles ' range , and then , in a swift counterstroke , the destruction of the Bismarck squared the account . But these were dramatic surprises , highlights of a ponderous and intermittent warfare : plying to and fro ceaselessly , the convoys fought their longer and bloodier battle against a multiplying enemy . The enemy was planning as well as multiplying . At last , the U-boats were co-ordinating their attack : they now hunted in packs , six or seven in a group , quartering a huge area of the convoy route and summoning their full strength as soon as a contact was obtained . They had the use of French , Norwegian , and Baltic ports , fully equipped for shelter and maintenance : they had long-range aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had training , they had better weapons , they had the spur of success . . . . The first concerted pack-attack sank ten out of twenty-two ships in one convoy : the monthly record of sinkings mounted  --  fifrythreein one month , fifty-seven in another . The U-boats gradually extended their operations further westward , until there was no longer , in mid-Atlantic , a safe dispersal-area for the convoys ; neither from Britain , Canada , nor Iceland ( which had now been drawn fully into the strategic pattern ) could complete air cover be provided , and the escorts themselveswere limited in their endurance . So the stain spread , and the ships went down . There were countermeasures : patrolling aircraft extended their range , a number of merchantships were provided with fighters launched by catapult , and the quality of the weapons in the escorts improved slowly : to mark this improvement , one month in the middle of 1941 saw seven U-boats sent to the bottom  --  the highest total of the war . But seven U-boats was not enough : there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough escorts to screen the convoys : there was still a vast margin that could only be covered by luck and human endeavour , and neither of these could match the standard and the pace of the enemy , or stop the slaughter . Of this slaughter , Compass Rose saw her full share . It was no longer a surprise when the alarm bell sounded , no longer a shock to see the derelict humanity that was hoisted over the side after a ship went down : it was no longer moving to watch the dying and bury the dead . They developed  --  they had to develop  --  a professional inhumanity toward their job , a lack of feeling which was the best guarantee of efficiency : time spent in contemplating this evil warfare was time wasted , and rage or pity was something that could only come between them and their work . Hardened to pain and destruction , taking it all for granted , they concentrated as best they could on fighting back and on saving men for one purpose only  --  so that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruel SeaFerraby and Baker , the two juvenile leads , shared the first watch , from eight until midnight . Following the contemporarycorvette fashion , they had both grown beards : in some curious way it made them look younger instead of older , and also rather unconvincing , like the naval personnel in a provincialrevival of H.M.S. Pinafore . ( " Nice drop of horticultureyou 've got there , " a visitor to the wardroom had said , surveying the effect : the remark had earned , from Morell , the highest raised eyebrows of the war so far . ) Baker , who had arrived on board a year previously as a shy young man with a vague background in accountancy , had shed none of his diffidence in the intervening period : he and Ferraby were alike in many ways  --  in their automatic acceptance of authority , no matter how flimsy its basis , in their lack of confidence , in their fear that sooner or later the test of war would reveal their shortcomings . . . . When they talked together , it was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , in an outer office , they are waiting to be interviewed for a job they do not think they will get : it is no good showingoff to each other , because neither is worth impressing , and raised voices or a cocksure attitude may be overheard , and lead to their disqualification before they have even faced the boss . . . . But latterly , Ferraby had secured an appreciablelead : he was now a father , and when the two of them were together he exhibited the first stirrings of paternal consequence . " Did you mind it being a girl ? " asked Baker one night , when , as usually happened at sea , the conversation turned to the gentler background of home . " Or did you really want a boy ? " " It did n't seem to matter what it was , as long as she was all right , " said Ferraby frankly . " You get so worried towards the end . . . . Of course she had her mother there , to look after her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even now , he could not think of that night , just before the end of his last leave , without acute discomfort : Mavis 's cry as she woke suddenly , about midnight , the frantic telephoning , the ambulance that would not come , the agonized waiting past1941 : Grapplingdawn , past midday , past half another night . . . . To see Mavis and the baby together , next morning , two heads on the pillow instead of one , had made up for most of it ; but it could not wholly kill the force of memory . " It was a bit of luck I was on leave when it started , " Ferraby went on . " Otherwise I do n't know what I 'd have done , thinking about it happening while we were at sea . " " My turn for leave next , " said Baker , reacting to the cherished word . " Two more convoys , I should say  --  about six weeks . " Six weeks . . . . That started , in Ferraby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share with Baker , or with anyone else . Six weeks was a long time in the Atlantic , at this stage , when the next six hours  --  or six minutes , for that matter  --  might bring them disaster . There were so many U-boats on the hunt : sooner or later , he was sure , one of them was going to get Compass Rose in its sights . Ferraby was never free of that fear , nowadays : it was as if , when Bennett left , he had to exchange one tyranny for another , as if the fear of Bennett would only give way to the fear of being torpedoed . Of all of them on board , Ferraby was the least hardened to what was going on : he could not forget the nodding head of the dead man , that first time they had picked up survivors , he could not forget the recurrent alarm , the inevitable attack , the slim chance of survival . Even now , as he talked to Baker or looked at the ship they were stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the next few moments might bring : it was getting towardmidnight , the end of their watch , and this was the time when things so often happened  --  the bang , the flare from a torpedoed ship , the explosion in the heart of the convoy . And if they did not happen in this first watch , they could happen in the next one , the middle  --  and that was worst of all . At midnight , every night at sea , Ferraby was free to go below , and turn in , and sleep undisturbed till breakfast time : he had never found this possible save at the very beginningand the very end of a voyage , when they were in safety and shelter . There was something in the very act of156 157The Cruel Sealying down below the waterline that tortured his imagina , tion : it seemed quite impossible that Compass Rose would not , be torpedoed during these dark hours , and that the torpedo , when it struck , would not rip its way into the very cabin where he lay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the deep of the Atlantic , these thoughts returned to him : he would lie there , while the ship rolled and groaned and the water sluiced past a few inches from his hunk , sweating and staring at the bulkhead and the rivets that bound the thin plating together . That plating was all that stood between him and the black water : he waited in terror for the iron clang , the explosion , the inrush of water , the certainty of being trapped and choked before he could make a move . One terriblenight he had managed to get to sleep , even though there had been warnings of a submarine pack in their vicinity : after an hour of sweating nervousness he had dozed off , and then , between waking and sleeping , he had heard a monstrous explosionthat seemed to come from within the ship itself , and as he leapt from his bunk the alarm bell clanged , followed by a rush of feet , and he had felt a surge of blinding panic as he raced for the ladder and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last he gasped the free air , the scene was like a scene from hell . One of the escorts had fired a snowflake rocket  --  a big flare that could illuminatea two-mile circle and was meant to lime-light any submarinethat might be on the surface : its yellow brilliance now hung over the wild water , showing him the convoy straining against the storm , and Sorrel racing off to starboard , hunting and guessing , and then , quite close to them , a ship , badly listed , already on her way down . Even as he watched her , there was a sudden gush of flame from her funnel , and she seemed to fall apart : a filthy waft of burnt oil and paint and steam came toward them , the very smell of death , and she was gone , quenched by the sea . Ferraby leaned against a stanchion , physically sick : that ship might have been Compass Rose , and the men now trapped and drowned might have been their own crew , and the place where the torpedo had struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , he could not bear to go below after he came off watch : he would wander about the upper deck , or curl up in a corner at the back of the bridge , or in the alleyway by the wheelhouse : wakeful till dawn , fingering his safety light and his blown-up life-jacket , waiting in taut apprehension for their turn to come . He had seen other men like this , rescued survivors who would not go below again even to snatch a meal , and he had wondered at their fear and their obsession . Now he wondered no more . But this was something he could share with no one  --  and especially not with Mavis , who now must never know the extent of his terror and his danger . They had taken a small house outside Liverpool , and he saw her every time Compass Rose was in harbour : the recurrent meeting and separation and good-bye was sweet and harassing at the same time , not helping him at all . . . . More and more , the war was makingdemands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bankrupt spirit could not meet. 3Lockhart had come to rely on Ericson , and to admire him unstintingly in the process . He was everything a captain should be : the centre of calm on the bridge , whatever was happening , a fine seaman who could handle Compass Rose with absolute assurance , a tireless personality who took infinitepains over every part of his job , whether it was roundingup stragglers , or fixing their position at sea , or cherishing their paintwork when they came alongside the oiler . He seemed irreplaceable : it was therefore something of a shock when he was suddenly put out of action , and Lockhart had to take the ship himself for the last five days of a convoy . Ericsonwas thrown out of his bunk one night when Compass Rose , at her most captious , achieved a forty-five-degree roll , and he broke a rib : the slightest movement gave him **25;5951;TOOLONG did n't know what a lover in this sense was , nor , I imagine , did Sally ; but the words sounded splendid and romantic . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lots and lots of men must love a woman like that . The pictures , I must say , did n't mean much to Inc , because I knew nothing about painting and had never heard so much as the names of these painters . What I was more impressed with was the spaciousness of a house no bigger than our own . All the Victorian knickknackery that had ever been devised had come to rest with us . Here it seemed as though each century washed up a few things of perfection and that nothing else was permitted to remain . We finished the tour at the top of the house . Here , as I in ours , Sally had her quarters , and in this one particular , the Victorian rule was observed . The stairs were oil-clothed , the room was bleak , bleaker than mine , for Whaley had made a difference . A couple of old rugs , worn down to their basic fabric , were on the floor ; a plain deal table was in the middle of the room , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose when we entered and curtseyed to me . Sally introduced her as Mademoiselle Lapage , her governess . She had nothing to say fe- erself . She was very correct , very silent , saying only to Whaley , as we left : " You will return Miss Sally at four ? Yes ? It is understood by his lordship . " We returned Sally at four , and what we did in the meantime I do n't clearly remember . Some time thereafter Sally and I were doing so many things together . After the early morning , that first day is blurred. 7Things came into focus again late that night . I have learned since of what happened up to the moment when 1 saw something for myself . Lord Burnage drove the wagonette back from Epsom and dropped his passengers here and there till none were left but Papa and Mama . Finally they pulled up outside our house , the three got down , and the coachman began to drive away the wagonette . Lord Burnage , Papa and Mama were standing near the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the door into the wagonette at the back , which had been insecurely fastened , flew open and struck Mama . It was not much of a blow and merely bruised her arm , but it caused her to start back suddenly . She tripped on her long skirt and fell . It was this that did the damage . The men stooped to raise her , each holding an arm , but when she got her feet to the ground , she gave a groan and would have fallen again but for their support . One of her legs was broken. 40Threllfall by this time had opened the door , and Papa shouted to him : " Send Stott across at once to Dr. Mackenzie . No ! I 'll go myself . I 'll bring him back with me . " Dr. Mackenzie 's house was not two minutes ' walk away , and my father relinquished Mama to Lord Burnage and started to run , which was in itself an extraordinary sight . Lord Burnage said : " Put an arm round my neck . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had not slept since going to bed . The excitements of the day tended to keep me awake , and , too , I was hoping that , late though it was , Mama would come up and tell me something of her adventures . I heard the wagonette stop outside the house , got out of bed , and went to the window . I heard Mama 's cry and the perturbed voices of the men , and then I saw that extraordinary spectacle of Papa running , now a shadow , now clear in the light of a lamp . I was afraid . Somethingterrible was happening . . . . Mama was dying . . . . I pulled on a dressing gown and went swiftly downstairs . As I reached the last turn of the stairs I saw Threllfall come out of the drawing room and hurry toward the kitchen quarters , shouting some order to a housemaid . The drawing - room door was wide open , but I did not go in . I stopped my hasty course just in time . What I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sofa . A shaded standard lamp showered a soft light upon her , but I could not see her face , and she could not see me , for Lord Burnage , with his back to me , was between us . He was bending over her , holding her hand to his lips . The shock of seeing them in that posture overwhelmed me . The very vagueness of my thoughts added to my consternation . I turned and fled noiselesslyon my bare feet to the first landing , and stood trembling there till Papa came breathlessly in with the doctor . " Calm , calm , Sir Richard , if you please , " Dr. Mackenzie was saying . " I expect there 's nothing here that a week or two wo n't cure . " CHAPTER FOURYI WISH I had clearer memories of my father , and happier ones . But happier is not exactly the word I want . He dulled me , rather than made me unhappy . A day could be shining like silver , and some word of his , some gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver cup . When he was gone , this cloudy tarnish would dissolve , and there would be a shining again . Our visit to the Crystal41Palace at Sydenham comes to my mind . That was three years after I had seen the Queen open the first palace in Hyde Park . Oh , what a disappointing day that was ! The palace was not the same at all . I think now that it was far more beautiful , with its curved roofs and new shape , but it was not the same , and I had wanted to repeat something that was happy in my memory . There was a brass band , and a huge chorus . Cheers for the Queen boomed through the building , but this time it was not she , it was her Prince , who took my eye . " Papa , why is the Prince sad ? " We were driving home , and I was deflated . His answer made little sense to me : how could it to a child , and one who led such a life as mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this Crystal Palace business is stuff and nonsense . A Palace of Peace ! And here we are at war with the Russians already ! The man 's got his head in the clouds . A pity the Queen ever married him . She should have married some decent Englishman with his feet on the ground . I 'm told the feller 's always trying to stick his nose into state affairs . " He went on and on : about the war taxes which would ruin everybody , about twelve workmen who had been killed in the rebuilding of the Palace at Sydenham  --  " a warning , ' , ' ver there was one , " he said , but I could not see why  --  and it all passed over my head without meaning a thing . I knew only that a day from which I had expected much joy had turned gray and comfortless ; and the crown was put on it all when Mama greeted us in the hall , and he said : " Well , I hope young madam is satisfied with wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious things to be thought about , God knows . " With that , he stumped straight away to a room he used for working in at home . Mama , seeing me disconsolate , gave me one of her rare kisses and said : " We must excuse Papa . Just now he has so much on his mind , what with the war and one thing and another . " 2I say it made no sense to me at the time , that grumbling monologue as we drove home from Sydenham . But now that I look back upon it I find in it the seeds of the disaster that came upon my parents ' marriage . Papa had no use for a man with " his head in the clouds , " which meant to him , alas ! as to so many , a man who did n't have his heart in a ledger . " A decent Englishman with his feet on the ground " could tread no holier ground than Threadneedle Street and the region thereabout . I do n't suppose there is any reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did . He could have42left a lot to underlings . But he never learned the wisdom of the great Pierpont Morgan 's remark : " I can do a year 's work in nine months , but not in twelve . " He could have afforded a house in the country or by the sea , but he never had one . 1 le did not hunt or shoot or fish , and he disliked dancing . The occasions to which he took Mama out were City dinners and functions of that sort . Each summer he rented the same house at Broadstairs , and we went there for a fortnight . It seems to me to have been , for a man of his great wealth , an incredible life to lead . In its way , it was admirable : it had a stem rectitude according to its own lights . But I can not now recapture the surprise , the consternation , that assailed my young heart when I saw Mama lying on the sofa and Lord Burnage bending over her , kissing her hand. 3I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs . For a time , though , it was with Papa only : Mama remained in her bedroom . When at last she was able to rejoin us , things were not as they had been before . There never had been cordiality , but at least there had been a perfect decorum , a punctilious observance of rules that kept things moving sweetly . Now I was aware of a constant grittiness and even an occasional jolt . To give an example : there was a morning when the grapes upon the table looked especially tempting and I asked if I might have some . I knew that they had been sent by Lord Burnage . Ever since Mama 's accident he had been sending ' things : flowers and fruit and huge ribboned boxes of sweets like the one he had bought for me in Bond Street ; and every day he would appear in person at the door to ask how Mama was and to leave his greetings to her . Other people sent their footmen to inquire . Now when I asked Papa if he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at me in that maddening way he had of seeming to bring all his mental faculties to bear upon the simplest request , and said presently : " The grapes . . . Yes , the grapes . Well , Sarah , the grapes are not mine . They are your mother 's . She may or may not wish you to have some of them . But I imagine Lord Burnage intended them for her personal consumption . Would you not say so , Florence ? " Mama was reading a letter and did not answer . He pressed her : " Would you not say so , Florence ? These grapes , my dear . Sarah is asking if she may have some . Do you think Lord Burnage would like his favors to be shared ? Some men do n't . " Mama pushed the plate of grapes across the table to me , got up , and stood for a moment looking at him . I was amazed by that look. 43It was a glare , and there was loathing in it . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reading a letter . Mama walked out of the room . I felt that she would have flung out , as they say , but she was still a little lame . I was not asked to the breakfast room again that summer ; but on a day in early autumn Whaley was summoned to take breakfast with Papa . Mama was not present , and my own breakfast was served in the schoolroom , though I ate nothing , so shaken was I by a sense of crisis . I stood at the window , watching the familiar sights : the man sweeping up the yellow plane-tree leaves in the garden , the cabs and hansoms , the window-repair man with sheets of glass strapped to a frame on his back , the chimney sweep pushing his little cart loaded with gollywog-headed - brushes . They all moved by in the silent air under the pale blue autumn sky ; and then Papa 's hansom came to the curb , and I watched to see it start for the City . But it did not . It drove to Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was on the side of the square that ran at right angles to ours . Lord Burnage came out , so promptly that it seemed he must have been waiting . lle got into the hansom alongside Papa , and they drove away together . At that moment Miss Whale came into the schoolroom , looking very grave . She did not speak for some L. then she said : " How would you like to go away for a holiday , Sarah ? ' " But we 've had our holiday , " I cried , thinking of Broadstairs . " Yes , but it 's possible to have more than one holiday in a year . This will be a longer one . I do n't know how long . Sir Richard wishes me to take you away till  --  well , till we are recalled . " " But when do we go ? " " This afternoon . We shall travel to Folkestone today . Tomorrow we shall cross over to Boulogne . " 4But Boulogne was not our destination . Our destination was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on its hill above the swift rushing of the Candle . What a business it had been ! Never before in my life had I been so swept about , so lifted into a mounting transport of excitement . We had started to pack as soon as Whaley had said we were to be off , with me demanding all the time : Why ? Why ? Why ? Why are we going , Whaley ? Why are we going so suddenly , Whaley ? Why arc we going to France ? Whaley was reserved , and that was something new for her ; but I gathered that there were urgent reasons why I should be out of the way . " It was Sir Richard who suggested France , and when I spoke of the Undridges he thought that would be just the thing . Boulogne , 44after all , is almost within sight of England , and Montreuil is only a stone 's throw behind it . " " Who are the Undridges ? " " Do n't sit on that trunk . You 're hindering me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd better get them out of the shelves . The Undridges are people I used to know when I lived in France . I 've kept in touch with them , and they 're always urging me to come and stay with them at Montreuil . The school I was at was near there , and Mr. Undridge used to come in to give drawing lessons . He 's an artist . His wife took the English class . They have one little boy named Daniel . I suppose he 's about twelve now . " The morning passed in this excited sort of chattering , in scrambling packing , and in a scrambling luncheon . After that , Whaley took me to the drawing-room door and gently pushed me in . I was dressed for the journey , and already a hired four-wheeler cab was at the door and the trunks were being put on top of it . Mama was lying on a sofa , resting her leg . She reached out a hand as I approached and drew me to her . I had never seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , but now she was frozen . She kissed me very coldly . " Be a good child , " she said . " I have every confidence in Miss Whale . Remember that for some time now you will be entirely in her charge . You must give her strict obedience . " I said dutifully : " Yes , Mama , " and added impulsively : " Of course I will . I love Whaley . " She looked at me for a moment with sad speculation , and then said : " Well , that does n't always make life easier . " She seemed to be seeking something to say , something that ought to be said , but she could n't find it ; and as I stood there restlessly , moving from foot to foot , wishing for nothing but to be done with the moment and off on my adventure , so childishly unaware of the so much greater adventure before which she was poised and perhaps daunted , she said : " Very well , then ; off with you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last trunk going up on to the cab , I turned ungraciously enough and hurried off to join Whaley at the front door . After that it was a dazzle of new exciting experience that remains in my mind without cohesion or sequence : an experience of sailors and railwaymen , of sun glitter on a mid-Channel sea , of foreign chatter and foreign food , and Whaley cleaving her way through all this like a prow . I suppose even in those days getting to Montreuil was not much of an adventure ; but to my circumscribed young mind it seemed one of the first magnitude , and I drew such a breath of relief as a crusader might have done on reaching Jerusalem when Whaley put me into bed at the Hotel de France and said : " Well , we 've arrived . Tomorrow we shall look up the Undridges. " 455I am sorry to say that Daniel Undridge was wearing a suit of black velvet and a white lace collar . Even a woman of my age , who recalls such dress as customary , can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I myself was wearing I do not remember , and happilyno photograph survives to remind me . I can imagine pantaloons drooping to the tops of my boots , finishing off in a few inches of lace. it was afternoon  --  late afternoon  --  and I shall never forget it , not a moment of it : the very quality of the light seemed different from any I had known . There in the garden enclosed by high whitewashed walls it had almost a color , an autumn color , and the air was utterly still . We had been walking , Miss Whale and I , down a narrow cobbled street  --  a lane was all you could truly call it with long stretches of white wall on either hand , and here and there the butt end of a house . Miss Whale pushed open a little green door cut through a bigger door , and we went in and there was the house : low and white , glimmeri ' in the autumnal air that all day long had been warm and hazy and r. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insubstantial . It looked a haphazard house , a chalky oblong , with green trellis on the walls supporting jasmine and red roses . The scent of these flowers was in the air , heavy as though it had been accumulating there all summerlong between the high walls . A French window was open , and on the lawn in front of this the Undridges sat on green-painted iron chairs . " Whaley , tell me something about the Undridges , " I had demanded that morning , and Whaley , remembering as she did from time to time that to teach me French was part of her duty , replied with a laugh : " Onde , onduler , Undridge . La vraie fonction d'un Undridge est d'onduler . Which is to say , my clear Sarah , that an Undridge undu-lates . " The three Undridges rose as we approached , and flowed toward us . I saw at once what Whaley had meant . Mrs. Undridge was the most wavelike of the three , for her skirt made it possible to forget that she had legs . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the conception of the Pre-Raphaelites : tall , slender , a little goitrous , with a pale face out of which shone deep blue eyes . The lustrous silks that enveloped her rustled as she came toward me as though skating on invisible ice . One could see that Mr. Undridge had legs . They were encased in pepper-and-salt trousers . His black coat was loose and flowing ; the bow of broad black silk at his neck was loose and flowing ; the black sombrero , which he took from his head as he held Whaley 's hand , had been brooding a moment before like a small dark cloud upon his careless hair . He did not flow like a wave , as his wife46did , but like a leopard . His light eyes were curiously feral ; and his pointed beard and pointed nose seemed made for ferreting things out . The boy Daniel , as I have said , was in velvet and lace . He was slim and graceful , all flowing lines , and his long dark hair fell down one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were brushed every hour . Mr. Undridge brought two more green iron chairs and an iron table , and Mrs. Undridge flowed through the French windows and came out with the things for tea . I remember that all the words were uttered that would be uttered on such an occasion . " Now , have a real cup of tea , Maggie . " ( This was to Miss Whale . ) " I expect you 're dying for a real cup of tea . That 's one thing the French do n't even begin to understand  --  howto make a real cup of tea . " " But they beat us at coffee , " said Mr. Undridge . " Yes , " his wife conceded , " they can make a real cup of coffee , and we ca n't touch them at pastries . Daniel , manners ! The pastries for Miss Rainborough . " Daniel swiftly placed upon his plate the two most appealing of the pastries and handed me the dish with what was left , while his mother rattled on : " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't begin to understand them in England . " " The English do n't begin to understand wine , either , " said Mr. Undridge . " Oh , that ! " said Mrs. Undridge , and laughed a little silvery laugh which announced clearly enough that the English taste in wine was something which one indeed did not begin to understand . Whaley , sipping her tea , conceded that it was a real English cup , and inquired about Mr. Undridge 's work , his pictures . This , too , alas ! appeared to be something that the English did n't begin to understand . As they talked , Daniel sat and looked from one to another with his grave , almost adult face . From time to time his long thin hand would go up , scratching and ruffling in the wing of hair , and his mother would say : " Darling , your hair is so pretty . Do n't disarrange it . Have you not a comb ? " and Daniel would take a comb from his pocket and , still not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would draw it slowly through and through , sleeking the wing . In all this , I had been so much ignored that I was startled when Mrs. Undridge suddenly began : " Miss Rainborough  --  " " No one would object , " said Whaley , " if you called her Sarah . " " Well , Sarah , then . I expect you would like to look round the garden . Daniel , take Sarah to the pond . " I might have been a mare who was to be led off for a drink , or a puppy condemned to have a brick tied round its neck and to be hurled into the water , so abrupt was this command . Everybody got up . The47 " I think you 're a dreadful boy , " I said . This seemed to please him . He said : " I am  --  bloody dreadful . But they do n't know it . I 'm revolting . I could say things not fit for your ears . " I had nothing to say to that , and he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could muck up this blasted suit and say you did it . You 'd get into an awful row . " This , I thought , thinking of Mama , and the bowing , and the not bowing , is the sort of person one would " cut " in the Park ; but I did n't want to cut Daniel Undridge . I wanted to dare him . " You would n't do that , " I said . " I dare you . " He leaned down and thrust his hand into the pond and scooped a handful of green slime off its inner wall . I Ic slabbed it like a trowelful of mortar on to the front of his black velvet coat , and with both hands smeared it up and down till , what with his reeking hands and wild hair and filthy coat , he looked disgusting . He rubbed his slimy hands all over his face , and now indeed he looked as utterly revolting as he had claimed to be . He produced another of his celebrated grimaces , this time contriving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " now let him paint me sitting on the edge of the pond . I 'm sick of sitting on the edge of the blasted pond . " I looked at him in consternation . " You 're going to say that I did that to you ? " " Yes , " he said darkly . " I would n't like to be in your shoes . " He began to move toward the gap cut in the yew hedge , and now indeed I was troubled : not at what the Undridges would say : I did n't care a bit about that : but at what Whaley would think of me , for I did deeply value her good opinion . At this moment Whaley herself , moving unheard over the turf , appeared in the gap , and Daniel ran slap into her . She recoiled at the sight and threw up her hands . " Good gracious , Daniel ! Whatever have you been doing with yourself ? " Daniel hung his head , silent for a time , then pointed at me . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's horrid . She mucked me up . She smeared me all over . " Now I waited for Whaley 's wrath to strike me , but she only said : " Sit down for a moment , Daniel , " and he obediently sat on the warm stone edge of the pond . Whaley looked from one to the other of us , and then said : " You 're a bigger fool than I thought , Daniel . " " I 'm a blasted big boy , " he glowered , " and very intelligent . " " Yes , " said Whaley , " you 're so intelligent that you want me to believe that Sarah did this to you . You 're mucked up from head to foot , and she did it . Look at her . She did it without getting a spot of dirt on her clothes or a drop of water on her hands . Or has she had time to go in and take a bath and change ? " Daniel still glowered , but now had nothing to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stout , good-humored-looking creature , who began to clear away the tea things while Mr. and Mrs. lndridge and Whaley walked into the house . Daniel stood there at my side till everyone was gone . Then suddenly he gave a savage kick at the light iron table , sendingit sprawling , and with both hands worked madly at his hair till it stood on end in wild disorder all over his head . I ' roni under this disheveledthatch he made a grimace at me , and , seizing my hand , he said : " Now we 'll see the damned pond , if you want to . " We set off down a paved path between lawns , and as we went Daniel chanted , in a voice too low to be heard in the house , '  --  I'he damned pond , the blasted pond , the bloody pond , " looking sideways at me to see if I were shocked . I was : I had never heard such language beforeexcept in casual street snatches from the lips of cabbies and costers : but nothing would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words had any effect on me whatever . The pond was beautiful . It was circular , with a stone edge that was crusted with moss and lichens . Round this was paving , and then a flower bed , full now of late autumn color . Outsi e this again was a hedge of clipped yew . It was a magic enclosure , cret , bloomy with dusk , cool with the drip of water over the edge of t I asin . " Well , " said Daniel , " here 's the blasted pond . How do you like it ? " Now this was the first time I had ever been alone with a boy . It was not often that I had been alone with anybody , except first Kite and then Whaley . Sometimes I was taken to parties where boys were present , and there were boys at the dancing classes . But they were sad and repressed little boys . This was something altogether different and I thought : If this is what boys are like when they are left on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a boy again . Daniel stood looking down into the Itond , his bands in his pockets , his toe detaching from the stone rim a bright orange disc of lichen . " Why do you swear ? " I asked righteously . He did n't answer , but went on industriously hacking at the lichen . " It takes years for those things to grow , " he said . " It was very pretty , and now you 've destroyed it . " " He thinks they 're wonderful . ' Do n't you think this patina of lichen is really rather remarkable ? It 's such accidental beauties that move the heart more than all our contrived effects . ' " I realized that he was mimicking his father . " Do n't you like your Papa ? " I asked . Again he did not answer , but , thrusting his ten fingers violently into his hair he heaved it about till it looked like a wrecked cornstook . He turned round and made a dreadful face at me , pulling down the skin round his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting out his tongue . " How 's that for an accidental beauty ? " he demanded. 48 49Miss Whale , " what are you going to tell your father and mother ? You 'll have to explain yourself somehow . Wo n't you ? " " S'posc so , " said Daniel , now completely miserable . " Well , " Whale demanded briskly . " Have you got any ideas ? " But the deflated Daniel had none . I thought that in another moment he would begin to whimper . " We could say he fell into the pond , " I offered , and now he shot me a look almost of gratitude ; but Whaley came down coldly : " He looks awful , but he does n't look bad enough for that . If he 's going to say he 's been in the pond , then he 'll have to go into the pond . And as I see nothing else for it , iii he goes . " With that , she put a foot under his knees , gave a heave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him by the scruff of the neck , and had him out almost as soon as he was in . " Now , " said Whaley as Daniel stood there dripping dismally , " any explaining that 's to be done you can do for yourself . You got into the mess , and we 've done our best to get you out . I 've said au revoir for Sarah to your parents , and now we 're off . A dernain . " With that , she took me by the hand and off we marched , past the house where a pale light or two was appearing on the chalky face , through the green door into the cobbled lane , and so across the Grande Place to the Hotel de France , where , but not till then , Whaley exploded briefly : " The little horror ! " 6The Hotel de France was set back in a little bay off the Place , and it had a balconied courtyard . It was delightful to leap out of bed and run onto the balcony and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incense of coffee and new bread . After breakfast we wandered into the Place where old countrywomen had set up their stalls beneath the trees , and the autumn sun shone on apples and pears , cabbages , onions , carrots , all sorts of things that composed themselves into a score of glowing pictures , and there was a chatter of conversation unintelligible to me , and a squawking and quacking of hens and ducks , and rough ponies that had drawn the country carts were tied to the trees . The Undridge 's Berthe , with a big wicker basket on either arm , was chaffering and haggling from stall to stall , and Whaley said : " She 'll think it a great triumph if the complete morning 's shopping gets done at two sous less than she 's asked . " I had forgotten the Undridges , so charmed was I by the autumn morning that smelled of dewy cobwebs and by the shifting colored scene , but Berthe recalled them to my mind , and I asked : " Why do the Undridges live in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can please themselves where50they live , ca n't they ? They like France . For one thing , they 're not well off and they find it a cheap place to live in , and for another they were not happy in England . " " Why were they not happy ? " I persisted , and Whaley said : " Oh , there were many reasons . Have you ever heard of Dante Gabriel Rossetti ? " I had n't , and Whaley was too sensible to confuse my mind with a lot of names and " movements " which would have meant nothing to me then . " Mr. Undridge quarreled with him , " she said . " There was a lot of unpleasantness one way and another , and the Undridges cleared out . " It all came to me bit by bit later on , and it was simple enough , Rossetti being what he was and Mr. Undridge what he was . They were very sure of themselves , those young Pre-Raphaelite painters , happy in rebellion , rejoicing in being contumeliously spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that set , hobnobbing with Millais and Rossetti , Ford Madox Brown and all the others . his wife had been a model for most of them . She had been the mother of Jesus and a beggar maid , a Greek girl holding a pitcher on her head and a big-eyed emigrantlooking her last on England . But Undridge was not as good a painter as the rest : in fact , he was not a good painter at all . Rossetti tolerated him so long as he was safe for a pound now and a fiver later on ; but Undridge was a poor man , and the first row came when he refused to lend Rossetti any more money . Thereupon , in the presence of Millais , Rossetti told him what he thought of his pictures , and slapped him across the face with a smoked herring . And this was the absurd reason why the Undridges had for years now been living in France . There , nourishing his injured self-esteem , Francis Undridge became more self-consciously a " painter " than ever , in dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only too eager to ploy up to him , and Daniel had to . Francis painted one picture that became widely known . It was of the pond in the garden at Montreuil . Daniel , in black velvet and lace , his wing of hair immaculate , sat on the pond 's edge , gazing at his image in the water . The picture was called " Reflection , " and it was bought by a firm of brass-polish manufacturers . It was to be seen on every hoarding throughout a few decades , inscribed : " For perfect Reflections use Easyrub Metal Polish . " Thereafter , poor Daniel was painted again and again , in many poses , on the edge of the pond ; and if I had had any adult sense of all this on that afternoon of our first meeting I should not , I suppose , have thought him such a terrible little boy. 7 " I thought we were going to live with the Undridges , " I said to Whaley as we watched Berthe moving off with her loaded baskets. 51 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall live in the Undridges ' house , but they wo n't be there . " There was none of this nonsense about passports and papers and money-changing and all the rest of it in those days . Miss Whale had discussed with Papa what was best to be done with me in a moment of crisis . She had remembered the Undridges . They were always hard up , they would be glad to have paying guests ; and so , that very same day off we had gone . But during the talk in the drawing room , while Daniel was acting like an idiot child by the pond , she learned that our unheraldedarrival had come at a moment when the Undridges were themselves poised for flight . Mr. Undridge had accepted the direction of English studies in a school at Bordeaux and would be off in a day or two . However , his lease of this house in Montrcuil did not expire until the coming spring , and if Miss Whale and I cared to live there , that would put a bit of rent into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Daniel could stay there , too , that would be most convenient to the Undridges while they were finding their feet in Bordeaux . It remained now only for Whaley to communicate all this to Papa . I lis consent came promptly . Poor man ! Little I knew what bitter business was occupying his mind and how pleased he was to fall in with any scheme that kept me out of the way and in good hands . And so within a week the Undridges went , we left the attractive balcony rooms in the Hotel de France , and Miss Whale and I settled down with Berthe and Daniel in the long white house . We stayed there throughout the autumn and winter and far into the next spring , but I must not delay in recollection of that happy time . For me and Daniel , it was such a time as we had not known before . We were both released from trammels ; we lived so democratic a life that I am sure Papa and Mama would have been horrified had they known about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a servant  --  not a governess , to whom certain privileges were accorded , nut a kitchen servant  --  was admitted to our companionship . We wandered everywhere together , the four of us , and as autumn gave place to winter those wanderings were especially lovely . Round the ram lea rt s of the little town , down into the flat marsh country through which the Candle flowed , into cottages where we bought cider and into wayside pubs where we sat on benches and watched our eggs and potatoes frying on the stove , flower-pot shaped , with one little red glowing eye . Daniel and I were allowed to sip the rough hot red wine that Whaley and Berthe drank from tumblerswith their eggs and chips and slices of coarse bread cut from loaves shaped like batons . There would be farmers and agricultural laborers sitting around , smoking and spitting , and talking the lingo that I never was any good at ; and then there would be the walk home along the poplar-bordered roads , sometimes with the moon rising , sometimes withfrost making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to our own fireside and the hanging lamp , and Berthe knitting in a corner , Whaley writing at a little desk , and Daniel and I bent over a book under the light . How reasonable a little boy he seemed now ! He wore old clothes and brushed his hair when he felt like it , not that there was now much of it to bother about , for he had celebrated his parents ' departure by giving himself the crop of his life . But he did n't swear or pull faces . All through that time Miss Whale gave me nothing that could be called a lesson , but I see now that her educational system was in full swing , and that , as I had so little time to spend in France , she was determined that I should see and know the bit of France I was in rather than sit and listen to rigmaroles about France . But she said nothing of this to me , and all too soon the morning came when she announced : " Well , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we can settle things here . " It was a lovely May morning , the first on which we had breakfasted out of doors . We were sitting at one of the little green iron tables , very quietly , so as not to disturb the chaffinches that were hopping after crumbs thrown on the path . And there Whaley sat , holding the letter in her hand as she made this announcement , and I saw with a flutter of the heart that the envelope was of a kind I knew . " Is the letter from Lord Burnage ? " I asked . Daniel had gone into the house . She and I were alone . She looked at me for some time without speaking , weighingthe letter in her hand , and then said : " No , Sarah , it is not from Lord Burnage . It is from Lady Burnage . That is , your Mama . She and Lord Burnage are now married . " CHAPTER FIVEII CAN NOT say much about my sensations on hearing the news that Miss Whale had given me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been Lady Rainborough , had now become Lady Burnage was something I had to accept as best I could . Even Whaley did not venture to explain to a ten-year-old child of those times what was meant by divorce . But here I may as well say something of what I gradually learned as the years passed , and so have done with the matter . Lord Burnage was twice involved in divorce cases , first as what we call the aggrieved party , when his wife left him for the Duke of Fallowshire , and then as the offending party , when he met my mother . 1 must even write the strange phrase , which sounds like something outof a Ouida novel , that he resigned from his regiment , but in those days men did such things for such reasons . Also , Lord Bumage never again sat in the House of Lords . So the affair had a considerable effect upon his life , and no less upon the life of my father . He must have had some generous feelings , for there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he could have had " the custody of the child , " and when I read that old cliche and realize , withered wretch that I now am , that I was the child in question , I am forever grateful that he let me go . Still , without wishing to diminish him , I must recognize that the chances are he was acting in the way he found most convenient to himself . He never had been a " family man . " His business affairs absorbed him wholly , and to have the custodyof a child while deprived of the companionship of a wife no doubt seemed to him nothing but an expensive shackle . Anyway , he left the house in Porturan Square and set himself up in Albany with a manservant . Let me not end this note upon him with a disparaging twist . He could , out of spite , have separated me from my mother , and he did not do so . He was never a man to lift up the heart , but he seems , in this , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so much for those tedious and dolorous details . They did not affect me then . All I realized was that a strange heart-stirring thing had happened . Mama was Lord Burnage 's wife and I would live with them and Sally Gaylord . " Wo n't you love it ? " I cried to Whaley , and she answered soberly : " I ? What has it to do with me ? " " But you will be there ! You will be with us all at Tresant . " " That remains to be seen , " said Whaley . " No doubt Miss Gaylord has her own governess and perhaps you 'll share . " It was a cloud over the morning . I was glum and not easy to be comforted . " Cheer up , Sarah , " Whaley cried . " After all , I 've got to leave you some day . " " I know that , " I said . " But that slhould n't he till my character is formed . I heard Papa say so to Manta . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you 've done that , I shall be strong enough to do without you , and you can go . " " Yes , " Whaley answered . " That 's a joyful thing for me to look forward to , is n't it ? " 2I was sorry to leave Daniel Undridge . his parents had been written to and told that Whaley and I would he leaving Montreuil any day , and Mr. Undridge had replied that Daniel should remain with Berthe until he could himself come to take him to Bordeaux . Almost a week had passed , and we still awaited instructions about the journey to54'I'resant , and then a gloriously unexpected thing happened . Lord Burnageand Sally Gaylord stooped through our little wicket gate and were among us as we sat at tea ! They had come to take us home . From that moment Daniel 's conduct made me ashamed . I had felt so proud of his improved manners that it was a shock to find he had n't a word to say to our visitors . They sat down at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured out the tea . There was such a chatter as you may imagine as Lord Burnage outlined the plans for our journey : a chatter from everybody except Daniel . He sat and glowered . " And how does this young man feel about his journey to Bordeaux ? " Lord Burnage asked , for we had told him of Daniel 's coming departure . Daniel frowned darkly , ruffled his hair which had begun to grow again , and answered : " Je ne corn prends pas l'Anglais . " " Eh Bien , " said Lord Burnage . " Parlous alors en Francais . Ce voyage it Bordeaux . Vous serez content , sans doute , de revoir vos parents ? " " I do n't understand French , " Daniel replied . Whaley was shocked and said : " Daniel , would you like to take Miss Gaylord to see the pond ? " I leapt up in alarm . " I 'll take her , " I said , and as we went , Daniel got up and followed us . He followed us all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he lagged a few yards behind , and when Sally and I stood looking down at the water that was waking up like everything else into spring life , he remained , removed from us , his hands in his pockets , his shoe kicking sulkily at a stone . Sally turned round and looked at him . " What 's the matter with you ? " she demanded sharply. hen , indeed , Daniel put the last touch to my shame and horror . He raised his head , looked Sally straight in the face , and said : " Mind your own bloody business . " I expected Sally to be shocked , but she only laughed . " Well , " she said , " he 's human at least . He talks like a stableboy . " Daniel 's reply was what I expected . He fluffed up his hair , put out his tongue , and made a frightful face . Sally laughed again . " I could do that , " she said . " But I sha n't . I think one looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of a word out of his own forbidden repertory shook Daniel and left him defenseless . Seeing this , Sally said imperiously : " Come here , boy . No one 's going to eat you . " I'hen Daniel shuffled up and stood between us , looking down at the poi d . Sally put her arm through his and said nothing , but I could feel ,  --  . t , ioolint apart though we were , that Daniel was becoming quiet and urnIt , ' nt . We remained there for a time , watching the light sparkle on the water , listening to the splash from the little fountain into the basin unr3 lean the brimming basin 's edge into the pond . We did n't speak a tlo , l. word till Sally at last said : " Well , now we 've seen the pond , as55ordered . Let us go back . " She unhooked Daniel 's arm and we all walked back to the house . Many , many years later I was to remember that small strange incident , that power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; though then , with so much else , the direction of the surprising career that was to be hers was hidden from me. 3I remember many odds and ends out of those last days we spent in Montreuil . Whaley at lunch in the Hotel de France , where Lord Bumage and Sally were staying , beginning anxiously : " It would be a convenience , my lord , if my engagement to look after Miss Rainboroughis to end , if I could know promptly whether . . . " and Lord Burnage'slaugh as he answered : " It has never been our tradition , Miss Whale , to throw people into the streets . " Our tradition . . . It sounded splendid . I liked it . A book that I have still of beautiful parchment writing-paper , bound in blue leather , with my name in gold on the cover . " 1 expect , my dear , " said Lord Burnage , " you will want to keep a record of the journey we are about to make . Here 's a book for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls on the Grande Place that morning when we set out . Trunks were being piled on top of a huge rollicking old coach that Lord Burnage had hired from Boulogne , with two horses to pull it . Lord Burnage preferred to ride . He came out of the hotel , slapping his leg with his crop . Daniel pulled off his cap , and Lord Burnage , towering above him , tapped him familiarly on the shoulder with the crop . " You 're a good boy , " he said , " but you must learn to know it . Do n't think the whole world is trying to get you down . Can you remember that ? " " Yes , sir . " " Very well . Good-by now . Perhaps we shall meet again . " They shook hands , and I saw a gold coin slipped from palm to palm and Daniel 's look of astonishment . There was a little gold brooch for Berthe , and then , as everything was ready and the riding horse was led up , Lord Burnage said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the girls . You can kiss ' em if you like . " So Sally and I were saluted by Daniel , not with a kiss but with a pressure of cheek to cheek , first on one side , then the other , in the French fashion . And then we climbed into the coach , where Whaley had already taken her place , Lord Bumage mounted his horse , and off we went amid the excited brouhaha of the market people who did not every day see an English lord setting out from the Hotel de France . Off we went , through the octroi barrier , down the long straight , tree-56bordered road that we had so often followed to the Cafe de 1'Agricultureand our feasts of chips and sips of hot red wine , southward , as my blue book tells me , though little enough I wrote in it then save names , to Abbeville , Amiens and Paris , and westward to Chartres , Le Mans , Rennes and Brest . It was the ending of a wonderful time . It is all so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue book does not help much . Not even dates are in it . But though it is not written in the book , it is written in me , and nothing but death can cross it out . I am old and tired and lonely . They are all dead now , those who bowled with me then along the roads of France ; but in this bitter and so different day I still occasionally start out of a doze in which once more I am a child in a beautiful world , and the coach is rolling into Brest , and Sally , leaning out of the window , is shouting to Lord Bumage , who is riding ahead : " Papa ! Papa ! There 's Captain Rodda ! " 4Lord Bumage had not seen Captain Rodda , nor had he heard Sally 's cry . he went on at a sedate jog trot down the street , and I saw the captain break into a run and follow him . It was something to see Eddy Rodda running . He was a mountain of a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his great size was splendidly proportioned . His dark blue trousers were tucked into leather boots that came above his knees . A dark blue jersey clothed his vast torso , and on his head was a knitted cap in rings of red and white . The top of it was finished off in a red tassel that dangled down his cheek . Seeing him even as I did then , with his back to me and on the run , I was aware of his black beard , for it was long and fine and blew behind him . It was not till we met later face to face that I saw the wild blue of his eyes and the buzzard beak . When we got out of the coach at our hotel , Lord l ; urnage 's horse was already being led away , and he and Captain Rodda stood together , talking . I had always thought of Lord Burnage as a tall man , but now he looked small . Rodda overtopped him by inches and was in every way built on bigger lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed , were like sledge hammers , and all about him the air was filled with a pungent smell from the fish oil that kept his big boots , , apple . There was another smell about him which I did not recognize . I le had been waiting for Lord Bumage for some days , and there had ! wen nothing for him to do , for his boat , the Sally Gaylord , was at moorings , with his son , Wesley Rodda , aboard . It was dangerous for ( ' . II tain Rodda to have nothing to do , and the odor that mingled with the fish oil was of red wine , cognac , and any other drink that he had IK n able to come by . Something of the geniality that this had imparted57was in the grin of welcome that he turned upon Sally . It set his white teeth flashing out of the ambush of his beard . He looked like a corsair in a good mood that could not be trusted to last . His huge hand engulfedthe one she at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he exclaimed . " The little ole boat 's ready any time you are . " 5The next morning Whaley and I sat on one of the Brest quays watchingWesley Rodda take the luggage aboard the Sally Gaylord . The trunks had all been dumped down there on the quay ; the ship lay at moorings out in the harbor ; and Wesley sculled from her to the land , standing up in the dinghy , and then , with a bit more luggage , would row back and put the stuff aboard . Occasionally he would smile shyly at me and Whaley , but he had nothing of his father 's geniality . Or of his father 's physique . He was , I suppose , about twenty years old then , small , clean-shaved , and rather pale . There was an almost effeminate wistful beauty about his face , and he had a clear tenor voice which that morning he would raise in song as soon as he was away from us and out on the water . He sang : What shall we offer our good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fain would we His great name record , And worthily set forth His praise . It went to a good tune , and Whaley sang it , too . As Wesley drew near for the third or fourth time she said to him : " I like those Methodist hymns . " " Ay , " said the young man quietly . " ' That one 's by Spangenberg , translated by John Wesley . " " I did n't know that . But I like it , and I like the tune . My father was a local preacher . " " So 's mine , " said Wesley surprisingly . " But it was Mother wanted me called Wesley . " He seemed to feel he had said enough , humped another couple of trunks down to the dinghy , and rowed away singing : O Thou who camest from above The pure celestial fire to impart , Kindle a flame of sacred love On the mean altar of my heart. 58He was dressed like his father , save that he had not a dramatic and self-conscious cap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no added ingredient of alcohol . The sun shone . The well-tended blue dinghy moved sweetly over the calm harbor water . The gulls were swooping and calling , and Whaley said : " It will all be very strange for you , Sarah , but I think you 'll be in a happy place . " I had given little enough thought to the sort of place it was to be . Day by day , ever since our hurried departure to Folkestone , I had taken the hours as they came , especially the magical hours of this journey now ended on the quays of Brest . " It will be strange , " I said to Whaley now , " to see boats instead of cabs and men like Captain Rodda instead of chimney sweeps . " " Do n't expect , " she answered , " to see too many men like him . I imagine he 's not the sort of man you 'll find in great numbers anywhere . It would be rather overpowering if he were . " There was only one trunk left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wesley was once more sculling in to the stone steps above which we were sitting , when Captain Rodda came strolling along with two French girls , one hanging onto either arm . I am sure this was one of those moments when Mercy Kite would have whisked me out of sight , to some place where I was " safe , " and the world 's contagion could not touch me . Nor would Mama , whom I could not think of as Lady Burnage , have approved my witnessing this scene , common enough though it was in any port . But Whaley stayed where she was . There was a small square stone-built hut with a slate roof and a couple of life belts hanging to the outer walls and a rough bench where one could sit , leaning back against the stone . There we were , on this bench , and there we stayed , as Captain Rodda and his girls approached , he talking in his loud voice with many " midears " and with many squeezings of their arms to his sides , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wesley had tied the dinghy and come up the steps . Ile stood near us , watching his father approach , and I could feel his shame that we should witness this scene . He was blushing hotly , and to hide his confusion he turned to the great leather trunk that was too much for his strength . " Leave it ! Leave it ! " Captain Rodda bellowed : and disengaging himself from the girls he gave each a resounding kiss and a hearty slap on the bottom and shouted : " Off with you now , midears ! " But they stood about , crying , " Monny ! Monny ! " The captain was not to be moved . He had done with them , and that was that . " Mlle : ! " he roared . " No more monny . Trez greedy . Allez ! " and seeing us sitting there he gave us a wink that invited us to admire his skill in kindling a situation of this sort . Wesley was still fiddling with the tnutk , so that he might hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain ISc dda ordered , and advancing upon it , he picked it up in his great59 hands , swung it to his shoulder , and walked down the steps to the boat . It was he who took the oars that looked immense to me but to him seemed feather-light . " Now , Wesley boy , " he shouted as the boat skimmed over the water , " what about a good ole hymn ? What about 0 for a heart . . . ? " And over the sparkling water of Brest harbor we heard , what we were so often to hear , Eddy Rodda 's voice raised in sacred song . It was moving and magnificent : 0 for a heart to praise my God , A heart from sin set free , A heart that always feels Thy blood So freely spilt for me . The sun shone on the blue dinghy and sparkled on the oared water . It lit him up , woolen tasseled cap , great beard , and massive chest from which the shoulders made child 's play of the oars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifting our hearts , with Wesley 's tenor threading a grace through it . The Sally Gaylord was not far out : they were still singing as they climbed aboard ; and leaning on the bulwarks they attacked the last verse : Thy nature , gracious Lord , impart ; Come quickly from above , Write Thy new name upon my heart , Thy new , best name of Love . Then they stood for a moment side by side looking over the water , before Captain Rodda slapped his son on the shoulder and shouted : " Praise the Lord , me ole lover . Forget not all His benefits , " swung down into the dinghy and threw the trunk aboard like a draper 's parcel . 6 It was like Lord Burnage to have arranged that we should go home by sea and that Captain Rodda should be at Brest to meet us . Even Sally had n't known that this was to happen . But he liked to arrange charming and surprising occasions , though , of course , this could have been anything but charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect in a rough little working boat : experience had taught them that it would take a lot to make them sick ; but we others were without any knowledge of the sea , save for my one cross-Channel journey and two or three that Whaley had made . And these had been in ships built for the purpose , not in such pitifully small craft as the Sally Gay- 6o lord appeared to our unaccustomed eyes . However , there we were , embarked , and the boat riding merrily beneath us , lying over on her side in what seemed to me at first a dangerous and desperate fashion . But by the end of an hour this became normal , and also it became clear that if nothing worse than this happened we were not going to be sick . The wind was light but steady . We sailed due west for a couple of hours , and then she was put around to the north . " She 's heading straight for Cornwall now , " Sally said , " straight for Tresant . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the sailing lights rigged as the red west darkened and the dark east went black , and the stars came out . Captain Rodda handed the tiller to Lord Burnage and went into the cabin to brew tea for our last meal of the day . All we needed to eat had been brought aboard at Brest in a hamper . We went into the cabin to eat , leaving Wesley in the cockpit , and then there was some argument about our dispositions for the night . There were two berths in the cabin , and Lord Burnage wanted me and Whaley to sleep in them , but I had no wish to sleep at all . I had never sat up all night , and it seemed to me that this would be a fine chance to do so . Lord Burnage humored me , while swearing that I would sleep where I sat ; and so at about ten o'clock Whaley and Sally turned in . I took my place on the cockpit seat beside Wesley , and Lord Burnage and CaptainRodda , rolling themselves in blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . I , too , had a blanket wrapped round me . It was dark and cold . Forward , a vertical slit of light where the cabin door had not been completely slid to . Overhead , the sway of the mast across the stars . All around , the kiss and lisp and crisp whisper of water hissing by . Almost at my feet , the dark huddle of the two men on the deck , with presently a loud snoring from Captain Rodda , and from Lord Burnage a persistent muted snore like a cat 's purring . " So you be goin ' to live at Tresant , " Wesley suddenly spoke softly . The quiet and the darkness made me answer on the same low conspiringnote . " Yes . Lord Burnage is my new Papa . " " Tidd'n sense to talk like that , " said Wesley with deep conviction . " Our Father which art in Heaven don ' give us more'n one father here below . Not but what his lordship was in a sore situation . Her ladyship hated Tresant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didd'n like our wild ways hereabouts an ' the roarin ' o ' wind an ' sea in winter . An ' so ' er could n't get along with ' e . That 's the bottom of it , midear , an ' a sore situation it was , as everybody knowed long afore they parted . I 've see 'd your mother , her new ladyship , an ' a beautiful woman she be , but as fer you having a new papa I don " old wi ' that , an ' I don ' see God 's blessin ' on it . " There was nothing I could say . It was cold and dark , and Wesley , with one arm draped over the tiller , held me with the other close against 6ihis warmth . The his and lisp of the hidden water went by , and far away the lights of ; u , other ship looked very lonely . " I 've played ( ; od 's blessin ' on it , " said Wesley , " but ' e do give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One flesh . That 's the word of the Lord , an ' that do make divorce an abomination . Yet his lordship is not a son of Bch , ' 1 . I Ic do feed the hungry an ' help the oppressed . Very confusin ' , Miss , this world be to me . " A sigh came from him , a perplexed and weary sigh . Captain Rodda rolled over with a grunt , settled down , and snored again . " Very confusin ' , " said Wesley , " the mixture there be in men , wi ' God holdin ' their right hand an ' the Devil their left . There be my father , rollin ' now in sleep , as I 've seen ' im rollin ' in drink , an ' yet I 've ' card ' im powerful in prayer an ' liftin ' the heart wi " is discourse . An ' us ca n't ' elp lovin ' ' e , my mother an ' I , as if ' e was the truest man God ever made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . There 's no fathomin ' it , midear . There 's no knowin ' what our heavenly Father 's up to when ' E makes a man . " Should I have hated him ? Much that he said meant nothing . Divorce was a word that had no clear sense for me , and I had never , anyhow , associated it with Mama and Lord Burnage . All I knew was that she was his new wife , that he was my new Papa , and this had seemed to me a happy state of things . Yet here , in the dark and the cold  --  it was becoming very cold  --  with the sea that had been sparkling all day now black , mysterious , menacing , I was hearing that somehow something abominable had happened , something on which God 's blessingcould not fall . Should I have hated him ? Anyway , I did not . The happy and wonderful resilience of childhood let it all drift off my mind , and I was conscious of little save his arm around me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him . Soon I was asleep , a sleep in which I felt the cold and heard the slap of water , and knew the comfort and safety that his presence gave mc . I woke with a start , as a dash of cold water struck my face . The wind had freshened and had thrown a spatter of sea inboard . There was still an arm about me , but so soundly had 1 slept that I only now perceived that this was Captain Rodda 's arm , not Wesley 's . " Well , midear , " he said , " you been ' aving forty winks . " I liked the comforting feel of his arm , the rumble of his voice . I drew my blanket closer about me and snuggled into him . The sails were deepbelliedin the lively wind ; the water soughed past us urgently . " " So you be ' er new ladyship 's lil ' daughter ? " said Captain Rodda , and I hoped I was not going to hear anything more about divorce and abomination and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety . " Well , a blessin ' it be , I reckon , for his lordship . ' Er never belonged to be in a place like this , that other one as wanted to walk the6awoods in a golden gown . All very well that be for the streets of paradise when we get our ' arps and crowns , but Porteven 's not paradise , though I would n't change the one for the other . You 'll see , midear , when you get there , an ' that wo n't be long wi ' this lively lil ' wind . Just a few houses it be , an ' a stink o ' fish , an ' tannin ' when the new nets spread to dry , an ' gorse forever bloomin ' on the cliffs . When gorse is out o ' season kissin 's out o ' reason , they do say , an ' thank God there 's gorse all the year round . " He chuckled , and said : " God 's blessin 's on it , midear , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine man like his lordship denied a second chance . " I still could not  --  well , I suppose I must use the modem word and say " condition " myself to hearing the " lower classes " discussing so freely , and with me myself , those who belonged to my class . So I said abruptly : " I think this is a lovely ship you have , Captain Rodda . " " She ai n't mine , me ole dear , " he said , " she 's his lordship 's . But she 's mine an ' Wesley 's as much as makes no diff'rence . All trim she be now , but you should see ' er when we 're after pilchards . Up to our knees they be , flappin ' an ' gaspin ' , an ' still the nets comin ' in fit to bust . There 's times , as now , when his lordship wants ' er , but she 's a workin ' girl is this li'l ship most o ' the year ' round . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boots even upon that sharp wind-cleaned air , and now he took a flask from his pocket and swigged , and I caught the other smell that was characteristic of him . " That 's a comfort , " he said , smacking his lips , " and it 's a comfort , too , to have the warrant of the Apostle to the Gentiles . Be no longer a drinker of water but use a little wine for thy stomach 's sake , ' he says to son Timothy , an ' I reckon a mouthful o ' brandy can go in as included in the reckonin ' . " " Tell me about Tresant , " I said . " No . I didn ' ought to do that . Tresant 's his lordship 's affair an ' he 'll want to tell you ' isself . You tell me something . What 's ' that boy Wesley been sayin ' to you ? " Now here was a facer that I could do nothing with . Divorce and damnation and father rolling drunk in the gutter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He says you 're a local preacher . What 's a local preacher ? " He cocked an eye up at the sails , tightened a sheet , and settled himselfagain comfortably . " Well , that 's goin ' into history , midear . Ole John Wesley was a powerful man of God , an ' he converted so many souls he didn ' know what to do wi " em . There they 'd be , over in Gwennap Pit and other places round about , crowded in so deep they 'd be like pilchards in this63boat when we 'd lead a good haul . And there olc John 'd be , upon the edge of the I ii , 1 n kin ' down on all those poor sinners crowded beneathlike as if lie might be perched up there on the gun'le of this boat , lookin ' clown on the pilchards . A mighty rider ' e was , goin ' everywhere on his olc nag , and tlhc mobs with stones an ' dead tomcats an ' the magistrateswi ' warrants couldn ' stop ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of England to another , a reg'lar angel on horseback . Well , ' c comes , let us say , to the edge of this ole pit an ' looks down on all them sinners , and they looks up at ' im , standin ' up against the sky . There ' c is , ole John , just come off his horse , an ' wearin ' white bands under ' is collar , an ' a Bible under ' is arm , and his white hair shinin ' . Like a gleamin ' apparition'e must 've been to all them ole sinners down in the pit . Then ' e begins to speak , and maybe ' e says : Let 's begin now wi ' one of my brother Charles 's li ' 1 ole hymns . ' Maybe it 's Depth of Mercy ' : Depth of mercy ! Can there be Mercy still reserved for me ? Can my God His wrath forbear ? Me , the chief of sinners , spare ? " Now up this comes out of the pit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymn , and John stands there lookin ' down at that pitful of sinners and knows ' e 's got ' em in the ' ollow of ' is ' and . All that singin ' comes floatin ' up to ' im , an ' they 're singin ' well , because if you 're not a great saint it 's something to think you 're the chief of sinners , even if you 're not that by a long chalk , because a man likes to think ' e 's something special one way or the other , even when you could n't tell ' im from his next-door neighbor any more than you could tell one rib from another in the backbone of a pilchard . So thinkin ' of their terrible sins , which not one in a hundred of ' cm ' ud ever commit , they begin to weep an ' choke and think God could never ' ave mercy on the likes o ' we , monumentalsinners as we are , ' and ole John is pleased an ' thinks again : ' Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' ollow of my ' and . ' Then he prays God to spare these terrible sinners , an ' down in that ole pit there 's silence , broken only by a groan or a cry an ' p'raps in the mornin ' air the whinnyin ' of John 's ole nag , tied to a post somewhere , a faithful servant of the Lord if ever there was one . Well , then John ' olds up ' is ' and , an ' a great silence comes as they all look up at him standin ' above ' em on the edge of the pit , an ' p'raps the sun strikes through a cloud and light comes round him , so that he looks like a bein ' lit up by the light of God . " Ay , me ole lover , I 've stood in that li'l pit on a spring morning an ' I 've seen it all like that . No one ' ud be surprised to see angels come slidin ' down that beam of light that lies tender on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callin ' , an ' when the curlews call ' t is like as if64you ' eard the sound of souls bound in love to this ole earth , yet longin ' for release into the love o ' God . Terrible wistful they be , the curlews . You 'll ' ear ' em plenty at Tresant , but upalong I reckon you do n't know what they are . " Well , ole John begins to preach an ' pours the brimstone of I-Iell down into that pit . They listen in terror , an ' they shout an ' groan an ' cry . They throw themselves on the ground and they writhe and wriggle as if already they felt ole Nick 's fork takin ' a purchase between their shoulder blades . An ' then there 's mercy . John 's voice changes . He 's layin ' balm on their burns , the balm of the Love o ' God . ' E 's showin " em the signpost , an ' that there 's an arm pointin ' to IIeaven as well as one pointin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ' em to make the great decision , and Alleluiahs an ' Praise the Lords rise up out of the pit . Cries of joy , me ole lover , instead of groans of despair . There 's a great harvest for ole John , the fisher of men . The nets break . But off ' e must go . The nag 's waitin ' an ' the world 's his parish , an ' off he must go . Like ole Paul , he was . And when itcame to pass that we were parted from them and had set sail we came with a straight course unto Cos , and the next day unto Rhodes , and from thence into Patara ; and having found a ship crossing over into Phoenicia we went aboard and set sail . And when we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left hand , we sailed into Syria and landed at Tyre . ' " That 's how it was with Paul , ding-dongin ' about the Mediterranean in search of souls , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed in one land and used a nag instead of a ship . But for both of ' em there was the same problem , and that was finding them as ' ud look after the souls they saved . An ' they solved it in the same way , midear . There could n't be paid parsons ' ere , there an ' everywhere ; so when all the men an ' women who found God began to build chapels to worship Him in , they ' ad to put up with their own mates for preachin ' an ' expoundin ' the Word . An ' that 's what local preachers are , midear , to this day . There 's no paid parson in Porteven , but Wesley an ' I an ' one or two others carry on the work o ' the Lord . " " Thank you , Captain Rodda , " I said , feeling this to be a terse and inadequate reply to his oration . " Now you go to sleep , " he commanded . " Tomorrow all things will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there an ' seein ' this an ' that , an ' that do wear you out body an ' soul , so it do . " He pulled me closer into his side , and I was ready enough to go to sleep . The motion of the boat , the cold touch of the wind , the sound of the sea sliding alongside , all drowsed me and I shut my eyes . I always liked , when I settled down to sleep , to take hold of some thing or some words for my thoughts to move around , and now I took hold of this : " Tomorrow all things will be new to you . " Oh , let it be a beautiful day , 65I prayed . I know that it 's May , but even in May the days can be wet and the sun not come at all . Let it be a beautiful day , with sun , and everything not only new but shining not just different , but new . I was awakened by a gentle tapping of fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was light . Lord Burnage was sitting by me . It was light , not daylight but dawnlight . He spoke quietly : " I wonder whether you 've ever seen that before , Sarah ? " No ; I never had , and it was wonderful to see . Away on our right hand the sky was pale , and as I watched , the clouds  --  small flaky clouds  --  turned from gray to silver and from silver to rose . The burning edge of the sun appeared , and all the sea between us and him suddenly danced with light . He climbed swiftly , and it was day : it was tomorrowwhen all things would be new , but now tomorrow was today . I looked up at the sails which had been dark all night and now were a rich brownish red . They shone . Everything shone . There was no land to be seen behind us or before us : nothing but shining water , and the sun which had burned the few clouds out of the sky , and the little shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The sun fell on my face and my hands and seemed to pierce even through the blanket that wrapped me . Lord Burnage said : " Would you like me to rouse Sally ? She 's had a good night 's sleep , and it would n't hurt you to turn in for an hour or two . I do n't want to hand you over to your mother worn to a shadow . " I begged to be allowed to stay where I was . " I want to see the land when it first appears . And you wo n't be handing me over , " I said . " You 'll be keeping me . I shall have you and Mama . Do you know what Captain Rodda said to me ? " " I would n't like to guess , my dear . That old pirate 's capable of saying anything . He could write the Psalms or the Decameron . " " What 's the Dec  --  the what you said ? " " It 's a book of wicked enjoyable stories . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me that I 'd never be happy if I was wicked . ' " I 'm not going to discuss that with you , Sarah , " he said firmly . " Perhapswe 'll talk it over in twenty years ' time . What did Captain Rodda say ? " " He said that today all things would be new for me . " He looked at me tenderly . " Yes . You wo n't find that the life we live in Cornwall is much like what you 've been used to . I hope you will be very happy . " I looked at him in amazement . How could he doubt it ? Did he not know that I loved him ? Could a wicked thing be enjoyable ? Was it wicked , this feeling in me : that it was not to meet Mama at Tresant , but to be with him there , that held all the promise of joy ? But I wrapped66this up in my heart , and I said : " What is Captain Rodda captain of ? Just this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger ships than this . " And Lord Burnage told me something of Captain Rodda , and the years as they passed filled in other things for me : things that a child could not have been told . Porteven was a village of inshore fishermen , and Eddy Rodda was the son of one of these : a small , timorous devout Methodist , who must have begun soon to wonder whether God had singled him out as another Job , so many were the tribulations heaped on him through his son . At fourteen Eddy Rodda was roistering . He was already bigger than his father , a wild and wayward handsome lad , strong as a horse and obstinateas a mule . At fifteen he began to drink and to chase the girls , and at sixteen he laid the father of one of these flat in the bar parlor of the Richard Grenville , the Tresant pub . That was a night I often heard talked of : a winter night with a southwest gale tearing into Porteven , filling the streets with a briny drench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there was this boy with his legs in the long sea boots stretched to the fire , comfortably drinking in the Richard Grenville , speaking to no one , placid as a young ox in a pasture , when the inn door burst open and the wind howled into the house , making the light of the oil lamps jump and the lamps swing under the wooden ceiling . And there is this man Richards , a grocer , but strong , burly , kicking the door shut behind him and advancing with this wretched girl of his shoved before him , she soaked to the skin and draggle-haired , for a wave had caught them as they scuttered along from his shop which is among the buildings huddling under the cliff that flanks the quay . He pushes her before him , under the yellow light of the lamps , where the tobacco smoke is settling down again after its wild dispersal , and there he holds her by the arm , saying nothing , but glaring at young Eddy Rodda . Everyone is very quiet , for everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hu-hu-u of the wind shrieking down the street , and the shake of the building , and the sudden splash as though someone had thrown a bucket of water at the window . Eddy Rodda looked at Richards and smiled . Then he spat into the brass spittoon at his feet , drained his tankard and got up . He put on his oilskin that was hanging on a hook , pulled on his sou'wester , and moved to the door . Still no one spoke , but Richards stepped in front of him , laid a detaining hand on him . Eddy shook him off , and then Richards struck . They say that no one had ever struck Rodda before , not his parents , certainly not the village boys over whom he had lorded it from the first . They say that he stopped , turned as if amazed , and that his eyes were terrible . Richards himself stepped away from that look , and pushed the girl behind him , down onto the bench where Rodda67had been sitting . Eddy struck him under the chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a table . There was a tinkle of breakingglass , a t ' ild whoosh of rain on the window , a wild cry of wind in the street , and a wild scream from the girl who rushed to her father , shouting that he was dead . I he looked dead enough , with blood trickling from a gash in his forehead and moving sluggishly among the sand on the floor . Eddy Rodda picked up from the bar a jug of water that stood there for diluting whisky , and chucked it hard into Richards 's face . Richards opened his eyes , and then Eddy , without a word to the girl or the men standing there , threw him over his shoulder and marched with him into the roaring storm . Mary Richards followed . She was a slip of a thing , miserable-looking that night as a drowned cat . She trailed twenty yards behind , and stopped when Eddy called at Doctor Curnow 's . He rang the bell , pushed open the door , and yelled above the yelling storm : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takin ' ' im ' ome . Better tell the doctor to come an ' ' ave a look at ' im . " Then off he went again , with Richards hanging like a sodden sack over his shoulder , moaning now and then . The girl followed . The night was as black as Hell 's mouth ; even in the inner harbor , shut by a sluice gate from the main impact of the storm , the boats were pitching furiously . Mary Richards saw the dark figure , compounded of two figures , staggering ahead of her , turn the corner toward the row of houses under the cliff . She , too , made the turn , and here the full weight of wind and water hit her , roaring in from the open sea . Her sodden clothes whipped about her , and the waves , beating up over the granite edging of the harbor , flew round her in icy spray higher than herself . She had to battle with the weather to move forward at all . Head down , she bored as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then this pressure was too great for her and drove her backward . The gleam of lamps in the windows of the houses drew her on . They were comforting ; but it seemed miraculousthat they were not blown out , for now the gale had reached its height . It seemed miraculous that anything  --  anything at all , whether frail lights or solid buildings  --  could withstand its strength . There was nothing but blackness weltering with hissing white , and off it this giant wind racing and yelling toward the shore . Mary 's head had been down . She had lost sight of the figure weaving and staggering ahead of her , and now , to get her breath , she sidled into the doorway of the first of the houses and held on to the door knob . She looked ahead , and at that moment it came : the crash that all the wild circumstances of the nights seemed to make inevitable . She saw Rodda hurled to the ground and her father roll a little away from him . Neither of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smacked down , soaking them where they lay . Then she beat with her fists on the door to which she was clinging , and people came out , and they picked up Rodda and Richards from among the debris of the wind-wrecked chimney and carried them both into Richards 's house . Eddy Rodda was already walking about when Doctor Curnow came . He had only been bruised and winded . Richards was dead . These were the important questions asked at the inquest , and the answers . The Coroner : Then in your opinion , Doctor Curnow , death was caused by a brick striking this man 's head , fracturing the skull , and causing bone splinters to penetrate the brain ? Doctor Curnow : Yes , sir . That is so . The Coroner : But there were other injuries to the head  --  on the other side of the head  --  and we have heard evidence as to how they were caused . Were these other injuries serious ? Doctor Curnow : Very . The Coroner : Had the deceased not been struck by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we might , even so , still be holding this inquest ? Doctor Curnow : That is a difficult question to answer , sir . The Coroner : Still , will you try to answer it , doctor ? Might theseinjuries that were first caused have proved , in themselves , fatal ? Doctor Curnow : They were very grave . The Coroner : I understand your reluctance , doctor , but I must press you to be frank . Dr. Curnow : I think they would have proved fatal within a few hours . The Coroner : There is one other question that I must put to you . Did these prior injuries , in your opinion , contribute in any way to this man 's death ? I mean , did they , for example , weaken the skull , so that the blow from the brick had , so to speak , already a bit of a start in its fatal work when it struck Richards 's head ? Doctor Curnow : No , sir . There was , if I may put it so , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was due entirely to the second injury . The Coroner : I am glad you have been able to give that answer with assurance . Otherwise , as this court will see , a grave charge would have lain against Edward Rodda . As it is , that young man finds himself in an extraordinary situation  --  one I have not known the like of in my long experience as a coroner ; one , indeed , that I do n't think can ever have been matched . A man whom he has , as the evidence shows , brutally struck would , in the doctor 's opinion , have died within a few hours from the injuries inflicted . I invite Edward69Rodda to consider the gravity of the situation in which , in that case , he would have found himself . But Richards , on the doctor 's evidence , did not , in fact , die from those injuries . In all seriousness and in all solemnity I say that it seems as though the hand of Providence inter- vela d to save Rodda from the consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is unlikely that a second miracle will save one who fails to learn the lesson of the first . " Accidental death , " was the verdict . Reading all this in the faded columns of a local newspaper , I could picture clearly enough the rather drab scene , staged in the bleak room of the local Sunday school , hear the sententious words of the coroner , see the lusty young giant , Eddy Rodda , looking about him as puzzled as a young bull in a pen on a railway station . It is the day after that wild fatal night : a day of such warm winter sunshine as can come to Cornwall . The sea is murmuring . The golden gorse , here and there along the cliffs , is shining in small radiant bosses . They say that when the inquest was ended , Rodda came out of the schoolroom and lingered in the roadway , channeled by last night 's storm , till Mary Richards appeared . He spoke to her , tried to take her arm , but she broke away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she would now be alone , for her mother was dead and she was an only child . Rodda went before her , walking quickly , looking back now and then , and when Mary reached the door of the shop he had passed it by a hundred yards and was standing as though waiting . As last night she had stood clutching the door knob of a neighbor 's house , so now she stood clutching her own , torn by a terrible indecision ; then suddenly she went quickly after Rodda . They went on together , turned left and eastward , walking along the cliffs . There are paths here and there going steeply down to the sands , which were golden that day  --  a clay of unexpected loveliness , which they call in winter , in those parts , a day lent  --  and watchers , who , you may be sure , were soon concealed among the heather and gorse of the cliff tops , saw those two , remote diminished figures , walking side by side , up and down , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born anew out of passion and sudden death . Mary Richards was fifteen then , and Eddy Rodda married her when she was twenty-five . Wesley was their only child . It would be a happy and romantic thing to record that Eddy became a new man after that night 's work . He did not , but he became a man rarely seen in Porteven . Mary ran the little shop , prospering on the sympathy of her neighbors , and the Porteven postmistress could be relied on to make known when she received a letter from foreign parts . They came two or three times a year , those letters , and from the stamps , as noted by the postmistress , Porteven was able to trace the Odyssey : to the Medi- terranean and India , to China and Japan , to Hawaii and Valparaiso , round the Horn to North America : and presently Porteven was able to say : " He 'll soon be home . " It was a bearded turbulent man who reappeared in Porteven . " Drinkinglike a fish and swearing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oldish man now , and some trivial occasion  --  I forget what  --  had brought him to Tresant . " I was only a youngster , " he said , " when Richards died , just come to Porteven  --  my first year there . It had been nothing but mumps an ' measles till that night , so I 'm not likely to forget it , or my sight of Rodda when he came back . I suppose I was the first person to see him  --  swaggering along the road with a sailor 's bag on his shoulder , an ' that damn great black beard of his . He 'd be about twenty then . " So it went , voyage after voyage , till Rodda was captain of a schooner trading to the Mediterranean , and he and Mary Richards were married . For a time all went well , and then his homecomings became scandalous again . And then he was home for good . His ship was run upon a reef in the Adriatic ; she and her cargo were a total loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodda , the court of inquiry learned , was hauled from his cabin at the critical moment , but could not stand on his feet . After that , Eddy Rodda became an inshore fisherman at Porteven , like his father , who was now dead . One autumn night Lord Burnage , who had a taste for such adventures , went out on the night 's fishing with Rodda and his son , then a boy of seventeen . These outings with the fleet , from which Lord Burnage , in blue jersey and sea boots , would return smelling like a fisherman , were among the things that the first Lady Burnage disliked . She detested all such things , could not understand why I3urnage was happier on a fishing boat in Cornwall than in a London drawing room . That autumn night , the wind died and a fog came up , blanketing them as they lay idly flapping , and out of the fog came a steamer that cut the fishing smack in two and then went on . All three of the men were good swimmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had received a paralyzing blow on the leg . Till dawn came , and a wind thinned the mist , and anothersmack came to their rescue , Eddy and Wesley supported Lord Burnage with the help of a drifting spar ; and that is why , when we crossed from Brest to Cornwall , it was in this ship which belonged to Lord Burnage , but which the Roddas were permitted to use as though it were their own. 7I was a miserable child when I at last reached Tresant . With the dawn the wind dropped . Miss Whale and Sally Gaylord came out70 7 ' of the cabin , and Wesley Rodda went in to light a stove and make tea . We ate breakfast with the sails drooping like the broken wings they were , and the mast lurching to and fro across a small arc of sky . I stopped looking at it : it made me feel so queer . Soon I had to rush to the side. however , until that wind so treacherously died , we had made good progress toward the Cornish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were still making a little progress , so that in the early afternoon , Sally shouted " Land ! " I was too ill to be interested . The slate-gray blur that my aching eyes could just make out looked remote and utterly inaccessible . Wesley announced : " There 's a puff comin ' , " and the puff came and lasted for an hour . By then , the blur was indubitable land , with discernible houses , fields and hedges . But we were becalmed again , the mast again at its sickening swaying . By now I felt that I had no stomach left to be sick from , nothing to be sick with , but I was succeedingin stirring up a bilious sediment that nauseated every inch of my being . Lord Burnage ordered Captain Rodda and Wesley to unlash the dinghy from the cabin top and put it overboard . " I 'll have to leave you to it , " he said to the captain . " Bring the luggage on to Tresant as soon as you can . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came for the first time into the little harbor of Porteven : Lord Burnage at the oars , my miserablehead in Whaley 's lap , and Sally holding my icy hand . I was carriedup the granite steps , and Sally , who seemed fully at home here , hustled me into a shop , where I sat down , and looked through the window at gulls swooping and screaming over fish offal on the other side of the harbor . Their screeching sawed into my aching head , and all the time I was in the little shop , smelling of lamp oil and onions and candles and cough drops , I felt as I am sure the first Lady Burnage must often have felt : that this was a dreadful place . Then we were driving along a road in a closed carriage that Lord Bumage had brought from some baiting stable , and Sally was exclaiming , calling my attention to daffodils and bluebells and heaven knows what . But I was not aware of them ; I was not even aware when we had turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted , excited : " It 's Robber ! " as a vast dog joined our cavalcade , almost killing me with barks of joyous welcome , running with us all the way to the house , splitting my skull . This huge creature 's legs on my shoulders and his tongue on my face , a bustle of unprepared servants , a journey upstairs in Lord Burnage 's arms , the warm bed that received my shivering body , and my mother 's fingertips spreading eau de cologne on my forehead : this is all I remember of my first coming to dear Tresant . Whaley drew the curtains and tiptoed out . In the shadowed72. room the bed was still a boat , with all the dizzying discomfort of a boat betrayed by its ally the wind , but now it was a warm boat , and the warmth slowly seeped through me , and from very far away I heard Sally 's voice saying : " Quiet , Robber ! Not another sound ! " I smiled happily , and slept . CHAPTER SIXITHE bar and the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tresant . On the morning after our arrival I walked that road for the first of the many times that I have walked it . This writing is being done wherever I chance to be : sometimes at Tresant , sometimes in London ; and if I am in London and grow weary  --  as , God knows , I often do now  --  I can lie back and shut my eyes and loiter along that lovely way . The woods and the lake , the bar and the sea : I can go back to them for refreshment in any weather . I can see the swans upon the summer water and hear the curlews in winter at their desolate piping . The bluebells in the springtime woods , and here and there white wood anemones , cool under the new-fledged wings of the beech trees ; the noble pines whose roots writhe up out of the ground and down in again , wrestling for a grip in fissures of rock . The June solemnity , when down the rides one sees the blue of the burning day like daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and beechnuts and acorns dropping upon the crisp red leaves with a sound that is small till you listen to the silence and hear it again and again , when it becomes terrible and obsessive , the footfall of stealthy ruin , the falling apart of one more year ; and winter , when you come out from the woods and suddenly there is the bar , and the wild sea beyond it , with the wind driving you backward and the long Atlantic rollers pounding in and smashing furiously upon the sand. 2When I awoke I felt well but hollow . I got out of bed and pulled aside the curtains . Beneath me was the graveled circle on which last night we had drawn up at the front door . I wondered if I should have a glimpse of the sea . I had n't , for Tresant stands with its back to the sea , sheltering under a wooded hill that hides the water and73breaks up the Atlantic winds . Beyond the gravel was a lawn that ended in an iron railing , and beyond that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far side of the meadow the land rose slightly and was wooded . There was nothing more that I could see . The sound of my moving about must have been heard , for the door opened and a maid came in with a breakfast tray . I got back into bed and she placed it across my knees . I asked if Miss Whale were up , and was told that she and everybody else had been up for hours . It was ten o'clock . They were all gone out . They were gone to the bar , and if I felt well enough , would I please join them . When I was out of doors I was glad to be alone . I had been told how to get to the bar , and as soon as I was beyond the front door , in the May sunshine , I stood still with a thought suddenly in my mind . This was the first time I had been told how to get anywhere ! Till now , I had been taken . The way I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , and through woods , and all this certainly would never have been " safe " for me in Papa 's eyes ! And now it was with a shock of pleasure that I had a sense of shackles loosened and of enormously enlarged possibility . Suddenly I began to run and sing . All the way to the bar I made a rushing and a dawdling of it on that May morning : a joyful rushing because of the sunshine and the way the rooks were cawing and a cuckoo was shouting and the blackbirdsand the graybirds , as they call the thrushes down there , were scuttering among the bushes with bursts of song . Dawdling when sudden enchantment held me . I came to the lake , and I must tell you how the lake is . Years ago , I imagine , it was an arm of the sea . It is long and narrow , and at its southern end the bar rises up , a vast ridge of sand , and shuts it in from the salt water , and every raging storm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own furious throat more and more sand and pebbles that raise the bar still higher . So there now that lake of pure water is , running north from the sea , with dense woods on its rocky rising western bank and pasture sloping more gradually down on the east . When it has run north for a mile it broadens out toward the west , toward Tresant , and it was here , when I first came on this broad water , that my flighty running stopped and I stood enchanted , looking at what is still to me the place where all my heart is . I was looking through trees that stood in a small meadow , and between the smooth gray boles  --  for these were beeches  --  shone the water on which the sunshine lay in flecks and sparkles . There were rafts of water-lily leaves that would in time support a freight of creamy lilies and red lilies , but the year was not yet ready for that . A punt74was moving across the water , lazily paddled by a man who sat in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to rest on the far shore where there was a wooden jetty and a boat house . The man got out and walked into a cottage that stood beyond a lawn , and it seemed to me that nowhere in the world would you find a place of more peace than that cottage , with the lake water in front of it and the trees close about it . A pennant of blue smoke hung over a chimney . How small and set about my life had been till then ! I was a child of the fortunate class , but I had seen nothing but a few London streets and parks , the sea at Broadstairs , and a corner of France that had been exciting enough but had shown me nothing like this . And the great joy of it was that I was alone . I felt as though I had suddenly become responsible enough to be entrusted with the whole world . The way I had been told to go turned to the right , which is to the south , and now I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on the left the rocky western bank of the lake . Trees found root-hold there , and you could look through them , down to the water . It is like that all the way to the bar : the woods and the path and the rocky , tree-grown abrupt declivity to the lake . I want to make it clear , once and for all , and I never saw it more sharply than on that first morning . The woods were full of bluebells ; they were an azure misty lake , and because the trees were not fully clothed the sun was coining through , lighting them up and turning to shining pewter the trunks of the beeches that rose out of them . The beech leaves had not yet shed the husks out of which they had been born , and the silvery down of childhood was on them . This path along which I had been loitering had been hewn here and there through reddish rock , and splendid pines were there , the trunks rough like crocodile hide , and the roots fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil had been heaved and torn in a great area round about , and terrifying that must have been for many creatures of earth and air , like the death of a mighty one on whom many simple lives had depended . But I must not go on about the woods and walks of Tresant : about the rafty nest on which that day I saw a swan sitting , or about the badgers that later , when I had come to know the place well , I saw grunting along the path . It is all so much to me that I could become tiresome to those who do not know it . For a mile that path runs between wood and water , and halfway along it that day I stopped , spellbound by a small sinuous creature that looked at me for a moment and then rippled out of sight . I know now that it was a stoat , but I did not know that then . To my right the rock rose up rather sharply at this spot , pine-fringed , and on the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into these that the little creature had disappeared , and I ran forward , hoping to see75it again , and began to draw the bushes apart . I saw that behind them there was a hole in the rock , shaped like a door ; and , fascinated as any child would be at the thought of a cave , I was preparing to look farther when there was a rustling in the mat of pine needles over my head . Looking up , I was surprised to see Captain Rodda , wearing his tasseled cap , gazing calmly down at me . He had one arm hooked round a pine trunk , the other was stroking his beard . We looked at one an- other in silence for a moment , and then he shouted cheerfully : " Good morning , midear . How be the ole stomach this mornin ' ? Settled , I hope . " " Yes , thank you , Captain Rodda , " I answered politely , but a little startled by this unexpected appearance , by this sense of having been watched when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to my side in a rush of shale . " I saw a little animal , " I said . And added innocently : " I think it was a squirrel . " " I saw un , " he said . " That were n't no ole squirrel . That were a stot . Vicious things they be . Do n't ' e ever go pokin ' about after stots , midear . Leave the bushes alone . Do n't ' e go pokin ' into the ole bushes . " I said nothing about the hole in the rock , and he seemed anxious to be gone from that place . He began to walk in the direction of the bar , and I trotted at his side . We had n't gone far when the woods began to peter out and the rock faces to be clothed with cascades of mesembryanthemum , the noon flower , dark green fleshy leaves and starry blossoms of rose and creamy yellow . We began to hear the break- ers . Ahead of us , sitting on a wall , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there , visible from where we sat , was the sea . It is a superb prospect from that spot . Facing the wall is a rough bank clothed with heather , bracken and sea pinks . Below the wall is a drop down to the lake , shallow here , so that you see the herons ' feet as they wade and the dark shadows that arc fishes , now poised , now darting . Closing in the lake is the ridge , the bar , a quarter of a mile of shining sand ; and then the sea , reaching away beyond the limits of sight . 3 Captain Rodda came up and invited us all to take a cup of tea in his cottage . " And ere have you suddenly risen from ? " Sally asked him . " Miss Whale and I have been dawdling here for an hour or more . We did n't see you go by . " " I climbed up back an ' came down through the ole woods , " the captain answered easily . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We had not far to go to reach the cottage , but that little distance made an enormous difference to the prospect . The path ended in a gate , and Eddy 's cottage was just there . It was , in fact , one of the lodges to the Tresant estate : a forthright little building of stone , all its corners reinforced with granite . It was as strong and stony and uncompromising as the cottage by the lake was gentle and romantic : that cottage at which I had looked earlier and which , I learned in time , was another lodge entrance to Tresant . Eddy 's cottage , perched on the very edge of the cliff , was surrounded by a wall as utilitarian as itself . " ' Er needs to be strong , " he said with a grin , pulling off his tasseled cap and scratching his head ; and indeed you could see that , for now the prospect had opened out , and east , west and south was nothing but the sea . The cliff path ran ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile away , clustered round its harbor . Those were the nearest habitations , and it could be terrible in the winter , I thought , here in this stone eyrie leaning out into all the winds of the world . " Ay , " said Eddy Rodda , his fingers combing his black beard , " she looks fine an ' cozy now , the ole sea , fine an ' cozy " ; and Sally said : " But not so fine and cozy when the lifeboat goes out . Captain Rodda is cox'n of the lifeboat , " she added for our enlightenment . " My father and Wesley are in the crew . " More and more surprising . More and more different , this life in which I could still feel the splash of being so suddenly dropped . Imagine my Papa in a lifeboat ! No , no ; you could n't . But you could imagine Lord Burnage , and the great oars lifting and dipping , and the boat plunging and climbing , and the wild gray rags of a disordered night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not easily that morning , as Captain Rodda repeated : " Ay , fine an ' cozy now , " and then , pulling himself up : " Well , come on in , midears . " If I had at that time known the story of Captain Rodda and the death of Richards the grocer  --  but I did not  --  I should not have found it easy to recognize in Mrs. Rodda the " slip of a girl " who had been Mary Richards . Mrs. Rodda was short : short in speech , short in body , short of breath . She was a heavy , rolling , female creature , as broad as she was long , florid in the face , and gray-haired . She brought tea into the front room , put the tray onto a bamboo table , gave a bob in our direction , and went out . Through a window , we could see Wesley Rodda mending wicker lobster pots : how ignorant I was ! I did n't know they were lobster pots till Sally told me : and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn , not only about such things as lobster pots but about rooms like this . I had never been in such a room before . It had no sense of being used . The furniture was upholstered in slippy pricky horsehair ; the top of the harmonium was76 I 1 77decorated with large pearly shells ; on the mantelpiece was a small porcelain pulpit with John Wesley perched in it , and a book of Wesleyan hymns stood on the music bracket of the harmonium . The only pie ' urr in the room was over the mantelpiece : a steel engraving showing ; John Wesley preaching on the edge of Gwennap Pit . It was not difficult to see that here was the inspiration of the discourse Captain Rodda had given me . It was all in the picture : the preacher 's white hands and uplifted angelic face , the sunlight piercing the clouds and falling upon the anguished eyes and locked fingers of trembling sinners ; even the old horse was standing by , ready to jog along with the principal actor to his next stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Whaley said : " I wonder whether we might have the window open ? " The little room was stuffy with unused air . " Not without asking Mrs. Rodda 's permission , " said Sally , who went through and knocked at the kitchen door . Mrs. Rodda , wiping her hands on an apron of sacking , came back and opened the window with difficulty and reluctance . Then surprisingly ( to me ) she said : " Would you like a tune , Miss Sally ? " " Yes , " said Sally . " I 'm sure we all would , if we 're not hinderingyou. , , The ungainly woman sat down at the instrument , rubbed her hands once or twice on her sack-covered thighs , and began to play . At the first sound of the music Captain Rodda came to the window and pulled it further down . His wife had conceded only a meager slit . But now there was space enough for Eddy Rodda 's laughing face to come into the room . Mrs. Rodda sang as she played , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Wesley also , sitting on a bench with a lobster pot on the ground before him , chimed in . And now I saw an odd thing , odder even than this sudden offer to sit down and inflict a hymn on us . Because you did n't have to know the Roddas long to realize that there was nothing odd about that at all . They were a singing family ; they loved singing ; and the only things they knew to sing were hymns . No ; the really odd and moving thing was to observe Mary Rodda 's face . The stolid flesh seemed to soften . She was a tender woman . All the time she sang , her eyes were on Rodda leaning through the window , and his on her . It seemed as though the handsome corsair hypnotized her , and as she quaveredThine is the power ; behold I sitIn willing bonds before Thy feet , you would have been hard put to it to say whether she was singing to him or to her God. 78 " Well , me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done , " an'some that was , ' an'some . " And he added : " Speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and makingmelody with your heart to the Lord . Eh , Wesley , boy ? " Wesley did not answer . He had dropped the lobster pot and walked to the low wall beyond which was the cliff path to Porteven . Beyond the wall we could see a girl 's head and shoulders and a huddle of shawl out of which a baby 's face appeared . And now another transformationcame over the countenance of Mary Rodda . It became red and congested , as though she were going to have a fit . Captain Rodda had disappeared . He must have gone into the house by a back door . Mrs. Rodda was shouting through the window : " You go back where you belong , Lucy Evans . Go on now . You do n't belong to be ' ere ! I wo n't ' ave you hangin ' about ! " She was shaking her fist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm round each . " We must be off , " she said . And without a word to Mrs. Rodda , who seemed to have forgotten our presence , we went . When we were on the path , we could see the girl and the bundled child moving toward Porteven , still pursued by Mrs. Rodda 's voice ; but , voice or no voice , we saw Wesley leap the wall and go after them . Sally said : " Poor Lucy Evans . Everyone shouts after her . She 's not married and she 's got a baby . " 4I am afraid that most people today , if they heard this remark from a girl of ten , would think it unusually mature and , perhaps , " not quite nice . " Sally said what she had to say about Lucy Evans simply and sensibly , and all her conversation , I think , would sound " grownup " to a contemporary parent . Nothing more was said then concerning Lucy Evans . We walked out of the Roddas ' house , and in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We strolled on the sand and to the edge of the water that always there comes in with a roll , never with the pussy purring that you find on some beaches . " Fine and cozy " she looked that day , as Eddy Rodda had said ; but Sally talked to us of the winter fury , told us how ships had been driven ashore here and bodies washed up . " Have you ever known nights when his lordship has been out in the lifeboat ? " Whaley asked . " Oh , yes , " said Sally , " not many , but enough . I ca n't sleep then . The hill and the wood shelter Tresant , so that when the worst79winds are blowing out here , it 's calm enough in there . But that 's no good , because you know what it 's like outside , and once you know , you ca n't put your head under a sheet and go to sleep , can you ? You 'd feel such a worm . That is why I despise my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whale did not wish to discuss . " Well , " she said , " shall we walk on a little , or should we be getting back to the house ? " " Oh , " Sally cried , refusing to be sidetracked , " I know I should n't talk about such things , but you might as well know how I feel . " And then she let out something that had evidently been simmering in her heart for a long time . She told of a night of storm and of how Lord Burnage had gone to Porteven , as he did when it was likely that the boat would go out . Later a messenger came to say that distress signals had been seen and that the boat was gone . Sally went to bed at her usual time , but she did not sleep , for her imagination pictured the little boat , so unlike a powered lifeboat of today  --  the little open boat , depending on nothing but arms at the oars , the oil-skinned crew slashed by the wind and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only one thing , " Sally said , " that made me a bit happier than I should otherwise have been , and that was that Mama was up and would look after him when he came home . But presently Iheard her go to bed . " Sally could n't believe it . She got out of her own bed and crept to her mother 's door . " She always said her prayers , and she had a and she laughed and said it was so that God could hear better . I could hear her prayers that night . They were all askings , and I loathed her . There was n't a word about my father or Captain Rodda or Wesley . It was all bless me and give me . So I knelt down right against the door , and I prayed in a loud voice , and I asked God to bless any men whose ship might be in danger and to help the lifeboat men to save them and bring them safely home . " The next thing Sally knew was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candle , with her hair down to her waist and her eyes hard with anger . " What is this ? " she cried . " Have you come to insult me ? " Sally was speechless with rage and misery . Her mother took her by the arm , marched her to her own room , and commanded her to get into bed . Then she went out and locked the door . " It was that , " said Sally , " that finished it forever between her and me . She would not wait up for him herself , and she tried to stop me from doing it , too . " Sally sat on her bed and heard a clock on the landing strike ten . She opened the window and got out . There was a tree growing up to the window , and its branches were as easy to manage as the rungs 8o of a ladder . There was nothing romantic in her first impulse . Since she could n't get downstairs by opening her door , she would reach the ground and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in mind . But as soon as she was down , she saw that this would not do . Servants would be waiting up . She would be marched to bed again . Nor was it possible for her to clothe herself properly to meet such a night as this , for her oilskins were in a cupboard downstairs , and she could not reach them without being seen . The southwest wind did not reach in here with much force , but the rain was falling heavily , and already , while she was pondering her situation , it was soaking her light clothes . Presently it stopped , and through the clouds that began to break up she could see the moon lurching about the sky . She decided to walk to Porteven . You can make that journey either by going along the lake and through the woods to Eddy Rodda 's lodge and then for a mile along the cliffs , or by leaving the grounds of Tresant in the opposite direction and following the high road . To a town child like me , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Sally knew every yard of road and every field and tree and every person living in that district , so that , for her , there was no emotional disturbance arising from the physical facts of the situation . But there was intense emotionaldisturbance arising from the conflict which had suddenly blown up with her mother , especially as this concerned her almost idolatrous feeling for her father . It was a child outwardly unconcernedbut with a terrible premature turmoil in her heart who hurried along the road , exposed to the wind now , with the trees lashing over her head and the stormy sky opening and shutting its doors upon the moon . And that , when she found him , he and those who had gone out with him had failed : this was what made the matter more terrible to her than it would otherwise have been . For it was a downcast beaten man she met being driven home by Dr. Curnow . When she was halfway to Porteven she saw the gig lamps twinkling toward her , and got into the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted : " Good God , child ! What are you up to ? " She got in and gave a cry when she saw her father leaning back exhausted , a bandage round his head , his eyes closed . He put an arm round her and drew her onto his lap and murmured : " God , Sal , you 're soaked , " but seemed unable to say more . When they reached the house and the servants were gaping at this appearance out of the night of a child they had thought to be sleeping , Dr. Curnow said : " Now , Sally , get off to bed . Tomorrow will do for any explanations , " and obediently she went , leaving her father sitting in a chair by the fire in the hall . She learned afterward how wind and81water had beaten the lifeboat back time after time as it struggled to reach the little ship dragging at her anchor , with the waves pounding over her , sweeping men from the deck before their eyes , carrying away spars and finally the mainmast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her go under , and a wash of rubbish  --  hencoops and barrels and broken gear  --  came tossing on the waves toward them . It was some fag end of this stuff , carried on the hissing water , that struck Lord Burnage on the forehead , stunning him . She learned this afterward , but that night , just as she was opening her bedroom door , the turned key being still in the rock , her mother came out from her room , aroused by a servant . Sally and her mother looked at one another for a moment , but neither spoke . " I think , " Sally said to me years later , " that each of us knew in her own way that there was nothing to be said , nothing at all . It was a crossroads moment . What had happened showed that she had made up her mind to go one way and I the other . The Duke of Fallowshire came down for the shooting the next week . " 5We were on the western end of the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in green rising land . " There they are ! " Sally cried , and in the distance we saw two riders coming toward us . It is a moment framing one of those pictures that do not fade : the morning of late May with the sun strengthening , the sea on our right tumbling in noisily but not angrily , the sand rolling away like an enormous golden carpet to where the land rose up in sage-green cliff tops marching eastward to the Lizard . Coming toward us were the two mounted figures , the horses trotting sedately , then breaking into a canter that rose to a gallop , so that , when they pulled up before us , both they and their riders were breathing heavily . Lord Burnage lcai t to the ground , and Sally took the reins of his horse as he helped my mother to dismount . She was flushed and laughing . I had never seen her look so handsome or so happy . She had never spoken much to me of her own girlhood , but I knew she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding , and that my father 's dislike of it had been one of her sorrows . In more ways than one , at Tresant she must have found her youth again . Children are not often aware of what their parents look like , but that morning I saw that my mother was a most beautiful woman . She put me from her when she had kissed me , and held me at arm 's length , looking at me . There was something almost shy in her manner , as though she wondered how I would take to her after the disrupting things that had happened ; almost  --  God forgive me if anything in my82conduct made such an idea necessary  --  almost as though she were asking me to forgive her . She turned to Lord Burnage , and , child though I was , I could not help seeing how his face and hers brightened as their glances met . " Well , Harry , " she said , " is she all right ? Are you satisfied that I have n't brought you a monster ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , " he said . " She does n't look bad stuff to start working on . She and I got on pretty well from the start , did n't we , Miss Whale ? " " She certainly made a profit out of the meeting , " said Whaley ; and I blushed to think how shamelessly that morning in Bond Street I had accepted all that his good nature offered . " Well , " said Lord Burnage , " I made a profit , too , " and again his eyes met Mama 's . I did not feel now that I was with him as intimately as I had been during the journey through France . I had been moved aside a little , and I felt that this was a shadow over the group talking so happilyon the sand . I asked abruptly : " What am I to call you , sir ? I cannotcall you Lord Burnage ? " He laughed immensely at that . " Why not ? " he teased me . " It 's an excellent name . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ? " " Well , " I said , " I did n't call Papa Sir Richard Rainborough . " It was a mistake to mention Papa . I saw that at once . The smile went off Lord Burnage 's face and off Mama 's . Sally said : " I hate Papas and Mamas . I positively hate them . From now on I shall call you two Father and Mother , and I think Sarah had better do the same . " " How does that suit Sarah ? " Lord Burnage asked . It suited me so well that for the rest of this narrative Father must be understood to mean Lord Burnage , not Sir Richard Rainborough. 6My father and mother , then , put their horses to the path that climbed from the beach to Eddy Rodda 's cottage and went before us at a walkingpace through the wood . Sally was running ahead of me and Whaley , answering the whistle of a blackbird , swinging on branches of trees that grew out of the rocky declivity toward the lake . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whale shouted ; and Sally shouted back : " What would it matter ? I can swim . I have swum right across this lake , but I prefer the sea . " " It would n't be nice to get your clothes wet through , " Whaley warned her ; and she shouted back : " I could change them . It 's not as though 83I ever caught cold . You ask Dr. Curnow . He says I 'm a tough little devil . " Then she was reaching up into a half-greened hazel , to show us the nest of a thrush or blackbird . She lifted out the eggs : the blue with black spots , the green mottled with brown : and this was something I had never seen before . I begged to be allowed to hold them . " You wo n't find those in Portman Square ! " Sally said decisively . " Oh , the dirty old sooty laurels ! I 'm glad I sha n't see them this year . " " Is his lordship remaining here all through the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , but we are . Father and mother will be going soon  --  almost at once . " She skipped away after a red squirrel , leaving us to digest this unexpectednews . When we overtook her , she had reached the point whence you look across the lake to the cottage standing on the lawn beyond the boathouse . " How lovely that is ! " Whaley cried . Sally said : " It 'll be going begging soon . I wonder whom Father will put in there ? " " Oh , does it belong to Father ? " I cried , anxious to have this new name in my mouth . " Yes , indeed , " said Sally . " The estate goes right away beyond that for a mile or so . " She looked ponderingly at the cottage , shining so happily in the noon light ; and then  --  what a surprising girl she was !  --  she said seriously : " Look , you two . You must n't think everything is what it seems . You 'll soon learn that down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea when she 's fine an ' cozy . He knows too much about the sea to be taken in . There have been some horrible things in that cottage . Mr. and Mrs. Bennetts lived there , and now he 's alone . She died in agony . " It had taken Mrs. Bennetts more than a year to die . Sally used to read to her as she lay in bed . " Old Bennetts ca n't read a word , " she said . " There he is . " Out of the cottage came the man I had seen paddlingthe punt , looking , I thought , so blissfully content in the sweet May weather . " He used to sit on one side of the bed , " said Sally , " and I on the other . Anything out of the Bible Mrs. Bennetts liked . I 'd open it anywhere and start off at the first thing my eyes fell on . She liked it all : the tower of Babel or the New Testament or the long lists of people who begat other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Really  --  Sally ! " Whaley cried ; and then , primly remembering her place , " Miss Sally , I should say . " " Call me what you like , " said Sally . " But everyone knows about Eddy Rodda and Lucy Evans . " What gardeners and stableboys talked about was not lost on Sally . We began to walk on , and Sally told us how , as her readings went on week by week and month by month , Mrs. Bennetts 's groans became84worse , her agony more apparent , until at last Dr. Curnow had forbidden the readings , " so that , " said Sally , as though she had missed something , " I was n't with her when she died . " Bennetts had lived alone in the lodge since then , and now , it seemed , his brother 's wife had died , too . The brother had a small farm , and Bennetts intended to join him there , " and so , " Sally explained , " the place will be going begging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Portman Square , I got out of bed one night and went into the schooloom to consult Miss Whale about something that was on my mind . I found her bowed over the table , writing away on large sheets of paper . It had never occurred to me that this had anything to do with the profoundest side of Whaley 's life ; but a new light fell upon it that afternoon of my first day at Tresant . Sally , Whaley and I were summoned to attend my father in the library , and he invited us all to sit down . " There is a lot that we must discuss , " he said , as we sank into our chairs . " But first of all , there is a letter here for you , Miss Whale . " He took a letter from his desk and handed it to her , and no one could fail to see the animation , the excitement , of her face when she looked at it . This indeed was so remarkable that Father said : " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whale , pray do so . " Making an apology , Whaley tore open the letter with a trembling hand , read hastily , and cried " Oh ! " in a small astonished voice , which caused my father to say : " I trust you have no bad news ? " Whaley had risen , and was now visibly trembling with excitement . " Indeed , no , my lord , " she said . " It is wonderful news  --  incredible . " We all looked at her in some surprise , and she sank back into her chair and said in a breathless rush . " I can hardly believe it ! Mr. Dickens is going to use one of my stories in Household Words . " " Well , " said my father , " but that is splendid . I had no idea that you were an author . " Having made her first announcement , Whaley seemed unable to say more . She just sat there , with the letter shaking in her hand , and Father said : " I am sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated editor . I have met Mr. Dickens at Miss BurdettCoutts 's . " He added with a smile . " His waistcoat repelled me . Rather florid . " Whaley rallied at that and burst out : " It would be a sad thing , sir , if so great a man were judged by his little vanities . " " Indeed it would , " Father soothed her . " Forgive me . Do n't think I am unaware that Mr. Dickens is a very great man . " 85Oh , he is , he is ! 1 was thinking ; for to me it seemed almost as wonderfulas it must have clone to Whaley that the letter she held in her hand was hour the man whose books had for so long been beloved by her and me . She had read them all to me , and I had read some for myself. ; we had laughed and cried over them together ; and now I could not resist saying : " Please let me see . " Whaley handed me the letter and 1 looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line that came to and fro beneath itself again and again , I read " Charles Dickens . " 1 looked at Whaley in awe and wonder . " I le asks for more , " she said quietly , as if this too could not be true . " That is excellent , " said Father . " But this , I fear , may alter all I intended to say . This is a great chance for you , Miss Whale , and no doubt you will wish to leave us  --  to go to London where you can be in touch with people who will be of advantage to you . " But , happily , this did not seem to be what Whaley wanted at all . " Oh dear , no , sir ! " she cried . " I was brought up in the country , and I am happier in the country than in town . All I have ever tried to write has been concerned with the country and will continue to be so . " " All the same , " said my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the encouragement you now have , you may want to give time to writing , and you can hardly do that if you continue to have the care of these two young people . I 'm afraid it 's going to be a bigger task than ever , for Lady Burnage and I will soon be leaving for London and you 'll have the whole responsibility on your shoulders . " Whaley said that she had all the time she needed for her writing and that she would be glad to stay . " Very well , then . We shall have to find time later to discuss the curriculum " ; and to me and Sally , with a smile , " the curriculum meaningthe work to be done . And now , if you two will leave us , there are a few things I want to speak of with Miss Whale . " It was the question of Lucy Evans , above all , that he wanted to discuss , and the ins and outs of this question , as 1 learned them later , were simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Burnage in the Crimea and became a groom at Tresant when the war was over . A little bow-legged timid man was Evans , and his wife a tall dour woman who seemed the better man of the two . Evans died , and the woman , left with a growing girl , was given work in the sculleriesat Tresant , the cottage where she had lived having been taken from her by the landlord . This scullery work was all she could find to do , and she did n't want to do even that . She soon took herself off , and , having nowhere else to live , seized a decaying shack in a field on the outskirts of Porteven and installed herself there with the girl . There was argument for a long time with the owner of the field , but now , having been there for some years , Mrs. Evans had established squatter's86rights and no one disturbed her . She was forever tinkering the place up with a plank stolen here or a bit of sheet iron found there , and she wandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a handy , defiant and self-sufficient creature , well able to fend for herself . She had built a fireplace and chimney in one end of the shack . She and Lucy were to be seen with the gleaners after the harvests and working the autumn hedgerows for fruits and berries with which Mrs. Evans made jams and wines . It was said that the pot never lacked a hare or a rabbit , or even a pheasant . She was as good a poacher as any in the district . She never passed a tatter of wool left by a sheep in a hedge without gathering it . She carded it and spun it , dyed it with dyes made from vegetables , and knitted herself clothes . Leading this life , she became a lean hard creature , living to herself , and she was treated with caution and respect . The woman of this mechanized age , even most village women , would have died where Betty Evans lived with a flourish . Betty adored her child Lucy . Lucy was her triumph . Living as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could bring up a child with the best . Lucy was good-looking , shy as a wild creature , for she was rarely permitted to go even into Porteven . Mrs. Evans could read and write , and she taught the girl to do so . The ambition flowered in her mind to " make something " of Lucy . When Lucy grew up , she , too , would " show them . " On shiny nights when Betty was abroad , she locked the girl in the shack with a book and a candle . On one of the rare occasions when Mrs. Evans and Lucy were in Porteven , they were seen by Wesley Rodda , then a boy of eighteen or nineteen . Like everyone else in the place , he knew who they were , understood the almost witchlike reputation of the mother and the mysteriousevasiveness of the girl . He made a shy gesture toward his hat , and Lucy Evans smiled at him . Girls were not in the habit of smiling at Wesley . He was known already as a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and altogether a grave reserved person . He was surprised when Lucy smiled . It was the sort of thing that did n't belong to happen to him . He followed the pair for a time with his heart in a turmoil ; and suddenly the lean brown woman stopped , faced round to him , and stared him out of countenance . She simply said : " Be off with you ! " and he slunk away . There were standers-by , and they laughed , and Wesley wished he could disappear beneath the earth . But he heard  --  he heard for days thereafter  --  Lucy 's gentle voice saying : " Hush , mother ! That 's no way to speak . " He took to wandering out toward the shack , and he saw that it was a comely enough place that had improved with the years . There was even , in front of it , a flower bed marked out in white stones , and daffodilswere bending in it before an April wind . He did not see Betty or87Lucy , but he was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daffodils . On the Sundry after that , Wesley was the preacher in the Methodist chapel . Lucy was in the small congregation . He could hardly speak for the cnwt ions that were in his heart . It was his habit , when the service was over , to stand in the porch and shake hands with the people as they left , saying a word to each . He shook hands with Lucy , and they smiled again at one another , and he asked : " Did you plant the daffodils ? " " Yes , " she said . That was all they said ; but to Wesley it was as though they had exchanged lovers ' vows. 8Lucy was able to attend the chapel service because her mother was out . The girl had promised to stay at home , and for the first time she broke her word . Poor Wesley did not know that she had smiled at him because he was Eddy Rodda 's son , or that she attended the service because , having seen the son 's name announced as preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there , tea . For she was under the spell which , years ago , after the inquest on Richards the grocer , had drawn his daughter to follow Eddy along the cliffs . Not long before this , Betty Evans and Lucy had been on the sands under the Roddas ' lodge , gathering driftwood after a storm . At least , Betty was gathering it and Lucy was enjoying the beauty of the spring morning . The task of " making something " of Lucy , which had become an obsession with Betty , the one thing to which all her life was directed , did not involve making the girl do hard work . Lucy 's hands were white and as soft as her voice . It was Mrs. Evans who lugged together the chunks of wood , stained with tar , spiked with rusty nails , splintered and wounding . Mrs. Evans 's hands were like her face : tough and leathery . She piled her burden , passed round it a rope she had brought for the purpose , and began to haul it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' ansome woman . " Captain Rodda came out from a cleft of the rocks whence he had been watching them , and laid his hand on the burden . To Lucy 's surprise , her mother did not tell him to be off . " A woman like you do n't belong to be carrying great chunks of stuff like that . " He swung the burden up as if it had been a child 's satchel . Mrs. Evans said nothing , but still she did not repel him . They dawdled along the beach together . Lucy was extraordinarily happy . To have a third party with them broke up the unnatural feeling of isolation in which she normally lived and which had begun to oppress her . Her heart expanded . Her surprise at her mother 's acceptance of Captain Rodda would not have been so great had she known that on a shiny88night in the winter Betty and Eddy had come face to face in the Tresant woods . They had been skirmishing round one another for a long time , each supposing the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had laughed together in relief . They had hunted as a pair after that throughout the winter , and Betty Evans discovered that she was not altogether the mannishcreature which she supposed the years had made of her . To be alone with Eddy Rodda in the woods soon taught her that . And so they moved toward Porteven , and presently Rodda dropped his burden and said : " There 's a fine ole log comin ' in . Wait a minute now . We must get'n . " In his long sea boots he waded into the water and hauled the wood ashore . He held it up triumphantly . " Mahogany that is ! Now you wo n't want to be burnin ' that , midear . A couple of fine ole shelves or a chimneypiece that 'll make . You let me come an ' see to that . I 'll fix'n . " But now Betty Evans pulled herself back into her customary reticence . " No , " she said . " We never have anyone about our place . We do n't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . " Directly appealed to in this way , the girl was at a loss . She liked this handsome swaggerer with the black beard and flashing teeth and the tasseled cap drooping over his ear . She had heard of Captain Rodda . Even to her retired existence some rumor of his legend had penetrated . In a community of fishermen whose farthest beat was the coast of Brittany , he stood alone as one who had sailed the seas of the world . She tossed out of her hand the yellow shells she had been gathering and looked at her mother . Betty had hoisted the roped wood onto her shoulder . They were near Porteven . She was not going to be seen walking through the village with Captain Rodda . " I do n't like to be alone . Not all the time , " Lucy said . That was as far as she dared to go . Betty looked at her and pondered . When she had made something of Lucy the girl would have to leave her . She would have to meet people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , anyway ? Betty 's notions about launching a girl into a career were vague . Captain Rodda had the reputation of being a man of the world . Perhaps he could help . Perhaps the time had come to end this seclusion . " Very well , " she said grudgingly . With that they parted , Betty trudging with her load in one direction , the captain bearing his mahogany log in the other . For a moment Lucy stood still , looking from one to the other ; then hastened after Betty. 9To reach the and climbed through a 89gap in the hedge . Nlr ; . I , vans made that gap -- a small gap then , just enough to push herself through  --  when she tix ) k possession . It had gradually grown wider , though the fanner who owned the land stopped it up now and then in the beginning with lopped branches . Mrs. Evans pulled their out , and at last the farmer gave tip the struggle , and the gap widened , but there had never been a straight run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank . Late that same day , Eddy Rodda did so , carrying his mahogany log . Ile might easily have brought a few tools at the same time , but he thought it would be better to have an excuse for coining again . There was no one in the shack , so he dumped the log under the hedge and looked about him . He had learned in the course of this winter to have a high opinion of Betty Evans 's self-sufficiency , and what he saw now confirmed this . He smiled to see how in the course of the years she had stealthily extended her territory , so that not only the shack but the whole of this corner of the field had become virtually hers . She had been crafty enough not to make any enclosure , but she had pushed out a vegetable bed here , a row of bush fruit there , till the place had a prosperouscared-for appearance , as though the occupants did not lack . The trees that made the right angle of hedge in which the shack nestled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air with fragrance . Looking over the roofs of Porteven , you could see the blue water stretching itself lazily in the sun . Eddy Rodda smiled and approved it all . He was enough of a buccaneerhimself to enjoy the spectacle of this piece of land that had been insidiously stolen . The winter was over , but nevertheless the woodpile in the hedge corner was full . That was good , too . Mrs. Evans was evidentlynot one to let things run down . He turned up again the next day with his tools and found the women at home . He was asked in , and his was the first foot that had crossed that threshold since the shack had been Betty Evans 's home . It was one large room , whitewashed throughout , walls and ceiling alike . The floor was of neatly laid bricks , and where these had come from , a few at a time in the quiet of winter nights , was Betty 's business . Bricks composed the hearth and the chimney , too . Bits of old tarpaulin kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarpaulin whether it was derelict or , not being derelict , privily accessible . Rodda noted the wooden shutters for the window , the heavy wooden bar that could be dropped to secure the door . It could be snug enough here at nights . A paraffin lamp swung from the ceiling . The furniture had come out of the cottage from which Mrs. Evans had been ejected long ago : a dresser with its china , a table , a couple of kitchen chairs , a settle by the fire , a double bed screened by curtains of clean sacking . For washing , there was a tin bath hanging on hooks near the woodpile , outside . Rodda was as happy as a schoolboy . It was a beautiful day and he was in the company of women . Also , he exulted at having broken down the taboo . He  --  he alone  --  ever since these women had been here , was permitted to enter and be at home . His masculinity was pleased . It had been successful again . It had empowered him where everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two feared , discussed and avoided women . He sawed and planed and chiseled , whistling and singing . Little was said . Mrs. Evans worked on her vegetable plot ; Lucy sat on a bench fixed to the outside wall of the shack , sewing , smiling with quiet happiness , looking out to sea . " A fair picture she be , that li'l maid , " Rodda thought . He had not before noticed how attractive Lucy was . He purposely left his job unfinished , and he was there again the next day . He fixed the chimney shelf , and this time stayed to tea . Lucy , unbidden , had prepared it . Her mother was annoyed , but kept her feelings to herself . She tried to re-establish her position by thanking Eddy for what he had done and asking " How much will that be ? " He laughed boisterously , filled his pipe , and settled down comfortably between the two women on the outside bench . 1 le did n't even bother to answer . Ile laughed , and smoked contentedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave their broken-hearted cries , droopingon the wing , running in the field . " This is a good ole life , " he said , and lazily contemplated the smoke of a steamer moving down channel . When at last he got up , he said : " There 's a lot needs doin ' here , midears . You want a li'l table here in front of the bench , for one thing . It 's daft carrying out this great monster . " And he came and knocked up a table , and brought gravel for the paths between the vegetable beds , and addressed himself to the question of water supply . There were about ten yards of land between the back of the shack and the hedge that divided this field from the next , and under the hedge ran a trickle of water that did not earn the name of stream . But it was pure , and did n't fail , and it had been enough for the women 's needs . Now Rodda must excavate , must bank up with big smooth stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big and deep as a bath , with the trickle running in at one end and out at the other . It was certainlya convenience to be able to dip the largest vessel and have done with it . It was while the acquaintanceship of Rodda and the two women was at this stage that Wesley Rodda met them in Porteven and was rebuffed by Betty . Betty wanted no more people hanging round her home , certainly not young men like Wesley Rodda . It was not in Porteven that Lucy was to meet young men . She did not know that Lucy was already lost. 90 91IoLucy would always remember May and June of that year . It had been mining 01F and on and one May day , toward the end of the afternoon , Eddy Rodda appeared between the showers , and it seemed to her that it was because of him that the weather cleared . He always had an excuse for coming , and this time it was a chicken run . The day darkened again and the rain came back , and he went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain stayed . " I could run for it , " he offered , having no intention of doing anything of the sort , and knowing that to be wet to the skin had never harmed him . No ; this was comfortable , and here he meant to stay , especially now that Mrs. Evans had fastened the shutters , dropped the bar across the door , and lit the lamp . It was cozy with the fire blazing , blue and green and orange flames spurting from the salty driftwood , and Betty busy with a frying pan . The smell of the cooking fish , the rattle of the rain on the tarpaulin , the clatter of cups and plates and cutlery as Lucy laid the supper table : this was all most agreeable , and the sight of that mantel shelf and the other things that his own hands had made gave him a satisfactory proprietorial feeling . He leaned back on the settee , smoking his pipe , expansively at home . The firelight and lamplight fell on the dull gold of his earrings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg through . He had pulled off his woolen cap . The triumph of being intimately here where no other men had been lit him up . Virility seemed to pour out of him . Lucy was disturbingly and deliciously aware of it . The meal was ready and they sat down , the two women on one side and Rodda on the other . The table was narrow and presently Eddy 's knee touched Lucy 's . It was accidental , but fateful . I Ie was aware , looking at the girl whose face was so close to his , that the brief contact both alarmed and excited her ; and what had begun by accident he now pursued with intent . It fascinated him to play this game under Betty 's very eyes . Before long , Lucy 's knees , gripped tight together , were fast between his , and he knew , as he always knew such things , that she was enchanted to have it so . The rain continued to drum upon the roof ; the lamplight fell gently onto the table , and Rodda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , talked and talked . There was no one in Porteven who could talk like Eddy Rodda , no one who had seen the world , East and West , as he had , not even Lord Burnage , and he could carry himself away as readily as he carried his hearers . That is why he was successful as a local preacher . Fifty years later , he would probably have talked politics on a street corner ; but then the chapel and the pub were the only placesthat gave a man a chance ; and so Eddy talked in both . He could describe the Mediterranean shipwrecks of St. Paul in terms of his own experiences so that one almost lived for a moment inside the pages of the New Testament . He was the wonder and the bafflement of the Porteven Methodists . They were aware of his reputation , but he could disarm them by accepting it . To hear him preach from some such text as " Sinners , of whom I am chief " was to suspend judgment . It was not that Eddy Rodda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could weep tears of blood and feel everyone of them welling out of his heart ; but there were tides in him that were irresistible , and that he did not want to resist . Betty Evans , no less than Lucy , listened fascinated when the table had been cleared and they had drawn up to the fire and he began his saga . But it was to Lucy he was now addressing himself , consciously using everything that experience told him would be of service in this case ; and it was Lucy who , when the two women were stretched side by side on the bed , did not sleep but , fearful lest tossing should disturb her mother , perhaps awaken suspicion in her mind , lay rigid upon her back , looking at the unseen ceiling and beyond it the sky full of stars , as she had seen them when , the night having cleared , Rodda went at last , and , as he climbed the gap in the hedge , had seemed a huge shape on the sky , with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always remember of May month ; and of June she would remember hay harvest , and the burning sun and the red poppies and white dog daisies lying in the swathes as the scythes hissed and rasped and a thousand small things scurried and scuttered from the swinging blades . She stood by the fieldgate as the mowers moved slowly forward , and her imagination was filled with the thought of mice and voles that had lived foolish happy lives , making homes under the wind-stirred , flower-starred canopies that had seemed secure and that now were tumbling about them . She had seen a nest of harvest mice after a scythe had passed through it , and now she turned , with a sudden imaginative apprehension of life 's callous inevitability , and looked seaward . The sea was sleeping . Even more than the land , it was deceptive . Now it looked like an immense silken sheet of blue on which one might rest , lulled in security , but devils of rage and fury could rise out of it to shatter and destroy . Of late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her body was tormented with strange unknown desires . She turned to take a last look at the reapers and began to walk to the shack . Her mother had learned to swing a scythe with the best . Tall and leather-browned by the midsummer sun , with a scarlet rag tied about her hair , she moved among the men , taciturn and forbidding . It had been a surprise when she asked for this work , and it had been given to her reluctantly . Butnew ideas were moving in her mind . 1 lithcrtu , she had been content by crafty ways to keep body and soul together for herself and Lucy . Now this was not enou =h . To make something of Lucy , she began to understand , would call for money , and so from now on she would put herself in the way of earning it . She reproached herself that already she had left this late . The girl was seventeen , and Inc tty was quick to perceivesymptoms of restlessness . The restless girl wandered between the June high hedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Campion and ragged robin on either hand gave color amid the yeasty froth of meadowsweet ; and on one side , making the June green richer , slid the trickle of water that soon passed under the hedge , through a little culvert of stones , to fall with hardly a sound into the brimming sunken trough that Eddy Rodda had made . Now , in this high moment of the summer , it was an enchanting place . The end of the hut , with the door in it , the right angle of the two hedges , made it recluse and cool . The dog roses grew freely in that angle , lifting waywardly against the blue sky , and ferns , lusty in the damp , fringed the pool 's edge . The broiling sun had no power here , and a few clumps of late primroses bloomed in the mossy shadowed bank . Lucy stood looking down into the pool . The slight flow set her image wavering in the crystal water . The pool was so newly made that no sediment had yet been carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They gleamed invitingly , and the girl was overcome by a desire to lie in the cool stillness of the water . Never in her life , so far as she could remember , had she immersed herself . Once a week , the tin bath that hung to the outside wall of the shack was dragged within , water was heated , and she and hefty bathed . Rut you could not lie down in the tin bath ; and the pagan thought of lying down in cold water seized upon her now . It was part of the sweet distress that Eddy Rodda was inflicting upon her . She wanted to go naked into his pool . It was the noon of the day and of the year . The reapers were half a mile away ; no one ever came down this byway ; and the angle of the hedge made the bathing place as secluded as a room . It was but a pace or two from the door to the water , along a flagged pathway , and when her naked feet touched the unwanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body she paused for a moment , shivering slightly , her arms folded about her breast . She stood thus , wrapped in her own embrace , her heart beating heavily at her hardihood , thinking of embraces more warm and carnal . Looking up , she could see the sky , cloudless , unbounded , with the untrammeled gulls soaring in the blue gulfs , free as she felt not free , and she longed for life to lift her up , to take her out of her enclosure. 94Rodda lifted her up . She lay upon the water , almost swooning when she saw that he was there , stricken with shame , but so beaten down by joy and terror that she could do nothing . As she had seen him huge against the stars , so now he was huge against the blue-white dazzle of the sky . He bestrid one end of the pool , a foot planted on either side ; then she saw him bend , his great beard coming down toward her face . She was more helpless than a mouse with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she did not want to . Rodda 's earrings were like golden moons falling out of the sky toward her . There was just a moment when she was aware of the face , not laughing as she had been accustomed to see it laugh , but grimly set , and of the dog roses making a fantastic halo about it , and of the sky at which she seemed to be looking through a tilted tunnel ; and then she felt his arms plunged down into the water , his fingers feeling beneath her body , his great strength lifting her out of the pool . She lay upon his chest , dripping ; her head sank upon his shoulder and her eyes closed . he carried her into the house . CIIAA ' 1P , SEVENTHAT day when Maggie Whale received the letter from Charles Dickens , Sally and I left her to discuss certain matters with Father : matters that concerned the future of a number of people : me and Sally , Lucy Evans and her son , whom she regrettably insisted on naming Merlin . Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's concern . They did not live on his land and had no legal claim or claim of custom upon him . But he was never a man to confine his good-doing to the narrowest limits that could be thought of ; and there were two reasons why he showed an especial interest in Lucy Evans . One was his old comradeship with her father , and the other was his liking for that picturesque villain Captain Rodda . By the time it burst upon my notice  --  that is , by the morning when I saw Lucy with her child outside the lodge , and Rodda slinking from sight , and Mrs. Rodda shouting abuse , and Wesley hot in pursuit  --  the situation was indeed one to call for a kindly intervention . I was to know Lucy so well and to hear , in the days to come , so much of this story from her , that I have no difficulty in seeing her that morningflying along the cliff path from the lodge to Porteven with the child bundled in her arms , no difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , till then singularly sheltered and apart from95the normal stress of life , now thrown with one sudden and tremendous impact upon its lively reality . She was deserted , save by the young pursuerwhom she ( lid not want . She had , up to this very moment , persuadedherself that , could she but meet I " , cldy Rodda , her situation would somehow disentangle itself . When it was evident that she was with child he had ceased to appear at the shack , and what was evident to him bv , is soon evident to Mrs. Evans also . " That was a dreadful night . Betty had been away all day . She returned in the evening carrying a long parcel , which she made a mystery of , refusing to open it . She put it aside , and she and the girl sat down to their supper . Betty was in an exceptionally good mood , gay and talkative . They had not had a night like this for a long time , for all through that summer she had found work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help Lucy to become something . Now , with supper over , she began to speak . Shc told Lucy of her ambitions , and the girl saw her mother for the first time not as a reserved , isolated person but as a member of a family . She learned of a sister who had been a barmaid . Betty was amusing and informative on the wonderful openings a barmaid had . She met all sorts , some of them real gents , and with a girl who knew what she was up to , that could lead to something good . With her sister , it had led to marriage with a commercial traveler in drapery goods , a man with his head screwed on right , who had , ten years ago , managed to start his own draper 's shop in Swansea . It was to Lucy wonderful , miraculous . Relatives who owned a draper 's shop ! She could hardly conceive such grandeur , and her mother chuckled at the greater surprise she had up her sleeve . Mostyn Lloyd  --  that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Swansea was not big enough for him . London was what he had always wanted . And now it had come . 1 le was to open a London shop ! Betty , usually taciturn , talked and talked . She had been storing up too much for too long . All through this summer , ever since the thought had come to her that something practical must now be done about Lucy , she had been worming her way into the citadel . 1ler first letter to Meg Mostyn Lloyd had not been warmly answered , but that it was answeredat all encouraged her to go on . Gradually some of the old friendlinesshad come back , and now this ! It was not tremendous , but it seemed so to Betty . The Mostyn Lloyds had no children . When they were settled in London they would be willing to have Lucy with them to see how she shaped . Mostyn Lloyd himself condescended to write , because he did n't want any misunderstanding . Lucy must do as she was told . She must be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were required . It might have sounded to anyone else like bargainingfor the services of a cheap servant , but not to Betty . She was satis-96fled that Lucy , once established , would be irresistible . Already she was seeing her as the heiress in that childless home . And now , the supper being cleared away , and the shack locked up for the night , and the lamp lit , she at last unwrapped her parcel . It had cost her all that her hard labor had earned that year . She had tramped to the neighboring town and back to get these things , and now she spread them on the table , running her leathery hand over them lovingly : the bonnet and the dress , the petticoats and stockings , the shoes , gloves and underclothing . There was even an absurd frivolous parasol . Meg Mostyn Lloyd should see that Betty 's life had not been in vain . " Put them on ! " she cried eagerly . Lucy put them on . She stood there under the lamp in all those frills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forearms while her mother , laughing with delight , tied the bonnet strings beneath her chin in a fetching bow . She stood hack and looked at the girl . If Porteven could see her now ! She 'd show ' cm ! She handed her the parasol . " Put it up ! " Lucy was in a daze at what was happening to her . It had been a long lonely day , very hot , and now , with all time air shut out , and the fire burning , because it had been necessary to cook the supper , and with the smell of the frying-pan fat in her nostrils , she felt suddenly vertiginousand queasy . " Put it up ! " her mother repeated . Lucy dully opened the parasol and sloped it back over her right shoulder . And there she was : the product , complete at last , that her mother had worked so hard to attain . But she saw that mother , standing on the other side of the room and looking at her with an artist 's ecstasy , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff or the sand on the shore when a day was over-hot . The parasol slipped from her hand . She clutched the edge of the table and her stomach heaved . A little vomit dribbled down her chin on to her flounces . Betty was rooted to the ground for a moment by her consternation . Then she leapt with fury in her eyes . She picked up the frivolous parasol and folded it , and beat Lucy with it about the head and shoulders . " My God ! " she cried . " You little bitch you ! You dirty little bitch ! " 2The woman 's fury lasted only for a moment . It was a fury engendered not so much by the girl 's mischance as by Betty 's own personal sense of frustration . She felt as though someone had put a foot through a picture at the very moment when she had known that it was to be hung on the line . There was jealousy in it , too . Betty did not need to be told who97was responsible for this . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had endured so long . AU these emotions , rushinginto the void where her cozy dream had lived , clashed in an awful but brief co motion and fell in blow after blow upon Lucy 's body . The girl had sunk to the floor , annihilated by this onslaught , as much destroyed as some image that had lived in a niche might be had its worshiper turned suddenly upon it , and it been sentient . Betty herself sank into a chair , breathing hard , recovering a stony composure , looking at the white-faced creature groveling among the stylish flounces . Then , saying nothing , she undressed and got into bed . She heard the swish and crackle of the silks falling off the girl , and presently Lucy crept in beside her . They lay apart , and neither slept . There were no more blows or reproaches , nothing but a sullen and obstinate dedication such as a hard-faced wardress might give to a fragile ' prisoner . There was only one thing to remind Lucy of that terrible night . Waking from uneasy sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the bed . The window had been flung up and the early sun was streaming in . Lucy walked weakly to the window and looked out , and there was her mother touching a match to the clothes that had been gathered from the floor . The girl saw the blue flounced skirt , the white petticoats , the violet gloves , the many-colored flowers in the gay streamered bonnet making a bright splash on the edge of the field . Evidently the things had been saturated in paraffin , for at the touch of the match they flamed furiously and Betty 's dream danced skyward like a sudden flight of fiery birds . To Lucy it was as terrible a moment as any . She crawled , chilled , back into bed and did not stir till her mother was at her side , a hand on her shoulder . " Here 's a cup o ' tea . " She took up from that moment all her old service , but she did it with a grim and obvious resolution , a self-accusing persistence , that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may be sure , kept his mouth shut , and Betty saw to it that no one else came near the shack . She was forever encountering Wesley , wandering sheepishly in the precincts , and frightening him with her gruff " Be off with you . " She herself , when the moment came , delivered the child , and still no news of what had happened reached anyone in Porteven . It was at three o'clock on a mad March morning , with the wind rushing off the sea , over the roofs of Porteven , and shaking the timbers of the shack , that the child was born ; and with the first flat light of day , the wind having died , Lucy lay in a great stillness and heard the crying of lambs coming out of the fields . It was so weak and forlorn and defenselessa crying that Lucy stirred in the bed and pulled the child to her , and her mother , who had been huddled over the fire , got up and said gruffly : " Oh , you 're awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 98The weather remained cold and still , and at intervals throughout the day Lucy could hear , coming from the enclosure where Rodda had made the bath , the sound of hammering : sharp , persistent , and somehowterrifying , as though a coffin were being made out there . As the daylight was dying , Betty dragged through the door an ungainly rude cradle on rockers that she had made from driftwood . She put it near the hearth and the firelight filled it and she sat down looking at it , testingthe rockers with a gentle motion of her calloused hand , and suddenlydissolved in tears . Lucy looked at her from the bed , full of love for her and full of sorrow , and said , rallying her , " Mother , do n't cry . It 's better than I thought . I thought it was a coffin . " Betty got up , wiping her eyes with her sack apron . " Well , " she said dourly , " when you know all , there 's not much to choose between them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , things might be worse . There are three of us now instead of two , and that seems to be all that 's happened . Indeed , in many ways life was lovely . She had made a good recovery and the child was lusty . March had stepped over into April and there were ravishing blue and white days with the larks singing and the leaf buds green on the hawthorns . True , her mother 's oppressivetaciturnity continued . She did all that needed to be done , never stirring far from the shack . She knitted and sewed for the child . There was a different collection of things to be assembled now from those that had flamed in the field . There was still the question of the moment that could not forever be avoided : the moment when this child must be seen by the world . Lucy did not know it , but that was a moment her mother did not intend to face . Betty had intended to show Porteven what such a woman as she could make of a daughter . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show a fallen idol . And so , on the morning when the child was a month old , Lucy awoke to find that her mother was absent . She was not at first alarmed by this , but when she got out of bed she saw on the table a cocoa tin that she had known all her life . Use had rubbed it to a high shine . It was Betty 's money box . Where it was hidden Lucy did not know . It appeared at moments of crisis , when Betty would count her savings to see whether she could do this or that . Then it would disappear again into some secret place . Now there it was , placed where she was intended to see it , and she pulled off the lid , aware that she was frightened by the significance of the box appearing in this way . She shook out onto the table three gold sovereigns , a few shillings , a lot of pence and ha'pence . There was nothing else , no message , except the obvious message of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the last I can do for you . " The proud woman had no use for failure , and she did not intend to stand by and endure the knowledge that the people she had always99flouted were laughing ; in their sleeves . She was well able to look after herself , and now Lucy could learn to do the same . All this Lucy well understood , standing by the table with the worn tin box in her hand and the coins scattered beneath her tears. 3 " I do n't want you to come till I 'm properly settled in , " Whaley had said . Old Man Bennetts was gone from the lodge by the lake and here Maggie Whale was establishing herself , with Lucy Evans for her maid and young Merlin spending most of his time lying in the sun on a blanket on the lawn . This was how Father had dealt with Lucy 's problem . The girl was quite unfit to live like her mother by her own resources . Since Betty 's disappearance , things with her had gone from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Curnow and a few neighbors and making constant raids , with the child in her arms , toward Eddy Rodda 's lodge . Eddy always managed to disappear , and Wesley , whose infatuation had been deepened by the girl 's misfortune , would follow her along the cliff and through the village , providing a public entertainment that Father thought had better come to an end . When I saw Lucy on my first morning at Tresant , there had been nothing but a back retreating before Mrs. Rodda 's vituperation . Now I was able to look at her closely . Sally and I , informed that the time for beginning lessons had arrived , walked to Maggie Whale 's lodge on a June morning . It was customary to Sally , but to me all new . When we got there , I could not but stand and stare . The footpath to the big house ran in front of the cottage garden , and on the other side of this footpath was the lawn that sloped clown to the boathouse , with the lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills on the other side . The water lilies were out now , growing so densely that they made islands colored with red and creamy flowers , resting like cups upon the dark green saucers of leaves stained with burgundy-crimson . We turned at Whaley 's voice , and there she was coming through the granite porch of the cottage . " Well , " she asked , " do n't you think I 'm lucky to have a place like this ? " She was . We stood for a moment in her small garden . There was no sound that was not enchanting : the June drone of insects , the calling of birds . Across the water we could see men swinging their scythes in a field on the hill . " Come in , " Whaley said . We went into the cool solid cottage . Whaley had turned the room on the right of the entrance passage into her workroom . It was whitewashedand had little in it save her books , a table with a writing chair , I00and an easy chair by the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace was the only picture in the room : a portrait of a woman painted in pale colors . " That 's Mrs. Undridge ! " I exclaimed . " Yes , " said Whaley . " It reached me the other day : a present from the Undridges for having looked after Daniel last winter . I do n't as a rule like Mr. Undridge 's pictures , but this is not bad . " Certainly , it was not bad at all . " There 's a letter from them , " Maggie Whale added . " They apologize for landing the boy on us , but explainthat Mrs. Undridge was expecting a baby when we descended on them . I do n't see why they could n't have told me at the time . Anyhow , they thought it would be a good idea to have Daniel out of the way till things settled down again . Now he has a sister named Marie . " Well , it was that morning that I took stock of Lucy Evans . Maggie Whale must have been a remarkable person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthinkable that one should employ a servant without dressing her up in uniform . But this girl was not in uniform , nor did Whaley ever , so far as I know , call her a servant . She said to me that morning : " Sarah , this is Lucy Evans who is sharing the lodge with me . That 's her son out there kicking on the grass . We call him Merlin , and he 's certainly a wizard . " I found myself shaking hands with a cowlike girl wearing such clothes as any girl might wear in summer in the country . When I call Lucy cowlike I am not being rude but complimentary . After all , Hera was called oxeyed ; and the sort of cow Lucy made me think of was one of those slim beautifully-colored Guernseys whose eyes are enormous , trustful and velvety . Lucy was utter docility and placidity . Maggie could n't have charge of any young person , in any capacity , without applying her own methods of education , adapted to the case . " What on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said later , " except be a friend to her ? She was so helpless . All her life long her mother had been her servant . She was the most pampered little thing you ever met . And then the bottom fell out of it all . She was in a dreadful state when she came to me . To have treated her like a menial , ordering her to do things she had never done in her life , would have made her sullen and useless . At the same time , I had no intention of going on as that fool of a woman had done and treating her like a doll . So we did everything together , the cleaning and the cooking and our little bit of gardening , and all the rest of it . We always had meals together . The only thing is , " Maggie grinned , " that I never helped with the feeding of Master Merlin , and Lucy never helped with the writing . " IOI4All through that summer , down at Tresant we went about in a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merlin in a pram that we took turns to push , and Sally and I became accustomed to seeing Lucy , sitting under a hedge or on a log by the lake , bare her breast and feed the child . We would watch fascinated and count it a privilege to be permitted , when he was full , to wipe away the milky dew that hung on the wet bud of his mouth . Merlin gave little trouble . He was as placid as his mother . Or , with a meal in a hamper , we would all get into the punt and paddle about among the water lilies , and eat our meal on the shore of some small bay of the lake , with the child lying on a blanket and Lucy languidly fanning the flies from his face with a burdock leaf . Then I would take my swimming lesson from Sally , who was like a fish in the water . There were lessons given in Maggie Whale 's own fashion . Our habit was to eat breakfast at the house and then to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten , and from then till one o'clock we would have lessons either in the cottage or on the lawn by the boathouse . We read and drew and wrote little essays and chattered , either in English or bad French , though in time we got to read French well enough ; but the main thing , as I remember it , was that we learned to like to read . Once you have done that , it is as though you had learned to like walking . All territories are open to you . Lucy Evans joined us in our lessons . She could read and write as well as we could . It was she , of all people , who introduced Malory into our reading . She had a battered copy of the Morte d'Arthur that her mother had given her , and where Betty Evans had picked that up goodness knows . From it Lucy had taken the name Merlin for her son . I remember dearly a morning when the summer was fully advanced  --  it must have been in August  --  and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , passing the book from hand to hand and reading in turns . Suddenly , Lucy was gone . Without a word , picking up the baby , she fled into the lodge . It was my turn to read . Lying on my stomach , with my hands cupping my chin , and the book on the grass before me , I was at once kicking my heels in the air and reading , when Whaley rose to her feet , saying : " Just a moment , Sarah . " I stopped and got up , and then I saw that Lucy and the child were gone . And coming toward us , looking pale and worried , swinging a straw frail in his hand , was Wesley Rodda . We all knew that there was trouble in the Rodda household . On Saturdays and Sundays there were no lessons , and Sally and I , on our ponies or afoot , wandered the countryside . Some time before thisIO2apparition of Wesley at Maggie 's lodge , we had been walking in the country behind Porteven when Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Lucy had for so long lived . We wandered down the lane , climbed through the gap in the hedge , and to our surprise ran into Wesley Rodda . He was sitting moodily on the bench outside the shack , gazing at the glittering sea . Even to us two children , there was something so smitten and dejected in his air , his hands hangingbetween his knees , his shoulders bowed , that we felt a surge of pity , and Sally cried : " Hallo , Wesley ! What 's the matter with you ? " IIe heaved himself up with a sigh and denied what was obvious . " Matter , Miss Sally ? Why , there be nothing the matter . A bit lonesomep'raps , here all by myself . " We thought he was speaking of the passing loneliness of the day and place ; but he went on : " Well , what about a cup o ' tea , seem ' you 're here ? I 'll have it ready in a minute . " He flung open the door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not living here , Wesley ? " " Ay , that I be , " he said emphatically . " Blessed is the man that walketh not in the way of the ungodly . I 'll walk with him no longer . No , not I. " That was how we learned that Wesley was not living with his parents , and the rest of it soon came to our ears . Poor Mrs. Rodda , distraught between her two men , was now with the one , now the other , cooking and cleaning , trying to mend a situation that had passed beyond repair . When the fishing boat Sally Gaylord went out , Eddy and Wesley were still her crew , but they said in Porteven that , beyond what was necessary to the task in hand , those two spoke never a word to one another . When they came in they would part , one to walk to the lodge , one to the shack , and sometimes Mrs. Rodda would be there to meet them , and she would be distracted , not knowing which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , to meet our unexpectedvisitor . " Good morning , Wesley , " she cried . " A bit off your beat , are n't you ? " He opened the frail he was carrying . " Good morning , Miss , " he said . " I thought maybe you could do with a bit o ' fresh fish . Caught'n myself . A good ole bass . " He had paused where she had met him , and there was a sense that she was blocking the way . " Why , thank you , " she cried . " It 's most kind of you . Sarah , will you take this into the kitchen and bring back the frail ? " I did so , and there was no sign of Lucy and the child anywhere in the house . When I returned with the frail the situation was uneasy . Neither Maggie nor Wesley had anything to say . They were just103silently confronting one another . She gave him the frail and then took his : um and hey:m to walk in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be led off like a good but disappointed and rather sullen child . When they were out of earshot , I could see that 1'h , ala N , was talking to him earnestly , still holding his arm and keelai1t Nina moving . Then she loosed him , and stood watching till his sad lonely figure was out of sight . She came back , and her voice trembled a little as she said : " Now , you two . Amuse yourselves for a hit , " and she almost ran into the cottage . The perspicacious Sally said : " She 'll be back when she 's had her cry out . " 5From time to time we had news from my father and mother in London ; then they went on to stay with friends in Scotland ; and soon now they would be back in Tresant . " We shall , I fear , miss being with you on your birthday , " Father wrote to Sally , " but we shall try to make up for that when we return , and I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good time . " We gave ourselves a very different time from any that he could have expected . It was on a Saturday in September that Sally and I were riding our ponies along that path through the wood and beside the lake which I had followed on my first morning at Tresant . Tomorrow would be her birthday . She was putting on a good pretense of being reconciled to Father 's absence , but this was the first time , save for those years when he was in the Crimea , that they had spent the birthday apart . She decreed that there must he no celebration of any sort until his return : then we would have a retrospective birthday party . And so as we rode through the wood we were keeping this matter out of our minds . It was one of the still days that come at that season . Everything had ceased to grow but had not yet begun to fall . The sky 's blue was hazed and milky and the lake was untroubled by a ripple . We ambled along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I potter ; and then we were suddenly thrown into our adventure by a coincidence . At the very spot where , on my first walk there , I had seen a stoat run across the path , we saw one run that morning . It disappeared into the self-same bushes at the foot of the shaly cliff , and instantly my mind went back to that other occasion . I pulled up my pony and said : " I wonder whether that 's the same stot ? " Sally and I liked using these patois words . " The same as what ? " she asked . I told her of that day 's happening . " And when I began to poke I04about in the bushes , I looked up , and there was Captain Rodda : up there on top , among the pine trees . You remember ? We came on together and found you and Whaley sitting on the wall . " " Yes . We 'd been there a long time , and I wondered how Captain Rodda had got past without being seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , but he seems to think he can do as he likes . " " Everything was strange to me then , " I said , " and I may have been mistaken ; but I had a feeling that he did n't like me poking into those bushes . He came sliding down from the trees and almost carried me off . " " He 's capable of anything , " said Sally . " I 've heard Father say so : ' That old pirate is capable of anything . ' " We had dismounted and tied the ponies to trees . " Let 's have a look , " Sally suggested . " It would n't surprise me to ( inch him up to some-thing . " She parted the thick growth of hazel and hushed through . " Hold back the bushes , " she called over her shoulder . I slid so , and Sally squirmed farther forward . " There 's a hole --  a cave of sorts , " she said . I let the bushes fall behind me and followed her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big man like Captain Eddy would have had to crouch . We found ourselves in a rock passage . It was dark , and we could tell what was about us only by touch . This revealed a ceiling just above our heads and rock walls about a yard apart . I was rather frightened in there in the dark , but I pressed on behind Sally , who went forward for about a dozen yards and then said : " I ca n't feel the roof any more , or the sides . It 's a sort of rock chamber . " It was : not large , but , as we discovered , exploring with our hands , roughly circular . Presently Sally 's foot kicked something and there was a clinking sound . She bent down and said " Bottles ! " While she was doing this I stepped past her in the darkness , still feeling the walls , and moved into another passage like the one we had come through . " We can get out here , I think , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right . Lead on . I 'm bringing a bottle . " We emerged into the woods , pushing aside a thick curtain of ivy and old man 's beard . Standing away and looking back at it , you would never guess what lay behind , for it made a small part of a cascade of this stuff falling down the side of a low acclivity a hundred yards along . Sally sat down , holding the bottle , and began to laugh . " The old fox ! " she said . " A bolt-hole either end ! What a marvelous place ! " " But what 's it for ? " I asked innocently . " To dodge the revenue men , " she said and laughed again . " Father 's a magistrate . Would n't it be fun to blow the gaff and have Eddy Rodda up before him for smuggling ? " I05Now I began to understand . I had heard of smugglers . " But we could n't get him , " said Sally . " We could n't prove a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything anyway . But I 'm sure Father guesses what he 's up to . I remember a time when Eddy came back from France and Father said : What makes the fish so much letter over there , Eddy ? ' and Eddy grinned and said : They smell better , my lord , and keep a bit of heart in you on cold nights . ' " She fondled the bottle and added : " And so they do . Do you remember the hot red wine we used to drink with Whaley at Montreuil ? " Yes , I did ; but what I did n't know , or Sally either , was that Whaley had seen to it that our " wine " was warm water , mildly colored . We both allowed our minds to dwell on those agreeable outings to the Cafe de l'Agriculture , with the hot food and the warm drink and the stove blinking its red eye ; and suddenly Sally said : " Let 's have a birthday party in the cave tomorrow ! Just the two of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 'll be plenty to drink . " Alas ! how true that was ! 6 We took a basket into the fruit garden and picked pears and peaches from the espaliered walls . We scrounged cakes from the kitchen , and surreptitiously acquired two cups . We snatched a lantern from the stables and we set off . It was about four o'clock . There was no reason why we should not have said that we were going to have a picnic in a cave that we had discovered , but somehow the adventure began in this spirit of furtiveness that changed to bravado once we were well away and walking along the path through the wood . There Sally began to sing in a loud voice some lines she had found goodness knows where : Belly and back go bare , go bare , Hand and foot go cold , So long as I have good wine enough , Whether it be new or old . " We are going to fall into terrible temptation , " she announced , " It will be Whaley 's fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was running ahead , swinging the lantern , and I plodded behind , carrying the heavier basket . She looked back and urged me on . " Come along ! " she cried . " We are going to carouse , and you must learn my song . I never liked a dolorous drinker . " Io6 However , I did not find it easy to come up to her reckless mood . It was not so long ago that I had been living in Portman Square , with every moment of my life supervised , every word I uttered watched . I could n't take so easily to singing aloud in the woods about bare bellies . I remembered how my curiosity about belly buttons had produced a tremendous storm . And , incidentally , had produced Whaley , too . " Do n't you think , " I shouted , " we should have let Miss Whale know where we were going ? " Sally waited for me to catch up . " Miss Whale , " she said , " is no doubt glad to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she has her own life to think of . Perhaps she 's writing a story for Mr. Dickens . " We were soon in the cavern . Sally struck a match and lit the candle in the lantern . We were able now to see just what the place came to , and for one thing we saw that we need n't have brought a lantern at all . There was one hanging from a hook in the roof . Sally lit that , too . It was a roughly circular chamber , high enough for a man to stand upright in , and a big man , standing in the middle , could almost have touched the walls on either side . It was perfectly dry , but cold . It contained nothing but the lantern , a lot of corked bottles , and a small wooden keg with a spigot . Sally looked around her with satisfaction . " The smuggler 's lair ! " she exclaimed . " Well , we must make ourselves comfortable . We shall need something to lie on . Come with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the woods . The bracken was still green . We pulled up armfuls of it and carried it in . A summer storm had torn some branches from the pines , and these , too , we took into the cavern . They would only just go through the narrow passage . We hauled , and they swished behind us like peacocks ' tails . With these laid against the wall and the bracken piled on them , we could recline  --  " like odalisques , " said the imaginative Sally . We laid on the floor in front of us the paper in which our provisionswere wrapped and spread out the feast . " It is rather cold , " said Sally . " We must warm ourselves with wine . " We did not know that brandy was the only wine in this cache . It was fortunate  --  or was it disastrous ?  --  that some of the brandy was in the wooden keg , for we had not thought of bringing a corkscrew , and anyway I doubt if either of us would have had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there it was . Nothing need be done but turn the tap of the spigot . Sally did so and filled our cups to the brim . We sat there side by side , each holding a cup and Sally 's eyes were dancing . " Your very good health , my dear sister , " she said , with a grave inclination of the head , and we both drank . We drank as though what we held was cold spring water on a thirsty day , and with one accord we put the cups down on the floor and looked at one another . Our throats were burning ; we gasped . Ian " This is strong wine , " said Sally , " stronger than we had in Montreuil . " She had come late to Montreuil . She had joined in only one of our expeditions to the Cafe de 1'Agric u l i u n . I , who had known them all , agreed that it was strong wine . W11 ; ilcy I1. d never given us anything like this . " It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We must treat it with respect . " Our sensible inclination was to treat it with complete disavowal , to leave it there in the cups , but this was a birthday party and valor overcame discretion . We ate our fruit and cake , and as we ate we occasionally moistened our lips with a discreet sip . liken that way , it was not so repulsive ; and presently Sally began to giggle . " This is excellent tipple , " she said . " I must ask Captain Rodda to give me the name of his wine merchant . " We had eaten all the food . I was not feeling cold now , and the cavern , with these branchy couches and the soft light of the lanterns , was even cozy . It seemed an excellent place for a sleep , and I wanted to sleep . Sally had become remote , and I hardly knew what she was talking about as she proposed that we should presently walk in to Porteven and attend evening service at the Methodist Chapel . She said she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet Captain Eddy . We should be able to thank him for his hospitality . And go there we did . That was the utterly disastrous end of this altogether disastrous afternoon . We did n't go at once . The desire for sleep was too much for me . Those discreet sips had mounted up , and , added to our first indiscreet swig , they had me lying full length , watching Sally lie down beside me ; and presently I was in an unreal , uneasy sleep in which I could hear herb uttering and feel her stirring restlessly at my side . When I came to , one of the lanterns had burned out . The cavern was rather dark and I felt cold . My head ached . Sally was sitting up , rubbing her eyes and yawning . I felt dreadful and she looked dreadful . I even began to cry . " Let 's go home . 1 want to go to bed . " Sally was in a terrible dogged mood . " Co if you want to , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going there appeared to obsess her . She said nothing more but scrambled through one of the passageways . I followed , unable to face the thought of going home alone . We were on the pathwaywhere I had seen the stoat running . The evening was darkeningtoward sunset , and when we came onto the cliff path that led to Porteven all the western sky was a smother of mauves and lilacs and the dusk was marching over the water . It was a gorgeous and melancholy moment , and it made me feel so small and sick andro8lonely that I began to cry again . Sally was going ahead of me with a strange tottering walk that I was aware was afflicting me too . Presently she was approaching the doors of the repellent little gray-painted chapel . I hurried to catch up with her , and to hurry made me feel sicker than ever . I caught at her arm , and we went in together . The sleep that the brandy had put on us had made us very late . The service was ending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place had been filled with people . In Porteven and thereabout at that time Methodist chapels were filled . All these people had made the place hot , and the burning of oil lamps had made it hotter , and as I went in I was struck by a blast of fetid air that made my stomach heave anew . I rediscovered all the sensations that had bedeviled the end of my voyage in the Sally Gaylord . The noise did n't help . The congregation was singing the final hymn : We think ourselves sincere ; But show us , Lord , is every one Thy real worshipper ? and this was a verse that Sally liked afterward to declaim , with great emphasis on " re-al worshippeer . " At the time , it was no laughing matter . Wesley Rodda was in the pulpit , the light of a lamp that hung above his head falling upon his pale uplifted face . Mrs. Rodda was pedaling away sturdily at the harmonium , and Eddy was there as large as life , his earrings swinging and a hearty braying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the only three I knew , but Sally must have known them all , and they her . At our entrance heads were turned and I was aware of astonished looks as the fact became known that the Honorable Sally Gaylord and her stepsister had favored the chapel with their presence . Our appearance must have deepened the astonishment . We were disheveled and glassy-eyed . Moreover , Sally all this time had been carrying the kitchen basket and a lantern . We stood between the wall and the rearmost pitch-pine seats . There was no room anywhere to sit down . When the hymn was ended , Wesley pronounced the benediction , the door behind us was thrown open , and people began to stream out . I was jostled by the crowd , and this jostling was my final undoing . I was revoltingly sick on the chapel floor . I was not aware of much then except misery and shame till Captain Rodda put his arms round me and carried me through the door . This opened upon the street , and there amid a staring interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetically sick at my side . She was using the kitchen basket , as a sick but good-mannered109horse might use his nose hag . It must have been a great evening for Porteven , and what would have happened to us I do n't know if Dr. Curnow had not chanced to pass by . He was a bachelor and his house was but a stone 's throw away . He gave us one glance , then picked up Sally and moved off with her , Eddy Rodda following with inc . Five minutes later we were lying side by side in a large bed warmed by bricks wrapped in flannel , our stomachs already feeling soothed by something the doctor had given us to drink . I think it must have been opiate as well as sedative , for we were soon asleep . CHAPTER EIGHTT REMEMBER how Father , when we left Montreuil , gave a 1 brooch to our maidservant , whom he had not seen before and was not likely to see again ; and I remember how , when he came home that autumn , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver . There was something for each of us : for Whaley splendid sheets of quarto paper ; for Sally a workbasket , silken lined , which she loved with a passion as great as her apparent resolve never to use it ; for me a useless lovely bauble , a silver-gilt bird with ruby eyes ; for Lucy attractive materials that she could make into clothes . And then , when I thought that that was all , out came Merlin 's rattle . Who else would have remembered little Merlin ? Oh , how I loved him ! Lucy 's face was radiant as she jangled the pretty silver bells . All these presents were unpacked in Whaley 's cottage . On the day after his return , Father had walked down there with Sally and me . Mother had not come . She looked beautiful and happy , but from this time of her return she did not go out much , and not at all in the afternoons . She rested . Sally said : " I expect she 's going to have a baby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unpacking ceremony , and then the four of us sat on the lawn by the lake . It was late autumn , but still warm enough . And now the dread story of our drunkenness came out . It was like Whaley , I thought , to lose no time and to tell of the whole matter frankly and simply . When she had finished , Father said to Sally : " Where did you find this stuff ? " This was something we had told no one . Dr. Curnow had asked us and Whaley had asked us , but we had held our tongues . However , IIOwe had decided between ourselves that , if Father asked us , we would tell . And now Sally did so . All that Father said then was : " We will go into the matter tomorrow . Sally and Sarah , say nothing of this to your mother . Miss Whale , please be at the house at ten in the morning . " I remembered that he was a magistrate ; he was magisterial now , and we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would have preferred a fiery outburst . The joys of the present-giving evaporated . It was a subdued column of three that trailed behind him on the following morning . He must have been thinking things over , for he stopped and asked when we came up with him : " You say you brought away the lantern that was in the cave . Where is it now ? " We did n't know . Sally did n't remember taking it with her when we went to Dr. Curnow 's . " A pity , " he grumbled and strode ahead again . Certainly , it had not returned to the cave . We saw that as soon as we got there . Father hung up the lantern he had brought . The one we had picked up in the stables was hanging from its hook , and that was all that the cave contained . ' l he bottles were gone , and so were the branchy beds we had lain on . Sally and I exclaimed in surprise , and for the first time since hearing our story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " he asked , " that the old fox would have done nothing in all this time ? " I can imagine what the magisterial mind was thinking . No bottles ; no lantern ; no evidence . Of course , these two children could swear to the bottles and to the kind of lantern , and there are plenty of people who know that a lantern of that kind belongs to Eddy Rodda . But I certainly do n't intend to ask these two to give evidence in a public court , and even if Eddy were convicted , he would merely find another hiding place . Besides , he might have added to himself with a grin , I 've bought the stuff from Rodda myself . Cornishmen never took a harsh view of a smuggler . So we put out the lantern and went back to the pathway beside the lake and wandered on in the direction of Eddy 's lodge . We met him there , gazing out to sea ; and he and Father exchanged polite greetings . Eddy hoped that his lordship had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and Father inquired about Mrs. Rodda and Wesley . Then we began to walk back the way we had come and Father kept Eddy in conversation , so that he had to walk with us . When we were near my stot hole , Father shouted to us children , who had gone ahead : " Here , you two ! Here 's something I brought from London for you . " We looked back and saw him tossing a rubber ball from hand to hand . This surprised us : it was such a childish thing , not at all the IIIsort of gift lie would bring ; but he shouted : " Here you are ! " and threw the ball . It did n't reach us , but went into the bushes that hid the passage . We ran to retrieve it , but he shouted : " You 'll scratch yourselves there . Let me get it , " and a moment later he was calling over his shoulder : " Ilallo ! There 's quite a passageway here ! " And that is how all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave . Eddy struck a match and exclaimed coolly : " Looks as if someoneuses this li ' 1 ole place . Here 's a lantern . " And then , with amazement : " One o ' your lordship 's , too , by the look of ' n . Now who 's up to what , I wonder ? " Father looked around him . " Another way out here , " he said , and made his way through . " It leads into the woods , " he reported , returningpresently . He and Rodda looked at one another without a blink . " It would be a bandy place for a smuggler , " Father said . Rodda glanced appraisingly round . " Made for it , " he admitted . But I ca n't imagine , " he added with grave deference , " that anyone knowing your lordship would do such a thing on your lordship 's land . " " No , " Father answered . " Of course , there 's no evidence at all that it 's used for such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offender comes from far afield . Anyway , when you 're about the woods at night you might keep your eyes open . " " Me about the woods at night ! Your lordship ! " " My dear Rodda , " said Father blandly , " I 'm suggesting nothing except that you might be in the habit of taking an occasional moonlightstroll like the rest of us . " " I spend nights enough on the water . When I 'm ashore there 's my ole bed an ' I like to get into'n . " " That 's a sensible fellow , I wish everybody was as wise . " We said good-by to Eddy on the path , and as we walked homeward Father said : " Well , we 've frightened him , off that , but he 'll find another place . I 'm afraid that 's all it comes to . " Ile added presently : " Now , Sally and Sarah , run ahead . 1 wish to speak privately with Miss Whale . " The consequence of this talk was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A groom was always behind us when we rode and Whaley with us when we walked . Whether the desperate affair ever reached Mother 's ears I do not know . She said nothing about it , 2However , Porteven said a great deal about it , following a sermon by Wesley Rodda . Wesley , like everyone else , knew who was the II2father of Lucy Evans 's child . The little scene on the quay at Brest was enough to show anyone how Wesley suffered at sight of his father 's ways , and now that those ways so poignantly involved himself he sat in his hut overlooking Porteven , brooding upon Eddy 's sins like a prophet brooding over the wickedness of all mankind . He had always been considered queer ; now he became exalt-6 . His slow-moving mind remembered the lantern which he had seen in Sally 's hand and ponderously in time connected it with the smuggling operations which he knew his father engaged in . How could he not know , seeing that the stuff came aboard under his eyes ? But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Scriptures warned him that strong drink was raging , and he would not touch it . Once he was convinced that Eddy was concerned in this new outrage , all that he had suffered on account of Lucy Evans swelled like a flood behind his determination to denounce his father ; and he did so in a sermon on the text : " Whoso shall cause one of these little ones to stumble , it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea . " We learned of this from the young groom who rode with us , a devout attendant at the Porteven chapel . Even Wesley in the mood that held him could not bring himself to mention his father by name , but no one doubted what was in the young preacher 's mind or that the little ones who had been caused to stumble were Lucy Evans , Sally and myself . What Eddy Rodda 's thoughts were on hearing himself denounced , I can not say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate the sermon did not " convert " him . He never was a smuggler on the grand scale  --  on the scale of those who made a business of it and accumulated large profits . But he could not resist the temptation to buy brandy cheap a few dozen bottles now and then taken aboard a mile or so off the French coast  --  and to sell it here and there about Porteven . And so it happened when that autumn passed into winter . It was still dark when the Sally Gaylord approached the harbor . But she did not sail into it . She made for the long beach to the east , and Eddy paddled quietly ashore in the dinghy . He concealed his bottles in a cleft of the rocks which he had always used for this purpose . It would serve till he could remove them to a safer , more permanent hiding place . But that was something he had not yet found . He rowed back to the ship . The tide was rising . By the time it was light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand . He made out to sea then , and innocently sailed into harbor with the dawn . That was a Saturday morning . In the course of the day Eddy had decided where to hide the bottles . The simplicity of the idea must113have amused him . The next night he was missing from the Methodist chapel . Wesley was " planned , " as the Methodists say , to preach at a chapel a few miles away , and so the coast was clear . Captain Rodda placed his bottles in the bath that he had dug for Betty Evans , the bath from which he had lifted Lucy , and he covered them with a layer of ' gravel . By the morning , you would see nothing but the clear water lying upon the pebbles . You see , there was nothing romantic about Captain Rodda 's smuggling . It did not make a story of mules struggling up cliff paths , curses and shots in the night , and all the rest of it . It was not a business : it was the outcome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of pocket money while doing so . But it had unfortunate consequences all the same . The next day was clear and sunny : the sort of day when Wesley 's hermit life was not so bad . There was no need to pity him : he was a person with an inclination to solitude . He came out in mid-morning to fill a kettle at the bath and stood there listening to the lisp of the water over the sill and watching the play of light on the gravel . His eye was caught by a blue flash among the white and yellow stones . For a moment he thought nothing of this ; then suddenly he knew what it was . He had seen it often enough : a big turquoise from the barbaric earrings that his father habitually wore . He took a stick and tried to flick it out of the water , but succeeded only in sinking it deeper . He went indoors , put on his long sea boots , and rolled his shirt sleeves above his elbows . Then he came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , searching among the gravel , and , disturbing this , he disclosed a bottle . Soon he had them all out , and the turquoise , too . If he had been able to take a rational view of the matter , it would have been better for him ; but his mind became obsessed by his own interpretation of what had happened . ' Phis was his father 's revenge for the sermon he had preached . ' ' he brandy had been " planted " on him , and no doubt the revenue officials would be privily informed where to find it . All alone up there in the shack above the village , he must have spent a morbid day , going over and over in his mind the events that had begun on the morning when Lucy Evans smiled on him in Porteven and that had now reached this dreadful end . He emptied most of the brandy into a ditch , but two bottles he kept as a token of his discovery . That night he carried them down to Eddy 's lodge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stone . He placed the turquoise amid the splintered glass , and returned to his shack satisfied , no doubt , that he had well expressed his view of a villain . I14Poor Eddy ! Anyone less villainous , but more full of human folly and bombast , I have never known . But from then the breach was final . Wesley never again sailed in the Sally Gaylord. 3It was all moving to an end as the winter came on , but this was still hidden from us . There was a day when , for those parts , the weather was harsh and cold . The woods were leafless and the lake was leaden . We walked with Whaley into Porteven . It was a favorite walk of ours : by the road to the village , back along the cliffs to Eddy Rodda 's lodge , and home through the woods by the lake . All Porteven was busy with the pilchards . They lay in salted mounds upon the quay : rectangular heaps shaped like the clamps of root crops that you see on a farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , when the huer had raised his cry , and we had watched the seine Ix , ats go out into the sea where the fish boiled and bubbled in their millions , making a turbulence like the wake of a great ship . The nets went down and drew them to the surface , and then there was such a bailing and dipping with buckets and baskets that , when the boats came ashore , their gunwales were wallowing almost at water level and they were solid with the scaly suffocated mass of the fish . These were shoveled out upon the quay and the women and children , working furiously among the screaming maddening gulls , piled them , layered with salt , into the masses we now saw . The piles had been thatched , but now that the pilchards were well pickled the thatch had been taken away and all hands were engaged in stowing the fish into baskets . There were stones like the ones that curlers use when they play upon the ice , and these , suspended by ropes to levers , pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the sea sneaked in here , and Whaley did riot allow us to linger long , but we were there long enough to observe Eddy Rodda working at one end of the clamp and Wesley at the other . You may be sure it was not chance that had separated them . They did not so much as look at one another . The men and women were singing as they worked , and as usual it was a hymn . Eddy and Wesley were singing with the rest , Wesley with a grave concentration , Eddy with bravado and self-display . We watched for a while , and were then about to move off when one of the men cried to Sally : " Well , my little maid , be ' e sober today ? " Some of the people laughed , some looked ashamed , and among them all there was a sudden hold of the breath . Something had been put into words that had not been named before , at any rate not to115us and not , I en sure , to Eddy Rockla . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IA ho reacted as sharply as though the man had struck him . Ile walked to the middle of the line , stuck out his chin aggressively toward this roan , and said : " You do n't belong to talk like that to the maiden . " I do n't think the fellow had meant any harm . It had been a carelesslyspoken word , and he seemed surprised to find it taken so much amiss . Especially it must have been surprising to sec the gentle Wesley thrusting out his jaw like a prizefighter  --  surprising and irresistible , for the man drew back a few feet and gave Wesley a blow that landed him flat upon the salty mound of fish . It was not much of a blow : Wesley was not hurt : he got up and began to walk back to his place at the end of the clamp . But the effect upon Captain 11odda was astounding . He stood for a moment as though he could not believe what he had seen ; then he launched his great weight forward and fell upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth like a hammer , and a spatter of blood stained the gray-white pile of pilchards . Eddy did not give a chance of recovery . His attack was so swift and surprising that no one intervened . He smacked blow after blow into the man 's face till I felt sick to see the bloody mess it was in . Miss Whale was audibly groaning . She took my hand and Sally 's and began to tug us away . I was nauseatedby the bloodshed and ready enough to go , but Sally broke loose and ran into the melee . While everyone else stood paralyzed by this orgy of violence iii which ( it seems to me now ) Eddy was releasing his own self-loathing , she took him by the sleeve and shouted in a sharp imperious voice : " I , odda ! Stop this ! Stop it at once ! " And he clid . The sound of her voice recalled him from whatever privy madhouse he was loose in . His hands dropped to his sides , the knuckles red . l le looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man he had battered walked Eddy went back to his place at the end of the clamp and looked down the line of workers to his son . " You all right , Wesley ? " he asked . Wesley did not answer . The work began again , but now there was no singing . As we moved off with Whaley through that gray lowering afternoon , we could feel the tension behind us pressing on our hacks . I , at least , was glad to go , to reach the cliff path where the wind met us , wholesome off the miles of toppling water. 4Sally left us and went down a zigzag track that led from the cliff to the beach . We could see her down there , keeping pace with our own progress , but close to the sea . The wind was southerly , so thatI16it was behind the rising tide , and the rollers came in piling up into bottle-green concavities , crested with tossing gray . They towered and curled and fell with a smashing reverberation . But before they fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves and blew them inshore in mist and spindrift . Sally was enveloped in this gray curtain . She ran through it blithely as the little sandpipers run , scrounging their food on the edge of a rising sea . We were approaching Rodda 's lodge , and the thunder of the water on the bar beyond it reached us . It was like the booming of guns . We ran down the path near the lodge , with the wind snatching at our clothes , and Sally joined us there as we stood with the incessant blow making us breathless , looking out upon the majestic confusion . Our clothes pressed upon us in front , streamed out behind , so that we leaned upon the weather like figureheads . " It 's worsening , " Sally shouted above the uproar , and if it could get worse than this then , I thought , it would be bad indeed . In the foreground were these perpetuallysmashing rollers that made tie earth tre , nble beneath our feet and that ran back with a hiss and rattle of pebbles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next wave . Farther out , the sea was a somber heaving tumult and the spume upon it seemed to unite it in one menace with the torn and streaming gray rags of the sky . The evening was coming quickly on . A wild distraughtpallor in the west was all that spoke of sunset , and here and there a gull plunged and swerved , making the wind almost visible . Sally 's face was aglow . " When this starts , " she shouted , " it usually goes on for days . Is n't it gorgeous ? " To the east , where the land sloped up gradually out of the bar , the darkness was taking hold . Indeed , you could not now see that land 's beginning : you could see only grayness merging into blackness , and out of this , as if putting aside a curtain and so coming into sight , appeared my father riding upon his horse Peter , who had carried him at Balaclava . One would have said the weather had seized upon his spirit , as it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand was a wonderful place for such exercise , and he came down upon us in a pounding gallop , that made my romantic heart beat wildly as I thought that thus , with hundreds of others , he and this horse had charged through a Russian valley to its narrowing throat stopped with guns . And the sound of these waves might be the sound of guns , this tattered sky the smoking wrack of battle . He gave a great shout as he went past us with a creak of leather , a panting of the horse 's breath , a streaming of its tail . Then he came more slowly back , passed us without a word , and turned Peter 's head toward the water . Sally now was almost literally dancing with excitement . " Watch this ! " she shouted . " It 's wonderful ! " I17 " I 1 ( " s never going into the sea ! " Whaley cried . " Oh , yes ! " Sally said . " 1 le often does . I le likes to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse was going in a slow canter toward the water , moving straight into the wind , tossing his head up and clown , and the wind was tossing the mane , and the tail was a Wonderful streamed conclusion of the line of neck and back that flowed as if the wind had drawn it . his cars were pricked forward , and tie wind brought back to us the snorting of his flared nostrils . In that wide solitude there was somethingprofound and elemental in the moment as the man leaned on the neck of the gray horse , soothing and whispering to him , and the horse slowly approached the gray sea . For now all was gray . The green had been dredged out of the hollows of the waves . They were black , and only their torn cockscombs had a livid whiteness that flung itself despairingly above the thunder on the bar . Whaley and I caught our breath when at last Peter 's proud feet went into the water . In a moment he was among the breakers and I did not see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though all the Atlantic were boiling in rage at the affront , pushing the waves forward in endless echelons to sweep this puny invader back whence he had come . My heart contracted with fear , for the gray horse and the gray sea were hard to disentangle and the immense undulation held valleys in which horse and rider from time to time disappeared . A man went past us , and I saw that it was Captain Rodda . He ran down to the water 's edge and stood there amid the wreckage of shattered waves , peering seaward . There was nothing he could do , but it comforted me to see him there . I felt sure  --  and feel sure now  --  that had that struggling unity of man and horse toppled and overturnedhe would have thrown himself into the waves and tried to beat a way to them , hopeless and forlorn though the effort might be . But there was no call for that . Incredibly and unconquerably , they were returning ; as they were lifted up to a wave 's summit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rump . The three of us ran then and joined Captain Rodda among the spindrift 's drenching , reckoning nothing of this in the relief that warmed us . Man and horse were heavily panting . Captain Rodda shouted : " You 're mad , Burnage ! " and Father answered with a laugh : " It 's a moment for brandy , Rodda . I must be off home . " He leaned down and picked up Sally , swung her onto the saddle in front of him and cantered off . Rodda went , too , without a word to us ; and , following after , clutching Maggie 's hand , I felt as desolate as on that day when I was left behind in Hyde Park and he had disappeared into the May morning driving the four-in-hand . " Of course heII8would pick up Sally . Why should he pick up you ? " I asked myself reasonably as we walked through the dark woods . But I wished all the same that he had picked up me. 5Sally was right . The weather worsened . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and water . The boats remained locked in Porteven harbor . Life there was half suspended , as though a devil were raging and nothing could be done until it pleased him to depart . Even in Tresant , with the shoulder of the cliff and the woods between us and the sea , the wind that rushed shoreward was frightening , to me at any rate , screaming and sobbing high above the roofs as if mortified at being unable to reach us . Trees crashed in the woods , and as I lay awake listening to the insensate commotion it would sometimes be threaded by the crying of the curlews . This has always seemed to me the most disembodied cry in nature , the cry of loneliness itself , beautiful , forlorn , and inlrwuan ; and , child though I was , it stirred in me vague but disturbing visions of a world in which men were done with , and the seas raged upon uninhabited and desolate shores , shores without footprints , the dead moon gleaming and the curlews crying . I hardly slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however far inland I may be , the cry of the wind is the one thing that will keep me awake at night , my imagination breasting through it , as Peter breasted through the waves , back to its source above the hills and hollows of a troubled sea . Because out on the sea are the boats , and men in them : the men who have been caught too far from a landfall and lie under the stress with their salty eyelids straining for the first wan blink of day . If you have lived by the sea , if you have ever had men on the sea , you can not be cozy when the winds and tides unite in rage . My mother knew the effect the weather was having upon me , and one night , to my joy , she came into my room , with a dressing gown tied about her , and carrying a lamp . She shut the door quietly , put the lamp on a table , and sat upon the edge of my bed . Oh , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time when she would come in dressed for some grand occasion and say good night to me . She placed a hand upon my forehead and said : " You feel hot , darling . Ca n't you sleep ? " " No , " I said , seizing her hand and holding it close ; " I ca n't sleep with this going on , but when it 's over I shall sleep like a log , night after night . " **26;5978;TOOLONG tall , rugged , and strong-looking , here had come a man in whom she thought she could place her trust . She had felt his maleness dominating her , and his strength gave her courage to meet her father 's approaching death . Elias had seen the warm glow which she knew suffused her features as she waited on the young man from Smaland as he ate , and noticed that she cooked Peter 's favorite foods , and looked with favor on her growing tenderness . Was it that he , too , had admired the stranger who had come to help , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to take the place of that which he once had given to this place , that strength which now had disintegratedinto such awful weakness ? Or was it that he had wanted to assure himself of her marriage , that he might not fail in his promise to his wife that he would not leave this world until he was sure of the family 's being perpetuated , perhaps thinking of the words , " Norden  --  never to be sold . " Her lips curled , she who had now two children to show for two years of marriage , as she thought of her girlhood fears that she might never have a child . What then would have become of Norden ? Yes , Elias had welcomed Peter 's wish to become his son-in-law , and that had been good to know as her head had lain on Peter 's breast and she sobbed her grief at her father 's passing . It had been good to feel Peter 's arms around her , and feel the beating of his heart , strong , slow , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pastor had laid her father to rest , she had stilled Peter 's quiet but insistent urging and taken him to husband . Her dowry was the farm , patches of fields for crops and acres of stony land , on this island off the coast of Sweden . There was the peat and a good quarry of stone , the fishing boats , the little lake which furnished ice for all summer  --  a lake fed by the spring , life-giving , life-saving wonderful spring of fresh water  --  and not by any means least , the homestead with its barns and cattle . Yes , her dowry had been good . Peter had brought himself and his Bible and his pipe . He had been so sure , had Elias , that Morfar would approve her choice ; how disappointing to read her grandfather 's letter20begging her to wait . For the first time came doubt of her grandfather'swisdom ; after all , he knew Peter but little  --  had only brushed beside him on the docks  --  and what he knew of him was second-hand , learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who , before the letter came , had become her husband . Morfar would learn that she had made no mistake , she would see to that . " Beware so silent a man ; the river runs deepest that runs smoothest , " his letter had read . But he was not as wise as she in this ; why , in Peter 's very silence there was strength ! Or so she had thought then . And now he stood before her , bested by the intricacy of the preparation of a boiled egg . No , he was not much of a helper . Come to think on it now , she could not remember what , if any , help he had given her with the plantingthat summer he had come to help ; he had spent his time followingher about , trying to touch her at every opportunity , trying to corner her in the barn or in the fields so that he might run his hand down her arm or around her waist . But almost from the day he was her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rarely did he turn a hand to help with the outsidework or heavy work in the barn or house . Sigrid felt ashamed for the many times of late she had wondered if she had not made a poor match . But it was different now . Now he was the father of her son . She looked up at him and saw the red flush of anger spread over his face as his fingers tightened on the pot handle and he opened his mouth to speak . Poor Peter , hungry , needing her to wait on him , needing her as much as Lissie did , or little Karl . No , he should not have to do woman 's work . He was her man ; she would wait on him , and serving him with loving kindness bring back the interest he had shown before she was his wife . She eased her arm from under the baby 's head , pulled a coverletfrom the foot end of the bed and wrapped it around her . Slowly and carefully she stretched her feet to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in front of her to steady herselfand , pushing it forward , she walked uncertain steps toward Peter . With a smile , she gently took the copper pot from his hand and stood it on the trivet . The water in the kettle was hot . She poured some into the pot , enough to cover guinea-hen eggs ; she21reached for the teapot , carefully measured six pinches of tea , poured hot water over that and set the pot aside to steep . She cut pieces of dark bread from the loaf and laid them neatly on a fringed blue linen cloth covering her silver bread dish . " Dear little Lissie , you and your papa will have a breakfast party all by yourselves while mama rests for just a little time . You must be a big girl now that you are a big sister , and help papa get the butter and the milk . " Sigrid patted the blond curls as Elisabet nodded her head . She poured herself a cup of tea and sat on her bed to drink it . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her toes it warmed her and made her not only comfortable , but sleepy . She could have felt very hungry , she thought . But she was too dizzy to stay on her feet longer so she crawled under the covers , drew the little boy baby close to her , uncovered her breast and with the two first fingers of her left hand guided the nipple to his mouth . As he made no move , she drew the nipple forth and back slowly along the length of his tiny mouth , then up and down over the upper and lower lips . He opened them then , grabbed , and with a firm , steady pressure , sucked. 22IIISHE DID NOT KNOW which of the three things woke her , whether it was the bright light from the reflection of the winter sun on the white snow outside , or the wetness of the bed at her side , or whether it was a movement on the bed , making the straw mattress under the featherbed sound like a little tired cricket . What could that movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely breathing , afraid she might disturb the picture . She wanted to look , and keep on looking so it would be imprinted indelibly on her mind , to look back upon always . Next to her lay the baby Karl . Beyond , toward the wall , was Elisabet half-kneeling , half-sprawled on her stomach , resting on her elbows , reaching over the little baby . With his little clenched fists caught in her hands , gleefully she was having him " pat-acake , " saying in her lisping baby talk : " Bake , bakes kaka , Lagga smor emellan , Mjola denMjola denMjola den , Sd hyss i ungnenOch pladask i askan. " 23The hands went high over his head as he " hoisted it into the oven " and down , way down , as he " dropped it into the ashes . " Seeing that her mother had awakened , she looked up and smiled a broad " See how smart he is  --  ? " Sigrid reached over and lifted Elisabet to her and hugged her close and kissed her many times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you because you are so sweet , and I love you for loving your little brother . " Elisabet snuggled close to her mother , seeming to sense that she was not being replaced by the new baby in her mother 's affections , and giving the impression with her innocent sense of securitythat her mother was capable of a love large enough to encompass all , the whole world if need be . Sigrid laid one baby on either arm , and in her happiness wondered if there was any other woman in the world as fortunate as she . How she wished she could find time to write her thoughts ! She would write about her homeland and about the sea that encircled it . She knew she could write a story about the sea . Here was a " personality " whose moods and strength and generosity should and could be written so that everyone all over the world could know its beauty , its wildness , its joy at being chosen to reflect the colors of the sunset , its anger at being restricted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inland folk who did not know the sea . She wished Peter would bend a little in his rigid rule that no book other than the Bible should be opened in these rooms while he was master of the house . How was she to insure her son 's being able to learn  --  as she had learned all through her childhood , and until Peter 's coming  --  from Morfar and his reading from the store of books which he called his ? More had she learned , of the history of Sweden and the world and of places and of peoples , here in this room beside the fireplace than ever could be taught at the elementarskolan on the mainland . And many , many times as much as ever she would have learned at the island school . For Morfar had colored the mental pictures which arose from the printed pages of his books with crayons of travel and experience , erudition and understanding , and the inborn talent of the24teacher . She thought back now and realized , how in everything she did with Morfar , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers except for him . How was she to overcome Peter 's tyranny when Karl was old enough so Morfar and she could read to him ? She could think of no way now . But think of one she would in the days to come . The little time she spent each morning , before her husband awakened , reading the books her grandfather would bring to her and the few notations she could make , were not enough . But as she had marked Elisabet before her birth with the defacing scar , she hoped her will to mark Karl with a love of good reading , and writing , would take as deep and lasting an effect . She liked to conjectureabout what would be the driving force in Karl 's life . If she had been able to endow him with the love of the written word and God had given him the creative ability , about what would he write ? Would it be the love of a woman , ambition , envy , greed , or would he too have this awe of the majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have everything in the way of education and enlightenment . She would prepare the way for him to have a higher school education than the one the small school on the mainland had given her . And was not one of the provisions of the old-time land grant that the sons of the house of Wingren should be entitled to tuition at the great University ? Sigrid thought now of the spring which soon would be coming to Norden . Spring would bring back her beloved grandfather , her Morfar . Then the little stolen moments in the early morning would have added enjoyment . He would ask her for her comments on the last book he had brought her and would argue points with her . He would tell her about his southern sojourn and encourage her to do the thing she wanted so to do . He would tell her of the opera and of the symphony ; and she would watch his face grow pensive as he 'd tell of hearing again a melody which made him yearn not to be as he was  --  alone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd recall how , as she grew , she came to know the symphony through his telling , until now when they talked of music , opera , costumes , stage , they spoke as fellow theatre-goers. 25She loved the music of the violin . Elias , her father , had played the violin in his youth , played for the island dances and at weddings , but he had given the instrument to Morfar to lay away after her mother died . He had no heart to play , Morfar said , but Sigrid wished he had taught her more than just to draw the bow across the strings and hold her fingers so , to make it sing one certain tone . Willing to learn , these fingers . She looked at them . Too practical , perhaps , for the making of beautiful music . But thanks to Morfar 's and her father 's teaching , they could carve . What would her grandfather say when he should come and see that little fiddler , there on the sill , that she had carved ? Soon spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring would come flowers . Not a large variety grew around the house in her little flower garden , but those that had a home there showed the effects of the love she gave them , roses and her beautiful columbine , and pansies . Pansies ! Here was an idea ! She would use pansies as the pattern for the next hooked rug she made . Oval it would be , a long narrow oval with a black center and a border of pansies , one of each of the brilliant velvety colors . " I will make it for Elisabet , for her dower chest . " Her eyes followed the sunlight upward to the small-paned casement windows with their deep sills . On one of the four sills were three begonia plants and on another sill was her fuchsia , deep purple over-petals with drop-petals of rosy pink . The plants on the sills were between the curtains and the recessedglass of the sash , and although the curtains were drawn well to one side , the plants vied with them as to which should have a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair which had been of such friendly service at breakfast time . Sigrid always had liked that stool . She guessed it had been in the home almost forever . But  --  how was it set neatly in its accustomed place ? She had left it standing beside her bed . And , for that matter , how had Elisabet gotten up on the bed ? Where was Peter ? 26And the barn ! Oh , how would she ever be able to forgive herself for dreaming away her time so .. . . The door to the summer kitchen , or general utility room , opened and Peter walked into the room . In one hand he carried the little wooden egg bucket half full of hens ' eggs . In the other hand was her shovel . Peter had finished the tunnel . He had cared for the animals . " Oh , Peter , dear Peter , thank  --  " " Well , you did n't expect me to eat guinea eggs until the thaw , did you ? " Sigrid wondered why he should seem shamefaced , embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fireplace and put the eggs on the table . Was it that he was ashamed at the recollection of his neglect of her ? Or was he ashamed of his submission to necessity ? She would never know . " It was good of you , Peter . " He pulled his kubbstol closer to the fire , sat down in it , slowly and painstakingly filled his pipe , pressed down the tobacco into the bowl , lighted it , and drew deeply on the stem until he saw firelight through the flakes of tobacco . Releasing a little puff of smoke , he reached for his Bible , turned to the record of family births and on the line below the entry , " Elisabet Selma Petersdotter , " he wrote in a laboring hand , " Karl Mattias Petersson , Fodd den 9 Februari  --  " 27IVFon TWO WEEKS now Sigrid had used tho olive oil to bathe the little one born in midwinter . She looked at her hands . They had softened and were smooth . How true , that in doing for others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her devotion to the task of keeping the infant 's skin clean but unchapped , the oil had healed the open rough chap of her own hands . They no longer bled at the corners of the nails nor in the cracks which had come at the joints and knuckles . Sigrid had left her bed early with no fear of disturbing her husband , as she and Karl had continued to occupy the bench . It was too crowded in the bunk bed for all four , and the winter nights were very cold , much too cold for Elisabet to sleep alone . Of course it was too cold for Karl to sleep in the cradle . She smiled as she thought with what facility she could get accustomed to pampering herself . It was too cold in the cradle , but how convenientit was , too , just to turn over in the night when he cried , undo the front of her night-shift and nurse him until he fell asleep again . She wondered if she were getting slack , or if perhaps her desire28to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fullest this new happiness . She wanted to enjoy him , so her delight in having him would be reflected in everything around him , so he would be able to feel the force of her joy and her love to be his lodestar through his lifetime . It was happiness , the greatest she had ever known , to lie relaxed , with his head in the crook of her arm and his little mouth pressed to her breast . Oh , how she wanted happiness for him ! Some discontent , yes , but only the discontent which would lead him to knowledge and accomplishment , but never discontent or unhappiness in his home . Soon her grandfather would come . She noted in her daily record , " That will be a happy day , when he comes home . I think I shall have some fun with him . I will tie a big red bow of yarn on the little wisp of hair on top of little Karl 's head . And at first glance , he will think there is another girl . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then I will tell him he has a namesake . " He will be pleased with Lissie , too . She is a very good girl and wants to help me with everything I do . Will he have good word for me from the great doctors at the spa ? Will he say they gave him any hope at all that the birthmark may be removed by opera-tion ? " Sigrid fondled and stroked the little diary with her right hand , and with the left she turned the pages and found her place in her book of current reading : The House of the Rue Plumet . As she read , she wondered what kind of a woman the mother of Victor Hugo had been , to be able to produce such a son ! Was it she who had given him this gift of placing words with which everyone was familiar , into groups , making phrases to lift one 's soul to undreamedheights and pluck the very innermost thoughts and dreams out of one 's own heart and place them on paper ? The hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leave the daily reading of the Bible to Peter . She remembered how , when Peter first had suggested that they read it together , aloud , she had wanted to talk over certain passages which were not clear to her , or to compare their individual interpretationsof other passages as she had done when Morfar had29read to her from the Good Book , and her father , too . But he had become enraged , almost violent . This was God 's word . He , Peter , would not permit discussion of God 's word under his roof ! Somehow , Sigrid thought , she seemed nearer to God when she watched a little shoot poke its head from the warm , moist earth in the spring , or when she helped at the birth of a baby to a woman on a neighboring farm or island , or when the sun set or the sea called , than when she heard over and over again the droning , stilted reading of the Book on Peter 's lap . Yes , except on the Sabbath Day , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe his constant reading would help to serve to gain her entrance into Heaven , too . Soon the dawn would come . The stolen moments were too few . Tenderly she inserted the little diary far back into the crevice and laid the volume of Victor Hugo on top and without making a sound , replaced the bricks to conceal the hiding place . " My Niche for Literature , " Sigrid called it . It was good that Peter was not , like some husbands , always searching for places to repair in order to keep the house in good order ! Victor Hugo  --  little KarlBefore closing the book the last two sentences had imprinted themselves on her memory , and she repeated them again , " Certain thoughts are prayers . There are moments when the soul is kneeling , no matter what the attitude of the body may be . " Now , before the morning chores , she would finish the christeningmitts for Karl , to match the shirt she had sewn in those first three wonderful days after his birth . Three whole days she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do . She had wondered at her own dereliction of duty , being satisfied to allow Peter to go to the barn and give the animals and fowls their daily care . He had said it was a waste of time to sew another christening dress . Why could n't she use the one she had for Elisabet ? It was an heirloom , worn by all the Sigrids and passed down the line to each in turn . And so Elisabet had worn it too . Made of homespun linen , with petticoats and pinning blanket to match , 30Time had thinned it almost to " fairy " weight . Beautiful , simple , but delightfully feminine . For Karl , Sigrid wanted a boy 's christening outfit . So she had made a set of petticoats of her finest linen cloth , plain-hemmed . And for the outer skirt , had gathered on to a tiny sleeveless yoke , the full skirt . Then a shirt , plain , and to extend shortly below the hipline , with vertical tucks at the shoulders , full sleeves tucked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the neck and wrists were ruffles about the width of her little finger . And now the mitts . They were of linen material too . She cut them out of the cloth , a little pointed section for the four fingers , and a thumb . The mittens were finished . But she had spent more time than she should have . Sigrid blew out the flame in the lamp , and as she turned to feel the soil in the flower pot , she saw the pattern of the frost on the paneQuickly she turned to the fireplace . Peter was awakening . There was not time to get her lead pencil out of the fireplace niche so she picked up a piece of charcoal from the grate , and on a scrap of the white linen , sketched the pattern from the windowpane . This was the perfect pattern for a shawl , a perfect shawl for Karl . She would knit him one , of the finest wool she could card , in a blue of the sea when it was peaceful , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth , and honor . Yes , she would use this pattern , sent to her by the Frost King . She would give her best workmanship , her finest art of stitchery and imagination in working this pattern into a shawl . " ' What foolishness is this ? " Her husband leaned over her shoulder and ran his hand down the front of her bosom . " I have just planned a most beautiful pattern for a shawl  --  for Karl . " " You are quite well again , Sigrid . " His eyes narrowed , his lips parted , and his tongue slid over his upper lip , then his lower lip  --  again and again , until the saliva drooled onto his chin31 " You have no further need to sleep on the bench . " His experienced hand went further , grasped her full breast and tightened on it until she almost cried aloud with pain . Peter drew back and looked at her appraisingly , and with finality , " Tonight you will sleep with me . And I want plattar for breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but tonight is too soon . You know that . Be patient . " The delicate Swedish pancakes , plattar , were especially good . Sigrid topped hers and Elisabet 's with lingonberry sauce , but Peter preferred his own way of stacking five plattar in a pile and , on the pancakes , a three-minute boiled egg so that when he broke the egg , the yolk flowed over the cakes like syrup . After eating five piles of pancakes , five eggs , and four cups of tea , he tipped his chair back and smacked his lips . " Is n't it about time your Morfar filled up our coffee bin ? Swedes should not have to drink tea . Let the weak Britons be satisfied with tea . A morning meal without coffee is not to start the day good for a man . " " I know Morfar Karl will bring coffee when he comes . I think we must have been wasteful with the last he brought us . You are right , Peter , a good cup of coffee with the plattar would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and Peter took his chair , drew it close to the fire , lighted his pipe and entered into his customary silence , broken only by the turning of a page of the Bible . After clearing away the table setting , and washing the dishes , Sigrid bathed the baby and fed him , placed him snugly on the warm bed and then washed his diapers while there was still warm water left in the large iron kettle on the grate . She did not relish the sight of the clothes hung on the drying poles around the top of the fireplace , but there was no other place to hang them in the winter . Over the long poles she looped the baby clothes to dry , then dressed Elisabet warmly and together they went to the barn . My ! How the colt grew ! Each day he was taller and friskier than the day before . He stood still while she stroked his nose and spoke into his ear of his new master , and his eyes shone under-32standingly as though he waited as eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his back . Over , on to the top of the compost box went the droppings of the night , and when each of the feeding bins was filled and the floors swept clean , Sigrid wiped the bags of the cows with a clean linen cloth ; and reaching into the front of her dress , brought out a pair of homemade white linen gloves . Drawing them on , she started to milk . Elisabet followed her mother throughout the day , and as one chore after the other was accomplished , peals of laughter rang through the house or barn . Everything was a game . There was fun in everything to be done , it seemed . As Elisabet had grown big enough to begin to toddle around , she had always gone to her father , touched his hand , and said , " Papa laugh ? " But his expression rarely changed , and with the passing of the days her attempts to include him in their fun becamefewer , until now she seemed almost afraid of his surly bearing . For Sigrid this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of laughter , full of the joy of living , and full of dreams for the future of her children . It was late . Peter sat asleep in his kubbstol , his pipe cold in his hand , his head relaxed and hanging backward with the mouth open emitting heavy snores . Quietly she undressed before the fire , went to Elisabet on the bed , kissed her and knelt to ask God 's grace , then turned to her bench . Keeping her eyes open and fixed on little Karl , she clasped her hands and knelt again and prayed , a fervent prayer of Thanksgivingfor the many blessings which were hers . As she slipped into bed , she added , " And thank you too , dear God , for the wonderful privilege of being able to lie down after the day , in a clean bed , to stretch my body its full length  --  and rest  --  and go to sleep  --  " 33VSIGRID KNEW sHE would have another baby . Instinctively she knew , even at first . And now April came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godt Som f drags . " The little rhyme , which had told her countrymen for generationsthat April snow was as good as sheep manure for the crops , rang through her brain . It was true . Snow in April and fertility were synonymous . The crops always had shown the truth of it , and who was she to deny that the woman who saw snow fall in this spring month would bear a child that year ? Had it not snowed in April the year Elisabet was born  --  and Karl ? " Let the morrowTake care of the morrow , Leave things of theFuture to Fate , " 34she sang . This day was the important day . This was to be Karl 's christening day . The huge drifts of snow had been melting and for almost a week there had been sunshine , almost a full week , ever since last Monday . Peter had been even more moody and morose than usual because the inclement weather and heavy snow had preventedtheir going to the mainland to church for the christening service on the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame Sigrid because the snow had not melted . During the last two weeks of the month of February , his irritation at the weather and her , grew with the passing of each day , and when March came and went and they were unable still to make their way from the house , his sarcasm and upbraidings became almost intolerable . But now , today , Palm Sunday , Peter had declared that even though the snow fell ten feet deep , the christening was to be postponedno longer . Sigrid 's eyes danced and her face was alive with happiness . She would try to make it a perfect day . Secretly , although she was sorry Peter was distressed , she had been glad the weather and deep snow had prevented their leaving the island , had wished she could put off the day until her grandfathercame home so he could witness the christening of his greatgrandchild , his namesake . But , she planned , she would write every little detail of the events of this day , and have a full description of it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it would seem as though he had been with them . What a wonderful day for her , to stand at the baptismal font and hear the Pastor give her son that dearly beloved name , Karl . As though he read her thoughts , Peter said , " All you think about is the naming of the child . Do you not realize the main thing is that the boy will be entering the service of God ?  --  entering His Church ? " " Oh , yes , Peter , I do . I do know and feel the spiritual significance of the ritual . But I just ca n't be all spiritual . I guess I am too much the mortal , too human not to enjoy seeing our baby dressed in all his finery , being the center of all eyes in the church and35getting especial attention from the Reverend Oskarsstrom , and having biro given that beautiful name  --  the name I love so very much  --  Karl . " You are so good . You are so much better than I am , Peter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us , between us , give our children a full , good training . You guide their spiritual life , and I will guide their physical well-being . If we knit these together with love , Peter , we can  --  " and she moved toward him with her arms open , hoping and yearning for even the merest sign of tenderness and understanding . But Peter turned away . " Come , Lissie , I will dress you first , and then you can watch while mama gets little brother Karl ready . " Elisabet ran to her mother , and Sigrid reached for a bundle neatly wrapped in a white linen towel . Unfolding the towel , she smiled broadly and said , " And here is your new dress for Karl 's christening day , " and as the child 's eyes widened , " You did not think for one minute that mama did not make you a new dress , too ! " Sigrid hugged the little girl , then started to undress her . " Here , now let me draw on these new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knit pants completed the ensemble . The dress of the same light blue had a tight plain bodice to the waistline , full puffed sleeves to the elbow and straight and tight to the wrist , a tiny ruff-like ruffle at the neckline , and a full , very full skirt . At the waistline were little flowers , fivepetalled , crocheted of a pale shell-pink wool with tiny yellow French-knot centers . Mittens and a bonnet matched , a plain blue knit bonnet with the pink flowers bordering the edge near the face . Sigrid lifted the beaming child and stood her on a chair . Oh , it was wonderful to see the little girl so proud and happy . What recompense for the hours spent in making the little garments ! Her heart was full of happiness . " Lissie , you are beautiful ! " She sat her down on the bed . With a thoroughly unconscious movement , the little girl 's hand raised and brushed against the ugly birthmark . Sigrid 's eyes grew moist as she turned to dress the baby boy. 36Both children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She called to Peter to bring the horse and carriage to the door . With his gloved hand , Peter held the horse 's bit while Sigrid with her right hand and arm lifted Elisabet to the back seat of the open " spring wagon " carriage . Clutching Karl tightly with her left arm , she hoisted herself up alongside the little girl . Peter threw the tapestry bag , in which she had carefully placed clean diapers and other necessities , into the carriage at her feet . Dry- washing his hands by a quick motion of one palm against the other , he stepped to the driver 's seat and clucked to the horse to be on its way . Sigrid knew she could have walked the short distance to the boat landing almost in the time it took to get into the wagon . But since Peter had come to Norden , one did not walk on Sun- day . The boat was sturdy and , with both her and Peter manning the oars , they soon reached the mainland . Karl slept , but Elisabet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adventure ! Peter made the little boat fast , leaped out , and climbed up the steep incline from the landing to the lane leading to the church with quick , long strides . Sigrid held little Karl close in her left arm , the tapestry bag over the wrist , while with her other hand she clasped Elisabet 's hand tightly . " Now , Lissie , we will have a music lesson . I will sing with the motion of the bobbing of the boat . When the boat goes down , I will sing away down low ; and when it goes up with the swell , I will sing high  --  real high " We will have to jump when I sing real high , so when I sing high like this , and press your hand real tight , you spring with me and we will land there on the dock , together . See  --  ? " She chanted until the child swayed with her to the perfect rhythm of the rocking of the boat . " Now  --  jump ! " They landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them frightened , but laughing . As the boat receded with the water , Sigrid laughed , 37 " It is good we cleared the space , because we really did n't need baths . And Karl is the one who is to be baptized ! " The little girl looked up at her mother understandingly , with love and trust in her deep blue eyes , and , clinging tightly to the guiding hand , moved closer . The curving lane soon brought them within sight of the church . Sigrid stopped , entirely to enjoy the thrill she experienced always when she saw a church with its steeple cutting the vastness of the sky . Here it was , the Lutheran Church , its tall spire not only providingthe symbol of reaching for heavenly spheres , but in its square louvred base giving a home to countless numbers of chirpingbirds . The church was of red brick , not large , but copied in its general lines from one of the beautiful churches in Stockholm . She loved each line of it , those of the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper  --  extending wider on either side  --  covered by a plain hip roof . There , at the rear the roof formed three narrow triangles to accommodate itself to the brick bay which , on the inside , formed the background for the altar . And the windows  --  three large and beautifully wrought stainedglasswindows  --  breaking the lines of the long brick side " Look , Lissie , this is our church , your church . Let us bow our heads and give thanks that we may come here to this beautiful place . " " My dear , let me help you with one of the children . " Sigrid looked up , surprised by the sweet voice , and saw two nuns in the sombre garb of their Catholic Order . The taller Sister lifted Karl from her arm , as the owner of the voice knelt and spoke softly to Elisabet . " Oh , thank you ! " " It is our pleasure to see a young mother bringing her children to a place of worship of Our Lord . " Sigrid noticed especially that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for a fleeting second , on the birthmark . And she thought , " Here is a kindness , here in folk whom our people ridicule . " " Dear lady , " the tall nun asked , " may I ask where you obtained38the beautiful sheer woolen of which your skirt is made ? It is of the finest woolen cloth I have ever seen . " " I spun the yarn and wove the cloth . It is  --  ' " You made the cloth ? " " Oh , yes . I make all of our cloths and clothes . I think this is not fine , only the finest I can make . " The one whom her companion called Sister Angela , reached down and rubbed the cloth between her fingers and thumb . " If you did not already , very apparently , have your capable hands full , we would beg you to come with us . Our Mother would welcome you with wide open arms to supervise our spinning and weaving rooms . You could teach us much . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical voice , " come and visit us , please . " They had reached the church door , and the gathered congregationseemed to fall aside to leave an open way for Sigrid and her companions , to assure themselves of not being contaminated by any chance touch by the followers of a despised creed . At the door Sigrid reached for the baby , but Sister Angela said , " We will help you to get comfortably seated . " Peter had said Roman Catholics would never enter a Protestant church . Sigrid was surprised but grateful for the kindly assistance . She felt refreshed and happy as she led the way to the pew in the rear of the church . " I will sit here , " she whispered , " because I will be near the baptismal font . " The nuns entered the pew , and one laid the baby lengthwise on the seat to the right of Sigrid , while the other kissed Elisabet on the forehead , and both whispered , " Bless you , my dear . May God bless you , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in silver wall sconces . The patina of the benches and the panelling on the walls shone in the flickering light . Dark red carpeting down the center aisle seemed to Sigrid to reflect a warm welcome to each member as he entered the doorway . The stained-glass windows wrote a life-like story of events of the Bible on the hearts of the assembled congregation . Sigrid looked reverently at the window above her . Against a blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds , walked the39Christ , a golden halo encircling His head . At His feet gathered many , many sheep . With one hand He braced His tall shepherd 's staff , while in the crook of His left arm was a tiny lamb . Below , in white letters imprinted on a bright red background , she read , In Memory of my Beloved SigridKarl Ivarsson of Norden " He is here with me , almost as much with me as though he sat beside me on this bench . Oh , Morfar , this is a happy day . " Keeping a hand lightly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open space between the bench seat and the back of the bench in front , and embracing Elisabet with the other arm , she bowed her head in thankful prayer . The morning service began . She saw Peter enter the other end of the pew , saw him remove his gloves and put them in his hat and place the bat on the floor under the bench , and saw him lean forward , head on clasped hands , as he prayed too . She saw heads turn to glance at the fine-looking man  --  her husband  --  and she was proud . After the regular Palm Sunday service was through , as the people sang , " Oh , Lord , our little ones to Thee In faith and hope we give ; We know that through the mystery Their new-born souls shall live , " the Pastor walked to the rear of the church and the congregation , as one body , stood and turned to face the baptismal font , the symbol of entry into the Church of God . Sigrid carried Karl to face the Pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost  --  " Sigrid listened to the Pastor tell of how all men are born in sin , and that , " Except one be born of water and the Spirit he can not enter the Kingdom of God , " and how the Lord himself had said , " Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not ; for of such is the Kingdom of God . " 40The Reverend Oskarsstrom placed his hand upon the head of the baby and repeated the Lord 's Prayer , in company with the voices of the entire congregation . Then he read the Creed , also joined by the people . He lifted the baby from Sigrid 's arms , and holding the tiny head in the cup of his left hand , three times poured water on Karl 's head , saying , " I baptize thee Karl Mattias , in the Name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . Amen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the little face grew red , the features wrinkled as the tiny body squirmed , shivereda little shiver , and with the merest inkling of a sound smothered by swaddling clothes , Karl slept soundly again , relieved . Those who were close enough to notice cast knowing looks to each other , with almost imperceptible head shakings . Handing Karl to his mother the Reverend Oskarsstrom pronouncedthe benediction upon the child and admonished the parents to take solemnly to heart the obligation of the Church to rear this child in the fear of the Lord . As Sigrid listened to the Pastor 's exhortation of God 's word , a ray of sunlight found the face of Christ in the memorial window and shone through the features , to pour its own benediction upon the head of the mother and the features of the child . Truly , God and her grandfather loved her , Sigrid thought , as she heard the Pastor 's concluding words , " Depart in Peace . " Peter already had shaken the hand of the Pastor and left the church by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped Karl in his shawl . She stopped to speak to several friends in the sunshine outside the church door . Then , seeing Peter sitting with another man on the low stone fence bounding the churchyard , she walked slowly toward them . As she came within hearing , she heard the stranger say , " Skam pa dej , Peter ! You have not been even friendly since you married the heiress . Why do we never see you any more ? Is it you are so in love with her , you can not leave her side for a day  --  or a night ? " His raucous laughter was cut short as Peter answered , " No , no , my friend . You do not know . It is not all roses . That41is right . I do not see you , but it is because I am ashamed . It was a sad day I married her . She is no woman . She is a hexa  --  you see how she hexed the baby girl . Never a day but I have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Swinging his head from side to side , " Yes , yes  --  a sad day it was  --  a sad day . " Rising and slapping Peter on the back with a resounding crack , the stranger shrieked , " Come , Peter , come  --  get away from it all . Come to my room and we will drink to the old life , the good life we knew before this hexa sucked you in . " Cognac  --  that is the thing ! " Cognac  --  good old friend . " With their arms around each other 's shoulders , and with the eyes of all the church-goers upon their backs , up the lane they went , the stranger singing a ribald song . Sigrid walked toward the boat landing , heavy-hearted . But she must not spoil Elisabet 's adventure , not let anything mar the perfect day of her son 's christening . Smiling , she helped Elisabet into the boat , there to wait for Peter . She reached into the tapestry bag , and out came a little parcel which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out pieces of buttered hardtack and small cakes which she divided equally with her chubby hands , between her mother and herself , giving each one alternately . They ate and laughed , while the little boat rose and fell . And as it hit the side of the wharf , they made believe they were going to fall from their plank seats , and screamed with glee . Karl woke up . Sigrid changed him , nursed him , and then began to wonder again how soon Peter would come . The sky darkened with rain clouds . She debated within herself whether to wait for Peter or to shove off and bring her children to the sanctuary of their own home . The sky grew increasingly darker , and Peter did not come . Sigrid released the boat , laid Karl on the bottom and soothingly encouraged Elisabet too , to take a little rest . Grasping the oar handles , she set out toward the island . Drops of rain began to fall so she spread a tarpaulin over the children at her feet , forming a tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board in front of her and with the other end wrapped around the lower part of her own body. 42Even for her , the rowing was heavy as the water roughened with the increasing storminess . Drenched , pulling with every ounce of strength she could muster , she started to sing . She sang the old sea songs her Morfar had taught her and played she was the captain of a large ship lost in wild and uncharted waters , played that as master of the vessel and entrusted with precious human cargo , she was sighting the land , which was home . What did she hear above the noise of the storm and the noise of the waves against the boat ? A horse ! And here she was at her own landing dock . Quickly she moored the boat , picked up first one child and then the other and leapt to the land . In a minute she had untied the horse , scrambled with the children into the wagon , and flicked the reins over the animal 's back . She reached the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend first to them and then bring the horse to the barn . She poked the sleeping fire in the grate and congratulatedherself on her foresight in having a large kettle of water warming on the trivet . Swiftly and with deft movements she removedElisabet 's clothing and lowered the tired child into warm water , rubbed her , drew on her night clothes , and laid her on the bed under the covers . Then she took off Karl 's christening finery , wet and soiled . Yes , soiled . Brown stains on white christening garments , ever an ill omen . She put them in back of her so she should not see them , and bathed him , nursed him again , and laid him in his cradle near the fireplace . She looked about the room to make sure all was safe , threw a woolen coverlet over her shoulders and went outside to brave the heavy rain . The horse neighed his thankfulness when she loosened him , and trotted behind her to the barn . She unharnessed him , rubbed him down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose as she gave him two precious cubes of sugar for being " such a good horse . " The milking done , eggs gathered , the barn cleaned and orderly , all the stock prepared for the night , she went to the colt and stroked his mane and whispered caressing words into his ear and told him how well behaved his young master had been at the43christening service , and how if she had been the one to say what should be , he would have been there to sit in the pew with them ! Fondly she spanked him on the flank and he danced up and down , round and round , trying to show his appreciation and affection . Elisabet was awake when she came back to the cheerful room , so together they sat on the bed and drank warm milk . Soon the child 's eyes closed and the mother laid her comfortably on the bed and drew the covers over her , tucking them under her back to keep her snug . Sigrid realized , with a chill that shook her whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She undressed before the fire , and wondered where Peter was and how soon he would come . She had thought to write all of the happenings of this wonderfulday . Yes , she would write to Morfar . But she would not write all . She would not write of Peter and the stranger . Searchingly she asked herself , " Wherein have I failed ? I want to be a good wife . I want to be a good mother . " She gathered the children 's clothing , and hung up her own to dry . The rain beat hard against the windows as she sat before the fire writing to her grandfather of the beautiful christening service , the kindly nuns , the pride she had known as she heard the Pastor give Karl his name , of the sunlight streaming through the stainedglasswindow -- - "  --  and Morfar , it has been an almost perfect day . It needed only you . Come home to us , soon . Good night . " She folded the sheet and placed it in her book and slid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound which might mean her husband was approaching , she picked up Karl from his cradle and laid him beside Elisabet under the covers of the bed , and kissed them both . Kneeling , she let her weary head fall upon her hands , as fervently she prayed , " Oh , Heavenly Father , help me to fit the pattern of my life to the cloth which is provided me. " 44VIMONDAY MORNING CAME , Monday afternoon , Monday night . And Tuesday . And Wednesday . And Peter did not come home . Sigrid watched Elisabet many times in her toddling waddle , go to Peter 's chair , point to the empty seat , and ask , " Papa  --  ? " How would he greet her when finally he came ? How should she greet him ? Would he be apologetic at having brought shame upon her before the people at the church ? Was he drinking all of the time he was away ? Would the stranger provide a woman as well as the cognac ? " Anyone would think I was jealous ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking out loud . I guess I meant to say , How would you like to help me scrub and polish all the copper pots this bright Thursday morning ? " ' Elisabet clapped her hands and danced up and down as Sigrid reached for long and short handled pots and skillets , heart-shaped molds and round molds and oval molds . Removing the copper-45ware from above and to each side of the fireplace was like removingthe china and silverware from a banquet table . Bare it looked , yes . But as the exquisite woven pattern on damask would satisfy the eye on a cleared board , so did the faultless lines of the corner fireplace cause Sigrid to look again and again , and stand back with her hands on her hips , to drink in the beauty of this plain but wonderful work of her ancestors . The corner was not only a raised hearthstone of well-worn brick with the deep hearth and the brick sides partially covered with white plaster , not only an overhanging flue of the plastered brick following the lines of the raised hearthstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oak . It was not only a place to build a fire , with at one side a recess for storing small kindling and at the other side the built-in oven . It was a thing alive , giving warmth and cheer and warm water , and cooked and baked foods . What wealth a fireplace was ! What infinite wealth . Sigrid thought of what a dreary place four walls could be without a fireplace . Happiness and health were born and thrived at this center , this very heart , of the home . Into a large woven basket went the pots and Sigrid carried them to the shed with Elisabet holding one side of the basket , sure she was bearing a full share of the weight . A napkin-sized dampened flannel cloth in the hand of the mother and a saucer-sized cloth in the hand of the daughter , each dipped into fine ashes , then rubbed and rubbed around and inside of the cooking vessels , soon made them shine like mirrors . The mother and child put their faces close together and grimaced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sang as they worked . But one thought tormented her . How should she greet Peter ? When he returned , what should she say to him ? IIow could she appear nonchalant , and how could she control her feelings and not show her hurt and humiliation ? " Pot  --  coffee pot  --  " Elisabet tugged at her mother 's skirts and pointed to the coffee pot . " What would mama do without her little helper ? Here we46would have a dull old coffee pot if it was n't for your bright little eyes ! " Pleased , the child stayed close to Sigrid , giving her little help with every turn of hand . The sound of oars ! Sigrid froze where she was standing , then broke out into a sweat and felt the awful sensation of seeming to have everything inside of her drop several inches . She clenched her hands , steadied herself on her feet , took a deep breath and spoke softly , " Lissie , dear , papa is coming home . Let us cook him a nice hot cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cookie jar . Would you like some , too , and a glass of milk ? " Sigrid set a large tray . Her best china graced this tray with a beautiful old Swedish glass tumbler , pale , smoky gray , for the milk . Little Finnish breads  --  rich , buttery , thumb-sized shortbreadstopped with slivered nuts  --  she arranged in a double cartwheelon a fine lace doily over a silver plate . The tea was hot and ready to pour . But Peter did not come in . Sigrid reached the outer door just in time to see Peter 's back as he disappeared into the barn . Why did he not come into the house ? He would have to meet the moment of greeting sooner or later . Should she go out and make the first gesture of welcome ? No ! This she could not bring herself to do . Each waiting minute was torture , but she would wait . He , it was , who should make any overture toward a forgiveness she hoped she would be big enough to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard them . But who  --  ? Oh , God ! Could it be  --  ? Sigrid could have prostrated herself in thanks to God for what she hoped , but instead she picked Elisabet up in her arms and ran wildly , hysterically , to the boat landing . " Morfar , oh  --  Morfar  --  " and as he came toward her , she threw herself into his arms , alternately laughing and sobbing . " See'ri , my dear , my dear  --  " giving her name the soft , **25;6006;TOOLONG , he held her close and stroked her hair back from her forehead . " See'ri , it is good to come home . " How big my little Elisabet has grown ! " The old man picked her up with his hands under her armpits and raised her high above his head , then down to the ground , then up again  --  time after time  --  until they were both almost breathless from the exertion and the laughing . Sigrid was content just to stand and look at him . Proudly she watched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stoops to the height of the child as he is when his over six feet gives commands to his men . " There were two , who had served with him  --  who were always glad for another visit to Norden  --  who had offered to row him to the island and carry his luggage and the stores he brought with him . She knew how they worshipped the old Captain , and she remembered how they had cried at his retirement , sure they would never know another senior officer who would be so kind , so big-hearted , so generous and tolerant . Up and down her grandfather bounced her daughter on his arm as they walked toward the house , Sigrid keeping pace alongside , listening to their chattering and laughter . " You boys should use the wagon , or you will have to make several trips before you get all of the boxes up . " " Oh , we are strong  --  see ? " And the sailors set down the luggage and flexed their arms , pounding their muscles , " These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . It is like old times to be near Captain Ivarsson , although this boat was a bit small . " Sigrid knew that each of the men , in his mind 's eye , saw the same picture she did  --  the sturdy Captain standing on the bridge of his sea-going vessel  --  his hand on the wheel , his keen eyes searching the sea . " Papa gone . " Morfar Karl stopped . Crestfallen , realizing he had been guilty of committing an awful blunder , he asked , " Where is Peter ? I am sorry I neglected to ask . " " Oh , he is in the barn . He will be along . I guess he has not heard us yet . " Sigrid was ashamed too . She had forgotten Peter entirely. 48 " And Morfar  --  the new baby  --  " " Tell me , tell me  --  " " His name is Karl . " Slowly he set Elisabet down . Slowly he took Sigrid in his arms again , looked deep into her eyes , leaned down and kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an angel . " His name is Karl ! I am glad for you Sigrid . You have a son . His name is Karl ! Thank you , Sigrid , thank you  --  thank you . " I am , indeed , a happy man . " Inside the house , first he must look at his great-grandson . He was so big and the baby so little . Yes , her grandfather was big , big in his bodily proportions , big in his human relationships , big in his thoughts and accomplishments . No man ever had more men call him friend than Karl Ivarsson . " And that is a good enough measuring rod for me , " thought Sigrid as she busied herself setting the table , adding to the Finnish breads and tea a spread of sylta and lingon , cold kory and cheese , salt herring , hard-boiled eggs and kndckebrod and butter . After the last load was carried to the shed , the sailors went to the barn to tell Peter to come and join them all in a bite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting which he did not return . The grandfather rose , walked across the room and reaching for Peter 's hand , shook it warmly and said , " It is good to see you , Peter . " Sigrid looked hard at her husband . No , he was not as tall as he had been before last Sunday . She could fight against it , but she could not deny it , the words Peter had spoken in the churchyardhad dwarfed him in her sight . Nor did he grow in height as he answered , " I am glad you have come . Now maybe we can drink some coffee once in a while instead of tea , tea , tea . " " Come , sit , " called Sigrid . They sat around the board , and Sigrid asked , " Morfar , will you say the blessing ? " The white head bent over the infant he held in his lap , " Our table now with food is spread ; Oh , God , who givest daily bread , Bless these Thy gifts unto us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49It was a cheery meal . The sailors joked about being in drydock to have the barnacles scraped from their bottoms , and told tales of visits to foreign ports where mermaids swam in phosphorescent waters . " None of you was ever smart enough to bring one home . You have brought monkeys and goats and cats and cockatoos and parrots  --  butthat I know of , no mermaid ever set tail upon my ship . " " That reminds me , " spoke Johann the sailor , " I brought the little girl a pet ! " Up from the table , out to the shed and in again he came with a large heavy wire cage . In the lower center of the cage was a goodsizedcircular treadmill , and a swinging trapeze bar at each of the upper two ends . A small squirrel ran briskly with turn after turn of the treadmill , then jumped to one trapeze bar , turned , sprang to the other , and repeated the performance over and over again . " It is for you , Elisabet , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It seems cruel to keep it caged that way . " " Oh , no , Sigrid  --  Fru Kristiansson  --  squirrels are very happy caged . They do not then have to forage for their food , nor hide from vicious enemies , nor freeze in the winter 's cold . " An approving glance from Morfar Karl decided Sigrid . " You are very kind to remember Elisabet so . Say tack to Johann , Lissie . " Let us name him Kiki , this ekorre . Kiki is your very own pet , just as Hjarta is Karl 's , " and she told them all  --  telling especially her grandfather  --  of the colt and how he was to belong to little Karl , how he was waiting impatiently for the boy to grow large enough to sit upon his back and ride . Hours passed as they visited , Sigrid 's knitting needles playing an obligato to the pleasant voices . Soon the sailors must leave . The two good friendsJohann and Georg . Sigrid measured the appearance of one with the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift in his movements . A Viking  --  masculine in the extreme  --  yet almost woman-like in his tenderness , child-like in his reverence . And Georg  --  Little Georg they called him  --  small body , short50legs , big hands , big feet  --  red-complexioned with clear light blue eyes , sandy hair , and a long heavy drooping mustache . They called him stingy too , but it was not stingy that he was . He was saving ; saving for the day when he could marry his Selma , his girl who lived in Lappland , his affianced bride who to Little Georg held high place . First with him was Selma , second was God , third was Johann  --  these the triumvirate  --  guiding his life , his philosophy , in which all was good , all well with the world . A ready smile lighted his features . His friendship for Johann amounted almost to worship . Now they must leave . Sigrid assured them there was sleeping room for all , but with smiles they bade adieu saying , " We do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby in his cradle and sat beside it , one hand keeping up the steady back and forward motion . This cradle , in which Sigrid had been rocked , and her mother , and his own dear Sigrid  --  this Sigrid 's grandmother  --  this cradle , showing the date of its making , sixteen hundred and ninety-four . The date remained only because it had been carved deeper than the name of the child for whom it had been made . His still keen eyes tried to decipher the letters of the name , but the lines were too worn . There was a " V " or was it a " U , " and an " o , " but the remaining were merely tired lines almost obliterated by Time . It was a crude cradle , but what good service it had given ! Made of five hand-hewn oaken boards , one was the bottom , two were the sides , and two the ends . The hewing marks still showed on the oak boards and the patina was rich as only it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with loving care . His beard moved with the smile which came as he visualized the slap which must have stopped the cutting of the childish game on the side of the cradle . Four little lines cut , two parallel horizontally and two parallel vertically , to allow the placing of an " X " or an " 0 " with the hope of being able to place three " X 's " or three " O 's " in a row . There they were  --  and in the center square an " X , " one " 0 " in the upper right hand square , but only half an " X " in the upper left hand square ! Whose slap had stopped the hand that would have finished the " X " ? Whose hand had cut it ? 51It had been there when first he came to Norden . This cradle with the rockers running the long way instead of sidewise as all good cradles should be made , what memories it called to mind ! he guessed he was getting old , sitting by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear some of his thoughts would hurt too much , half afraid not to think of the past for fear he would lose it " Are you not anxious to see what I have brought you ? " " Anxious , yes , but not anxious enough to want to disturb the picture you make . It is so pleasant just sitting here watching , just looking at you and little Karl and Lissie talking to her new pet , and Peter . There is time tomorrow to enjoy opening the boxes . Let us enjoy each other today . " She knitted , and they talked of the days he was away . She told him of Karl 's birth and the deep snow , and of how Peter had cut the snow tunnel and cared for the barn and the stock . All the good she told him . And she had to feel to pass the slip stitch over the knit stitch on the instep of the sock she was knitting for Peter , because her eyes were too full of teardrops to see , when her grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Perhaps it is natural for a man , unconsciously , to do injustice to the one who comes to claim the hand of a beloved flicka . I could not know , I did not know you well . Reluctantly , I admit I worried about Sigrid and how she would fare with you as her husband . My apologies to you , sir , for my unspoken faint feeling of insecurity . It is good to know  --  Even now as I came home , you were so busy in the barn , you did not hear the noise and clatter we made . It is good to shake the hand of a good man . " Even as he spoke , he began to doubt the truth of his words . Was this rigid economy of speech practiced by Peter a means of hiding something  --  something more than his past ? Was his granddaughterputting up a bold front for his benefit ? Was Peter all she was trying to lead him to believe he was ? The teardrop which fell as he glanced in Sigrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take Elisabet for a horseback ride . As he had seen old friends in England trot their children to " ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross to See a fine lady on a white horse , " so he crossed52his legs and set Lissie upon the uppermost foot , Swedish fashion , and in sing-song voice , " Rida , rida ranka , Hasten heter Blanka . " Hvar ska vi rida ? Till en liten piga . " Hvad ska hon heta ? Anna Margareta . " Den tjocka och f eta Da ska du veil veta . " Mir vi kom dit , Var der ingen hemma " Bara en liten skata , Som gick och sopa gata , " Och tva fattiga hundar Som lag under en bank . " Den story sa vov vov ' Den lilla sa jepp , jepp . ' " As she rode on the horse named Blanka , to visit the little maidservantAnna Margareta , Elisabet grew sad when she learned that upon arrival no one was at home , and then brightened at " except a little magpie who went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid under the bench . " And when the big dog said " vov vov " and the little dog " jepp jepp , " she screeched with laughter ! Again and again she asked for " Rida , rida ranka , " hoisting one leg trying to straddle the old man 's foot . Again and again he rode her up and down , enjoying it all as much as did she . Sigrid drew on her barn coat and thought of how her grandfather'scoming seemed to solve all problems . She would now never mention to Peter his transgression , his insult to her , his disloyalty . She would try to wipe it from her memory so that she would never give a thought to it again in her lifetime  --  now that the family circle was unbroken and serene  --  now that she saw Peter with just the slightest look of a trapped animal in the direction of Morfar Karl , rise from his chair , draw on his outdoor clothes , and leave the room as she did . It did not matter that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was accustomed to doing the work in the barn . She was glad because her grandfather , in his own goodness , brought out the best in others . Peter wanted Morfar to think well of him or he would not have come with her , leaving behind him the impression that he was going to help with the barn work . " I will try to understand him . I will try harder than I 've tried for anything , ever , so understanding him I can be a good wife to him . " Understand Peter ? No . Sigrid never could have understood the hatred for her he took with him toward the orchard , hatred born of jealousy and bitter disappointment . He stopped and kicked a piece of loose bark from the trunk of an old apple tree , then turned to look down over the dwelling house and the barns . Here he had come , thinking that when he married the daughter of Norden , he would be master of this place ; and his pockets  --  if not filled  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to laugh . He did not have the benefits of the name , why then should he play the game ? Why should he put his shoulder to the wheel when he was no more truly master than the youngest suckling pig ? True , she did not openly cross him in words . But the house and barns and farm ran as smoothly whether he said a word or did not , or if he moved from his kubbstol , or did not . He was not needed here . Until she treated him as master , let her do the work . Perhaps when the old man was gone , perhaps then he could put her in her place and step into his rightful one as Master of Norden . Peter straightened his tall frame as he thought of that time . Yes , he had plenty here . Plenty to eat , provided by sky , sea , and earth , but how could he go to the mainland and see his old friends with no money in his pockets ? What little money ever came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customed shoes for wearing to church , and the weekly contribution to the poor box . And by whom was it set aside ? Not by him , the one who should be master of the house. 54No . By her . Master ! Only in the bed . Yes , he was master in the bed , and he gloried in this . Yes , he was master there , and make the most of it , he would ! Captain Karl Ivarsson sat by the fireplace , a child on each arm , well-fed and happy and watching his granddaughter move swiftly around the room , marvelling at her capabilities and her versatility , wondering at her serenity , and praying for her happiness . Sigrid prepared the baby for the night , but Elisabet did not want to leave the grandfather 's arms . " Let her sleep with me . " We will sleep well together in the spare bedroom , will we not , Lissie ? " The child put her arms tightly around the old man 's neck and giggled as his beard tickled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went together to the spare bedroom , to sleep in the beautiful Gustavian bed which stood like a chair in the daytimewith its handsome carved legs , and feet like huge bird claws clutching round balls of wood . Sigrid had drawn it out to its full length and spread it , after warming the sheets and coverlets . Tuckingthem in like two children , she left the room hearing her grandfatherhum a lullaby ; but soon she knew they were both fast asleep . Beside Peter and little Karl she lay on the bunk bed . No need to draw the bed curtains now that spring had come . She lay , dreamily watching the embers glow in the grate , until sleep came. 55VIION Goon FRIDAY it was proper that they fast and pray . The past two years , Peter and Sigrid had spent the day in church , and no food or drink had passed their lips . But today Peter said they could and would hold their prayers at home . " He admits his shame to the church-goers by staying away , " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better this way . Perhaps Peter knows best . If we went to church today maybe it would seem that he is bold , too bold , that he thinks nothing of his behavior of last Sunday . " The gifts lay in the shed where Johann and his friend had stacked them . Sigrid had forgotten , last night , in her excitement over Morfar 's return that today would not allow the pleasure of opening the boxes . She was absent from many of the prayers of the morning , spendingthe better part of the forenoon in the barn helping Lisa deliver her calf . Lisa was determined to eat the afterbirth and Sigrid was just as set on taking it away from the cow , so she could use the milk in the house at once . Everyone knew except Lisa it seemed , that folks could n't drink cow 's milk for three days after the mother56cow had eaten the afterbirth . So she struggled with the old cow , putting the iron shovel close to her nose , pushing with all her strength against the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lisa 's mouth . " It is not so much that you are very strong , Lisa , it is just that I am weak for want of breakfast ! " She patted the cow , then , and talked to her , " Good old Lisa , giving us a heifer calf . A boy-baby , a girl-calf , who could ask that a year treat a family better than this ? " She left the barn and joined the family in the prayers which absorbed Peter 's day . At times he would tell them all to bow their heads wherever they were , while he read passages from the Bible and prayed , or tell them to gather close while he read and prayed , and Sigrid noticed as the day wore on that his face became less hangdog-looking and the bloodshot eyes cleared . In the late afternoon Morfar saw that she grew faint and tired and insisted that she have food to break the fast , that it was fine for a man to sit by the fire and take care of babies  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman who had not only herself , but a big baby boy to feed , must eat . " What would he say , I wonder , if he knew of the next baby , which I am sure is also asking for nourishment ? " So she set the big copper pot on the trivet , and into it poured two quarts of homemade beer , and when it steamed , thickened it with flour-and-water paste . Her grandfather nodded acquiescence when she boasted , " You can always tell a good cook , because she never gets lumps when she thickens with flour paste . " She did not smile because it would have made Peter irritable if she had smiled on Good Friday . When the beer boiled she removedit from the fire , waited until all the bubbling stopped , then slowly added an equal amount of fresh milk , stirring the mixture constantly with a large wooden spoon . Not a curdle was there in the soup , as at last she added a spoonful of molasses . They all ate of it , Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sigrid thought , " It is n't good ! At least I do not like it . I think nobody really likes it . But then , I suppose that is why we never must eat anything but beer soppa on Good Friday . As Peter says , it is not suitable that we enjoy anything on this sorrowful day . " 57But Easter Eve  --  how different ! Sigrid and her grandfather rose from their beds at four o'clock . Nothing would do but he must delve into a box or two until he found a smaller box marked Coffee , open it , fill the coffee grinder , sit with it between his knees , and while he ground , whistle a squeaky tune to imitate a hand-organ grinder with a monkey such as had entertained him in a French port . Sigrid made coffee in the big pot , half afraid the pungent smell of newly ground coffee beans would awaken Peter before she could spend a little time reading , with her grandfather . And as she dropped a piece of dried fishskin into the pot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wondered how anyone could sleep with this heavenly aroma within smelling distance . They sat at the fireplace , grandfather and granddaughter , feet up on the hearthstone , drinking coffee ; he telling her of foreign cities and people , and she picturing to him all the homely happeningsof her daily life . She told him of her hopes for the future , giving him her little diary to read and the notes she had written him of her joy at the birth of her son , and of the christening day . Such a pleasant morning they enjoyed , the only flaw being when she drew from him the admission that he had been unable to come upon a doctor who would be willing to attempt the removalof Elisabet 's birthmark . " They said the size of the skin graft would necessarily be so large . " " I know , " she answered him , trying hard to keep her eyes from filling with tears . But hope was not dead . Here sat Morfar telling that one of the doctors had vowed he would keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever met a surgeon who would take the chanceShe would concentrate on that possibility . She would pray . . . . Karl was the first to awaken to demand attention , then Peter , and lastly Elisabet who came running to the old grandfather 's arms begging , " Lissie fly high  --  in sky . " So up she went , his little bird , away up over his head  --  thrown up into the air  --  and caught again in his large hands . Easter Eve . All was happiness in anticipation of the joyous morrow. 58As Sigrid called them to the Easter Eve table , she asked , " What shall we give as the prize to the one who can eat the most eggs ? " " I will give the prize . I am sure I have just the proper prize in one of those boxes there , for whoever is able to eat the largest number . " Hard-boiled eggs , coffee , and knackebrod ! Her mother filled a cup almost full of milk and added only enough coffee to fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grown-up folk . Graceful bouquets decorated the board , in vases filled with " flowers " of pink , yellow , violet , and red dyed chicken feathers tied to young birch branches . They seated themselves around the board . On the center of each individual plate squatted an egg dressed in a crocheted cover , made with a comb of red wool , so it looked exactly like a chicken . These were conversation-warmers as well as eggwarmers ! Morfar said they looked so real he expected to hear a cackle any minute . The large bowl full of hard-boiled eggs in the center of the table , from which all helped themselves , was a challenge to the appetites of this little family , as the decorating had been a challengeto Sigrid 's education in art . Each egg she had painted to tell a story from the Bible . And each egg prompted the telling of the Bible story it illustrated , so Peter became the chief storytellerof the day . They lingered at the table for hours , Sigrid making another big pot of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily had won the contest by eating fourteen eggs . After the meal , Peter 's offer to help Morfar undo the boxes in the shed was accepted promptly , and he carried packages into the large room , stacking them against the wall near the fireplace . Fascinated , Sigrid watched her husband 's eagerness , and then Morfar called , " Leave the dishwashing , Sigrid . Come and see the prize your good husband has won . " Peter sat opening the wrappings of heavy sacking and found an article made of birch wood , polished to a satin finish , made to hang on the wall in a corner . The two sides were at right angles to each other , shaped with fine curving edges and with two little59shelves notched in the fronts , and a rounded-front cupboard space below with a small neatly knobbed drawer in the center . At his look of helpless inquiry , Sigrid responded quickly and came to his rescue with , " A pipe rack , what a beautiful pipe rack ! " Sure enough , there were notches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the drawer was made to hold tobacco . Sigrid luxuriated in watching the pleased expression on Peter 's face as she heard him say it was indeed a fine present , and she thrilled at his interest when he asked the old Captain where it had been made . " It comes to you from Vastergotland . I am glad you like it , Peter . " Peter liked , too , the new pipe he found in the little drawer , and the goodly store of tobacco . Oh , it was a gift-giving day , to be sure . For Sigrid , Morfar had brought yards of blue silk so she should have a silk dress like other " beautiful women , " and pounds and pounds of coffee , and indigo dyes and red and green and yellow dyes . And the spices ! " Without which no baking would be complete , " said Sigrid to herself . When she opened the package of pins he brought her , straight pins with fine needle points , her grandfather picked Elisabet up and put her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sol mi sol sol , sol fa la la , la si si la , si do re me , " tried to teach her to sing the early English folk song , " I 'll give to you a paper of pins And that is how our love begins , If you will marry , marry me  --  If you will marry me . " " It was not only then that pins were worth their weight in gold , " she said , and he was pleased at her way of thanking him . She unwrapped another parcel , removed the gift and held it in her lap and caressed it and looked at it in solemn wonder  --  a smoothing iron that worked with heat . Oh , yes , she had heard and read of heated smoothing irons , but never had she dreamed of owning one. 60Her smoothing board , which she used when she did not for one reason or another use the community mangle , was a flat board with a carved handle . For that matter the top too was carved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore the crudely cut reminder , " Use me well and soon your prince will come a-riding . " With a little imagination , the handle became the prince 's mount . It was carved to represent a horse . It had been her mother 's before her . It was very old . But this smoothing iron was made of cast brass , the business part of it about the size of a man 's hand , and with a gently rounded front . About an inch and a half deep , it had an opening at the back out of which came an iron core  --  to be heated in the fire , Morfar said  --  and when red hot , to be replaced in the brass iron with a small pair of tongs . He showed her how to close the hinged cover , or door , over the opening and how to fasten it with a small brass hook which he slid into place over an eye . Had his hands always trembled so ? She watched them as he pointed out that her hand would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden handle , turned to fit the palm and supported a good six inches above the iron itself by tall brass standards . It was a pretty thing , shiny brass , with the Last Supper cast into the brass of the little rectangular door . How she danced around the room , like a little child , after she opened the parcel containing a complete , professional-looking set of carving tools for wood , and heard her grandfather say , " You have done such beautiful work with makeshift tools , See'ri  --  " Truly the Swedish craft of woodcarving had been transmitted to those fingers there , fondling the little carving tools , Morfar knew as he finished , "  --  let us see what you can carve with these . " For Elisabet there was a little French doll , exquisite , which Sigrid thought should best be placed in one of the chests until the little daughter was a bit older , and a pair of gold earrings , plain gold circlets . " Like your mother wears , " said Morfar . As surely as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him , and like her mother wore  --  and my Sigrid  --  " Of course , the child must have her ears pierced at once so she should lose no time in wearing the earrings . What better day to initiate their wearing than on the morrow , Easter Sunday ? 61Sigrid dipped a length of linen thread into hot wax , let it cool , and threaded a short bit of it through each ear lobe after piercing the lobes with a red hot needle , and tied the ends into a secure square knot . She knew her daughter must have inherited some of her great-grandfather 's strength and courage , as never a whimper came nor did the child cringe as the old man held her and Sigrid squeezed the blood from the lobes and held them tight while she jabbed the needle through the soft flesh . A chill ran through her as she tried to console herself for the hurt she was causing by assuringherself that " the younger they are , the less it hurts . " There was not even a tiny trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lissic be pretty . " Then Morfar encouraged the child to dig through his pockets to find her piece de resistance . Climbing over him , going through one pocket and then another , at last she found the harmonica . Morfar was sure she had a gift for music when she caught on readily to his trick of breathing in and breathing out , to make the sounds of the different notes of the scale . They sat , listening to him play , the mouth organ sliding from side to side across the expanse of white beard , his foot tapping the time against the white pine floor . Far removed from the room were they all , away in a cold stone castle , as Sigrid joined in singingthe old saga of Brynhilda 's love and the wrath of Gudrun . Then the old Captain took them in fancy to the land of the Edelweissflower and played the song of a Swiss mountaineer courting his lass ; and Sigrid  --  near to ecstasy  --  thrilled to hear her husband add his clear voice to yodel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow with the thin , eery , but beautiful voice of the echo . How she wished she did not experience the want of confidence to tell him how fine a voice his was , how joining in the pleasure of the music transformed his features . But she was afraid to break the spell , afraid he would sink again into that cellar of silence if she praised him . The day flew by , ending with her serving of the triiditional smorgasbord . Long strips of sill , or salt herring , she cut ar , d rolled into fancy shapes , and little round pieces of limpa she topped with circles of whites of hard-boiled eggs left over from their br akfast , 62and in the center of the circles squeezed the crumbed yolks out through the sprits cookie press so they looked like flowers . Some of the limpa she cut heart-shaped and garnished with sylta . Smoked eel she cut thin , and laid one piece partially over the other , to make a pattern of fish slices on a long narrow platter . Coffee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter Eve supper . Before the dawn came Sigrid was up , doing the chores and enjoying the morning . She picked up her yarns to dust the top of a small table and smiled as she thought of how near she had come yesterday , to forgetting her plans for giving , and thought of them only when Morfar suddenly remembered he had another gift for her , a set of five long whalebone needles for knitting long warm winter underwear . Her gifts , of course ! After supper she had gone to the kistehuset , the extra sleeping room used as a chest room , next to the spare bedroom where Morfar slept , in which stood all of the chests so beautifully carved and painted , and brought out her handiwork . Six pairs of knitted socks for her grandfather , mittens , gloves , a fringed scarf , and twelve fine white linen handkerchiefs each hemstitched with a hem almost an inch wide , with diminutive stitches catching three threads of the cloth into each hemming stitch . There were new gloves for Peter , white handkerchiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , a white linen shirt with half-inch tucks neatly back-stitched to form a " dress " bosom . " And this is Easter Day . Paskdagen . " She wondered if they would wear their new shirts to church today . Day was beginning to dawn , light showed in the east , and it promised to be a clear day . Sigrid poked the fire and planned her day . She would get through the morning chores as quickly as possible , so she could make the children and herself ready in their church clothes . They would have breakfast on their return , after partaking of Easter Communion , but she could spread the tableWhen she came from the barn the two men were dressed , each proudly in his new tucked white shirt . " The new calf does not seem to be so fine this morning . Lisa seemed so uninterested in the poor little thing . Do you think , Peter , that I should stay at home and make sure it nurses as it63should ? I did not see it nurse at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stall . " " No . There is no good that you can do . The cow will take care of her own . We do not have much luck in having well-born young  --  in the house  --  or in the barn . " " But I  --  " " No ! Of all days , you must not stay at home today . " She dressed in her church clothes , and Morfar helped her with the children while Peter hitched up the horse . Off they went , this clear sunshiny Easter morning . Peter held the horse 's bit while Morfar with Karl on his arm , hat in hand , helped Sigrid into the carriage . Then he lifted up the baby , swung Elisabet up beside her mother , and he with the tapestry bag , stepped into the front and sat alongside the driver 's seat . Before he settled himself he reached back to make sure Elisabet was safe on the seat beside her mother . Easter Day . Paskdagen . The inspiring church building , the beauty of the elaborate old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ReverendOskarsstrom and turned ever so slightly as he went from communicantto communicant , the friendly greetings from young and old alike , the respect and adoration paid to Morfar , her pride at being at his side , her lovable children , a husband who had fathered her a son , all these made Sigrid 's heart sing with the joyous spirit of the day as her voice sang with the congregation . And as she joined in prayer , her inner voice added , " Easter . The day of the Resurrection of Our Lord , the day of the renewal of all hope ! What greater proof than that given to me in these past days ? " Her grandfather bent his tall body until his whisper met her ear , " Faith . Faith is the answer , dear See'ri . No ill can touch you if you have Faith . " Her first thought on returning home was of the new calf . " Morfar  --  Peter  --  will you carry the children into the house , and I will stop in the barn to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 64 " In your church clothes , Sigrid ? " " I will not stay , Peter . I will just look in  --  " " Oh , it 's dead by now , that is sure . Come and get our breakfast ready . " Sigrid turned toward the barn , hearing her grandfather say , " Go ahead , put your mind at rest . I will start cooking the coffee . You hurry in , Sigrid . We are all hungry , even Karl , " as Karl started to scream . Sigrid stopped , crestfallen , as she saw the little calf , with eyes closed , lying limp in the corner of the dropping stall . Lisa , her back turned , stood munching feed in the opposite corner . She bent over the little animal and felt that although it was warm , the heartbeat seemed very tired . She ran to the house , and once inside , spread the breakfast on the table , changed the children 's clothing and her own , and turned from one necessary chore to another with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse Karl as I eat ; there is no time to waste . I must hurry out to the calf to see if I can help to bring a little life back into its body . It seems so near gone  --  " " If anyone could save it , you can , " said her grandfather . He saw the sneer draw up one side of Peter 's mouth , and that mouth utter , " Throw it out behind the barn and we can burn it tomorrow  --  or throw it into the sea . " " It will not die , See'ri . With your faith and love , you will save it . You are so full of life yourself , you will be able to impart enough to the little calf to renew its hold . " The men lingered over their coffee cups as Sigrid laid Elisabet and Karl on the bunk bed to nap , and went back to the barn . " Come , Lisa  --  come and give your baby some milk . " She pulled and tugged at the cow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pushed the cow toward it , but Lisa would have none of it . Sigrid tried to pick the calf up in her arms to bring it to the mother , but she was not strong enough to lift it . So she edged it over onto a piece of sacking and pulled it over to the cow , but Lisa backed away , and when Sigrid forced her head down to65smell of the calf so she should know it was truly her offspring , Lisa snorted and blew air from her nostrils like an angry bull , and turned away . With firm steps and determined movements , Sigrid reached for a long leather harness strap . She backed Lisa against the stanchionand tied her by the neck , tight , to the boards . Then she tore sacking into long strips , knotted them together , and with the lengths around the rear end of the cow , tied her so she could not get away . Sigrid dragged the calf over , sat down on the floor , and pulled the calf up onto her lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly into the smallish mouth held open wide with the fingers of her other hand . But the calf showed no signs of life . " Dear little baby calf , please  --  please , drink . " With a piece of the rough sacking Sigrid rubbed the calf , strokingits head and rubbing with all her strength to stimulate circulation . She had watched cows do just this with their tongues on their new-born . For hours she rubbed , and to rest her arms she alternately held open the calf 's mouth and directed the milk into the opening . But the milk ran out as the droopy head toppled over the side of her supporting arm . Sigrid grew discouraged . " What more can I do  --  ? " She looked pleadingly at Lisa , who glared down at her as though she would like to give her a swift kick . " Oh , Lisa , your calf must live . Do you not know this is Easter ? Do you not know this is the season of Hope and Joy and Life ? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sigrid walked disconsolately back to the house and prepared the evening meal of smoked salmon , hard-boiled eggs , coffee , tender young nettles  --  the first of the season  --  and she was thankful her grandfather was there so she could feel assured that the babies were well looked after , as without joining them at the table , she went back to the barn . Since early afternoon she had worked with the calf . Lisa was beginning to show her anger , and swished her tail full into Sigrid's66face time after time , as she lifted her leg and tried to kick where a kick might be of some assistance in releasing her . It was almost midnight . The Easter fires still burned brightly on the mountains on the mainland . Sigrid 's body swayed with the movement of the rubbing , and the movement lent a jerky sound to her voice as she raised her eyes to the rafters , " Dear God , do not let death come to cloud this Easter Day . You have been so good to me . Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that I am not what Peter says I am . Help me to have faith in myself too , I , who have so much faith in You . " Just before dawn the little calf opened its eyes . Sigrid tried again squirting milk from the mother into its mouth , and it swallowed . She let the stream come , and watched the contraction of the neck muscles as the little animal swallowed again and again . Sigrid massaged now with new vigor . Lisa turned an inquiring eye , and struggled to loose herself . When the calf held its head erect , Lisa turned her rear quickly and broke the bindings , so Sigrid released the neck strap , and the cow nosed down to the calf and licked its face , its neck , and its body . The calf would live ! Sigrid knew now , if ever she had doubted , that " as long as she had Faith " nothing ever really could hurt her . She knew she would look back upon this day through all the days of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; remembrance of this day , and of yesterday , would carry her through . " I have lived  --  lived life to the fullest " I have known perfect days . " 67VIIISIGnID LEANED THE LAST of a row of well-scrubbed chambersagainst the low stone fence , at an angle to catch the morning sun full in each bowl . There was Elisabet 's dainty china pot with painted forget-me-nots , the heavy earthenware chamber which she and Peter used at night , and the tall enamelled-ware jar with a wide rim to help support her grandfather when he sat . " I see him failing day by day , " she thought , " but I will not let myself think of what life will be without him . " Woodbines interlaced in the stone fence made a dancing patternin the early light , and their leaves swished against the stones in the gentle breeze . Only this broke the stillness , the solitude , as Sigrid surveyed her home place . There stood the house looking down upon the barn . Its casementwindows were outlined in white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one white frame , satisfied to hide its diminished head in this season of the out-of-doors , smug in the satisfaction of knowing only itself could bring summer blooms to cheer the long winter . Beyond the house and to the south spare windswept apple , 68pear , plum , and cherry trees became the orchard and provided a background for the dwelling . Ever-present stone fences separated the house from the orchard , enclosed the houseyard , surrounded the barnyard , and continued around the entire farm separating pastures , rye fields , barley fields , and wheat fields . " I wonder if I had been the one to come here , those many years ago , if I would have had the wisdom to clear the land of stones in this way , and put the stones to such practical use ? " mused Sigrid . A good five times as big as the house , below and to the north , ran the barn . Ell-shaped , its main body was built of three thicknessesof large bricks to the eaves , with the gable repeating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors were arched at the tops and smaller , narrow bricks were laid in pattern vertically to form the arches . Strap hinges swung the russet-colored doors and shutters , and there were no panes of glass . Large doors to the hay mow , in the gable , swung with handwroughtiron hinges  --  four of them  --  naming the farm , the province , the country Sverige , and the year of the barn 's building , in the crude smithing of the iron . The wing , an afterthought , repeated the timber 's use and color of the house . All of the roofs were thatched and had been secured at the peaks with short , uneven , hand-hewn timbers laid alongside each other like fence pickets . Many a time Sigrid had started to count them , reached fifty-six or fifty-seven or fifty-eight on one roof slope of the main barn , and as they then danced against the bright sky before her eyes so she could not be sure that she had counted this one or that one , had given up , deciding that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew everywhere . One frail aspen tree grew in the houseyard , but the beautiful birches and the pines and firs were far from the dwelling . As far as her eyes could see stretched the land of her home place , her island farm , Norden . Cows grazed contentedly in the pastures and the horses frisked about , now and again rolling over on their backs with feet kicking up into the air , glad for the respite from farm work which Sigrid 's washing days allowed them. 69Yes , Norden was a fine place to live . And this was a fine day to finish the work of laundering . All of the accumulation of household linens from the winter was gathered for this first general washday of the spring . Five tubs full of white clothing and linens stood in the washyard  --  thispart of the houseyard floored with smooth small white stones  --  large wooden tubs , their staves braced round about with iron hoops . Low , near the bottom of each , the draining holes were stoppered each with a bung . Days necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty clothes . The first day she had folded the linens , layers of them , into the tubs and covered them with rain water to let stand through the day and overnight , and soak . On the second day , early in the morning , she had unstopped the bungholes and drained the water from that first soaking . Removing each piece from one tub at a time she had rubbed her homemade soap on every surface of the cloths and garments , rubbed the soiled parts between her hands and replaced the linens in the tubs , each piece folded and spread out smooth with the palms of her hands  --  layer on layer  --  and covered them again with fresh rain water . Of course the woolens she would wash separately . Sigrid now took mental inventory . In these tubs there were twenty-six tablecloths , fiftyfivebedsheets , fifty pillowslips  --  " and oh , there must be hundreds of towels and serviettes "  --  and the recent changes of men 's white shirts , her chemises , her night-shifts and the men 's  --  knee length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor hearth , nothing more than a pile of stones built up to support a huge iron kettle . Water boiled with sifted ashes made a brownish lye water which she poured over the clothes , let stand , drained off , and repeatedagain and again , letting the last cover of lye water stand on them over the night . Five bungs came out and five tubs were drained of lye water . " While they are draining , I will clean up the barn . It will smell sweet after the fumes of lye . " As she walked to the barn , she saw Lisa 's calf . Pask , she had named it . Now it bore not much resemblance to the poor , weak , half-numb , half-dead , lukewarm bit of hide and flesh of Easter morning. 70'Task , you are a fine young calf , and you , Hjiirta  --  " She rubbed her cheek against the smooth short hair of the colt 's nose and he licked her with his tongue . " Let 's see if you can dance today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran , and rolled his lips back and looked as if he were laughing . Sigrid brought in the cows to be milked and turned them loose again to graze in the sunshine , swept the barn clean , and skipped to the house to awaken her family for breakfast . As she neared the door , her nostrils dilated . Coffee ! " Morfar , you have breakfast all ready ! And Lissie , you are up and dressed ! And Karl  --  " Contentedly he lay in his cradle sucking on a sugar-tit the old Captain had made for him by soaking a small piece of brown bread in milk and adding sugar and enclosing it all in a clean small piece of linen cloth , twisted and tied so the bulbous end holding the bread would fit perfectly into the baby 's mouth and serve as a pacifier . " It is little enough I can do . " But he was glad that she was pleased . He turned to Elisabet , " Come , it is ready . Eat hearty , little Elisabet , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , Peter , coffee is ready , " Sigrid called . The talk was of the fun they would have wading in the clear water of the lake , and of the wagon ride . " I wonder if the creek that feeds the lake has changed its path since these buildings were made , " said Sigrid . " Does it not seem odd that with all of the thrift and foresight we see here , that those who came in the beginning would not have built the dwellingplace nearer the spring and the lake ? " " You have a good mind , Sigrid , and what you say shows that you think . And that is good . But have you noticed how much more damp it is in the hollow where the water is ? And how much deeper the snow is in the winter , there ? " " Yes , Morfar , but  --  " " And we would n't have wanted our little Lissie to be without a wagon ride on washing day , would we , Lissie ? " " One word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , we will71leave the house and barn where they are , wo n't we , Peter ? " laughed Sigrid . " But , " said her grandfather , " I have been thinking , too . And there is one thing you must have . Now , while the weather is fine you must build an extension on to the shed , a covered way to the barn door , so in the winter snows you will have an inside passage . You will then not have to worry how deep the snow falls . " Many Swedish farms on the mainland have these sheds and you remember I showed you in the book about America , the picture of the dwellings in New England where house and barn have a connecting shed , making them as one . " Sigrid almost choked as she saw Peter look up questioningly at Morfar 's reference to the book . Morfar had noticed it too but , instead of showing embarrassment , his face took on a look of stem determination . She thought of her grandfather 's manner that day when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told her there was another gift for her in his sea chest , a gift of books which he hoped would enrich her life and bring many pleasant hours , but he had said , " The time is not right , as yet , to give them to you . One day soon , See'ri , one day soon  --  " " And in France  --  " went on Morfar . And he told of the French farms and the customs , and the men 's idling while the women worked , and of how he wished he could live to see the day when all women would be enfranchised . He became eloquent as he praised the work of woman  --  her natural sphere of creating and bringing forth , her service to her family and her home , her husband , her community and her country , and the lack of appreciationtendered her , which he deplored  --  her being relegated to the rank of servant in the minds of men , as evidenced by the attitudes of most men . " What voice does a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Man is the master , woman the slave . But mark my words , she will come in to her own . If only I could live to see the day ! " Sigrid sat motionless , afraid of what Peter might say , when her grandfather continued , " The day will come when woman no longer must submit to the animal in man at his will , when she can choose if and when she will confer her favors upon him . " 72Her eyes looked down at her breakfast plate . How much did he know ? Was it a thrust in the dark , or did he know ? Shame overcameher  --  shame that Morfar even should guess of Peter 's lust . Up into the wagon went the tubs of clothes . Up also the children , Sigrid , Peter , and Morfar . To the lake they hauled the clothes , to the widest deepest part of the creek , spilling from the spring . The water here was almost knee-deep , and clear as clear could be . Peter and Morfar began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying the tubs , but Sigrid noticed how soon the aged man tired , so she asked him to help her more by taking over the complete care of the children while she helped with the tubs . He removed his shoes and socks , did the same for Elisabet and they sat on the bank dipping their toes into the cool water , and wiggling their toes and feet to see which one could make most air bubbles with the motion . Karl slept . With her skirts caught up around her middle and her bare feet and legs in the water Sigrid stood at the bench , a crude thing made table height as the worker faced it and sloping down and away so the front legs were a good two feet shorter than the other two . She picked up one garment at a time , dipped it into the stream and with a smooth wooden batlet paddled it on top of the bench forcing the water out of the cloth with the batlet , dipped it and paddled it , again and again until the water which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clear and clean as that it rejoined in the stream . Every piece was rinsed in this same way , and when all were finished Sigrid swished clear water around in the tubs , emptied them , and replaced the clothing in the tubs for the wagon trip back to the houseyard . Morfar and Elisabet were loath to leave , but the promise of a spread luncheon table made them decide they would come back for more of this pleasure at another time . " The best part of washing day is now , " said Sigrid as she put the clothes to dry . Hung over the lower branches of a few trees , draped over every available inch of the stone fences of the house-73yard and the barnyard and spread out wide on the green grass , were her snow-white linens . " It is so satisfying , such pleasure to smell all of the nice clean clothes drying in the sun ! " Of course she must make fun for Elisabet . She braced long twigs and sticks together , forming the anatomical inwards for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twig , with arms straight out at the sides and legs walking with a giant stride ! Next came he with a pot belly and fat arms and short , bowed legs over which the legs of its unionsuit wrinkled and drooped . The parade of clumsy scarecrows was led by an Elisabet-sized dancer with one leg crossed in front of the other , a ballet dancer ready to twirl , with one arm crooked at the elbow holding a little basket of wild flowers . The afternoon sped . The clothes had dried now in the warm sunshine . Sigrid brought a large bucket of clean water , and by dipping her hand into the water and flirting her fingers over the linens , dampened them evenly . Down on her knees on the grass she worked , in the houseyard . She then folded the dampened clothes and laid them neatly , without a wrinkle , in large rectangular baskets , ready to take to the community mangle . What freedom she had known to do her work today ! Morfar had attended the children and relieved her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is happiness . " As Peter walked into the yard she called , " Oh , Peter , will you help me lift these baskets to the shed ? " " Leave them there . It would be foolish to carry them into the shed now and carry them out again in the morning . Use your head to save your  --  " " Of course , you are right , Peter . I will cover them over , " and to herself , " and hope the colt or the bull will not decide to go on a rampage tonight and decide to visit the houseyard , or the skies decide to give us a soaking spring rain . " Tired , pleasantly tired from the abundance of clean fresh air and sunshine , they all sought their beds early . Even Sigrid who knew she should knit or sew or weave , but who grew heavy-eyed and drowsy. 74The people seemed to Sigrid , as she raised her eyes for brief moments from her work at the mangle , to vie with each other in their attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words with him . What a picture he made , hat in hand and held over his heart while he conversed with the women . Nor did he sit when a girl or woman joined the group with which he talked . He stood , his tall frame stooped a little in his effort to meet their eyes on a level with his  --  his kindly , tender , good-humored blue eyes . " The respect he shows to others comes back to him a hundredfold , " thought Sigrid , as she caught a glimpse of him now and again as he mingled with the folk on the mainland where they had come to the community mangle . Peter she could not see . When it came his turn to relieve the relay of men at the roller-crank , the Widow Kvalvog 's son asked if he might have the honor and privilege of taking Peter 's place while she fed her linens to the rollers , Per Kvalvog , who as a child had sat near Sigrid in the schoolroom while his mother taught them . The teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoring eyes turned toward the golden-haired daughter of Norden ; rather had she spoken often to remind him of his lessons . Per Kvalvog who , approaching manhood , had longed to take the blossoming young woman in his arms as he had seen her face glow with thanks for the gift of Hardanger cloth brought by his mother from her native Norway . He with the long unruly dark hair brushed straight back from his forehead , with even big white teeth trying to hide in a large generous mouth  --  one which spoke so little , and seldom  --  he it was who asked to turn the rollercrank . Sigrid smiled her thanks and wondered at the look in his eyes . " I wish Peter would look at me in that way . Does Peter dislike me so much ? And if he does , how can he  --  " " Sigrid ! You had better watch your hands there . We do not want to pick one of those lovely hands out from under the roller . " He reached over and touched her arm and Sigrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a flush had started at her toe-tips and risen through her whole body until it reached her face . She could feel the redness as it crept into her75cheeks , and she lowered her eyes and became most energetic in her work on the linens . Where was a sheen as beautiful as came to these hand-woven linens from this cold mangle process ? Sigrid thought of moonlight on newfallen snow , and sunrise glistening on silvery hoarfrost , and candlelight shining on the pure white of her grandfather 's beard . Here he came , that beard parted in the center , each half grasped in the tight hold of one of Elisabet 's little hands . Walking bent over almost double , be swayed from side to side  --  the hanging child swaying with biro , like an elephant 's trunk  --  while the people , convulsed with laughter , followed or crowded round about them . The friendly clay was spent , a delightful and delicious outdoor meal being spread by the women after the mangling for all was done . And Peter joined the family group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the boat . Sigrid did not ask where he had been . She knew . As they sang , she and Morfar , to the time of the oars , an occasional " his " served as her husband 's contribution to the chorus . The fun of laying the linens away , she reserved for the next day . This day had been full , and by the time the children had been put to bed for the night and the animals attended to , Sigrid was ready to admit fatigue . Peter lay on the bunk bed , fully clothed . " Morfar , it is time you should go to bed . " " And you  --  ? " She could feel the telltale flush stealing over her features . She looked down at her hands in her lap . " I know you are tired , See'ri , and do not like even to admit it , but will you humor an old man and play me one game ? " He rose and went to the spare room for the chess board and men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , the heavy schackbriide between them , laid across their knees . Sigrid 's game was clumsy and bungling . Morfar raised his eyes and looked searchingly at his granddaughter . She could play a better game than thislAbsently she touched the pawn in front of her Queen and as she76moved it to the square ahead , the men on the board became to her the assembled peasantry at the mangling party . The tall , magnificent White King was her grandfather , and she saw again the admiration and respect and love all had for him . And she looked over at Peter , drunken on the bed " Checkl " Chagrined , she started , and looked closely at the board . The Black Queen , protected by the Black Bishop , had captured her King 's Bishop 's pawn , checking her King . " Oh , Morfar , a fool 's mate . I did n't see  --  " " Yes , it is a fool 's mate . Do you see what I mean , See'ri ? Do you understand now why I asked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think to protect your own position . " And as he gathered the chessmen , " Life , See'ri , is like a game of chess . And when you play , only you can keep your game from ending in a fool 's mate , only you  --  " 77Elisabet Selma Petersdotter Fodd den 10 Januari 1867Karl Mattias Petersson Fodd den 9 Februari 1868 Maria Elenora Petersdotter Fodd den 30 November 1868So read the page in Peter 's Bible now . Even hypercritical Peter could find no fault with Maria when she came . Her body was plump and well formed . One day met another until a Saturday came when Maria was five months old and Sigrid left her children in Morfar 's and Peter 's care , to take the place of a man on the fishing boats . Against the spoken wish of her grandfather she put on the heavy oilskins over long woolen underwear and old trousers , and went with the island men for the catch . Peter did not feel inclined to go . " Were there still not some sill in the salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day our daily bread ' ? " So Sigrid went . And the catch was good . But she came home tired , so tired that as she nursed the little Maria , her head fell forward on her breast , her arms relaxed and loosed their hold and the baby began to roll from her lap . Elisabet saw , came and stood78beside her mother and the baby , stood there and braced the child against the breast which fed it . Sigrid woke then , and seeing , realized what Elisabet had done . She kissed her warmly on the cheek and whispered , " I love you , Lissie , I love you . " She noticed then , as she had done many times before , that Elisabet stood so the fair side of her face was nearest her mother ; as when she climbed to Sigrid 's or Morfar 's lap , she made the attempt always to have the disfigured cheek turned away from the loved one . " She does not seem to be ashamed for herself . It is rather that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others , so the ones she loves shall not have to see . " Too , as she awoke , she saw her grandfather come from the spare bedroom with the unopened box he had saved from their gift-giving day , under his arm . " I think the time has come for me to give you the other gifts I brought for you  --  nearly a year ago  --  a little reward for your hard , hard work , " she heard him say . First he handed Elisabet a little book to carry to her mother . Proudly she toted it , dipping in a curtsy as she reached to place the book in Sigrid 's eager but trembling hand . It came near enough to Sigrid for her to read there on the lettered spine , " Fredrika Bremer  --  " Peter strode across the room , grabbed the book and tossed it into the fire . Time stoppedlBut not for the flames . They ate the cover , and as Sigrid watched page after page of the open book curl and become charred and shrivel into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could you ! How could you ! " Peter stood watching the flames , gloating , his face wreathed in a smile of the conqueror . Then his expression changed , and his features grew heavy and black . He turned and started to speak . But the thunder never broke  --  from him . Calmly , with restraint which was told in the throbbing veins at his temples , in the whiteness of the taut drawn flesh at the base of his nose , Sigrid 's grandfather stood facing Peter . The package79of books was clasped tight in his arms , held against his body . His eyes sprayed fire . " Peter ! You are no child . Yes . This is your home . But , also , it is Sigrid 's home . It was my home once , and I am thankful to be allowed to spend my last days here . Perhaps it is more than I deserve . But I am thankful . " Yes . It is Sigrid 's home ! It is her home by birthright . And she is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home and not just shelter from the winds " It is her home . " And here , except on the Sabbath  --  I grant you  --  she shall read what and when she desires . And her children shall read . And she shall read to her children . " And Peter , if this you can not abide  --  GO ! " The veins stood out blue on his temples . " Go , Peter , back to where you came from  --  NOW " Go  --  and DO NOT COME BACK . " For a moment Sigrid was afraid Peter would strike the old man . She shrank in loathing and breathed between clenched teeth . But Peter did not go . He walked back to his chair , haltingly , so that the tobacco pouch bounced against his chest as he took each step . Sigrid had tooled the hide and made that pouch which hung on a leather strap flung over the back of her husband 's neck . He opened the pouch , and filled his pipe . Her grandfather wiped the sweat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interruption , said , " Here , Lissie , is a book you will enjoy too , " and the child brought her Andersen 's Fairy Tales . Pride in his choice of books for his granddaughter grew as he watched her receive each book he sent to her , across the width of the fireplace , by the little blond messenger . Then came a SwedishEnglishdictionary , " because English will become the universal language and you and your children should at least know what the words look like . " " Sigrid felt her nervous tension break and although there were no tears , she sobbed as Elisabet fetched her Les Miserables . Terrible to see , this wrench toward freedom ; but no longer would she be compelled to sneak a book from hidden crevices . Terrible to remember , this first step toward freedom ; but she could80forget the ill . She would forget ; there was so much good came with it . Morfar had found the way so she could read to her children . Sigrid was glad she had taken her grandfather 's advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The winter had given proof of his wisdom . The snow had piled and drifted but they were not hindered in their work at the barn , and how wonderfulit had been to have the toilet facilities easy of access ! She threw the shutters open wide and the morning sun streamed in to finish her job of making this room in the barn , reserved for human convenience , fresh and sweet-smelling . She thought of how she and Morfar had worked to finish the building of the shed during last summer , and of the number of times she had begged Peter to help them and how , when they had despaired of being able to complete it before the winter set in , the sailors  --  Johann and his friend  --  had come and finished it in a twinkling . " Friends . What a treasure , friends . And books . But the more children I have , the less time I seem to have for them  --  and for reading , " she regretted . But she cheated herself of sleep rather than of reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that of preparing myself to be of help to my children . " Already she had begun reading to Karl . She smiled as she thought of the rare moments snatched out of her full days when she could sit with Karl on one knee and Elisabet on the other reading to them from Andersen 's Fairy Tales , which Morfar had brought , and which he seemed to enjoy as much as they . Elisabet would listen intently , but Karl most often slept . Since November , Sigrid had nursed both Karl and the new little Maria . But now Karl was learning to walk . True , mothers nursed their children until they were at least two years old , especially the boys to make them strong , but " it is high time I wean him from the breast . Two years to nurse is fine if there is only one to feed , but Maria is the one who needs it now , " she decided as she sprinkled fresh eneris needles thick over the clean-swept mud81floor of the toilet room . Pungent , like pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bushes in the woodlots . How happy she had been all during the winter to have her grandfather stay with her . It saddened her to know he had felt too frail to make his southern trip . He did not know that she had heard him tell the Pastor he was afraid to go , that the dizzy feeling which overcame him now and again brought home to him the knowledge he was growing very old . He had not wanted her to know , and his request to stay had been naively put , " Do you think you could stand it to have an old man around all winter , Sec'ri ? The south is not so pleasant as here . Here I can hug the fire , and maybe even be of some help to you with another baby coming . " Was it only that he felt physical senility overtaking him , robbinghim of his stamina ? Or was it that he knew how much happiershe was when he was there giving her pleasant companionship , and acting as a buffer against Peter 's ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big room , and as she entered the chest room , she thought of what a priceless helper he had been at the time of Maria 's birth ; and of how he had helped her also with the traditional bread-baking after the birth of a daughter . There on the chest room ceiling poles hung the goodly supply of knackebrod for daily use , the large thin flat round cakes of hard crisp bread made of a mixture of barley , oats , rye , and water . Made with an off-center hole in each , they were slipped over the poles to dry and to be used as needed . On the further pole first hung the disks reserved from the batch made after Elisabet 's birth , and next to them , the ones Morfar had helped her bake last winter when Maria came . These would stay there until the daughter'swedding day when she would break them into small pieces and serve them with ceremony to the guests . This room was not large . Neither was it small . Heavy beams ran the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should she not weave the picture of Norden as it stood today ? The homestead , the barns , the stone fences  --  it was the story of her life , Norden was . Not so rich a picture as those por-82traying selections from the Bible perhaps , but a homely picture . Yes , she would weave a picture of Norden to leave here on these walls to show that one day Fm Sigrid Kristiansson had been mistress of this place . Against the walls stood the chests . One was for bed linens , one for table and household linens , and one for woolens and coverlets , one for wall hangings and others for church clothes . There was the smaller , more elaborately decorated dower chest of Elisabet 's , and now the new one she had painted for Maria . " I wonder if Elisabet will ever know a home of her own , if any man would take her for his wife  --  would see how beautiful she is  --  all except for the mark . " The horses plodded slowly and evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight and true , with little trenches in the earth following in her path . Her rifle hung across her back , only a little burden while she plowed and of such worth when the crows came . She stopped to water the horses at the creek and as they drank , she drank in the beauty of the morning . Winter gone  --  was it spring  --  or had spring already turned to midsummer ? A quail called to its mate . A large mother goose strutted along the plowed rows , her fluffy goslings following close . From the barnyard came the faint sound of sows grunting contentedly and boars snoring as they lazed . The plowing done , sixty wooden teeth on the old , homemade harrow dragged over the newly turned soil , pulverized it and smoothed it , as Sigrid led the horses and Elisabet came to walk at her side , to help . " Now we will plant . You see how mama scatters the seed , and you do just as mama does . Then the sun and rain will make the seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a new linen tablecloth ! Here is your little girl-size basket . We will hang it on you  --  so . And I will put mine on me  --  so . " And she hung the straw baskets , each over one shoulder  --  the little one on Elisabet 's and the large one on her own  --  so the baskets hung in front , over their stomachs . " Now , with both hands , Lissie , dip into the basket , take two83handfuls and as we walk , cast it from you  --  as even as you can  --   --  so . The flax ( lust made breathing difficult , and the child grew tired after a row or two and sat down to rest while Sigrid strode up and down , scattering the flaxseed evenly over the field . She would be glad when this much of the planting was behind her . She loved the work in the fields but it was a robber of her time , the time she longed to spend with her children . She turned to come down the last row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Elisabet . " Herre Gud  --  " She wrenched the basket from her and tossed it as she ran . The large goose , taller than Elisabet , with her long neck arched , had the back of the child 's neck in her bill , holding Elisabet while her wide-spreading wings beat fast and hard against the little body . As Sigrid neared , the wings beat faster , and she saw that the child was near to insensibility . Not one instant did she hesitate . She reached for the rifle . " I know what it means if I miss  --  " She cocked the gun ; sighted " Faith . Faith is all I need . He told me Faith is all I need , " and shot . The child fell to the ground . The head of the goose raised straightening the long neck , its body spiraled and twisted , then in one heavy convulsion fell to lay beside the little girl . Sigrid picked Elisabet up in her arms and walked with her to the spring , stroking the hair back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthmark , begging her to open her eyes . She removed the child 's clothing and patted cold water on the bruised neck and body . Already black and blue had replaced the gentle pink of the tender skin . Lovingly , tenderly , she carried her child to the dwelling house and walked into the big room . " Quick , Morfar , two down pillows  --  laid end to end on the bed . " Sigrid placed her ear over the little heartbeat , and saw Elisabet smile as she spoke to her grandfather , " She will be all right , Morfar . " Faith has saved her precious life . " 84Part TwoX " MANY A GOOD DINNER have I eaten from your board , Fm Kristiansson , but this roast goose was the best dinner that has ever filled my cheeks . " The Reverend Oskarsstrom pushed his chair back , tilted it on its back legs and rocked slowly with his hands on his stomach , the fingers interlaced , and a smile of complete physical satisfaction wreathing his features . Sigrid had eaten only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could not bring herself to eat goose meat since that day almost four years before when she had cooked the goose which had attacked Elisabet . The very sight of a goose weakened her , and it was all she could do to prepare and roast one for a meal . Eating was something to be enjoyed . Never again would she enjoy a feast which brought back so vividly the suffering of the little child who had wanted only to admire newly hatched goslings . The roughly scarred skin on the back of Elisabet 's neck was reminder enough . Why did she ever have to see another such fowl ? 85It was Peter 's favorite dish , and he had spoken . There was to be goose dinner for the Pastor and his wife , the Pastor whom Peter had invited to visit Norden today to talk to his wife about her neglect of reading God 's Book . Sigrid wondered if he would tell the Reverend Oskarsstrom of last Wednesday when she had sat with Elisabet and Karl , reading to them from the book of fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness far beyond her nearly six years of age , asked for this story time and again . Did she draw a comparisonto her own self ? Sigrid noticed always as she finished the story  --  as the ugly duckling remembered how unhappy he had been , persecuted and despised , and now that he was the most beautiful of all birds , how he had never dreamed of so much happiness while he was still the ugly duckling  --  that Elisabet sat dreamy-eyed , looking into space , not aware of what went on about her . And Sigrid hoped she had not heard , or did not remember , her father 's many pronouncements that it would have been better to have let the ugly child die than to have nursed her through the long fever which followed the infected bite on her neck . Sigrid hoped , yes , but she knew the sensitive child heard and understood and cringed when Peter 's rudenesses to her ended with his saying that he might as well not let her " get ideas she is like other people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his contempt for her expressed in the screwing up of one side of his nose , his mouth following the pattern , making the sneer completeand unmistakable . " You do not find time to read the Bible , Sigrid . " She had looked up at him , and in looking her eyes had caught a glimpse of Morfar , asleep in his chair . She knew Peter was taking advantage of not being heard . Her grandfather could so easily , in his quiet way , turn a conversation so Peter 's words of criticism or complaint lost their effectiveness and in turn were lost in general verbal intercourse . " I love to read to the children , Peter , and they love to listen . The fairy tales bring stories down to little children . " " Such stories ! " he had said . " But , Peter , Andersen 's Fairy Tales are  --  " 86 " Andersen ! What is he but a crazy man ? Hans Christian Andersen , indeed  --  as crazy as any man in history . Gottfrid Larsson of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been to Germany , and when he came home again to Denmark he ran to the tree standing in his houseyard and threw his arms around it , and cried , and spoke to it as though it was a man ! " He had reached for the book , but she had closed it , folded it under her arm close to her left breast . She had felt her heart pounding against it as she reminded her husband that she was retaining the privilege of reading , that she would devote any time on the Sabbath to reading the Bible but would leave the daily study of it to him . And the Pastor 's visit was the consequence of her defiance . The atmosphere all round about the room seemed heavy until Fru Oskarsstrom , smiling , asked Sigrid the secret of the richness of the foliage and blooms on her window sills . " You are blessed , my dear Sigrid , with fingers called green . That can I see . Will you start a fuchsia slip for me ? " Sigrid spoke , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearness of God  --  in such as this . When a little fuchsia slip one day rewards your watching and sends a leaf to show at the base of one of the eyes , next to the stem  --  when the sun pulls a little pale green spear through the black earth and we know the seed we have planted is beginning to grow  --  when a new baby sends the first fluttering motion through the body of its mother  --  when a child comes into the world and utters its first cry  --  " The Pastor looked up and their eyes were locked in a gaze of perfect understanding , as though each was naked before the other , baring their souls. "  --  when the sun rises and gives warmth  --  and it sets , making the sea aflame  --  when the thin crescent moon sets later into the same sea , drawing a fine line of flickering silver to meet the shore  --  and I stand listening to the sea playing its symphony , one wave a violin , one wave a viola , one a harp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other , pleading with each to understand her , as she finished , " That is the way I hold , best , my communion with God . " The Reverend Oskarsstrom looked directly at Peter , " Husfru87Sigrid is a lesson to us all . To my mind , she has learned the true meaning of God 's omnipotence . " The cloak of tension dropped from Sigrid 's shoulders and she smiled warmly at Morfar as she served him first , a dish of PappilanHktavara  --  the rich dessert she had made of lingonberry preserve added to heavy whipped cream  --  and its accompanying skorpa soaked in the berry juice . Little Johann Gustave , barely three weeks old , needed no Hatavara . He lay sleeping in the hanging cradle , swung by long leather straps from a hook in the ceiling so as to be at the elbow of his mother while she ate . A fine family sat at this board . Now there were two boys and two girls . A good rest Sigrid had had after Maria 's birth ; Maria was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Johann came along . Johann , named for the good friend Johann Sandell , the sailor who appeared always when most needed . The sailor who loved the aged Morfar almost as much , Sigrid thought , as she did . Elisabet rose first from the table . With a curtsy and a low tack for maten , she reached little arms to clear the board and carry dishes to the summer kitchen . The Pastor 's wife followed quickly and , with a smile and affectionate embrace , she turned the child from the direction of the dinner table and said , " My dear little girl , go and play with brother Karl , or play on your harmonica or with your ekorre . I am going to help mama wash the dishes . " " I , Peter Kristiansson , do not allow the Pastor 's wife to serve in the kitchen . Come  --  " " Pastor 's wife or farmer 's wife , we are women together and have much in common . We will talk while we work . " Coolly she turned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do all that you do , and still find time to teach your little ones fine manners ? " They talked of housekeeping , and the Pastor 's wife , whose most practical accomplishment had been the completing of a sampler to prove she had at least become acquainted with the gentle art of stitchery , listened as Sigrid told her of the shawl she was making for her son . She told of how she called the sheep to her and whispered caresses into their ears while she wielded the clipping shears . And88how as she clipped the tight , dense , crimpy fleece she carefully sorted and laid to one side the longest fibres selected from the choicest parts of each animal , how she washed it in soap suds to remove the dirty smelling body oils and perspiration and dirt and sticks and burrs , and then rinsed it and laid it out on clean linen sheets to dry in the sun . The Pastor 's wife listened as to a story , as Sigrid told how she had carded the wool ; and watched as her hostess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , each with a handle . Sigrid held one in the hollow of her left hand , the nailpointsupward , while with the other in her right hand she combed and carded a bit of wool to show her friend how she had done . Her eyes glistened , her face flushed with the memory of the pleasure she had known , as she spoke of carding it finer than any wool she had ever worked with before . And when she had spooled the web-like fluff onto slender cylinders , she knew it would be the finest wool a shawl had ever known . Ebba Oskarsstrom almost could see the dye vat as Sigrid relivedthe preparation of the color  --  " the blue of the sea when it is peaceful , the blue of the sky in an October twilight just as the first large star pierces the heavenly curtain , the blue of truth and honor , the blue of Karl 's eyes . " And as Fru Oskarsstrom held the work in her hands , and marvelledat the tiny stitches and the pattern of it , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knitting needles  --  needles of sewing-needle thinness  --  and praised Sigrid , " You are an artist , my dear , an artist with a soul . The color , even though you try to tell me , is beyond description  --  and see  --  almost a yard wide and yet I can crush it into the palm of my hand . " Like a spider 's web , you said . " Yes , it is fine , like a spider 's web . " They re-entered the large room to hear Morfar telling the Pastor of Karl 's love for Hjarta , his horse . Overlarge for his almost five years , the boy sat on one knee and Maria on the other , with Elisabet at Morfar 's feet watching him as he talked , intent on listening so no syllable should escape their eager ears . " Before he could stand , she put him on the colt 's back . And he89seemed to fit there , as she knew he would . He was at home sitting there astride , clinging with baby hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly round the barn . And the colt seemed to sense that Karl was his master . They loved one another from the first time Sigrid brought the boy to him . " He sat for a minute , musing , and stroking his beard , " And scarcely a day has passed since that Karl has not been set or set himself on Hjarta 's back . " Rising as the women entered , a child under each arm , he seated himself again only after the Pastor 's wife and his granddaughter drew chairs and joined the group to listen . " The horse has grown faster than the boy . But little Karl fits him well . And the love they have for each other has grown to keep apace with both of them . It is beautiful to see . And Karl has learned to feed his own horse , and does it all by himself , and does it well . " " Let us see how you can ride , " suggested Fru Oskarsstrom . The Pastor set his broad-brimmed black hat carefully over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine to the barnyard . A little piping voice called , " Oh , come , Min Hjarta  --  " and the horse came flying from the field and stopped at Karl 's side . Quick as a flash Karl 's toes touched one stone , then a higher one in the fence , and swinging himself by holding on to the horse 's mane , soon he sat easily , bareback , clinging to the mane , his legs scarcely reaching beyond the animal 's back to press against its sides . And as Hjarta walked , the body of the boy rose and dipped and it seemed to the watchers they were one  --  either the boy was a part of the horse , or the horse a part of the boy . Over the low fence they went , beyond the fence outlining the cow pasture , on toward the sheep . " Are you not afraid to let the boy go so far alone ? After all , he is nothing more than a baby  --  " " Pastor Oskarsstrom , of what should I be afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own land  --  should I not fear myself , or my selfishness  --  and nothing else ? God forbid I should ever try to hold my children close to my skirts , fooling myself into believ. ing it is because I would shelter them from the harm of the world. 90Cannot a mother lie on her new-born babe and smother the life from it , meaning to protect it , yes , but wishing more to keep it near to her ? " " You are a wise young woman , " and the Pastor looked at her in wonder . The woodbine on the fences was still , blazing a red glory against the gray of the irregular , smooth stones . Soon winter would come again . Even as they stood , a pattern of wild geese cut the sky and faintly they heard a chattering , warning them to fill the sheds with " bok " wood and see to their warm clothing and ski . " And it seems the wild birds tell me to let the children and the animals enjoy the warm weather while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sigrid dreamily as she watched the " V " disappear in the southern sky . " We must go home now , my wife . It has been a beautiful day , a fine visit . Thank you , Sigrid  --  thank you Captain Karl  --  thank you . " As the Pastor and his wife went indoors to bid adieu to Peter , Sigrid and her daughters went to the kitchen and packed one little basket with seeds of her favorite blue-purple columbine , parsley to dry and use during the winter , a bouquet of heather , and a bottle of her " medicine " for Fru Oskarsstrom 's house plants  --  the medicine she made by letting water stand on old barnyard manure , well-rotted and mellow , and then drained off . They packed another , larger basket with berry jelly and smoked mackerel , cheese , and the remains and carcass of the goose . " Let us cover it with these pretty new dish towels . She liked them , Lissie , and we can always make more . " " You are good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled as she said , " Now you take the baskets and give them to the Pastor , for his wife . You , the large one , Lissie ; and Maria , you take the little one . " Thanks and smiles and adieusWaving from the boat landing as the spiritual shepherd left his well-loved followers , the young mother , her two daughters , and the aged Captain stood braced against the sea wind . " We are fortunate to have as Pastor , such a man , " said Morfar. 91 " We are indeed , " answered his granddaughter , as they walked slowly back to the dwelling . After milking and other evening duties were done for the day , Sigrid finished nursing Johann , and as she watched the older sister help Maria undress and fold and hang her clothing neatly for the night , Sigrid whispered to Morfar , " Karl is long away . I will go out and see if he has brought the horse to the barn . " Hjarta was not in the barn . Nor in the barnyard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes roving over the fields . Through the pasture she walked , beyond the sheep , on through the woodlot , beyond the firs , through the birch swamp , to the peat bog . Little curls of smoky vapor rose from the bog , but there was no boy  --  no horseSigrid walked back , circling around the edge of the woodlot , toward the boat landing , and back to the barnyard . There was Karl , rubbing the lower legs of his beloved horse , rubbing as far up as his arms could reach while the horse ate , and turned , lowered his head and rubbed it against the face of the boy . " Did you have a good ride , Karl ? " " Oh , yes  --  mama  --  yes . " He patted the horse , and as Sigrid walked toward the house Karl walked with her , his short arms around her skirts restricting her leg motion and accentuating the outline of her form . And as they walked , he told her of his ride and how he and Hjarta had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and played with them , peering at each other from behind trees and hiding behind the hanging mosses and in the berry bushes . " When I get big , mama , do you know what I am going to do ? " " What are you going to do , Karl , when you get big ? " " Mama  --  I am going to write a fairy story  --  about Hjarta andthe Trolls and me . " They passed by Peter . His raised hand fell to his side . What deterred him ? Karl had lingered out of doors beyond his bedtime . Here was his opportunity to chastise the boy and , in the doing , belittle the mother . He looked at his wife . There was that about her face which92reminded him of a vision . Was there a light about her head or was his sight deceiving him ? As though afraid , he let them pass . Sigrid had not seen him , with the buggy whip in his hand , waiting . She saw beyond  --  far beyondShe saw Victor Hugo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dreams coming true . Her heart sang. 93XI " MANY BANDS make light work . " Sigrid cheerfully encouraged the little semi-circle of cobblers seated before the flickering fire . " See , children , here is the perfect shoe sole , carved as only your father can carve a sole , so the arch is smooth and the heel begins at just the right place . And look at the top of it ! As smooth as a stone that has been polished for years by ocean waves , " and she held the wooden sole up on the tips of her thumb and two forefingers , balancing it before them as she praised her husband 's work . So little work Peter had to show for the more than three years since that Sunday of the Pastor 's visit , soon after baby Johann had come . She would be thankful , though , that Peter cut a fine sole . He sat next to the fireplace . As he whittled to shape the piece of wood into a sole , the chips fell onto the bricks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those chips are adventurous and want to see the world , " Sigrid said and that was why they shot up into the air , or over to the near wall , bouncing back or falling slowly to the floor. 94One section of the room she pointed out , was England , one was France , one was Germany , one Finland , and one Denmark . She played a game with the children to learn how much they had retained of what she and Morfar had taught them . When a little adventuresome chip landed in " France , " the child whose turn it was , told of the country and the customs . He told of the dress , named the principal cities and rivers and mountains , the industries and the exports , and spoke the few French words he knew . They did the same for each country in turn , wherever a sliver of wood might fall . There must have been a knot in the wood , or Peter put extra pressure back of his knife , and one large chip flew half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , she asked , " Oh , mama , this went farther than all of Europe . Where did this one go ? " " It went to America , the land where every little chip would like to go , but where only big chips can find their way . " Then there was great talk about the new world . " I would have liked to see America , See'ri . No matter how old a man gets , he never has had time enough in his life 's span to do all of the things he would have liked to do . " The old sea Captain told them as they sat working , of the stories that sailors from the faraway continent had repeated , of the opportunities the new land offered to high born and low , alike . " I would have liked to see America , yes . But Sweden has given me a good life to remember , a full life . I have been happy here , and blessed . " As Sigrid cut the hides into shapes to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her grandfather , passed it through the hands of each of the children  --  asking each to rub the leather between his hands to keep it soft , or to smooth an edge here , or make sure it had no roughness there  --  so every one should feel he 'd had a share in the making . The years had hurried by . No longer was little Johann a baby . He stood now at Morfar 's elbow and held the tacks in cupped palms , scarcely daring to breathe for fear he would move his hands and let one tack fall to the floor . Morfar stretched the leather to fit the sole , tacked it at the rear95to hold it together , and at the center front . Sigrid tried hard to keep from noticing how the palsy shook his hands so he barely could hold a tack long enough in place to give it a hammer tap . Then the shoe began its return trip to the mother , Johann followingto provide the tacks , and she with deft fingers nailed the leather to the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole . Stitches of fine strips of cowhide closed the leather at the back , and then the shoe was ready to fit onto a foot , to slide a foot into and pull up onto a heel by the little point of leather which extended gracefully upward and followed the line of the back of the ankle . Sigrid saw Karl looking intently at the shoe Elisabet was trying on , and then he asked , " America . How far is America ? " " Far enough so you will never see it , " answered his father as he laid his work aside and lighted his pipe . Sigrid cut the inner soles from woolen material she had felted . Glued to the inside , the placing of the inner sole finished the shoe , and the lucky owner danced a polka or a schottische while the hands of the others clapped in two-four time . " You dance well , Elisabet . Do you notice , Peter , how her body is graceful and lithe , like her mother 's ? " " Herre Karl , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies are alike , " and Peter sucked in the saliva which had accumulated where his pipe rested between his lips . Sigrid rose and grasping Elisabet around the waist , she danced with her . They drifted from the two-four time to three-quarter and she sang as they waltzed , and Morfar joined in the singing . They finished the waltz . The old man looked wistfully at his granddaughter . She knew he was young again and read his thoughts through his eyes which had not left hers . As their song ended , no one spoke . None wished to be the one to break the thread of memory 's enchantment . They sat looking into the fire and Sigrid saw herself as a child , sitting on the floor beside her mother 's wheelchair , as her grandfatherread to them . As he read his hand would stroke the long golden hair tumbling back from the pale ethereal face to the floor , and carpeting the floor for the length of an arm. 96Her mother never had walked after her confinement . The milk leg never healed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elias . All but from her hair . The wreath of hair flowers under glass , hanging on the wall between the deep-set windows , gave testimony still as to the length and coloring ; but they remembered well , this man and Sigrid . Only Peter 's deep even breathing , punctuated by a whistling puff with each exhalation , broke the stillness . Sigrid looked at her family . Morfar looked steadily into the fire . Elisabet had picked up her knitting . Karl slowly tiptoed from the room . Sigrid knew he wanted to share this tranquil moment with Hjarta . And threeyear-oldJohann slept , his fat legs spread wide apart and his body folded over so his forehead touched the floor between his legs . They grew fast , these children . But there was always another baby . Now Herman Nikodemus lay in the cradle . Three weeks old , a fine boy . Sigrid marvelled that he could be so fine . " Conceived as they are , I wonder they are not all deformed . If it were in love  --  what then would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on little Herman 's lower lip , the nursing blister , then moved through the aching dusk silently to her flax wheel , and sat on the linset . Well would she remember the past year , eighteen hundred and seventy-five . True , she had never seen him , but he had been her friend , Hans Christian Andersen . Death had claimed him in that year and , as though to compensate , Christmas Day had brought Herman Nikodemus . Born on the birthday of Jesus , would he be more Christ-like than the rest ? She grasped one of the little turned handles between the spokes and started the wheel , drew a sliver from the big fibrous mass on the spindle , and drew thin uneven fibres between her finger tips , drawing it out , spitting on her fingers , drawing it again to even it , twisting as she drew and occasionally stopping to pick out and throw away bits of brown straw . She stopped the wheel and greeted Karl when he came into the room , " Did you ride , Karl ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is so much to talk about , and Hjarta understands . You believe he understands me , do n't you , mama ? " and the child glanced furtively in the direction of his father . " Yes , Karl , I know he understands . He understood me , even before you were born , telling about you . He is a fine horse , and you are a fine boy , Karl . And the little stories you write about him will one day bring back these happy days to you . You will be a man , and have a son of your own on your knee , and you will read to him of Hjarta 's love and yours , the stories you and I have put on paper . Let us read some of them now . " Arms around each other , they went to the fireplace and removed the loose bricks . " Our Niche for Literature , " they called it now , not " My Niche  --  " Sigrid brought out her treasures , too dear to stow in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored her eager audience , and she read . First , of course , must come " The Ugly Duckling " from the Fairy Tales , and for Maria , " Thumbelina . " Karl must hear " Great Klaus and Little Klaus , " and Johann wanted " Little Tuk , " but fell asleep again even before Little Tuk 's mother came home in the second paragraph . Sigrid laid the book aside and picked up little paper sheets covered with writing , some in her hand , some in the even perfect script of the sea Captain , and some in the scrawly printed and written letters of the boy who was almost eight years old . She read what the boy had written , and finished with , " ' My Hjarta means my heart . Without my heart , I could not live : " She gathered her treasures . " Beautiful , Karl . Your stories are beautiful , " and she piled them neatly as her grandfather watched . She topped the pile with an old , yellowed , folded piece of parchment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it unfolded she saw her grandfather start . He opened his eyes wide , as he grasped the arms of his chair and tried to rise . Was he ill ? Sigrid flung the books and papers on her chair seat and went to him . " What is it , Morfar ? " 98He had calmed . " Show me that parchment , See'ri . Show me . Where did you find it ? " " It is nothing , Morfar . I have always had it  --  almost always . Ever since I first took those two bricks out of the fireplace wall . It was in there , in the big hole back of the bricks , and I kept it as a secret treasure . It was such a pretty old color , Morfar . And the lines on it , I played , were secret messages to me . Did I do wrong , Morfar ? I wanted to have a treasure . And this was my treasure . " " Yes , your treasure . You do not know what a treasure you have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet well do I know what that parchment means . " The group stood gaping as he went on , " You may find it hard to believe , but my own Sigrid , your great-grandmother , " he addressed the children , " was once a little child  --  And her greatgrandfather , even as I with you , sat with her before this very hearth and told her stories of long ago . They had no book of fairy tales , but he told her tales of the sea , and of her forebears . And she told me . " The old Captain 's shaking hands brushed his eyes , as a sleepy child might do . His head nodded " yes , yes , " as he said , " This is the story she was most often told . A true story , her great-grandfather told her  --  " He had a faraway look in his sea-blue eyes . And then he told them , " Once on a time there was a beautiful Queen . This Queen and her King ruled the great northern country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved Queen was to bear an heir to the throne . " A ship soon would come laden with gifts for the Queen . Fitting gifts for her would be the jewels  --  emeralds and rubies  --  and the silks and spices from India and the Orient , and the ports on the seven seas . " A son was born to the beautiful Queen , but the ship never came . The King offered large ransom to whosoever could deliver the men of the crew , or send some small word to lead to their return . " But the ship never came ! " The aged man reached for the parchment and held it in his shaking hand. 99 " Now , on an island off the coast of Scandinavia , there lived a family whose men were pirates bold . In their own way , they had learned of the ship which was to bring treasure to the Queen . They built false fires on their island  --  fires the sailors on the ship believed were to guide them to the mainland port  --  and these fires spelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As surely as though the Lorelei haunted the little harbor of the island , the ship was drawn to the fires , and the pirate men disposedof the crew and plundered the ship . " What became of the ship ? Nobody knows . Maybe that threeleggedstool there came from the Captain 's quarters . " What became of the rubies and emeralds and other precious stones ? Nobody knows . " But this we know . " On that ship  --  a gift planned for the beautiful Queen , for her baby  --  was a cradle of solid gold . And the pirate men buried that cradle on their farm so the King 's men , when they came on their tours of inspection of the farms , would not see it and thereby know they were the interceptors of the treasure ship . " And the pirate men drew a map to show where they had buried the cradle , and how deep  --  " The parchment shook , and the silence around it was so deep the sound was like a roaring wave breaking against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pirates lived , was Norden . " " Eyes met eyes , and eyes moved from one set to another . Breaths came pantingly , quickly , as he continued , " Some day , ' her great-grandfather told my Sigrid , some day , someone will find that map . And the golden cradle will find its place in the sun . " He stopped to wipe the perspiration from his forehead , and the tears from his eyes . " Your treasure , indeed . See'ri , this is that map . I know . We will follow the lines on this map as soon as the winter is over and we can dig in the ground , we will find the cradle , and send it to the King . " As Sigrid heard her husband laugh she moved between him and100her old Morfar , breaking the waves of sound , brushing the white hair back from the damp forehead . " It will be fun , Morfar . Just like a fairy story it will be . Just like finding the gold at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me . We will dig up the golden cradle . " " Dear God  --  let me live until the spring  --  " she heard him pray. 101XIIEAGER DAYS THESE , waiting for the coming of spring . Day after day Morfar sat with the children  --  the two smallest on his lap , Maria standing between his knees , Karl standing on one side with his arm around the old man 's neck , and Elisabet on the other side with an arm also around his neck and resting over the arm of her brother  --  telling again the story of the map . Eyes shining , mouths partly open , faces flushed , they drank in his words . No word ever to be forgotten , each word to grow in wonder as they remembered these ecstatic hours in the future . " Will you let me help to dig ? " " I will feed the horses , mama . You have so much to do . " " I am big enough to wash the milk cans , mama . " " Will you let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smiled when the children insisted Sigrid leave the kitchen chores to them in the evenings so she could spend time making small shovels to fit the hands , and height , of Maria and Johann . All was to be in readiness when the spring broke and the ground thawed . With Karl pumping the bellows Sigrid smithed102two small shovel blades , and she made their handles while sitting by the fireside . Neat little shovels . They studied the map on the parchment , and when the deep snow melted , paced the ground , wishing their legs were long enough to stretch a full metre so they could know exactly where was the spot the first shovelful of earth would be lifted . " Who will dig the first shovelful , mama ? " " When we find the cradle , and Morfar writes to the King , will the KING come HERE and get the cradle , mama ? " It was as though the air were filled with lightning , one flash no sooner spent than another followed in close succession , or breathing was suspended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded around Captain Ivarsson as be sat at the end of each day , pen in hand , composing the letter he would send to his King . Much precious paper was wasted as he wrote words , was dissatisfied with them , scratched lines through them , and wrote again . No longer was the map necessary . Even the smallest of them knew it now by rote  --  the huge irregular rock in the stone fence , drawn and marked as the starting place " How strange , " wondered Sigrid , " that I never thought to comparethe shape of the only big stone in all the fences , with the picture on the parchment . A perfect drawing of the stone it is , large and flat at the base , and shaped like a house with a hip roof . " Two metres and three centimetres , south by west from the most northeast corner of the stone . So it was drawn . Following in a straight line was the length of the oblong , the width extending south and east . " The oblong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was not the merest shadow of a doubt among his young listeners . " That brings the buried treasure almost in the center of the east barnyard , " he said , " almost directly east of the barn doors . " Two metres deep . " Deeper than the height of a man . We will need a ladder as the hole gets deep  --  " Sigrid and her sailor grandfather constructed a rope ladder , the103kind he 'd had aboard his ship skirting the halyards up the masts , the rungs just wide enough for a foot to rest on and the rope twisted around the hole near each end of the rung , securely , so no rung could slip but would hold secure under the weight of any man . Then came the spring . The little glass tube for which they all knew they owed a deep debt of gratitude to Anders Celcius , the Celcius thermometer , stood daily now at zero degrees or slightly above . The snow had gone , and the ground gave to the testing shovel . Now the search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yielded its compass , metre tape , rod , and square . Each day for many days Karl Ivarssonand his great-grandchildren had started at the northeast corner of the big stone , to measure . And when they were reassured by repeated provings , that their measurements were true to the drawing on the parchment , they drove sticks into the ground and connected the sticks with hemp cord . There , outlined in hemp , was the oblong marking the resting place of the cradle . Around this oblong they danced and sang . All of the family must be present , Elisabet with Kiki in his cage on the ground near her , Karl and Hjarta , Maria and her little pet lamb , and Johann and Lucifer-his tamed sea gull  --  the gull which had come with a broken wing . Johann had begged Sigrid to clip off the hanging , bleeding , broken part . And after the wing had healed , Lucifer stayed close to the boy , not answering the call of his brothers who flew above nor exhibiting any desire to trade his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known . They joined hands , all but Peter , and sang as they ringed around the oblong . The pets did not quite understand , but knew they were present at some great ceremony and behaved their best . A great ceremony . " Morfar , here , break the ground ! " He lifted the first shovelful of earth , neatly , just inside the hemp-marked corner of the oblong . He and Sigrid evenly scored the earth to mark the outline . Then the digging began in earnest . All the time that could be spared was spent in digging . Pitifully little was accomplished on that first day. 104 " Tomorrow the hole will be deeper , " Sigrid assured the tired workers . On the second and third days they joked about how they had pleaded to be allowed to join in the digging . Now , if the treasure did not mean more to them than aching arms and backs and blistered hands , they might have pleaded to be allowed not to join . Day after day they dug into the hard ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole in sacks slung over their backs , climbing up the little ladder which had been stapled firmly by their mother to the ground at the top . Two metres deep . " Morfar , do not look so discouraged . Yes , we are two metres deep , but you know how things settle down during the years . And think of all the years the cradle has had to settle . No . We will not give up . Tomorrow we will dig deeper . " She helped the aged Captain fit his foot to the lower rung of the rope ladder and held her hand at his back as he negotiated the first few rungs , then steadied his ankles and soon he reached the ground level and raised his body over the edge of the deep hole . It was a large hole . Sigrid looked down as she reached the top . But there was no cradle . " Poor Morfar , I wish we could have found it . He was so sure . The taunts Peter will thrust at us  --  and Morfar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor , poor Morfar . " Morning came , but they were not refreshed . Discouragement added fatigue to tired bodies . Peter came to look . Trying hard to conceal her utter disgust , Sigrid appraised his tall frame , compared it to her aged Morfar 's and the children 's , and asked , " Will you help us dig for a little while , Peter ? It is hard to dig down so deep  --  " " Help you dig ? Ha ! You listen to the foolish notions and the childish prattle of an old man who has already lived too long  --  and I should help you dig ? " Peter spat , with the wind . " You can dig . Go on . Dig . You !  --  who the Pastor says has good sense . You who teach lies to your children  --  lies about good fairies105and Trolls , and a Tomte gubbe at Yuletide  --  and buried treasure  --  look at you ! What would the Reverend Oskarsstrom say if he could see you now ? " " He would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimicking the voice of their Pastor , " ' Here , Fru Kristiansson , let me have your shovel for a space , while you rest  --  " ' Peter raised his large hand and struck her a blow on the side of her head so she reeled , spun half way round , lost her footing , and fell into the deep hole they had been , for all those days , digginglower and lower into the ground . " God forgive me . I hate him , " muttered Sigrid through clenched teeth . A panorama of many days and events flashed before her eyes in the fragment of time until she and Karl were descending the rungs of the homemade rope ladder . Sigrid saw the eagerness with which her grandfather had awaited the coming of this spring . She saw his eyes shining with faith in his wife , Sigrid , and her story . She was the first to reach Elisabet , and Karl followed as soon as she left the bottom rung of the ladder . The child sat stunned , eyes straight ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lissie , speak to me . Speak to me , where are you hurt ? " " Tell mama  --  tell mama , " begged Karl . With three of them at the bottom of the hole , they were very close to each other . Sigrid moved to place herself directly in front of the girl 's eyes , but as she did so Elisabet moved and winced , but her eyes were fixed . " Lissie , dear Lissie , tell mama . Where does it hurt ? " Tears broke then and Elisabet threw herself on her mother 's breast and cried , and sobbed . Sigrid looked up to see Morfar 's anxious face peering down at them , and Maria 's , and Johann 's , and Hjarta 's . " I am sorry for what papa has done , Lissie . I am sorry . Is there anything I can do to show you how sorry I am ? " " Mama , forgive me , oh , mama  --  I hate him . I will try never to go near to him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forgive me . " Sobs shook the child 's frame. 106Then peace moved in , and quietly she said , " But , mama , do you remember , you have told us when ill comes  --  we should forget the ill ?  --  that always good will come after ? And the good will be greater than the ill ? Do you remember , mama ? " " Yes , yes , I remember . " " When I fell , I hurt myself here , " and she touched her lower back . " I hit the side wall of our oblong  --  there  --  do you see , mama ?  --  there  --  " and her eyes stared again . " Yes . But your back , Lissie  --  " " It is not bad-hurt , mama . But look  --  where I hit against the side , the dirt brushed down  --  and  --  mama , do n't you see what I see ? " Afraid to look , afraid to feel the child 's forehead , afraid of delirium , slowly she turned and followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . Part , only a small part of what looked to be a circle of metal tubing of small diameter , was there . And where Elisabet 's clothing had brushed the dirt aside , the metal had the color of gold ! " Elisabet , oh , Elisabet , my darling ! Only you could have been the angel from Heaven who could find the answer to our Morfar 's prayer . " She clawed the earth away with her bare hands , all the while crying , " Morfar , Morfar  --  I think Lissie has found it  --  " She clawed enough to find the end of the narrow tubing of metal , and was sure . Karl and his mother climbed the rope ladder and helped the old Captain over the side so he could share in the triumph of the explorer  --  the discoverer . And they looked down at him and Elisabet , arms around each other , happiness filling the excavation  --  happiness filling them all . So they must start again to dig . They had miscalculated , and the far edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But no difference . What matter now that hands were blistered , backs were sore ? What matter that a fingernail fell with the dirt as Sigrid had clawed at the wall in that first exuberant moment ? They had found the treasure . Carefully they set their shovels . Carefully they removed the earth close to the cradle . It was not hard work now , because as107they dug they could throw the earth into the hole already made . Peter came and helped them lift it out of the ground . " It should bring a nice price , if it is really gold , " he said . There it was , flat runners at the base extending into standards front and back . Swung between the two standards , the basket cradle swayed , and from the head rose an arched slim tubing shaped to lend a graceful air to the drapery which should fall softly from the arch to protect a baby 's head from cold or draughts . At the end of the arch , a hook-shaped turn was there to keep the drapery from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . The runners were wide so there would be no tipping , and a good brace ran lengthwise between them for the foot of the one who rocked the cradle to rest upon . But the basket . It was strong , but oh , so dainty . Of a filigree pattern of small vines and flowers and baby angels , the angels ' wings veined in spun golden metal threads . As Sigrid polished , her Morfar sat and gazed  --  a faraway gaze  --  yet his eyes were glued to the cradle . As though his head had become too heavy  --  he sat holding it up , cupped in his hands , and saying softly , " My Sigrid told me true " My Sigrid told me true  --  " 108XIIIHis Majesty , Oskar II , King of Sweden , The Royal Palace , Stockholm , Sweden . Your Royal Majesty , My Beloved King : I am an old man , presuming much in writing to Your Majesty . Two and ninety years have I been a loyal and loving subject of our land and its King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the dream of an old man , " but I pray you  --  read onand he told of his wife and the story of her people that she had told him , how the story had lain dormant for these many years because of the pain in the telling . He told of the map , and his granddaughter , and the finding of the cradle . Your Majesty , the cradle is here , waiting for you to claim it so it may reside forevermore in its rightful home . God Bless You and Keep You in His Holy Ways , Your humble and respectful servant , KARL IVARSSON OF NORDF.N109After Sigrid had posted the letter on the mainland , the old Captain thought of how much better he could have written if he had not been in such a hurry to send it away . They waited impatiently for word in reply . " Will the King come , Morfar ? " " Will the King come , mama ? " No , the King himself would not come . " But why , mama  --  ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the family and , though the waiting was impatient , secretly each was glad for every day the treasure was allowed to live at Norden . Yes , it was more than a cradle . It was an unbreakable thread linking them to the past , a monument to their belief in Captain Ivarsson , a symbol of the faith he had in his wife , a tribute to their constancy and perseverance , and above all , an opportunity to prove the family honor by cleansing their souls and hands of pirate greed . " Am I not master here ? " Peter had said . " A pretty penny should we get for this on the English market . Are you so dull you are satisfied with enough to eat and clothes to your backs ? Do you not ever yearn for the pleasures money can buy ? Sill and potatoes . Do they make a man ? A few crowns in a man 's pocket make him feel like a man  --  " No one had answered him . Sigrid had gone to the mainland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manual labor of giving his little help with the digging , drained the color from Morfar 's cheeks ; and the trembling hands gave mute testimony to Sigrid that soon would come the rest he needed . Many times during each night she rose from her bed and silently tiptoed to stand beside him as he slept , to make sure the night-shift rose and fell with steady , even breathing . The days were warmer now , and Sigrid 's flower garden showed promise of a wealth of bloom . Wealth was the word she used as she told her children of the God above who used the flowers as His messengers , to send His love. 110 " God 's love  --  beautiful blooms  --  these are the wealth of the country-folk . " And then one day they heard , and saw , an unfamiliar boat . " Lissie and Karl  --  you go to the boat landing  --  make welcome any who may come ashore ; Morfar and I will await you here . Give thought to your manners , Lissie  --  " The children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm around his shoulders , as together they walked slowly to greet their visitors . Four of them came . " Emissaries of the King , " they called themselves , and asked to greet one " Karl Ivarsson of Norden . " " I am Karl Ivarsson , and I am honored , sirs . " The hand steadied as he returned the warm handclasps extendedby the four . " It is we who are honored , sir , and our King , who has sent you this message in answer to your letter . " The Seal of the King was on the paper , and the signature of the King . And Morfar read . The old blue eyes lighted with the fire of youth as he read his Sovereign 's words accepting the cradle in the name of the people of Sweden , and thanking the fine folk who placed honor high . The children gaped , as with ceremony the messengers of the King accepted the cradle and thanked Karl Ivarsson and Sigrid , and Peter . And they turned to the children . Four children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , one with each . As their hands clasped the children felt something hard press against their palms , and when the hands of the gentlemenwere removed , the something hard clung to their own little palms . " A message from your King , for his children , " they said . Elisabet and Karl , Maria and Johann . The girls curtsied and the boys bowed , as with a " tack " each closed his hand so tight a pulse beat against the thing he held . Farewell to the cradle . Farewell . The parting was brief , but would live forever in the minds and hearts of the family of Norden . They followed the cradle and its111bearers to the boat landing , saw it tenderly placed in the center of the boat and covered with woolen cloth and a tarpaulin over all . They waved farewell . There must be no sadness , Sigrid said , only must they be glad they had had such a fine visitor for so long a time . The room would be bare now without it , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good story . You can write the story of the golden cradle . Will you , Karl ? Then we will have it with us always . In the long winter evenings you can read us the story as we have lived it now and we can sit in the firelight and see the cradle , gently swinging  --  and the gold of it will shine . " " Gold ! Oh , mama , look ! " " Morfar , look ! " " Peter , my husband , see  --  in the children 's hands  --  a gold piece in each ! Elisabet , Karl , Maria , Johann , this is a day to remember ! A gold piece from your King . Keep them always , and you will never be poor . You will never be without money . " " It was the least they could do , " interrupted Peter , " the least . And did they not see there was another child , Herman , sleeping in the cradle ? I will take the gold pieces and put them away . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " As his hand dropped the coins into his pocket , he kept the hand there , dropping the four gold pieces through his fingers , picking them up , dropping them again . He saw himself throwing a gold coin upon the top of a table at the inn , and another gold coin , and answering the questions of his old cronies , " One gold piece or two . . . That is nothing . . . More have I . . . " and , " Oh , just a reward for a little favor I did for King Oskar . . . . " Yes , his day would come . With a smirk he walked back to the house , rapidly , leaving the others to follow at the pace set by Captain Karl Ivarsson . The corner where the cradle had shone , looked bare . That was the corner of honor , where distinguished visitors sat , or the eldest of the group , or the one whose birthday was being celebrated , or the one whose name day it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it was bare. 112Would anything ever be as beautiful or seem so much at home there , as their Morfar 's treasure ? Morfar . He lay in his bed now , not able to raise himself , not needing food , asking only the company of his granddaughter . Misty , bloodshot eyes looked into hers  --  or looked beyond  --  she could not tell . As though , with the delivering of the cradle to the King he had felt his life 's work was done , he had failed from that day . Weeks now had passed , and he lay there failing in body day by day , and failing also in his mind . Again he was a child , swimming in the warm salt water of the Kattegat . Now the circulation in his legs was poor , and he said , " My legs  --  they hurt me here  --  Do you think this is the growing pains ? How long do we have growing pains , before we are grown to be a man ? " Sigrid rubbed his legs and assured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , following the point of the compass  --  gazing at the North Star  --  fighting a deadly storm  --  giving commands  --  calling for Johann  --  calling for Sigrid . Sigrid stayed close to him , cooling his forehead , stroking his hands , answering for each one when he called . The strain of sleeplessnights and full days took its toll and her step was not light , nor her spirits high . This was to be the end of her asylum when in trouble . Now would she have no place of refuge , no one to turn to when living was hard . " Dear , dear Morfar , I would not keep you from your rest  --  but oh , I need you so . " The old man held tightly to her hand as if to help himself as he started his journey . She dozed , sitting there , and he came to her in her dream . He told her he was not leaving her ; that he would be with her , loving her , guiding her , praying for her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor Johann . He sat beside them , grief aging his handsome face . " I seemed to feel he needed me , " said Johann . No more words were needed . They took turns getting rest , and they ministered to their loved one . The children spoke and stepped softly , and the days went by. 113On Sunday , after the church service , came the Reverend Oskarsstri ; ni , and the three who loved him most listened to the rattle come to the throat of Karl Ivarsson. 1lis last words had been " Min alskade Sigrid  --  My beloved Sigrid "  --  and then that sound . It rattled its way into the memories of the listeners , and ached at their hearts . His hands swelled . His breast heaved . Then his eyes opened , just for an instant ; but Sigrid saw that the whites were clear , the blue was deep , as he looked  --  far  --  What did he see ? A smile settled on his features . The rattling noise stopped . " He knows now what some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He who was wiser than us all  --  it is right he should be the first of us to know the answer . " She kissed his lips , his closed eyes , and folded his hands over his breast . She stood looking at him , and the others left her , left her alone with her beloved Morfar . " Yes , Johann , the linen is all ready , fine-spun and dyed . But I could not bring myself to sew it before . " " You should rest , and yet I know you could not rest , no more than I. " Sigrid and the good friend , together , performed the last acts . Kindly . Tenderly . Together they wrapped his body in a covering of wool batting and draped the black linen shroud over the shoulders and down around the body , folding it around and under like a blanket . Peter helped Johann carry in the casket , made by Johann 's own hand . Rosewood , plain , polished and rubbed with linseed oil and loving strokes . So they laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sigrid folded his hands , interlacing the fingers , and set a taper in the opening between the fingers and two thumbs . She lighted the taper and draped folds of black linen around the inside of the casket . Now they must place with him his little heart treasures , his pocket compass , a brass button from his nautical uniform , a lock of his wife 's hair , and a lock of hair from his blond daughter. 114There also , they placed an ore  --  the small piece of money for his last journey . Sigrid hung black linen over the curtains at the windows , set a copper bucket under the hole in the bottom of the casket to catch the drip from the melting ice , and sat wearily down in her chair . She sat looking into the corner , the corner which was no longer bare . The fuchsia , resentful at being crowded into the recess of the window , pushed a branch into the room to prove it could overcomethe darkness of sorrow by bearing blossoms out of season . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasp upon the stems dropped to the floor . Dropping  --  like the drops falling into the copper bucket beneath the casket as the ice melted . DroppingDay after day , night after night . How could she stand it , thought Sigrid , for the full two weeks custom demanded that he lay there ? The rhythmic dropping became torture to her tired nerves . It did not help that Peter , looking at her , ridiculed her tiredness and her appearance . Her hair , which she before had worn braided and arranged as a crown , now was parted in the center and brought down severely over the tops of her ears and twisted into a double roll , or figure eight , low at the back of her neck . What difference did it make ? Nothing mattered , except that here her dear Morfar lay  --  almost decaying in the heat of these midsummer days . They ate in the summer kitchen , and Sigrid sat with them , but could not eat . Johann watched her , wishing he could provide even a little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to fathom why Peter did not take his wife in his arms and comfort her , instead of , " If we had set the casket up in the barn where it belongs , we would not have that dead smell with our meals . " Sigrid swallowed hard . And then , hysterically , " I ca n't see him lying there for ten more days  --  I ca n't  --  oh , Johann , ca n't we have the burial next Sunday ? I ca n't see him  --  " and she swayed as she rose , and would have fallen had not Johann been at her side. 115He lay her on the bunk bed , bathed her face and hands with cold water , and held the cup while she sipped hot tea . Elisabet removed her shoes , then covered her with a linen sheet , and kissed her lips and said , " Mama , we love you . " Johann rowed to the mainland and when he returned , all had been arranged to have the burial service on the next Sunday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Johann said . " He thought it sensible not to wait the full two weeks in this summer weather . " " She always pretended she loved him so much . And now she ca n't get rid of him quick enough . How did you explain that to the Pastor , Johann ? " asked Peter . " The Pastor is a holy man , " answered Johann , " and breeds respect in my thoughts as well as in my spoken word . " His jaw was squared and firm . What would Sigrid 's life be with Peter , without Morfar ? Disappointment , jealousy , eating at the core of Peter , eating so as to blind him to the happiness he could know if he were willing to contribute a tiny fragment of the good in him . Was he merely lazy that he sat with the Book open on his lap , or did he seek solace there for his belief that he was being abused ? Did Peter understand what he read ? Where , in the Good Book could he find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could he ever expect to reap other than the fruit of the seeds he sowed ? Johann 's heart bled for Sigrid . What could be done ? Was there an answer ? Sigrid , who never could have understood that Peter had come to Norden expecting more than Norden had to give . Sigrid , the finest of women , the most noble of mothers , the most capable of housewives . He knew he would never marry . He knew he could never find a woman to compare with this woman whom he admiredabove all others , whom he knew he could love if she were not wife to another . What could he do to ease her burden ? Nothing . Except to give what kindness , what friendliness he could . The hearse met them at the mainland dock . Sorrowfully , respectfully , six old friends  --  the active pallbearers116  --  lifted Karl Ivarsson 's casket from their boat and carried it up the slope to the waiting hearse . Karl Ivarsson 's First Officer and his Mate led the procession to the church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennants proudly but with visible grief . The town dignitariesfollowed , walking with a firm but measured tread , lingering on one foot and then on the other to make the journey slow to the last resting place of their friend . The hearse came then , wheels barely turning , as the welltrainedhorses picked up one hoof , held it high , and returned it slowly to the ground , repeating to keep an even advance with the walking mourners . First the family mourners , Sigrid and Peter and the children , followed by his friends . Friends to Karl Ivarsson were legion . Sigrid , under the heavy long black veil , saw their number and knew the little church could not accommodate them all . The church bell tolled . At each sound of the bell a horse 's hoof touched the ground and good friends stepped one step nearer to the church . Reverently they lifted him from the hearse and carried him through the church doors . Those doors which had opened so joyfullyfor his wedding to a Sigrid of Norden , and had closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he received inspirationto preach from each of his people as he looked into their faces before him , and today they crowded the little church , makinghim eloquent . Seldom had a Pastor been called upon to speak at the burial of a dearer friend . He need not tell them of what a man Karl Ivarsson had been . They knew . He need not tell them of the Captain 's kind and generous deeds . They knew . He need not mention the depth with which his loss would be felt . They knew . But he told them . And he praised the granddaughter who had made the Captain 's last years happy ; and told of her goodness , her illumined imagination inspiring her to see beauty and pleasure117in what many would call burdens and heavy tasks , her Christian character . And he asked God to bless her and keep her , and help her in her day of sorrow . " Jesus said , Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in Me . In My Father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you . They carried him out . Toward the open grave they walked . Sunshine was everywhere except where they walked . The big hot red ball had reached a point in the sky directly behind the church steeple , and cast a pointed shadow , forming the aisle down which they walked . Like the gnomon on a sundial the pointed shadow marked the grave , marking the end of the journey , marking the end of Morfar'sday , marking the end of his life on earth . " Marking the end , " whispered Sigrid . " But marking , too , his bed beside his loved ones . " Sigrid looked at the stones in the churchyard as they passed them , flat and low and sunken , all facing east . So many , many stones . Johann and the five who carried Morfar stopped at the grave and gently laid him , with his head to the west , on stout strips of canvas held tight across the yawning hole . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Pastor read , " Unto Almighty God we commend the soul of our dear friend departed , and we commit his body to the earth ; in sure and certainhope of the Resurrection unto eternal life  --  " The children threw their little bouquets of flowers down onto the casket , the friends passed and whispered adieu , and the gravesmen waited to fill the grave until after the Pastor lifted and cast three shovelsful of earth into the opening . How mournful the sound as the earth struck the wooden casket . How mournful the Pastor 's voice , " Dust thou art , And unto dust thou shalt return . " The women of the church served coffee and small shapes of bread and cheese , and meat , for those who would stay. 118But the family of Norden moved to the churchyard gate . Sigrid stopped at the poor-box , fastened to a post with iron bands . Its sloping roof , meant to keep off the rain , was garlanded and festoonedwith vines . She lifted them aside and draped them over the padlock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent prayer , she dropped a coin. 11JXIV " THEY WILL BE happy here . " The Widow Kvalvog smiled and tightened her arms around the shoulders of Elisabet and Maria , and included Karl with a nod in his direction . " I can not speak the words of thanks I feel in my heart . " Sigrid knew her childhood teacher understood . Where else could she board her children on the mainland where they would get the loving care and the intelligent help with their lessons , while attending the elementarskolan ? Where else could she leave Elisabet knowing , if the cruelty of children became too great , that when she came from school she would find sympathy and understanding and never a mention of the mark or a slur because of it ? Where else could she have brought her children , and to ease the pain in little hearts at this first breaking of home ties , brought Kiki in his cage and Maria 's little lamb Bartolomeus , and Hjarta , too ? It was not need for the little money the boarding would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home , and barn , to Sigrid 's children for the school term . Her son , Per , 120was now a prosperous merchant in Goteborg and provided well for his mother who , widowed before he was born , had been a schoolteacherthrough these many years until her recent retirement . It was her love for Sigrid . And it was her love for her son , to whom she knew she brought happiness by making Sigrid happy . All through the years she had noted the longing in Per 's eyes as he looked toward Sigrid , how after their school years he planned always to be present where she might be , at the manglings , at the burning of the Easter fires , even at the funeral services at the church . Why , feeling so , had he not sought her hand before the stranger from Smaland had come and swept her off her feet and taken her so quickly to wife ? Why ? Her mother heart wondered . But though her son 's eyes spoke of love , his lips spoke not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandell , too . Had Sigrid been blind not to see the love he bore for her ? Had neither Per nor Johann spoken to Sigrid that she should have given herself to this Peter from Smaland ? What was the matter with these men who served careers in good and proper manner , but were so dumb in love ? Yes , her son was dumb ; had he not been , Sigrid 's children here in her arms might have called her Farmor . Oh , it was often hard for a woman to understand men-folk . " Do not worry about not having entered them in the classes before , Sigrid . They have had the best of schooling at home . Let me think , now . Elisabet , you are nine years ; Karl , you are eight ; and little Maria , you are seven . " Yes , you will do fine in your lessons . Without a doubt you will each begin the work beyond the class you would be studying with if you had started here . " " You are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And you have smart children , Sigrid . It will be pleasant for the new teacher to have your children in her classes . " The Widow Elsa Kvalvog knew it would be lonely at home without Morfar , and with but little Johann and the baby , Herman Nikodemus . But it was the middle of September and the school term was about to begin . She had encouraged Sigrid to send the children to her so they might attend the elementary school , larger and having more facilities than the small one-room schoolhouse on the island . If Sigrid felt she could not part with all three , then121let Karl attend the island schoolhouse . The boy might withstand the winter 's trudging ; but better let them all three come . I ere they were , happy to begin a new epoch in their lives , sad to think of their mother leaving , to go back home without them . Bravely , Sigrid bade them adieu . She knelt and kissed Maria on the mouth and on both cheeks , then Karl , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forehead , on the lips , on the right cheek  --  and on the left . " Adieu . Be good . Help your Aunt Elsa all you can so you will not be a burden to her . " Adieu , " and Sigrid gayly waved as she called back to them , " The first of December will be here before long . Then you will come for Christmas , and we will have a happy time ! " Before she turned down the steep road leading to the pier she looked back and waved and saw them standing there , just as she had left them , except that Karl had one of Hjarta 's hooves up in his arms and , though the distance was too great for eyes to see , Sigrid saw that the boy was twisting the long hairs of the fetlock around his forefinger , a loving gesture she often had observed . Yes , it was going to be lonely without them . " But they will be learning , " and Sigrid waved again and turned down the lane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to them , to Karl . Now , they will be learning . Karl will be learning . " As she rowed , she tried to think of other things . It was the fall of the year . She would ask Fru Alvardsson to come and stay with the two young children while she would go with the boats for the herring . One lane after another her mind travelled , but each led to the same ending , the time when Elisabet and Karl and Maria would be home . The little ones at home greeted her with a warmth of welcome which matched the affection she showered upon them . She missed the ever-willing , ever-present help of Elisabet , and scolded herself for having taken more or less for granted the child 's ready assistance . In her chair , rocking , with baby Herman on one arm and Johann on her lap encircled in the other arm , she sang a lullaby , a sea song , and some hymns on this first lonely122night . And then she whispered , " Johann , my big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know , Johann , you are getting to be a big young man  --  soon old enough to go to school , too  --  and I have not taught you , yet , how to knit ! " He answered her smile , as she continued , " Shall we knit for a while now , until it is time for you to go to bed ? Come , I will teach you . " Johann edged close to Sigrid as she sat , shyly he rubbed against her like a little kitten . The color rose and flushed his checks a deep red . " Mama , I do not want to learn how to knit . " " Oh , all right , Johann . I thought you might like to keep me company , but I will knit and you can talk to me while I  --  " " Mama , would n't you rather crochet ? " " I should be knitting . Winter is coming soon , and there are so many of us that need stockings and underwear . Why ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was absorbed in his Bible . Sadness overcame Sigrid as she saw him look . " Peter , oh , Peter , " her heart cried , " why do you choose to earn a glance of fear and pain from the eyes of a child ? " " Mama , will you show me how to crochet ? " Sigrid hugged him . " Of course , I will teach you to crochet . I had no thought you wanted to learn . " From her work basket she brought out a spool of linen thread and a hook . She made a chain and single stitched into it until the piece was firm enough for a beginner to hold . " Now , hold the thread over your left forefinger , so , with the work between your thumb and the finger . Now let the thread fall across the palm of your hand and then wind it once around your little finger , so . That winding around the little finger is what keeps your thread tight or loose , but even . That is called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now you hold the hook in your right hand , so . Pick up the thread which lies across your finger , and draw it up through the loop that is on the needle . " " Is that all there is to it , mama ? " He took the sample of work and placed it in his left hand , draped the thread as she had said , and with almost no further123instruction , crocheted . As the piece grew under his waving needle , the pride of accomplishment lighted his face . He was happy , and he was proud . " What shall I make , mama ? " " Why not use some bright-colored wool and a bigger needle , and make a stocking-cap for Lucifer ? Or would you rather make him a hat ? " They decided after much discussion that as Lucifer was a gentleman sea gull , or at least bore a gentleman 's name , that a stocking-cap would be the more appropriate . And it should have a red and white variegated tassel on the end of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cap as soon as he mastered the chain-stitch , the single-crochet , and the double-stitch . " As soon as you get up in the morning , we will measure Lucifer 's head size , and  --  " Johann already was asleep . Peter sat reading . Sigrid moved to her loom in the corner of the big room , opposite the fireplace . " Strange woman , " thought Peter , " any other woman would go around telling how much she misses her children . She does not even seem to miss them . The same with her grandfather . She pretendedshe cared so much for him , but as soon as he is gone , pft , she has forgotten him . No mourning , no crying . " He looked at her as she threw the shuttle , " And to have watched her with those oldest children , you would have thought the world would end if she did not have them at her side . Now that they are away , does she mourn ? " No . She has no feelings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fickle even with her own flesh and blood . " He built to his hatred of her as he sat looking at her . Why , sometimes , did she not storm and rave at him so he could subdue her , thereby putting her in her place and showing himself master of the situation ? He hated her utter indifference toward him . Was he mistaken , or had this indifference grown more pronounced since the day he had struck Elisabet and she had fallen into the hole in the barnyard ? He tried to remember if , during the intervening time she had124addressed him but could remember only her answers if and when he had spoken to her . So that was her game . Well , let her tongue cleave to the roof of her mouth . " I will go to the inn as often as I have the wherewithal . Plenty are there at the inn who think Peter Kristianssoei not a bad fellow . " And to himself he justified his action in striking Elisabet , the " bear-face " who so forgot her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle , inlaid with a little copper gull , flew forth and back between the blue and white linen threads of the warp she had mounted on the loom . As she wove , she thought of Elisabet and Karl and Maria . Were they asleep in the unfamiliar beds , or were their pillows damp with tears of homesickness ? Nervously she threw the shuttle , breathing a prayer of thanks for her good friend , Elsa Kvalvog , chubby , good-natured , generous , brilliant , fun-loving Elsa Kvalvog . A peace settled over her . Her mind 's eye traversed the distance between this room and a cheery room on the mainland and she saw her friend with Maria on her fat lap , Elisabet on one side of the couch and Karl on the other . And she was reading to them . The morning broke bright and clear . Sigrid had scrubbed the pine board in the toilet room . She had fed and watered the stock , and turned them out to graze in the shortening day . The morning was empty . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria , without Kiki and the lamb and Hjarta ? " Oh , dear God above , help me to hide my grief and my lonelinessso Johann and little Herman shall not see and be sad . Help me to be gay , so they can be gay , as little children should be . " She walked past the little aspen tree in the houseyard , and trembled as she heard the wail of its quivering leaves . Once inside , she sang out , " Oh , Johann my JohannIt 's time to arise . Come , Johann my Johann Come , see your surprise . " 125The surprise was French pancakes , thin , fried in butter so the edges were crisp and holey like shirred brown lace . This was his favorite breakfast and he ate the pancakes joyously , drinking fresh milk between bites , and telling his mother soon he would be big enough to stand over the griddle in her place to fry the pancakesas fast as she and Peter could make them disappear ! " Before I go to the fields , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little stocking-cap and work on it while I work tonight . " Out in the houseyard they sat on the ground close to each other , tailor fashion , and watched Lucifer strut . Sigrid drew the tape and made great sport of measuring his head . She touched him and he ducked . She tried again and as he ducked , he snapped with his bill trying to take the tape from her . Johann laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks , and finally Sigrid was sure she would be able to judge the proper size , so they must now get to their work . " I would like to help you in the field , mama , but I will stay and watch Herman so he does not hurt himself , and I can crochet when he sleeps . I love to crochet , mama . I could sit and crochet all day long ! " Sigrid laughed at his seriousness . " You are a fine helper , Johann . I will get through in the barley field as soon as I can , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing my children are to me , " Sigrid spoke aloud as she walked , " if only Peter  --  " She stopped to pet the horses . They neighed and rolled back their lips . The gulls which flew low reminded her that one day soon the mackerel would be calling the island men to the water . And soon the herring would be running . Again she would encouragePeter to go with the men . She would try . But already she knew what his answer would be . It had never varied . " Tomorrow and its needs will be taken care of , tomorrow . The Lord will provide for me today , and food for today is all I ask . " And he would turn to her , gesticulating with both palms upward , and say , " Is there not sill still in the salt kegs ? " Yes , she would encourage him . But she knew who would go126with the men for the fishing if the salt kegs were to be replenished . She had followed the calling gulls , and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea  --  the solace of the sea . " Merely to look at the water was a source of comfort , a consolation in her loneliness . She stood refreshed after the hard work in the barley field , breathing deeply of the salt air , the wind blowing her clothing close against her body . The ceaseless energy of the water repeated itself in her as she turned and with long , rhythmic strides walked to the dwelling and her two young children . Johann came running to meet her , the sample of crocheting waving high as he ran . " I started a chain all by myself ! And I can take a double-stitch tool " To reward him Sigrid brought out some of her best wool yarn , brilliant red , and gave it to the pleased little boy . " Will you start it for me ? " " Oh , you must do it all by yourself . Lucifer would not want me to work on his stocking-cap . Rather would he have his good friend , Johann , make it entirely , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched him . Bent over , intent on his work , his tongue moved inside his cheek as he chewed on it and churned in rhythm to the plying of the crochet hook . And when his fingers fumbled and he tried to pick up the stitch he had lost , the tongue extended straight out from his mouth , but the teeth still chewed against it . His small hands dropped to his lap . It was as though his heart lay there broken into a million pieces , beyond repair , and his tearfilledeyes looked up at Sigrid , asking for her help . Her reassuring smile was all he needed . He knew her magic fingers would restore the vagrant stitch . Karl loved the stories of the sea . He had loved the tales the old Captain had told  --  of ships and schooners , of wind filling a studdingsail or a mizzentop gallant staysail  --  of a flying jib or a spanker . Yes , Karl loved the sea . And now he was to gain his first intimate knowledge of a fishing on the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might accompany her , 127yet , this was learning too . He could make up the lessons he would miss in these few days away from school . She saw him as he watched the men . How glad she was for his company on this fishing for mackerel . He had grown from a boy , who would not be nine years old until next February , into a man almost as soon as he had stepped aboard the boat . His childish solicitude of her welfare , his efforts to bear the heaviest portion of their burden , these were things to make a mother 's heart glad . Karl marvelled at the respect the fishermen had for his mother , the only woman aboard . Although the work of spreading the drift nets and bringing in the catch did not allow any one of them a moment for " resting his hands on his oars , " still it seemed to Karl that the men gave more than the utmost of their strength , more than their level best , to compensate because one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karl and his manner told her he was proud of her . But he had seemed worried as he had asked her why did his father not join the men . Why did she fish for mackerel ? " Because I like mackerel , " she had replied , hugging him . If Peter had been there he would have seen Karl 's eager face as they brought their catch to the mainland , to sell what they could to the merchant who came to buy . There was plenty , too , for all of the families . " We will sell the mackerel fourteen inches long , or over , and divide the rest equally among us all , " decided the men . " And Fru Kristiansson shall be our spokesman , " they voted , " She can out-trade any man amongst us . Is it not so ? " When they stood watching her sparring with the fish merchant , they knew their choice had been well made . Not only her crew , but the members of crews of other fishing smacks , profited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon reached all , that the island fisherwoman was holding out for a fair price , and the loyalty of the seamen to each other did not allow , for an instant , the thought of anyone underselling her . They came ashore from other vessels , leaving their mackerel swimming in the wells aboard the smacks , losing their fatigue in watching the calm but capable tradeswoman . " No . For your price we will not sell . Rather we take our128mackerel home and feed it to our children  --  and our cattle . Adieu , sir . " Karl stepped forward , sure of himself , stretching to his full boyish height , and spoke , " If my mother says your price is low , it is too low . You ask Pastor Oskarsstrom , he will tell you , she is the most fair person in all of Sweden . " After the surprised hush , came a cheer . The fishermen threw their caps into the air and crowded to tell Sigrid they would turn their mackerel back into the sea rather than sell to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the fish merchant put his hands on Karl 's two shoulders as he stood back of him , and raising his voice , cried out , " The boy has decided me . The woman 's price , I deem , is fair . And I am willing to pay . " Cheers for Sigrid KristianssonCheers for KarlHe took her hand , and they were proud of each other . But prouder still was she when late on the night they returned to Norden he came to her shyly , pieces of hay in his hair and on the front of his clothing , and told her he had been lying on his stomach in the hayloft , by the light of a candle , writing a story . Would she like to hear it ? She would . Indeed she would , but quietly , so as not to awaken Peter . Ile had written of the papa mackerel , long and sleek , green with blue bars on his back and smooth silvery belly ; likening the green and the blue to the green and blue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pattern of rows of clouds in the sky before a rain . The papa mackerel swam all the northern seas , never caring to near the shore until one day he met a mama mackerel and together they joined a huge school , to swim near to the coast of Sweden to spawn . They were caught in the nets of the fishermen ! Karl followed the journey into the dark well of the fishing smack . The papa mackerel was like as if he were blind ; he could not see . He did not know if his mama mackerel was near him . He was alone , like Morfar . And then the merchant bought him , and the story ended , 129 " I am glad the fish merchant bought the big papa mackerel . He was a fine papa mackerel , and I would not want to eat him . " To Sigrid , it was a work inspired . " Vill du , vill du , vill du , vill du , t4l du Med mig ut till marknaden gd ? Ja men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streek her skola stu . " " Do you each have thirty streaks ? " The children screamed in the merriment of trying to make the thirtieth mark come just at the end of the verse , " Will you " ( repeatedfive times ) " with me to the market go ? " and then , " Yes but , sure but , yes but , sure but ; Thirty strokes here shall stand , " that the Widow Kvalvog quoted . They sensed the rhythm as she spoke , and drew the lines in perfect time . Sigrid looked in at the window and saw them there . What a long month since she had brought them to her teacher 's home ; was it truly less than a fortnight since Karl had returned after the fishing for mackerel ? The Widow Kvalvog 's fat shivered like soft jelly as she laughed with the children . Sigrid rapped against the pane . Such screaming then , as they rushed to the door to welcome her and Johann and the baby . Such hilarity , such affection ! " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , Sigrid . We have all of our morning 's tasks finished , and were startingto play . " " Fine , fine . I have brought a picnic basket , with plenty for us all . Will you like to spend this beautiful Saturday in the woods , and  --  " " Oh , mama , yes . Yes , " chorused the children . " Let us see what we have to take along . " " No , Elsa Kvalvog , I have plenty  --  plenty . Let us go . The day grows short . Let us waste no time , but spend as much of it as possible out in the open . " They went to the forest , close by . Elisabet walked close to her mother , carrying first the picnic basket and then little Herman when tired , alternating with Sigrid . Was there a shyness ; a reti-130cence , a humility , a hurt , in Elisabet 's manner ? Sigrid sensed rather than saw , and noticed how , when she came close to her mother , Elisabet seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only imagine this ? They trod on a carpet of leaves and evergreen needles , and stopped to pick the last of the blue juniper berries from the shrubs . The warm , pungent taste of the berries made them thirsty ; and when they came to a running brook Sigrid took her fine woolen scarf from her head , strained the water through the scarf , then gave it to the children to drink . After they had eaten the lunch , they sat in a circle on the ground and told of the days they had spent apart from each other , and how they had missed each other , and how much they had learned . Elisabet played her harmonica and they sang . But the days grow short this time of the year , so they started back . " If we all carry as many fir branches as our arms will hold , we will have plenty to make warm covers for our dear ones who lie in the churchyard . " Like the woods of Birnam they came , bringing fir boughs to the churchyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer  --  and the others which for none but Sigrid and her teacher , held memories . Elisabet , Karl , and Maria , with the teacher , walked with Sigrid and the two younger ones to the boat . As they kissed adieu , and waved , and watched , they knew how much their mother loved them . Sigrid rowed the boat and chatted . Herman slept , but Johann talked and talked and planned for the time when he , too , would go to the mainland to school . She would remember this day , this food for the hungry heart . And they all would look forward with happiness to the homecoming for the Yuletide . " The first of December is not far away , " she said to her husband when she came home . " Peter , you should have come with us  --  ' and she remembered , with a shock , that not one of them had asked why he had not come . Nor had she remembered to speak his name . Two rose-colored sea shells rattling against a tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shovel to help to find the golden cradle  --  the click of fine steel needles stitching thin hair-like blue yarn , the spitting of the log fire in the grate , kept company with the swaying , bobbing crochet hook in the fingers of little Johann as he chewed on his tongue and finishedthe last decrease on the narrow end of a red stocking-cap . Now Johann made a tassel for the pointed end of the cap and it was finished . They placed it on Lucifer 's head , and tied it on under his chin , with two tiny tassels banging from a bow knot . Lucifer 's sharp dark eyes seemed to twinkle as lie strutted before them , the end of the stocking-cap falling alongside his right breast , the tassel almost touching the ground . His right foot lightly kicked the tassel as he walked , swinging it forward . And it swung back to be kicked again as he took another step . He strutted up and down in front of them . Proud . Like a mannequinin a Parisian salonSigrid and Johann looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they had to hold their middles to keep them from splitting open . IMXV " ANGELS IN the snow ! " Sigrid very carefully raised herself from where she had been lying flat on her back with arms outstretched on the pure white sheet of newly fallen snow , carefully , so as not to disturb the outline formed when she had lain sprawled full length , spreading her legs wide apart to make the impression of a long skirt and moving her arms up and down on the snow to mark the contour of wings . She leaned over Elisabet and grabbed her hands and with a quick pulling movement raised her from the imprint she had made ; went to Karl and Maria and Johann with the same nimble assistance , and picked baby Herman up under the arms and swung him high into the air and then held him , with his redcheckedface close to hers , as they looked at the " angels in the snow . They restricted their footsteps so as to keep them all in the " floor " on which the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  steps in height , from Elisabet who was almost ten to Herman Nikodemus who was not quite one. 133 " Those are the best we ever made , " laughed Maria , as she clapped her hands and jumped up and down . " We did n't spill even a little bit of snow over the edges to spoil the outlines . " " You see , mama , going to school has made us very smart ! " " Oh , it is wonderful to have you all home again . But now we have celebrated and played enough . We have less than a fortnight to Santa Lucia 's Day , and there is much to be done . " Sigrid put her arm around Elisabet . " My dearest Lissie , I have missed you . Nothing that has been done since you have been away , has been done quite as well as if you were here . " " I have wished every day to be here . " " You  --  children  --  try to build a swan or a cow , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the Tomte gubbe . Karl , you look to Herman . Lissie and I will go to the storehouse . " Arms about each other , they turned away . " Now , Lissie , tell me . How did it go for youFThe fair cheek , which already was pink from the cold , grew pinker and wide blue eyes looked upward into Sigrid 's . " Aunt Elsa was so good to us , mama . I love Aunt Elsa . Next to you , I like her best of all . Well , maybe next to you comes Big Johann . " Dreamily , " Did you ever think , mama , how nice it would be if papa was more like Big Johann , so he would play with the other children and me ? and  --  " with a nod of her head  --  " yes , next to him comes Aunt Elsa . But  --  ' A shiver that was almost a convulsion passed over her as , with that remote look Sigrid had seen before , she said , " I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her embrace and waited for Elisabet to speak further , but she did not . They came to the cellar-like storehouse . As they entered , Sigrid lighted the whale oil lamp swinging from overhead . An eery yellow glow showed them the shelves built all around . And on these shelves , the round shallow bowls of milk on which the cream was rising , the cream to make butter . " Let me churn , will you , mama , tonight ? " Each of them carried a large bowlful of cream back to the dwellinghouse to be ready for the churning of the evening , and they , stopped to look and be astonished when they saw what the134children had built of snow . Maria , her mittens off , stooped before a statue moulding a chubby broad nose set below wide round eyes , and above a thick mustache and flowing beard . A pointed cap hid his hair and his body was partly hidden by the frail trunk of the aspen tree . Two chubby hands clasped the trunk as the Troll peeked from behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if all of us are good ! " " Maria , that is a beautiful Tomte gubbe . Did Aunt Elsa teach you to sculp , too ? " Proudly Elisabet praised her younger sister , "  --  h , Aunt Elsa said she should be a sculptress . Aunt Elsa said she never saw anyone who could take , even a piece of meat suet , and form things so you could tell what they were . " " You are angels , all of you . And now , for the first day you have been back home , perhaps you have played enough . But tomorrow we will all help to make a pretty tableau vivant out here in the yard , of snow people , and ice . Think about what we shall make , and we will tell our thoughts tomorrow . " They left the little Troll to peek from behind the tree , to keep a gentle eye on the new homespun linen sheets spread wide and flat on the snow to bleach . Chatter , chatter , and the evening meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was high . Peter , looking at her , thought he had never seen her looking so well . She had braided her hair and set the crown of it high , as she used to do . He saw the love she had for her children beam like a halo around her and had the feeling that if perhaps he saw her at a table at the inn tonight , her face alight , candlelight playing on her golden hair , perhaps he might seek a seat beside her The innBut his pockets were empty . He dug deep into his pockets . And then he saw her as , to him , she was  --  almost a fiend  --  depriving him of what he felt was his . There had been money from the season 's catch of herring , but had he any of it ? No . Rather she would use it to send the children to school on the mainland . And the little that was left , she kept . For necessities , she said . He thought of his uncle whom he had visited once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a135small , worn purse with clasped metal closure , opening the clasps , turning out pennies into his lap , counting the pennies one by one , dropping them back into the purse one by one and closing the top with a click of the two round steel knobs of the clasp . Opening it  --  counting  --  closing it  --  gloating over the pennies  --  letting them fall between his fingers  --  repeating it all , endlessly . The old miser faded and became Peter 's own wife as he dwelt on the picture , and he visualized her sitting in his uncle 's place counting pennies from a worn purse . He looked at her again . No . He would not seek a seat beside her if she sat at the inn . Her face was too pinched , her eyes too big , her nose too long , her lips too thin . And she was too old . Elisabet worshipped her . Every breath and every look was an avowal of it . Karl seemed more quiet than before he had gone away to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , and wondered . He would not have been able to put his question into words , but he wondered . What alienated them ? Why was his mother not free and friendly with his father as she was with them , as she had been with Morfar ? Why did she labor while he sat and smoked and read in the Bible ? He looked at his mother 's hands . The veins stood out heavy and blue , and her knuckles were enlarged and had cracked places on them . The palms were calloused . An angry-looking wen distortedthe back of her right hand , and there was a wen on the pulse of her right wrist . Why were her hands not smooth and white like his teacher 's at the school ? Even Aunt Elsa Kvalvog , who was an old , old woman , had finer hands than these of his mother 's . His mother was not as smart as he had thought . Not smart enough to have beautiful hands . And as he watched those hands undo her dress bosom as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a feeling of revulsion swept over him ; he could not imagine his teacher doing this . His brother Herman nursing there would not be a year old until Christmas Day , Karl reflected , but already he could see his mother 's body rounding with another child . Oh , he could tell ; did136he not see the cows when they were with their young , and the cats and the dogs ? He thought of his teacher , trim , svelte , and his eyes followed the outline of his mother 's figure . His supper churned inside of him and made him sick . " Peter , tomorrow perhaps you will take Karl and Johann down to the woodlot and pick out a tree  --  the prettiest fir in the whole woodlot  --  for our Yule tree ! " " I want to go too , mama . " " Lissie and I could well use your help here , Maria . " " Let her go if she likes to , " fondly spoke up Elisabet , " I will do her work and mine too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says yes , then Lissie and I can manage here . " " Now , that is more like it should be , " said Peter to himself , " it should always be what papa says , " and aloud , " We will see what the morning brings . " He sat with his Bible open on his lap . Karl read aloud as Elisa bet churned and Johann crocheted , and Maria lay prone on the floor , her chin cupped in her hands and elbows resting on the floor , listening . From Andersen 's book of fairy stories , of course they chose that Karl should read " The Fir Tree . " When they heard of the Yule Tree 's disappointment on the morning after its " happiest evening , " when the servants and the chambermaid came in , and it thought , " Now my splendor will begin afresh .... But they dragged him out of the room , and upstairs into a garret , and here they put him in a dark corner where no daylight shone ... : ' the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go on the morrow to the woods to mark a fir tree for cutting , yes . But after " robbing the tree " on Christmas Eve they would remove it gently from the room , and set it upright in the houseyard where it could see the sky . These were busy days . Every bit of the house and barn must be scrubbed clean before the Christmas season . There were the candles to be dipped , candles for the Yule table , and seven smaller candles to fit the crown of Santa Lucia . Sigrid looped the wicking over a stick about a foot and a half long but left a space in the center for the hand hold , long loops on137her stick and shorter loops on Elisabet 's shorter stick . They dipped them into warm melted tallow , drew them up and let the wicking drip , dipped them again and let them drip , until they were of the desired thickness . On Elisabet 's stick were seven wicks . " Mama , Maria is so pretty . Do you not think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear the crown , and  --  ' " No , Lissie , you are to be our Santa Lucia . Maria will have many pleasures , too , but the eldest daughter is the one to wear the crown and the white dress and serve coffee and Lussekaka on her day . " " But , Maria would be such a pretty Lucia . " Sigrid saw the pain the child was suffering , and prayed again for the time to come when they might hear from the doctor friend of Morfar . They hung the candles to cool and harden . Sigrid had butchered a seven-week calf and the boar whose head would grace the Yule feast ; and they added to the stores , blood pudding and pigs ' feet stowed in brine . What wonderful smells hung in the airlKarl proudly announced he had located the finest fir tree in the forests , to be cut on Christmas Eve and brought in with ceremony to be trimmed . And Maria and Johann had stumbled onto a perfectlog for the Yule fire . And they all stopped working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and build the snow tableau . Between cooking and cleaning , for days they worked rolling balls of snow at Maria 's direction , placing them here , placing them there ; all the others doing the crude preliminary work and Maria , with the help of her mother , doing the finishing  --  the fine touches . Now , in the dusk of early afternoon , they saw the Tomte gubbe peering from behind the aspen tree and seeing an almost lifesizedhorse , with reins held taut in the hand of a man who stood on the little step at the back of a low , small sleigh . Shafts led from the runners to the horse 's sides , and they were long thin branches from the floor of the woodlot , covered with snow packed firmly to the bark . The front of the little sleigh was rounded like a blanket over the feet of the rider , a woman with a " fur " turban on her head , icy ear muffs , and a huge snow muff covering her hands and the front of her. 138Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady , the man , the Tomte gubbe , and the animals . With a stick Maria drew double lines in the snow in back of the sleigh to mark the path it had left behind , and the print of the hooves between the sleigh marks . And here was a hare , undecided whether to jump and run or stay where he was and watch . An icy owl sat in the crotch of the aspen tree , and the dusk threw a shadow from the perfect shape of a reindeer  --  still , regal  --  its dignity , stateliness , nobility , reflected in the blue-gray shadow on the snow . In these early December days , the dwelling house seemed transformed into a bakery . There stood round loaves of limpa , two loaves braced against each other to cool . There were loaves of plain wheat bread in which Sigrid put a little pine bark to give a different flavor , and smell . The tall milk can into which the daily potato water went to feed the yeast , gave and gave . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas cake of breads , full of citron and raisins and flavored with ground cardamom seeds . And there were Finnish breads and spritsar and gingersnaps ! Now came the test for these little artists . Out of the rolled gingersnap dough Elisabet and Maria cut and decorated angels with wings and holding candles , hearts with daisies on , stars , Christmas bells , roosters , a big pig with Nasse written on him and a little pig with Nisse , cats with long tails and hunched-up backs , one cat named Misse and one Kisse . Sigrid sent all the family to skate on the lake while she should make the " Lucia Gingersnaps . " These they were not to see until the Lucia Day should come . A busy time . A happy time , . Now came the ninth of December , when they must start to get the lut fink ready for Christmas Eve . All of the children followed Sigrid to the storehouse , to help pick out the finest of the ling which hung there . They watched her cut each fish into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub , and cover the pieces with cold fresh water .

Through his only availablewindows  --  the narrow eyes of Laurel 's youth  --  he had seen Delia 's husband as a pompous and tyrannical old cock , crippled but rampant , ruling his roost with a beak of iron ; and from this it followedthat the wife must be a gray-feathered hennypenny , preening herself emptily in corners , one of Bullock 's elderly barnyard trade ... a dumpy , nervous , insignificant old biddy . But the woman in his doorway was no helpless fowl , to be plucked , swallowed , and forgotten . Delia Priam was of a far different species , higher in the ranks of the animal kingdom , and she would linger on the palate . She was so much younger than his mental sketch of her that only much later was Ellery to recognize this as one of her routine illusions , among the easiest of the magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that time he was to discover that she was forty-four , but the knowledge remained as physically meaningless as  --  the figure leaped into his mind  --  learning the chronological age of Ayesha .

It was the most naked juvenility , and Ellery was duly amused at himself . But there she was , a glowing end in herself ; it took only imagination , a commodity with which he was plentifully provided , to supply the veils . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 2IDelia Priam was big game ; one glance told him that . His doorway framed the most superbly proportioned woman he had ever seen . She was dressed in a tawny peasant blouse of some sheer material and a California print skirt of bold colors . Her heavy black hair was massed to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion ; she wore plain broad hoops of gold in her ears . Head , shoulders , bust , hips  --  he could not decide which pleased him more . She stood there not so much in an attitude as in an atmosphere  --  an atmosphere of intense repose , watchful and disquieting . By Hollywood standards she was not beautiful : her eyes were too deep and light-tinted , her eyebrows too lush ; her mouth was too full , her coloring too high , her figure too heroic . But it was this very excessivenessthat excited  --  a tropical quality , humid , brilliant , still , and overpowering . Seeing her for the first time was like stepping into a jungle . She seized and held the senses ; everything was leashed , lovely , and dangerous . He found his ears trying to recapture her voice , the sleepy growl of something heard from a thicket .

Her large , shapely hands rested precisely in the middle of her lap , like compass points . " Mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs . . . " Right out of Browning 's Renaissance .

" It would have to have been an awfully small one , Laurel . The box was n't more than a foot square , of cardboard . " " Unmarked ? " asked Ellery . " Yes .

He became conscious of the two women 's eyes and expelled a mouthful of smoke , trying to appear professional . " Leander Hill received a queer gift , and he died . Are you afraid , Mrs. Priam , that your husband 's life is in danger , too ? " Now he was more than a piece of merchandise ; he was a piece of merchandise that interested her .

" " She did n't say what part ? " " What part ? " said Ellery . " Then she did n't . Why , Mr. Queen , my husband is paralyzed , " said Delia Priam with a smile , " from the waist down . " You had to admire the way she said that . The brave smile . The smile that said Do n't pity me . " I 'm very sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " Ellery was silent . She rested her head against the back of the chair . Her eyes were almost closed and her throat was strong and defenseless . " You 're wondering why I told you that . " Ellery nodded . " I told you because you ca n't understand why I 've come to you unless you understand that first . Were n't you wondering ? " " All right . Why have you come to me ? " " For appearance 's sake . " Ellery stared . " You ask me to investigate a possible threat against your husband 's life , Mrs. Priam , for appearance 's sake ? " " You do n't believe me . " " I do believe you . Nobody would invent such a reason ! " Seating himself beside her , he took one of her hands . It was cool and secretive , and it remained perfectly lax in his . " You have n't had much of a life . " " What do you mean ? " " You 've never done any work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It could be . " Ellery put her hand back in her lap . " A woman likeTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 27you has no right to remain tied to a man who 's half-dead . If he were some saintly character , if there were love between you , I 'd understand it . But I gather he 's a brute and that you loathe him . Then why have n't you done something with your life ? Why have n't you divorcedhim ? Is there a religious reason ? " " There might have been when I was young . Now . . . " She shook her head . " Now it 's the way it would look . You see , I 'm stripping myself quite bare . " Ellery looked pained . " You 're very gallant to an old woman . " She laughed . " No , I 'm serious , Mr. Queen . I come from one of the old California families . Formal upbringing . Convent-trained . Duennas in the old fashion . A pride of caste and tradition . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother had married a heretic from New England . They ostracized her and it killed her when I was a little girl . I 'd have got away from them completely , except that when my mother died they talked my father into giving me into their custody .

I did n't love him , but he had money , we were very poor , and I anted to escape . It cut me off from my family , my church , and my world . I have a ninety-year-old grandmother who lives only three miles from this spot . I have n't seen her for eighteen years . She considers me dead . " Her head rolled . " Harvey died when we 'd been married three years , leaving me with a child . Then I met Roger Priam . I could n't go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of his jaunts , and Roger attracted me . I would have followed him to hell . " She laughed again . " And that 's exactly where he led me . " When I found out what Roger really was , and then when he becamecrippled and I lost even that , there was nothing left . I 've filled the vacuum by trying to go back where I came from . " It has n't been easy , " murmured Delia Priam . " They do n't forget such things , and they never forgive . But the younger generation is softer-bottomed and corrupted by modern ways . Their men , of course , 28 THE ORIGIN OF EVILhave helped . . . Now it 's the only thing I have to hang on to . " Her face showed a passion not to be shared or relished . Ellery was glad when the moment passed . " The life I lead in Roger Priam 's house is n't even suspected by these people . If they knew the truth , I 'd be dropped and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'd say I deserted my husband . Upper caste women of the old California society do n't do that sort of thing , Mr. Queen ; it does n't matter what the husband is . So . . . I do n't do it . " Now something is happening , I do n't know what . If Laurel had kept her mouth shut , I would n't have lifted a finger . But by going about insisting that Leander Hill was murdered , Laurel 's created an atmosphere of suspicion that threatens my position . Sooner or later the papers will get hold of it  --  it 's a wonder they have n't already  --  and the fact that Roger is apparently in the same danger might come out . I ca n't sit by and wait for that . My people will expect me to be the loyal wife . So that 's what I 'm being . Mr. Queen , I ask you to proceed as if I 'm terribly concerned about my husband 's safety . " Delia Priam shrugged . " Or is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to me far simpler , " said Ellery , " to clear out and start over again somewhere else . " " This is where I was born . " She looked out at Hollywood . Laurel had moved over to a corner of the garden . " I do n't mean all that popcornand false front down there . I mean the hills , the orchards , the old missions . But there 's another reason , and it has nothing to do with me , or my people , or Southern California . " " What 's that , Mrs. Priam ? " " Roger would n't let me go . He 's a man of violence , Mr. Queen . You do n't  --  you ca n't  --  know his furious possessiveness , his pride , his compulsion to dominate , his . . . depravity . Sometimes I think I 'm married to a maniac . " She closed her eyes . The room was still . From below Ellery heard Mrs. Williams 's Louisiana-bred tones complaining to the gold parakeet she kept in a cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An invisible finger was writing in the sky above the Wilshire district : MUNTZ TV . The empty typewriter nudged his elbow . But there she sat , the jungle in batiste and colored cotton . His slickTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 29and characterless Hollywood house would never be the same again . It was exciting just to be able to look at her lying in the silly chair . It was dismaying to imagine the chair empty . " Mrs. Priam . " " Yes ? " " Why , " asked Ellery , trying not to think of Roger Priam , " did n't you want Laurel Hill to hear what you just told me ? " The woman opened her eyes . " I do n't mind undressing before a man , " she said , " but I do draw the line at -a woman . " She said it lightly , but something ran up Ellery 's spine . He jumped to his feet . " Take me to your husband . " Z'ireeWHEN THEY CAME out of Ellery 's house Laurel said pleasantly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if so , with which one of us ? Or is the question incompetent and none of my business ? " " No contract , " said Ellery testily . " No contract , Laurel . I 'm just going to take a look around . " " Starting at the Priam house , of course . " " Yes . " " In that case , since we 're all in this together  --  are n't we , Delia ?  --  I suppose there 's no objection if I trail along ? " " Of course not , darling , " said Delia . " But do try not to antagonize Roger . He always takes it out on me afterwards . " " What do you think he 's going to say when he finds out you 've brought a detective around ? " " Oh , dear , " said Delia . Then she brightened . " Why , darling , you 're bringing Mr. Queen around , do n't you see ? Do you mind very much ? I know it 's yellow , but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Queen first . " " All right , " said Laurel with a shrug . " We 'll give you a head start , Delia . You take Franklin and Outpost , and I 'll go around the long way , over Cahuenga and Mulholland . Where have you been , shop-ping ? " Delia Priam laughed . She got into her car , a new cream Cadillac convertible , and drove off down the hill . " Hardly a substitute , " said Laurel after a moment . Ellery started . Laurel was holding open the door of her car , a tiny green Austin . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 31 " Either car or driver . Can you see Delia in an Austin ? Like the Queen of Sheba in a rowboat . Get in . " " Unusual type , " remarked Ellery absently , as the little car shot off . " The adjective , yes . But as to the noun , " said Laurel , " there is only one Delia Priam . " " She seems remarkably frank and honest . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " It does n't matter what I think . " " By which you tell me what you think . " " No , you do n't ! But if you must know . . . You never get to the bottom of Delia . She does n't lie , but she does n't tell the truth , either  --  I mean the whole truth . She always keeps something in reserve that you dig out much , much later , if you 're lucky to dig it out at all . Now I 'm not going to say anything more about Delia , because whatever I say you 'll hold , not against her , but against me . Delia bowls over big shots especially . . . I suppose it 's no use asking you what she wanted to talk to you alone about ? " " Take  --  it  --  easy , " said Ellery , holding his hat . " Another bounce like that and my knees will stab me to death . " " Nice try , Laurel , " said Laurel ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a savage flip of her exhaust . After a while Ellery remarked to Laurel 's profile : " You said something about Roger Priam 's never ' leaving his wheelchair . You did n't mean that literally , by any chance ? " " Yes . Not ever . Did n't Delia tell you about the chair ? " " No . " " It 's fabulous . After Roger became paralyzed he had an ordinary wheelchair for a time , which meant he had to be lifted into and out of it . Daddy told me about it . It seems Roger the Lion-Hearted could n't take that . It made him too dependent on others . So he designed a special chair for himself . " " What does it do , boost him in and out of bed on mechanical arms ? " 32 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " It does away with a bed altogether . " Ellery stared . " That 's right . He sleeps in it , eats in it , does his work in it  --  everything . A combination office , study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's quite a production . From one of the arms of the chair hangs a small shelf which he can swing around to the front and raise ; he eats on that , mixes drinks , and so on . Under the shelf are compartments for cutlery , napkins , cocktail things , and liquor . There 's a similar shelf on the other arm of the chair which holds his typewriter , screwed on , of course , so it wo n't fall off when it 's swung aside . And under that shelf are places for paper , carbon , pencils and Lord knows what else . The chair is equipped with two phones of the plug-in type  --  the regular line and a private wire to our house  --  and with an intercom system to Wallace 's room . " " Who 's Wallace ? " " Alfred Wallace , his secretary-companion . Then  --  let 's see . " Laurel frowned . " Oh , he 's got compartments and cubbyholes all around the chair for just about everything imaginable  --  magazines , cigars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possiblyneed . The chair 's built so that it can be lowered and the front raised , making a bed out of it for daytime napping or sleeping at night . Of course , he needs Alfred to help him sponge-bathe and dress and undress and so on , but he 's made himself as self-sufficient as possible  --  hates help of any kind , even the most essential . When I was there yesterday his typewriter had just been sent into Hollywoodto be repaired and he had to dictate business memoranda to Alfred instead of doing them himself , and he was in such a foul mood because of it that even Alfred got mad . Roger in a foul mood can be awfully foul ... I 'm sorry , I thought you wanted to know . " " What ? " " You 're not listening . " " I am , though not with both ears . " They were on Mulholland Drive now , and Ellery was clutching the side of the Austin to avoid being thrown clear as Laurel zoomed the little car around the hairTHEORIGIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who inherits your father 's estate ? I mean besides yourself ? " " Nobody . There is n't anyone else . " " He did n't leave anything to Priam ? " " Why should he ? Roger and Daddy were equal partners . There are some small cash bequests to people in the firm and to the householdhelp . Everything else goes to me . So you see , Ellery , " said Laurel , soaring over a rise , " I 'm your big suspect . " " Yes , " ) said Ellery , " and you 're also Roger Priam 's new partner . Or are you ? " " My status is n't clear . The lawyers are working on that now . Of course I do n't know anything about the jewelry business and I 'm not sure I want to . Roger ca n't chisel me out of anything , if that 's what 's in your mind . One of the biggest law firms in Los Angeles is protectingmy interests . I must say Roger 's been surprisingly decent about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Daddy 's death hit him harder than he expected  --  made him realize how important Dad was to the business and how unimportant he is . Actually , he has n't much to worry about . Dad trained a very good man to run things , a Mr. Foss , in case anything happened to him . . . Anyway , there 's one item on my agenda that takes priority over everything else . And if you wo n't clear it up for me , I 'll do it myself . " " Because you loved Leander Hill very much ? " " Yes ! " " And because , of course , " remarked Ellery , " you are the big sur-pect ? " Laurel 's little hands tightened on the wheel . Then they relaxed . " That 's the stuff , Ellery , " she laughed . " Just keep firing away at the whites of our eyes . I love it .  --  There 's the Priam place . " THE PRIAM PLACE stood on a private road , a house of dark round stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept in forest gloom by a thick growth of overhanging sycamore , elm , and eucalyptus . Ellery 's first thought was that the grounds were neglected , but then he saw evidences of both old and recent pruning on the sides away from the house and he realized that nature had2 1'HE ORIGIN OIr EVIL. been coaxed into the role she was playing . The hopeless matting of leaves and boughs was deliberate ; the secretive gloom was wanted . Priam had dug into the hill and pulled the trees over him . Who was it who had defied the sun ? It was more like an isolated hunting lodge than a Hollywood house . Most of it was hidden from the view of passers-by on the main road , and by its character it transformed a suburban section of ordinarySouthern California canyon into a wild Scottish glen . Laurel told Ellery that the Priam property extended up and along the hill for four or five acres and that it was all like the area about the house . " Jungle , " said Ellery as Laurel parked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cream Cadillac . " Well , he 's a wild animal . Like the deer you flush occasionally up behind the Bowl . " " He 's paying for the privilege . His electric bills must be enormous . " " I 'm sure they are . There is n't a sunny room in the house . When he wants  --  you ca n't say more light  --  when he wants less gloom , and air that is n't so stale , he wheels himself out on that terrace there . " To one side of the house there was a large terrace , half of it screened and roofed , the other open not to the sky but a high arch of blue gum eucalyptus leaves and branches which the sun did not penetrate . " His den  --  den is the word  --  is directly off the terrace , past those French and screen doors . We 'd better go in the front way ; Roger does n't like people barging in on his sacred preserves . In the Priam house you 're announced . " " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her house is run ? " " Who said it 's her house ? " said Laurel . A uniformed maid with a tic admitted them . " Oh , Miss Hill , " she said nervously . " I do n't think Mr. Priam ... He 's dictatin ' to Mr. Wallace . I better not ... " " Is Mrs. Priam in , Muggs ? " " She just got in from shoppin ' , Miss Hill . She 's upstairs in her room . Said she was tired and was not to be disturbed . " " Poor Delia , " said Laurel calmly . " I know Mr. Queen is terribly disappointed . Tell Mr. Priam I want to see him . " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 35 " But , Miss Hill  --  " A muffled roar of rage stopped her instantly . She glanced over her shoulder in a panic . " It 's all right , Muggsy . I 'll take the rap . Fainos , Ellery . " " I wonder why she  --  " Ellery began in a mumble as Laurel led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Delia is concerned . " The house was even grimmer than he had expected . They passed shrouded rooms with dark paneling , heavy and humorless drapes , massive uncomfortable-looking furniture . It was a house for secrets and for violence . The roar was a bass snarl now . " I do n't give a damn what Mr. Hill wanted to do about the Newman-Arco account , Foss ! Mr. Hill 's locked in a drawer in Forest Lawn and he ai n't in any condition to give us the benefit of his advice ... No , I wo n't wait a minute , Foss ! I 'm running this business , and you 'll either handle things myway or get the hell out ! " Laurel 's lips thinned . She raised her fist and hammered on the door . " Whoever that is , Alfred  --  ! Foss , you still there ? " A man opened the heavy door and slipped into the hall , pulling the door to and keeping his hand on the knob behind him . " You picked a fine time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So I hear , " said Laurel . " Mr. Queen , Mr. Wallace . His other name ought to be Job , but it 's Alfred . The perfect man , I call him . Superefficient . Discreet as all get-out . Never slips . One side , Alfred . I 've got business with my partner . " " Better let me set him up , " said Wallace with a smile . As he slipped back into the room , his eyes flicked over Ellery . Then the door was shut again , and Ellery waved his right hand tenderly . It still tingled from Wallace 's grip . " Surprised ? " murmured Laurel . Ellery was . He had expected a Milquetoast character . Instead AlfredWallace was a towering , powerfully assembled man with even , rather sharp , features , thick white hair , a tan , and an air of lean distinction . His voice was strong and thoughtful , with the merest36 THE ORIGIN OF EVILtouch of ... superiority ? Whatever it was , it was barely enough to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out of a set on the M-G-M lot labeled High Society Drawing Room ; and , in fact , " well-preserved actor " had been Ellery 's impulsive characterization  --  Hollywood leading-men types with Athletic Club tans were turning up these days in the most unexpected places , swallowing their pride in order to be able to swallow at all . But a moment later Ellery was not so sure . Wallace 's shoulders did not look as if they came off with his coat . His physique , even his elegance , seemed homegrown . " I should think you 'd be smitten , Laurel , " said Ellery as they waited . " That 's a virile character . Perfectly disciplined , and dashing as the devil . " " A little too old , " said Laurel . " For me , that is . " " He ca n't be much more than fifty-five . And he does n't look fortyfive , white hair notwithstanding . " " Alfred would be too old for me if he were twenty .  --  Oh . Well ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alfred , or is the Grand Vizier going to play gracious this morning ? " Alfred Wallace smiled and let them pass . THE MAN WHO slammed the phone down and spun the steel chair about as if it were a studio production of balsa wood was a creature of immensities . He was all bulge , spread , and thickness . Bull eyes blazed above iron cheekbones ; the nose was a massive snout ; a tremendous black beard fell to his chest . The hands which gripped the wheels of the chair were enormous ; forearms and biceps strained his coat sleeves . And the whole powerful mechanism was in continuousmovement , as if even that great frame was unable to contain his energy . Something by Wolf Larsen out of Captain Teach , on a restless quarter-deck . Besides that immense torso Alfred Wallace 's strong figure looked frail . And Ellery felt like an underfed boy . But below the waist Roger Priam was dead . His bulk sat on a withered base , an underpinning of skeletal flesh and atrophiedTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 37muscle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine the labor that went into that operation twice daily  --  but his ankles were visible , two shriveled bones , and his knees were twisted projections , like girders struck by lightning . The whole shrunken substructure of his body hung useless . It was all explicable , Ellery thought , on ordinary grounds : the torso overdeveloped by the extraordinary exertions required for the simplest movement ; the beard grown to eliminate one of the irksomeprocesses of his daily toilet ; the savage manner an expression of his hatred of the fate that had played such a trick on him ; and the restlessness a sign of the agony he endured to maintain a sitting position . Those were the reasons ; still , they left something unexplained ... Ferocity  --  fierce strength , fierce emotions , fierce reaction to pain and people  --  ferocity seemed his center . Take everythingelse away , and Ellery suspected it would still be there . He must have been fierce in his mother 's womb , a wild beast by nature . What had happened to him merely brought it into play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " His voice was a coarse , threatening bass , rumbling up from his chest like live lava . He was still furious from his telephone conversation with the hapless Foss ; his eyes were filled with hate . " What are you looking at ? Why do n't you open your mouth ? " " This is Ellery Queen . " " Who ? " Laurel repeated it . " Never heard of him . What 's he want ? " The feral glance turned on Ellery . " What d'ye want ? Hey ? " " Mr. Priam , " said the beautiful voice of Alfred Wallace from the doorway , " Ellery Queen is a famous writer . " " Writer ? " " And detective , Mr. Priam . " Priam 's lips pushed out , dragging his beard forward . The great hands on the wheel became clamps . " I told you I was n't going to let go , Roger , " said Laurel evenly . " My father was murdered . There must have been a reason . And38 THE ORIGIN OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as Daddy . I 've asked Ellery Queen to investigate , and he wants to talk to you . " " He does , does he ? " The rumble was distant ; the fiery eyes gave out heat . " Go ahead , Mister . Talk away . " " In the first place , Mr. Priam , " said Ellery , " I 'd like to know  --  " " The answer is no , " said Roger Priam , his teeth showing through his beard . " What 's in the second place ? " " Mr. Priam , " Ellery began again , patiently . " No good , Mister . I do n't like your questions . Now you listen to me , Laurel . " His right fist crashed on the arm of the chair . " You 're a damn busybody . This ai n't your business . It 's mine . I 'll tend to it . I 'll do it my way , and I 'll do it myself . Can you get that through your head ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Priam half-raised his bulk , his eyes boiling . The lava burst with a roar . " Me afraid ? Afraid of what ? A ghost ? What d'ye think I am , another Leander Hill ? The snivelin ' dirt ! Shaking in his shoes  --  looking over his shoulder  --  creeping on his face ! He was born a  --  yellowbelly , and he died the same  --  " Laurel hit him on the cheek with her fist . His left arm came up impatiently and brushed her aside . She staggered backward halfway across the room into Alfred Wallace 's arms . " Let go of me , " she whispered . " Let go ! " " Laurel , " said Ellery . She stopped , breathing from her diaphragm . Wallace silently releasedher . Laurel walked out of the room . " Afraid ! " A spot swelled on Priam 's cheekbone . " You think so ? " he bellowed after her . " Well , a certain somebody 's gon na find out that my pump do n't go to pieces at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for the goddam ! Any hour of the day or night , understand ? Any time he wants to show his scummy hand ! He 'll find out I got a pretty good pair myself ! " And he opened and closed his murderous hands , and Ellery thought again of Wolf Larsen . " Roger . What 's the matter ? " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 39And there she was in the doorway . She had changed to a hostess gown of golden silk which clung as if it loved her . It was slit to the knee . She was glancing coolly from her husband to Ellery . Wallace 's eyes were on her . They seemed amused . " Who is this man ? " " Nobody . Nothing , Delia . It do n't concern you . " Priam glared at Ellery . " You . Get out ! . " She had come downstairs just to establish the fact that she did n't know him . As a point in character , it should have interested him . Instead , it annoyed him . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he to Hecuba ? Although she was making clear enough what Hecubawas to him . He felt chagrined and challenged , and at the same time he wondered if she affected other men the same way ... Wallace was enjoying himself discreetly , like a playgoer who has caught a point which escaped the rest of the audience and is too polite to laugh aloud ... Her attitude toward her husband was calm , without fear or any other visible emotion . " What are you waiting for ? You ai n't wanted , Mister . Get out ! " " I 've been trying to make up my mind , Mr. Priam , " said Ellery , " whether you 're a bag of wind or a damned fool . " Priam 's bearded lips did a little dance . His rage , apparently always in shallow water , was surfacing again . Ellery braced himself for the splash . Priam was afraid . Wallace  --  silent , amused , attentive Wallace  --  Wallace saw it . And Delia Priam saw it ; she was smiling . " Alfred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Ellery looked down at his arm . Wallace 's hand was on it . " I 'm afraid , Mr. Queen , " murmured Wallace , " that I 'm man enough to do it , too . " The man 's grip was paralyzing . Priam was grinning , a yellow hairy grin that jarred him . And the woman  --  that animate piece of jungle  --  watching . To his amazement , Ellery felt himself going blind-mad . When he came to , Alfred Wallace was sitting on the floor chafing his wrist and staring up at Ellery . He did not seem angry ; just surprised . " That 's a good trick , " Wallace said . " I 'll remember it . " 40 THE ORIGIN OF EVILEllery fumbled for a cigaret , decided against it . " I 've made up my mind , Mr. Priam . You 're a bag of wind and a damned fool .

And the gape on Priam 's ugly face . Probably set her up for the week .. . He found himself searching for her out of the corners of his eyes as he strode down the hall .

Slit to the kneel That one was older than the pyramids . And how old was his stupidity ? It probably went back to the primordial slime . Then he remembered that Delia Priam was a lady and that he was behaving exactly like a frustrated college boy , and he slammed the front door . LAUREL WAS WAITING for him in the Austin . She was still white ; smoking with energy . Ellery jumped in beside her and growled , " Well , what are we waiting for ?

" " But we found out something , " she said eagerly . " He admitted it . You heard him . A ghost , ' he said . A certain somebody '  --  I heard that on my way out . I was n't being delirious , Ellery . Roger thinks Daddy was deliberately shocked to death , too . And , what 's more , he knows what the dog meant  --  " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 41 " Not necessarily , " grunted Ellery . " That 's the trouble with you amateurs . Always jumping to conclusions .

" But they 're a bit obvious , do n't you think ? " He was trying not to look up at the secondstorywindows , where her bedroom undoubtedly was . " Laurel , we ca n't park here in the driveway like a couple of adenoidal tourists  --  " He had to see her again . Just to see her . Laurel gave him an odd look and drove off . She turned left at the road , driving slowly . Ellery sat embracing his knees . He had the emptiest feeling that he was losing something with each spin of the Austin 's wheels . And there was Laurel , seeing the road ahead and something else , too . Sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Ellery suddenly felt himself weakening . " What do you intend to do , Laurel ? " " Keep poking around . " " You 're determined to go through with this ? " " Do n't feel sorry for me . I 'll make out . " " Laurel , I 'll tell you what I 'll do . " She looked at him . " I 'll go as far as that note with you  --  I mean , give you a head start , anyway . If , of course , it 's possible . " " What are you talking about ? " She stopped the car with a bump . " The note your father found in that silver box on the dog 's collar . You thought he must have destroyed it . " " I told you I looked for it and it was n't there . " " Suppose I do the looking . " Laurel stared . Then she laughed and the Austin jumped . The Hill house spread itself high on one of the canyon walls , cheer-42 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a two-story Spanish house , beautifully bleached , with black wrought-iron tracery , arched and balconied and patioed and covered with pyracantha . It was set in two acres of flowers , flowering shrubs , and trees  --  palm and fruit and nut and bird-of-paradise . Around the lower perimeter ran the woods . " Our property line runs down the hill , " Laurel said as they got out of the car , " over towards the Priams ' . A little over nine additional acres meeting the Priam woods . Through the woods it 's no distance at all . " " It 's a very great distance , " mumbled Ellery . " About as far as from an eagle 's nest to an undersea cave . True Spanish , I notice , like the missions , not the modern fakes so common out here . It must be a punishment to Delia Priam  --  born to this and condemned to that . " " Oh , she 's told you about that , " murmured Laurel ; then she took him into her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the touch of iron . There was a sunken living room forty feet long , a great fireplace set with Goya tiles , books and music and paintings and ceramics and huge jars of flowers everywhere . A tall Japanese in a white jacket came in smiling and took Ellery 's hat . " Ichiro Sotowa , " said Laurel . " Itchie 's been with us for ages . This is Mr. Queen , Itchie . He 's interested in the way Daddy died , too . " The houseman 's smile faded . " Bad  --  bad , " he said , shaking his head . " Heart no good . You like a drink , sir ? " " Not just now , thanks , " said Ellery . " Just how long did you work for Mr. Hill , Ichiro ? " " Sixteen year , sir . " " Oh , then you do n't go back to the time of . . . What about that chauffeur  --  Simeon , was it ? " " Shimmie shopping with Mis ' Monk . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About ten years , " said Laurel . " Mrs. Monk came around the same time . " " That 's that , then . All right , Laurel , let 's begin . " " Where ? " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 43 " From the time your father had his last heart attack  --  the day the dog came  --  until his death , did he leave his bedroom ? " " No . Itchie and I took turns nursing him . Night and day the entire week . " " Bedroom indicated . Lead the way . " AN HOUR AND a half later , Ellery opened the door of Leander Hill 's room . Laurel was curled up in a window niche on the landing , head resting against the wall . " I suppose you think I 'm an awful sissy , " she said , without turning . " But all I can see when I 'm in there is his marbly face and blue lips and the crooked way his mouth hung open . . . not my daddy at all . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She jerked about . Then she jumped off the ledge and ran to him . Ellery shut the bedroom door . Laurel 's eyes hunted wildly . But aside from the four-poster bed , which was disarranged , she could see nothing unusual . The spread , sheets , and quilt were peeled back , revealing the side walls of the box spring and mattress . " What  --  ? " " The note you saw him remove from the dog 's collar , " Ellery said . " It was on thin paper , did n't you tell me ? " " Very . A sort of flimsy , or onionskin . " " White ? " " White . " Ellery nodded . He went over to the exposed mattress . " He was in this room for a week , Laurel , between his attack and death . During that week did he have many visitors ? " " The Priam household . Some people from the office . A few friends . " " Some time during that week , " said Ellery , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in danger of being stolen or destroyed . So he took out insurance . " His finger traced on the side wall of the mattress one of the perpendicular blue lines of the ticking . " He had no tool but a dull penknife from the night table there . And I suppose he was in a hurry , afraid he might be caught at it . So the job44 THE ORIGIN OF EVILhad to be crude . " Half his finger suddenly vanished . " He simply made a slit here , where the blue line meets the undyed ticking . And he slipped the paper into it , where I found it . " " The note , " breathed Laurel . " You 've found the note . Let me see ! " Ellery put his hand in his pocket . But just as he was about to withdrawit , he stopped . His eyes were on one of the windows . Some ten yards away there was an old walnut tree . " Yes ? " Laurel was confused . " What 's the matter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if you can , and then stroll overto the door . Go out on the landing . Leave the door open . " Her eyes widened . She got off the bed , yawned , stretched , showed her teeth , and wentto the door . Ellery moved a little as she moved , so that he remained between her and the window . When she had disappeared , he casually followed . Smiling in profile at her , he shut the bedroom door . And sprang for the staircase . " Ellery  --  " " Stay here ! " He scrambled down the black-tiled stairs , leaving Laurel with her lips parted . A man had been roosting high in the walnut tree , peering in at them through Leander Hill 's bedroom window from behind a screenof leaves . But the sun had been on the tree , and Ellery could have sworn the fellow was mother-naked . THE NAKED MAN was gone . Ellery thrashed about among the fruit and nut trees feeling like Robinson Crusoe . From the flagged piazza Ichiro gaped at him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cap , carrying a carton of groceries , was gaping with him . Ellery found a large footprint at the margin of the orchard , splayed and deeptoed , indicating running or jumping , and it pointed directly to the woods . He darted into the underbrush and in a moment he was nosing past trees and scrub on a twisting but clear trail . There were numerous specimens of the naked print on the trail , both coming andgoing . " He 's made a habit of this , " Ellery mumbled . It was hot in the woods and he was soon drenched , uncomfortable , and out of temper . The trail ended unceremoniously in the middle of a clearing . No other footprints anywhere . The trunk of the nearest tree , an ancient , oakish-looking monster , was yards away . There were no vines . Ellery looked around , swabbing his neck . Then he looked up . The giant limbs of the tree covered the clearing with a thick fabric of small spiny leaves , but the lowest branch was thirty feet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taken off . Ellery sat down on a corrupting log and wiped his face , reflecting on this latest wonder . Not that anything in Southern California ever really surprised him . But this was a little out of even God 's country 's class . Flying nudes ! " Lost ? " Ellery leaped . A little old man in khaki shorts , woolen socks , and a46 THE ORIGIN OF EVILT-shirt was smiling at him from a bush . He wore a paper topee on his head and he carried a butterfly net ; a bright red case of some sort was slung over one skinny shoulder . His skin was a shriveled brown and his hands were like the bark of the big tree , but his eyes were a bright young blue and they seemed keen . " I 'm not lost , " said Ellery irritably . " I 'm looking for a man . " " I do n't like the way you say that , " said the old man , stepping into the clearing . " You 're on the wrong track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Lepidoptera ? " " Not a thing . Have you seen  --  ? " " You catch ' em with this dingbat . I just bought the kit yesterday  --  passed a toy shop on Hollywood Boulevard and there it was , all new and shiny , in the window . I 've caught four beauties so far . " The butterfly hunter began to trot down the trail , waving his net menacingly . " Wait ! Have you seen anyone running through these woods ? " " Running ? Well , now , depends . " " Depends ? My dear sir , it does n't depend on a thing ! Either you saw somebody or you did n't . " " Not necessarily , " replied the little man earnestly , trotting back . " It depends on whether it 's going to get him  --  or you  --  in trouble . There 's too much trouble in this world , young man . What 's this runner look like ? " " I ca n't give you a description , " snapped Ellery , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to . Or rather , I saw the wrong parts .  --  Hell . He 's naked . " " Ah , " said the hunter , making an unsuccessful pass at a large , paintsplashedbutterfly . " Naked , hm ? " " And there was a lot of him . " " There was . You would n't start any trouble ? " " No , no , I wo n't hurt him . Just tell me which way he went . " " I 'm not worried about your hurting him . He 's much more likely to hurt you . Powerful build , that boy . Once knew a stoker built like him  --  could bend a coal shovel . That was in the old Susie Belle , beatingup to Alaska  --  " " You sound as if you know him . " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 47 " Know him ? I darned well ought to . He 's my grandson . There he is ! " cried the hunter . " Where ? " But it was only the fifth butterfly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . Ellery was morosely studying the last footprint in the trail when Laurel poked her head cautiously into the clearing . " There you are , " she said with relief . " You scared the buttermilk out of me . What happened ? " " Character spying on us from the walnut tree outside the bedroom window . I trailed him here  --  " " What did he look like ? " frowned Laurel . " No clothes on . " " Why , the lying mugwump ! " she said angrily . " He promised on his honor he would n't do that any more . It 's got so I have to undress in the dark . " " So you know him , too , " growled Ellery . " I thought California had a drive on these sex cases . " " Oh , he 's no sex case . He just throws gravel at my window and tries to get me to talk drool to him . I ca n't waste my time on somebody who 's preparing for Armageddon at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Whose grandson is he ? " " Grandson ? Mr. Collier 's . " " Mr. Collier would n't be a little skinny old gent with a face like a sun-dried fig ? " " That 's right . " " And just who is Mr. Collier ? " " Delia Priam 's father . He lives with the Priams . " " Her father . " You could n't keep her out of anything . " But if this Peeping Tom is Delia Priam 's father 's grandson , then he must be  --  " " Did n't Delia tell you , " asked Laurel with a soupcon of malice , " that she has a twenty-three year old son ? His name is Crowe Macgowan . Delia 's child by her first husband . Roger 's stepson . But let 's not waste any time on him  --  " 48 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " How does he disappear into thin air ? He pulled that miracle right here . " " Oh , that . " Laurel looked straight up . So Ellery looked straight up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leafy ceiling where the great oak branched ten yards over his head . " Mac ! " said Laurel sharply . " Show your face . " To Ellery 's amazement , a large young male face appeared in the middle of the green mass thirty feet from the ground . On the face there was a formidable scowl . " Laurel , who is this guy ? " " You come down here . " " Is he a reporter ? " " Heavens , no , " said Laurel disgustedly . " He 's Ellery Queen . " " Who ? " " Ellery Queen . " " You 're kidding ! " " I would n't have time . " " Say . I 'll be right down . " The face vanished . At once something materialized where it had been and hurtled to the ground , missing Ellery 's nose by inches . It was a rope ladder . A massive male leg broke the green ceiling , then another , then a whole young man , and in a moment the tree man was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of naked footprints ended . " I 'm certainly thrilled to meet you ! " Ellery 's hand was seized and the bones broken before he could cry out . At least , they felt broken . It was a bad day for the Master 's selfrespect : he could not decide which had the most powerful hands , Roger Priam , Alfred Wallace , or the awesome brute trying to pulverizehim . Delia 's son towered six inches above him , a handsome giant with an impossible spread of shoulder , an unbelievable minimum of waist , the muscular development of Mr. America , the skin of a Hawaiian  --  all of which was on view except a negligible area covered by a brown loincloth  --  and a grin that made Ellery feel positivelyaged . " I thought you were a newshound , Mr. Queen . Ca n't stand thoseTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 49guys  --  they 've made my life miserable . But what are we standing here for ? Come on up to the house . " " Some other time , Mac , " said Laurel coldly , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do n't you relax , Laur ? " " I do n't think I 'd be exactly welcome at your stepfather 's , Mac , " said Ellery . " You 've already had the pleasure ? But I meant come up to my house . " " He really means up , ' Ellery , " sighed Laurel . " All right , let 's get it over with . You would n't believe it secondhand . " " House ? Up ? " Feebly Ellery glanced aloft ; and to his horror the young giant nodded and sprang up the rope ladder , beckoning them hospitably to follow . IT REALLY WAS a house , high in the tree . A one-room house , to be sure , and not commodious , but it had four walls and a thatched roof , a sound floor , a beamed ceiling , two windows , and a platform from which the ladder dangled  --  this dangerous-looking perch young Macgowan referred to cheerfully as his " porch , " and perfectly safe if you did n't fall off . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a bole circumferenceof eighteen feet , and " watch those leaves , Mr. Queen , they bite . " Ellery , who was gingerly digging several of the spiny little devils out of his shirt , nodded sourly . But the structure was built on a foundation of foot-thick boughs and seemed solid enough underfoot . He poked his head indoors at his host 's invitation and gaped like a tourist . Every foot of wall- and floor-space was occupied by  --  it was the only phrase Ellery could muster  --  aids to tree-living . " Sorry I ca n't entertain you inside , " said the young man , " but three of us would bug it out a bit . We 'd better sit on the porch . Anybody like a drink ? Bourbon ? Scotch ? " Without waiting for a reply Macgowanbent double and slithered into his house . Various liquid sounds followed . " Laurel , why do n't they put the poor kid away ? " whispered Ellery . " You have to have grounds . " " What do you call this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " Do n't blame you , Mr. Queen , " said the big fellow amiably , appearingwith two chilled glasses . " Appearances are against me . But that 's because you people live in a world of fantasy . " He thrust a long arm into the house and it came out with another glass . " Fantasy . We . " Ellery gulped a third of the contents of his glass . " You , of course , live in a world of reality ? " " Do we have to ? " asked Laurel wearily . " If he gets started on this , Ellery , we 'll be here till sundown . That note  --  " " I 'm the only realist I know , " said the giant , lying down at the edge of his porch and kicking his powerful legs in space . " Because , look . What are you people doing ? Living in the same old houses , reading the same old newspapers , going to the same old movies or looking at the same old television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same old new cars . That 's a dream world , do n't you realize it ? What price business-as-usual ? What price , well , sky-writing , Jacques Fath , Double-Crostics , murder ? Do you get my point ? " " Ca n't say it 's entirely clear , Mac , " said Ellery , swallowing the second third . He realized for the first time that his glass contained bourbon , which he loathed . However . " We are living , " said young Mr. Macgowan , " in the crisis of the disease commonly called human history . You mess around with your piddling murders while mankind is being set up for the biggest homicidesince the Flood . The atom bomb is already fuddy-duddy . Now it 's hydrogen bombs , guaranteed to make the nuclear chain reaction  --  or whatever the hell it is  --  look like a Fourth of July firecracker . Stuff that can poison all the drinking water on a continent . Nerve gases that paralyze and kill . Germs there 's no protection against . And only God knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those words constitute the epitaph of Man . Somebody 'll pull the cork in a place like Yugoslavia or Iran or Korea and , whoosh ! that 'll be that . " It 's all going to go , " said Macgowan , waving his glass at the invisibleworld below . " Cities uninhabitable. , Crop soil poisoned for a hundred years . Domestic animals going wild . Insects multiplying . Balance of nature upset . Ruins and plagues and millions of square miles radioactive and maybe most of the earth 's atmosphere . The roads crack , the lines sag , the machines rust , the libraries mildew , the THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 51buzzards fatten , and the forest primeval creeps over Hollywood and Vine , which maybe is n't such a bad idea . But there you 'll have it . Thirty thousand years of primate development knocked over like a sleeping duck . Civilization atomized and annihilated . Yes , there 'll be some survivors  --  I 'm going to be one of them . But what are we going to have to do ? Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees . That 's logic , is n't it ? So here I am . All ready for it . " " Now let 's have the note , " said Laurel . " In a moment . " Ellery polished off the last third , shuddering . " Very logical , Mac , except for one or two items . " " Such as ? " said Crowe Macgowan courteously . " Here , let me give you a refill . " " No , thanks , not just now . Why , such as these . " Ellery pointed to a network of cables winging from some hidden spot to the roof of Macgowan 's tree house . " For a chap who 's written off thirty thousand years of primate development you do n't seem to mind tapping the main power line for such things as  --  " he craned , surveying the interior  --  " electric lights , a small electric range and refrigerator , and similar primitive devices ; not to mention  --  " he indicated a maze of pipes  --  " running water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a septic tank buried somewhere below , and so on . These things  --  forgive me , Mac  --  blow bugs through your logic . The only essential differences between your house and your stepfather 's are that yours is smaller and thirty feet in the air . " " Just being practical , " shrugged the giant . " It 's my opinion it 'll happen any day now . But I can be wrong  --  it may not come till next year . I 'm just taking advantage of the civilized comforts while they 're still available . But you 'll notice I have a .22 rifle hanging there , a couple of .45s , and when my ammunition runs out or I ca n't rustle any more there 's a bow that 'll bring down any deer that survives the party . I practice daily . And I 'm getting pretty good running around these treetops  --  " " Which reminds me , " said Laurel . " Use your own trees after this , will you , Mac ? I 'm no prude , but a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Macgowan , " said Ellery , eying their host , " what 's the pitch ? " 52 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " Pitch ? I 've just told you . " " I know what you 've just told me , and it 's already out the other ear . What character are you playing ? And in what script by whom ? " Ellery set the glass down and got to his feet . The effect he was trying to achieve was slightly spoiled , as he almost fell off the porch . He jumped to the side of the house , a little green . " I 've been to Hollywood before . " " Go ahead and sneer , " said the brown giant without rancor . " I promise to give you a decent burial if I can find the component parts . " Ellery eyed the wide back for a moment . It was perfectly calm . He shrugged . Every time he came to Hollywood something fantastic happened . This was the screwiest yet . He was well out of it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put his hand in his pocket . " Laurel , " he said meaningly , " shall we go ? " " If it 's about that piece of paper I saw you find in Leander 's mattress , " said young Macgowan , " I would n't mind knowing myself what 's in it . " " It 's all right , Ellery , " said Laurel with an exasperated laugh . " Crowe is a lot more interested in the petty affairs of us dreamers than he lets on . And in a perverted sort of way I trust him . May I please see that note ? " " IT IS N'T THE note you saw your father take from the collar of the dog , " said Ellery , eying Macgowan disapprovingly as he took a sheet of paper from his pocket . " It 's a copy . The original is gone . " The sheet was folded over once . He unfolded it . It was a stiff vellum paper , tinted green-gray , with an embossed green monogram . " Daddy 's personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also found this bi-colored pencil . " Ellery fished an automatic pencil from his pocket . " The blue lead is snapped . The note starts in blue and ends in red . Evidently the blue ran out halfway through his copying and he finished writing with the red . So the pencil places the copying in his bedroom , too . " Ellery held out the sheet . " Is this your father 's handwriting ? " " Yes . " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 53 " No doubt about it ? " " No . " In a rather peculiar voice , Ellery said , " All right , Laurel . Read it . " " But it 's not signed . " Laurel sounded as if she wanted to punch somebody . " Read it . " Macgowan knelt behind her , nuzzling her shoulder with his big chin . Laurel paid no attention to him ; she read the note with a set face . You believed me dead . Killed , murdered . For over a score of years I have looked for you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found you . Can you guess my plan ? You 'll die . Quickly ? No , very slowly . And so pay me back for my long years of searching and dreaming of revenge . Slow dying . . . unavoidable dying . For you and for him . Slow and sure  --  dying in mind and in body . And for each pace forward a warning . . . a warning of special meaning for you  --  and for him . Meanings for pondering and puzzling . Here is warning number one . Laurel stared at the notepaper . " That , " said Crowe Macgowan , taking the sheet , " is the unfunniest gag of the century . " He frowned over it . " Not just that . " Laurel shook her head . " Warning number one . Murder . Revenge . Special meanings . . . It  --  it has a long curly mustache on it . Next week Uncle Tom 's Cabin . " She looked around with a laugh . " Even in Hollywood . " " Why 'd the old scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously . Ellery took the sheet from him and folded it carefully . " Melodrama is a matter of atmosphere and expression . Pick up any Los Angeles newspaper and you 'll find three news stories running serially , any one of which would make this one look like a work by Einstein . But they 're real because they 're couched in everyday terms . What makes this note incredible is not the contents . It 's the wording . " " The wording ? " " It 's painful . Actually archaic in spots . As if it were composed by someone who wears a ruff , or a tricorn . Someone who speaks a differ-54 THE ORIGIN OF EVILent kind of English . Or writes it . It has a . . . bouquet , an archive smell . A something that would never have been put into it purely for deception , for instance . . . like the ransom note writers who deliber- ately misspell words and mix their tenses to give the impression of illiteracy . And yet  --  I do n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the strangest mixture of genuineness and contrivance . I do n't understand it . " " Maybe , " suggested the young man , putting his arm carelessly around Laurel 's shoulders , " maybe it 's the work of some psycho foreigner . It reads like somebody translating from another lan- guage . " " Possible . " Ellery sucked his lower lip . Then he shrugged . " Any- way , Laurel , there 's something to go on . Are you sure you would n't rather discuss this  --  ? " " You mean because it involves Roger ? " Laurel laughed again , re- moving Macgowan 's paw . " Mac is n't one of Roger 's more ardent admirers , Ellery . It 's all right . " " What did he do now ? " growled Roger Priam 's stepson . " He said he was n't going to be scared by any ghost , ' Mac . Or rather roared it . And here 's a clue to someone from his past and , apparently , Leander Hill 's . For you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know of your father 's background ? " " Not much . He 'd led an adventurous life , I think , but whenever I used to ask him questions about it  --  especially when I was little  --  he 'd laugh , slap me on the bottom , and send me off to Mad'moiselle . " " What about his family ? " " Family ? " said Laurel vaguely . " Brothers , sisters , uncle , cousins  --  family . Where did he come from ? Laurel , I 'm fishing . We need some facts . " " I 'm no help there . Daddy never talked about himself . I always felt I could n't pry . I ca n't remember his ever having any contact with relatives . I do n't even know if any exist . " " When did he and Priam go into business together ? " " It must have been around twenty , twenty-five years ago . " " Before Delia and he got married , " said Crowe . " Delia  --  that 's my mother , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " said Ellery , a bit stiffly . " Had Priam and Hill known each other well before they started the jewelry business , Macgowan ? " " I do n't know . " The giant put his arm about Laurel 's waist . " I suppose they did . They must have , " Laurel said in a helpless way , absently removing the arm . " I realize now how little I know about Dad 's past . " " Or I about Roger 's , " said Crowe , marching two fingers up Laurel 's back . She wriggled and said , " Oh , stop it , Mac . " He got up . " Neither of them ever talked about it . " He went over to the other end of the platform and stretched out again . " Apparently with reason . Leander Hill and Roger Priam had a common enemy in the old days , someone they thought was dead . He says they tried to put him out of the way , and he 's spent over twenty years tracking them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crowe Macgowan 's arms . " Dad tried to murder somebody ? " Laurel bit her thumb . " When you yell bloody murder , Laurel , " said Ellery , " you 've got to be prepared for a certain echo of nastiness . This kind of murder , " he said , lighting a cigaret and placing it between her lips , " is never nice . It 's usually rooted in pretty mucky soil . Priam means nothing to you , and your father is dead . Do you still want to go through with this ? You 're my client , you know , not Mrs. Priam . At her own sug-gestion . " " Did Mother come to you ? " exclaimed Macgowan . " Yes , but we 're keeping it confidential . " " I did n't know she cared , " muttered the giant . Ellery lit a cigaret for himself . Laurel was wrinkling her nose and looking a little sick . Ellery tossed the match overside . " Whoever composed that note is on a delayed murder spree . He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . A quick killing does n't suit him at all . He wants the men who injured him to suffer , presumably , as he 's suffered . To accomplish this he starts a private war of nerves . His strategy is all plotted . Working from the dark , he makes his first tactical move . . . the warning , the first of the special meanings ' he promises . Number one is  --  of all things  --  a dead pooch , number two56 THE ORIGIN OF EVILwhatever was in the box to Roger Priam  --  I wonder what it was , by the way ! You would n't know , Mac , would you ? " " I would n't know anything about my mother 's husband , " replied Macgowan . " And he means to send other warnings with other gifts ' which have special meanings . To Priam exclusively now  --  Hill foxed him by dying at once . He 's a man with a fixed idea , Laurel , and an obsessive sense of injury . I really think you ought to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's his skin , and if he needs help he knows where he can apply for it . " Laurel threw herself back on the platform , blowing smoke to the appliqued sky . " Do n't you feel you have to act like the heroine of a magazine serial ? " Laurel did not reply . " Laurel , drop it . Now . " She rolled her head . " I do n't care what Daddy did . People make mistakes , even commit crimes , who are decent and nice . Sometimes events force you , or other people . I knew him  --  as a human being  --  better than anyone in creation . If he and Roger Priam got into a mess , it was Roger who thought up the dirty work . . . The fact that he was n't my real father makes it even more important . I owe him everything .

" " Tough she may be , my Tarzanian friend , " grumbled Ellery , " but this sort of thing is a business , not an endurance contest . It takes knowhowand connections and a technique . And experience . None of which Miss Strongheart has . " He crushed his cigaret out on the platform vindictively . " Not to mention the personal danger . . . Well , I 'll root around a little , Laurel . Do some checking back . It should n't be too much of a job to get a line on those two and find out what they were up to in the Twenties . And who got caught in the meat-grinder . . . You driving me back to the world of fantasy ? " THE NEXT MORNING Ellery called the Los Angeles Police Department and asked to speak to the officer in charge of the Public Relations Department . " Sergeant Lordetti . " " Sergeant , this is Ellery Queen . . . Yes , how do you do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel  --  oh , you 've seen that .. . no , I ca n't make the newspapers believe it and , frankly , I 've given up trying . Sergeant Lordetti , I need some expert advice for background on my book . Is there anyone in , say , the Hollywood Division who could give me a couple hours of his time ? Some trouble-shooter with lots of experience in murder investigation and enough drag in the Department so I could call on him from time to time ? . . . Expose ? So you fell for that , too , haha ! Me , the son of a cop ? No , no , Sergeant , nothing like that , believe me . . . Who ? . . . K-e-a-t-s . Thanks a lot . . . Not at all , Sergeant . If you can make a little item out of it , you 're entirely welcome . " Ellery called the Hollywood Division on Wilcox below Sunset and asked to speak to Lieutenant Keats . Informed that Lieutenant Keats was on another phone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call back as soon as he was free . Twenty minutes later a car drew up to his house and a big lean man in a comfortable-looking business suit got out and rang the bell , glancingaround at Ellery 's pint-sized garden curiously . Hiding behind a drape , Ellery decided he was not a salesman , for he carried nothing and his interest had something amused in it . Possibly a reporter , although he seemed too carefully dressed for that . He might have been a sports announcer or a veteran airline pilot off duty. 58 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL . " It 's a policeman , Mr. Queen , " reported Mrs. Williams nervously . " You done something ? " " I 'll keep you out of it , Mrs. Williams . Lieutenant Keats ? The service staggers me .

That was for the benefit of the Mirror and News . What 's really on your mind ? " Ellery stared . Then they both grinned , shook hands , and sat down like old friends . Keats was a sandy-haired man of thirty-eight or forty with clear , rather distant gray eyes below reddish brows . His hands were big and well-kept , with a reliable look to them ; there was a gold band on the fourth finger of the left . His eyes were intelligent and his jaw had been developed by adversity . His manner was slightly standoffish . A smart cop , Ellery decided , and a rugged one . " Let me light that for you , Lieutenant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shredded cigaret from between his lips . It was unlit . " I 'm a dry smoker , Mr. Queen . Given up smoking . " He put the ruin on an ashtray and fingered a fresh cigaret , settling back . " Some case you 're interested in ? Something you do n't want to get around ? " " It came my way yesterday morning . Do you know anything about the death of a wholesale jeweler named Leander Hill ? " " So she got to you . " Keats lipped the unlit cigaret . " It passed through our Division . The girl made a pest of herself . Something about a dead dog and a note that scared her father to death . But no note . An awfully fancy yarn . More in your line than ours . " Ellery handed Keats the sheet of Leander Hill 's stationery . Keats read it slowly . Then he examined the notepaper , front and back .

" " Even if this were the McCoy . " Keats put the sheet down . " There 's nothing here that legally connects Hill 's death with a murder plot . Of course , the revenge business ... " " I know , Lieutenant . It 's the kind of case that gives you fellows a hard ache . Every indication of a psycho , and a possible victim who wo n't co-operate . " " Who 's that ? " " The him ' of the note . " Ellery told Keats about Roger Priam 's mysterious box , and of what Priam had let slip during Ellery 's visit . " There 's something more than a gangrenous imagination behind this , Lieutenant . Even though no one 's going to get anywhere with Priam , still . . . it ought to be looked into , do n't you agree ?

It seemed to me that if we could find something in Hill 's past , and Priam 's , that takes this note out of the ordinary crackpot class ... " " On the q.t. ? " " Yes . Could you swing it ? " For a moment Keats did not reply . He picked up the note and read it over again . " I 'd like to have this . " " Of course . But I want it back . " " I 'll have it photostated . Tell you what I 'll do , Mr. Queen . " LieutenantKeats rose . " I 'll talk to the Chief and if he thinks it 's worth my time , I 'll see what I can dig up . " " Oh , Keats . " " Yes , sir ?

" Out detecting , or whatever it is detectives do . " " I have n't taken the case . " He was careful to keep his voice goodhumored . " I have n't made up my mind . " " You 're angry with me about yesterday . " " Angry ? Mrs. Priam ! " " Sorry . I thought you were . " Oh , were you ? " I 'm afraid I 'm allergic to messes . I usually take the line of least resistance . " " In everything ? " " Give me an example . " Her laugh was soft .

He was so annoyed with himself that he went upstairs and took a shower . LAUREL HILL DROPPED in on him twice in the next twenty-four hours . The first time she was " just passing by " and thought she would report that nothing was happening , nothing at all . Priam would n't see her and as far as she could tell he was being his old bullying , beastly self .

" " If you do n't want to bother , say so and I 'll get someone else . " " That 's always the alternative , of course . " " But you 're just sitting here ! " " I 'm making a few preliminary inquiries , " he said patiently . " From this  --  this ivory tower ? " " Stucco . What I 'll do , Laurel , depends entirely on what I find out .

Mr. Priam , it appeared , after ousting reporters had issued a brief statement through his secretary , Alfred Wallace , repeating his denial and adding that the cause of Hill 's death was " a matter of official record . " Detectives at the Hollywood Division of the L.A.P.D. admitted this morning that Hill 's daughter , Laurel , had charged her father was " frightened to death , " but said that they had found no evidence to support the charge , which they termed " fantastic . " Miss Hill , interviewed at her home adjoining the Priam property , said : " If Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's his head . " She intimated that she " had reason to believe " both her father and Priam were slated to be murdered " by some enemy out of their past . " The story concluded with the reminder that " Mr. Priam is the stepfatherof twenty-three year old Crowe Macgowan , the Atomic Age Tree Boy , who broke into print in a big way recently by taking off his clothes and bedding down in a tree house on his stepfather 's estate in preparation for the end of the world . " Observing to himself that Los Angeles journalism was continuing to maintain its usual standards , Ellery went to the phone and called the Hill home . " Laurel ? I did n't expect you 'd be answering the phone in person this morning . " " I 've got nothing to hide . " Laurel laid the slightest stress on her pronoun . Also , she was cold , very cold . " One question . Did you tip off the papers about Priam ? " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 63 " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said no !

" Thanks , Mrs. W , I 'll do the rest . . . Not knowing exactly what is leaking where , Keats , I decided not to risk a phone call . So far I 've been kept out of it . " " Then you did n't feed the kitty ? " asked Keats . " Thanks . No cream or sugar . " " Of course not . I was wondering if it was you . " " Not me . Must have been the Hill girl . " " Not she .

" You know , Mr. Queen , " he said , scowling at his cigaret , " if there 's anything to this thing , that tip might have come . . . I know it sounds screwy ... " " From the writer of the note ? I 've been dandling that notion myself , Lieutenant . " " Pressure , say . " " In the war on Priam 's nerves . " " If he 's got an iron nerve himself . " Keats rose .

" LATE THAT AFTERNOON  --  it was the twenty-first , the day after the Shriners parade  --  Ellery looked around from his typewriter to see the creamy nose of Delia Priam 's convertible in profile against his front window . He deliberately forced himself to wait until Mrs. Williams answered the door . As he ran his hand over his hair , Mrs. Williams said : " It 's a naked man . You in ? " Macgowan was alone . He was in his Tree Boy costume  --  one loincloth , flame-colored this time . He shook Ellery 's hand limply and accepted a Scotch on the Rocks , settling himself on the sofa with his bare heels on the sill of the picture window . " I thought I recognized the car , " said Ellery . " It 's my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The giant glanced at the typewriter . " How do you knock that stuff out ? But I had to see you . " He seemed uneasy . " What about , Mac ? " " Well . . . I thought maybe the reason you had n't made up your mind to take the case was that there was n't enough money in it for you . " " Did you ? " " Look . Maybe I could put enough more in the pot to make it worth your while . " " You mean you want to hire me , too , Mac ? " " That 's it . " He seemed relieved that it was out . " I got to thinking ... that note , and then whatever it was Roger got in that box the morning old man Hill got the dead dog ... I mean , maybe there 's something in it after all , Mr. Queen . " " Suppose there is . " Ellery studied him with curiosity . " Why are you interested enough to want to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's husband , is n't he ? " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 65 " Touching , Mac . When did you two fall in love ? " Young Macgowan 's brown skin turned mahogany . " I mean .. . It 's true Roger and I never got along . He 's always tried to dominate me as well as everybody else . But he means well , and  --  " " And that 's why , " smiled Ellery , " you call yourself Crowe Macgowaninstead of Crowe Priam . " Crowe laughed . " Okay , I detest his lazy colon . We 've always fought like a couple of wild dogs . When Delia married him he would n't adopt me legally ; the idea was to keep me dependent on him . I was a kid , and it made me hate him . So I kept my father 's name and I refused to take any money from Roger . I was n't altogether a hero  --  I had a small income from a trust fund my father left for me . You can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . But then he finished lamely , " The last few years I 've grown up , I guess . I tolerate him for Mother 's sake . That 's it , " he added , brightening , " Mother 's sake . That 's why I 'd like to get to the bottom of this . You see , Mr. Queen ? " " Your mother loves Priam ? " " She 's married to him , is n't she ? " " Come off it , Mac . I intimated to you myself the other day , in your tree , that your mother had already offered to engage my services . Not to mention Laurel . What 's this all about ? " Macgowan got up angrily . " What difference does my reason make ? It 's an honest offer . All I want is this damned business cleaned up .

He switched on the light , blinking at his wristwatch. 4:35 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he mumbled . " Mr. Queen  --  " Delia Priam . " Yes ? " He had never felt so wakeful . " My son Crowe said to call you if  --  " She sounded far away , a little frightened . " Yes ? Yes ? " " It 's probably nothing at all . But you told Crowe  --  " " Delia , what 's happened ? " " Roger 's sick , Ellery . Dr. Voluta is here . He says it 's ptomaine poisoning . But - " " I 'll be right over ! " DR . VOLUTA WAS a floppy man with jowls and a dirty eye , and it was a case of hate at first sight . The doctor was in a bright blue yachting jacket over a yellow silk undershirt and his greasy brown hair stuck up all over his head . He wore carpet slippers . Twice Ellery caught himself about to address him as Captain Bligh and it would not have surprised him if , in his own improvised costume of soiled white ducks and turtleneck sweater , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn as Mr. Christian . " The trouble with you fellows , " Dr. Voluta was saying as he scraped an evil mess from a rumpled bedsheet into a specimen vial , " is that you really enjoy murder . Otherwise you would n't see it in every bellyache . " " Quite a bellyache , " said Ellery . " The stopper 's right there over the sink , Doctor . " " Thank you . Priam is a damn pig . He eats too much for even a wellTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 67man . His alimentary apparatus is a medical problem in itself . I 've warned him for years to lay off bedtime snacks , especially spicy fish . " " I 'm told he 's fond of spicy fish . " " I 'm fond of spicy blondes , Mr. Queen , " snapped Dr. Voluta , " but I keep my appetite within bounds . " " I thought you said there 's something wrong with the tuna . " " Certainly there 's something wrong with it . I tasted it myself . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd followed my orders he would n't have eaten any in the first place . " They were in the butler 's pantry , and Dr. Voluta was looking irritablyabout for something to cover a plastic dish into which he had dumped the remains of the tuna . " Then it 's your opinion , Doctor  --  ? " " I 've given you my opinion . The can of tuna was spoiled . Did n't you ever hear of spoiled canned goods , Mr. Queen ? " He opened his medical bag , grabbed a surgical glove , and stretched it over the top of the dish . " I 've examined the empty tin , Dr. Voluta . " Ellery had fished it out of the tin can container , thankful that in Los Angeles you had to keep cans separate from garbage . " I see no sign of a bulge , do you ? " " You 're just assuming that 's the tin it came from , " the doctor said disagreeably . " How do you know ? " " The cook told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She opened it just before she went to bed . And I found the tin at the top of the waste can . " Dr. Voluta threw up his hands . " Excuse me . I want to wash up . " Ellery followed him to the door of the downstairs lavatory . " Have to keep my eye on that vial and dish , Doctor , " he said apologetically . " Since you wo n't turn them over to me . " " You do n't mean a thing to me , Mr. Queen . I still think it 's all a lot of nonsense . But if this stuff has to be analyzed , I 'm turning it over to the police personally . Would you mind stepping back ? I 'd like to close this door . " " The vial , " said Ellery . " Oh , for God 's sake . " Dr. Voluta turned his back and opened the tap with a swoosh. 68 THE ORIGIN OF EVILThey were waiting for Lieutenant Keats . It was almost six o'clock and through the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cold . Priam was purged and asleep , his black beard jutting from the blankets on his reclining chair with a moribund majesty , so that all Ellery had been able to think of  --  before Alfred Wallace shut the door politely in his face  --  was Sennacherib the Assyrian in his tomb ; and that was no help . Wallace had locked Priam 's door from the inside . He was spending what was left of the night on the daybed in Priam 's room reserved for his use during emergencies . Crowe Macgowan had been snappish . " If I had n't made that promise , Queen , I 'd never have had Delia call you . All this stench about a little upchucking . Leave him to Voluta and go home . " And he had gone back to his oak , yawning . Old Mr. Collier , Delia Priam 's father , had quietly made himself a cup of tea in the kitchen and trotted back upstairs with it , pausing only long enough to chuckle to Ellery : " A fool and his gluttony are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't seen her at all . Ellery had rather built himself up to their middle-of-the-night meeting , although he was prepared to be perfectly correct . Of course , she could n't know that . By the time he arrived she had returned to her room upstairs . He was glad , in a way , that her sense of propriety was so delicately tuned to his state of mind . It was , in fact , astoundingly perceptive of her . At the same time , he felt a little empty . Ellery stared gritty-eyed at Dr. Voluta 's blue back . It was an immenseback , with great fat wrinkles running across it . He could , of course , get rid of the doctor and go upstairs and knock on her door . There was always a question or two to be asked in a case like this . He wondered what she would do . And how she looked at six in the morning . He played with this thought for some time . " Ordinarily , " said the doctor , turning and reaching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to hell .

I 'm not going to switch containerson you . Where the devil is that detective ? I have n't had any sleep at all tonight . " " Did anyone ever tell you , Doctor , " said Ellery through his teeth , " that you look like Charles Laughton in The Beachcomber ? " They glared at each other until a car drew up outside and Keats hurried in . AT FOUR O'CLOCK that afternoon Ellery pulled his rented Kaiser up before the Priam house to find Keats 's car already there . The maid with the tic , which was in an active state , showed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fieldstone fireplace , tapping his teeth with the edge of a sheet of paper . Laurel Hill , Crowe Macgowan , and Delia Priam were seated before him in a student attitude . Their heads swiveled as Ellery came in , and it seemed to him that Laurel was coldly expectant , young Macgowan uneasy , and Delia frightened . " Sorry , Lieutenant . I had to stop for gas . Is that the lab report ? " Keats handed him the paper . Their eyes followed . When Ellery handed the paper back , their eyes went with it . " Maybe you 'd better line it up for these folks , Mr. Queen , " said the detective . " I 'll take it from there . " " When I got here about five this morning , " nodded Ellery , " Dr. Voluta was sure it was food poisoning . The facts were these : Against Voluta 's medical advice , Mr. Priam invariably has something to eat before going to sleep . This habit of his seems to be a matter of common knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to bed at a late hour . The cook , Mrs. Guittierez , is on the other hand accustomed to retiring early . Consequently , Mr. Priam usually tells Mr. Wallace what he expects to feel like having around midnight , and Mr. Wallace usually transmits this information to the cook before she goes to bed . Mrs. Guittierez then prepares the snack as ordered , puts it into the refrigerator , and retires. 70 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " Last night the order came through for tuna fish , to which Mr. Priam is partial . Mrs. Guittierez got a can of tuna from the pantry  --  one of the leading brands , by the way  --  opened it , prepared the contentsas Mr. Priam likes it  --  with minced onion , sweet green pepper , celery , lots of mayonnaise , the juice of half a freshly squeezed lemon , freshly ground pepper and a little salt , a dash of Worcestershire sauce , a half-teaspoon of dried mustard , and a pinch of oregano and powderedthyme  --  and placed the bowl , covered , in the refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Guittierez left the kitchen at about twenty minutes of ten , leaving a night light burning . " At about ten minutes after midnight , " continued Ellery , speaking to the oil painting of the Spanish grandee above the fireplace so that he would not be disturbed by a certain pair of eyes , " Alfred Wallace was sent by Roger Priam for the snack . Wallace removed the bowl of tuna salad from the refrigerator , placed it on a tray with some caraway-seed rye bread , sweet butter , and a sealed bottle of milk , and carried the tray to Mr. Priam 's study . Priam ate heartily , although he did not finish the contents of the tray . Wallace then prepared him for bed , turned out the lights , and took what remained on the tray back to the kitchen . He left the tray there as it was , and himself went upstairs to his room . " At about three o'clock this morning Wallace was awakened by the buzzer of the intercom from Mr. Priam 's room . It was Priam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently sick . Wallace immediately phoned Dr. Voluta , ran upstairs and awakened Mrs. Priam , and the two of them did what they could until Dr. Voluta 's arrival , which was a very few minutes later . " Macgowan said irritably , " Damned if I can see why you tell us  --  " Delia Priam put her hand on her son 's arm and he stopped . " Go on , Mr. Queen , " she said in a low voice . When she talked , everything in a man tightened up . He wondered if she quite realized the quality and range of her power . " On my arrival I found the tray in the kitchen , where Wallace said he had left it . When I had the facts I phoned Lieutenant Keats . While waiting for him I got together everything that had been used in the preparation of the midnight meal  --  the spices , the empty tuna tin , THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 71even the shell of the lemon , as well as the things on the tray . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the butter , some of the milk . Meanwhile Dr. Voluta preserved what he could of the regurgitated matter . When Lieutenant Keats arrived , we turned everything over to him . " Ellery stopped and lit a cigaret . Keats said : " I took it all down to the Crime Laboratory and the report just came through . " He glanced at the paper . " I wo n't bother you with the detailed report . Just give you the highlights . " Chemical analysis of the regurgitated matter from Mr. Priam 's stomach brought out the presence of arsenic . " Everything is given a clean bill  --  spices , tuna tin , lemon , bread , butter , milk  --  everything , that is , but the tuna salad itself . " Arsenic of the same type was found in the remains of the tuna salad . " Dr. Voluta was wrong , " said Keats . " This is not a case of ptomaine poisoning caused by spoiled fish . It 's a case of arsenical poisoning caused by the introduction of arsenic into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 9:40 last night . Mr. Wallace came and took it to Mr. Priam around ten minutes after midnight . During that period the kitchen was empty , with only a dim light burning . During those two and a half hours someone sneaked into the kitchen and poisoned the salad . " " There ca n't have been any mistake , " added Ellery . " There is a bowl of something for Mr. Priam in the refrigerator every night . It 's a special bowl , used only for his snacks . It 's even more easily identified than that  --  it has the name Roger in gilt lettering on it , a gift to Roger Priam from Alfred Wallace last Christmas . " " The question is , " concluded Keats , " who tried to poison Mr. Priam . " He looked at the three in a friendly way . Delia Priam , rising suddenly , murmured , " It 's so incredible , " and put a handkerchief to her nose . Laurel smiled at the older woman 's back . " That 's the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " ever since Daddy 's death . " 72 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " Oh , for Pete 's sake , Laur , " snapped Delia 's son , " do n't keep smilinglike Lady Macbeth , or Cassandra , or whoever it was . The last thing in the world Mother and I want is a mess . " " Nobody 's accusing you , Mac , " said Laurel . " My only point is that now maybe you 'll believe I was n't talking through clouds of opium . " " All right ! " Delia turned to Keats . Ellery saw Keats look her over uncomfortably , but with that avidity for detail which can not be disciplined in the case of certain women . She was superb today , all in white , with a large wooden crucifix on a silver chain girdling her waist . No slit in this skirt ; long sleeves ; and the dress came up high to the neck . But her back was bare to the waist . Some Hollywood designer 's idea of personalized fashion ; did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , even the most respectable , have the wickedest innocence in this sort of thing , mused Ellery ; it really was n't fair to a hardworkingpolice officer who wore a gold band on the fourth finger of his left hand . " Lieutenant , do the police have to come into this ? " she asked . " Ordinarily , Mrs. Priam , I could answer a question like that right off the bat . " Keats 's eyes shifted ; he put an unlit cigaret between his lips and rolled it nervously to the corner of his mouth . A note of stubbornnesscrept into his voice . " But this is something I 've never run into before . Your husband refuses to co-operate . He wo n't even discuss it with me . All he said was that he wo n't be caught that way again , that he could take care of himself , and that I was to pick up my hat on the way out . " Delia went to a window . Studying her back , Ellery thought that she was relieved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 'd have to have a little skull session with Keats on the best way to handle Mrs. Priam . But that back was disturbing . " Tell me , Mrs. Priam , is he nuts ? " " Sometimes , Lieutenant , " murmured Delia without turning , " I wonder . " " I 'd like to add , " said Keats abruptly , " that Joe Dokes and his Ethiopian brother could have dosed that tuna . The kitchen back door was n't locked . There 's gravel back there , and woods beyond . It wouldTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 73have been a cinch for anyone who 'd cased the household and found out about the midnight snack routine . There seems to be a tie-up with somebody from Mr. Priam 's and Mr. Hill 's past  --  somebody who 's had it in for both of them fot a long time . I 'm not overlooking that . But I 'm not overlooking the possibility that that 's a lot of soda pop , too . It could be a cover-up . In fact , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge-and-slow-death business . I just wanted everybody to know that . Okay , Mr. Queen , I 'm through . " He kept looking at her back . Brother , thought Ellery with compassion . And he said , " You may be right , Keats , but I 'd like to point out a curious fact that appears in this lab report . The quantity of arsenic apparently used , says the report , was not sufficient to cause death . ' " " A mistake , " said the detective . " It happens all the time . Either they use way too much or way too little . " " Not all the time , Lieutenant . And from what 's happened so far , I do n't see this character  --  whoever he is  --  as the impulsive , emotionaltype of killer . If this is all tied up , it has a pretty careful and coldblooded brain behind it . The kind of criminal brain that does n't make simple mistakes like underdosing .

For each pace forward a warning . ' The poisoning attack is a warning to Roger Priam to follow up whatever was in the box he received the morning Hill got the dead dog . Priam 's warning number one  --  unknown . Warning number two  --  poisoned tuna . Lovely problem . " " I do n't admire your taste in problems , " said Crowe Macgowan . " What 's it mean ? All this  --  this stuff ? " " It means , Mac , that I 'm forced to accept your assignment , " replied Ellery . " And yours , Laurel , and yours , Delia .

Laurel said , " Then we 're all nicely set , " in a perfectly flat voice , and she walked out . THE NIGHT WAS chilly , and Laurel walked briskly along the path , the beam of her flashlight bobbing before her . Her legs were bare under the long suede coat and they felt goosepimply . When she came to the great oak she stabbed at the green ceiling with her light . " Mac . You awake ? " Macgowan 's big face appeared in her beam . " Laurel ? " he said incredulously . " It 's not Esther Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these woods at night ? " The rope ladder hurtled to her feet . " What do you want to be , a sex murder in tomorrow 's paper ? " " You 'd be the natural suspect . " Laurel began to climb , her light streaking about the clearing . " Wait , will you ! I 'll put on the flood . " Macgowan disappeared . A moment later the glade was bright as a studio set . " That 's why I 'm nervous , " he grinned , reappearing . His long arm yanked her to the platform . " Boy , is this cosy . Come on in . " " Turn off the flood , Mac . I 'd like some privacy . " " Sure ! " He was back in a moment , lifting her off her feet . She let him carry her into his tree house and deposit her on the rollaway bed , which was made up for the night . " Wait till I turn the radio off .

" " Huh ? " " On the floor . I want to talk to you . " " Did n't you ever hear of the language of the eyes and so forth ? " " Tonight it has to come out here . " Laurel leaned back on her arms , smiling at him . He was beginning to glower . But then he folded up at her feet and put his head on her knees . Laurel moved him , drew her coat over her legs , and replaced his head . " All right , then , let it out ! " " Mac , " said Laurel , " why did you hire Ellery Queen ?

If we 've got to talk . " " Sorry . That 's my subject for tonight . " He encircled his mammoth legs , scowling through the smoke at his bare feet . " Laurel , how long have we known each other ? " " Since we were kids . " She was surprised . " Grew up together , did n't we ? " " We certainly did . " " Have I ever done anything out of line ? " " No , " Laurel laughed softly , " but it 's not because you have n't tried . " " Why , you little squirt , I could break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket .

" " Well , I 've used it , " he growled . " Now let me hear your side of it . " " Say it again , Mac ? " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 77 " Love ! I love you ! " " In that tone of voice ? " She found herself off the bed and on the floor , in his arms . " Damn you , " he whispered , " I love you . " She stared up at him . " Mac  --  " " I love you . . . " Mac , let go of me ! " She wriggled out of his arms and jumped to her feet . " I suppose , " she cried , " that 's the reason you hired him ! Because you love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the reason ?

Out of the reek his voice mumbled something ineffectual . Then it stopped . When the smoke cleared , he was lying there with his eyes shut . " You wo n't tell me . " " Laur , I ca n't . It 's got ... nothing to do with anything . Just some cockeyed thing of my own . " Laurel seated herself on the bed again . He was very long , and broad , and brown and muscular and healthy-looking . She took a Dunhill from her coat pocket and lit it with shaky fingers . But when she spoke , she sounded calm . " There are too many mysteries around here , Chesty . I know there 's one about you , and where you 're concerned . . . His eyes opened . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool .

" All right , we 'll let that go . Now about this love business . " She put her hand in his curly hair , gripping . He looked up at herthoroughly startled . She leaned forward and kissed him on the lips . " That 's for thanks . You 're such a beautiful man , Mac . . . you see , a girl has her secrets , too  --  No ! Mac , no .

But it 's all in the world I 'm interested in right now . If the law gets him , fine . But if . . . " " For God 's sake ! " Crowe scrambled to his feet , his face bilious . A short-nosed little automatic had materialized in Laurel 's hand and it was pointing absently at his navel . " If they do n't , I 'll find him myself . And when I do , Mac , I 'll shoot him as dead as that dog . If they send me to the gas chamber for it . " " Laurel , put that blamed thing back in your pocket !

But until you do  --  " Laurel cried out . The gun was in his hand . He turned it over curiously . " Nasty little beanshooter . Until you do , Red , do n't let anybody take this away from you , " and he dropped it politely into her pocket , picked her up , and sat down on the bed with her . A little later Laurel was saying faintly , " Mac , I did n't come here for this . " " Surprise . " " Mac , what do you think of Ellery Queen ? " " I think he 's got a case on Ma , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " How acute of you . I think he has , too . But that 's not what I meant . I meant professionally . " " Oh , he 's a nice enough guy ...

I 've dropped in on him twice and phoned him I do n't know how many times in the past couple of days , and he 's always there . Sitting in his crow 's nest , smoking and scanning the horizon .

" " Taking a crack at what ? " " At what he ought to be doing . " " Detecting ? " The big fellow was incredulous . " I do n't care what you call it . Hunting for facts , if that sounds less movie-ish . Anything that will get somewhere . " " Red Hill , Lady Dick , and Her Muscle Man , " said young Macgowan , touching the ceiling with both hands . " You know ? It appeals to me . " Laurel looked up at him coldly . " I 'm not gagging , Mac . " " Who 's gagging ? Your brain , my sinews  --  " " Never mind . Good night . " " Hey ! " His big hand caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-cocky . I 'm really going birdy up here , Laurel . It 's tough squatting in this tree waiting for the big boom . How would you go about it ?

We 're not going to have any code words in Turkish or wear disguises or meet in mysterious8o THE ORIGIN OF EVILbistros . It 's going to be a lot of footwork and maybe nothing but blisters to show for it . If you understand that and still want to come in , all right . Anything else , I go it solo . " " I hope you 'll put a skirt on , or at least long pants , " the giant said morosely . " Where do we start ? " " We should have started on that dead dog . Long ago . Where it came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . But now that 's as cold as I am . . . I 'd say , Mac , " said Laurel , leaning against the jamb with her hands in her pockets , " the arsenic . That 's fresh , and it 's something to go on . Somebody got into the kitchen over there and mixed arsenic in with Roger 's tuna . Arsenic ca n't be too easy to get hold of . It must leave a trail of some sort . " " I never thought of that . How the dickens would you go about tracingit ? " " I 've got some ideas . But there 's one thing we ought to do before that . The tuna was poisoned in the house . So that 's the place to start looking . " " Let 's go . " Macgowan reached for a dark blue sweater . " Now ? " Laurel sounded slightly dismayed . " Know a better time ? " MRS . WILLIAMS CAME in and stumbled over a chair . " Mr. Queen ? You in here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put on a light ? " She found the switch . Ellery was bunched in a corner of the sofa , feet on the picture window , looking at Hollywood . It looked like a fireworks display , popping lights in all colors . " Your dinner 's cold . " " Leave it on the kitchen table , Mrs. Williams . You go on home . " She sniffed . " It 's that Miss Hill and the naked man , only he 's got clothes on this evening . " " Why did n't you say so ! " Ellery sprang from the sofa . " Laurel , Mac ! Come in . " They were smiling , but Ellery thought they both looked a little peaked . Crowe Macgowan was in a respectable suit ; he even wore a tie . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 81 " Well , well , still communing with mysterious thoughts , eh , Queen ? We 're not interrupting anything momentous ? " " As far as I can see , " said Laurel , " he has n't moved from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly , " we have some news for you . " " News ? For me ? " " We 've found out something . " " I wondered why Mac was dressed , " said Ellery . " Here , sit down and tell me all about it . You two been on the trail ? " " There 's nothing to this detective racket , " said the giant , stretching his legs . " You twerps have been getting away with mayhem . Tell him , Red . " " We decided to do a little detecting on our own  --  " " That sounds to me , " murmured Ellery , " like the remark of a dissatisfiedclient . " " That 's what it is . " Laurel strode around smoking a cigaret . " We 'd better have an understanding , Ellery . I hired you to find a killer . I did n't expect you to produce him in twenty-four hours necessarily , but I did expect something  --  some sign of interest , maybe even a twitch or two of activity . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked ! " " Not a bad system , Laurel , " said Ellery , reaching for a pipe . " I 've worked that way for years . " " Well , I do n't care for it ! " " Am I fired ? " " I did n't say that  --  " " I think all the lady wants to do , " said young Macgowan , " is give you a jab , Queen . She does n't think thinking is a substitute for foot-work . " " Each has its place , " Ellery said amiably  --  " sit down , Laurel , wo n't you ? Each has its place , and thinking 's place can be very important . I 'm not altogether ignorant of what 's been going on , seated though I 've remained . Let 's see if I ca n't  --  er  --  think this out for you . . . " He closed his eyes . " I would say , " he said after a moment , " that you two have been tracking down the arsenic with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . " Is that right so far ? " " That 's right , " cried Macgowan. 82 THE ORIGIN OF EVILLaurel glared . " How did you know ? " Ellery tapped his forehead . " Never sell cerebration short . Now ! What exactly have you accomplished ? I look into my mental ball and I see . . . you and Mac . . . discovering a . . . can of . . . a can of rat poison in the Priam cellar . " They were open-mouthed . " Yes . Rat poison . And you found that this particular rat poison contains arsenic ... arsenic , the poison which was also found in Priam 's salad . How 'm I doin ' ? " Laurel said feebly , " But I ca n't imagine how you ... " Ellery had gone to the blondewood desk near the window and pulled a drawer open . Now he took out a card and glanced over it . " Yes . You traced the purchase of that poison , which bears the brand name of D-e-t-h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named substance was purchased on May the thirteenth of this year at ... let me see . . . at Kepler 's Pharmacy at 1723 North Highland . " Laurel looked at Macgowan . He was grinning . She glared at him and then back at Ellery . " You questioned either Mr. Kepler himself , " Ellery went on , " or  --  his clerk , Mr. Candy  --  unfortunately my crystal ball went blank at this point . But one of them told you that the can of Deth-on-Ratz was bought by a tall , handsome man whom he identified  --  probably from a set of snapshots you had with you  --  as Alfred Wallace . Correct , Laurel ? " Laurel said tightly , " How did you find out ? " " Why , Red , I leave these matters to those who can attend to them far more quickly and efficiently than I  --  or you , Red . Or the Atomic Age Tree Boy over here . Lieutenant Keats had all that information within a few hours and he passed it along to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can sit here in comfort and think ? " Laurel 's lip wiggled and Ellery burst into laughter . He shook up her hair and tilted her chin . " Just the same , that was enterprising of you , Laurel . That was all right . " " Not so all right . " Laurel sank into a chair , tragic . " I 'm sorry , Ellery . You must think I 'm an imbecile . " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 83 " Not a bit of it . It 's just that you 're impatient . This business is a matter of legs , brains , and bottoms , and you 've got to learn to wait on the last-named with philosophy while the other two are pumping away . What else did you find out ? " " Nothing , " said Laurel miserably . " I thought it was quite a piece , " said Crowe Macgowan . " Finding out that Alfred bought the poison that knocked Roger for a loop .. that ought to mean something , Queen . " " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dryly , " I 'm afraid you 're in for a bad time . Keats found out something else . " " What 's that ? " " It was your mother , Mac , who thought she heard mice in the cellar . It was your mother who told Wallace to buy the rat poison . " The boy gaped , and Laurel looked down at her hands suddenly . " Do n't be upset , Mac . No action is going to be taken . Even though the mice seem to have been imaginary  --  we could find no turds or holes . . . The fact is , we have nothing positive . There 's no direct evidence that the arsenic in Priam 's tuna salad came from the can of rat poison in the cellar . There 's no direct evidence that either your mother or Wallace did anything but try to get rid of mice who happen not to have been there . " " Well , of course not . " Macgowan had recovered ; he was even lookingpugnacious . " Stupid idea to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurel . Everything 's under control . Let 's leave it that way . " " All right , " said Laurel . She was still studying her hands . But Ellery said , " No . I do n't see it that way . It 's not a bad notion at all for you two to root around . You 're on the scene  --  " If you think I 'm going to rat on my mother , " began Crowe angrily . " We seem to be in a rodent cycle , " Ellery complained . " Are you worried that your mother may have tried to poison your stepfather , Mac ? " " No ! I mean  --  you know what I mean ! What kind of rat  --  skunk do you think I am ? " " I got you into this , Mac , " Laurel said . " I 'm sorry . You can back out . " 84 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " I 'm not backing out ! Seems to me you two are trying to twist every word I say ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellery with a smile , " where Wallace is concerned ? " " Hell , no . Wallace does n't mean anything to me . Delia does . " Her son added , with a sulky shrewdness , " I thought she did to you , too . " " Well , she does . " The truth was , Keats 's information about Delia Priam and the rat poison had given him a bad time . " But let 's stick to Wallace for the moment . Mac , what do you know about him ? " " Not a thing . " " How long has he been working for your stepfather ? " " About a year . They come and go . Roger 's had a dozen stooges in the last fifteen years . Wallace is just the latest . " " Well , you keep your eye on him . And Laurel  --  " " On Delia , " said Macgowan sarcastically . " Laurel on everything . Keep giving me reports . Anything out of the ordinary . This case may prove to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . Dig in . " " I could go back to the beginning , " mumbled Laurel , " and try to trace the dead dog ... " " Oh , you do n't know about that , do you ? " Ellery turned to the writing desk again . " About the dog ? " He turned around with another card . " The dog belonged to somebodynamed Henderson who lives on Clybourn Avenue in the Toluca Lake district . He 's a dwarf who gets occasional work in films . The dog 's name was Frank . Frank disappeared on Decoration Day . Henderson reported his disappearance to the Pound Department , but his description was vague and unfortunately Frank had no license  --  Henderson , it seems , is against bureaucracy and regimentation . When the dog 's body was picked up at your house , Laurel , in view of its lack of identification it was disposed of in the usual way . It was only afterwardthat Henderson identified the collar , which was returned to him . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 85 " Keats has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for sentimental reasons . Keats doubts , though , that anything can be learned from it . There 's no trace of the little silver box which was attached to the collar . The receipt Henderson signed at the Pound Department mentions it , but Henderson says he threw it away as not belonging to him . " As for what the dog died of , an attendant at the Pound remembered the animal and he expressed the opinion that Frank had died of poisoning . Asked if it could have been arsenic poisoning , the man said , yes , it could have been arsenic poisoning . In the absence of an analysis of the remains , the opinion is worthless . All we can do is speculate that the dog was fed something with arsenic in it , which is interesting as speculation but meaningless as evidence . And that 's the story of the dead dog , Laurel . You can forget it . " " I 'll help wherever I can , " said Laurel in a subdued voice . " And again , Ellery  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My fault for not having kept you up to date . " Ellery put his arm around her , and she smiled faintly . " Oh , Mac , " he said . " There 's something personal I want to say to Laurel . Would you mind giving me a couple of minutes with her alone ? " " Seems to me , " grumbled the giant , rising , " as a bloodhound you 've got a hell of a wolf strain in you , Queen . " His jaw protruded . " Lay off my mother , hear me ? Or I 'll crack your clavicles for soup ! " " Oh , stop gibbering , Mac , " said Laurel quickly . " Laur , do you want to be alone with this character ? " " Wait for me in the car . " Mac almost tore the front door off its , hinges . " Mac is something like a great Dane himself , " Laurel murmured , her back to the door . " Huge , honest , and a little dumb . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Laurel ? " Ellery eyed her . " About me ? That was n't dumb . I admit I 've found Delia Priam very attractive . " " I did n't mean dumb about you . " Laurel shook her head . " Never mind , Ellery . What did you want ? " " Dumb about Delia ? Laurel , you know something about Mac 's mother  --  " 86 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " If it 's Delia you want to question me about , I  --  I ca n't answer . May I go now , please ? " " Right away . " Ellery put his hand on the doorknob , looking down at her cinnamon hair . " You know , Laurel , Lieutenant Keats has done some work at your house , too . " Her eyes flew to his . " What do you mean ? " " Questioning your housekeeper , the chauffeur , the houseman . " " They did n't say anything about me ! " " You 're dealing with a professional , Laurel , and a very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His eyes were grave . " A few weeks ago you lost or mislaid a small silver box , Laurel . A sort of pillbox . " She had gone pale , but her voice was steady . " That 's right . " " From the description Mrs. Monk , Simeon , and Ichiro gave  --  you 'd asked them to look for it  --  the box must have been about the same size and shape as the one you told me contained the warning note to your father . Keats wanted to quiz you about it immediately , but I told him I 'd handle it myself . Laurel , was it your silver box that was attached to the collar of Henderson 's defunct dog ? " " I do n't know . " " Why did n't you mention to me the fact that a box of the same description belonging to you had disappeared shortly before June second ? " " Because I was sure it could n't have been the same one . The very idea was ridiculous . How could it have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , and I think The Broadway and other department stores have been carrying it , too . It 's advertised for carrying vitamin tablets and things like that . There must have been thousands of them sold all over Los Angeles . I really bought it to give to Daddy . He had to take certain pills and he could have carried this around in his watch pocket . But I mislaid it  --  " " Could it have been your pillbox ? " " I suppose it could , but  --  " " And you never found the one you lost ? " She looked at him , worried . " Do you suppose it was ? " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 87 " I 'm not supposing much of anything yet , Laurel . Just trying to get things orderly . Or just trying to get things . " Ellery opened the door and looked out cautiously . " Be sure to tell your muscular admirer that I 'm returning you to him virgo intacto . I 'm sort of sentimental about my clavicles . " He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight around the lower curve of the hill , not smiling at all . ELLERY WENT DOWN to his cold supper and chewed away . The cottage was cheerlessly silent . His jaws made sounds . Then there was a different sound . A tap on the kitchen door ? Ellery stared . " Come in ? " And there she was . " Delia . " He got out of his chair , still holding the knife and fork . She was in a long loose coat of some dark blue material . It had aturned-up collar which framed her head . She stood with her backagainst the door , looking about the room . " I 've been waiting in the back garden in the dark . I saw Laurel 's car . And after Laurel and . . . Crowe drove away I thought I 'd betterwait a little longer . I was n't sure that your housekeeper was gone . " " She 's gone . " " That 's good . " She laughed . " Where is your car , Delia ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the hill . Walked up . Ellery , this is a darling kitchen  --  " " Discreet , " said Ellery . He had not stirred . " Are n't you going to ask me in ? " He said slowly , " I do n't think I 'm going to . " Her smile withered . But then it burgeoned again . " Oh , do n't sound so serious . I was passing by and I thought I 'd drop in and see how you were getting on  --  " " With the case . " " Of course . " She had dimples . Funny , he had never noticed them before. 88 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " This is n't a good idea , Delia . " " What is n't ? " " This is a small town , Delia , and it 's all eyes and ears . It does n't take much in Hollywood to destroy a woman 's reputation . " " Oh , that . " She was silent . Then she showed her teeth . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just that sometimes . . . " She stopped , and she shivered suddenly . " Sometimes what , Delia ? " " Nothing . I 'm going .  --  Is there anything new ? " " Just that business about the rat poison . " She shrugged . " I really thought there were mice . " " Of course . " " Good night , Ellery . " " Good night , Delia . " He did not offer to walk her down the hill and she did not seem to expect it . He stared at the kitchen door for a long time . Then he went upstairs and poured himself a stiff drink . AT THREE IN the morning Ellery gave up trying to sleep and crawled out of bed . He turned on the lights in the living room , loaded and fired his brier , turned the lights out , and sat down to watch Hollywoodglimmer scantily below . Light always disturbed him when he was groping in the dark . And he was groping , and this was darkness . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely the absence of answer . Answer it , and the puzzle vanished . Nor was he bothered by the nimbus of fantasy which surrounded the case like a Los Angeles daybreak fog . All crimes were fantastic insofar as they expressedwhat most people merely dreamed about . The dream of the unknown enemy had been twenty years or more in the making . . . He clucked to himself in the darkness . Back to the writer of the note . The wonder was not that he made gifts of poisoned dogs and wrote odd notes relishing slow death and promising mysterious warnings with special meanings . The wonder was that he had been able to keepTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 89his hatred alive for almost a generation ; and that was not fantasy , but sober pathology . Fantasy was variance from normal experience , a matter of degree . Hollywood had always attracted its disproportionate quota of variants from the norm . In Vandalia , Illinois , Roger Priam would have been encysted in the community like a foreign substance , but in the Southern California canyons he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the houri paradise of Hollywood she belonged , the female archetype from whom all desire sprang . And Tree Boy , who in New York would have been dragged off to the observation ward of Bellevue Hospital , was here just another object of civic admiration , rating columns of good-natured newspaper space . No , it was n't the fantasy . It was the hellish scarcity of facts . Here was an enemy out of the past . What past ? No data . The enemy was preparing a series of warnings . What were they ? A dead dog had been the first . Then the unknown contents of a small cardboard box . Then a deliberately nonlethal dose of arsenic . The further warnings , the warnings that were promised , had not yet come forth . How many would there be ? They were warnings of " special meaning . " A series , then . A pattern . But what connection could exist between a dead dog and an arsenic-salted tunafish salad ? It would help , help greatly , to know what had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that Leander Hill was stooping over the body of the dog and reading the thin , multi-creased note . Yes , greatly . But . . . no data . It was probable that , whatever it was , Priam had destroyed it . But Priam knew . How could the man be made to talk ? He must be made to talk . The darkness was darker than even that . Ellery mused , worrying his pipe . There was a pattern , all right , but how could he be sure it was the only pattern ? Suppose the dead hound had been the first warning of special meaning in a proposed series to Hill , the other warnings of which were forever lost in the limbo of an unknown mind because of Hill 's premature death ? And suppose whatever was . in Priam 's box was the first warning of a second series , of which the second warning was the poisoning  --  a series having no significantgo THE ORIGIN OF EVILrelation to the one aborted by Hill 's heart attack ? It was possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning between Hill 's and Priam 's warnings . The safest course for the time being was to ignore the dead dog received by Hill and to concentrate on the living Priam , proceeding on the assumption that the unknown contents of Priam 's box and the poisoning of his salad constituted a separate series altogether ... . Ellery went back to bed . His last thought was that he must find out at any cost what had been in that box , and that he could only wait for the third warning to Priam . But he dreamed of Delia Priam in a jungle thicket , showing her teeth . SeverAS ELLERY WAS able to put it together when he arrived at Delia Priam 's summons that fabulous Sunday morning  --  from the stories of Delia , Alfred Wallace , and old Mr. Collier  --  Delia had risen early to go to church . Beyond remarking that her church attendance was " spotty , " she was reticent about this ; Ellery gathered that she could not go as regularly as she would like because of the peculiar conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slip away and into one of the old churches where , to " the blessed mutter of the mass , " she returned to her childhood and her blood . This had been such a morning , five days after the poisoning attack on her husband , two after her strange visit to Ellery 's cottage . While Delia had been up and about at an early hour , Alfred Wallacehad risen late . He was normally an early riser , because Priam was a demanding charge and Wallace had learned that if he was to enjoy the luxury of breakfast he must get it over with before Priam awakened . On Sundays , however , Priam preferred to lie in bed until midmorning , undisturbed , and this permitted Wallace to sleep until nine o'clock . Delia 's father was invariably up with the birds . On this morning he had breakfasted with his daughter , and when she drove off to Los Angeles Mr. Collier went out for his early morning tramp through the woods . On his way back he had stopped before the big oak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer from the tree house beyond Crowe 's Brobdingnagian snores the old man had returned to the Priam house and gone into the library . The library was downstairs off the main hall , directly opposite the door to Roger Priam 's quarters , with the staircase between . This was shortly after92 THE ORIGIN OF EVILeight , Mr. Collier told Ellery ; his son-in-law 's door was shut and there was no light visible under the door ; all seemed as it always was at that hour of a Sunday morning ; and the old man had got his postage stamp albums out of a drawer of the library desk , his stamp hinges , his tongs , and his Scott 's catalogue , and he had set to work mounting his latest mail purchases of stamps . " I 've done a lot of knocking about the world , " he told Ellery , " and it 's corking fun to collect stamps from places I 've actually been in . Want to see my collection ? " Ellery had declined ; he was rather busy at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came downstairs . He exchanged greetings with Delia 's father  --  the library door stood open  --  and went in to his breakfast without approaching Priam 's door . Mrs. Guittierez served him , and Wallace read the Sunday papers , which were always delivered to the door , as he ate . It was the maid 's and chauffeur 's Sunday off and the house was unusually quiet . In the kitchen the cook was getting things ready for Roger Priam 's breakfast . Shortly before ten o'clock Alfred Wallace painstakingly restored the Sunday papers to their original state , pushed back his chair , and went out into the hall carrying the papers . Priam liked to have the newspapers within arm 's reach when he awakened Sunday mornings , and he flew into a rage if they were crumpled or disarranged . Seeing a line of light beneath Priam 's door , Wallace quickened his step . He went in without knocking . The first he knew anything out of the ordinary had occurred , said Mr. Collier , he heard Wallace 's cry from Roger Priam 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! " The old man jumped up from his stamp albums and ran across the hall . Wallace was rattling the telephone , trying to get the operator . Just as he was shouting to Collier , " See about Mr. Priam ! See if he 's all rightl " the operator responded , and Wallace  --  who seemed in a panic  --  babbled something about the police and Lieutenant Feats . Collier picked his way across the room to his son-in-law 's wheelchair , which was still made up as a bed . Priam , in his night clothes , was up on one elbow , glaring aboutTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 93with a sort of vitreous horror . His mouth was open and his beard was in motion , but no sound passed them . As far as the old man could see , there was nothing wrong with Priam but stupefying fright . Collier eased the paralyzed man backward until he was supine , trying to soothe him ; but Priam lay rigid , as if in a coma , his eyes tightly shut to keep out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no response from him . At this moment , Delia Priam returned from church . Wallace turned from the phone and Collier from Priam-at a choked sound from the doorway . Delia was staring into the room with eyes sick with disbelief . She was paler than her husband and she seemed about to faint . " All this ... all these ... " She began to titter . Wallace said roughly , " Get her out of here . " " He 's dead . He 's dead ! " Collier hurried to her . " No , no , daughter . Just scared . Now you go upstairs . We 'll take care of Roger . " " He 's not dead ? Then why  --  ? How do these  --  ? " " Delia . " The old man stroked her hand . " Do n't touch anything . Anything ! " " No , no , daughter  --  " " Nothing must be touched . It 's got to be left exactly as you found it . Exactly . " And Delia stumbled up the hall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Priam house a radio patrol car was already parked in the driveway . R young officer was in the car , making a report to headquarters by radio , his mouth going like a faucet . His mate was apparently in the house . " Here , you . " He jumped out of the car . " Where you going ? " His face was red . " I 'm a friend of the family , Officer . Mrs. Priam just telephoned me . " Ellery looked rather wild himself . Delia had been hysterical over the phone and the only word he had been able to make out , " fogs , " had conveyed nothing reasonable . " What 's happened ? " 94 THE ORIGIN OF EVII , " I would n't repeat it , " said the patrolman excitedly . " I would n't lower myself . They think I 'm drunk . What do they think 1 am ? Sunday morning ! I 've seen a lot of crosseyed things in this town , but  --  " " Here , get hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know ? " " They caught him at home . He 's on his way here now . " Ellery bounded up the steps . As he ran into the hall he saw Delia . She was dressed for town , in black and modest dress , hat , and gloves , and she was leaning against a wall bloodlessly . Alfred Wallace , disheveledand unnerved , was holding one of her gloved hands in both of his , whispering to her . The tableau dissolved in an instant ; Delia spied Ellery , said something quickly to Wallace , withdrawing her hand , and she ran forward . Wallace turned , rather startled . He followed her with a hasty shuffle , almost as if he were afraid of being left alone . " Ellery . " " Is Mr. Priam all right ? " " He 's had a bad shock . " " Ca n't say I blame him , " Wallace mumbled . The handsome man passed a trembling handkerchief over his cheeks . " The doctor 's on his way over . We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's this about fogs , ' Delia ? " Ellery hurried up the hall , Delia clinging to his arm . Wallace remained where he was , still wiping his face . " Fogs ? I did n't say fogs . I said  --  " Ellery stopped in the doorway . The other radio car patrolman was straddling a chair , cap pushed back on his head , looking about helplessly . Roger Priam lay stiffly on his bed staring at the ceiling . And all over Priam 's body , on his blanket , on his sheet , in the shelves and compartments of his wheelchair , on his typewriter , strewn about the floor , the furniture , Wallace 's emergency bed , the window sills , the cornices , the fireplace , the mantelpiece  --  everywhere  --  were frogs . Frogs and toads . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 95Hundreds of frogs and toads . Tiny tree toads . Yellow-legged frogs . Bullfrogs . Each little head was twisted . The room was littered with their corpses . ELLERY HAD TO confess to himself that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that crossed over the line of laughter into the darker regions of the mind . Beyond the black bull calf of the Nile with the figure of an eagle on his back and the beetle upon his tongue stood Apis , a god ; beyond absurdity loomed fear . Fear was the timeless tyrant . At mid-twentieth century it took the shape of a gigantic mushroom . Why not frogs ? With frogs the terribleWrath of the Hebrews had plagued the Egyptian , with frogs and blood and wild beasts and darkness and the slaying of the first-born ... He could hardly blame Roger Priam for lying frozen . Priam knew something of the way of gods ; he was by way of being a minor one himself . While Keats and the patrolmen tramped about the house , Ellery drifted around the Priam living room trying to get a bearing . The whole thing irritated and enchanted him . It made no sense . It related to nothing . There lay its power over the uninitiated ; that was its appearancefor the mob . But Priam was of the inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew the sense this nonsense made . He knew the nature of the mystery to which it related . He knew the nature of this primitive god and he grasped the meaning of the god 's symbolism . Knowledge is not always power ; certainty does not alwaysbring peace . This knowledge was paralyzing and this certainty brought terror . Keats found him nibbling his thumb under the Spanish grandee . " Well , the doctor 's gone and the frogs are all collected and maybe you and I had better have a conference about this . " " Sure . " " This is what you 'd call Priam 's third warning , is n't it ? " " Yes , Keats . " 96 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " Me , " said the detective , seating himself heavily on a heavy chair , " I 'd call it broccoli . " " Do n't make that mistake . " , Keats looked at him in a resentful way . " I do n't go for this stuff , Mr. Queen . I do n't believe it even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this trouble ? " His tone said he would have appreciated a nice , uncomplicated bullet . " How is Priam ? " " He 'll live . The problem was this doctor , Voluta . It seems we took him away from a party  --  a blonde party  --  at Malibu . He took the frogs as a personal insult . Treated Priam for shock , put him to sleep , and dove for his car . " " Have you talked to Priam ? " " I talked to Priam , yes . But he did n't talk to me . " " Nothing ? " " He just said he woke up , reached for that push-button-on-a-cord arrangement he 's got for turning on the lights , saw the little beasties , and knew no more . " " No attempt at explanation ? " " You do n't think he knows the answer to this one ! " " The strong man type represented by our friend Priam , Lieutenant , " said Ellery , " does n't pass out at the sight of a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed . His reaction was too violent . Of course he knows the answer . And it scares the wadding out of him . " Keats shook his head . " What do we do now ? " " What did you find out ? " " Not a thing . " " No sign of a point of entry ? " " No . But what sign would there be ? You come from the suspicious East , Mr. Queen . This is the great West , where men are men and nobody locks his door but Easterners . " Keats rolled a tattered cigaret to the other side of his mouth . " Not even , " he said bitterly , " taxpayers who are on somebody 's knock-off list . " He jumped up with a frustratedenergy . " The trouble is , this Priam wo n't face the facts . Poison him , and he looks thoughtful . Toss a couple hundred dead frogsTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 97around his bedroom and he shakes his head doubtfully . You know what I think ? I think everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . " But Ellery was walking a tight circle , squinting toward some hidden horizon . " All right , he got in without any trouble  --  simply by walking in . Presumably in the middle of the night . Priam 's door is n't locked at night so that Wallace or the others can get at him in an emergency , consequently he enters Priam 's room with equal facility . So there he is , with a bag or a suitcase full of murdered frogs . Priam is asleep  --  not dead , mind you , just asleep . But he might just as well have been dead , because his visitor distributed two or three hundred frogs about the premises  --  in the dark , mind you  --  without disturbingPriam in the least . Any answers , Lieutenant ? " " Yes , " said Keats wearily . " Priam polished off a bottle last night . He was dead  --  dead to the world . " Ellery shrugged and resumed his pacing . " Which takes us back to the frogs . A cardboard box containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number one . Food poisoning ... that 's warning number two . Warning number three ... a zoo colony of dead frogs . One , unknown ; two , poisoned food ; three , strangled frogs . It certainly would help to know number one . " " Suppose it was a fried coconut , " suggested Keats . " Would it help ? " " There 's a connection , Lieutenant . A pattern . " " I 'm listening . " " You do n't just pick frogs out of your hat . Frogs mean something . " " Yeah , " said Keats , " warts . " But his laugh was unconvincing . " Okay , so they mean something . So this all means something . I do n't give a damn what it means . I said , what kind of maniac is this Priam ? Does he want to shove off ? Without putting up a battle ? " " He 's putting up a battle , Lieutenant , " frowned Ellery . " In his peculiar way , a brave one . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , would be defeat for Priam . Do n't you understand that ? He has to be top man . He has to control his own destiny . He has to , or his life has no meaning . Remember , Keats , he 's a man who 's living his life away in a chair . You say he 's asleep now ? " 98 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " With Wallace guarding him . I offered a cop , and I nearly got beaned with the Examiner . It was all I could do to make Priam promise he 'd keep his doors locked from now on . At that , he did n't promise . " How about that background stuff ? On the partners ? " The detective crushed the stained butt in his fist and flipped it in the fireplace . " It 's like pulling teeth , " he said slowly . " I do n't get it . I put two more men on it yesterday . " He snapped a fresh cigaret into his mouth . " The way I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of country constables . We 've got to go right to the horse 's mouth . Priam 's got to talk . He knows the whole story , every answer . Who his enemy is . Why the guy 's nursed a grudge for so many years . Why the fancy stuff  --  " " And what was in the box , " murmured Ellery . " Correct . I promised Dr. Voluta I 'd lay off Priam today . " Keats clapped his hat on his head . " But tomorrow I think I 'm going to get tough . " WHEN THE DETECTIVE had left , Ellery wandered out into the hall . The house was moody with silence . Crowe Macgowan had gone loping over to the Hill house to tell Laurel all about the amphibianinvasion . The door to Priam 's quarters was shut . There was no sign or sound of Delia . She was going to her room to lock herself in , she had said , and lie down . She had seemed to have no further interest in her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconsolately to go , but then  --  or perhaps he was looking for an excuse to linger  --  he remembered the library , and he went back up the hall to the doorway opposite Priam 's . Delia 's father sat at the library desk intently examining a postage stamp for its watermark . " Oh , Mr. Collier . " The old man looked up . Immediately he rose , smiling . " Come in , come in , Mr. Queen . Everything all right now ? " " Well , " said Ellery , " the frogs are no longer with us . " Collier shook his head . " Man 's inhumanity to everything . You'dTHE ORIGIN OF EVIL 99think we 'd restrict our murderous impulses to our own kind . But no , somebody had to take his misery out on some harmless little specimens of Hyla regilla , not to mention  --  " " Of what ? " asked Ellery . " Hyla regilla . Tree toads , Mr. Queen , or tree frogs . That 's what most of those little fellows were . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that any more . Although why a grown man like Roger Priam should be afraid of them  --  with their necks wrung , tool  --  I simply do n't understand . " " Mr. Collier , " said Ellery quietly , " have you any idea what this is all about ? " " Oh , yes , " said the old man . " I 'll tell you what this is all about , Mr. Queen . " He waved his stamp tongs earnestly . " It 's about corruptionand wickedness . It 's about greed and selfishness and guilt and violence and hatred and lack of self-control . It 's about black secrets and black hearts , cruelty , confusion , fear . It 's about not making the best of things , not being satisfied with what you have , and always wanting what you have n't . It 's about envy and suspicion and malice and lust and nosiness and drunkenness and unholy excitement and a thirst for hot running blood . It 's about man , Mr. morning Lieutenant Keats of the Hollywood Division put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the fate of the city of Los Angeles hung on Priam 's answers . And nothing happened except that Keats lost his temper and used some expressions not recommended in the police manual and had to retreat under a counterattack of even harder words , not to mention objects , which flew at him and Ellery like mortar fire . Priam quite stripped his wheelchair of its accessories in his furious search for ammunition . Overnight the bearded man had bounced back . Perhaps not all the way : his eyes looked shaft-sunken and he had a case of the trembles . But the old fires were in the depths and the shaking affected only his aim , not his strength  --  he made a bloodless shambles of his quarters . Keats had tried everything in ascending order  --  reason , cajolery , jokes , appeals to personal pride and social responsibility , derision , I00 THE ORIGIN OF EVILsarcasm , threats , curses , and finally sheer volume of sound . Nothing moved Priam but the threats and curses , and then he responded in kind . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that he had been out-threatened , out-cursed , and out-shouted . Through it all Alfred Wallace stood impeccably by his employer 's wheelchair , a slight smile on his lips . Mr. Wallace , too , had ricocheted . It occurred to Ellery that in Wallace 's make-up there was a great deal of old Collier 's Hyla regilla  --  a chameleon quality , changing color to suit his immediate background . Yesterday Priam had been unnerved , Wallace had been unnerved . Today Priam was strong , Wallace was strong . It was a minor puzzle , but it annoyed him . Then Ellery saw that he might be wrong and that the phenomenon might have a different explanation altogether . As he crossed the threshold to the echo of Priam 's last blast , with Wallace already shutting the door , Ellery glimpsed for one second a grotesquely differentPriam . No belligerent now . No man of wrath . His beard had fallen to his chest . He was holding on to the arms of his wheelchair as if for the reassurance of contact with reality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips moving ; and if the thought had not been blasphemous , Ellery would have said Priam was praying . Then Wallace slammed the door . " That was all right , Keats . " Ellery was staring at the door . " That got somewhere . " " Where ? " snarled the detective . " You heard him . He would n't say what was in the cardboard box , he would n't say who 's after him , he would n't say why  --  he would n't say anything but that he 'll handle this thing himself and let the blanking so-and-so come get him if he 's man enough . So where did we get , Mr. Queen ? " " Closer to the crackup . " " What crackup ? " " Priam 's . Keats , all that was the bellowing of a frightened steer in the dark . He 's even more demoralized than I thought . He played a big scene just now for our benefit  --  a very good one , considering the turmoil he 's in . " Maybe one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " SightLAUREL SAID THE frogs were very important . The enemy had slipped . So many hundreds of the warty beasts must have left a trail . All they had to do was pick it up . " What trail ? Pick it up where ? " demanded Macgowan . " Mac , where would you go if you wanted some frogs ? " " I would n't want some frogs . " " To a pet shop , of course ! " The giant looked genuinely admiring . " Why ca n't I think of things like that ? " he complained . " To a pet shop let us go . " But as the day wore on young Macgowan lost his air of levity . He began to look stubborn . And when even Laurel was ready to give up , Macgowan jeered , " Chicken ! " and drove on to the next shop on their list . As there are a great many pet emporia in Greater Los Angeles , and as Greater Los Angeles includes one hundred towns and thirty-six incorporated cities , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Monrovia east , it became apparent by the end of an endless day that the detective team of Hill and Macgowanhad assigned themselves an investigation worthy of their high purpose , if not their talents . " At this rate we 'll be at it till Christmas , " said Laurel in despair as they munched De Luxe Steerburgers at a drive-in in Beverly Hills . " You can give up , " growled Crowe , reaching for his Double-Dip Giant Malted . " Me , I 'm not letting a couple of hundred frogs throw me . I 'll go it alone tomorrow . " " I 'm not giving up , " snapped Laurel . " I was only going to say that we 've gone at this like the couple of amateurs we are . Let 's divide theIO2 THE ORIGIN OF EVILlist and split up tomorrow . That way we 'll cover twice the territory in the same time . " " Functional idea , " grunted the giant . " Now how about getting something to eat ? I know a good steak joint not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Early next morning they parceled the remaining territory and set out in separate cars , having arranged to meet at 6:3o in the parking lot next to Grauman 's Chinese . At 6:3o they met and compared notes while Hollywood honked its homeward way in every direction . Macgowan 's notes were dismal . " Not a damn lead , and I 've still got a list as long as your face . How about you ? " " One bite , " said Laurel gloomily . " I played a hunch and went over to a place in Encino . They even carry zoo animals . A man in Tarzana had ordered frogs . I tore over there and it turned out to be some movie star who 'd bought two dozen  --  he called them jug-o ' - rums '  --  for his rock pool . All I got out of it was an autograph , which I did n't ask for , and a date , which I turned down . " " What 's his name ? " snarled Crowe . " Oh , come off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as we 're in the neighborhood . " " What for ? " " Maybe he 'll have a suggestion . " " Let 's see what the Master has to say , hey ? " hissed her assistant . " Well , I wo n't wash his feet ! " He leaned on his horn all the way to the foot of the hill . When Laurel got out of her Austin , Crowe was already bashing Ellery 's door . " Open up , Queen ! What do you lock yourself in for ? " " Mac ? " came Ellery 's voice . " And Laurel , " sang out Laurel . " Just a minute . " When he unlocked the front door Ellery looked rumpled and heavy-eyed . " Been taking a nap , and Mrs. Williams must have gone . Come in . You two look like the shank end of a hard day . " " Brother , " scowled Macgowan . " Is there a tall , cool drink in this oasis ? " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL I03 " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bedroom door , which was closed . " I 'm afraid it 's in something of a mess , Laurel . Use the downstairs lavatory . . . Right over there , Mac . Help yourself .

" " You 've certainly covered a lot of territory , " applauded Ellery . " There are the fixings , Laurel  --  " " Oh , yes . " " You 'd think it would be easy , " the giant went on , waving his glass . " How many people buy frogs ? Practically nobody . Hardly one of the pet shops even handles ' em . Canaries , yes .

And I know now where you can buy an elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And toads  --  they just look at you as if you were balmy . " " Where did we go wrong ? " asked Laurel , perching on the arm of Crowe 's chair . " In not analyzing the problem before you dashed off . You 're not dealing with an idiot . Yes , you could get frogs through the ordinary channels , but they 'd be special orders , and special orders leave a trail . Our friend is not leaving any trails for your convenience . Did either of you think to call the State Fish and Game Commission ? " They stared . " If you had , " said Ellery with a smile , " you 'd have learned that most of the little fellows we found in Priam 's room are a small tree frog or tree toad  --  Hyla regilla is the scientific name  --  commonly called spring peepers , which are found in great numbers in this part of the country in streams and trees , especially in the foothills . You can even find bullfrogs here , though they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been introduced from the East . So if you wanted a lot of frogs and toads , and you did n't want to leave a trail , you 'd go out hunting for them . " " Two whole days , " groaned Macgowan . He gulped what was left in his glass . I04 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " It 's my fault , Mac , " said Laurel miserably . But then she perked up . " Well , it 's all experience . Next time we 'll know better . " " Next time he wo n't use frogs ! " " Mac . " Ellery was tapping his teeth with the bit of his pipe . " I 've been thinking about your grandfather . " " Is that good ? " Mac immediately looked bellicose . " Interesting man .

He 's gone on her and she 's the only reason he stays in Roger 's vicinity . And I 'm not gone on these questions , " said Crowe , looking at Ellery , " so let 's talk about somebody else , shall we ? " " Do n't you like your grandfather , Mac ? " " I love him ! Will you change the subject ? " " He collects stamps , " Ellery went on reflectively . " And he 's just taken to hunting and mounting butterflies .

" " No , " said Ellery , " you feel in all directions . That 's the first lesson you learn in this business . Your grandfather knew the scientific name of those spring peepers . It suggests that he may have gone into the subject . So I 'd like to know : In those long tramps he takes in the foothill woods , has he been collecting tree frogs ?

Oh , by the way , Laurel . " " Do I brace myself ? " murmured Laurel . " Well , " grinned Ellery , " I 'll admit my thoughts have sauntered in your direction too , Laurel . The first day you came to me you said you were Leander Hill 's daughter by adoption . " " Yes . " " And you said something about not remembering your mother .

" You 're equally divided between a bottom and a nose ! " " It does n't distress me , Ellery , " said Laurel with a rather unsuccessfulsmile . " I do n't know a thing about where I came from . I was one of those storybook babies  --  really left on a doorstep . Of course , Daddy had no right to keep me  --  a bachelor and all . But he hired a reliable woman and kept me for about a year before he even reported me . Then he had a lot of trouble . They took me away from him and there was a long court squabble . But in the end they could n't find out a thing about me , nobody claimed me , and he won out in court and was allowed to make it a legal adoption . I do n't remember any of that , of course .

" " Of course , but  --  " " You do n't know me . " Laurel laughed . " No , I do n't . " Ellery tamped his pipe absently . " But one possible explanation is that the underlying motivation of your drive is not revenge on a murderer at all , but the desire to find yourself . It could be that you 're nursing a subconscious hope that finding this killer will somehow clear up the mystery of your own background . " " I never thought of that .

" WHEN THEY HAD gone , Ellery opened his bedroom door and said , " All right , Delia . " " I thought they 'd never go . " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL I07 " I 'm afraid it was my fault . I kept them . " " You wanted to punish me for hiding . " " Maybe . " He waited . " I like it here , " she said slowly , looking around at the pedestrian blond furniture . She was seated on his bed , hands gripping the spread . She had not taken her hat off , or her gloves . She must have sat that way all during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hanging in midair . Like her probable excuse for leaving the Priam house . A visit somewhere in town . Among the people who wore hats and gloves . " Why do you feel you have to hide , Delia ? " " It 's not so messy that way . No explanations to give . No lies to make up . No scenes . I hate scenes . " She seemed much more interested in the house than in him . " A man who lives alone . I can hardly imagine it . " Why did you come again ? " " I do n't know . I just wanted to . " She laughed . " You do n't sound any more hospitable this time than you did the last . I 'm not very quick , but I 'm beginning to think you do n't like me . " He said brutally , " When did you get the idea that I did ? " " Oh , the first couple of times we met . " " That was barnyard stuff , Delia . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what 's your attitude now ? " She laughed again . " That you do n't feel like a rooster any more ? " " I 'll be glad to answer that question , Delia , in the living room . " Her head came up sharply . " You do n't have to answer any questions , " she said . She got up and strolled past him . " In your living room or anywhere else . " As he shut the bedroom door and turned to her , she said , " You really do n't like me ? " almost wistfully . " I like you very much , Delia . That 's why you must n't come here . " " But you just said in there  --  " " That was in there . " She nodded , but not as if she really understood . She went to hisIo8 THE ORIGIN OF EVILdesk , ignoring the mirror above it , and picked up one of his pipes . She stroked it with her forefinger . He concentrated on her hands , the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . " Delia  --  " " Are n't you ever lonely ? " she murmured . " I think I die a little every day , just from loneliness . Nobody who talks to you really talks . It 's just words . People listening to themselves . Women hate me , and men . . . At least when they talk to me ! " She wheeled , crying , " Am I that stupid ? You wo n't talk to me , either ! Am I ? " He had to make the effort over again . It was even harder this time . But he said through his teeth , " Delia , I want you to go home . " " Why ? " " Just because you 're lonely , and have a husband who 's half-dead  --  in the wrong half  --  and because I 'm not a skunk , Delia , and you 're not a tramp . Those are the reasons , Delia , and if you stay here much longer I 'm afraid I 'll forget all four of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The top of his head flew off and he felt his shoulderblades smack against the wall . Through a momentary mist he saw her in the doorway . " I 'm sorry , " she said in an agonized way . " You 're a fool , but I 'm sorry . I mean about coming here . I wo n't do it again . " Ellery watched her go down the hill . There was fog , and she disappeared in it . That night he finished most of a bottle of Scotch , sitting at the picture window in the dark and fingering his jaw . The fog had come higher and there was nothing to see but a chaos . Nothing made sense . But he felt purged , and safe , and wryly noble . JUNE TWENTY-NINTH WAS a Los Angeles special . The weather man reported a reading of ninety-one and the newspapers bragged that the city was having its warmest June twentyninthin forty-three years . But Ellery , trudging down Hollywood Boulevard in a wool jacket , was hardly aware of the roasting desert heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dream entirely filled with the pieces of the HillPriamproblem . So far it was a meaningless dream in which he mentally chased cubist things about a crazy landscape . In that dimensiontemperature did not exist except on the thermometer of frustration . Keats had phoned to say that he was ready with the results of his investigation into the past of Hill and Priam . Well , it was about time . Ellery turned south into Wilcox , passing the post office . You could drift about in your head for just so long recognizing nothing . There came a point at which you had to find a compass and a legible map or go mad . This ought to be it . HE FOUND KEATS tormenting a cigaret , the knot of his tie on his sternum and his sandy hair bristling . " I thought you 'd never get here . " " I walked down . " Ellery took a chair , settling himself . " Well , let 's have it . " " Where do you want it , " asked the detective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " Ellery straightened . " I mean , " said Keats , plucking shreds of tobacco from his lips  --  IIO THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " damn it , they pack cigarets looser all the time !  --  I mean we have n't got a crumb . " " A crumb of what ? " " Of information . " " You have n't found out anything ? " Ellery was incredulous . " Nothing before 1927 , which is the year Hill and Priam went into business in Los Angeles . There 's nothing that indicates they lived here before that year ; in fact , there 's reason to believe they did n't , that they came here that year from somewhere else . But from where ? No data . We 've tried everything from tax records to the Central Bureau fingerprint files . I 'm pretty well convinced they had no criminal record , but that 's only a guess . They certainly had no record in the State of California . " They came here in ' 27 , " said Keats bitterly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a fortune before the crash of ' 29 . They were n't committed to the market and they rode out the depression by smart manipulation and original merchandising methods . Today the firm of Hill &; Priam is rated one of the big outfits in its line . They 're said to own one of the largest stocks of precious stones in the United States . And that 's a lot of help , is n't it ? " " But you do n't come into the wholesale jewelry business from outer space , " protested Ellery . " Is n't there a record somewhere of previous connections in the industry ? At least of one of them ? " " The N.J.A. records do n't show anything before 1927 . " " Well , have you tried this ? Certainly Hill , at least , had to go abroad once in a while in connection with the firm 's foreign offices  --  Laurel told me they have branches in Amsterdam and South Africa . That means a passport , a birth certificate  --  " " That was my ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his lips . " But it turns out that Hill &; Priam do n't own those branches , although they do own the one in New York . They 're simply working arrangements with established firms abroad . They have large investmentsin those firms , but all their business dealings have been , and still are , negotiated by and through agents . There 's no evidence that either Hill or Priam stepped off American soil in twenty-three years , or at least during the twenty-three years we have a record of them . " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL IIIHe shrugged . " They opened the New York branch early in 1929 , and for a few years Priam took care of it personally . But it was only to get it going and train a staff . He left it in charge of a man who 's still running it there , and came back here . Then Priam met and married Delia Collier Macgowan , and the next thing that happened to him was the paralysis . Hill did the transcontinental hopping for the firm after that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth certificate ? " " No , and in his condition there 's no likelihood he ever will . He 's never voted , for instance , and while he might be challenged to prove his American citizenship  --  to force him to loosen up about his place of birth and so on  --  I 'm afraid that would take a long , long time . Too long for this merry-go-round . " " The war  --  " " Both Priam and Hill were over the military age limit when World War II conscription began . They never had to register . Search of the records on World War I failed to turn up their names . " " You 're beginning to irritate me , Lieutenant . Did n't Leander Hill carry any insurance ? " " None that antedated 1927 , and in the photostats connected with what insurance he did take out after that date his place of birth appearsas Chicago . I 've had the Illinois records checked , and there 's none of a Leander Hill ; it was a phony . Priam carries no insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , is no help . " In other words , Mr. Queen , " said Lieutenant Keats , " there 's every indication that both men deliberately avoided leaving , or camouflaged , the trail to their lives preceding their appearance in L.A. It all adds up to one thing  --  " " That there was no Leander Hill or Roger Priam in existence before 1927 , " muttered Ellery . " Hill and Priam were n't their real names . " " That 's it . " Ellery got up and went to the window . Through the glass , darkly , he saw the old landscape again . " Lieutenant . " He turned suddenly . " Did you check Roger Priam 's paralysis ? " Keats smiled . " Got quite a file on that if you want to read a lot of medical mumbo jumbo . The sources are some of the biggestII2 THE ORIGIN OF EVILspecialists in the United States . But if you want it in plain American shorthand , his condition is on the level and it 's hopeless . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Priam about his previous medical history , if that 's what you had in mind . " " You 're disgustingly thorough , Keats . I wish I could find the heart to congratulate you . Now tell me you could n't find anything on Alfred Wallace and I 'll crown you . " Keats picked up an inkstand and offered it to Ellery . " Start crowning . " " Nothing on Wallace either ? " " That 's right . " Keats spat little dry sprigs of tobacco . " All I could dig up about Mr. Alfred W. dates from the day Priam hired him , just over a year ago . " " Why , that ca n't be ! " exploded Ellery . " Not three in the same case . " " He 's not an Angeleno , I 'm pretty well convinced of that . But I ca n't tell you what he is . I 'm still working on it . " " But . . . it 's such a short time ago , Keats ! " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigaret , " you wish you were back in New York among the boys in the big league . Just the same , there 's something screwy about Wallace , too . And I thought , Mr. Queen , having so little to cheer you up with today , I 'd cut out the fancy stuff and try a smash through the center of the line . I have n't talked to Wallace . How about doing it now ? " " You 've got him here ? " exclaimed Ellery . " Waiting in the next room . Just a polite invitation to come down to the station here and have a chat . He did n't seem to mind  --  said it was his day off anyway . I 've got one of the boys keeping him from getting bored . " Ellery pulled a chair into a shadowed corner of the office and snapped , " Produce . " ALFRED WALLACE CAME in with a smile , the immaculate man unaffected by the Fahrenheit woes of lesser mortals . His white hair had a foaming wave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small purple aster in his lapel . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL I13 " Mr. Queen , " said Wallace pleasantly . " So you 're the reason LieutenantKeats has kept me waiting over an hour . " " I 'm afraid so . " Ellery did not rise . But Keats was polite . " Sorry about that , Mr. Wallace . Here , have this chair . . . But you ca n't always time yourself in a murder in-vestigation . " " You mean what may be a murder investigation , Lieutenant , " said Wallace , seating himself , crossing his legs , and setting his hat preciselyon his knee . " Or has something new come up ? " " Something new could come up , Mr. Wallace , if you 'll answer a few questions . " " Me ? " Wallace raised his handsome brows . " Is that why you 've placed this chair where the sun hits my face ? " He seemed amused . Keats silently pulled the cord of the Venetian blind . " Thanks , Lieutenant . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , of course , I can . " " I do n't think you 'll have any trouble answering this one , Mr. Wallace : Where do you come from ? " " Ah . " Wallace looked thoughtful . " Now that 's just the kind of question , Lieutenant , I ca n't answer . " " You mean you wo n't answer . " " I mean I ca n't answer . " " You do n't know where you come from , I suppose . " " Exactly . " " If that 's going to be Mr. Wallace 's attitude , " said Ellery from his corner , " I think we can terminate the interview . " " You misunderstand me , Mr. Queen . I 'm not being obstructive . " Wallace sounded earnest . " I ca n't tell you gentlemen where I come from because I do n't know myself . I 'm one of those interesting cases you read about in the papers . An amnesia victim . " Keats glanced at Ellery . Then he rose . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not all , Lieutenant . This is n't something I ca n't prove . In fact , now that you 've brought it up , I insist on proving it . You 're making a recording of this , of course ? I would like this to go into the record . " Keats waved his hand . His eyes were intent and a little admiring . I14 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " One day about a year and a half ago  --  the exact date was January the sixteenth of last year  --  I found myself in Las Vegas , Nevada , on a street corner , " said Alfred Wallace calmly . " I had no idea what my name was , where I came from , how I had got there . I was dressed in filthy clothing which did n't fit me and I was rather banged up . I looked through my pockets and found nothing  --  no wallet , no letters , no identification of any kind . There was no money , not even coins . I went up to a policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he took me to a police station . They asked me questions and had a doctor in to examine me . The doctor 's name was Dr. James V. Cutbill , and his address was 515 North Fifth Street , Las Vegas . Have you got that , Lieutenant ? " Dr. Cutbill said I was obviously a man of education and good background , about fifty years old or possibly older . He said it looked like amnesia to him . I was in perfect physical condition , and from my speech a North American . Unfortunately , Dr. Cutbill said , there were no identifying marks of any kind on my body and no operation scars , though he did say I 'd had my tonsils and adenoids out probably as a child . This , of course , was no clue . There were some fillings in my teeth , of good quality , he thought , but I 'd had no major dental work done . The police photographed me and sent my picture and a description to all Missing Persons Bureaus in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lieutenant Keats . " Keats grew fiery red . " I 'll check that , " he growled . " And lots more . " " I 'm sure you will , Lieutenant , " said Wallace with a smile . " The Las Vegas police fixed me up with some clean clothes and found me a job as a handyman in a motel , where I got my board and a place to sleep , and a few dollars a week . The name of the motel is the 711 , on Route 91 just north of town . I worked there for about a month , saving my pay . The Las Vegas police told me no one of my description was listed as missing anywhere in the country . So I gave up the job and hitchhiked into California . " In April of last year I found myself in Los Angeles . I stayed at the Y , the Downtown Branch on South Hope Street ; I ' ' m surprised you did n't run across my name on their register , Lieutenant , or haven'tTHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I got busy looking for employment . I 'd found out I could operate a typewriter and knew shorthand , that I was good at figures  --  apparently I 'd had business training of some sort as well as a rather extensive education  --  and when I saw an ad for a secretarial companion-nurse job to an incapacitated businessman , I answered it . I told Mr. Priam the whole story , just as I 've told it to you . It seems he 'd been having trouble keeping people in recent years and , after checking back on my story , he took me on for a month 's trial . And here , " said Wallace with the same smile , " here I am , still on the job . " " Priam took you on without references ? " said Keats , doodling . " How desperate was he ? " " As desperate as he could be , Lieutenant . And then Mr. Priam prides himself on being a judge of character . I was really glad of that , because to this day I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellery lit a cigaret . Wallace watched the flame of the match critically . When Ellery blew the flame out , Wallace smiled again . But immediately Ellery said , " How did you come to take the name Alfred Wallace if you remembered nothing about your past ? Or did you remember that ? " " No , it 's just a name I plucked out of the ether , Mr. Queen . Alfred , Wallace  --  they 're very ordinary names and more satisfying than john Doe . Lieutenant Keats , are n't you going to check my story ? " " It 's going to be checked , " Keats assured him . " And I 'm sure we 'll find it happened exactly as you 've told it , Wallace  --  dates , names , and places . The only thing is , it 's all a dodge . That 's something I feel in my bones . As one old bone-feeler to another , Mr. Queen , how about it ? " " Did this doctor in Las Vegas put you under hypnosis ? " Ellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Queen . He was just a general practitioner . " " Have you seen any other doctor since ? A psychiatrist , for ex-ample ? " " No , I have n't . " " Would you object to being examined by a psychiatrist of  --  let 's say  --  Lieutenant Keats 's choosing ? " I16 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " I 'm afraid I would , Mr. Queen , " murmured Wallace . " You sec , I 'm not sure I want to find out who I really am . I might discover , for example , that I 'm an escaped thief , or that I have a bowlegged wife and five idiot children somewhere . I 'm perfectly happy where I am . Of course , Roger Priam is n't the easiest employer in the world , but the job has its compensations . I 'm living in royal quarters . The salary Priam pays me is very large  --  he 's a generous employer , one of his few virtues . Old , fat Mrs. Guittierez is an excellent cook , and even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halitosis who 's taken an unreasonable dislike to me , she does keep my room clean and polishes my shoes regularly . And the position even solves the problem of my sex life  --  oh , I should n't have mentioned that , should I ? " Wallacelooked distressed ; he waved his muscular hand gently . " A slip of the tongue , gentlemen . I do hope you 'll forget I said it . " Keats was on his feet . Ellery heard himself saying , " Wallace . Just what did you mean by that ? " " A gentleman , Mr. Queen , could n't possibly have the bad taste to pursue such a question . " " A gentleman could n't have made the statement in the first place . I ask you again , Wallace : How does your job with Priam take care of your sex life ? " Wallace looked pained . He glanced up at Keats . " Lieutenant , must I answer that question ? " Keats said slowly , " You do n't have to answer anything . You brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a damn about your sex life unless it has something to do with this case . If it has , you 'd better answer it . " " It has n't , Lieutenant . How could it have ? " " I would n't know . " " Answer the question , " said Ellery in a pleasant voice . " Mr. Queen seems more interested than you , Lieutenant . " " Answer the question , " said Ellery in a still pleasanter voice . Wallace shrugged . " All right . But you 'll bear witness , Lieutenant Keats , that I 've tried my best to shield the lady in the case . " He raised his eyes suddenly to Ellery and Ellery saw the smile in them , a wintry shimmer . " Mr. Queen , I have the great good luck to share my employTHEORIGIN OF EVIL 117er 's wife 's bed . As the spirit moves . And the flesh being weak , and Mrs. Priam being the most attractive piece I 've yet seen in this glorious state , I must admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so for about a year . Does that answer your question ? " " Just a minute , Wallace , " Ellery heard Keats say . And Keats was standing before him , between him and Wallace . Keats was saying in a rapid whisper , " Queen , look , let me take it from here on in . Why do n't you get out of here ? " " Why should I ? " Ellery said clearly . Keats did not move . But then he straightened up and stepped aside . " You 're lying , of course , " Ellery said to Wallace . " You 're counting on the fact that no decent man could ask a decent woman a question like that , and so your lie wo n't be exposed . I do n't know what slimy purpose your lie serves , but I 'm going to step on it right now . Keats , hand me that phone . " And all the time he was speaking Ellery knew it was true . He had known it was true the instant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amnesia was true only so far as the superficial facts went ; Wallace had prepared a blind alley for himself , using the Las Vegas police and a mediocre doctor to seal up the dead end . But this was all true . He knew it was all true and he could have throttled the man who sat halfway across the room smiling that iced smile . " I do n't see that that would accomplish anything , " Keats was saying . " She 'd only deny it . It would n't prove a thing . " " He 's lying , Keats . " Wallace said with delicate mockery , " I 'm happy to hear you take that attitude , Mr. Queen . Of course . I 'm lying . May I go , Lieutenant ? " " No , Wallace . " Keats stuck his jaw out . " I 'm not letting it get this far without knowing the whole story . You say you 've been cuckolding Priam for almost a year now . Is Delia Priam in love with you ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's the same thing with Delia that it is with me . A matter of convenience . " " But it stopped some time ago , did n't it ? " Keats had a wink in his voice ; man-to-man stuff . " It 's not still going on . " " Certainly it 's still going on . Why should it have stopped ? " Keats 's shoulders bunched . " You must feel plenty proud of yourIIg THEORIGIN OF EVILself , Wallace . Eating a man 's food , guzzling his liquor , taking his dough , and sleeping with his wife while he 's helpless in a wheelchair on the floor below . A cripple who could n't give you what you rate even if he knew what was going on . " " Oh , did n't I make that clear , Lieutenant ? " said Alfred Wallace , smiling . " Priam does know what 's going on . In fact , looking back , I can see that he engineered the whole thing . " " What are you giving me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of man Priam is . And I think you ought to know the facts of life about Priam , since it 's his life you 're knocking yourselves out to save . " Wallace ran his thumb tenderly around the brim of his hat . " I do n't deny that I did n't figure Priam right myself in the beginning , when Delia and I first got together . I sneaked it , naturally . But Delia laughed and told me not to be a fool , that Priam knew , that he wanted it that way . Although he 'd never admit it or let on  --  to me , or to her . " Well , " said Wallace modestly . " Of course I thought she was kidding me . But then I began to notice things . Looks in his eye . The way he kept pushing us together . That sort of thing . So I did a little investigating on the quiet . " I found out that in picking secretaries Priam had always hired particularly virile-looking men . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job  --  how he kept looking me over , like a horse . " Wallace took a cigar from his pocket and lit it . Puffing with enjoyment , he leaned back . " Frankly , I 've been too embarrassed to put the question to Delia directly . But unless I 'm mistaken , and I do n't think I am , Priam 's secretaries have always done double duty . Well , for the last ten years , anyway . It also explains the rapid turnover . Not every man is as virile as he looks , " Wallace said with a laugh , " and then there are always some mushy-kneed lads who 'd find a situation like that uncomfortable . But the fact remains . Priam 's hired men to serve not only the master of the house , you might say , but the mistress too . " " Get him out of here , " Ellery said to Keats . But to his surprise no words came out . " Roger Priam , " continued Alfred Wallace , waving his cigar , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and frustration . The clue to his character  --  and , gentlemen , I 've had ample opportunity to judge it  --  is his compulsive need to dominate everything and everyone around him . He tried to dominate old Leander Hill through the farce of pretending he , Roger Priam , was running a million-dollar business from a wheelchair at home . He tried to dominate Crowe Macgowan before Crowe got too big for him , according to Delia . And he 's always dominated Delia , who does n't care enough about anything to put up a scrap  --  dominated her physically until he became paralyzed , Delia 's told me , with the most incredible vulgarities and brutalities . " Now imagine , " murmured Wallace , " what paralysis from the waist down did to Priam 's need to dominate his woman . Physically he was no longer a man . And his wife was beautiful ; to this day every male who meets her begins strutting like a bull . Priam knew , knowing Delia , that it was only a question of time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he be ? He might not even know about it . It would be entirely out of his control . Unthinkable ! So Priam worked out the solution in his warped way  --  to dominate Delia by proxy . " By God , imagine that ! He deliberately picks a virile man  --  the substitute for himself physically and psychologically  --  and flings them at each other 's heads , letting nature take its course . " Wallace flicked an ash into the tray on Keats 's desk . " I used to think he 'd taken a leaf out of Faulkner 's Sanctuary , or Krafft-Ebing , except that I 've come to doubt if he 's read a single book in forty-five years . No , Priam could n't explain all this  --  to himself least of all . He 's an ignorant man ; he would n't even know the words . Like so many ignorantmen , he 's a man of pure action . He throws his wife and handpickedsecretary together , thus performing the function of a husband vicariously , and by pretending to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he retains his mastery of the situation . He 's the god of the machine , gentlemen , and there is no other god but Roger Priam . That is , to Roger Priam . " Wallace blew a fat ring of cigar smoke and rose . " And now , unless there 's something else , Lieutenant , I 'd like to salvage what 's left of my day off . " Keats said in a loud voice , " Wallace , you 're a fork-tongued femaleI20 THE ORIGIN OF EVILof a mucking liar . I do n't believe one snicker of this dirty joke . And when I prove you 're a liar , Wallace , I 'm going to leave my badge home with my wife and kids , and I 'm going to haul you into some dark alley , and I 'm going to kick the out of you . " Wallace 's smile thinned . His face reassembled itself and looked suddenly old . He reached over Keats 's desk and picked  --  up the telephone . " Here , " he said , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to get the number for you ? " " Scram . " " But you want proof . Delia will admit it if you ask her in the right way , Lieutenant . Delia 's a very civilized woman . " " Get out . " Wallace laughed . He replaced the phone gently , adjusted his fashionablehat on his handsome head , and walked out humming . KEATS INSISTED ON driving Ellery home . The detective drove slowly through the five o'clock traffic . Neither man said anything . He had seen them for that moment in the Priam hallway , the day he had come at her summons to investigate the plague of dead frogs . Wallace had been standing close to her , far closer than a man stands to a woman unless he knows he will not be repulsed . And she had not repulsed him . She had stood there accepting his pressure while Wallacesqueezed her hand and whispered in her ear . . . He rememberedone or two of Wallace 's glances at her , the glances of a man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I always take the line of least resistance . . . " He remembered the night she had hidden herself in his bedroom at the sound of her son 's and Laurel 's arrival . She had come to him that night for the purpose to which her life in the Priam house had accustomed her . Probably she had a prurient curiosity about " celebrities " or she was tired of Wallace . ( And this was Wallace 's revenge ? ) He would have read the signs of the nymph easily enough if he had not mistaken her flabbiness for reserve  --  " We 're here , Mr. Queen , " Keats was saying . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL I2IThey were at the cottage . " Oh . Thanks . " Ellery got out automatically . " Good night . " Keats failed to drive away . Instead he said , " Is n't that your phone ringing ? " " Yes . Why does n't Mrs. Williams answer it ? " Ellery said with irritation . Then he laughed . " She is n't answering it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in . " " Wait . " Keats turned his motor off and vaulted to the road . " Maybe it 's my office . I told them I might be here . " Ellery unlocked the front door and went in . Keats straddled the threshold . " Hello ? " Keats saw him stiffen . " Yes , Delia . " Ellery listened in silence . Keats heard the vibration of the throaty tones , faint and warm and humid . " Keats is with me now . Hide it till we get there , Delia . We 'll be right over . " Ellery hung up . " What does the lady want ? " asked Keats . " She says she 's just found another cardboard box . It was in the Priam mailbox on the road , apparently left there a short time ago . Priam 's name handprinted on it . She has n't told Priam about it , asked what she ought to do . You heard what I told her . " " Another warning ! " Keats ran for his car. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they got out and walked slowly toward it , examining the road . There were tire marks in profusion , illegibly intermingled . Near the box they found several heelmarks of a woman 's shoe , but that was all . The door of the box hung open and the box was empty . They walked up the driveway to the house . Keats neither rang nor knocked . The maid with the tic came hurrying toward them as he closed the door . " Mrs. Priam said to come upstairs , " she whispered . " To her room . " She glanced over her shoulder at the closed door of Roger Priam 's den . " And not to make any noise , she said , because he 's got ears like a dog . " " All right , " said Keats . Muggs fled on tiptoe . The two men stood there until she had disappearedbeyond the swinging door at the rear of the hall . Then they went upstairs , hugging the balustrade . As they reached the landing , a door opposite the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Delia Priam shut the door swiftly and sank back against it . She was in brief tight shorts and a strip of sun halter . Her thighs were long and heavy and swelled to her trunk ; her breasts spilled over the halter . The glossy black hair lay carelessly piled ; she was barefoot  --  her high-heeled shoes had been kicked off . The rattan blinds were down and in the gloom her pale eyes glowed sleepily . Keats looked her over deliberately . " Hello , Ellery . " She sounded relieved . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 123 " Hello , Delia . " There was nothing in his voice , nothing at all . " Do n't you think you 'd better put something on , Mrs. Priam ? " said Keats . " Any other time this would be a privilege and a pleasure , but we 're here on business . " He grinned with his lips only . " I do n't think I could think . " She glanced down at herself , startled . " I 'm sorry , Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked down to the road . I 'm very sorry . " She sounded angry and a little puzzled . " No harm done , Delia , " said Ellery . " This sort of thing is all in the eye of the beholder . " She glanced at him quickly . A frown appeared between her heavy brows . " Is something wrong , Ellery ? " He looked at her . The color left her face . Her hands went to her naked shoulders and she hurried past them into a dressing room , slamming the door . " Bitch , " said Keats pleasantly . He took a cigaret out of his pocket and jammed it between his lips . The end tore and he spat it out , turning away . Ellery looked around . The room was overpowering , with dark Spanish furniture and wallpaper and drapes which flaunted masses of great tropical flowers . The rug was a sullen Polynesian red with a two-inch pile . There were cushions and hassocks of unusual shapes and colors . Huge majolicas stood about filled with lilies . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large black iron crucifix that looked very old . Niches were crowded with ceramics , woodcarvings , metal sculpturesof exotic subjects , chiefly modern in style and many of them male nudes . There was an odd bookshelf hanging by an iron chain , and Ellery strolled over to it , his legs brushing the bed . Thomas Aquinas , Kinsey , Bishop Berkeley , Pierre Loti , Havelock Ellis . Lives of the Saints and Fanny Hill in a Paris edition . The rest were mystery stories ; there was one of his , his latest . The bed was a wide and herculean piece set low to the floor , covered with a cloth-of-gold spread appliqued , in brilliant colors of metallic thread , with a vast tree of life . In the ceiling , directly above the bed and of identical dimensions , glittered a mirror framed in fluorescent tubing. 124 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " For some reason , " remarked Lieutenant Keats in the silence , " this reminds me of that movie actor , What's-His-Name , of the old silent days . In the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit fur . " The dressing room door opened and Keats said , " Now that 's a relief , Mrs. Priam . Thanks a lot . Where 's this box ? " She went to a trunk-sized teak chest covered with brasswork chased intricately in the East Indian manner , which stood at the foot of the bed , and she opened it . She had put on a severe brown linen dress and stockings as well as flat-heeled shoes ; she had combed her hair back in a knot . She was pale and frigid , and she looked at neither man . She took out of the chest a white cardboard box about five inches by nine and an inch deep , bound with ordinary white string , and handed it to Keats . " Have you opened this , Mrs. Priam ? " " No . " " Then you do n't know what 's in it ? " " No . " " You found it exactly where and how , again ? " " In our mailbox near the road . I 'd gone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed ' it was open . I looked in and saw this . I took it upstairs , locked it in my chest , and phoned . " The box was of cheap quality . It bore no imprint . To the string was attached a plain Manila shipping tag . The name " Roger Priam " was lettered on the tag in black crayon , in carefully characterless capitals . " Dime store stock , " said Keats , tapping the box with a fingernail . He examined the tag . " And so is this . " " Delia . " At the sound of his voice she turned , but when she saw his expression she looked away . " You saw the box your husband received the morning Hill got the dead dog . Was it like this ? In quality , kind of string , tag ? " " Yes . The box was bigger , that 's all . " There was a torn edge to the furry voice . " No dealer 's imprint ? " " No . " " Does the lettering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tag ? " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL I25 " It looks just like it . " She put her hand on his arm suddenly , but she was looking at Keats . " Lieutenant , I 'd like to speak to Mr. Queen privately for a minute . " " I do n't have any secrets from Keats . " Ellery was glancing down at his arm . " Please ? " Keats walked over to one of the windows with the box . He lifted the blind , squinting along the slick surface of the box . " Ellery , is it what happened the other night ? " Her voice was at its throatiest , very low . " Nothing happened the other night . " " Maybe that 's the trouble . " She laughed . " But a great deal has happened since . " She stopped laughing . " What do you mean ? " He shrugged . " Ellery . Who 's been telling you lies about me ? " Ellery glanced again at her hand . " It 's my experience , Delia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it expressed is to admit it 's all too true . " He took her hand between his thumb and forefinger as if it were something sticky , and he dropped it . Then he turned his back on her . Keats had the box to his ear and he was shaking it with absorption . Something inside rustled slightly . He hefted the box . " Nothing loose . Sounds like a solid object wrapped in tissue paper . And not much weight . " He glanced at the woman . " I do n't have any right to open this , Mrs. Priam . But there 's nothing in the statutes to stop you . . . here and now . " " I would n't untie that string , Lieutenant Keats , " said Delia Priam in a trembling voice , " for all the filth in your mind . " " What did I do ? " Keats raised his reddish brows as he handed the box to Ellery . " That puts it up to you , Mr. Queen . What do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bedroom ! " Ellery said , " I 'll open it , Keats , but not here . And not now . I think this ought to be opened before Roger Priam , with Mrs. Priam there , and Laurel Hill , too . " I26 THE ORIGIN OF EVIL " You can get along without me , " she whispered . " Get out . " " It 's important for you to be there , " Ellery said to her . " You ca n't tell me what to do . " " In that case I 'll have to ask the assistance of someone who can . " " No one can . " " Not Wallace ? " smiled Ellery . " Or one of his numerous predeces-sors ? " Delia Priam sank to the chest , staring . " Come on , Keats . We 've wasted enough time in this stud pasture . " LAUREL WAS OVER in ten minutes , looking intensely curious . Padding after her into the cavelike gloom of the house came the man of the future . Young Macgowan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter now ? " he inquired plaintively . No one replied . By a sort of instinct , he put a long arm about his mother and kissed her . Delia smiled up at him anxiously , and when he straightened she kept her grasp on his big hand . Macgowan seemed puzzled by the atmosphere . He fixed on Keats as the cause , and he glared murderouslyfrom the detective to the unopened box . " Loosen up , boy , " said Keats . " Tree life is getting you . Okay , Mr. Queen ? " " Yes . " Young Macgowan did n't know . Laurel knew  --  Laurel had known for a long time  --  but Delia 's son was wrapped in the lamb 's wool of mother-adoration . I 'd hate to be the first one , Ellery thought , to tell him . As for Laurel , she had glanced once at Delia and once at Ellery , and she had become mousy . Ellery waited on the threshold to the hall as Keats explained about the box . " It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as on the dead dog , " Laurel said . She eyed the box grimly . " What 's inside ? " " We 're going to find that out right now . " Ellery took the box from Keats and they all followed him up the hall to Priam 's door . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 127 " Furl your mains ' ! , " said a voice . It was old Mr. Collier , in the doorwayacross the hall . " Mr. Collier . Would you care to join us ? There 's something new . " " I 'll sit up in the rigging , " said Delia 's father . " Has n't there been enough trouble ? " " We 're trying to prevent trouble , " said Keats mildly . " So you go looking for it . Does n't make sense to me , " said the old man , shaking his head . " Live and let live . Or die and let die . If it 's right one way , it 's right the other . " He stepped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's door . It was locked . He rapped loudly . " Who is it ? " The bull voice sounded slurry . Ellery said , " Delia , you answer him . " She nodded mechanically . " Roger , open the door , wo n't you ? " She sounded passive , almost bored . " Delia ? What d'ye want ? " They heard the trundling of his chair and some glassy sounds . " Damn this rug ! I 've told Alfred a dozen times to tack it down  --  " The door opened and he stared up at them . The shelf before him supported a decanter of whisky , a siphon , and a half empty glass . His eyes were bloodshot . " What 's this ? " he snarled at Ellery . " I thought I told you two to clear out of my house and stay out . " His fierce eyes lighted on the box in Ellery 's hand . They contracted , and he looked up and around . His glance passed over his wife and stepson as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face for a moment with a hatred so concentrated that Crowe Macgowan made an unconscious growling sound . Laurel 's lips tightened . He put out one of his furry paws . " Give me the box . " " No , Mr. Priam . " " That tag 's got my name on it . Give it to me ! " " I 'm sorry , Mr. Priam . " He raised the purplish ensign of his rage , his eyes flaming . " You ca n't keep another man 's property ! " " I have no intention of keeping it , Mr. Priam . I merely want to see what 's inside . Wo n't you please back into the room so that we can come in and do this like civilized people ? " Ellery kept looking at him impassively . Priam glared back , but hisI28 THE ORIGIN OF EVILhands went to the wheels of his chair . Grudgingly , they pushed backwards . Keats shut the door very neatly . Then he put his back against it . He remained there , watching Priam . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hurry . Priam 's hands were still at the sides of his chair . He was sitting forward , giving his whole attention to the untying process . His beard rose and fell with his chest . The purple flag had come down , leaving a sort of gray emptiness , like a foggy sky . Laurel was intent . Young Macgowan kept shifting from foot to naked foot , uneasily . Delia Priam stood perfectly still . " Lieutenant , " said Ellery suddenly , as he worked over the last knot , " what do you suppose we 'll find in here ? " Keats said , " After those dead frogs I would n't stick my chin out . " He kept looking at Priam . " Do you have to take out the knots ? " cried Crowe . " Open it ! " " Would anyone care to guess ? " " Please . " Laurel , begging . " Mr. Priam ? " Priam never stirred . Only his lips moved , and the beard around them . But nothing came out . Ellery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost upsetting the chair . Then , conscious of their shock , he fumbled for the glass of whisky . He tilted his head , drinking , not taking his glance from the box . All that had been exposed was a layer of white tissue . " From the way you jumped , Mr. Priam , " said Ellery conversationally , " anyone would think you expected a hungry rattler to pop out at you , or something equally live and disagreeable . What is it you 're afraid of ? " Priam set the glass down with a bang . His knuckles were livid . " I ai n't afraid , " he spluttered . " Of anything ! " His chest spread . " Stop needling me , you ! Or I swear  --  " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL I29He brought his arm up blindly . It struck the decanter and the decanter toppled from the shelf , smashing on the floor . Ellery was holding the object high , stripped of its tissue wrapping . He held it by its edges , between his palms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because there was nothing in what he was displaying to make a man cringe . It was simply a wallet , a man 's wallet of breast pocket size made of alligator leather , beautifully grained and dyed forest green . There were no hideous stains on it ; it had no history ; it was plainly brandnew . And high-priced ; it was edged in gold . Ellery flipped it open . Its pockets were empty . There had been no note or card in the box . " Let me see that , " said Keats . Nothing to make a man cower , or a woman grow pale . " No initials , " said Keats . " Nothing but the maker 's name . " He scratched his cheek , glancing at Priam again . " What is it , Lieutenant ? " asked Laurel . " What is what , Miss Hill ? " " The maker 's name . " " Leatherland , Inc. , Hollywood , California . " Priam 's beard had sunk to his chest . Paler than Priam . For Delia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wallet , all the color running out of her face . Then the lids had come down as if to shut out a ghost . Shock . But the shock of what ? Fear ? Yes , there was fear , but fear followed the shock ; it did not precede . Suddenly Ellery knew what it was . Recognition . He mulled over this , baffled . It was a new wallet . She could n't possibly have seen it before . Unless . . . For that matter , neither could Priam . Did it mean the same thing to both of them ? Vaguely , he doubted this . Their reactions had thrown off different qualities . Lightning had struck both of them , but it was as if Priam were a meteorologist who understood the nature of the disaster , his wife an ignorant bystander who knew only that she had been stunned . I 'm reading too much into this , Ellery thought . You ca n't judge the truth130 THE ORIGIN OF EVILof anything from a look . . . It 's useless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indefinable way he was glad . It was remarkable how easily passion was killed by a dirty fact . He felt nothing when he looked at her now , not even revulsion . The sickness in the pit of his stomach was for himself and his gullibility . " Delia , where you going ? " She was walking out . " Mother . " So Crowe had seen it , too . He ran after her , caught her at the door . " What 's the matter ? " She made an effort . " It 's all too silly , darling . It 's getting to be too much for me . A wallet ! And such a handsome one , too . Probably a gift from someone who thinks it 's Roger 's birthday . Let me go , Crowe . I 've got to see Mrs. Guittierez about dinner . " " Oh . Sure . " Mac was relieved . And Laurel .. . " The only thing that would throw me , " Keats was drawling , " I mean if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely puzzled by the wallet. "  --  is what the devil I 'd be expected to do with it . Like a battleship getting a lawnmower . " Laurel had been merely puzzled by the wallet , but when she had glimpsed Delia 's face her own had reflected shock . The shock of recognition . Again . But this was not recognition of the object per se . This was recognition of Delia 's recognition . A chain reaction . " When you stop and think of it , everything we know about these presents so far shows one thing in common  --  " " In common ? " said Ellery . " What would that be , Keats ? " " Arsenic , dead frogs , a wallet for a man who never leaves his house . They 've all been so damned useless . " Ellery laughed . " There 's a theory , Mr. Priam , that 's in your power to affirm or deny . Was your first gift useless , too ? The one in the first cardboard box ? " Priam did not lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that box ? " Priam gave no sign that he heard . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 131 " What do these things mean ? " Priam did not reply . " May we have this wallet for examination ? " asked Keats . Priam simply sat there . " Seems to me I caught the flicker of one eyelash , Mr. Queen . " Keats wrapped the wallet carefully in the tissue paper and tucked it back in the box . " I 'll drop you off at your place and then take this down to the Lab . " They left Roger Priam in the same attitude of frozen chaos . KEATS DROVE SLOWLY , handling the wheel with his forearmsand peering ahead as if answers lay there . He was chewing on a cigaret , like a goat . " Now I 'm wrong about Priam , " laughed Ellery . " Perfect score . " Keats ignored the addendum . " Wrong about Priam how ? " " I predicted he 'd blow his top and spill over at warning number four . Instead of which he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary recession . " " You 're sure this thing is a warning . " Ellery nodded absently . " Me , I 'm not , " Keats complained . " I ca n't seem to get the feel of this case . It 's like trying to catch guppies with your bare hands . Now the arsenic , that I could hold on to , even though I could n't go anywhere with it . But all the rest of it . . . " " You ca n't deny the existence of all the rest of it , Keats . The dead dog was real enough . The first box Priam got was real , and whatever was in it . There was nothing vapory about those dead frogs and toads , either . Or about the contents of this box . Or , for that matter , " Ellery shrugged , " about the thing that started all this , the note to Hill . " " Oh , yes , " growled the detective . " Oh yes what ? " " The note . What do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a note , it 's a copy of a note . Or is it even that ? That might be only what it seems . Maybe the whole business was dreamed up by Hill . " " The arsenic , froglets , and wallet were n't dreamed up by Hill , " said Ellery dryly , " not in the light of his current condition and location. 132 THE ORIGIN OF EVILNo , Keats , you 're falling for the temptation to be a reasonable man . You 're not dealing with a reasonable thing . It 's a fantasy , and it calls for faith . " He stared ahead . " There 's something that links these four warnings , ' as the composer of the note calls them , links them in a series . They constitute a group . " " How ? " Bits of tobacco flew . " Poisoned food , dead frogs , a seventyfivedollar wallet ! And God knows what was in that first box to Priam  --  judging by what followed , it might have been a size three Hopalong Cassidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1897 . Mr. Queen , you ca n't connect those things . They 're not connectable . " Keats waved his arms , and the car swerved . " The most I can see in this is that each one stands on its own feet . The arsenic ? That means : Remember how you tried to poison me ?  --  this is a little reminder . The frogs ? That means . . . Well , you get the idea . " But Ellery shook his head . " If there 's one thing in this case I 'm sure of , it 's that the warnings have related meanings . And the over-all meaning ties up with Priam 's past and Hill 's past and their enemy 's past . What 's more , Priam knows its significance , and it 's killing him . " What we 've got to do , Lieutenant , is crack Priam , or the riddle , before it 's too late . " " I 'd like to crack Priam , " remarked Keats . " On the nut . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHONED JUST before midnight . " I thought you 'd like to know what the Lab found out from examination of the wallet and box . " " What ? " " Nothing . The only prints on the box were Mrs. Priam 's . There were no prints on the wallet at all . Now I 'm going home and see if I 'm still married . How do you like California ? " 81ev'e/lOUTSIDE HER GARAGE , Laurel looked around . Her look was furtive . He had n't been in the walnut tree this morning , thank goodness , and there was no sign of him now . Laurel slipped into the garage , blinking as she came out of the sun , and ran to her Austin . " Morning , Little Beaver . " " Mac ! Damn you . " Crowe Macgowan came around the big Packard , grinning . " I had a hunch you had a little something under your armpit last night when you told me how late you were going to sleep this morning . Official business , hm ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed , almost as well as when he was n't . He even wore a hat , a Swiss yodeler sort of thing with a little feather . " Shove over . " " I do n't want you along today . " " Why not ? " " Mac , I just do n't . " " You 'll have to give me a better reason than that . " " You ... do n't take this seriously enough . " " I thought I was plenty serious on the frog safari . " " Well . . . Oh ! all right . Get in . " Laurel drove the Austin down to Franklin and turned west , her chin northerly . Macgowan studied her profile in peace . " La Brea to Third , " he said , " and west on Third to Fairfax . Aye , aye , Skipper ? " " Mac ! You 've looked it up . " " There 's only one Leatherland , Inc. , of Hollywood , California , and it 's in Farmers ' Market . " 134 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop you ! " " Nothing doing . Suppose you found yourself in an opium den ? " " There are no opium dens around Fairfax and Third . " " Then maybe a gangster . All the gangsters are coming west , and you know how tourists flock to Farmers ' Market . " Laurel said no more , but her heart felt soggy . Between her and the traffic hung a green alligator . She parked in the area nearest Gilmore Stadium . Early as they were , the paved acres were jammed with cars . " How are you going to work this ? " asked Crowe , shortening his stride as she hurried along . " There 's nothing much to it . Their designs are exclusive , they make everything on the premises , and they have no other outlets . I 'll simply ask to see some men 's wallets , work my way around to alligator , then to green alligator  --  " " And then what ? " he asked dryly . " Why . . . I 'll find out who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green alligator wallets with gold trimming . Mac , what 's the idea ? Let go ! " They were outside The Button Box . Leatherland , Inc. , was nearby , a double-windowed shop with a ranchhouse and corral fence decor , bannered with multicolored hides and served by a bevy of welldevelopedcowgirls . " And how are you going to get one of those babes to open up ? " asked Crowe , keeping Laurel 's arm twisted behind her back with his forefinger . " In the first place , they do n't carry their customers ' names around in their heads ; they do n't have that kind of head . In the second place , they 're not going to go through their sales slips  --  for you , that is . In the third place , what 's the matter with me ? " " I might have known . " " All I have to do is flash my genuine Red Ryder sheriff 's badge , turn on the charm , and we 're in . Laurel , I 'm type-casting . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and you 'll get more parts than you can handle . " " Watch me  --  fully dressed and lounging - like . " He went into the shop confidently . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 135Laurel pretended to be interested in a handtooled , silver-studded saddle in the window . Although the shop was crowded , one of the cowgirls spotted Crowe immediately and cantered up to him . Everything bouncing , Laurel observed , hoping one of the falsies would slip down . But it was wellanchored , and she could see him admiring it . So could the cowgirl . They engaged in a dimpled conversation for fully two minutes . Then they moved over to the rear of the shop . He pushed his hat back on his head the way they did in the movies and leaned one elbow on the showcase . The rodeo Venus began to show him wallets , bendingand sunfishing like a bronc . This went on for some time , the sheriff 's man leaning farther and farther over the case until he was practically breathing down her sternum . Suddenly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , and withdrew it cupped about something . The range-type siren dilated her eyes .. . When Crowe strolled out of the shop he passed Laurel with a wink . She followed him , furious and relieved . The poor goop still did n't catch on , she thought . But then men never noticed anything but women ; men like Mac , that is . She turned a corner and ran into his arms . " Come to popsy , " he grinned . " I 've got all the dope . " " Are you sure that 's all you 've got ? " Laurel coldly swept past him . " And I thought.you 'd give me a gold star ! " " It 's no make-up off my skin , but as your spiritual adviser  --  if you 're lining up future mothers of the race for the radioactive new world , pick specimens who look as if they can climb a tree . You 'd have to send that one up on a breeches buoy . " " What do you mean , is that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could anything have been more antiseptic ? " " I saw you take down her phone number ! " " Shucks , gal . That was professional data . Here . " He picked Laurel up , dropped her into the Austin , and got in beside her . " They made up a line of men 's wallets in alligator leather last year , dyed three or four different colors . All the other colors sold but the green  --  they only unloaded three of those . Two of the three greens were bought before136 THE ORIGIN OF EVILChristmas , almost seven months ago , as gifts . One by a Broadway actor to be sent to his agent back in New York , the other by a studio executive for some bigshot French producer  --  the shop mailed that one to Paris . The third and only other one they 've sold is unaccounted for . " " It would be , " said Laurel morosely , " seeing that that 's the one we 're interested in . How unaccounted for , Mac ? " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cash-and-carry and did n't have the purchaser 's name on it . " " What was the date ? " " This year . But what month this year , or what day of what month this year , sales slip showeth not . The carbon slipped or something and the date was smudged . " " Well , did n't she remember what the purchaser looked like ? That might tell us something . " " It was n't my babe 's customer , because the initials of the salesgirl on the slip were of someone else . " " Who ? Did n't you find out ? " " Sure I found out . " " Then why did n't you speak to her ? Or were you too wrapped up in Miss Falsies ? " " Miss who ? Say , I thought those were too good to be true . I could n't speak to the other gal . The other gal quit last week . " " Did n't you get her name and address ? " " I got her name , Lavis La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's real name and she does n't know what Lavis 's real name is . Certainly not Lavis or La Grange . Her address is obsolete , because she decided she 'd had enough of the glamorous Hollywood life and went back home . But when I asked my babe where Lavis 's home is , she could n't say . For all she knows it could be Labrador . And anyway , even if we could locate Lavis , my babe says she probably would n't remember . My babe says Lavis has the brain of a barley seed . " " So we ca n't even fix the buyer 's sex , " said Laurel bitterly . " Some manhunters we are . " " What do we do now , report to the Master ? " THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 137 " You report to the Master , Mac . What 's there to report ? He 'll probably know all this before the day 's out , anyway . I 'm going home . You want me to drop you ? " " You 've got more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOUNG MACGOWAN STUCK with Laurel for the remainder of the day ; technically , in fact , until the early hours of the next , for it was five minutes past two when she climbed down the rope ladder from the tree house to the floodlit clearing . He leaped after her and encircled her neck with his arm all the way to her front door . " Sex fiends , " he said cheerfully . " You 're doing all right , " said Laurel , who felt black and blue ; but then she put her mouth up to be kissed , and he kissed it , and that was a mistake because it took her another fifteen minutes to get rid of him . Laurel waited behind the closed door ten minutes longer to be sure the coast was clear . Then she slipped out of her house and down to the road . She had her flashlight and the little automatic was in her coat pocket . Just before she got to the Priam driveway she turned off into the woods . Here she stopped to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directing the feeble beam to the ground , she made her way toward the Priam house . Laurel was not feeling adventurous . She was feeling sick . It was the sickness not of fear but of self-appraisal . How did the heroines of fiction do it ? The answer was , she decided , that they were heroines of fiction . In real life when a girl had to let a man rnake love to her in order to steal a key from him she was nothing but a tramp . Less than a tramp , because a tramp got something out of her trampery  --  money , or an apartment , a few drinks , or even , although less likely , fun . It was a fairly forthright transaction . But she . . . she had had to pretend , all the while searching desperately for the key . The worst part of it was trying to dislike it . That damned Macgowan was so purely without guile and he made love so cheerfully  --  and he was such a138 THE ORIGIN OF EVILdarling  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came off poorly . What a bitchy thing to do , Laurel moaned as her fingers tightened about the key in her pocket . She stopped behind a French lilac bush . The house was dark . No light anywhere . She moved along the strip of lawn below the terrace . Even then it would n't have been so nasty if it had n't concerned his mother . How could Mac have lived with Delia all these years and remained blind to what she was ? Why did Delia have to be his mother ? Laurel tried the front door carefully . It was locked , sure enough . She unlocked it with the key , silently thankful that the Priams kept no dogs . She closed the door just as carefully behind her . Wielding the handkerchief-covered flashlight for a moment , she oriented herself ; then she snapped it off . She crept upstairs close to the banisters . On the landing she used the flash again . It was almost three o'clock . The four bedroom doors were closed . There was no sound either from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Guittierezand Muggs occupied two servants ' rooms off the kitchen downstairs . Laurel tiptoed across the hall and put her ear against a door . Then , quickly and noiselessly , she opened the door and went into Delia Priam 's bedroom . How co-operative of Delia to go up to Santa Barbara , where she was visiting " some old Montecito friends " for the weekend . The cloth-of-gold tree of life spread over the bed immaculately . In whose bed was she sleeping tonight ? LAUREL HOOKED THE FLASH to the belt of her coat and began to open dresser drawers . It was the weirdest thing , rummaging through Delia 's things in the dead of night by the light of a sort of dark lantern . It did n't matter that you were n't there to take anything . What chiefly made a sneak thief was the technique . If Delia 's father , or the unspeakable Alfred , were to surprise her now . . . Laurel held on to the thought of the leaden , blue-lipped face of Leander Hill . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes closet . THE ORIGIN OF EVIL 139The scent Delia used was strong , and it mingled disagreeably with the chemical odor of mothproofing and the cedar lining of the walls . Delia 's perfume had no name . It had been created exclusively for her by a British Colonial manufacturer , a business associate of Roger Priam 's , after a two-week visit to the Priam house years before . Each Christmas thereafter Delia received a quart bottle of it from Bermuda . It was made from the essence of the passionflower . Laurel had once suggested sweetly to Delia that she name it Prophetic , but Delia had seemed not to think that very funny . It was not in the closet . Laurel came out and shut the door , inhaling . Had she been wrong after all ? Maybe it was an illusion , built on the substructure of her loathing for Delia and that single , startling look on Delia 's face as Ellery had held up the green wallet . But suppose it was n't an illusion . Then the fact that it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be significant . BecauseDelia had hurried out of Roger 's den immediately . She might have gone directly upstairs to her bedroom , taken it from among the others , and stowed it away where it was unlikely to be found . By Muggs , for instance . Where might Delia have hidden it ? All Laurel wanted was to see it , to verify its existence .. . It was not in the brassbound teak chest at the foot of the bed . Laurel took everything out and then put everything back . After conquering three temptations to give it up and go home and crawl into bed and pull the bedclothes of oblivion over her head , Laurel found it . It was in the clothes closet after all . But not , Laurel felt , in an honest place . It was wedged in the dolman sleeve of one of Delia 's winter coats , a luxurious white duvetyn , which in turn was encased in a transparent plastic bag . Innocent and clever . Only a detective , Laurel thought , would have found it . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting pain , like the entry of a hypodermic needle ; and then a hardening of everything . She had been right . She had seen Delia carrying one . Weeks before . It was a woman 's envelope bag of forest green alligator leather , with gold initials . The maker 's name was Leatherland , Inc. , of Hollywood , California.
