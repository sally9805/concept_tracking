Ideas for gizmos to put in satellites are as common as scientists ' notebooks , and they range from TV cameras to dogs and chimpanzees . William J. O'Sullivan Jr . of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics favors satellites that can do useful jobs with no instruments at all . <P> One of his satellites , which he prefers to call a sub-satellite , is so light that it can be carried almost as an afterthought by any orbit-bound rocket . It is a balloon of plastic film .00025 in. thick , bonded to aluminum foil .0005 in. thick and packed in a doughnut-shaped container . To inflate the balloon , O'Sullivan provides a capsule of nitrogen gas at 2,000 Ibs. pressure per square inch . The whole apparatus weighs only .69 lb . <P> Sphere of Nothing . When the rocket reaches the orbit , the nitrogen inflates the balloon and pops it out of its container . When all the gas has left the capsule , the balloon is erected into a sphere 30 in. in diameter . The pressure inside it ( .2 lb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum film and make it mirror smooth . After doing this job , the nitrogen escapes into the vacuum outside . O'Sullivan wants to get rid of it because the balloon may be punctured by a meteor , and a jet of gas escaping from it might push it off its regular orbit . <P> O'Sullivan 's modest sphere would not be conspicuous to the naked eye , but it could be picked up easily with low-power moonwatch telescopes . Its great virtue would be its short life . Even on a comparatively high orbit , the tenuous bubble of nothing would be slowed by faint traces of air on the threshold of space . Following a circular course 300 miles above the earth , it would live for only about ten days , and its rapid changes of speed and altitude would measure air density much more accurately than the slow responses of heavier satellites . <P> Corner Satellite . A more ambitious NACA satellite is made of the same aluminized film and weighs only 8.7 lbs . When inflated by a - lb. bottle of gas , it erects into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Corner reflectors are peculiar shapes made of two or three mutually intersecting surfaces of electrically conducting material . They re : ect radio or radar waves with extraordinary efficiency ; small ones stand out on a radarscope as if they were heavy bombers . The NACA plan is to put one of these large but almost immaterial objects on an orbit so high that residual air will not slow it appreciably . At twilight it will look as bright as the North Star , and radars pointed at it will show it plainly . They can follow it on its course and measure its distance and direction continuously . <P> If shot away from the earth at escape velocity ( 25,000 m.p.h. ) , a cheap 8.7-lb. corner reflector can be followed far into space . It can be watched by radar , says the NACA , as it circles the moon and heads back to earth . Its behavior will check the calculations of astronavigators and explore the spaceways for vehicles of the future , carrying instruments or men .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
