txt It is to be hoped that this week 's memorable report of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund  --  which proposed a major Federal tax cut as part of a ? program for reversing the present downward trend of the economy ? will help to get the anti-recession policies of the Administration and Congress off dead center . For that is the one position in which antirecession policies should never be permitted to get . It is really extraordinary that the Administration should have forgotten so soon the experience of 1953-54 when its anti-recession policies brought to a halt within a few months what many feared would be a deep and prolonged recession and set the stage for a recovery that carried economic activity to the highest levels in the nation 's history . Yet this conclusion is inescapable to anyone who compares its reaction to these two challenges , separated by only four years . In 1953 it became evident by mid-year that the economic clouds that had been gathering since spring were not going to blow over  --  that they foreshadowed a general decline in economic activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as early as May to head off the storm and followed this in June and July with even bolder action  --  a reduction in member bank reserve requirements . ? By September , less than three months after the first conclusive evidence that we were in for a general recession , the Secretary of the Treasury declared unequivocally that the excess profits tax and the increase in the personal income tax enacted at the time of the Korean rearmament emergency would be dropped at the end of that year . When this announcement of a very substantial tax cut came , it is worth noting , the reported rate of unemployment was less than 21/2 per cent . Though the recession had been under *way only six months the President 's Council ' of Economic A dvisers told him that " prudence as well as zeal for economic improvement requires that the public policy contribute both to the immediate strength of the economy and to its long-term growth . " Acting on this advice , the President immediately recommended a broad program of legislation , high on the list of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequities , would serve to stimulate business enterprise . Between them , the tax reductions of 1953 and 1954 came to a total of $7.4 billion and to a net figure --  -- after allowing for an increase of $1.3 billion in Social Security contributions ? of $6.1 billion . Dr. Arthur F. Burns , who , as chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers during that period , was perhaps the chief architect of the recovery program , has since set down what he describes as s9me of the " major principles suggested by experience that can usefully guide governmental efforts to check a recession . " It is highly pertinent to note the " principle " that . he has put at the top of his list : " The first principle is that when the economy shows signs of faltering , prompt countermoves are required . Even mild measures on the part of the Government can be effective in the early stage of the economic - decline . On the other hand , if action is withheld until a recession has gathered momentum , even costly measures may prove insufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us compare the Government 's approach to the recession problem of 1957-58 with that of four years earlier . As in 1953 , the point at which the downturn became general has been identified as mid-year . The recession had been under way , therefore , for four and one-half months even before the Federal Reserve acted , on Nov. 15 , to reverse its monetary policy of credit ; estrice Weis . The Administration is still adhering to a " wait and see " attitude on tax reduction , ten months after the nature of the economic decline had become clearly visible . Last week brought the tidings from the Federal Reserve Board that the decline in industrial production had reached 11.7 per cent , the deepest decline of the post-war period . ( The figure did not exceed 10.5 per cent in the recessions of 1949 and 1953 . ) Even more striking are the figures on unemployment . The rate of unemployment , seasonally adjusted , reached its most reH cent low in March , 1957 , at 3.9 per cent . The official figure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost doubled , increasing to 7.0 per cent . That , this ' hoes not represent the full measure of the impact of the recession on the labor force is clear from the ? fact that the average work week in manufacturing has declined from 40.2 hours , in February , 1957 , to 38.5 in Febru-1 ary , 1958.
