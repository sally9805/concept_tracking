In its Manhattan studios , Columbia Records last week showed off a small ( 16 in. by 12 in. by 10 in. ) box which it hopes will revolutionize the phonograph industry just as its long playing records changed the record business . Inside the box was Columbia 's new high fidelity phonograph ( the 360 ) designed by Dr. Peter Goldmark , who developed Columbia 's LPs . Until last week , most " hifi " sets , which reproduce music in the home with the clarity and realism of the concert hall , were custom-made from standard parts by small radio &; phonograph shops at a cost of from $150 to $2,000 . <P> Columbia claims that the tone of its phonograph , which will sell for $139.50 and $144.50 ( depending on the cabinet ) , is a match for all but the most expensive custom-made hi-fi sets . It reproduces tones from a low of 50 cycles per second to a high of 12,000 ( the ordinary hi-fi range ) , compared to a smaller tonal range of 80-6,000 c.p.s. in most phonographs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid wooden cabinet ( which eliminates " tinny " vibration ) and two 6-in. speakers located at each side of the phonograph , instead of one in front . It hopes to sell 25,000 machines in the first year . Columbia is not the only company to decide that the hi-fi cult , started by music lovers who wanted better phonographs than the mass produced models , is now a big enough market for mass production . Stromberg-Carlson brought out a hi-fi set recently , Hallicrafters hopes to bring out a machine early next year , and General Electric is also busy developing one of its own . It looks as if non-hi-fi phonographs may soon be as outmoded as 78 r.p.m. records .
