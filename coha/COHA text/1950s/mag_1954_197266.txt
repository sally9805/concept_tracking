Despite Peking 's attempts to minimize the disaster , China 's worst floods in a century have drowned hundreds , made tens of thousands homeless , and turned an area the size of Missouri , Arkansas , Louisiana and Mississippi into a quagmire of disaster where millions soon might starve ( TIME , Aug. 16 ) . <P> Watching from his island stronghold of Formosa , Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek appealed in the name of humanity to " all Chinese , " whatever their political persuasion , and to all " foreign friends " for flood and famine relief to save the mainland from disaster . He did more : he sent some of his own transport aircraft to drop 60 tons of rice over the worst-hit mainland provinces . The generalissimo did all this despite the cluck-clucking of the U.S. State Department that such assistance ought not to be rendered to enemy regimes . In so doing , Chiang , a practicing Christian , showed more magnanimity , good sense and imagination than the U.S. State Department .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
