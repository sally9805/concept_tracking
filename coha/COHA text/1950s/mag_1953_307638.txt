Bob Taft had been running a slight temperature for a month , and he had severe pain in his right hip . After four days in the Army 's Walter Reed Hospital , he flew home to Cincinnati and checked in at Holmes Hospital . There , one evening last week , he wrapped a blue robe around his bright yellow pajamas and dictated a speech . The next night , in the brilliant Hall of Mirrors of Cincinnati 's Netherland Plaza hotel , Taft 's second son , Lawyer Robert Taft Jr. , stepped before a dinner of the National Conference of Christians &; Jews and read his father 's text . The words were scarcely out of young Bob 's mouth before there was explosive reaction from all around the world . <P> " Abandon Any Idea . " The excitement ( see above ) centered on part of what Senate Majority Leader Taft wrote about the United Nations and its role in Korea . Said he : " I believe we might as well forget the United Nations as far as the Korean war is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate this truce , and if we fail , then let England and our other allies know that we are withdrawing from all further peace negotiations in Korea . . . It seems to me that from the beginning we should have insisted on a general peace negotiation with China , including a unification of Korea under free Koreans , and a pledge against further expansion in Southeast Asia . <P> " If we once make this present truce , no matter what we put in the agreement about further negotiations for a united Korea , it is no more likely to occur than a united Germany . . . I believe we might as well abandon any idea of working with the United Nations in the East and reserve to ourselves a completely free hand . " <P> Events in Korea and elsewhere proved that the U.N . is not an effective force to deal with real aggression . The U.S. and its European allies , he believed , recognized the U.N . ' s weakness when they established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-actually , if not legally-outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was distinctly not recommending that the U.S. completely abandon the United Nations . One section of his speech was a clear , if limited , endorsement of the U.N. : " I believe in the United Nations myself . . . It does have many methods by which , through peaceful persuasion , it can deter and prevent war . It has important agencies which are concerned with the improvement of conditions throughout the world . " <P> Taft repeated his old reservation about basic U.S. policy : " The present Administration has the job of trying to maintain a worldwide alliance against Soviet Russia . I hope that it can be carried through , and only raise here the doubt as to whether it is in fact possible over any long period of years . . . It is pretty hard for the United States to claim the right to cut off trade channels with Communist nations which have existed for centuries . I have no doubt about the desirability of the policy . . . but I do doubt its possibility . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
