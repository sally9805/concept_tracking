By the first of the year , Willys-Overland Motors , Inc. expects to bring out a new line of " Aero " passenger cars that will be " very unlike the jeep " or the jeepster . Willys said last week that its three Aero models will be streamlined , with " long , flowing lines and low silhouettes , " will have small wheel bases ( 108 in. ) and six-cylinder , go-h.p. , high-compression engines which are expected to run up to 35 miles on a gallon of gas . OPS wholesale prices : $1,310 , $1,415 and $1.468 . If Willys tacks on the standard dealers ' markup , Aero retail price will start at about $1,700 . <P> One reason for Willys to put out a car " very unlike the jeep " was provided last week by the Texas supreme court . A man injured in a jeep accident claimed double indemnity ( $200 a month ) , allowed by his insurance policy if the accident involved a " pleasure car . " The court turned him down . Said the majority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rugged , uncouth vehicle without beauty of line or body , with no suggestion of comfort and obviously intended for hard service rather than pleasure .
