Jasper A Story by Emma Smith Drawings by Betty McIntyre 0 N THE day Laura Southey came back from visiting friends at Shillong , her husband shot a tigress in his teagarded . " Oh Roger , " she said , as he drove her back from the station that night , " how dangerous . She might have mauled you . Was she a big one ? " " Big ? " said he . " Biggest I 've ever seen . Whacking great brute . " He took one hand from the wheel and spread the fingers wide open . " Could n't span the pug-mark , " he said , " that 'll show you . . .. " It was no exaggeration , for the tigress had been a fine creature . Laura shuddered when she looked at the close ranks of pampas grass on either side of the car , perfectly still , shining whitely . She urged her husband to drive faster . " What  --  scared , old girl ? " he said , proud of her alarm . Laura and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barely accustomed to the idea of wild animals loitering about her home . It was the first tiger Roger had killed , so he was not ashamed to repeat himself more than once as they bounded along the rocky dust-covered deathly-deserted road under a blazing Assamese moon . " I was just having a quiet lie-back round about two o'clock , " he said , " when that fool Giroo came rushing in all of a sweat , hollering , ' Tiger , tiger . ' So out I went , " said Roger , " and the coolies were all sitting up in trees shaking with terror  --  you know what they 're like  --  and while I was wondering where thehell the thing had got to , there she was . Large as life . Near as you are to me . Looked straight up into my face as cool as you please . " The cold hill air stirred among the flat , fleshy jungle leaves , between the black palms . " Oh Roger , " cried Laura , " were you fright-ened ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger . " Took me by surprise , I suppose . And before I had time to get the wind up , she was dead at my feet . Enormous great beast , Laura , you 've no idea . " He took one hand from the steering wheel and held it out toward her , the fingers stretched wide . " I could n't , " he said , ' ' span her pug-mark , not by more than an inch . " And so , still talking of the incident , they reached home . There was one thing Roger had not told Laura . He wanted to surprise her , and when she went into the living room she was very surprised . In a basket before the fire lay a tiger cub asleep . Laura knelt on the hearth rug to touch the little creature with her fingers . The servants pushed their turbaned heads , gaping with grins , around the doorway . Roger filled his pipe and looked with satisfaction at the result of the day 's shooting . " The mother had it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this Laura was torn with pity and love . " How beautiful he is , " she cried , " just look , how lovely . I should like to call him jasper . " Roger thought this not at all a foolish name for a tiger , and from that moment the animal was known as Jasper . H E SEEMED to grow remarkably quickly . In no time at all he was up to Laura 's knee , and used to follow her round the house , stopping when she stopped and paying attention to whatever it was she did . She thought him wonderful . " He is so intelligent , " she said many times to her husband , and at the end of each day as he leaned back in his sweat-creased shorts , hot and tired , drinking a first whiskey before bathing , she would tell him of Jasper 's behavior since breakfast , his latest habits , the way he winked his eyes , his gentleness , his sense of humor . And after dinner , when Jasper stretched himself between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one another how finely developed , how long and strong were his limbs , how smoothly his skin lay , of what clear gold his eyes were when he opened them to yawn . Indeed , he was very beautiful , very quiet in his behavior , and seemed not to give a second thought to the skin of his mother which decorated one wall in the living room . Fed bountifully on good cooked meat , Jasper grew and grew . In the shortest possible time he was waist-high , and the finest specimen of a tiger it was possible to see . Of Roger and Laura he was the pride and joy . Strangers visiting were so shocked by the sight of Jasper appearing round the side of the house that more than once they turned their car hard round on its tracks and drove , white-faced , away . Roger and Laura laughed very gaily when their servants reported such visits , but even their friends from neighboring teagardens , who knew what to expect , were sometimes alarmed when the great tiger came strolling out onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura , however , laid her small palm confidently on the strong flat head and assured them there was no need to fear . She pulled his ears gently and her eyes shone with love . " He is so beautiful , do n't you think ? " she said . Roger took color photographs of Jasper standing in the middle of the green brilliant lawn , with a fall of scarlet hibiscus flowers behind him , and the warm Indian sun striking twice as richly on his rich red hide . And softly his golden paws crushed the semitropical flowers when he wandered in the garden . Often , spreading wide the fingers of his right hand , Roger would say of him admiringly : " His mother was a huge great creature too . I could n't span her pug-mark with my hand , and I ca n't his . " T HEN Laura and Roger had a baby . During the time of her pregnancy , Laura kept the tiger always by her , and the first words she said to Roger after the child was born were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " that Jasper will like him . " She introduced the two with trepidation . Jasper put his whiskered head , big as a coal scuttle , close up to the child and blew softly . Then he turned his amber eyes mildly toward Laura . Much moved , she burst into tears and threw her arms about his neck . The baby awoke and screwed its wizened face up in screams that drowned the sound of Laura 's sobbing . She wanted to call the child Tiger , but Roger thought this was pushing their devotion too far , and compromised by having his son christened John Jasper Southey . John and Jasper showed every sign of friendliness to each other . In spite of this , one of Laura 's friends said to her , " I wonder how you dare to have that brute around the place with John . " " Oh , good gracious , " answered Laura laughing , " there 's no need to worry about Jasper . He 's as gentle as a kitten . " " He might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never thought of it before , began to watch Jasper for signs of jealousy . She asked her husband what he thought . " Jealous ? " said Roger , " Why should he be ? What , old Jasper ? Of course he is n't . " But all their neighbors seemed to feel the same way about Jasper . What they had previously thought was eccentric and amusing , now appeared to them in a sinister light . " Why , " said one of these , " Jasper could gobble up little John in one mouthful and not even notice it . " Laura felt sick and for a moment her face and fingers went white . " Jasper , " she called , and when he came over to her she looked deeply in his eyes and believed he would not do this . But the talk went on . Roger was teased at the club . Laura reproached at the teatable . They both became irritable , embarrassed with Jasper and sharp with John . " Hungerford says we ought to shoot Jasper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " cried Laura , horrified , " no , no ; I 'd rather shoot John . " She was taken by a fit of violent weeping and Roger left the room gloomily . One day Laura found Jasper standing by John 's pram , his chin resting on the edge , staring in at the sleeping child . She stopped and looked at him , tranced with fear . " You must never do it , Jasper , " she said aloud ; " they would shoot you for that . " The tiger at once looked up at her and seemed , she thought , to grin . Laura went straight to Roger . " Roger , " she said , " people are right . We ought to send Jasper away for a time . Just till John 's older , you know . We could have him back again later , could n't we , in a year or two ? " They talked it over hurriedly and decided to beg a temporary home for him at the nearest zoo , two hundred miles away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lie usually did on waking , to cry . " Oh , " said Laura , putting her hands to her ears , " that noise , that noise . " T HE zoo authorities were delighted to have Jasper . In a year 's time , when John was growing into a pinched little boy with red rims to his pale big eyes , Roger went to visit Jasper in his cage . Laura would have gone too , but John was sick with a cough and so she stayed behind . Roger returned in a few days and looked at Laura sadly . " He did n't know me , " said Roger , " and oh , Laura  --  he 's wild . " " Wild ? " she asked , trembling . " Savage  --  mad as a devil . Laura , I never heard him roar before . " Within twelve months they were told he had died . John , when lie was five years old , took the skin of the tigress from the wall and came crawling on the floor to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " he said , watching her face closely with his ill impish eyes . " You know your name is John , " she replied . " But I 'm called Jasper too . " She leaned forward and struck . his frail face as it peered up at her from under the skin 's dry folds . Never before had she hit him , nor did she ever so again . He backed on his knees away from her and opened his mouth in a tiger 's roar of defiance , but his wretched stomach rose and took him by the throat and held him coughing , coughing , on the floor , with the gaudy skin slipping from his thin shoulders and his eyes fixed on his mother . Thin Partitions JAMES MICHIE W ALKING our cabins criss-cross through the air , Treading the flimsy , delicate decks , we know What winds and spaces hang like sharks below For us to fall , and by The breadth of a hair Still unconcernedly preserve ourselves on air . Talking among our friends we can not tell What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues than the hammers in their ear Thudding , or in their blood The funeral bell Clanging for our decease , although we can not tell . The hand put out to light your cigarette Might strike the face it hates , startle the wise Puckers enveloping its ingrown lies . - That hand would like you dead And buried , yet There it remains , and moves , and lights your cigarette . The man who cracks the joke that makes the tears Crease up the crowsfeet of his happy guest , Ponders the primitive , forbidden jest , Which , like a bomb , his brain Nurses , but fears To stop the crowing laughter of his guest with tears . And you , more near , lying upon my bed , To strangle is as easy as to kiss . This is the gesture of my love , and this My hatred . Should we not Fear , who instead Kissing and trusting , sleep defenselessly in bed .                    @
