Uncle Vanya ( by Anton Chekhov ) is off-Broadway 's latest good deed . This time though the playhouse is a tiny one on the lower East Side , the players include Cinemactor Franchot Tone and other Broadway names . Directing Vanya , as he earlier did The Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard , David Ross has scrupulously put Chekhov 's intentions first : if he sometimes falters with so trickily delicate a play , he oftener succeeds . Chekhov 's provincial tale of pathetically muffed chances and comically muddled lives , of a pompous fool for whom better people have toiled and a shallow woman with whom better men are infatuated , is wonderfully life-sized and life-stained . Compared to The Three Sisters or The Cherry Orchard , Vanya has little resonance or fragrance : it offers fly-specks rather than patina , flatted notes oftener than chords . Chekhov boils down his characters ' moral attitudes to reveal personal resentments , and shows the flabbiness of it-might-have-been no less than the pathos . But just because his people exhibit as much needless waste as honest wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And because Chekhov was compassionate as well as lynx-eyed , Vanya shows how real the hurts can be , however comic the poses and self-pities . <P> In avoiding the sentimentalized Chekhov of sighs and samovars , this Vanya now and then overplays the comic side . But thanks to some good performances , including Actor Tone 's , and to Stark Young 's sensitive translation , it reveals why Chekhov-type playwrights are still panting to catch up with the master .
