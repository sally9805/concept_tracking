txt Railroad commuter service to the South Shore of Boston appears to have less than a three weeks ' period to run . Flashing the red light is George Alpert , president , of the New York , New . Haven &; Hartford Railroad . He told the Old Colony Advisory Council yesterday that the line would need a $1,190,000 annual subsidy in order to continue service . Last year Boston and 38 South Shore communities paid a $900,000 subsidy to the railroad in order to keep service running until June 30 of this year . Not only does Mr. Alpert want more than $1,000,000 as a subsidy , he said the line would have to reduce service by close to 50 per cent . In the opinion of key legislators , the subsidy bill stands a very slim chance - of passage , even if it should receive the approval of the Old Colony Advisory Council . This also is unlikely . Senator John E. Powers ( D ) , of Boston , president of the Senate , who influenced the passage of the original subsidy bill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " There wo n't be another subsidy , " he added emphatically . State Holds Option Meanwhile , Edward J. McCormack , Jr. , Massachusetts Attorney General , said that he would appear in United States District Court , New Haven , Conn. , on Monday , seeking a clarification of the state 's option to purchase the Old Colony lines . Under the New Haven 's reorganization plan , the state obtained the privilege of acquiring the trackage ' of the Old Colony line from Fort Point Channel to the Braintree station for $1,200,000 salvage value . The state has until Aug. 15 to exercise its option to purchase the Old Colony rails . After that date , the New Haven can sell the trackage for its market value . Metropolitan planners in Greater Boston repeatedly have urged , however , that the state acquire this , as well as other rights of way . These rights of way , if carelessly abandoned would cost millions of dollars to recover , or rebuild under present market values , it is pointed out . Bus Runs Charted Senator Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the legislative committee on transportation which will hold an executive session today on the Old Colony situation . said : " That would seem to be the end of the Old Colony . I do n't think the people or the Legislature will go for that kind of subsidy , but I can speak only for myself . " George A. Yarrington , chairman of the Old Colony Area Transportation Commission , whose bill for an independent rapid transit system linked to Boston 's Metropolitan Transit Authority is now before the legislature , also forecast the end of New Haven operation on June 30 . Arrangements will be made , he said , with the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway to add buses to their regular runs from Ashmont and Fields Corner for the handling of passengers from Quincy , Braintree , Weymouth , and Hingham . Subsidy Debated ? " Under no circumstances , " Mr. Yarrington said , " would buses handling passengers from Quincy , Braintree , Weymouth , and Hingham be run directly into downtown Boston .

One of the leading proponents of rail as compared with bus service is Senator Charles W. Hedges ( R ) of Quincy . A vocal champion of continued Old Colony service , Senator Hedges said recently that if this line ceases operations he " may reluctantly have to vote for rapid transit service " for the area . In the opinion of many transportation and metropolitan planners elimination of the railroad operation , would sweep away some confused thinking and start some realistic planning for rapid transit . Survey Data Cited Fast rapid transit service , metropolitan planners have argued since the Coolidge report of 1947 , connecting up all of the suburban commuter routes with Boston 's Metropolitan Transit Authority , appears to be the ultimate answer to the travel-to-work problem . This service , tying up the suburban commuter network with the city 's MTA , would add to the mobility of the suburban commuter .
