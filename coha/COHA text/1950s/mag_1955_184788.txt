Ulysses ( Lux ; Paramount ) brings to the screen the greatest adventure story of the Western world . Visually , the picture could scarcely be better . The camera 's Cyclopean eye stares deep into the Minoan age that has come down only in legend and a few tantalizing shards from Peloponnesus and Crete . Misty islands float in a magic wide-screen sea , naiads romp along the water 's edge , enchantresses lurk in sacred groves , galleys roll and toss on angry waves conjured up by Poseidon . <P> Even Kirk Douglas , tanned and bearded , looks the part of Ulysses , though when he speaks , it is clear that he is more at home in Ithaca , N.Y . than the Ithaca of Homer . In fact , talk is one of the picture 's major flaws . It was filmed in the Mediterranean with a French , Italian and American cast , and most of the parts have had to be dubbed in English . The dubbers dubbed the job . In the opening sequence , where Penelope ( Silvana Mangano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and lip movements is particularly awry , but this should bother only the churlish few who concentrate on Silvana 's lips instead of Silvana entire . <P> Homer 's epic story has been greatly shortened and considerably amended by a battery of writers ( Ben Hecht and Irwin Shaw plus three Italians and a Briton ) . But the Odyssey has been tampered with before and suffered no appreciable damage . Purists will find cause to complain in the sprucing up of Ulysses ' character ; he emerges less a calculating Greek warrior than an upstanding cowboy hero outfitted with chiton instead of chaps , sandals instead of saddlebags . <P> The adventures themselves retain the timeless quality of myth : the gigantic Cyclops is chillingly acted by Umberto Silvestri , and his howls of frenzy at the loss of his eye are enough to shatter cliffs ; the immortal and immoral Circe ( also played by Silvana Mangano ) can call up tempests or turn men into porkers with equal ease . The screen writers have added one imaginative touch to the incident of the Sirens ' rock : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulysses , bound to the mainmast , is driven to frantic despair by the pleading voices of his wife and son , crying to him that he must not desert them any longer . <P> Hollywood , despite its penchant for violence , could not face up completely to the slaughter of Penelope 's suitors when Ulysses finally returns to claim his rightful place as king and husband ; even so , it takes quite a scene of carnage to get the bloody business done with . <P> Mostly , the cast is one that Homer might have approved . In her revealing classical finery , Silvana Mangano is as provocative and enticing as a Tanagra figurine . Rossana Podesta plays the abandoned Nausica with all the sad airs and graces of a bereft princess . In the role of Penelope 's leading suitor , Anthony Quinn shows a wily nobility , and young Franco Interlenghi as Ulysses ' son gives real substance to his role of a stubborn adolescent . Kirk Douglas is more at home in the acrobatics of his part than in its subtleties , and occasionally seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword . Yet , like the others , he often responds to Director Mario Camerini 's neat combination of archaic flavor and modern pace . Technicolor , deft costuming and set decoration help immeasurably in creating the dreamlike quality of mankind 's heroic age .
