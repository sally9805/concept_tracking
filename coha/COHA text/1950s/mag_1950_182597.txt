Director Walter Heil , 59 , of San Francisco 's M. H. De Young Memorial Museum , got his reputation for sharp eyes and cagey bargaining in 1948 when he spotted a marble boy on a Manhattan art dealer 's window sill , bought it for $1,800 . Experts agreed that it was one of the few existing works of the 18th Century Italian master , Andrea del Verrocchio ( TIME , March 14 , 1949 ) , and worth many times its purchase price . <P> While traveling in Europe last July , Bargain Hunter Heil dropped in at a tourist art shop in Florence , asked the proprietress if she had " anything old " on hand . She opened a drawer , pulled out a wooden panel containing a portrait of 16th Century Venetian Doge Leonardo Lore-dano , observed that she had long thought it might be the work of the great Venetian painter , Gentile Bellini . Heil took a sharp look , decided she was probably right and closed the sale on the spot . Later , Italian experts confirmed his verdict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the De Young Museum put the Bellini Doge on display along with the Verrocchio boy and a picture of Christ and the Magdalen , painted in collaboration by Flemish Masters Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Bruegel the Elder , which Heil also bought cheap from a Canadian dealer last spring . The three works of art had cost the museum less than $10,000 ; the museum put their combined value at $100,000 . <P> Director Heil smilingly warned San Franciscans not to expect such luck indefinitely : " We ca n't always keep buying things at bargain prices . " He hoped his bargain display might encourage San Franciscans to chip in and help the museum buy on the open market .
