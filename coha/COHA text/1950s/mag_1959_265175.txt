Harmony was in the air as the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy met last week to hear AEC 's new program to develop U.S. atomic power . After the long battles between Lewis <P> Strauss and Congress , there was hope for an era of good feeling under new AEC Chairman John A. McCone , who talked of a more vigorous program-just what the committee wanted . <P> But McCone touched a sensitive committee nerve almost at once by saying that " efforts during the past five years have paid off in remarkable progress . I believe we have had a good program . " Snapped Tennessee 's Democratic Senator Albert Gore , author of a bill to spend $1 billion on advanced nuclear development by 1965 : " It has failed miserably , else you might not be chairman of the commission . " <P> Shortly after , California 's Democratic Representative Chet Holifield tangled with McCone . Holifield had read a draft of AEC 's plan two days earlier , and while McCone was testifying , he issued a press release criticizing the AEC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When a copy of the release was handed to McCone while he was still on the stand , he grew red with anger , waved it in the air , cried : " I just do n't know why I am here , Mr. Chairman . I find that Mr. Holifield had a press release all printed and written up before he even heard what I had to say . If you want me to come up and testify , listen to me , and then make up your minds . " Holifield replied with a maxim oft quoted by Harry Truman : " If you ca n't stand the heat , do n't go into the kitchen . " <P> Six for Nine . The fact was that Chairman McCone , his funds cut back by the Bureau of the Budget , had presented a program that went little farther than last year 's ( TIME , Jan. 26 ) . The Democrats charged that the AEC 's plan , which calls for $249 million for atomic power projects in fiscal 1960-more than half of it for the military-actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new money for civilian power reactors , v. $74 million authorized last year . AEC would drop six projects intended for 1959 , including a 100,000-kw. heavy-water reactor , an experimental reactor fueled by molten salt , a small-scale pressurized water reactor , and three small experimental reactors . In their place , it would add six entirely new projects at about the same cost . <P> What particularly irked some of the public-power-minded members of the committee was the postponement of atomic power projects approved last year with two public power groups in Nebraska and Alaska . <P> Major Change . The committee had pressed AEC to take a bigger part in developing second-generation prototype plants for atomic power , on the theory that private firms have neither the money nor the know-how to go ahead fast enough . AEC 's new plan still leaves the job largely to private industry , but there is one major concession . AEC , which now contributes only toward research and fuel costs of privately built plants , would offer private industry up to 50% of the cost of building prototype reactors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
