txt Several enterprising Italian agents for American automobile manufacturers have built up a thriving business with South America . Every month , they arrange delivery of hundreds of high-priced cars delivered to customers in Rio de Janeiro , Sao Paolo , and Buenos Aires . It matters little that dealers never see either the buyers or the cars , which are shipped directly to South America from ports of embarkation in the United States , but they reap huge profits just the same . Luxury models , which sell for around ** in America , command four or five times that amount in South-American countries . where , because of customs restrictions , few American cars are to be had at any price . But an immigrant has the right to bring in a car duty-free , not that many would normally avail themselves of this opportunity . After paying for their passage , most Italian immigrants have hardly enough money left for a pair of shoes , let alone an expensive car , And this is where the car dealer comes in . From the steamship lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he contacts personally , offering them a lump sum  --  the usual rate is around S300 ? for the use of their names . The cars are then shipped , nominally consigned to Italian emigrants , and , on the strength of this , passed by customs . The emigrant , whose name is entered on the invoice , never sees the car , which is promptly picked up by the Italian dealer 's South American correspondent . But customs regulations have been complied with , the whole transaction is perfectly legal , and the South American authorities do not object . This original form of commerce now is so highly organized that any Italian wishing to emigrate to South America can finance his trip by signing on the dotted line . Were it not for South America , there would be little money in representing American automobile makers in Italy . Currency difficulties , tariff walls , and the high price of gasoline together have about ruined the internal market in American cars .                @ @ @ @ @
