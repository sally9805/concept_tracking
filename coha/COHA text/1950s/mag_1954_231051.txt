The koshava , a snow-bearing wind reported to be from Russia , had blocked the road , but the army broke out an infantry company to shovel it clear so that Tito could attend the annual dinner of the foreign correspondents who work in Belgrade . There , the 62-year-old dictator , rejecting native rakija in favor of three Martinis , swapped opinions convivially until an unprecedented 1:15 a.m . He talked of Milovan Djilas , the vice president he had stripped of all offices for being soft on democracy . He loved the man , said Tito , but politically Djilas is through for good . Mr. Djilas is a talented writer , the dictator added thoughtfully - perhaps he can find work in the literary field . <P> Tito thought that relations with Russia since Stalin 's death were very little better than before ( " We want normal relations , " he later explained , " but , naturally , there need not be friendly relations " ) .

Oh , said Tito , in that case-Gina Lollobrigida , ( Four years ago , before his marriage to a 28-year-old ex-partisan , Tito admitted to somewhat different cinema favorites : cowboys and Laurel &; Hardy . ) <P> Later , to a group of touring U.S. editors , Tito unburdened himself on one other matter . He was very much concerned , said Communist Tito , that the actions of Wisconsin 's Senator Joseph McCarthy were undermining the U.S. Government 's prestige abroad , and might spoil Europe 's good opinion of the U.S. way of life .
