The bright future of three-dimensional films ( TIME , Feb. 9 ) was Hollywood 's No. 1 topic of talk . Said Movie Spokesman Eric Johnston last week : " This may well go down in history as the year 1953-D . " Wrote Gossipist Louella Parsons : " Nothing since the atomic bomb has struck the motion-picture industry with such force . . . " <P> The fuse of the bomb was the unexpected public interest in depth pictures . When the recent big box-office returns started coming in from 3-D movies , the rush began for the vaults and the warehouses to dust off and improve 3-D equipment . The basic principles of three-dimensional films have been kicking around for more than 25 years-e.g. , audiences back in 1937 put on red &; green glasses to watch Pete Smith 's " audioscopiks . " <P> The producers , their sensitive nerves tuned to public reaction , have made a calculated gamble that the interest is permanent rather than just a passing fad . <P> The problem is how to serve up the new product . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy tickets to see a 3-D film with Polaroid glasses , or to see , without glasses , a three-dimension " illusion . " The ideal solution may come from some hard-working engineer who figures out a true stereoscopic system which requires no glasses . This would be Hollywood 's best answer to television , just as sound pictures answered the vaudeville stage in the early ' 30s . <P> Meanwhile , some sort of standardization for exhibitors is a problem . Exhibitors were invited to Manhattan last week to meet the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers to hash the matter over . At the moment , each system has its enthusiastic rooter . Fox 's Spyros P. Kouras , flying off to scout the 3-D foreign field , predicted that by next October some 2,500 theaters across the country will be equipped for Cinemascope . <P> Catching some of Hollywood 's excitement , the New York Herald Tribune editorialized on the 3-D age : " The flat screen , the silent screen , the uncluttered stage of Shakespeare and Marlowe , even the book in an armchair before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders may now be expected of a medium which out-engulfs all these predecessors and makes every man a voyager to a brave new world !
