He was born Meer Genokh Moiseevich Vallakh , the son of a Jewish bank clerk in Polish Russia . On police dockets of Czarist Russia and most of the countries of Europe , he was many aliases-Ludwig Nietz , Maxim Harrison , David Mordecai , Felix . To Lenin , Stalin and the other Old Bolsheviks , he was Papasha ( papa dear ) , one of the trusted inner circle . The rest of the world got to know him as Maxim Maximovich Litvinoff . For two confusing decades , he was one of Russia 's two faces - the false one . <P> His early years fitted him for the Communist aristocracy-a poor childhood , the Czar 's army at 18 , underground intrigue with secret printing presses , a term in prison , escape . In exile , he became boss of the party 's international " transport , " which is Communist doubletalk for the smuggling of arms , money and secret communications . " As long as Papasha is there , " Lenin remarked admiringly one day in 1904 , " we shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they caught him passing 500-ruble notes stolen in the bloody Tiflis bank robbery engineered by Joseph Stalin . In England , as gentle , homy Mr. Harrison of Harrington Square , he erected a faade of innocuous jobs ( publisher 's assistant , bookkeeper , language teacher , corset salesman ) , took on Western airs and a Western wife . She was Ivy Low , radical daughter of an English writer . He came to admire the works of Henry James , Jane Austen , Beethoven and Bach ; he took up contract bridge . But Litvinoff remained Bolshevik to the core-a blunt , opportunistic , skeptical revolutionary , with a keen , mousetrap kind of mind that was wired always to orders from home . <P> The Waiting Room . After the Revolution , Trotsky made Litvinoff Ambassador to Britain . The British refused to accept him , agreed only grudgingly to deal with him through a Foreign Office clerk . For a while , the two met by a kiosk behind the Foreign Office . But after a few pathetic meetings in the rain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the waiting room . <P> When he came to England again , in 1936 , Maxim Litvinoff got an audience with the King and all the amenities . Papasha-and the Soviet Union-had climbed to respectability . As Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs ( 1920-30 ) and then as Commissar , Litvinoff had cut through the " barbed-wire fence " which France 's Clemenceau had persuaded the West to raise around Russia . He sold most of the Western world on the proposition that Communism was able &; willing to cooperate with the West . <P> He constructed a network of treaties between Russia and 14 countries . He negotiated with Roosevelt for U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union in 1933 . He got Russia a seat in the League of Nations . There , in passionate , blunt speeches , delivered in an English that was both Cockney and Slavic in accent , he became the apostle of disarmament , of collective security , and of opposition to the Nazis . " Peace is indivisible " was his famous phrase . He was personally liked and respected-a far warmer person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gullible believed that there was a Litvinoff policy that differed from a Stalin policy .
