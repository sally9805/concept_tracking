txt What does a nation properly owe its veterans ? The report of the President 's Commission on Veterans ' Pensions makes a stab at answering this intricate question . And as far as its answers go , they make sense . Congressional and other inquiries have recently turned up some abuse in the handling of veterans ' affairs ? notably instances of well-heeled individuals getting free hospitalization for injuries or ailments not incurred in service . But there is bound to be abuse in a conglomeration of programs which will soon be costing some $7 billion a year . There are more basic moral questions than that of abuse . Nearly half the American population consists of veterans or veterans ' dependents . Benefits to'which they are potentially entitled include free hospitalization , free education , home-financing help , low-cost insurance and pensions . Obviously a nation owes something to its veterans , but do all the people owe subsidies to half the people ? One reason for this highly-varied generosity was a desire to make the readjustment to civilian life relatively painless . Yet the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is now nearly eleven years since World War H ended . For most the readjustment is long past . Many are prosperous , many more can get along without preferential treatment . The Commission would curtail or gradually end a number of the programs . It would revamp the pension system to take account of the facts that most people are already covered by Social Security and that there has been a tremendous growth of private pension plans . It would deny to peacetime veterans the education , business , home and pension benefits . Such recommendations are sensible , if overdue . And implicit in the tone of the report is the fundamental distinction which should never have been allowed to get obscured . That is the distinction between those who die or are disabled in their country 's service and those who emerge unscathed . To the survivors of the dead the nation does indeed owe generosity ; perhaps it owes more than it is now providing . To the totally disabled it owes as rewarding a life as the circumstances permit . To the partially disabled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ability to earn . The Commission would make adjustments along these lines ; it would , for example , provide more for total disability . For the rest , we think most would agree in their hearts that there is a limit  --  certainly a time limit  --  to what they are entitled to receive from the nation . If a man served in World " War II or Korea without injury , he gave up two or three years for his country , it 's true . But did he owe his country any less ? And we think a great many veterans in this category would gladly enough give up preferential treatment if it would mean both improvements for the survivors and the disabled and a reduction in the total veterans ' bill ? not only for ourselves but for our children . It is , at any rate , along these lines that Congress should consider overhauling veterans ' programs . Veterans are supposed to be a particularly powerful pressure group . But Congress might be surprised how many of the hale and hearty ones would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
