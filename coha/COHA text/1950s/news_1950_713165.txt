txt The information activities of the State Department are operating on a $35,000,000 budget . Congress has been asked to add another $89,000,000 in order that " The Voice of America " may be heard more effectively the world around ; in order that it may compete more vigorously with the voices from Moscow . You can buy a lot of publicity for the ? United States with the dollars being spent now and with the larger number of dollars which Congress presumably will vote for these activities . But we would get more good publicity for the United ' States out of those dollars if " The Voice " and the other activities of the information division of the State Department could spend all their time " selling " salable commodities rather than having to spend a large part of their time and effort trying to explain away and apologize for unsalable commodities . A A A Right now " The Voice " is having to spend almost its entire time and effort trying to undo two actions fabulously damaging to the prestige ? and position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies . The Senate vote allocating $100,000,000 to Generalissimo Franco 's Spain seems like a good thing at Democratic national headquarters . It may buy some votes for the Democratic ' , Party or at least prevent ? some from being lost which might otherwise be lost . But it would be difficult to think of a more " unsalable " commodity for overseas consumption . The same goes for General 's visit to Generalissimo and Mme Chiang Kai-shek on the island of Formosa . A A A It is not overstating the case to say that not since President Truman claimed a nonexistent American monopoly of atomic bomb secrets has so much damage been done to American prestige around the world . Our friends and allies have been shocked and shaken . It 's no use arguing that the United States may be right in wishing to see General Franco subsidized and Generalissimo Chiang sustained . The fact is that western Europe wants none of General Franco and our Asiatic allies disagree Justus . Minneapolis Star Tell the World We 're Not Fascists , Uncle ! Christian Science Monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to . No one could , possibly calculate the cost of a publicity operation sufficient to overcome the bad effect of these two actions . As a matter of fact , it is probable that no amount of money spent on publicity ever could wipe out entirely the damaging effect of these episodes on our stock of good will in the world . " The Voice " does n't even try . It reported these events as quietly and inconspicuously as it dared , and let it go at that , just hoping that our frierids in Europe and Asia would give us credit at least for being honest . A A A The upshot of it all is that we should recognize that we do n't necessarily get a hundred millions in good publicity from a hundred millions appropriated to " The Voice " and other related publicity operations . The slickest advertising agency in America could n't make western Europe like Franco or Asia like Chiang . Good public relations begin with having salable commodities to market . The less salable the commodity , the more money needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for domestic political reasons , to vote money for a cause as unpopular abroad as Franco 's , Congress automatically should put another 10 millions in the kitty for " The Voice .
