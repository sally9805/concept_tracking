 | " Just Call Me'Gorgeous ! " Ted Shane Condensed from The American Mercury P E WORE a purple lounging suit with ponyskin loafers when we met in a New York beauty parlor for our first interview . " I must inform you , Mr. Shane , " said Gorgeous George stiffly , as the hairdresser doused his dome with touch-up juice for his 1950 New York wrestling bout , " that what I do is not an act . I do it because I love colors and cleanliness . And , " he added thoughtfully , " attracting attention . " I had caught my first glimpse of Gorgeous George on television . Ile not only kept the fans at the arena waiting but he got us TV-ites restless for his entrance . Suddenly the camera turned to the door of the Great Man 's dressing @# room . It opened but Gorgeous George did not emerge . Instead a gentleman 's gentleman , faultlessly attired in cutaway , striped pants and derby , came out carrying a silver tray on which rested a huge spray gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small prayer rug . The gentleman 's gentleman climbed into the ring , set down the tray , carefully placed the rug where his master would ' ? s enter , and the bath mat where he would stand , then like a bored hospital attendant he thoroughly drenched the scene with the spray gun , ropes and all all , that is , except George 's opponent , who stood snarling in his corner . Then to the distant strains of  | Pomp and Circumstance entered Gorgeous George . His cardinal 's robe reached from his neck to the floor . His golden hair was in ringlets . A dainty mastodon , he climbed to his corner , and inspected his manicure while the crowd booed and cheered . From time to time Gorgeous removed a gold bobby pin from his hair and tossed it disdainfully to the crowd . The valet then carefully removed the robe , gave the marcelled mop a flick of the comb and retired as George , 208 pounds of solid b ag nificence , stood revealed in what were described as shocking-pink wrestling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George shrugged from contact with his germ-laden opponent until the rival hone cruncher grabbed two generous handfuls of George 's crowning glory and slammed him across the ring . Tampering with the hairdo seemed to irritate George and he began to fling his tormentor around like a pellet in a pinball machine ? winning ultimately with some expert wrestling . Donning his robe , and ignoring the needling crowd , he exited majestically , an irritated god with a mussed-up hairdo . I told him of my experience watching him . " Yes , " he agreed matter-of-factly , " I do n't know if I was made for television or if television was made for me . " Ten years ago wrestling was flat on its financial back . Today , changed to a strange mixture of buffoonery and extravaganza , it provides a good living for some 3000 glorified pretzel benders ; and 24 million cash customers pay 36 million dollars a year to see them perform . Gorgeous George is probably the No. i draw . Only three of his rivals the reconstituted Primo Camera , Mr. America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $noo , non-a-year mark , which lie easily overshoots . " I do n't want to be a millionaire , " he says . " I just want to live like one . " ; orgeou.s George has set a vogue . Most headliners cast themselves in de f i n i t e roles . There 's The Gorilla , who is wheeled to the ring in a cage , snarling and rattling at the bars ; and The fiat , who removes a long black robe , then flails his arms in batlike style and gives the impression that he is about to quaff his opponent 's blood . Mr. America is resplendent in a patriotic cape , while the Golden Superman gleams with gilt shorts , gilt cloak , gladiator boots and gilded tresses . Gorgeous George was born George Wagner in Seward , Neb . IIc says he 's 34 ( all wrestlers , I find , are 34 ) . He grew up in Houston , Texas , where his strength was a neighborhood fable . One day he took on 14 of his schoolmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George quit school early and went to work . He packed strawberries , ground oil-well drill bits , chopped cotton , wrecked autos ; he finally found typewriter repairing to his liking and for a time settled at that . He left home at 19 , wrestled for small sums wherever he could .  | " I got a little work , mostly out of my class , " George reveals . " They do little unkind things like trying to break your toes and fingers . Your hands are your breadwinners . Many a time I lay on my bed in my cheap hotel , hungry and broke , and wished I was home . " George floated around , gaining weight , experience and sporadic bouts before coming to a temporary halt in Portland , Ore . Winning the state light-heavy crown at 175 pounds , he began getting into semifinals at a standard $75 and Sloth Ambition soared . " I asked myself , ' Why is n't a good wrestler like yourself in the finals ? ' " He reasoned that he was n't attracting enough attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for the louder crashes in clothes . Most wrestlers favored wrinkled bargain-basement bathrobes , which when removed revealed discolored trunks and black shoes . At the Labor Temple in Eugene , Ore. , in 1941 , George wore a dream creation of royal blue swarming with sequins . " It was sensational , " George modestly admits . " I took off the robe , folded it carefully , and placed it in my corner . Someone snatched it up and tossed it to somebody else . By the time the police got it back for me it was n't fit for a mop . It cost $250 and I was so mad I offered to wrestle the whole place . " George designed another robe of equal gorgeousness . This time he banded it to the policeman who had escorted him into the ring . As he bowed ironically to the heckling crowd , it set up a crescendo chorus of catcalls and boos . Wagner was so impressed by his reception that he dreamed up five more robes ? to keep his wardrobe from becoming monotonous . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $1200 . " Artificial ? " He looked at me as if I 'd stabbed him . " Please , Mr. Shane , I am not a charlatan ! " Customers many of them women ? flocked to see the Daring Innovator . One evening at Eugene a young lady breathed audibly : " My ! Is n't he gorgeous ! " A bell rang in Wagner 's mind . " That 's it ? I 'm Gorgeous George ! " The announcer , too , had overheard the young lady and introduced him as Gorgeous George Wagner . Reactions of the press at first made George a trifle unhappy , but he soon forgot his wounded feelings in the din made by the cash registers . In Tulsa in 1943 he had another inspiration . Bothered by the problem of the constabulary having to care for his robe , George hired an ex-bus boy to attend to this and other needs of a rising celebrity . Having contracted a severe infection from a mat burn , George had made it a practice to inspect the ring carefully before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spray gun . Now his man Friday was brought into the act . Correctly attired in a valet 's outfit , he solemnly appeared in the ring at Columbus , Ohio , with tray , spray gun , smelling  | salts , unguents , comb and bath mat . What happened was indescribable mounting hysteria . " I kept thinking , " he says , " Gorgeous , you 've added something to your profession . ' " Incidentally , George wants it clearly understood he does not perfume the ring . " What I use , " he explains scientifically , " is a strong phenol base ? with an odorant to make it bearable . " George was in Honolulu when the Muse struck again . His - hair , nut brown and long , had been getting into his eyes during bouts . Walking into a beauty salon bravely , he sat down and said : " I want a perma-nent ! " Goggle-eyed , the salonists went to work . Before they had finished , a crowd of 300 had collected outside to watch . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was creating attention and helping wrest ling . " But once you begin fooling with your hair you never do seem to get it right . For a time the curls remained native nut-brown , then red , and now they arc buttercup-yellow . He says he has worn his hair long ever since , as a boy , he learned from the picture on a dollar bill that George Washington wore his that way . Television was just getting started on the Pacific Coast . After his four consecutive appearances at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles a few years ago , George assures you , the sale of sets jumped by thousands . Promoters clamored for his services and George upped his take until he now gets 27 percent of the gate . About 40 percent of his audiences are women . In 1947 George had his name legally altered to Gorgeous George . When I was uncertain how to address him , he answered quite unaffectedly , " Just call me Gorgeous . " Major investment against the day someone wrenches out his hair or spine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calif . Thus far , $ ; oo , 000 has gone into producing the World 's Most Gorgeous Broad-Breasted Turkeys . Should the Gorgeous Turkeys fail , there are the Gorgeous George Dolls , Strength Belts , Bathrobes , and a hook demonSt rating judo defense for women . It is said that all wrestling bouts are fixed . This is partially true . Only two types of bouts today can be declared lily-white contests of skill : those between " clean " wrestlers and those which occur when two headliners clash . When I asked George about it , however , he replied haughtily : " You might also ask me if I enter false income-tax returns or beat my wife . To the best of my knowledge I have never engaged in any fraudulent bout in my entire 19 years of wrestling . I ca n't afford to be dishonest ; besides , everybody is in there trying to kill me . " He was suspended in New York recently for disputing a decision with a referee and a week later in Chicago , too . There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The referee 's name ? Jack Dempsey . Suspensions bother Gorgeous little ; 46  | other states clamor for him and he is the darling of the West Coast . The wrestling business ranks George among the top dozen . Of 207 bouts last year , he lost only three . Although wrestlers do precious little wrestling these days , preferring more spectacular forms of mayhem , George is a master grappler who knows all the holds , about 90 in number . Equally important , he also knows how to break them . George 's own specialty is the Flying Mare , an adaptation of Strangler Lewis 's famed headlock . Getting a headlock on his opponent , George twists his own legs and jumps unexpectedly in the air while spinning around . This jerks the fellow off his feet , and George slaps him down and falls on him . " Should he fail to leave the mat , his head may come loose in my hands , " George explains . " It 's all balance and leverage ? and after 19 years I 'm still learning about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his argument that wrestling is hardly a bed of roses . He 's a mass of knots from head to toe , results of sledge-hammer blows delivered by the forbidden closed fist when the referee 's attention was elsewhere . Every ligament and socket has been severely wrenched and a cauliflower ear impairs his appreciation of fine music . He 's had his eyes sawed back and forth along the ropes . He 's broken his shoulder blade and his collarbone ; a friendly colleague once snapped his wrist after he had given up ; and his ribs have been cracked several times . Not all danger lurks in the ring itself . Women like Hatpin Mary ( recently enjoined ) will sit at the ringside and prod any portion of a protruding anatomy . When George has landed in the seats , women have pulled his curls and clubbed him on the head with their spiked heels . Others have showered him with bottles . Men seem to bear special resentment toward him . When he flung the Black Panther into the seats not long ago in Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring to attack him . Despite everything , Gorgeous George is a happy man . He has an adoring family , a personal Fort Knox , and a secure future . Only one thing bothers him . Each afternoon of a bout he must submit to the tortures of the hair parlor . Every ten days there must be a touch-up session for the growing roots . I sat with him in a New York cubicle while cloths were adjusted under the generous jowls and a halo of aluminum was placed over his curls . " I 've been in tougher spots than this , " he muttered , " but I ca n't remember when . "
