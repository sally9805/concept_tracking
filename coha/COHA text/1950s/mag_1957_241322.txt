THE MERCHANT or PRATO ( 422 pp. ) - Iris Origo-Knopf ( $7.50 ) . <P> In the square of the city of Prato ( pop . 30,586 ) , a few miles outside Florence , stands the statue of a 14th century merchant dressed in flowing robes and holding a sheaf of bills of exchange . The merchant 's name is Francesco di Marco Datini , and he is still Prato 's favorite son . When he died , Datini left his whole fortune of 70,000 gold florins to the town 's poor , along with his spacious house and all his papers . The interest on his capital is still shared out annually ( about $1,100 ) among poor Pratese , but to those who write and love social history it is Datini 's papers that constitute the real treasure-trove . <P> Heaped into sacks and bundled under the stairs of his house , the Datini papers came to light again in 1870 , little the worse for damp and mice . They included no fewer than 150,000 letters , more than 500 account books , 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unique record of early Renaissance trade and a remarkable story of an early capitalist . British-born Marchesa Iris Origo ( Leopardi : A Study in Solitude-TIME , Aug. 2 , 1954 ) has done a brilliant job of sifting the Datini papers and presenting them for the first time as a biographical study . The theme that runs through her book is the unchanging nature of man , the unchanging sense of danger Boccaccio wrote the Decameron , Datini never knew the terrors of high explosives and concentration camps , let alone the menace of the atomic bomb . In their place he had the Black Death , tyranny , piracy , the ruthless brutality of mercenary armies . He was the son of a Prato tavern-keeper ; by wise trading and prudent investment over a period of 32 years , he became rich enough to build his international business . <P> In those days a merchant often had to wait years before his expended capital came home with a profit .

Many a modern businessman will , in fact , find a good deal of himself reflected in Datini . He lived in a state of constant , wretched anxiety- " so vexed with many matters , " he groaned , " it is a wonder I am not out of my mind . ' ' When he slept , nightmares about a crumbling house destroyed his rest . <P> Often Datini sat up day and night , hardly pausing to eat or sleep , tirelessly writing reprimands to his partners , agents and factors throughout Europe , begging them to act prudently , to " trust no man . " Always , just as today , the last straw came in the form of taxation : " I shall see torn from me in my old age all that God has lent me . . . I have reached such a point that methinks , if a man stabbed me , no blood would issue forth ! "
