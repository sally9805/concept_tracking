Daddy Long Legs ( 20th Century-Fox ) is being breathlessly touted by the publicists as the picture in which Leslie Caron " for the first time bares her forehead . " As a matter of fact , when the bangs are brushed back , the lady 's forehead looks just about like everybody else 's . Still and all , it is probably the most unusual thing about this picture . <P> The third movie made from Jean Webster 's bestselling novel ( 1912 ) and hit play ( 1914 ) , Daddy Long Legs is the first to set the story to music ( by Johnny Mercer and Alex North ) . The saccharine story : a wealthy , middle-aged American ( Fred Astaire ) takes a fancy to a pretty young French orphan ( Leslie Caron ) and decides to pay her way through college in the U.S. Lest philanthropy be thought philandering , he keeps his identity a secret . Leslie knows him only from his shadow , seen once in an odd light , as " Daddy Long Legs . " However , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the man who pays the bill belongs the coo . <P> Fred and Leslie dance pretty well separately , but when they get together the ballerina looks about as comfortable in a two-step as Fred would in a tutu . The show has its moments , though . " Am I leading ? " asks a muscular young woman Fred is dancing with . " No , " he replies , breathing hard . " I think it 's a tie . " For the art lovers , there is a scene in which the camera respectfully inspects a series of paintings , genuine originals , by Jean Baptiste Corot , Raoul Dufy , Georges Braque , Pablo Picasso and Claudette Colbert . <P> Heartbreak Ridge ( Tudor Pictures ) is a rare piece of work by any standards . Filmed in color ( with English narration ) under the auspices of France 's Ministry of Defense , Heartbreak tells the story of the famed French battalion in Korea . The soldiers of the battalion are the cast , the actual 1952 battleground is the setting . The director and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not since John Huston 's San Pietro ( 1945 ) has a film shown in the U.S. come so close to capturing the painful reality of foxhole war . <P> But for all its **25;14528;TOOLONG quality , Heartbreak is far more than a newsreel . It threads its story on the trial-by-fire of young Lieut . Grard Garcet , a replacement starch-fresh from St. Cyr . At first Career Officer Garcet learns a basic lesson-war is mostly waiting . <P> At last , with spring , comes the call to action . Garcet takes the long jeep ride into combat , full of zeal and professional hopes ( " Promotions do not come to young lieutenants promenading on the Champs Elyses " ) . He soon learns that he is the New Boy at the Old School ; his fellow officers reminisce about when the war was really tough ; his hard-bitten platoon promptly dubs him " Battling Baby-Face . " <P> It takes Freshman Garcet several lonely months before he breaks through to acceptance , and he does it the hard way . In a successful dawn attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped out , and he is badly wounded . Back in the aid station , he hears from a dying platoon member the first words of greeting , eloquent in their sense of sudden loss : " I wish I had gotten to know you better . "
