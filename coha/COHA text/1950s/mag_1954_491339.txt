My , Three Years as a Dead Man By MAJ . GEN . WILLIAM F DEAN , USA , with wirrimil L. winyien For : 35 days the general was a hunted fugitive in the hills of South Korea . Then , certain lie was on his way to our lines , he was betrayed to the Beds  --  and had his first brain-washing . DURING the thirty-five days I spent in the hills of South Korea , several subjects cluttered my mind : fond , inability to tell time of day or day of month , worry over my aides and friends , and the frantic necessity for gett ing back to American lines with the information I now had about the enemy . These varied in importance from day to day , but all of them were there , all the time . So was an hour-to-hour , clay-after-day concern about a pistol and just twelve rounds of .45 ammunition . Those twelve rounds were the most important in the world , because they were all I had . When I lay in a rice paddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought the time had come when I 'd have to use the ammunition . Tabor was n't behind me , where I thought , and did n't catch up . I had come to the edge of the paddy , where there was a stream and a path heckle it , but still he didn't. come . I called , " Tabor ! Tabor ! " but the only answer was from a communist soldier standing on a dike . He fired at the sound of my voice . I could n't imagine what had happened to Tabor . We 'd been coming very well , inching forward on our elbows and bellies , and there had been no firing or sounds of pursuit . When the soldier fired , I clung to the ground beside a dike and look out my pistol . I knew I 'd see the soldier 's silhouette on the dike in the dim dawn before he saw me . But he must have realized this , because he never came closer . I waited quite a while ; then called , " Tabor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shots . After hall an hour , I crawled back so I could look into the last paddy cell we had crossed , but Tabor was n't there either . Now it was almost full daylight , and my advantage over the communists hunting me was gone . I felt like a sheep-stealing dog , but I had to go on . I crawled down the path and finally found some foxholes dug by the communists for a roadside ambush . I crawled into one of those , past . watermelon rinds the diggers had thrown around . ( I 've never figured exactly what happened to Tabor . It 's hard to crawl in a straight line with your bead down , and he may have changed direction . But I do n't think he was captured that day . I learned in 1953 that he had been brought into Taejon as a prisoner on August . 4 , 1950 . So 1 think he lasted several days . Tabor was wounded by one of our own strafing planes while being marched north from Taejon , and died front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this foxhole than I saw a farmer . Thank God , he was coming from the other direction , not the village , with a girl about three years old on his back . He saw me , so I got up and made signs  --  the word " pop " ( made with a sharper sound than in English ) means " rice . " I said , " Pop , " and placed n hand on my stomach . It worked . He signaled me to get back down in the hole . In about an hour he returned with a big howl of rice . What I could n't eat , I wrapped in half my map ? the North Korean half . in which I was not at all interested just then . Then I crouched in the hole and took out the pistol . It would not fire , even empty , so I spent the day cleaning it .. There were just the twelve rounds of ammunition in two clips . Then and later , I was torn by indecision : I 'd burnish those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep one always in the chamber and one clip full or put half of them in each clip and depend on being able to change in the middle of a fight . Neither system could really insure that I 'd be able to use eleven for knocking out communists and one for knocking out Dean . I 've always thought . it was an ignominious thing for a soldier to say " Kamerad " , and even if I personally could have stomached the idea , I knew the communists would be sure to capitalize on the surrender of a general , just as we had in Europe . I remember that once we captured an SS general who had become lost , and immediately our propaganda people told the Germans in leaflets and broadcasts that he 'd just realized it was " a quarter of twelve " and surrendered deliberately . That was n't going to happen to Dean  --  not if Bullet No. 12 could prevent it . Learning About Rice : the First Lesson I STAYED in t he hole all day . That night the farmer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my saved rice , he grimaced and threw it away . When you want to keep cooked rice , you wrap it in a cloth so it can " breathe . " In a tight paper , it sours within hours . I was to learn a lot about rice eventually , and that was the first lesson . I started walking after dark , still on my project of getting south , then east . But . I kicked myself for being without a compass . Traveling at night , I could not use the sun effectively , nor get a bearing front my stopped watch . Many nights the stars were obscured , so I went by guess-reckoning , and often it was wrong . I think I made almost a complete circle in the next few nights . But I did feel better . I could rise by myself now , and the dysentery which had bothered me during the first twenty days in Korea was gone . In fact , my elimination came to a complete stop for thirty-t " o days . I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . doctors said only that anything under a hundred days was nothing to brag about . On the night of what I think was August first , I was in the mountains , approaching what I thought was Kumsan , and in early evening I passed women working in the fields . As I went by , I noticed that a little boy of about nine was following . I went over a rise and slipped into some bushes , and thought I had eluded him : so , after some time , I went on , reaching a hill overlooking the town . I picked out a house detached from the others and decided that when dark came , I 'd ask there for food . I had n't eaten since I saw that farmer . But just as I got to my feet to go down and try panhandling , a youth came out of this house and ran up the hill ? and he had a rifle . In a minute another came out and also ran up the hill , very fast . Then at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in uniform , but I could n't tell whether they were armed . I hunched down and was just congratulating myself because they appeared headed in the wrong direction , when I heard a rustling behind me . Here was this same nine-year-old , pointing down at me and trying to signal to the men . He was no more than six feet from me . I lunged at him . I 'm afraid I was n't very pleasant . I really cussed him out . He turned and ran , and I pulled out of there fast and going the other way . Behind me there was shooting , and somebody yelled as if he 'd been hit , but Dean was on his way . When I 'd come to Korea , I had hoped I soon would be a grandfather , but I did n't feel grandfatherly then . If I could , I 'd have wrung that moth-eaten little buzzard 's neck . And I still was hungry . On the trail the next day I ran into a Korean man . Again I asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me  --  just stalked away as if I did n't exist . That night I saw another village and went ( Gm t ' ed on Page 47 ) Y THREE YEARS AS A DEAD MAN ( 0 ) 1t1 al front Page 23 ) down close to it But as I watched , at least ten big North Korean tanks rumbled into town  --  so that was no place for me . I got better at sleeping by daylight and traveling by night , but I still was n't making much progress . Those mountain trails wind so that you cover miles to make a little distance . I was walking more easily , although my abdomen still hurt and I could n't raise my left arm , but I was n't suffering . By this time I 'd changed my first objective to Chonju . I thought there South Koreans might give me a ride to Pusan on the extreme southern route if I could n't get to Taegu . But the trails were too slow , so I got down on the roads , off the ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , I 'd circle around it through the hills , although this was frustrating and took endless time . But about three nights after my first experience with the small boy , I started walking early in the evening and saw a village ahead . I should have started circling , but I was a little overconfident . Then I met another little boy . This one was five or six years old . As soon as he saw me , he turned tail and ran back to the village as fast as he could , screaming as if his end had come . I have never heard any other little boy scream the way he did . Well , I knew what that would mean , so I hurried after him , almost running myself . At the edge of town , I jumped off into a ditch and a bunch of weeds . Sure enough , here came all the males in town . I saw one rifle and one burp gun , and other men had bamboo spears . They all followed the boy back along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he 'd seen me ? then fanned out and began hunting . Fortunately , the town lay between a hid and kaffir-corn fields . Beyond the kaffir was a stream , so I crawled through the fields to it ; then along it in the same direction I 'd originally been going . The last I saw of that town , men were still heating the weeds and all the women v , are standing on the main street waiting for somebody to find me . I still did n't like little boys . Most of the time , however , I walked right through these villages in the night . Even when it was pitch-black , I had no trouble knowing they were there . You can always smell a Korean town . You can always recognize the police stations , too , because they 're built alike  --  an eight-foot wall around a compound , double wooden gates at the front and a twenty-foot tower , like a silo , inside . I usually ignored them . But at two I ' lad close calls . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but paid no attention to it . Then , just as I passed the gates , someone challenged me from the shadows , seven or eight feet away . He yelled a word which must have meant " Halt ! " I had no warning , and he startled me . He scared me half to death at J made me mad too  --  at him and at myself for carelessness . I did a foolish thing . I whirled and yanked out my pistol , walking right toward him . He was just a youngster armed with a rifle with a long bayonet . I shoved my pistol right in his guts , hard , and he backed up . I backed him right through the gate . Just as he got inside , I turned and walked rapidly in the direction I 'd been ' I'I SaTtl RIMY going . It was only a few yards to the corner of the compound . I turned that , went all the way to the back , then along it and once more to the road on the side from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yelling as the guard gave the alarm , and a squad poured into the street , but they went the way the guard had seen me go . I walked on back the way I 'd come . I 'd noticed a fork in the road there and took the other prong , once again heading in the general direction I wanted . I think that guard was just rushed off his feet . If he 'd ever got that damned rifle up on his shoulder , I 'd have killed him right there . But he did n't even try . The other close call was also in the middle of the night . This time I stumbled into a town ? and into a little charcoal fire out in front of the police station . There had been a guard post there , I guess , and I walked right into their fire . But if there were people around , they never saw me ; nothing happened . All the village dogs barked , of course , but they bothered me less than the mountain dogs  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have the most ferocious hark I 've heard . It 's really a bloodthirsty sound , more like a wild animal than a dog , so I stayed away from those huts . I also was afraid of the charcoal people . Many had been Red sympathizers , even in the old days . I was afraid to trust them , even when I was starving . My equipment was getting in had shape . I was wearing an oversized pair of coveralls , acquired by accident , and combat hoots which chafed the top of one foot . I had reading glasses , a watch that did n't work , a fountain pen which did , forty dollars in United States scrip , which nobody wanted , and the pistol . Of course I had no rain gear , so I got wet . I was also getting dangerously hungry . Korean police in guerrilla campaigns had burned most of the isolated houses there , and I was afraid of the villages . Obviously , the communists had organized the whole place . A few youths in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they were itching to shoot . I could n't afford any more risks . I also found it did n't pay to start walking early in the evening , to walk too far into the dawn . In the evenings , children were all around the towns , and in the dawns , old men would come out ? perhaps they were like me and had trouble sleeping late ? to look over the fields . During the days , brush-gathering parties always worked the untitled areas , hunting grass and brambles for cooking fires and smudges against the mosquitoes . In the evening each village looks as if it were on fire  --  a sort of little Pittsburgh under its own pall of smoke from the grass smudges . One morning I stopped to bathe in a river . When I got out , women were already coming down to wash clothes , so I had to crawl into some bushes about fifty yards From them . I could n't sleep that day for fear children would find me . Across the river and back a bit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians were reporting to a police station . But the washerwomen had come from behind me , so I assumed there must be another village on my side of the stream . Three or four paths converged , and all the women did their washing at the same spot . I got through the day , but that evening one woman left the riverbank with a big bundle of clothes on her head , and came straight up another path I had n't seen , passing within four EVENING POST feet of me . She looked right at me ? hut if I had a face like hers I could make a million dollars playing poker . Not a muscle twitched . She just kept on walking . I was still trying to decide whether she could possibly have failed to see me when my question was answered by two young men who came from the direction she had gone . They saw me , so I asked for food . They answered , very softly , " O.K. , O.K. , " and signaled to me to stay down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back the way they had come . I thought , Boy , after a long time , I 'm in luck again . The next thing I knew , there was a hell of a commotion and rifle shots started coming over my head . This was an old , overgrown orchard . When I looked , I could see a raised path beyond it , parallel to the river , and houses beyond the path . When the shooting started , so did a lot of yelling , and in the end , that saved me . My two chums had brought out the local forces , and I saw men all around me in a half circle , starting to close in toward the river and me . I also saw all the women and children in the world , standing up there on the raised path to watch the fun . But it was a funny thing . I went to sleep between close-ins . I 'd wake up with a start and think , Dean , you damned fool , you ca n't sleep this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . Then I 'd doze off again . But finally , I did wake up enough to start crawling . They 'd known where I was , but I faded back toward the river and upstream . They handed me one advantage , because every time a man in the closing ring would take a few steps , he 'd yell like mad , so everybody would know where he was . Once a man yelled just as I was about to crawl toward his spot . I waited , and he went on past me . It was just dumbness on their part ; I slipped through the circle . They were still yelling at one another when I got on the road and went away from there . I worried a lot ? about 1 he division , my own family , families of men I knew were dead or thought . were dead . I prayed sometimes , too , for these families . When I dreamed , however , it was mostly about food . I thought , When I get back to headquarters and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll say , " Now , just a minute . First , bring me one of those fruit components from a ten-in-one ration . I want one of those cans of plums or apricots in that thick , sugary sirup . Then I 'll tell you all about it . " I could just see that can of fruit . One night I walked in a pouring rain , making wonderful Lime . But in the morning I realized I 'd been walking the wrong way all night , so I took to the hills and walked back all day . The next night I told myself , Damn it , you 're walking in circles , you 're wasting time ; you 've got to get back to division . You go straight east until you hit the railroad , then follow it south , no matter how tough it is . That sounds good , but it was awfully tough . Those mountains are steep , really very tiresome . That night I was resting on a trail when I heard a clatter . Before I could even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I had raised my head his hoofs would have clipped me . I also wasted whole days looking for water . For food , I tried kaffir stalks and grass , both of which made me throw up . When I got weaker , I even threw up what water I did find . But on August ( Continued on Page 50 ) THE SATURDAY EIINN INC POST Jalsomry 3411 , ( ( ' om most fnan Page 17 ) nineteenth , I finally located a house in Ile mountains , away from any village . When I spotted it itt night , I just . lay down in the path and slept . In the morning I wits awakened by another man carrying a little girl on his back . Again I asked for food  --  and my luck was in , finally . He led me to the house , and the whole family his three younger brothers , plus his own and one brother 's wife and children  --  came out to greet me . They brought food right out into the yard ? rice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them I wanted to stay there four days . I thought , Just give me four days ' rest , and I 'll make it . They took me to a lean-to , built against the hack of the house and infested with thousands of flies . I went right in , flopped down and fought flies . But I stayed only five minutes . Then I had to crawl to the door , and everything I 'd eaten came up . This was August twentieth . and the last food I 'd eaten had been on - July t wenly-tift h or twenty-sixth . In this period I had found about a hundred berries , all told , and four shriveled Irish potatoes in an abandoned field , but no other food . At noon the family gave me more rice , with kinwhee , and again I threw it up . I tried to indicate that I wanted eggs , but they misunderstood and killed a chicken . That chicken soup was wonderful , and I kept it down . The next , day I had rice , roasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the beginning , I could tell that the second brother was n't happy about me . In Korean and sign language he kept talking about the ? " Inman Gun , " but indicated surprise when I said I had no desire to see the communist People 's Army . Perhaps he thought I was a Russian before that , but afterward he was increasingly nervous . On the second day the brothers brought an old man to look me over . I figured this was some old hanabap , or wise man , they 'd hunted up , for advice . I also thought the signs were n't good . So I gave my watch to the younger brother , my pen and the outer part of my billfold to the older . But that evening the older brother told me I had to go  --  I do n't think they loved the Inmun Gun , but were just afraid of it . He gave me four ears of parched corn and some rice in a cloth , and led me on a path about half a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was black dark , and I stepped in a hole and fell on my face . Perhaps it was reaction , but I was more tired than I 'd ever been . So I just flopped in the trail and went to sleep . / was n't low in my mind , just tired . I could tell when this man had left me that he thought I was n't going to make it . I could tell by his look that he thought , You poor devil , you 're finished . But I thought , Well , you sad character , you just do n't know . I 'm going to surprise you . I am going to make it . In the morning the very unhappy younger brother found me there , and led me another half mile to where we could see the main highway about ten miles across a valley . I went on alone again . But as I was walking along the trail , I heard a commotion ahead . A whole gang of boys were beating peach trees in the orchard at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they left , I managed to fill my pockets with what they 'd overlooked  --  wizened , half ripe and the size of walnuts . But they were food . I began to make time . I walked all one day , and the parched corn made me feel so good I walked all night too . But once more , a day or so later , I walked too long . I was on a line highway , which I was sure had been built with ECA money ; so I thought . the villagers should like us . Daylight caught me opposite one little town . I went into some brush under chestnut trees leas than half a mile from it . I slept in the morning , but in the afternoon an old man and some boys came through with sickles , cutting brush . I walked right up and asked for food in sign language , and they steered me to the town . I thought , Well , things are breaking my way now . So just ride my luck . I stopped at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back yard . His wife put some rice on to cook , while I sat and watched the man work . Then she brought the rice , with garlic heads , and I ate it all and asked for more to wrap in my handkerchief . I left there about five o'clock , walking up the ECA road . I 'd gone only a little distance when a small Korean passed me . He got about twenty feet . ahead , suddenly stopped and waited ; then walked along beside me without , saying a word . I asked him questions about t he route to Taegu and other cities , and when we stopped to rest , he drew a map in the dirt . I was beginning to be impressed with this fellow , so I made the same offer I had once before  --  a million won to guide me to Taegu . I still think he tried to tell me the communist army was at Chaim. ) , but that he would take me right past it safely . Presently we had to ford a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should have suspected something then , becauge he was very anxious to carry my pistol for me  --  although I did n't let him . On the other side , at the entrance to a village , we were met by a crowd of Koreans , led by a ferocious-looking fellow carrying a club . He signaled to us to go back ; that we could n't come through town . But I pulled my pistol and threatened them with it , and the crowd backed up slowly . All the time , this fellow beside me was talking , and I thought , He 's fast-talking them . We went right on through town , but in a few minutes a second Korean caught up with us . I realize now this was the character who had headed the village mob , but I did n't recognize him without his club . Han , the fellow I thought . was guiding me , indicated t hat this was his churn . We three walked along together until we reached a bend in the road . There , Han @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me to hide . I thought , Boy , this is bad , and hit the bushes , pulling out my pistol . But Han went on ahead ; then came back in a minute . " O.K. , O.K. , " he said . I thought , This boy is all right . This is working out fine . Around the bend were fifty or a hundred men , filling holes in the road . We walked right past them ; nobody interfered . Then when we came to another bend , Han did the same thing all over again : the " Inman Gun ! " warning , Dean in the ditch , then an all-clear . This time the working party included two men with rifles ; my spine felt uncomfortable , but again nothing happened . I thought , This Han is a pretty good buy . He is going to take me through . But I should have been warned by a couple of things . One was , Han was in a tearing hurry . He said he was hungry . But we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we started again , however , we went only to a little house beside the road . I understood they wanted to stop there for food , but when we got inside we were served sake , and only garlic heads to eat . I ate the garlic , but had only one tiny glass of sake , although they kept urging me to have more . I did think , What are these guys trying to do ? get inc drunk ! , but I still was n't suspicious . A third man joined us in the house and went along when we left . We went through the same Inman Gun , hide-inditch routine a third time ? but this time a little town was ahead . We went on through , but just as we got on the far side , someone yelled behind us . Once again I got down , while Han and his second friend went to talk ? this time to our rear . Then Han called something to this fellow who had stayed with me , and he indicated I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of the road , with my feet hanging over the edge of a fill above a stream . The night was warm , the moonlight beautiful . All of a sudden around the corner from the village came about fifteen men , and somebody shot over our heads . I got my hand on my pistol , but this little devil sitting beside me grabbed my wrist with both his hands . I struggled to my feet with him still hanging on , but I could n't get the gun out . We fell and rolled around in the dirt as I tried to get him to the edge of the fill , so I could push him over and break his hold . But the gang only had about twenty-five feet to rush us ? they were already on top of us . About three rifle barrels were on my head and kept bumping mess we wrestled . It was very annoying . They were yelling , but I kept on fighting this fellow and trying to kick somebody . I yelled , " Shoot , shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hought , This is an ignominious way to have your lights put out , but this is it . Then half a dozen of them were twisting both my arms , and that shoulder of mine really hurt , . But even the physical pain wasn't. half so bad as the thought , Well , these miserable devils have you as a prisoner . They tied both hands behind me , so tightly that the circulation was cut off . Then they jerked me to my feet and shoved me toward the town . But I would n't walk . I indicated I could n't , so finally they took the bonds clear off . Then I tried to run . I wanted them to shoot me . I was so weak I could n't have made more than a yard . or so , took all these and reached into my shirt pocket . I wear a partial denture , but it had been hurting , so I was carrying it there in my pocket . About the only smart thing I did was to grab that , pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into my mouth , fast . I knew that if they ever saw how much gold was in that thing , I 'd never get it back . While they were searching me , I was in front of a desk , and behind the desk was a Korean calendar with Arabic numerals . I pointed to that , and one of the men put his finger on the figure 25 . It was the twenty-fifth day of August , my wedding anniversary . ( Han Doo Kyoo , forty , and Choe Chang Bong , twenty-four , were arrested by Korean police in September , 1953 , and accused as my betrayers . Police said the pair received the equivalent of five dollars for turning me in . A third man , Pak Chong Kyoo , joined the guerrilla forces and was reported to have been killed in 1952 . As this is written , Han and Choe await trial . I have written , asking clemency if they are convicted . ) I spent that night literally in a cage . This was in a corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height , but was built like an L , so I could sit in one position , but . could neither lie down nor stand up . Foolishly , I took off my combat boots and asked that they be aired outside . This was greeted with enthusiasm , and of course I never saw my hoots again . The next morning , I was fed ; then put in charge of a walking guard and a civilian on a bicycle , who took me to an Inman Gun company headquarters in Chinon , where a captain was already busily cleaning my pistol  --  and admiring the twelve well-burnished rounds of ammunition which I never had a chance to use . He ordered up more food ? boiled pork fat again . I was hungry enough to eat that like candy , to eat . He even sent out for a bag of ginger cookies and gave those to me for dessert . diers in the area cattle to her classes . Nobody bothered to question me , however , and in the evening I was put aboard a truck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a few guards . I was pushed into the middle of the crowd , with knees in my back , someone sitting on my ankles , somebody else on my feet . This was a truck like our t wo-and-a-half-ton Army truck ? may even have been one about ten miles out , we stopped again ; and across paddy dikes came a line of men with wrists tied , and roped together . I counted twenty more getting ( Continued on Page 52 ) // ( Coolioord from Page 50 ) in the truck , then lost track , but I think there were twice that number . They just got in on top of the rest of us . The truck started , hut . fortunately ? otherwise somebody would have been smothered ? was n't able to make the hills with that load , so some of the last crowd were finally taken off . With the remainder , we went all the way to Chonju , arriving in the middle of an air raid . Finally , we were taken to the provincial penitentiary  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I once had inspected it while I was military governor  --  and lined up , with all our belongings spread out in front of us . I had only some of the cookies and a handkerchief . I hurriedly ate the cookies , finally talked the guard into letting me keep the handkerchief . I was marched all to a huge cell all by myself , and put inside it . At one side there were twenty wooden pillows for the normal complement of prisoners . So I chose one and lay down on the floor . As a Berkeley policeman many years before , I had escorted quite a few people to jail for a night , but this was the first time I 'd been locked in a cell myself . In the morning I was taken to the commandant 's office . He was a handsome man , wearing North Korean blue breeches and black boots , but a civilian shirt and coat . He also had green eyes  --  the only green-eyed Korean I 've ever seen  --  and needed a shave . But he was friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A chap with long hair  --  and needing a shave even worse than the commandant ? did the interpreting and said the commandant had not known I was an officer , but would make amends now ? I 'd get a bath , a shave and some decent clothes . Then he asked a question , " Where was fthee , Syngman ? " That was Question No . I of some thousands to be asked , and it made no more and no less sense than most of them . As always , question and harangue went right together . The corn mandant said , " You must go on the radio and tell your family that you are well ; that you are being well treated and there is no use in continuing the war . Tell them the people of South Korea have welcomed us as their brothers . You must do this for the sake of your family and friends , and to save the lives of your countrymen . " There was more of this . I said I had no idea where Syngman Rhee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? in answer to a question  --  we had come to Korea " to repel the aggressors from the north , who had violated the national territory of the south , that it was our duty as a member of the United Nations to assist in repelling that invasion . " I gave him quite a speech . He said , " Well , now you can see how your forces have been driven hack , so , if you were released , would you continue to fight us ? " He already had told me we 'd lost Taegu and that the fall of Pusan was a matter of hours . I said , " Yes , that 's what I want to do . That 's why I 've been trying to get back , so I could fight again . I know I can do better next time and kill more of you for the men we lose . " He said , " General , you 're a brave man , but you 're very ignorant politically . " That ended the politics , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Well , I 've seen you before , general . I was a political prisoner here in this same prison when you inspected it as military governor . But I 'm going to treat you better than you treated me . " I got my shower , a haircut and shave  --  also sat for some very carefully posed " before " and " a f ter " photographs . The photographer said , " You 'll be amazed at the difference . " I 'm sure I would have been , and would love to have those photos now . I I had glimpsed myself in a mirror that day and realized I was probably the ugliest man in the world with a beard . From my left chin , it comes out black , but there 's a white tuft on the right side and a bare spot in the middle . ) That day I also learned that the interpreter was a prisoner . He had been , he said , an employee of our military government in Taejon and would be tried for having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " I know the trial will be fair and I think I 'll be freed , because now I realize my mistakes . " He also said he thought I 'd see the light , after I had some political education . I was taken to a cottage outside the prison walls , given a cot with a mattress , pillows and even sheets , and had an excellent noon meal . Then I was called hack to the warden 's office , and this time half a dozen men in civilian clothes also were there . I thought I 'd seen some of the faces before . Their first question was " How can you prove that you 're General Dean ? " I said I was n't interested in proving it  --  and then we went into a series which was to become familiar : Why did the Americans come over here ? Why do Americans bomb innocent women and children ? Why do they hit peasants in the fields ? Churches ? Schools ? I said one of the reasons was that the communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the churches and schools for command posts . Then my questioner said , " We wo n't discuss that any more . " The whole thing ended with several of them giving me lectures accusing the United States of exploiting South Korea and preventing unification . When I asked the interpreter who these people were , he said they were the press  --  and then I remembered where I 'd seen some of those faces . They were hecklers in the old days of military government , the ones who always gave me trouble in press conferences . I felt better . I felt sure now that the word would get out through the press , and my family would know I was alive . That cot with the mattress looked wonderful , and I was expecting a night 's sleep to make up for some of those in the mountains . But . I was premature . I was restless , and every time the cot squeaked , the youngsters guarding me would shout about it . Then , in the middle of the night , my dysentery started again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for many nights thereafter , that was the minimum . The maximum reached some thirty-six trips a day . There 's one thing about Dean 's digestion : it never does anything halfway . It either does n't work at all or all the time . I had more questioning the next day ? this time by a major general . He had a guard with a submachine gun in the room to protect . him while I was there , and the result was curious . He had asked me again about the bombing of civilians . I said , " We 're not in the business of bombing civilians  --  we 're far too busy working on military targets . " Well , I do n't know how that was interpreted , but it infuriated the young guard . He snarled and jumped forward , pointing his submachine gun at me . He was so excited and upset that I laughed . I said to the general , " What 's the matter with him ? Does he want to shoot me ? " The general then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , To me , he said , " The guard 's very young , but he is moved and greatly disturbed by the barbarities your army has committed against his countrymen . " I still wonder what the interpreter had told them in Korean . I also was amused during this interview to realize that our names and numbers can confuse the enemy almost as much as the many Paks and Kirns confuse us . Many questions concerned happenings on the east coast or involved Negro troop units . Finally I realized this general had me confused with Maj. Gen. William Kean , of the ? 26th Division , and was hopelessly fouled up between the 24th Regiment , part of that division , and the 24th Division , which I commanded . The next morning a doctor came . He thumped my chest very thoroughly , listened to my breathing , and for my dysentery , left what I think was bismuth and salts . In the evening the warden came to the cottage to announce I was on my way north . When I complained about having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his  --  the most odoriferous American GI shoes I ever smelled , and too tight , but still better than what I 'd had . All the Prison officials came out to hid me good-by. like an old friend , as I left in a truck with three guards and an officer . Planes and troop movements  --  I noticed good march discipline , but also that only half the marching men had weapons  --  delayed our trip to Taejon . In the city I was pleased to see five knocked-out tanks , as mementos of our last day there , but not so pleased when I saw the markings on furniture in the office where I was taken . Most of it was marked : " Medical Battalion , 24th Infantry Division . " One thing amazed me while I sat there . Every time the officer in charge would leave the room , an enlisted guard would calmly go through his desk , look into drawers , rifle papers and help himself to cigarettes . When the soldier was busy doing this , I reached over to a jar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I figured that if it was missed , the guard would he blamed . Even when the officer was in the room , the enlisted man helped himself to the officer 's cigarettes , just as he might do to his best buddy 's supply . I found out , that this was a regular practice in the Inman Gun . Perhaps it 's part of the communist theory that private property is wrong . That night , I started north again , with a new escort  --  and in a 24th Division military-police jeep . Behind the wheel was one of the world 's rare drivers . In the People 's Army the driver of a vehicle seems to he undisputed king , an officer just a passenger who gives no orders . This particular driver reminded me of a drugstore sheik of the 1920 ' 8 . His lank hair hung down to his chin , and to get it out of his eyes , he 'd throw hack his head , whirl it and let the hair flop more or less into place . All this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed . Each time I was sure he 'd go off the road , but he did n't until we were almost at Suwon . There , he whirled his head once too often , we bounced over the debris from a wrecked tank and blew all four tires . We finished the night with a two-mile walk into town . We had breakfast at a hotel in Suwon , but afterward the escort officer went away by himself , and I guess the guards decided it was too much trouble to watch me all morning , so they took me down to a building where TID  --  I SATURDAY at least thirty Korean civilian prisoners were wedged into one eight-by-tenfoot room , under guard . I was put in with them . Almost . immediately , a little boy of about Fourteen spoke to me in English .
