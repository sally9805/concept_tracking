txt Premier Abdul Karim Kassim declared tonight that Iraq had " freed " herself from " imperialism " by " crushing " the Baghdad Pact and withdrawing from the Eisenhower Doctrine . " Imperialism wanted to disunite the people , make them wade in pools of blood and see one group strike the other , " General Kassim declared in a Illation-wide radio speech , his first major pronouncement since he was wounded in an assassination attempt Oct. 7 . The Premier attributed that attack and " other plots " hitherto undisclosed to " imperialists . " " Imperialism wanted to crush this republic , which has become Immortal , " he said . Premier Kassim said his Government so far had disposed of all plots against it , " including some that we have crushed ' without the knowledge of the people . " " We have crushed the Baghdad Pact military bases that lie prone on the soil of our homeland , and liberated our national economy by withdrawing from the sterling area , " he said . " We have withdrawn from the Eisenhower Doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves , General Kassim said , have made " the economy of our country strong and our wealth great . " The speech was one of the Premier 's most openly antiWestern pronouncements to date , even though it never directly referred to the Western powers by name . The Baghdad Pact , which General Kassim said he had " crushed , " was a pro-Western defense organization that included Iraq , Britain , Iran , Pakistan and Turkey as members and the United States as an observer and close affiliate . When Iraq withdrew last May , the pact was reorganized under Ithe name of Central Treaty Organization . The Eisenhower Doctrine , formulated by the President early in 1957 , was a plan for providing United States military aid and moral encouragement to any Middle East nation threatened with aggression . The sterling area , from which Premier Kassim said his country had been " liberated , " was a reference to Britain 's long years of association with Iraq ? a tie loosened by the July , 1958 , revolt that put General Kassim in power .

" Be sure that since the first moment of planning the revolution we have taken into account imperialist plots " Western fears that his Government , after tottering dangerously on the borderline between nationalism and communism , had swerved toward the latter . The Premier used the speech to prove to the Iraqi people that he had made good recovery from the wounds he received in the assassination attempt . Premier Kassim said that his wounds were healed and that he was in good health . He coupled his denunciation of " imperialists " who " try to ; liquidate decent persons " with1 a report on his health . His re-I port was expected to touch off , rejoicing in the country .
