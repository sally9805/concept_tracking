" Such is the inhumanity of man to chimpanzees . <P> Von Felden 's pet chimps are among the best of dozens of characters in A Legacy , a first novel that British critics rated as the richest windfall of 1956 . Clearly , Author Bedford has written not only a good novel but one that touches her contemporaries in a vital , highly sensitive nerve . That nerve is the anguished one of old Europe . A Legacy describes the Victorian and Edwardian heyday when well-to-do men and women wandered without let or hindrance in a network of social connections that ran from the tip of Scotland to the toe of Italy .

When Melanie dies ( of tubercular tedium ) , Julius leaves their daughter to be raised by the kindly Merzes , and marries an Englishwoman who is kind to his pets . The stalemated wanderings begin again : soon the cosmopolitan millpond is covered with the crisscrossing tracks of society 's idle , discontented water beetles .
