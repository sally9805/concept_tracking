and this opportunity , but he had very little time ? only a dozen years from the summer day in 1926 when he started Look Homeward , Angel . During those years he worked like a man possessed ? " like a fiend , " he kept saying in his letters ? always with the feeling that time was the enemy he had to outwit . He was trying , as Proust had done , to rescue his whole experience from time and give it a permanent meaning . Just how much , he accomplished is not a question that is answered in this volume of letters . There is another question , however , on which the letters cast some new light ; it is the meaning of his early death and whether it was an accident or , a tragedy . Most of , his friends seem to regard it as both of these and , at the same time , as a blow to the future of American letters . " That is the real tragedy ? for us , " says Wolfe 's last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He had just come into the fullness of his powers when he died . " Miss Nowell 's introductions to the letters ends in almost the same fashion : " The tragedy , of course , is that the story is unfinished ? that his death at the age of 37 has left us only to speculate on what he might have come to , had he lived . " But is " tragedy " the right word for an unfinished story and for a death that intervened as these friends imply ? on a sunny day like a random bolt of lightning ? The end of a tragedy is written in the beginning . The death of a tragic hero is the result of a choice he has made , in which he persists at the cost of his own destruction . WOLFE too ' had made a choice , and V V there are some indications that his career was , a tragedy in the more accurate sense of the word . The letters , of his last two years abound in confidence that at last he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note of exhaustion and discouragement . " I am desperately tired and need a rest , " he said in letter after letter . In June , 1937 , he explained to his brother that writing is " a desperate , back-breaking , nerve-wracking and brain-fatiguing labor . . . I am not just pretending I am tired-1 am , actually , honestly and genuinely , physically and mentally . " The summer in Asheville gave him no relief . " I went home a very tired man , " he reported later , not only with all this trouble of Scribner 's gnawing , but the pressure and accumulation of everything that has happened in the past two years . And when I left home I was as near to a breakdown as I have ever been . " There would be no rest for him until May of the following year , when he started on his first and last trip to the Northwest . Meanwhile , among his complaints of nervous fatigue , there were hints of another feeling that he must have hesitated to confess : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being exliausted . " No matter how great a man 's material may be , it has its limits , " he had said in one of his unmailed letters to . Perkins . " You say that you have been worried about my being able to control my vast masses of material . May I tell you that in the past year one of my chief and constantly growing anxieties has been whether I shall have any material left that I could use if you continue to advise against my present use of it . " His complaint had this much truth in it , that any sort of critical disapproval , even the mildest , was likely to shut off the " torrential reco/lectiveness , " as he called it , that was the basis ' of his literary activity . Yet even if nothing halted the flow of words , they came from a reservoir , not a river , and it might never be refilled . As he grew older he was moving farther from the source of his inspira tion , as many other writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelists that has been appearing in The Paris Review , I have noticed that one after another speaks of his childhood as the basis of all his work , past and future . Said Francois Mauriac , for example , " It is as though when I was twenty -a door inside me had closed forever on that which was going to become the material of my work . " Said Graham Greene , " The creative writer perceives his world once and for all in childhood and adolescence , and his whole career is an effort to illustrate his private world in terms of the great public world we all share . " C ONSIDERING his dependence on what he remembered , Wolfe was lucky that his adolescence , with its intense perceptions , lasted much longer than it does with most writers . There are signs , however , that the common fate was overtaking him at the end , that his per ceptions were becoming a little blunted and his memories less poignant . He was less interested in new adventures because , with the wisdom of approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
