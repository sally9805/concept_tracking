At midseason 1958 , it was evident that in the whole U.S. , there was no powerhouse capable of rolling over all comers in the Army-Oklahoma-Notre Dame tradition . Each time one team seemed headed for unbeaten , untied supremacy , some upstart has cut it down to size . In a season of healthy chaos , TIME 'S Top Ten : <P> 1 ) Iowa ( 4-0-1 ) - tied only by the Air Force its second time out , whipped Northwestern 26-20 to become the leading contender for the Big Ten title . <P> 2 ) Wisconsin ( 3-1-1 ) - played favored Ohio State off its feet to gain a 7-7 tie . <P> 3 ) Ohio State ( 4-0-1 ) - lucky to escape defeat as Wisconsin botched two late chances to win . <P> 4 ) Oklahoma ( 4-1 ) - proficient as usual in plundering Kansas State 40-6 . <P> 5 ) Army ( 4-0-1 ) - with a damaging lack of depth exposed by a battling Pitt team two-deep at every position , its tired first string was obviously glad to settle for a 14-14 tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> 6 ) Pittsburgh ( 4-1-1 ) - contained Army 's offense ( statistically the nation 's best ) , dominated the second half with a wide-open attack . <P> 7 ) Louisiana State ( 6-0 ) - only unbeaten-untied member of the Top Ten , needed a field goal in the last three minutes to get past Florida 10-7 . <P> 8 ) Auburn ( 4-0-1 ) - defensively solid , set up two touchdowns with pass interceptions , beat Maryland 20-7 . <P> 9 ) Purdue ( 4-1 ) - stifled a late rally to upset fading Notre Dame 29-22 . <P> 10 ) California ( 4-2 ) - dumped Oregon 23-6 to stay unbeaten in Pacific Coast Conference play , edge closer to a spot in the Rose Bowl New Year 's Day .
