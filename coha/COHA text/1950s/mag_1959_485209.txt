A CHILD , after he has done wrong , been caught , and while he is being punished by prolonged disapproval ( psychiatrically , a poor way to punish ) , has a long , sad , lonely and highly moral vigil . Theoretically his views on life in this period should be of great value , but in fact he is only re-collecting his ego , not probing into the moral law . His mood is rather beautiful in a minor key , but useful neither to him nor to society . This childhood poetry is repeated and multiplied in all the prisons of all the nations , though with differences . In America , the state and federal correctional institutions-immureat any one time about 200,000 people , mostly men . This is about .1 per cent of the whole population  --  about one in every 250 men . Each costs the taxpayer about $1,800 a year , directly . The prisons , it is said by everybody including the prisoners , are failures . The worst failure of prisons is that they do not yet contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from the present inmates . It takes forty years to catch up with a Frank Costello and separate him briefly from his manicurist and the Copacabana night club . The ' members of his organization rarely experience the long , sweet sorrow ? of prison life . The actual prisoner has not thought to the point about life ; Costello his ; and the convicted criminal should ' not flatter himself that . he is in Costello 's class merely because he is a criminal . The prisons are for the failures ; perhaps that is why the prisons are failures . Both are , however , very expensive failures , and so we must be grateful for a recent authentic ' revelation of the nature of the actual man now in prison in America . This took the form of a privileged poll of 500 prisoners of the Atlanta , Ga. , Penitentiary by the prisoners , themselves . The results appear under the title " Project Prisoner " in a special issue of The Atlantian , the inmates ' own magazine . Since Atlanta has 2,700 prisoners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of criminals are roughly the same as for the total prison population . It soon becomes apparent in the tabulations that the results are meaningless when they are measured as of the whole 500 , as if all kinds of criminals were alike . For surely a man reveals his character even more clearly by the crime he elects to commit than by the wife he chooses out of all the women in the world . He could not , he would not , ' anyway he did not , commit other crimes ; he chose one or more in a narrow range . And the Atlanta survey begins to turn on the lights only when it breaks down its results into crime groups . BEFORE we go into these fascinating but difficult particulars , the crude over-all averages established for the 500 inmates were : age , 35.9 ; current sentence , 8.5 years ; schooling , to the seventh grade ; years spent in prison , 8.2 ; number of arrests , 11 ; previous sentences served , 2 ; age at first arrest , 18 ; average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judging them as potential equals : a dismal crew , already architects of dismal lives . The totality grows more humanly recognizable when it is divided into temperamental crimes given as 25 per cent car theft ( apparently an average and undistinguished crime ) , 14 per cent narcotics , nearly 14 per cent forgery , nearly 10 per cent armed robbery , 6 per'cent larceny and liquor crimes and 4.6 per cent murder . Any other groups mentioned here were down around 2 per cent . I take it that when one of these groups gives a group answer that is conspicuously off the norm for all the groups , we have something worth noticing . Unless it can be - explained away by racial or social factors or the peculiar operations of the law , it is a clue . On the I.Q.s , the stupidest were the murderers at 88 per cent , followed by the liquor violators . The murderers were also the oldest - ( in their forties ) , had the least schooling and were among the best church-goers . They were joined by the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooling and good church records in prison . The brightest were the ' larcenists ( 112.5 I.Q. ) , the Mann Act violators , the narcotics ' cases , the forgers and the armed robbers . But all these had a little less schooling than the fairly stupid morals ' cases . The best church-goers as a group were the narcotics and morals cases . On the test of marriage , another dimension is given to the crime groups . The largest perCentage of single men lay among the young and unintelligent kidnapers and the more intelligent sex criminals . The highest score in maintaining marriages went to the intelligent armed robbers with 66 per cent , followed by the narcotics cases . In numbers divorced , the only startling figure is for mail-fraud cases who are zero single , zero married and 100 per cent divorced . EVEN IN a secret , inviolable poll like this , one must be awed by the question , " Do you plan to continue in crime ? " But the answers seem to me even more awesome : Yes , 11.3 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 17 per cent ; No ( figure " maybe " ) , 71.7 per cent . Figure some jokers both ways : the re-adventurers into crime must come to at least 30 per cent , probably nearer 50 per cent . The highest Yes figures were for the kidnapers , morals cases and forgers ; and a lot of kidnapers and burglars did n't know . That small but remarkable mail-fraud group was alone in voting 100 per cent No . It should now be added that this group reached the senior year of high school . The contrasting interest - in more crime by the kidnapers and murderers becomes less ominous when one notices that their averag6 sentences run for 59 and 35 years ; indeed , the December 26 , 1959 very frivolity of their interest may have inspired it . - " Is this your last time in prison ? " ought to bring answers corresponding inversely to those above . And so we get a happy chorus of 100 per cent Yes from the morals cases who had already avowed a considerable intention of continuing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem never to learn . However , the mail-fraud cases also voted 100 per cent Yes ; and these I seem to believe , ' since this answer corresponds with their 100 per cent No to the pre-.ceding question . The murderers and Mann Act violators thought it a weary 37 per cent possible that they would be back in prison , with , Do n't know ; and this answer has some logical relation to their criminal intentions . . , , , BY NOW we can guess how they will all react to the prison situation . As to whether prison supervision was an asset , only he mail-fraud cases and the armed robbers gave a majority Yes . A ringing No was returned by the Mann Act violators ( 75 per cent ) and the murderers ( 71 per cent ) . Rephrasing the question to " Are officials - here to help you ? " did not change the responses much . The larcenists , narcotics cases , mail-fraud cases and armed robbers are not unwilling to say Yes . The kidnapers , Mann Act violators and murderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try again : " Do you find it difficult to adjust to prison life ? " Here the kidnapers and the sex criminals are in agreement on the difficulty , but the murderers this time are fairly calm about it , at only 37 not quite as calm at 25 per cent . When we nag again on what is the prisoner 's present attitude , the " hopefuls " are fewest among the long-term murderers ( 12 per cent ) and kidnapers ( 16 per cent ) . The latter , with the longer terms , are younger and thus slightly more hopeful . The highest percentage of " hopefuls " is to be found of course with those feckless idiots , the morals cases ( 66 per cent ) . At the next sober , reasonable level come the mail frauds , narcotics and armed robbers , as wead nearly expected . w Of course , the words " hopeful , " " indifferent , " " resigned , " etc. , mean very different things to different individuals in this situation . A few incidental sidelights on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaping custody , the high score ' belonged to the burglars ( 80 per cent ) followed by the larcenists ( 57 per cent ) ; the least enterprising in this respect were the mail-fraud cases ( zero ) and the narcotics offenders ( 2.7 per- cent ) . The older men naturally feel most strongly that first offenders should be segregated , and these are the liquor violators , murderers , mail-fraud and narcotics cases . The general average of the inmates who had had trades ran around only 60 per cent , but the morals cases were at 83 per cent and the mail-fraud cases at 75 per cent . It is saddening to notice that the often estimable armed robbers here drop to only 43 per cent , and are also the lowest in learning a trade in prison ( 23 per cent ) . Perhaps these people are playing a game with the authorities , invisible to me , or perhaps they would be genuinely ashamed of any trade other than armed robbery . A less unexpected sadness comes with the fact that the young kidnapers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trade before prison . But again it may be asked : when does a man consider that he has a 487 " trade " ? . What are the criteria of a " trade " and of " having " it ? Can the writer of these lines be said to " have " a " trade " ? ONE MUST have begun to descry in the foregoing bare statistics the cloudy emerging outlines of some half-seen types of people , self-revealed almost unconsciously . One may be skeptical , but I believe much of this revelation is valid , for a reason inherent in data generally . These data were not taken to prove our point , but to prove something else , almost the opposite ; that is , that there is a single , generalized prisoner who is a pretty nice fellow . This inquiry thus approaches the research , as it were , by the back window . The useful conclusion is that treatment of prisoners might profitably vary with the crime , throughout society 's relations with them . Taken in that way , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made about criminals has , from this point of view , the ring of nonsense . For example , James V. Bennett , chief of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and one of this country 's leading penologists , describes " the more than 100,000 defeated , embittered , twisted , queer , handicapped and seriously neurotic individuals who pass annually through the gates of our prisons . " This statement has some status as poetry and accomplishes the chief purpose of most writing on the subject : to prove that the man 's heart is in the right place . But , as we have seen , each of Mr , Bennett 's adjectives may apply to a majority of one group and not to another , Or all the adjectives may be said to apply to nearly everybody alive , It is unnatural to house masses of men within walls , as the 5,200 at San Quentin , the 4,600 at Ohio State ( the penitentiary ) , the 4,650 at Joliet , The result will certainly appear noisome , but to beautify the joint will prove little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , as some suggest and as the Latin Arnericans , Russians and some Asiatics do , would have very different effects on different groups of convicts . It would certainly not help the 100 per cent-divorced mail-fraud cases , or the unmarried morals cases , and might incite them to riot . The 500 prisoners at Atlanta are equally unhelpful when they try to reveal themselves as a totality . Thus majorities in the Atlanta poll say they had a happy home life , an average family background , were , unjustly sentenced , usually tell the truth , write their . families , do n't see enough of their families , do not especially miss family life or sex , and so on . Anybody from President Eisenhower to Frank Sinatra might have returned these answers ; they may describe everybody or nobody . The truth is that a given period of a society creates its special crimes , and summons out its special types of criminals . We no longer have the terrible crimes of lese majesty and religious heresy , for which people were torn apart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been rotated into place . The harsh kidnaping laws were passed against hardened , middle-aged criminals - and have produced the young , stupid , unmarried , churchgoing type . Car theft , a crime encouraged by all Detroit 's glamorous and seductive advertising , is too widely attractive to produce any single type , so , far ' as I can see . It is also among the least severely punished crimes , But , after an act has been made a crime , it takes a given sort of personality , , experience and mood to commit it . And this person in a different kind or period of society could easily have lived a blameless life . It does no good to say that society is positively to blame for the criminal and the crime ; society is what it must be . SOCIETY 'S problem is first to catch the criminal , and then , what to do with him . In some societies the answer is to kill him at once , which ends the individual problem cheaply . The second answer is to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , The third is to give him a graduated punishment by confinement and then ? with a pious prayer , turn him loose , The fourth is to try to understand him and somehow undo in a Jew years the self-destructive patterns which ate , , however , the , criminal 's most cherished private universe ; This-last i$ current doctrine , but not practice . One might say that if all veteran convicts were redeemed and rehabilitated , the contribution to society in , a positive sense would be so negligible as to be unnoticeable. , A William Sydney Porter does sometimes land in prison , but it is a long time between 0 . Henrys . Still , I noticed that some of the writing in the Atlanta Penitentiary survey was quite creditable , definitely above average high school level . But I. think it is more important to look at the free boys from fifteen through seventeen now on the streets , among whom the hardened criminals will be chosen almost by accident or lot ; If we can get those boys past a year or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime and a pride in crime , they will be real men at twenty-one . The human material here is so salvageable , so valuable , so close to salvation , that the hearts of the officials dealing with juvenile delinquents must be perpetually breaking .
