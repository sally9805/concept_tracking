The world witnessed the most dramatic proof yet of a remarkable change in U.S. policy in Korea . The U.S. now seemed prepared to fight a MacArthur war , instead of the cautious war once advocated by Dean Acheson and George Marshall . <P> Douglas MacArthur , in his messages to the enemy , never matched the harshness of the words General Matthew Ridgway used last week . Calling Communist charges that U.N . forces had violated the neutrality of Kaesong " malicious falsehoods , " Ridgway poured towering scorn on the Communists in a historic verbal nose-twisting . More significant than words were Ridgway 's deeds : at week 's end , through the hot skies of Korea roared a force of B293 to plaster the once-untouchable North Korean port of Rashin " ( see WAR IN ASIA ) . Throughout the period of his command , MacArthur urged the bombing of Rashin . On Aug. 12 , 1950 he did bomb it , but further attacks on Rashin were forbidden by Washington . " It was a question of the risk involved , " Secretary Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet frontier . " <P> Rashin is no farther from the Russian border than it was a year ago . There is still the danger that the Russians will come in . But now Washington applauds the act that it formerly condemned . <P> Reason : The MacArthur firing and the MacArthur hearings have moved Washington toward a more decisive policy . The Rashin raid could be interpreted by the stalling Chinese only as a taste of Mac-Arthur policy-a pointed hint that if the truce talks fail , the U.S. will no longer play by the old confining ground rules .
