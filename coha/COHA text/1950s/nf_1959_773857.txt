txt CALL THE DOCTOR 6o Let them , but under their superiors , kill , When Doctors first have signed the bloody bill . ' Born in bitterness , the dispensaries were not a great success and were closed down after a few years ; but similar institutions multiplied under other auspices later in the eighteenth century . To Dr Richard Mead has been given credit for trying to narrow the breach between physicians and apothecaries after the dispensary battle . Along with Dr Radcliffe ( whose apothecary Dandridge is said to have left ? 6o,000 ) he popularised the practice of consulting apothecaries at his coffee-house . After listening to a recital of patients ' symptoms , he would write out a prescription and charge half the usual guinea fee . Mead would have been shocked to hear the harsh things that were said about this second-hand diagnosis by physicians of a later day . It was richesse oblige on his part ; after all , he was a busy man . No doubt patients were gratified to , be able to obtain his advice , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farce when practised by physicians of lesser attainments than Mead and Radcliffe ; that is , by idle fellows from the universities , ignorant of the materia medica , whose vanity was gratified by keeping a servile apothecary waiting while they conversed with poets and wits . The apothecaries won two notable successes against the physicians in the courts . Although they had long claimed the right to prescribe and treat without reference to a physician , their members had been frequently prosecuted by the Royal College for doing so . In 1703 William Rose , an apothecary , was convicted of this offence . He appealed to the Lords , who reversed the decision of the lower court , making it clear that they did so in the public interest . In its wider sense , the case of the Royal College was untenable , for if the apothecaries had not taken it upon themselves to prescribe and treat , the sick poor in the country at large would have lacked almost all medical attention . Nevertheless , the Royal College had some sharp comments to make on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out , had treated a butcher called John Seal for 12 months , charging him nearly ? 50 , and had done him no good , whereas when he attended the dispensary of the Royal College he had been cured in six weeks for less than 4os. * // The other victory by the apothecaries over the College was secured when one of their number won damages against a group of eminent physicians for illegal seizure of his wares . After this the censers of the College displayed a great deal more caution in exercising their ancient privilege of inspection . One of the apothecary 's undoubted faults was a tendency towards high-pressure salesmanship . His delight was to find a wealthy patient willing and eager to try out new medicines . The patient would then be progressively debauched until his apothecary 's bill exceeded that of his tailor and his grocer . At his worst , an apothecary could be as rapacious as the most unregenerate of moneylenders . In Bernard Mandeville 's Treatise of the Hypochondria ( 1711 ) is a passage describing how an apothecary , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person of quality : There happened to be nobody at home but children and servants who from the highest to the lowest were all in perfect health ; if here he came for business ( you 'll say ) he was disappointed ; but you are mistaken ; the courteous gentleman with an engaging familiarity accosts every servant in the house and puts off a purge to the cook , a vomit to the butcher , a box of pills to one of the footmen and a pot of lucatellus balm to old Nurse . The children absolutely refused to take any physic . . . at last he coaxes the little master into the use of a charming dentifrice and a sweet scented collyriuln to rinse his mouth with after it . . . to pretty miss he 'll send a lotion for her hair and a paste for her hands . . . with a beauty wash for their maid that assisted in the pursuit of them . . . The children are pleased , the servants commend him , my lady is obliged to him . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took of her family in her absence . ' Dr Thomas Dover , that proponent of quicksilver , says in his Ancient Physician 's Legacy ( 1732 ) : I never affronted an apothecary , unless ordering too little physic , and curing a patient too soon , is in their way of thinking , an unpardonable crime . I must confess I could never bring an apothecary 's bill to three pounds , in a fever ; whereas I have known some of their bills , in this disease , amount to forty , fifty and sixty pounds . If I ca n't cure with less charges , I ca n't forbear saying that I have the same opinion of their integrity as I have of their understanding . ' Yet , with all his faults , the apothecary could not be held back . He had prised open the back door of medicine and the law had given him permission to enter and make himself at home . The Society of Apothecaries pursued its advantage by securing the // passing of Acts of Parliament which enabled it not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already the middle classes and the higher tradesmen were beginning to apprentice their sons to apothecaries and to pay good money for the privilege . Because there was obviously a good living to be gained as an apothecary , numbers of needy persons set themselves up as such without going to the fatigue of obtaining a diploma from the Society of Apothecaries . They served for brief periods as assis-tants or apprentices to licensed apothecaries and surgeons and then felt themselves qualified to embark on all-round practice on their own . Though they were , strictly speaking , quacks , many of them became highly respected members of the community . They were , in fact , the forerunners of the general practitioner of the nineteenth century . Professionally , the apothecary ? whether he flourished a dip-loma or called himself surgeon-apothecary ? still ranked below the physician and the surgeon . Socially , he still ranked below the parson and the lawyer . But he was the man who sat up with the seriously ill patient while physician , lawyer and parson slept ? and the public did not forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eighteenth century was his goldheaded cane . It was a wand of office which helped to impress the patient . At the same time it sometimes had a utilitarian function , for it contained in its head aromatic material designed to offset the foul vapours of sick rooms and hospital wards . In their candid moments , the priesthood of the gold-headed cane were ready to admit that even after 2,000 years of medicine t here was still not one certain cure for any disease . The doctor 's role was very nearly as defined by a character in Fielding 's Tom Jones : Nature should be left to do her own work , while the physician stands by , as it were , to clap her on the back and encourage her when she cloth well . ' Lady Mary Wortley Montagu , whose views on physicians were waspish , complained that money once given to monks for the health of the soul was now thrown to doctors for the health of the body , and generally with as little prospect of success . ' Voltaire 's considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine of which he knew nothing into a body of which he knew less . Yet , through the eighteenth century , the way was slowly prepared for the tremendous advances of the nineteenth . In hospitals and elsewhere , the work of Sydenham in observing and elsassifying diseases was continued . Isolation and quarantine began to be accepted as essential in the treatment of fever . Sir John Pringle showed that there was no valid reason why British hattalions should be wiped out regularly by fever and pestilence , and the Admiralty came to recognise that the entire ship 's complement need not necessarily be sacrificed to scurvy on a long voyage . The notion that every other babe must die was challenged . So was the tradition that childbirth was below a doctor 's notice . 63 // Inoculation against smallpox , thanks in no small measure to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu , made headway , to be succeeded , in the closing stages of the century , by vaccination . Even the horrors of mad-houses , both public and private , began to be cleared up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Victoria 's reign . George III described the strait-waistcoat as the best friend he ever had . What the medical profession chiefly needed was a proper system of education and training . The Royal College of Physicians , sulking at its defeat by the apothecaries , did not regard this as its responsibility ; its charter merely said that it should hold examinations . Would-be physicians who had private means idled through the academic futilities of Oxford and Cambridge or set off to medical schools on the Continent . Aspirants of modest means were left to apprentice themselves to such practitioners as would accept them , picking up the virtues , prejudices and faults of busy men for whom they performed much ill-requited drudgery . They might in due course walk the wards of a hospital , and take the examinations of the Apothecaries and the Surgeons , or even go on to a university ; but many went into practice as soon as this apprenticeship was over . It was left to the Scots to found the first medical school in Britain . Dr Alexander Monro modelled his establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leyden , and was soon attracting students who would otherwise have gone to that city . Scots doctors began to drift south , ready to snatch at any medical post from naval surgeon 's mate upwards . They were viewed with disapproval by the Royal College and not without hauteur at Surgeons ' Hall . Those who had studied under Dr Monro might know their science , but there were others flourishing diplomas which they had obtained by irregular means , or after inadequate study , and even in absentia . The universities of Aberdeen and St Andrews , in particular , were prone to give diplomas to those who had undergone no examination , but who had been able to persuade a couple of not very eminent physicians to certify them fit for practice . These universities took no particular pride in the game , but funds were low and professors had to live . Scots degrees could even be obtained from brokers in London . The prestige of the physicians was saved , to some extent , by the founding , in the early half of the century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these included the Westminster , Guy 's , St George 's , the London and the Middlesex . Most were built by wealthy philanthropists ( Thomas Guy 's fortune was wade during the South Sea Bubble ) ; others were founded by physicians themselves . These great institutions could not be left for apothecaries to seize , and the elect of the Royal College were quick to compete , and intrigue , for posts on their staffs . The physicians now had what they had so long lacked , save at the venerable institutions of St Bartholomew 's and St Thomas 's : an unending pageant of fevers and assorted diseases , other than gout , paraded daily for their personal study . In the long illsmelling wards the more conscientious physicians risked their lives along with their reputations , receiving little if any financial reward . Others , to whom a hospital appointment was primarily a source of social prestige , sniffed disdainfully at the pageant of sores and left the wards as soon as they decently could . The patients were made suitably aware of the privilege conferred on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not gravely ill would be expected to wait on the visitor in his consulting room . The hospital background lent dignity to a man who was already an impressive figure in his wig , scarlet satin , buckled shoes and muff ( to keep the hands sensitive , as well as warm ) , and whose least Hippocratic appendage was a sword . Such a figure could not be expected to tour the hospital without a supporting cast of minor characters and a welcoming committee in each ward . When he stopped at the bedside of an awed patient he could afford to be gravely affable and solicitous . A few physicians abused their position , however , one of them being the poet Mark Akenside , whose stanzas were more felicitous than his manners ( he is said to have changed his name from Akinside on the ground that , for a doctor , it lent itself too readily to jests ) . Evidently this one-time butcher 's son had adopted Dr Radcliffe 's advice to treat mankind ill , ' and he shared Radcliffe 's testy impatience with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The supercilious Akenside , with his pale strumous countenance ' framed in a full-bottomed wig , and with a long sword clanking , would order the hospital servants to precede him with brooms to clear the way and to prevent the patients approaching too closely ; an edifying spectacle in an institution bearing the name of Christ 's Hospital . At St Thomas 's the sick poor cowered at his approach . If they did not give a // clear , direct answer to his questions they were liable to be sum-marily discharged . He could not bear to see anyone smile in the presence of an invalid , ' said a contemporary . Dr J. C. Lettsom , in his younger days , was inexpressibly shocked ' when a patient who was unable to swallow his medicine was ordered by Akenside to be removed forthwith ? He shall not die in my hospital . ' The patient , as it happened , was impertinent enough to die as he was being wheeled away . Once a Governor of St Thomas 's said to the physician who spoke of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Charity . ' * Akenside died , unrepentant , in the bed in which Milton died . In St Bartholomew 's Hospital it had been the custom in the previous century to allow students to walk the wards , and this facility was extended to the new voluntary hospitals . As will be seen , it was a privilege which was sometimes badly abused . The average patient looked no more kindly on a flock of inquisitive students than does the patient of today . The poet Martial had summed up the sufferer 's reaction centuries before : I send for Symmachus to ease my pain . A hundred pupils follow in his train , And feel me with their frigid hands . I vow I had no fever but I have one now . ' Working up a successful practice called for much enterprise and impudence . Not every physician was as fortunate as Dr William Battie , who had hardly set up at Uxbridge before Dr Godolphin , Provost of Eton , sent his coach-and-four for him . The Provost explained : You need not trouble to prescribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit in the neighbourhood . ' t Advertising had to be done by oblique methods . Thus , gentle-men 's chariots would be stopped in the street by anxious-seeming servants enquiring whether Dr So-and-So was aboard ; the occupants would be well aware that this was merely Dr So-and-So 's way of spreading his name . In coffee-houses the question , Is Dr Such-and-Such here ? ' was liable to be received with derision . Tobias Smollett , who was unsuccessful in his attempts to set himself up as a physician in London and Bath , drenches the proCALL // fession with the juice of sour grapes in The Adventures of Count Fathom . In his view , a carriage was the first essential of an aspiring doctor , for a walking physician was considered as an obscure pedlar , trudging from street to street with his pack of knowledge on his shoulders and selling his remnants of advice by retail . ' There were patients who were ready to judge a walking doctor as summarily as did that gouty old gentleman mentioned in The Spectator : Go , send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he pretends he would long before now have been in his coach-and-six . ' Yet there were physicians who could put up a brave show even on foot . Dr John Huxham , a butcher 's son with a Leyden degree , who was not above suspicion of having himself called from dissenting conventicles on fictitious errands , used to walk in a scarlet coat with his gold-headed cane , followed by a footman a pace or two in rear carrying his gloves . A fruitful cause of traffic accidents in London , says Smollett , was to be found in the coaches of physicians , surgeons and apothecaries all driving in spirited fashion nowhere in particular . So barefaced was the aimless parading of the medical profession that even the apprentices at the shop doors used to ridicule it . Count Fathom , not wishing to incur this mockery , took the trouble to study a map of London . Then he used to alight at the end of long narrow thoroughfares and paved courts , when the chariot was ordered to wait till his return ; and walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regain his carriage by another passage and resume his seat with an air of vast importance . ' Sometimes he beguiled his peregrination by stopping to read a quack 's advertisement , to swallow a dram or to use a urinal . Continues Smollett : The other means used to force a trade , such as ordering himself to be called in church , alarming the neighbourhood with knocking at his door in the night , receiving sudden messages in places of resort and inserting his cures by way of news in the daily papers had been . . . injudiciously hackneyed by every desperate skuller in physic ... ' The Count , however , hoped to erect a hospital , lock or infirmary , by the voluntary subscription of his friends , which had succeeded to a miracle with many of the profession , who had raised themselves into notice upon the carcasses of the poor . Yet even this branch was already over-stocked , in so much that almost every street was furnished with one of these charitable receptacles , // which , instead of diminishing the taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be idle and dissolute , by opening an asylum to them and their families .. The main thing , says Smollett , was to become the talk of the town , even if the talk was about one 's own malpractice . Some members of the Faculty had been heard to complain that they had never had the good fortune to be publicly accused of homicide . ' It is noteworthy that the practices which Count Fathom dis missed as too hackneyed were freely employed by Dickens ' Bob Sawyer . If Smollett is any guide , the medical profession , like the theatrical profession today , put much value in word-of-mouth recommendation . A lady felt ill . Her maid recommended a nurse . The nurse in turn recommended an apothecary . The apothecary recommended a physician . The physician , deciding that the patient needed bleeding , brought along a surgeon . They always appear in a string , like a flock of wild geese , and each confederacy maintains a correspondence with one particular undertaker . ' Another literary man who failed to establish himself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , such as it was , as an apothecary 's assistant . Later , friends helped o set him up as a physician in a humble way at Bankside , South wark . One of his contemporaries described him as conventionally attired ' in tarnished green and gold , but with a shirt and neck-cloth which appeared to have been worn for at least a fortnight . ' I Es velvet coat had an ill-sewn patch on the left breast and he used to hold his hat over it when visiting a sick-bed . This man nerism soon became known and caused mirth among his clientele . On his second attempt to work up a practice , Goldsmith spared no expense . He had a scarlet roquelare buttoned to the chin , ' wig , cane , sword and manservant . His practice seems to have ended after a brawl with an apothecary at the bedside of a Mrs Sidebotham . Eventually the two practitioners decided to ask the patient whose advice she would prefer and she chose that of the apothecary . Probably she was wise. * A notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor and companion to Dr Samuel Johnson . His professional qualifications are not clear . According to Boswell , Lever 's walk was from Houndsditch to Marylebone , all his clients being poor // people . Such was Johnson 's predilection for him , and fanciful estimation of his moderate abilities , that I have heard him say he should not be satisfied , though attended by all the College of Physicians , unless he had Mr Levet with him . ' It was customary for Levet , who had a room in the Doctor 's house , to wait upon Johnson every morning , through the whole course of his late and tedious breakfast . ' Unkindly , the Bishop of Dromore used to say that Levet breakfasted on a roll which Johnson , after tearing out the best part , tossed to him . Some of Levet 's patients were in the habit of paying their indebtedness with a glass of spirit . According to Johnson , he would swallow what he did not like , nay what he knew would injure him , rather than go home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' If Dr Johnson tossed his medical attendant a half-eaten roll for breakfast , he made amends with a dignified epitaph . The verses on Levet include : Well try 'd through many a varying year See Levet to the grave descend ; Officious , innocent , sincere , Of every friendless name the friend . Yet still he fills affection 's eye , Obscurely wise , and coarsely kind ; Nor , letter 'd arrogance , deny Thy praise to merit unrefined . When fainting Nature called for aid , And hovering Death prepared the blow , His vigorous remedy display 'd The power of art without the show . No summons mock 'd by chill delay , No petty gains disdained by pride , The modest wants of every day The toil of every day supply 'd . His virtues walk 'd their narrow round , Nor made a pause , nor left a void ; And sure the Eternal Master found His single talent well employed . Dr Johnson , says Boswell , had in general a peculiar pleasure in the company of physicians . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by Dr Radcliffe appeared to have done the profession little good . It is in vain to send our travelling physicians to France and Italy and Germany , for all that is known there is known here ; I 'd send them out of Christendom ; I 'd send them among barbarous nations . ' In this , Dr Johnson was echoing the view of the cantankerous Dr Thomas Dover , who wrote in The Ancient Physician 's Legacy that more benefit would be derived from Radcliffe 's grants if candidates first studied physic for ten years , by which time their observations would be of some use to them . Then , instead of travelling in polite lands , they should go to the most intemperate climates , where all acute diseases are the most violent . ' Dr Dover added : If travel be necessary to make an accomplished physician I am very sure that I have travelled more than all the physicians in Great Britain put together . ' It was he who discovered Alex ander Selkirk ( Robinson Crusoe ' ) on Juan Fernandez island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their forbears , physicians still gave themselves weighty airs . Any deviation from the pattern was sufficiently unusual to call for remark . The biographer of Bishop Newton says of Sir John Eliot that he had nothing of the formality and stiffness of other physicians , he made no mystery of his art , and communicated his prescriptions and explained what they were , for what purpose he gave them and what effects he designed should follow them ; and was a lively friend and companion as well as an excellent good physician . ' * This may have been the Sir John Eliot who sailed as a surgeon in a privateer and won enough prize money to enable him to study for his doctor 's degree . A malaise peculiar to the Age of Reason was hypochondria . It was not a disease to which a modern name can be given , for it covered everything from constipation to manic depression , from dyspepsia to religious doubt . Mostly , it attacked the seden tary and those who had too much time to think ; the busy and the abstemious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story of a don whom inactive life had brought to such a state of morbid gloom that , convinced he was dying , he ordered the // passing bell to be tolled from a near-by church . The bells were rung so atrociously that , in disgust , the sufferer climbed out of bed , rushed over to the church and showed the sexton how the job should be done . Through this unaccustomed exercise he wrought himself into a muck sweat , ' then returned home to expire content . His strenuous outing , as it turned out , was the means of restoring him to life and health. * James Boswell , a great hypochondria fancier , beguiled his Grand Tour by exchanging symptoms with fellow sufferers and collecting anecdotes of irrational , suicidal and apathetic be haviour to which victims of the malady were subject ( a Bruns-wicker said he would not stir two feet to get ? 2,000 ) . Like venereal disease , hypochondria became known on the Continent as the English malady . It is probable that a good many hypo chondriacs were anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status as intellectuals made manifest . The smart thing to take for the complaint was opium , which doctors seem to have prescribed all too freely . Today the disease has been broken down into its many constituent ailments , and a hypochondriac is merely a gloomy fellow excessively concerned with the state of his health . No one has given a better description of the hypochondriac state than the advertiser in The Spectator whose Famous Drops ' were capable of comforting the brain and nerves , composing the hurried thoughts , and introducing bright lively ideas and pleasant briskness , instead of dismal apprehension and dark incumbrance of the soul , setting the intellectuals at liberty to act with courage , serenity and steady cheerfulness , and causing a visible diffusive joy to reign in the room of uneasy doubts , fears , etc . ' Un doubtedly there were forms of hypochondria which could be cured by powerful drops at 3S. 6d. a bottle , but equally there were sufferers who , like Lady Macbeth , stood more in need of the divine than of the physician . Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a dialogue in which a physician propounds what are presumably the author 's own views . The principal causes of hypochondria , it appears , are the immoderate exercise of the brain and excess of venery ' ( which includes marital venery ) . It can also be induced by immoderate grief , cares , troubles and disappointments . ' Much hypochondria can be dispersed by fresh air and exercise , // in Mandeville 's view . His physician prescribes a rugged regimen for a young unmarried woman : Every morning as soon as she rises ( which I would have her do by six ) let her be swung for half-an-hour , then eat her breakfast and get on horseback for at least two hours , either galloping or trotting , as much as her strength will permit her . Immediately after this let her be undrest , and by some nurse or other chafed or dry-rubbed for a considerable time till her skin looks red and her flesh glows all over ; let her begin to repeat the same exercise about three in the afternoon and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . ' Elaborating on the methods of swinging , the physician says that a flying horse makes a very agreeable motion ; but if she be apt to be giddy she may be swung in a chair , ' or even in a rope tied to a beam . He defends horse riding on the grounds that there is nothing like the repeated succussations of a horse ' to dispel the morbific remainders in the intestines . ' The physician is then asked : But might not marriage be as effectual as all this exercise ? ' He replies : Yes , but I never prescribe an uncertain remedy . ' How many young women were subjected to the Mandeville treatment we do not know . Swinging was a fashionable pastime , but it was regarded more as a form of amorous dalliance than a system of therapy . One of the best doctors for hypochondria was Dr George Cheyne , a man weighing 32 stone who scarcely looked like an apostle of the simple life , which in fact he was . Cheyne had lived a riotous tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his health broke down and he , too , suffered from dark incumbrance of the soul . He recovered , thanks to a judicious course of Bath water and plenty of milk and vegetables . Cheync had many eminent patients whom he steered from the paths of surfeit by the same diet , though without inflating their figures to the same degree as his own . The wealthier classes , surveying each other 's bellies , could hardly fail to be aware that they ate and drank too much . But why ( they reasoned ) should they limit their pleasures when it was the physician 's function to keep them in condition ? Why should a gentleman go to the fatigue of exercise , or travel at huge inconvenience to a primitive Highland spa for a diet of goats ' whey , when the physician could achieve the same results by a system of // bleeding and purging , followed by cordials , volatiles , bracers and strengtheners ? After all , what was the doctor for ? Dryden summed it up : The first physicians by debauch were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Addison assured readers of The Spectator that blister ing , cupping and bleeding were of use only to the idle and the intemperate , that the apothecary was perpetually employed in counter-mining the cook and the vintner . ' Most physicians recog nised these truths . A few , like Cheyne , were bold or honest enough to practise their beliefs and to recommend a simple life when it would have been more lucrative to send a medicine with 50 ingredients to punish a sauce with roo . But there remained all too many doctors who were content to order what the patient expected them to order , rather than insult him , and lose him , by advising him to do some active work . When the ordinary routine of bleeding and purging failed , the patient was packed off , grumbling , to a spa , either at home or abroad . Steadily , the number of health resorts was multiplying . The prosperity of Bath , Epsom , Tunbridge and Moffat was an incitement to ambitious doctors to discover and exploit new heal ing springs . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus rendering long pilgrimages unnecessary . More audacious doctors even began to discover virtues in sea-bathing . The transformation of Brighton from a fishing village to a fashionable resort began in the 1750S when a Dr Russell of Lewes proclaimed the benefits he had derived from bathing there ( his patients were urged to swallow as much sea water as they could ) . Almost every seaside resort can point to a doctor who has helped to put it on the map ; Filey , if it wishes , can boast of being publicised by Dr Edward Pritchard , the poisoner . Some of the excesses of that hydropathy which became all the rage in Victorian England were already to be noted in the reign of George III . Horace Walpole wrote to the Rev. William Cole in 1775 : Dr Heberden ( as every physician , to make himself talked of , will set up some new hypothesis ) pretends that a damp house , and even damp sheets , which have ever been reckoned fatal , are wholesome ; to prove his faith he went into his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malvern they certainly put patients into sheets just dipped in the spring .. Philip Thicknesse , an ex-apothecary 's **32;715;TOOLONG , had a more attractive idea . In The Valetudinarian 's Bath Guide ( 178o ) he recommends that the best way to live long is by partaking of the breath of young virgins , or what is perhaps the same thing , by partaking of the breath of youthful persons . ' He elaborates thus : Everybody has experienced the sweetness of the breath of cows and for that reason it is esteemed wholesome , and as the fragrancy of young people 's breath , who are brought up under proper regimen , falls little short of that of cows , it is natural to suppose that it is productive of some virtue . The brisk and lively motion in the blood of young people is the cause of their health , vigour and growth ; and I see no reason to doubt but that the re-respiring their breath may rouse the sluggish circulation of men advanced in years . ' Schoolmasters , says Thicknesse , have a natural advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society of young women nor young company till he is unable to keep any . ' Thicknesse had his lucid moments , however . He scoffed with some justification at the ways of overfed patients who went to Bath , drank three pints of the water and followed up by a large meal of Sally Lunns or hot spongy rolls . One of the more unusual health establishments , at the century 's end , was the Pneumatic Institute for Relieving Diseases by Medical Airs , founded at Clifton , near Bristol , by Dr Thomas 13eddoes , for whom mere fresh air was not fresh enough . It contained an expensive apparatus , built by James Watt , for the production of factitious airs , ' the inhalation of which , it was hoped , would cure a variety of diseases . It was here , in 1799 , that young Humphry Davy , who had been engaged as superintendent , began his experiments with nitrous oxide . Cautiously inhaling it , he experienced the most vivid sensation of pleasure accompanied by a rapid succession of highly excited ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to a friend : Oh , Tom , such a gas has Davy discovered , the gaseous oxide ! Oh Tom ! I have had some ; it made me laugh and tingle in every toe and fingertip . Davy has actually invented a new pleasure for which language has no name . Oh Tom , I am going for more this evening ; it makes one strong and so happy ! so // gloriously happy ! ' * It was not long before Samuel Taylor Coleridge also came along for a sniff . Dr Beddoes himself hardly needed to inhale nitrous oxide in order to induce a rapid succession of highly excited ideas . ' He had suffered from them all his life . The new laughing gas seemed to him well worth adding to the range of vapours and gases already on tap at the establishment . Unfortunately it was adminis tered too freely to a highly hysterical female patient , whom the doctor had to hustle into his own home to treat . Inhalation of gases had been claimed as a remedy for scrofula , melancholia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of patients treated by Watt 's least successful engine gradually decreased and all interest in pneumatic medicine died with its only begetter . Nitrous oxide , however , had a modest future as an anaesthetic ? and as a cheap intoxicant for medical students of the next generation . In one of his many proposals for lightening the lot of the human race Dr Beddoes was well ahead of his time . His common-place book contains a note on what he regarded as the ill-effects of washday on women . He asks : Can no good genius invent a machine by which opulent neighbours , attentive to their hard-fated fellow creatures , may be able to relieve some of them from this destructive drudgery ? ' Wealthy patients were heard to grumble much at the fashion whereby one physician called in another , and the second a third . The cantankerous Duchess of Marlborough was firmly of the view that one reliable doctor was of more value than a multitude . If 20 were called in , they would all defer to the doctor who was most fashionable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being called in by his patients . It was popularly supposed that the junior doctor , who , traditionally , gave his opinion first , was bound to defer to his seniors if their opinions clashed ; but accord ing to the Royal College of Physicians the rule was if there are only two physicians either the junior must submit to the senior or they must call in a third to determine the matter . ' - Leading physicians were never so highly paid as during this century . In 1739 that stormy petrel , William Pulteney , later Earl // of Bath , lay prostrated by a fever at Lord Chetwynd 's house at Ingestre , Staffordshire . The illness cost him 750 guineas . Accord ing to one chronicler : Dr Hope , Dr Swynsen and other physicians from Stafford , Lichfield and Derby were called in and had about 250 guineas of his money . Dr Freind came down post from London with Mrs Pulteney and received 300 guineas for his journey . Dr Broxholme came from Oxford and received 200 guineas . ' These physicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their journey had been unnecessary . Like the doctors in Hilaire Belloc 's poem : They answered , as they took their fees , " There is no cure for this disease . " ' The patient had not abandoned hope , however . He kept asking for small beer , which eventually they gave him by way of humouring him . He perspired violently , slept and recovered. * Of the fashionable Sir Richard Jebb a sympathetic biographer has written that he was obliged by private practice to resign his hospital appointment . ' In the three years 1779 ? 81 his fees were said to have reached 20,000 guineas , and he might well have improved on this if he had bothered to humour some of his more tiresome patients . Although his manners left something to be desired , he could employ tact of a sort . When a nobleman paid him only three guineas instead of the expected five , Sir Richard dropped the coins , as if accidentally , on the floor . A servant picked them up and Sir Richard said , There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . ' The deficiency was then remedied . A rather less subtle technique was that employed , at a later date , by John Bell , the surgeon , when a rich Lanarkshire laird paid him a too-modest fee of ? i o . As he was being shown out , Bell said to the butler , You have had considerable trouble opening the door to me . Here is a trifle for you , ' and handed over the fee . In due course he received a draft for ? 150 . In 1768 Dr Thomas Dimsdale , of Hertford , earned a fee that was gratifying even by the standards of Louis XIV . He was a busy inoculator and author of a popular book on the subject which seems to have attracted the attention of the Empress Catherine of Russia . At her invitation he travelled to Russia to inoculate her and her son , the Grand Duke Paul , against small-pox . The Empress , well aware of how the populace would react // if the operation miscarried , secretly arranged for relays of horses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders , in order that Dr Dimsdale might make a safe escape. * Happily , these precautions were unnecessary . The doctor from Hertford received a ? ro , 000 fee , ? 2,000 for expenses , a life annuity of ? 500 a year and was made a baron of the Russian empire . In accordance with a custom of long standing , many physicians declined to accept fees from unbeneficed clergymen , though sometimes this indulgence was not accorded to clergymen of unorthodox beliefs . Dr Mead was sorely tried by a clerical patient , Robert Leake , who kept comparing his treatment with that which he had been receiving from Dr Cheyne . Mead administered this stately rebuke : Sir , I have never yet in the whole course of my practice taken or demanded the least fee from any clergyman , but since you have been pleased , contrary to what I have met with in any other gentle-man of your profession , to prescribe to me , rather than to follow my prescription , when you had committed the care of your recovery to my skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or will I hope think it unfair , if I demand ten guineas of you . ' t The patient paid up with some reluctance . Later , Mead returned six of the ten guineas . Clergy in high offices , or with private incomes , did not expect or receive free treatment . Dr John Fothergill , the Quaker , excusing himself for failing to charge a churchman who could well have paid , said : I had rather return the fee of a gentleman with whose rank I am not perfectly acquainted than run the risk of taking it from a man who ought perhaps to be the object of my bounty . ' In his Medical Ethics ( 1800 ) Thomas Percival said that not only clergymen but fellow doctors , apothecaries and their families should be treated free , though travelling fees might be charged if long distances had to be covered . Military and naval officers in poor circumstances were also proper objects of professional liberality . ' When a shabby , sickly Nelson expressed surprise at the modest fee of a physician at Bath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to follow what I consider my professional duty . Your illnesssirwas brought on by serving // your King and Country , and believe me , I love both too well to be able to receive any more . ' * Percival ruled that a physician degraded himself and his profession by accepting a small fee from a wealthy man . It was equally wrong for a wealthy physician to give advice gratis to the affluent , as this injured his fellow brethren . The office of physician , ' he wrote , can never be supported but as a lucrative one . ' Whether or not a physician charged his personal friends the standard fee was left to his discretion . The attitude of Sir Theodore Mayerne in the previous century had been unsentimental . One of his friends who called for a consultation afterwards placed two broad gold pieces on the table , confident that they would be refused and that he could therefore afford to seem generous . Sir Theodore , however , pocketed the coins , explaining to his startled friend , Sir , I made my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refused a fee I might be deemed non corn pos. ' - Perhaps it is not surprising that Sir Theodore left the prodigious sum , for his days , of ? 140,000 . VIII NOT ENOUGH ACCIDENTS ONE surgeon , William Cheselden , did more than any other man to bring much-needed prestige to his craft in the early eighteenth century . His reputation was built on the skill with which he operated for the stone , and that operation was based on one popularised by a French quack . Thanks largely to the gross eating habits of the time , dread of the stone constantly harassed the wealthier classes . The operation for this affliction ( to be performed , according to the Hippocratic Oath , only by specialists ) was one of exquisite pain and indignity , and the patient had little more than an even chance of survival . In Europe it had been the custom to celebrate the more heroic extractions in poems and paintings . Dutch artists liked nothing better than to depict a proud lithotomist holding up his trophy , beaming as might an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepys was relieved of an obstruction the size of a tennis ball , which he kept in a glass case specially made for the purpose . This boulder was an object of veneration at the annual feast in honour of its extraction and served to encourage other sufferers to undergo the grim operation . It was left to the notorious Frere Jacques , in 1697 , to demonstrate a new method of extraction . His performance was a sensational one to watch and resembled not so much an operation as an assassination . The friar had a dagger-pointed knife which he boldly drove into the hip of the sufferer , thrust home into the bladder , then enlarged his incision upwards and downwards until , after a few moments , he was able to extract the stone . The friar claimed that he had received heavenly guidance in his art , but heaven had endowed him with an indifferent knowledge of anatomy . He asked no reward for performing the operation , other than a few pence for food , or the repair of his shoes , and a certificate testifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation , in the words of John Bell , roused the learned lithotomists and physicians of Paris from their vigorous slumbers : * Here was a mere charlatan slashing his knife through an organ which , according to the learned , should only he dilated . From all parts of Europe came physicians and surgeons to watch the operation . The friar performed in hospitals and even on public stages , with sentries holding back the fasci nated mobs . For all his signed certificates , however , Frere Jacques could not conceal the fact that very often the patients who had signed them subsequently died . When their deaths occurred in hospital wards , he was not above blaming the nurses for deliber ately mangling the wounds . Probably his post-operational deaths were no more numerous than those of orthodox surgeons , but the friar had to face bitter persecution . If heaven lent him his skill , why did heaven let his patients die ? William Cheselden began performing his improved version of Frere Jacques ' operation in 1727 and soon worked himself up to such professional and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rich paid him a fee of 500 guineas for a feat of skill and audacity which , on occasion , he could complete in fewer than 6o seconds ; a feat which , nevertheless , caused him to blanch beforehand at the knowledge of the pain he was to inflict . In the three hospitals to which he was lithotomist , he per-formed the same operation free on the poor . Sometimes the public prints recorded the size of the stones he conjured from his more distinguished patients and the number of minutes and seconds he t c ok to do so . No one looked on this as an invasion of privacy . After all , gentlemen were deeply interested in these matters . Cheselden 's fame , however , did not rest wholly on this speciality . He stimulated that passion for anatomy which gripped all surgeons as the century advanced . Early in his career his enthusiasm involved him in a clash with the Barber-Surgeons Cornpany , who accused him of attracting away from them not only the bodies of felons , but large numbers of students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trouble . He was less successful in talking his way out of an uproar which arose when it was learned that he was preparing to perforate the ear-drum of a condemned criminal , in an attempt to discover the cause and cure of deafness . There was a recent precedent of sorts for experi ments of this kind in the trial of smallpox inoculations , in 1721 , // on six condemned criminals ? and then on six charity children . However , the car-drilling proposal had to be abandoned and the criminal lost his chance of pardon . One of Cheselden 's pupils was the Scotsman , Alexander Monro , founder of the Edinburgh medical school . Under Cheselden , he is said to have dissected more bodies than , with the utmost application , he could properly use . In Edinburgh it was another story . Bodies were scarce and the populace were jealous of their dead . Monro 's pupils tried to make do with the odd condampnit man , ' suicide or foundling babe , the bodies sometimes being divided into ten or a dozen parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public over the violation of graves , moved his school within the shelter of the university . Apprentices were called upon to sign a promise that they would not rob graves , but they signed with reservations . Under Dr Monro 's son the scarcity of bodies was chronic and crippling . Writes John Bell : On the remains of a subject fished up from a tub of spirits are demonstrated those delicate nerves which are to be avoided or divided in our operations ; and these are demonstrated once at the distance of loo feet ! Nerves and arteries which the surgeon has to dissect at the peril of his patient 's life ! ' x The rank and file of surgery figured frequently as the butts of literature . In Sir John Vanbrugh 's The Relapse ( 1696 ) the crafty surgeon Syringe happens to be passing when Lord Foppington is pinked by an angry husband . Oons , what a gash is here ! ' exclaims the surgeon to the victim , why , a man might drive a coach and six horses into your body ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little prick between the skin and the ribs , that 's all . ' The dialogue continues : Loveless : Let me see his wound . Syringe : Then you may dress it , sir ; for if anybody looks upon it , I wo n't . Loveless : Why , thou art the veriest coxcomb I ever saw . Syringe : Sir , I am not master of my trade for nothing . Only after extracting a promise of a ? 500 fee does the surgeon concede that there may be a chance of saving Foppington 's life , // provided that the victim is removed to , Syringe 's own house , the properest place to bubble him out of his money . ' A very similar sort of surgeon turns up in Henry Fielding 's Tom Jones . He is venal , he luxuriates in his own jargon , and he is at pains to correct what he supposes to be the misapprehensions of the laity . Thus , when fears are expressed that Tom 's skull may be fractured , the surgeon says : Fractures are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often attended with worse phenomena , and with more fatal consequences than fractures . People who know nothing of the matter conclude , if the skull is not fractured , all is well , whereas I had rather see a man 's skull broke all to pieces than some contusions I have met with . ' Finding that Tom Jones is not the gentleman he had supposed him to be , the surgeon quickly and angrily submits a bill for two journeys at five shillings each , two dressings at five shillings more and half-a-crown for phlebotomy . ' Surgeons were believed to spend their time lamenting the decay of such practices as nose-slitting ( a form of mayhem widespread in the previous century ) and duelling , though as yet there were few signs that the latter practice was declining . For a surgeon with a conscience ( and such did exist ) duelling presented certain ethical difficulties . It was legitimate to tend the wounds of a victim , but was it legitimate to accompany a principal to his rendezvous at dawn ? In this way a man became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and State ; yet was it not desirable to be instantly ready to save the life of an honourable man who , had been called out by a rake ? It was a subject on which Thomas Percival , writing at the end of the century , sought to give advice in his Medical Ethics . He did not find it easy . Aside from duelling , what grist was there for the surgeon ? The casualties of industry were as yet few . By twentieth century standards , traffic accidents were inconsiderable . That left dog bites , kicks from horses and fishbones in the throat . A surgeon therefore had to look to bleeding for his bread-and-butter . Unfortunately it was such a simple-seeming operation that barbers , apothecaries and quacks all felt themselves competent to perform it , and the surgeons as a body lacked legal powers to restrain t hem . Fortunately the population did not have to be badgered to give up their blood . Young and old , hearty and anaemic , they // rolled up in spring and autumn ( and sometimes oftener ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gasping , staggered bandaged home . In Yorkshire were two farrier brothers who would bleed a hundred countryfolk at a time on Sunday morn ings , one opening the veins , the other tying the arms . The patients sat on benches in a room , like so many tapped casks of claret , their blood draining away in troughs on the floor . Periodically surgeons called at the big houses to bleed the master , his family and all his servants . Those who raised their voices against this abuse of Nature were looked upon as cranks . Dr Samuel Johnson 's objection to blood-letting was based on the argument that this was an evacuation which Nature could not make of herself ; thus if a person who was habituated to being bled missed this regular relief , he might be suddenly suffocated . To the gormandising , port-swilling rich bleeding undoubtedly gave temporary surcease . In certain illnesses and fevers it quietened the pulse and alleviated pain , and was less harmful than violent vomits and purges . Often the amount of blood drawn off depended less on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surgeon . Country folk who had nothing wrong with them would expect to lose between Io and 20 ounces ; an apoplectic cleric would be drained of perhaps 50 ounces . Many patients were bled because the surgeon could think of no other treatment . Men thrown from horses , half-drowned bathers , sickly boys , pregnant women , the suddenly bereaved , even infants ? all these would be called on to yield a blood sacrifice . If he cared to compete with quacks , the surgeon could also treat venereal disease . Gentlemen of spirit were not over keen to resort to a reputable surgeon because his treatment usually re quired them to be confined to quarters for the period of the cure . James Boswell , when he found that too , too plain was Signor Gonorrhea , ' took himself to his friend Andrew Douglas , surgeon , of Pall Mall . Already he had shared Douglas 's hospitality on a happier occasion . Now he complained that Douglas , surgeon , was another man from Douglas , friend , and was as ready to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of my money as any man . ' x It was ironic that , while surgeons were lamenting lack of opportunity , every town could furnish its crop of overdue surgical // cases ( as they would now seem ) in the shape of men and women with monstrous wens and tumours , of a size and repulsiveness rarely seen today . The owners of these appendages had too little faith in the surgeon to invite him to cut them away , and for his own part the surgeon was not anxious to risk his reputation in making the attempt . Few surgeons , again , were willing to face such gambles as trying to preserve from amputation a limb with a compound fracture . The problem was brought home forcibly to Percival Pott , the outstanding surgeon of mid-century , when he was thrown from his horse one winter 's day in Southwark and sustained a multiple fracture of the leg . In the ordinary way such a sufferer would have been bled by the first surgeon who happened along and then manhandled clumsily into bed . Pott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He sent to Westminster for two chairmen , and while waiting for them bought a door from a house . When the chairmen arrived with their poles , he gave explicit orders as to how he was to be lifted on to the door and carried to his home , which was near St Paul 's . A consultation of surgeons decided that , notwithstanding all the precautions taken , the leg ought to be taken off and Pott , realising that no man can be a sound judge of his own case , concurred . By chance a senior colleague from St Bartholomew 's arrived and gave it as his opinion that the leg might be saved . It was . A surgeon without a hospital has been likened to a gardener without a garden . Hence the opening of the big voluntary hospitals was of perhaps greater benefit to the surgeons than it was to the physicians . In the wards a keen man could observe , compare , classify , specialise . If his treatment proved unsuccessful he could open the body ? surreptitiously , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handiwork or to other causes . In 1745 the fretful marriage between the surgeons and the barbers was dissolved . Men like William Cheselden and Percival Pott had no more in common with barbers than they had with bonnet-makers or pepperers . The barbers , however , were by no means in favour of divorce . They had been good enough for the surgeons in the struggling days of their union , yet now they were to be cast aside by their more ambitious partner . Nevertheless , the breach was made , and the new Company of Surgeons soon // found that pride was not enough to live on . It accepted shelter for a while from the Stationers , pending the building of its own Surgeons ' Hall , at the Old Bailey . In this headquarters it assiduously mismanaged its affairs until the end of the century , when , as a result of defalcations , neglect and incompetence , the Company had to go into dissolution . The first master of the new body was John Ranby , a rough-mannered , choleric fellow who was nicknamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a more gentlemanly example , the Company might have had a happier history . One of its more churlish acts , in the light of history , was to impose sharp fines on William Hunter when he decided to leave the Company and become a physician . The medical school which Hunter established in Great Windmill Street , London , in 1768 ( after failing to per suade the Government to give a piece of land for a similar pur pose ) was of infinite benefit to many succeeding generations of surgeons . One result of the divorce was that all surgeons were now at liberty to dissect human bodies , if they could obtain them , on their own premises , always supposing that they could persuade wives , landladies and neighbours that such exercises were neces sary for the advancement of science . Most surgeons preferred to conduct their anatomical studies at the new Surgeons ' Hall , with its notorious ground-level door through which were admitted , after many an unseemly scuffle with the mob , the bodies of those executed at Tyburn for pocket-picking , theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company 's beadles were beaten up and the windows of the Hall stoned . At each year 's end the executioners , on whose goodwill the surgeons were dependent , called at the Hall for their Christmas box. * Another result of the divorce was that dentistry was left an orphaned art . Those who wished to specialise in this branch ( that is , all who had ideas beyond mere tooth-pulling ) had to learn their skill as best they could . Dentures held in position by wires and springs were on the market , but many fashionable folk pre ferred to have the newly extracted teeth of young persons trans-planted into their gums . Rowlandson has a cartoon in which this ruthless traffic is portrayed . It is an impressive thought that a pretty girl from the country could sell her hair to the wig-maker and her teeth to the dentist before being faced with the need to // sell her virtue to a baronet . ( In her youth Lord Nelson 's Emma was on her way to dispose of her teeth when she was lured into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorious Dental Board a practitioner could adopt any whimsical method of extraction that appealed to him . A Dr Monsey , who was friendly with Garrick , would attach one end of a piece of catgut to the offending tooth and the other end to a bullet which he then fired , using a full measure of powder . Not many patients could be persuaded to try this method . One who agreed to do so lost his nerve at the last minute and cried Stop ! ' Calling him a fool and a coward , Dr Monsey discharged the firearm and the patient was delighted with the result . It was William Hunter 's younger brother John , that indefati gable dissector and collector , who put not only the surgeons , but the physicians , the apothecaries and the midwives in his debt . Thanks to the zeal of anatomists the structure of the body was reasonably well known , but the functions of its various parts were not . No living organism in the human or animal kingdom went unexplored by Hunter if it seemed likely to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or yield a clue as to how the diseases which threatened it could be fought . The records show that Hunter dissected more than 500 different species of creature , and some thousands '  --  of his fellow humans . If he could not obtain the rare beasts he required from circuses and zoos , he wrote begging letters to correspondents in Africa and Asia . To the long-suffering Edward Jenner he sent requests for salmon spawn , cuckoos ' gizzards and porpoises ' nipples . He would turn from the problem of distinguishing between male and female eels to the dissection of a whale , marvelling at the vigour of a heart , too big to , put in a wide tub , which could pump r o or 15 gallons of blood in one stroke at high velocity through a foot-wide pipe . In the grounds of his house at Earl 's Court roamed zebra , buffalojackal and leopardalong with more domesticated beasts // like bulls , with which he playfully and perilously wrestled . Old medical theories and systems impressed him no more than they had impressed Sydenham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try ? ' was his much-quoted advice . Hunter experimented on living creatures , too , causing a human tooth to grow from a cock 's comb , and a cock 's testicle to flourish in the belly of a hen . His least happy experiment was on himself , when he infected his system inadvertently with syphilis . In the intervals between dis secting he contrived to , lecture , tour the wards of St George 's Hospital and interview or visit patients . This is not the place to assess John Hunter 's wide-ranging contribution to all the branches of medical knowledge . It is sufficient to emphasise that he , more than any other man in the eighteenth century , raised the status of surgery from that of a rough-and-ready craft to something approaching a science . Hence-forth a surgeon who meant to reach the top must be not only an anatomist but physiologist and pathologist . It was a career to attract keen , questing and cultivated minds . Sir James Paget says : In the lessons of Hunter , surgery gratefully repaid medicine for the teachings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did more than anyone to make us gentlemen . ' * Whether Hunter himself was a gentleman , even in the days when he maintained his great and fashionable establishment in Leicester Square , was a subject on which not all his colleagues were agreed . At least his attitude to charging fees showed gentle-manly instincts . When asked How much ? ' his answer would be , Why , that you must determine yourself ; you are the best judge of your own circumstances and it is far from my wish to deprive you of the comforts of life . ' If he thought a patient had paid a bigger fee than he could afford , he would return a portion of it . His free list ' included not only unbeneficed clergymen but authors and artists . Knighthoods and baronetcies are a poor measure of medical reputations , but it is worth note that in 1778 surgery could point to its first baronet , Sir Caesar Hawkins , whose services had been much valued at Court . He was said to derive ? I , 000 a year from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of inocula ting the middle classes . // Among the most versatile of surgeons were those who , despairing of sharpening their skill at home , went off to follow the wars . ( John Hunter sought to recover his health , threatened by too much dissection , by treating the wounded at Belleisle . ) Though nominally surgeons , they acted also as physicians , apothecaries and even midwives . It was small wonder that they grew to look with scorn on the squabbling factions of their profession when they returned from battlefields blue with flies and isles manured with the victims of Yellow Jack . Outstanding among naval surgeons was the Scot James Lind , who in 1754 published his treatise showing how scurvy could be prevented . After a seemly interval of 40 years the Admiralty decided to issue lemon juice to ships . No one can believe , says a modern sailor , * that if Lind had been in command of Anson 's tragic round-the-world voyage he would have allowed nine men out of ten to die of scurvy before his return . Lind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh fruit and vegetables at sea , but the surgeons who begged for such supplies were up against apathy , callousness , cheeseparing and the exigencies of the service . ' A few gave up the struggle and devoted themselves to rum , leaving their mates to practise as they willed on the crew . If ever a man was left to stand on his two , feet it was the naval surgeon . The shore authorities were pleased to suppose that he abused his independence by trafficking in medicines and passing off substitutes on his patients . They therefore took care that he should be supplied with the minimum of medicaments , in order to lessen his temptations . John Atkins , author of The Navy Surgeon ( 1734 ) , complained that the Society of Apothecaries and their supervising physician put up not what the surgeon wants but what they say he wants . ' To a city surgeon cases came singly and sparsely ; he could afford to lavish full and even unnecessary attention on each one . To a naval surgeon , sooner or later , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of twelve , when his cockpit began to fill with halves of men and the decks ran , all too literally , with blood and rats . In this smoking , dust-filled shambles , with tourniquets , hot irons and bubbling pitch , the surgeon would salvage such portions of the King 's servants as seemed worth saving , while the deck tilted , plunged and shuddered beneath his feet . The rest * Surgeon-Admiral Sir Sheldon Dudley : Our National Ill-Health Service . // of the ship 's company had daring , blood-tingling tasks to do , but the surgeon 's pulse did not race like those of other men . He stayed calm and used his judgment amid scenes of agony and exultation . Many of his patients died , as they would have died if he had not sawn them , but in every seaport , and on many a quarter-deck , the presence of sailors with hooks for hands and pegs for legs was a testimony to his rough skill . And this was the man who , on being captured , was liable to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he a surgeon or was he a barber ? Even in times of peace the naval surgeon 's life was apt to be an uncommonly exacting one . Many an operation came his way that a city surgeon might have preferred to dodge . John Atkins gives some haunting details which help one to picture a trepan ning operation at sea . The feat was to be performed in a close place by candlelight , ' the justification being that air was an enemy to the brain and bone . ' The patient 's ears were plugged with wool for preventing an ungrateful sensation ' as the well-oiled instrument bit into his skull . His most grateful sensation , perhaps , was when they swept away the bone dust from time to time with a feather brush . Afterwards , Atkins warned , the patient 's hands might have to be tied to stop him tearing off his bandages . Another grisly glimpse of naval surgeons at work comes from Thomas Dover . In the South Seas , before the storming of Guayaquil , the crews of his privateering expedition caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the stacks of unburied dead in the Spanish churches . One hundred and eighty men were violently ill . I ordered the surgeons to bleed them in both arms , ' writes Dover , and to go round them all with command to leave them bleeding till all were blooded , and then come and tie them up in their turns . Thus they lay bleeding and fainting , so long , that I could not conceive they could lose less than an hundred ounces per man : * This mighty blood-letting , says Dover , saved the lives of the crew . John Knyveton left a colourful record of his activities as surgeon 's mate in the Seven Years ' War.t His labours on board Ramillies began before she sailed from Portsmouth ; some 62 out of 200 sailors had to be rejected because they suffered from the // pox . After that there were bruises from the press gang to be healed . When the voyage began he was kept busy attending men who had fallen from the rigging , or who had been too heartily belaboured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the captain 's dogs , and for good measure treated the dogs too . One captain depicted by Knyveton was like a caricature from Smollett . Taking upon himself to diagnose the sick , he ordered a string to be tied round each man 's waist . If the pain was above the string , the man received an emetic ; if below the string , a purge . According to Knyveton , two men treated in accordance with this diagnosis died violently . The least pleasant task of a ship 's surgeon was one he shared with the army surgeon : to superintend the flogging of a malefactor and judge to a second and a sinew when the man had had enough . The mere fact that backbone and ribs were laid bare did not necessarily mean that it was time to call off the punishment . Sometimes the surgeon 's judgment was at fault and the man died ; sometimes , in the captain 's view , he intervened earlier than he need have done , thus frustrating justice and weakening discipline . It was one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allay or avert pain , not to prolong it ? clashed with his duty to society . The army surgeon , no less than his naval colleague , had to be able to turn his hand to all tasks . From that satirical work Advice to Officers of the British Army ( 1782 ) , attributed to Francis Grose , it is clear that his more routine duties are concerned with bleeding , purging , poulticing and treating sufferers from venereal disease ( tenderness towards patients of that kind is only an encouragement of vice ' ) . Evidently there were perquisites other than those to be derived from passing off substitute drugs . Inoculation affords a pretty comfortable douceur to gentlemen of your profession , ' runs the advice , a guinea per head being allowed by the Government for that operation . But as it is only to be performed with the soldier 's consent , you should recollect , that the common people are commonly blind to their own interest , and therefore persuade as many as you can to agree to what is so much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lancets ; a blunt one for the soldiers , and a sharp one for the officers ; this will be making a proper distinction between them . ' That this is no idle jest is clear from Knyveton 's diary . // The surgeon under whom he served on Ramillies kept a special set of instruments to use on officers . In times of peace , the surplus surgeons of the Services became general practitioners and were as skilled and reliable as any in the country . What a pity , ' wrote Dr Thomas Beddoes , that such men are not more solidly grounded , and more highly finished by those who undertake to form their minds . ' IX THE WICKED MAN-MIDWIFE TOWARDS the middle of the eighteenth century a , new kind of name plate was to be seen in the towns of England . It bore the legend Surgeon , Apothecary and Man-Midwife . ' The man-midwife edged on to the scene nervously . He knew that he was a figure of suspicion , fun and contempt . He was fighting the prejudice of many thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midwifery was by ancient tradition a woman 's task ; it was unseemly and immoral for a man to be called to attend a woman in labour , unless her life was in danger ; the practice would put an end to , female modesty ; even if midwifery were a fit task for a man , it was no task for a gentleman ; it was a mere money-catching innovation by doctors who had built up a superfluous science and were trading on the fears of ignorant women ; and it was a gross waste of a doctor 's time and training to expect him to officiate at such a routine commonplace as childbirth . Under the laws of the medieval Church man-midwifery had been a capital offence . In 1522 the impious Dr Wertt , of Hamburg , dressed himself as a woman in order to study the problems of a woman in labour , and for his enterprise was burned at the stake . Ambroise Pare , it may be supposed , came up against clerical opposition during that same century , when he reintroduced the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the womb in order to ensure an easier delivery . If this was not trying to improve on the work of Providence , what was it ? Long after Pare , the man-midwife continued to be the victim of a prudery which sometimes forced him to operate blindly beneath a sheet , one end of which might be tied to his neck , the other end to that of his patient . If the child was lost , at least modesty was saved . This system did not render any easier the task of witnesses 94 // charged with guarding against substitutions at royal births . On the other hand , it doubtless aided the Chamberlen family to preserve the secret of their forceps . Prudery , of course , did not go with pregnancy alone ; an excessively sensitive woman troubled with bodily pains anywhere between neck and knee might indicate their whereabouts to her physician by reference to a doll specially manufactured for that purpose . The fashion of the man-midwife came to Britain from France , whence those equivocal fellows , the man-hairdresser and the man-staymaker had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mistresses , and what was good enough for royal mistresses was good enough for the grandes dames of the French court . Soon the trade of accoucheur was booming . High-born ladies in England were not to be left behind and gradually the vogue spread to the middle classes . The first man-midwife of distinction in England was Sir Richard Manningham , who established a ward for parturient women in Britain , at the parish infirmary of St James , Westminster . It was he who , in 1726 , exposed the famous imposition at Godalming by Mary Tofts , the rabbit breeder . ' Her story was that she had been so frightened by a rabbit that her reproductive system had undergone a change and she was able to give birth only to rabbits , of which she had borne 15 that year . The local apothecary , John Howard , endorsed her story and said that he had felt the rabbits leaping in her womb . Nathanael St Andre , surgeon to Westminster Hospital , was called in and was tricked to such good purpose that he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth to two rabbits or portions thereof . By this time the country was agog and not a few citizens lost their taste for rabbit pie . The rents of warrens fell . At Court pregnant ladies began to fear they were in the same predicament as Mary Tofts . Conscious of public alarm , George I sent his German physician , Cyriacus Ahlers , to , investigate . This gentleman was left holding a portion of another rabbit but was not quite satisfied with the way in which it had come into his possession . The King , after hearing Ahlers ' sceptical report , sent down Sir Richard Manningham , who speedily disposed of the miracle . The rabbits and portions of rabbits , he said , were concealed about the lady 's person . The only mystery was whether the affair was a vulgar hoax or whether Tofts suffered from an obscure form of mania . The case prompts the reflection that eminent physicians // had still a good deal to learn about the potentialities and limitations of the human reproductive system . If the illustrations are any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedsheet , without which the nonsense could never have been perpetrated . One who did much to break down the superstition and prejudice surrounding childbirth was Dr William Smellie , of Lanark . In 1741 he taught midwifery at his own house in London with the aid of a lay figure composed of human bones encased in leather , and little stuffed babies . ' He is said to have instructed some 1,000 pupils , who. paid the expenses of more than that number of poor women whom they attended . Mrs Elizabeth Nihell , a leading West End midwife of the day , resented this male competition and mocked Smellie as a great horse-godmother of a he-midwife . ' She said that in his loose gown , behind which he concealed his instruments , he not only played the part of a man-woman but looked like one . Smellie was a friend of William Hunter , who in mid-century switched his interest from surgery to midwifery . Smellie 's writings on midwifery fell into the hands of the ineffable Philip Thicknesse , who wrote a pamphlet Man-Alidwifery Analysed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Addressed to all men in general and to all married women in particular , ' it was designed to put a stop to impure acts , immodest actions and the indelicate , unchaste and unnecessary transactions of men-midwives , such as they avowedly and publicly profess , and such that every man of sense , decency , sentiment and spirit must and will disapprove or be totally in ? different different as to his wife 's conduct or his own honour . ' Dr Smellie 's handbook contained references to clinical tounhing , and that was enough to sustain Thicknesse in a long diatribe against the Touching Gentry . ' He declares : I never meet any of these charioted mongrel physicians , that I do not look on them as I should on the Emperor of Morocco or the Bashaw of Tangier , going to his seraglio . ' There is only one state in which a fine woman ' can present herself without stirring base passions , says Thicknesse , and that is in the act of dying . Of Tbicknesse it was said , as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an air of majesty . If he had been a lone critic , his protests would not have been worthy of examination , but he was bold enough to voice the fears of many appreCALL // hensive husbands . He made one point that was worth making : that man-midwives tended to make unnecessary use of the new mechanical aids to delivery . No one who has read Tristram Shandy will forget Dr Slop , who knocked out three of his own teeth while manipulating his forceps . Nor was that his only dangerous device ? Good God , ' cried my Uncle Toby , are children brought into the world with a squirt ? ' Although eminent physicians were assisting at the births of princes and princesses , the Royal College of Physicians still looked on man-widwives as outside the professional pale . Nor were the Surgeons any more eager to countenance the practice . This negative attitude gave ammunition to the critics who , year in , year out , accused the two corporations of being hopelessly out of touch with their commonalty . x COUNTRY DOCTOR Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fell in a puddle Right up to his middle , And never went there again . ? Nursery rhyme WHEREAS the London physician demanded a guinea a. mile for his forays by coach into the country , the rural practitioner was content to ride his horse perhaps 4,000 miles a year over moor and bog to earn &200.; It was an employment for the physically strong and the mentally independent , and as such made a special appeal to former Army and Navy surgeons , hardened by campaigning in bar1 arous places . As a rule the country practitioner was an apothecary with some training as a surgeon . He was ready to administer physic , perform amputations on kitchen tables , or deliver babies . I le might have a small shop in the high street , or what passed for the high street , where seekers after novelty could buy soap and toothbrushes and the local Calvinists could snort at the sight of perfumery and scented soap . There might be a jar of leeches kept for the squire or laird , but the chances were that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger towns the country doctor might display a human skull or a monkey 's skeleton in his window to attest his knowledge of anatomy . It %N as a humble enough business , but at least the owner of it did not have to suffer the ignominy of seeing his more passe drugs tossed into the street by liberally educated gentlemen . Sir Walter Scott in The Surgeon 's Daughter gives an excellent picture of the conditions which faced the rural practitioner in Scotland in the late eighteenth century : 99 // He has none of the ample resources proper to the brothers of the profession in an English town . The burgesses of a Scottish borough are rendered , by their limited means of luxury , inaccessible to gout , surfeits and all the comfortable chronic diseases , which are attendant on wealth and indolence . Four years , or so , of abstemiousness enable them to stand an election dinner ; and there is no hope of broken heads among a score or two of quiet electors , who settle the business over a table . There the mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of every revolving year , a certain quantity of doctor 's stuff through the bowels of their beloved children . Every old woman , from the Townhead to the Townfit , can prescribe a dose of salts , or spread a plaster .. In this type of community the doctor was sent for only in emergencies . There were some parts of Scotland , notably in the Outer Isles , where a doctor was regarded , not only as a luxury , but as a superfluity . The isles folk were fatalists , and justified their refusal to call a doctor on the grounds that the hour has come . ' This attitude survived even into the twentieth century . The Scots explorer Mungo Park practised physic in and out of Peebles when not exploring the basin of the Niger . According to Scott , he preferred the rigours of African travel to those of his native hills . He mentioned having once upon a time rode 40 miles , sat up all night , and successfully assisted a woman under influence of the primitive curse , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draught of butter-milk . But his was not the heart which grudged the labour that relieved human misery . In short , there is no creature in Scotland that works harder and is more poorly requited than the country doctor , unless perhaps it may be his horse . ' The horse was , indeed , a heroic partner . There were times when the doctor slept in the saddle , and the beast was left to pick its own way by bog and ravine . The doctor 's patients would see the sleeping figure riding up the glens and perhaps give thanks that he was asleep , for it was hard to look him in the eye when they owed him so much ; but they could show their sympathy by seeing that the horse took the right turn at the crossroads . Occasionally the doctor would be intercepted by a labourer with toothache . Then he would dismount and perform the necessary extraction at the roadside , watched perhaps by a group of delighted children whom he had brought without fee into the world . Iot COUNTRY DOCTOR In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor and beast might wander for hours on their native moors , hopelessly lost , or fall into deep pits which the snow concealed . Flooded rivers would compel the doctor to make long detours ? or , if the call was urgent , he would wade through and arrive at the bedside drenched . On stormy , moonless nights he might be guided over the moors by a peasant carrying a burning peat . If not , he would have to trust to instinct ? and his horse . It was one of the ironies of the country doctor 's lot that , having returned from a spot twenty miles away , he might have to turn round and visit another patient who lived perhaps only a mile or two from the first . This hardship was accepted more stoically than it would be in an age of telephones . Not all country doctors lived obscure lives . One who helped to change the course of history was Edward Jenner , discoverer of vaccination , who practised at Berkeley in Gloucestershire . It will be remembered that he kept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he supplied with unusual specimens for dissection . If he could not listen to , learned orations in London , at least he could exchange knowledge with his colleagues in near-by towns ; he attended a gathering at Alveston which he styled convivio-medical and one at Rodborough which he called medico-convival . Though Gloucestershire was less rugged than Scotland , it could provide unusual rigours . There was a January day in 1786 when Jenner , riding to Kingscote in intense cold , arrived ice-caked and almost senseless , unable to dismount . I had just recollection and power enough to prevent the servants from bringing me to a fire , ' he said afterwards . They carried him to the stables , where he partially thawed , then at length into the house . On that bitter journey the horse lost part of the cuticle and hair on the . International fame did not lure Jenner for long from his beloved countryside . For once , the services of a man honoured by almost every medical body in the world ( except the Royal College of Physicians ) were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to impress at least one of his patients , a beldam who told him : So your book is out at last . Well , I can tell you there beant a copy sold in this town nor sha n't be if I can help it . ' // There was another country doctor who achieved a measure of limelight at this time , the Rev. Francis Willis , of Gretford , who trained originally for the Church . In a hospital at Lincoln , and in his own house at Gretford , he was unusually successful in treating the mentally deranged . In 1788 , when George III suffered his breakdown , Willis was called to Court , despite the misgivings of the Queen who realised that his visit would confirm to the world the nature of the King 's malady . Already the mobs were stopping the Court physicians in their carriages , accusing them of incompetence and threatening to murder them . Willis was all but ostracised by some of the Court physicians but bore the snubs bravely , bringing a breath of fresh air to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diary called him a man of ten thousand , open , honest , dauntless , light-hearted , innocent and high-minded . ' Some of Willis 's pronouncements suggest that he was not quite such a repository of the virtues as this might suggest ; the Opposition belaboured him as a tool and a fool . Willis tried to cure the King by kindness and trust , horrifying his colleagues by giving him a razor with which to shave . Once the King asked Willis whether , as a clergyman , he was not ashamed of himself for practising as a physician . Our Saviour , sir , went about healing the sick , ' replied Willis ; to which the King retorted , Ah , yes , but he did n't get ? 700 a year for it ? hey ? ' So far , medical treatment of the poor has not figured very largely in these pages , though it will call for much attention later . Since Queen Elizabeth 's day the parishes had been responsible for looking after their own poor , and this duty they discharged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has left an unforgettable picture of the worst type of parish apothecary , going his perfunctory rounds in the poorhouse : Anon a figure enters , quaintly neat , All pride and business , bustle and conceit ; With looks unalter 'd by these scenes of woe , With speed that , entering , speaks his haste to go , He bids the gazing throng around him fly , And carries fate and physic in his eye : I03 COUNTRY DOCTOR A potent quack , long versed in human ills , Who first insults the victims whom he kills ; Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy Bench protect , And whose most tender mercy is neglect . Paid by the parish for attendance here , He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer ; In haste he seeks the bed where Misery lies , Impatience mark 'd in his averted eyes ; And , some habitual queries hurried o'er , Without reply , he rushes to the door ; His drooping patient , long inured to pain , And long unheeded , knows remonstrance vain ; He ceases now the feeble help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' But not all the poor suffered at the hands of insolence . Men like the Quaker Dr J. C. Lettsom did their best for the humble . Once , he sent to the overseers of a parish a note reading : A shilling per diem for Mrs Maxton : Money , not physic , will cure her . Lettsom . ' Whether Mrs Maxton received her shilling per diem is not told ; it seems unlikely . Dr Lettsom was reputed to disburse at the houses of the poor more money than he took . His fellow Quaker , Dr Fothergill , often made the act of feeling the pulse a cover for slipping money into the patient 's hand . Nor were these two unique . Many parish doctors paid for meat and porter for the poor out of their own pockets . It was Lettsom who , in 177o , founded the General Dispensary , the first of many such institutions to be opened in the latter quarter of the century . Within their walls , doctors extended their knowledge of the poor and saw something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industrial age . XI HUMBUGS IF the aristocrats of medicine were to be believed , the ranks of quacks were composed of sow-gelders , shady apothecaries , unfrocked priests , French shampooers , corn-cutters , bath-house keepers , urinarians , mystics , executioners , presumptuous midwives , itinerant abortionists , sleight-of-hand men , mechanick fellows , ' shiftless craftsmen and runaway husbands turned satyr . Not usually listed were the kings and queens of England who for centuries , abetted by their physicians , had set an example of bare-faced quackery by touching ' the afflicted ; a custom which died only with Queen Anne . Most of the characters enumerated in the opening paragraph did , indeed , adorn the gallery of quacks in the eighteenth century , but there were others who , while lacking university degrees and the ability to abuse each other in Latin , could perform cures , often by manipulation , which orthodox practitioners either could not or would not attempt . There were infinite categories of quacks , among them the following : Those who honestly believed they had a skill or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines were no worse than those of the orthodox ; Those who manufactured medicines from the Pharmacopeia under a different name , advertised them widely and sold them cheaply ; Those who knew their medicines or treatments were worthless but who were able to cure , or alleviate , certain conditions by instilling confidence in recovery ; Those who had no skill and no morals and were intent only on extracting the maximum income from the credulous ( as by pre- // tending to remove a stone from an insane patient 's head or by using hot wires to burn out worms ' from aching teeth ) . The borders of quackery were as ill-determined as they are today . A Scots doctor would be regarded as a quack because he had studied only three years instead of five . Yet a physician with an Oxford degree might espouse a new-fangled theory of treat ment which would bring cries of Quack ' from his more con servative colleagues ? and even from Scots doctors . George Crabbe , writing on quacks , found it mortifying ' That creatures , Nature meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , country seats . ' * No , doubt many doctors shared these sentiments , and deplored the way in which quacks were draining away custom from the profession . A more powerful , and more disinterested , objection was that quacks had no responsibility to their patients . If an illness took a turn for the worse they could vanish , leaving a physician , summoned too late , to explain away the patient 's death . Few quacks had any diagnostic ability or knew how to regulate the administration of drugs according to the needs of the individual ; but objections on these grounds did not come very well from physicians who diagnosed at second-hand in coffee-houses . The story of quackery is not without its triumphs , but it is also a story of roguery , criminal neglect and culpable homicide , and it was this aspect which , chiefly , roused the orthodox pro fession to anger . The Court throughout the eighteenth century was nearly as hospitable to quacks as in Elizabeth 's reign . It was not impossible for an unlicensed operator to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favourite oculist , succeeded in doing . From this eminence , a man could thumb his nose at the Royal College of Physicians , or write impudent pamphlets dedicated to them . Joshua ( ' Spot ' ) Ward , the most famous quack of his day , was called in by George II to examine that monarch 's painful thumb . The view of the elite of the Royal College was that the condition of the thumb was caused by gout , I nut Ward knew a dislocation when he saw one . Without making any comment , he seized the thumb and gave it a violent jerk . When the monarch had finished cursing him and kicking him on the shins , he found that he could wag his thumb again . As part // of his reward , Ward was given the right to drive through St James 's Park , and for good measure a coach with six horses in which to do so , . Without the knowledge of her physicians , Princess Caroline was persuaded by Lord Hervey ? the King and Queen concurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Queen was assured that the pill had driven nobody mad except Dr Mead . Perhaps Ward 's greatest triumph was to be excused , by special direction of Parliament , from compliance with the Apothecaries Act of 1748 , which was designed to stop unqualified persons compounding pills . Although many quacks found it convenient to change their addresses frequently , others could boast a fixed abode . One might keep a shop and display in his window a row of bottles , each containing a worm conjured from a satisfied patient . Another might set himself up near a hospital , in order to , catch the overflow of out-patients . Others , according to their handbills , were ready to consult patients at coffee-houses . Quacks who sought custom outside London did so with little fear of interference by orthodox physicians . The worst that could befall them was to be thrown into the village pond by dissatisfied customers . Those who peddled the more perilous cures would be careful not to return to the same district too often , thus giving the blinded a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his state of prosperity , a quack might travel by foot , horse or carriage . He might stage a popular entertainment in the market place or on the village green , with clowns and tumblers , wire-walkers and trumpeters , and award bottles of elixir as prizes in lotteries . He would know all Joe Miller 's jokes by heart . Any patient dissatisfied with the medicine would reflect that at least he had enjoyed a free entertainment . A more conservative type of quack would take rooms at the local inn and post up notices inviting sufferers to call at stated times , bringing their waters with them . ' If prosperous enough , he might employ an advance publicity man to precede him with stories of his miraculous cures . Once established in residence , he would ornament his headquarters with his diplomas and letters patent , and deck his person with the medals bestowed on him by foreign courts . In The Tatler , Addison relates that quacks were fully conscious of the need to support themselves by collateral assistances ' or supernumerary accomplishments . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' At one time , Addison says , it was impossible to walk the streets without having thrust into one 's hand an advertisement of a doctor who was arrived at the knowledge of the green and red dragon , and had discovered the female fern seed . ' He comments : Nobody ever knew what this meant ; but the green and red dragon so amused the people that the doctor lived very comfortably upon them . ' Another prosperous fellow plastered the street corners with the magic word TETRACHYMAGOGON ; much impressed , the sick would have nobody but this learned man for their physician . ' Addison also mentions receiving the advertisement of one who had studied 30 years by candlelight for the good of his countrymen , ' and comments : He might have studied twice as long by daylight and never been taken notice of . ' Dr Tom Saffold , heelmaker turned pox-doctor , was one of many who sought to fascinate potential patients by skill at doggerel , but a more successful poetaster was Saff old 's successor , Dr Case , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place Lives Doctor Case . ' Testifies Addison : He is said to have got more by this distich than Mr Dryden did by all his works . ' Scorning doggerel , Chevalier ' John Taylor , an eye doctor of Norwich , who toured the courts of Europe for 30 years , preferred to make speeches in what he called the true Ciceronian , prodigiously difficult and never attempted in our language before . ' It consisted of starting every sentence with the genitive and ending it with a verb , and was probably as good a way of impressing the uneducated as any . Dr Samuel Johnson described Taylor as an instance of how far impudence will carry ignorance . ' Taylor 's autobiography , which fortunately is not written in the true Ciceronian , is a disappointing effort for one who claimed acquaintance with every Court , kingdom , province , state , city and town of the least consideration in all Europe without exception . ' It is full of unauthenticated , second-hand stories with titles like An account of a young lady who lost her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom she supposed to be single , ' and Making love to nuns sheaved to be a species of cruelty . ' In his travels , says Taylor , he met many quacks who faced sentences of death if they returned to their native lands . I09 HUMBUGS He claims to have learned many secrets of medicine , but says that only harm can befall if he publishes his knowledge to the ignorant ; the information will be passed on to his respectable successors . ' In passing , the Chevalier complains about critics who cast up at him his occasional unsuccessful operations , though transacted in the beginning of my life . ' A Barnum-style quack was Martin Van Butchell , whose most famous advertising asset was provided for him by William Hunter . At the quack 's request Hunter embalmed the body of the first Mrs Van Butchell , giving it the lifelike treatment afforded by the American mortician in our own times . The mummy was then displayed in Van Butchell 's dwelling , where no doubt it instilled a sober and reflective state of mind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty relict , persuaded her husband to send it to John Hunter 's museum . Quick wits were indispensable weapons in the quack 's armoury . Sir Edward Halse , physician to George III , was driving through the Strand when the progress of his carriage was impeded by a crowd listening to a harangue by one Dr Rock . The latter , recognising the equipage , ordered a quantity of boxes and phials to be handed to the footman , saying , Give my compliments to Sir Edward and tell him these are all I have with me but I am sending for ten dozen more tomorrow . ' The crowd were quick to appreciate that even the King 's physician took his medicines from Rock . Later Halse is said to have tackled Rock , who had once been a fellow student : My old friend , how can a man of your understanding condescend to harangue the populace with such nonsense as you talked today ? Why , none but fools listen to you . ' The reply was : Ah , my good friend ... do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my free leave to keep the people of sense for your own . ' ( A similar exchange is said to have occurred between Dr Radcliffe and Dr Case . ) It was left to a woman quack to pull off a much-admired coup , of which the only victims were the taxpayers . She was Mrs Joanna Stephens , whose solvent for the stone enjoyed a vogue in higher circles . Why , she argued , should not the nation pay her for her valuable secret ? As an experiment , a sufferer from the stone was treated with Mrs Stephens ' compound and the obstacle disappeared . By dint of much intriguing , with encouragement from nobles and churchmen , and not least with the aid of two pamphlets from David Hartley , philosopher and Fellow of Jesus College , // Cambridge , Parliament was induced to vote ? 5,000 to Mrs Stephens for her secret . It turned out that the solvent was com pounded of snail shells , egg shells and soap . It also turned out that the patient on whom the experiment was tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in a pouch at the back of the bladder . Since then , writes William Wadd , there have been as many human calculi formed by His Majesty 's liege subjects as would macadamise one side of Lincoln 's Inn Fields : * Had Parliament contained fewer who suffered from the stone and more who needed the bonesetter , it is possible that Mrs Sally Mapp might also have been honoured by a grant . Crazy Sal , a roaring , uncouth creature , whose sister married a Duke of Bolton , settled in Epsom , where she treated many of the fashionable world . So many did she attract that the town authorities are said to have offered her loo guineas to continue in residence there . Percival Pout , the surgeon , described her in the contemptuous terms reserved by the profession for unlicensed bonesetters as an ignorant , illiberal , drunken , female savage . ' In her prime she rode in a coach-and-six and looked opulent and ugly enough to be mistaken by the crowd for one of George II 's mistresses . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , variously known as the urine-caster , the urinarian and the piss-prophet . He professed to be able to discern , from holding a phial to the light or merely weighing it in his hands , the sex , age , ailment and prospects of his client . Like the physician of Chaucer 's day , the water-doctor would be at pains to gather advance information about his patients . In the ante-room , where the patients sat nursing their phials , would be a creature of the doctor in the guise of a patient . It was this individual 's function ( never a very difficult one ) to start up a conversation in which the patients would babble away about their symptoms , or about the symptoms of those whose contributions they bore . Behind a thin wall containing a spyhole would lurk the doctor , busily taking notes and descriptions . When satisfied that he had amassed sufficient information , he would put on his street clothes , leave the house by the back and come bustling in at the front door as if he had just returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one by one , and the doctor in his gravest manner , glancing at the phial and asking no questions , would tell them what they already knew , namely that their husbands III HUMBUGS had back pains or that their mistresses were pregnant . Such would be the visitor 's astonishment and respect that the doctor would have no difficulty in selling his expensive drugs . The patient would perhaps have heard already the story ( which each water-doctor took care to circulate about himself ) about the joker who brought a specimen of horse urine and was told by the undeluded water-caster , Feed the patient with hay and oats and let him work less . ' So many light-minded individuals tried to score off the water-doctor by bringing him bogus specimens that he made a point of subjecting each new patient to a solemn scrutiny , under which the impostor was liable to break down . In the 177os a Dr Myersbach came to England from Germany and amassed a respectable fortune by water-divining . The public had a high regard for any doctor ' with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about urine than a chambermaid , Dr J. C. Lettsom set out to expose him in a pamphlet. * This related how a male patient who had offered a phial of gelding 's urine had been told that his wife suffered from a disorder of the womb , and that a phial of cow 's urine had been identified as the produce of a young gallant who had been too free with the ladies of the town . Myersbach 's main source of intelligence was his porter Schroeder , an adept at encouraging confidences from the patients , and there were other servants who lurked about the house listening in to unguarded conversations . When a person of rank came to consult the doctor and the porter was unable to obtain information about his disease , the caller would be told that the Doctor was not at home but would be willing to see him next day . In the interval it would be the servants ' duty to make contact with some member of the patient 's household and find out his habits and ailments . The simple but indestructible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diagnosis exasperated more orthodox physicians . Dr Radcliffe , when visited by a shoemaker 's wife with a vial of her husband 's urine , is said to have refilled it with some of his own and said : Go tell your husband to make me a pair of shoes by this water ; for he will know by it how to fit my foot as well as I can by his water know what disease he has . ' Shake speare 's Falstaff entertained the same simple faith as the shoe-maker 's wife , to judge by the following : ' Boy ! what said the doctor to my water ? ' // He said , sir , the water itself was a good healthy water ; but for the party that owned it he might have more diseases than he knew for . ' It was inevitable that the more disreputable diseases should attract the quacks . Dr Case undertook to cure what he modestly called the Grand P ' and one of his handbills carried this invitation : All ye that are of Venus Race Apply yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of PILLS , Will soon remove your painful ILLS . Since not all afflicted citizens were willing to be seen striding up to , and into , the P Doctor 's premises , many quacks stressed the secrecy , not only of their remedy , but of their premises . The man who had sought over-rashly for pleasure ' was urged to call at such a place , the Golden Head or Ball , a Light at the Door at Even , and a good shelter to bolt in , or some back door in such an alley , left open for the purpose . There he would find , as the author of the foregoing explained , that there were medicines at all prices as well as mistresses . Treatment would start with a three half-crowns bolus , ' a half-crown box of pills or a five shillings pot of electuary ; but the patient would pay out fifty half-crowns before finding his way to hospital . Some quacks treating the Grand Pox would drum up trade by employing servants to dog gentlemen home from brothels . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the day before , he durst have sworn he see him go into such a house ; but no matter for he was always tender of a gentleman 's reputation . ' The gentleman would then buy his peace as best he could , recognising blackmail when he saw it . Many quacks in this field undertook to cure the patient without confining him to quarters or requiring him to undergo any form of self-discipline . No effective legislation was passed against self-appointed pox-doctors until 1917 . There were few aids to health which could not be furnished by quacks ? balsams and boluses , drenches and drops , electuaries and elixirs , ointments and opiates , salves and sugar-plums . All were described by such adjectives as angelical , royal , sovereign , incomparable , odoriferous , admirable , infallible , unfailing , gloriCALL // ous and imperial . One of the best-known of all specifics was the Famous Anodyne Necklace , the beads of which , by giving off a salutiferous emanation , ' speeded up teething in children . Supposedly the beads were made of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Orient by a priest and converted into beads in a turner 's garret . St Hugh in his lifetime had had a way with children . When he dipped his finger in holy water and rubbed it nine times over the gums of an infant , out popped the tooth . The Anodyne Necklace was marketed by a member of the Chamberlen family and must have brought in considerably more wealth than even the secret forceps . The Necklace , at least , did no harm . Nor , perhaps , did Jerusalem waters drawn from the Thames . But at their worst the specifics of the quacks , incorporating as they often did anti-mony and arsenic , were lethal stuff . One charlatan bought and marketed a great parcel of the coarsest and foulest horse aloes ' which had been refused by numerous farriers for fear of killing their beasts . The results of taking such mixtures were unpredict-able : it is like ten or twenty people 's falling down a precipice where one or two only have the luck to escape and that not by their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century the electrical quack , fired by the nerve-twitching experiments of Galvani and Volta , seized his opportunity to exploit the gullible . To most people the qualities of the electric fluid ' were as dimly comprehended as they were by the Duke of Cumberland when , in 1746 , he took an experimental shock with the tip of his Culloden sword . Dr James Graham made a fortune out of his notorious Celestial Bed , in which the magnetico-electrical influences , combined with sweet harmonies and perfume , spurred jaded couples to blissful and productive union ( fee per night ? I oo and upwards ) . Even more successful , in his way , was Elisha Perkins , a Yale graduate , who marketed on both sides of the Atlantic his electrical tractors . These were small rods made up of various kinds of metal , said to be able to remove pain when rolled back and forth over the affected area . A poet hymned them : See , pointed metals , blest with power t'appease The ruthless rage of merciless disease ! ' // A Perkinean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 to the inventor 's fortune . The tractors cost up to five guineas a pair , and as Oliver Wendell Holmes has pointed out , buyers of such expensive devices were determined to be cured by them ? and consequently were. * Perkins received copious testimonials from persons in all ranks . He was discredited largely through the efforts of Dr John Hay garth , a Yorkshireman , who achieved similar results using rollers made of wood , and even bones and slate pencils . The tractors were a triumph , not of electro-therapy , but of psycho-therapy . Quacks abused each other in pamphlets , just like qualified doctors . They also abused the profession at large . Can it be expected , ' wrote Francis Spilsbury , only begetter of Spilsbury 's Anti-Scorbutic Drops , that those so opulent practitioners , already drowned in profusion of voluptuousness , pleasure and luxury , will exert their thickened and congealed imaginations in the improvement of an Art the very defects and imperfections of which alone constitute that unfathomable golden mine whence they draw all their wealth ? ' The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole disease , its cause , source , principle and antidote and attends to no other whatever is infinitely more likely to discover a true and effica cious remedy against it than those who , forced to practise on a larger scale , can not bestow a sufficient time upon any in particular ... ' Spilsbury subscribed heartily to the fallacy of a later day , namely , that if a product was advertised it must be good . To advertise a medicine all over England , the minimum sum re quired , he said , was ? 800 or ? 900 a year ; to advertise it well cost ? 1,500 . Obviously , he explained , a bad medicine could not last long .  --  Alas , the facts of history are against him . Spilsbury was inspired to defend the empirics by the con troversy which followed the death of Oliver Goldsmith , who had consumed injudicious quantities of Dr James ' Fever Powder . The fault lay not in the specific , said Spilsbury , but in the little sense and judgment in the poor head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , he argued , might the law prohibit muskets because sometimes accidents happened . In the same pamphlet Spilsbury took the opportunity to // publicise his dispensary for the poor , whom he treated gratis . The poor did not obtain their scorbutic drops without their proper share of form filling , however . The application form ran : Figure Spilsbury published a good many testimonials from persons who had seen holes in their legs vanish after suitable treatment . It is quite possible that these testimonials were also obtained on // forms designed for the purpose . A practitioner as conscious of his own rectitude as Spilsbury claimed to be would hardly have demanded the filling in of a testimonial before starting the cure ; a practice not unknown during the century . In 1785 Spilsbury lent the vigour of his pen to fighting a vicious Parliamentary measure designed to embarrass the long-suffering race of medicine men . Let Britain talk no more of virtue , honour , valour , humanity , charity or whatever ennobles man , exalts a State or dignifies a King , ' he exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anti-Scorbutic Drops and many other sovereign remedies were now faced with the imposi tion of a stamp duty . To such depths had England sunk that a King should sign an act that when his subject was bit by a mad dog it demanded a tribute from the terrified sufferer or no medicine to heal his wound . ' William Pitt would wrest a tax from the helpless female servant who , because of the imbecility ( sic ) of her sex demands the friendly aid of medicine at certain times . ' Even worse , the measure would encourage the spread of the French pox . Would Rome have thus chid her sons who had indiscreetly sacrificed to Nature 's laws ? ' * But the quacks had their revenge . Forced , in due course , to carry an official stamp on their products , they pointed to it as a sign that these had the approval and recommendation of the Government . Many physicians were willing , unofficially , to prescribe secret remedies if the patient professed faith in them . This course was legitimate , says Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient was first apprised of the fallacy of his expectations . ' In such instances , he argues , some indulgence seems to be re quired of a credulity that is insurmountable , and the patient should neither incur the displeasure of the physician nor be entirely deserted by him . ' There were undoubtedly a few well-advertised remedies which had virtue in them , and which survive , in modified form , in our own days . One or two of them were marketed , covertly , by orthodox physicians . Dr John Brown , originator of the ' Bruno nian ' system , refused an offer from a group of speculators to lend his name to a pill , although by so doing he would have lifted himself out of financial difficulties . When Edward Jenner published a book dealing with an // improved preparation of tartar emetic , John Hunter wrote to him : Do you mean to take out a patent ? Do you mean to advertise it ? Or do you mean to let it take its chance ? I approve of it much and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would also advise you to burn your book or you will have all the world making it . ' Hunter also suggested finding a better name for the product ? ' Let it be called Jenner 's Tartar Emetic . ' Drewry Ottley , an early biographer of Hunter , mentions this as an example of that want of professional feeling occasionally displayed by Hunter . ' Others consider that Hunter was merely being facetious . Jenner made no attempt to exploit the prepara tion . Attempts to persuade Parliament to legislate against quacks usually met with little encouragement . The law-makers and the intellectuals of the day held no high opinion of orthodox medi cine and , as a rule , were quick to suspect attempts by its warring branches to enrich themselves at each other 's expense . A little quackery , they thought , was no bad thing if it helped to ginger the gentry with the gold-headed canes . Even the insolences perpetrated by the Scots universities as when Edinburgh made an illiterate brush-maker a doctor of physic and St Andrews awarded a degree to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one time an attempt was made to enlist the support of Dr Adam Smith , the political economist , in the campaign against quack ' doctors from Scotland , but he professed himself unable to see what all the fuss was about . Do not all the old women in the country practise physic without exciting a murmur or a complaint ? And if here and there a graduated doctor should be as ignorant as an old woman , where can be the great harm ? ' he asked . No university , in his view , could be certain that a man was fit to practise physic . If the graduates of Oxford and Cambridge had been able to maintain their monopoly , the cost of feeling a pulse would have been doubled or tripled ; hence the Scots invasion served as a corrective to what would otherwise soon grow up to be an intolerable nuisance , the exclusive and corporation spirit of all thriving professions and of all great universities . ' * XII SLINGS AND ARROWS As if Sydenham had never lived , the theory-spinners continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nurture them to lusty lunacy on carefully selected facts . The more far-fetched a theory was , the more fiercely it was defended . Sooner or later , another savant would be found to be working on parallel lines , but instead of being hailed as an ally on the road to ultimate truth , or even claimed as a disciple , he would be attacked as a pirate and plagiarist . Pupils assailed their masters , masters savaged their pupils . Universities were ravaged by feuds and boycotts , careers were blasted . A sad bibliography could be compiled of all the angry pamphlets and counter-pamphlets , tracts , remonstrances , lampoons and scurrilous parables published by doctors during this excitable century . Even the wiser men of medicine stooped to the incivilities of the lunatic fringe . Both Hunters quarrelled with the Monros of Edinburgh , and also quarelled with each other . When setting out to deflate an opponent it was customary to say how willingly one would have declined to notice his existence , but that his tactics , reflecting as they did on one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of honour than to attempt a reply . The way was then cleared for impugning the other man 's good faith , education , morals and degrees . A notable piece of medical Billingsgate is the following , from the pen of Dr John Brown , who was describing a theory of spasm ' put forward by Dr William Cullen : This brat , the feeble , half-vital , semi-production of frenzy , the starveling of strained systematic dullness , the forlorn outcast of the fostering care to which it owed its infect vitality , was now to be pampered by a crude and indigestible nutriture , collected from all the materials which had composed the several fabrications of former I19
