Scientists trying to understand human social relationships often experiment with the simpler relations of lower animals . A favorite study is the pecking order of poultry . In groups of chickens there is usually one dominant individual that bosses the others around and may peck them all , but not be pecked in return . Slightly lower than No. 1 is No. 2 , which gets pecked by No. 1 , but pecks all the rest . At the bottom of the social sequence is a bedraggled , disheartened creature that is pecked by all , but does not peck back . <P> Last week Psychologists Wendell I. Smith of Bucknell University and E. B. Hale of Pennsylvania State University told a Philadelphia meeting of the Eastern Psychological Association that pecking orders are not immutable . They can be changed by Smith and Hale . <P> Dividing twelve white Leghorn hens into three groups of four , Smith and Hale allowed the natural pecking orders to establish themselves . When each hen clearly understood its rank in society . Smith and Hale selected pairs of hens from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each pair , they attached wires from an electric-shock device . Then both were put in a pen with a single dish of grain . <P> Under such circumstances the high-ranking hen normally eats first , but either Smith or Hale was always lurking outside the pen , finger on the button . Whenever the No. 1 hen tried to eat or peck , it got an electric shock . It also got a shock when the low-ranking hen of the pair plucked up courage to peck it . After a short course of this treatment , the upper-class hens began to have serious doubts about their place in society . <P> Twelve treatments were enough . Smith and Hale reported that each group had its social order turned upside down . Its top hen became its bottom hen . In two out of three groups , the bottom hen rose to the top . In all groups , the upper middle-class hen-No. 2-clung most tenaciously to its position . The No. 25 needed twice as many shocks as the others to accept a new place in society .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
