The Searchers A Story by Susan Kuehn Drawings by Aaron Sopher T HERE was no trace of Danny . He had been lost six hours by then . Lights swung in the darkness as our search party found the way back along the trail we had cut in entering the woods . Mud , caked by water , made my feet so heavy that it was hard to lift them each time . I touched my face , expecting to find a growth of beard , but there was only dirt . All around , there was the green smell of water , of sweat and damp wool clothes and always the scent of the wet , decaying earth . We came on the clearing of my father 's farm suddenly to see it filled with people and alive with moving lights . When my sister June hurried toward us , her hair was mussed up , and the wet night air made it spring up around her face . " What did you find , Graden ? " she shouted . I had to tell her there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old when I was born , but now I felt like the oldest . " We 'll find him , " I said . " Do n't worry . " But it was like talking to a stone . She nodded , and some life came back into her face when she clutched at my arm . " You 're not going to give up ? You ca n't leave him alone in the woods at night . " " There must be fifty people out there now . They told us to turn back and get some rest . " " Graden , I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm half out of my mind , " she said . She looked around the crowded yard . " Where 's Kendall ? " ? she asked , hunting for her husband . " I do n't see him anywhere . " " He would n't turn back . He 's still out there . " I looked at the dirt-smeared faces of the other men in the half-brightness of flashlights and lanterns and saw that most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt my own face and took my hand away when I touched a gummy line at the jaw . A dot of caked blood lay in my palm . Everywhere in the woods , the branches had reached out to hold us back . Sometimes they held like rope around the waist , and we had to push hard to free ourselves , but there always would be the little , soft-looking ones that were the worst after all , because they clawed at our faces and clothes . Danny 's little light sweater would be chewed to pieces by those thorny green branches alone . He was only six years old . Women who lived near enough to make it had come , bringing food and coffee that we swallowed standing up that night , because the ground was cold , and there was n't anywhere else to sit . A truck moved into the yard , carrying army cots , and we learned we were supposed to sleep there . But I could n't sleep for blaming myself . Danny might have been here now if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family drove up from Chicago , I had helped Danny build a little house in our back yard . It was going to be a copy of our place , front porch and all , and when hestarted working on it , Danny forgot all about his toy model car collection . " You promised me you 'd help with the house , " he had said that morning . But I had to be a big shot because it was Saturday noon , and drive into Byron City in Kendall Jackson 's blue Buick Riviera for everyone to see . I had bought Danny a can of brown paint at the hardware store that morning , to make up for leaving him behind . I felt it still in my pocket when I rolled over on the cot . I opened my eyes to see June moving around the yard with the other women , pouring coffee and saying nothing . Inside the house , her little girl began to cry , and June hurried inside , coming back to stand in the doorway with Marcia in her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little girl asked . She stared at us . " When 's Danny going to come to bed ? " " Never mind . " June 's voice was flat . She looked like Dad then , with the bones sticking up through her skin , and her lipstick gone . " It 's not fair for him to stay up later than me . " But Marcia did n't complain when June took her back inside . j uNE had been shouting for Danny when Kendall Jackson and I drove back from Byron City . Dad had been watching him when he disappeared , but Danny had gone so quickly that there was no way of telling which direction to follow . Help had come fast . All afternoon a string of cars drove up the bumpy dirt road that led off the highway . Nap Stoner came with Sherman Blatnik , his deputy . Sherman had brought his two bloodhounds with him  --  queer , ugly dogs with big muscles and sagging faces . I suppose it was the first time Sherman Blatnik had seen June in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ask for something of Danny 's so he could give the scent to the bloodhounds . She brought out his pajamas . They were blue , with little figures of Mickey Mouse on them . The druggist , Everett Handler , and the Cranstons had come over right away , and in the middle of the afternoon , forest rangers and game wardens began to turn up . Just before it got dark , National Guardsmen came . As each group started out , Nap Stoner or Sherman Blatnik had given a pistol to the leader . When Danny was found , there would be four shots . I could hear Dad 's voice again as I lay on the cot . " This picture was taken in April , when Danny was in his school play , " he said . " He 's got real light curly hair . You 'll be able to see it against the trees . " His one good hand could n't hold the picture still . " I told him to find me a little piece of wood for his house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and you could tell by the way he said it that lie had gone through the story so many times that the words did n't have any certain meaning for him any longer . " I just turned my head not more than fifty , sixty seconds . " I could hear Marcia sobbing inside the house . " Was she outside with them when it happened ? " Nap Stoner asked . " She 's too young to understand . She never says the same thing twice , " June answered . I watched her high heels sink into the earth beneath the sparse grass . " She thinks it 's some kind of game . " " I just turned my head not more than fifty , sixty seconds , " Dad said . He sat in one spot , not moving except when he turned to peer into the black edge of woods . And he was listening . I could tell that . Then he stood up and wandered off to the left . " Where are you going ? " Nap Stoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he must have gone into the woods there . " " We 've looked there , " Nap told him . " The hounds did n't even get a scent . " " I was sure it was over there , " Dad said , walking back to his seat . I noticed then that it was a stuffed parlor chair he had brought out from the house and set on the ground . I could remember when Mother picked out the red slip-cover material , and it looked crazy to see that chair sitting there on the grass . I watched Everett Handler lie down on the cot next to mine . He was an ugly , good-natured man with scant , light eyebrows and lashes around his pale blue eyes , which gave the appearance of being all white . Before June had left for Chicago , she used to take me in town with her and buy me a coke at Everett 's drug store while she would leaf through the movie magazines . That was one thing you could say about Everett , that he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After June fin-ished paging over the pictures of the stars , she would hold her chin up and throw her hair back over her shoulders . She combed her hair a lot those days . What was it like for her , I wondered . When June married her boss in the Chicago insurance company , Dad and I had n't gone . Instead , we used the train tickets and clothes money to buy a silver tray . Dad asked her to visit us , and once it looked as if they were coming , but at the last minute they could n't make it after all . We did n't really believe they would come this time either until we actually saw them drive into the yard . Kendall Jackson had a little , trim mustache that reminded me of a movie star , but I could n't remember just who . And although June did n't go into town and say hello to people she knew , she seemed glad to be back . But there was one thing she did n't mention , and finally Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman Blatnik , " he had said that morning in the kitchen . She held a wet glass out in front of her . " How is he ? " she said . " He used to drop in and ask about you before you got married , " Dad told her . " He 's got a good farm and some hunting dogs . " I had watched her move back and forth from the cupboards . I liked the striped skirt and the high-heeled pumps she wore . " I 'm glad he 's doing well , " she had said . I lay on the cot , watching the sky and wishing I could fall asleep instead of thinking . When I saw the lights coming out of the trees , I thought maybe I had slept and turned the stars upside down in my mind so that they were on the earth instead of where they were supposed to be . But they were only more flashlights . It was funny , I thought , how everything had happened at once . Dad got crippled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , Danny had asked Dad why he could n't move his arm . June had told him not to ask such things , and it surprised me to see her face get so red . When someone touched me and said it was time to start out again , it was early morning . During the night , tents had been pitched across our property , and big food tables had been set up close to the house , where men now stood in a line waiting their turns . Nap Stoner was talking to some groups of men , new arrivals who had driven in that morning , and getting them ready to start into the swamp . Some of them I knew , and most of them I did n't . " I 've never seen so many men together like this except once , " Mr. Cranston said when we were waiting in the coffee line . " It was a posse for a killer . " w E STARTED out again . The balsam and cedars were far enough apart at the edge so you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tangle further in . The ground was springy and wet all the time , no matter how little rain we had , and a storm two years before had knocked brush and trees down over holes so you could fall down twenty feet if you slipped into one of them . Sometimes , if a dog got lost and did n't return , people believed that this place was where it went . I had gone in there once , daring myself , but the thick tangle of trees made me turn back . I had cut in only far enough to say I had been inside . Even though it was bright outside , the trees were dark and wild-looking . Shaggy and massed together , they had a coldness about them . You could smell them , the oldness and the stale , molding pull in the nostrils . Nowhere , even at our place , had there been a footstep of Danny 's to follow , and we did n't see any now except for our own , looking like blurred scars in the muddy earth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was moist inside the woods , and I put on the jacket I had tied around my waist . The land sloped downward toward a cedar bog . Danny had been wearing green overalls with a jersey of the same color , but MAGAZINE everything here was green  --  dark , pale , medium green . I hunted for a glimpse of his blond hair , and once I thought I saw it and shouted , but it turned out to be a clump of yellow leaves . A hole in my boot sole began to leak water until my right sock was wet through . I could n't remember what kind of shoes Danny had worn . All morning the woods were full of sound . Our group had Everett Handler , Joe Cranston , and his father in it . I did n't know the others by name . The men kept on shouting , but they stopped when they were too out of breath to keep on moving and call for Danny at the same time . I saw that Everett was getting winded already from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us to rest for a minute . Although he was pretty far ahead , I could hear him talking to Everett . " It 's funny it would come down to her depending on us , " he said . " That must be almost ten years ago , " Everett told him . " That does n't change it any , " said Mr. Cranston . We started out again . As I watched birds skim out of the trees and flutter against the leaves , I envied them because it would be so easy to fly and not fight through the wet , uneven ground as we had to do . A bee would buzz around my head , or a mosquito would sing in my ear so that it was a relief when it finally stung me and died with my slap . But the sound that I heard all the time was the noise of my own breathing . I kept wishing that I could put one foot down after the other and be sure I was stepping on something safe and level and certain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot a hundred yards away could look so comfortable , but it was just as full of briers as the rest of the land when we reached it . It was all a web of twigs that cut against our faces . I left my jacket hanging on a tree , because it was too heavy and caught too many thorns . Since it was red , I knew I could find it again . The ground broke away when I moved down a steep hill toward the creek in front of me . The grade was so sudden that my shoulder nearly touched the earth , and the wet , black dirt crumbled under my boots to roll into the ravine below . Then my feet , that had been so sure before , could n't keep up with the speed I was traveling , and I found myself roll-OEM imilmor ing too , but never as fast as the crumbling earth that slid and ran down the hill before me . I fell all the way , and my mouth was full of dirt when I stopped . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside me , I heard them drop and roll against the rocky edge of a hole I might have stepped into myself . When I looked down into the hole , I did n't find what I was looking for and yet afraid to see . He was n't there . It was easier to move down a hill than to go back up again . I could n't find anything to cling to . Small plants growing on the hillside pulled loose in my fingers as I grasped them . I walked in the creek , because there were fewer branches there to slap against my face and catch on my clothes . Finally , I found myself standing in water that reached only an inch below the top of my boots . I tried to climb the steep slope of brown earth , but it broke apart underneath my feet and sent me back again to the water with a splash . I stood in the creek again , watching water drip into the pool at my feet . There was no way of knowing how long I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how soon the water would rise above my boots . The sky was nearly hidden by the trees , and I had no watch . I did n't feel as if I had a bit of strength left . Sometime later , I saw a root embedded in the ground , the only thing I had n't noticed before , and I held it in my right hand and put my left behind me for leverage . The root held , then moved out of the ground . I held it with both hands for the last try , but it pulled loose and dangled from my fingers . When I got my breath back , I dug my hands into the ground , clawing it while I crawled up the hill . It worked . But when I went to get my jacket , it was gone . I wondered who could have taken it , because I had the right tree for sure . Did n't I ? I could n't remember , and I knew I , too , was lost . Terror came sudden and swift when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where was the opening ? How had I come into this place at all ? When I tried to part the thorny branches , they caught at my sweater and pants like barbed wire so I could n't move . They made holes in the cloth and worked their way past the material into my skin . As I clawed , searching for an opening , a branch snapped against my eyeball . For a long time , I was afraid to open my eye for fear it would fall out . The smell of molding ground was heavy around me . I looked down to see a fresh footprint in the wetness , but I realized almost right away that it was my own . I had made it only a few minutes before . " Danny ! " I yelled . I knew now how scared he must be , how tired and wet and scratched . " Danny ! " Far off , I could hear the shouts of the men . What if Danny , too , tried to shout at us and was caught somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to hear the marshy ground suck against my foot . It was n't safe to stay there . I yelled out for Danny once more and heard something come through the twigs and dry branches . They crackled like fire as they broke . It was Everett Handler , panting as he cut away the branches to free me . He had found my jacket . It had been only a couple of yards away all that time , and the men , too , were closer than I had thought . It took us only about fifteen minutes to get back to them . Because there was no place to sit down , they half-leaned against the birch trees surrounding us . The birches were n't strong enough to hold our weight , but the other trees had too many needles to be comfortable . A few of the men were smoking . " Do you remember the time the little girl got lost over near Pear River , and they found her just as good as new ? " asked Everett . He wiped his steaming face against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . W E CAME out of the woods for the second time on Sunday afternoon , to meet the faces of Dad and June . Their eyes were dark , made small by lack of sleep . Marcia knew what it was all about by then . " Danny ! " she called as she ran over to the edge of the woods . " Come back and finish your house . " June had to run after Marcia and catch her in her arms to keep the little girl away from the trees . " Danny , why do n't you answer ? " she shouted , trying to get away from June . " Mother , ca n't you make him talk to me ? " But most of the time , Marcia stayed close to the house and did n't complain when one of the other women watched over her to give June a rest . Jackson spent nearly all his time in the woods . When his group came in , he would join another , eating whatever food he could find to carry . The damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't go inside . That night I found him standing in the yard , looking at a mound of stones and wood . " Danny 's house , " he said . " He never got to finish it . Do you suppose he tried to build something out there ? " " It 's going to be all right , " I told him , and thought of the water holes inside that were deeper than a man is tall . " We 're going to find him . " " I should n't have asked her to come back at all , " Dad said . Word came on Monday night that one of Sherman Blatnik 's hounds had struck a fresh trail on the ground above the cedar bog . When Nap Stoner 's party came back with the news , June stepped forward as if she could n't quite believe it . Nothing would stop her from going out herself as we all started back toward the woods . " Why do n't you stay here ? " Kendall asked her . " If we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been here too long . I 've imagined myself out there so many times that 1 might as well be , " she answered , and there was no way for him to keep her back . She moved ahead as fast as anyone , although her feet kept slipping , and her breath came in jerks . 3 " You 're tired already , " he said . " No , " she said sharply . " Leave me alone . " " I 've done all I could , " he said . " I 've looked until it does n't seem possible he 's in there at all . He had his toys . Why did he go looking for a piece of wood ? " " He was building that house . Maybe he liked it because I used to live there . Is n't that a reason ? " " But he had his toys . I do n't understand it . " " You should n't keep asking that , " she said . " Maybe he 'll tell us himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't , " he told her , and the word was like a shout . " Do n't even hope until we know . " " You do n't think we 'll find him , do you ? " she asked . " We ca n't be sure until , " and he stopped for a second . " Until we get there and find out . " I walked behind them , swinging my flashlight off toward the trees . Everything seemed much stiller than it was by day . Kendall lit a cigarette , and the smoke curled up as if it were climbing the beam of light . I turned the flashlight on the ground . It was funny to see my own feet come out of the dark , as if they were n't part of me any longer . There were bonfires in the swamp , and you could see them shining through the trees . They were beacons for Danny and places where the men could warm themselves and dry their clothing . Guides and trappers were crisscrossing the ground when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I saw him . " The dog 's lame , but we 've got to hold to the scent while it 's warm , " he was saying . Then , in the swinging gleam of a flashlight , I had a glimpse of his cap and his dark face , made darker by a growth of whiskers . I watched June rush toward him , while Kendall walked over to Nap Stoner . Looking at her and Sherman Blatnik , I wondered if things might have been different if he could have done as much for her ten years ago as he ( lid now . " What have you found out ? " she asked . " Nothing yet , " and his voice was soft . I watched him take June over to the nearest bonfire to wait while the search went on . Then he came back to the dogs , and 1 could see her , huddling her hands into her sleeves as she stood with her back to the fire . Fi ACH minute could bring Danny or another sign , but the minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lame . Someone was sent back for fresh hounds , because Sherman refused to give up until another dog came to pick up the scent . But it was no use . The firsthound simply could n't go on , and when they came back with another , the trail had been lost . I think that was the time when June gave up hope . She left the fire and did n't look at anyone . She did n't seem to feel even Kendall 's arm holding her to keep her from stumbling . Once I saw her pull her arm away from his . It was a long , terribly quiet walk back . All through the woods , it smelled like decay . When they told Dad that the scent had faded , he was quiet , and I was afraid he was going to collapse . He gripped the stuffed arms of his parlor chair , just staring into those trees . I noticed he was trying to say something to June , but he could n't seem to get started . " I tell you it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't blame yourself , " June said in a strained voice . " I 've got to tell you , " he said . " I dozed off for a minute in the yard . That must be when he wandered off . " Something flickered up on her face to fade out there . " Asleep ? " " I was happy , I guess , " he said , as if he were apologizing . " It was nice out , and I was thinking that you were home again . And Danny was out there playing next to me . I just dropped off . " June 's face was all closed up so you could n't see anything in it . " I understand , " she said . More men kept on coming every hour . An airplane flew over the next day to help guide search parties through the densest part of the woods , although we probably did n't cover more than six square miles altogether . The mosquitoes got worse every time we went in . I thought of Danny 's thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what must be going through his mind was something I did n't want to think about , A photographer who had driven up from Minneapolis edged around , taking pictures . He got Dad to stand at the place in the yard where he had first missed Danny . Then he had June pose for him , and somebody brought Marcia out to be in the picture . At the entrance to the woods , the men 's feet had worn a heavy band of bootprints into the grass Dad and I had planted . The prints were ground into the earth , and they looked more like huge toothmarks than anything else . All day long in the woods , the sky had the same color . It appeared in scraps between patches of interlaced branches above our heads , always gray , although the gray had a glow behind it at noon . The brightness behind the sky went away as it got later . It was flat gray just before it turned dark . Old leaves of red and yellow had fallen into the mud where they seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been chewed . That night was bad , worse than usual , because a mist crept into the trees . And we were so tired by then that it did n't seem worth it to stand in line for food any more , and time passed steadily without any sharp moments . They were all alike . I was asleep when I heard the pistol shots . When I was on my feet , I heard them again , and the people rushing toward the wood made me certain that it had been no dream . But instead of four , they came two at a time . It was Jackson who suddenly got excited this time . " Did you hear it ? " he shouted at June , although she was beside him . " Yes , " she said . " I heard the shots . " But her voice did n't lift to his . Somewhere near the house , I heard the women start a hymn that was sung at the Lutheran church in Byron City . Men left their cots to dash off into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through me like a chill . Jackson was gone when I looked again for him . As I ran toward the balsam trees at the swamp opening , the shouts had died down , and there was only the women 's singing and another sound , the heavy breath of Everett Handler beside me . " I wonder why it was only two shots , " he said . " They add up to four , " I told him . " That 's the signal . " " But they were n't together . " We moved faster than we ever had , along a trail that had been cleared out by four days of men passing through . Before we had gone half a mile , lights came toward us , and I saw Mr. Cranston and Sherman Blatnik carrying Nap Stoner . " Nap fired those shots , " Mr. Cranston said . " Fell in a bog and maybe broke his leg . " " Go and tell her , " Sherman told me . " It was no signal . " D ANNY would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again as they trailed off into nothing . It was like looking for something lost inside the house that was there a minute ago , and finally searching places where you knew it could n't be . They brought in the dogs to rest . Their flews hung down so far it was a wonder their collars did n't choke them . By Wednesday , all the hounds were lame and could n't keep on . The National Guards started to leave , and when their leader said that Danny could n't still be alive , he said just what most had been thinking . Nap Stoner had sprained his ankle when he fell , so Sherman Blatnik took his place and said he would keep on going . The guard members went away because they had done their best while there was the most hope , and people from the resorts began to drift off , too . Once the feeling started to grow , there was no holding it back . As each group slipped away , Dad tried to make them see that Danny was big and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him alive . Finally , the Byron City group started leaving on Friday , not long after we heard Nap Stoner had pneumonia . They remembered searches for other children who were never found . Sherman Blatnik told June the men would give up the search by nightfall if they were n't any luckier than they had been up to then . There had n't been a sign  --  no discarded jersey or lost shoe fallen in the trailless woods . Although I expected June to speak she did n't but looked at Sherman and nodded . It was Dad , instead , who tried to argue with the men . , " Give it one more day , why do n't you ? " " There 's no use , " Joe Cranston 's father said . " He just wandered off in a minute . He could n't have gone so far that you could miss him , " Dad said . " I just looked away for a couple of seconds . " Dad did n't say any more after that . He just looked from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seemed to find , because he finally turned away and walked into the house . I 'll never forget how strange that red parlor chair looked then , standing alone on the bumpy ground . As he went in , I thought the sky grew darker , dim somehow . When he was gone , Jackson tried to keep the men going . " We ca n't stop now , " he said . " We 'll never know what happened to him if we do . I 've got money . " It was the first time he mentioned what we all took for granted . " It would n't do any good , " Everett Handler said when it seemed that no one at all would answer . " How can you spread any amount of money among so many men ? " " It can be done , " Jackson said , but June stopped him . " No , " she said , " they do n't ask for pay . " Then she looked straight at us , and in spite of the men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , they could n't say she was n't strong . " It has to be stopped sometime . You can leave now . It wo n't help to stay for nightfall . " I looked at her and expected her to scream out , and I finally wished she would let go , but her face was tight . Most of them turned for home then . " I 've got to get back , " Everett said in his gentle voice . " My wife ca n't handle the drug store alone . " His big face was splotchy , and I suppose the week had been harder on him than he ever let on . Four men stayed . Besides myself , there were Jackson , the newspaper photographer , and Sherman Blatnik . I never thought of stopping . I was afraid to , because then I 'd imagine how different things would have been if I had n't gone into town in that fancy Buick . And I had thought I could make it up to him with a little can of brown paint . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish up his job , and the other wanted to show that he was n't holding what had happened almost ten years ago against anyone . And there was Jackson , who would keep on going as long as he could . But I wondered if the men who were n't with us any longer had n't been the best of the group . They had stayed all that time , although few of them had ever seen Danny , and though some blamed June for leaving their town . The sky , drab all day , seemed to draw into itself as we walked toward the woods for the last time . Suddenly something clamp was cold against my face , and it was snowing . Hopelessly , we stood and watched the loose , filmy mass come down , sparse at first and then quickening until it spun at us with fran-tic force . It hung to the shoulders of our coats and began to cover the ground . " That means it 's freezing , " Jackson said in a dead voice . " We might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky turned dark . As I watched Sherman Blatnik and the photographer drive off , the snow slanted down against the road . Nobody was in the yard any more , not even the chair was left . Jackson went in , and I watched the lights turn on inside our house . He and Dad sat across the room from each other . I saw June touch Dad 's shoulder , and she tried to smile . I went in then , and at the doorway I took off my cap and shook it to get off the snow . Some of the flakes had melted already , and I watched one cling to the damp wool , stretch out and hang there before it fell to the floor . That was what losing hope looked like .
