txt American steelmasters who visited Soviet and Polish fowl , dries and mills last year , and now have published their findings , weie impressed by the intensity of production , the up-todate methods , and Soviet conviction that the large-scale devlopment of their heavy industries . was made only by their state-socialist system . " As the Soviets sell steel , they also sell communism , " Russian speaking Dr. Dennis J. Carney , division superintendent of steel production at Duquesne , Pa. , is quoted in the April 1 issue of the U.S. Steel News . Dr. Carney visited not only technical ' colleges and laboratories but also the Soviet Union 's largest steel mill at Magnitogorsk in the Urals which is similar to our Gary Steel Works . There he had an opportunity to speak with Soviet citizens from . all walks of life . What he found was so interesting that the State Department , in negotiating this year 's visit to the Soviet Union by American steel experts , insisted that Magnitogorsk and other eastern steel mills be included in the Itinerary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel production throughout the Communist bloc add to the significance of what Dr. Carney and his colleagues have found fit to say . According to the latest statistics of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe , satellite steel output last year exceeded 16,000,000 metric . tons  --  approximately the amount of steel Germany produced on the eve of World War II . This was achieved despite the fact that Hungary 's steel production is still 4 per cent off the 1956 average . Poland , Czechoslovakia , East Germany , and Romania reported increases of 6 , 7 , 6 and 9 per cent respectively . In the first three months of this year Poland 's steel output has risen by another 4 per cent . This year 's total production is to be 5,600,000 metric tons as compared to 5,300,000 tons in 1957 . The recent Polish-Soviet agreement on mutual deliveries anticipates an output of 8,500,000 tons of steel in 1965 ? an increase of 60 per cent in seven years . Czechs Build Again Czechoslovakia , which has almost caught up with Poland , announced on April 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Kosice in Slovakia will be resumed . This so-called HUKO combine with a projected pig iron capacity of 1,000,000 tons was " temporarily " abandoned in 1953 . The Soviets themselves have made similar progress . Thanks to the commissioning toward the end of December of two new blast furnaces , steel production in the first quarter of the year increased at a rate of 7 per cent as compared to an average rate of 5 per cent for the past year and a rate of growth of 4 per cent in the first half of 1957 . Seven more powerful blast furnaces are to be commissioned in 1958 . Investments allocated to the iron and steel industry will be 27 per cent higher than in 1957 . " The Soviet is ahead of the United States in blast furnace production , " remarked U.S. Steel 's Dr. Carney in his report on Magnitogorsk . Thanks to " a meticulous ore handling program ( sintering ) , to modern equipment and operating techniques , smelting time at Magnitogorsk is shorter and tonnage output measurably higher than in American furnaces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities to provide a 100 per cent sintered charge to the blast furnaces . " Savings Recorded According to competent American technologists , 100 per cent sintering represents a saving in coal of about 15 per cent and an increase in iron production of about 10 per cent . Magnitogorsk 's " large open-hearth furnaces , with more equipment and manpower than are used in the United States , are equaling our best production rates . " " Soviet rolling and finishing techniques are inferior to ours , but . .. proposed expansion is designed to solve these problems to some degree . " The Soviet steel industry 's four principal advantages are , according to Dr. Carney : 1 . A more favorable location of raw materials . At Magnitogorsk with an output last year of 6,600,000 short tons of steel , Taw material , except basic brick and coal , is located within 200 miles . In this country ore has to be shipped over much larger distances . More Workers Used 2 . Profit-making is not a major item . Investment capital is forthcoming freely not only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets built , mainly for experimentation purposes , a **32;793;TOOLONG fully integrated steel mill in Tula , southwest of Moscow . 3 . Work forces arc much larger . Especially for maintenance the Soviets employ a far greater number of personnel than American mills . " Today the ratio of Soviet auxiliary workers to ours is about four to one . " Financially this is a burden , but one which the Soviet system does not find too hard to carry . What from an American point of view would be characterized as overstaffing , may well turn out to be what the Soviets call a . productivity reserve . 4 . Perhaps the most important advantage in Dr. Carney 's opinion is the sense of progress and dedication which the Soviets seem to have instilled in their personnel . Dr. Carney was so impressed by it that he remarked : " Unless we are able to sell capitalism with every ton of steel as the Soviets ; : ell communism , we 're losing the battle .
