 | Three of us happened to meet downtown and went into the drugstore for a midmorning cup of coffee . " Where are you going on your vacation this summer ? " one of them asked me . " We 're going to do ' the Southwest . The children are so cowboy-and-Indian crazy , we thought they 'd like to see the real thing . And I hope to do some painting . What about you ? " " Not as ambitious as you ! We plan to drift through Maryland and Virginia and look for antiques along the way . " We turned to the third member of our group . " You 're going to be amazed , " she said . " Everyone in the family had different projects planned for this summer , none BY CHARLOTTE MONTGOMERY of which included a trip , so I answered an ad in the paper for a passenger to share driving . I 'm leaving next week for Utah , with a high-school teacher . It just would n't seem like summer to me unless I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving more relaxing and renewing than anything else . " The automobile has opened up the endless wonders of our country to the American vacationist . More than eighty percent of the family holidays taken this year will be in the form of automobile trips , and everyone should come home from such a vacation with a broader outlook . Seeing the rocky farms of Vermont and Maine helps us understand the New England temperament ; the expression " the great open spaces " means more to us when we have crossed them , in the shadow of those who trekked  | covered wagons . Just the sight h open , unoccupied land gives ing to the belief that our coun ' . y begun to realize its potential at . er what point of the compass there are things you should e this a really happy holiday . sugh at a cartoon of a woman hundred miles from home and ers if she turned off the flame teakettle , but any nagging spoil a whole trip . I am going u three check lists to go over z leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and things that must be attended ur car . At least ten days before drive to your service station TOUT mechanic your vacation will give him time to schedule ? d repairs . These should be ) re you leave , because your knows your driving habits and nd his work probably will cost m emergency job on the road . ke a date to leave the car at station for a thorough goingmechanic undoubtedly knows to do ; however , here is a list nat should not be overlooked . an long and technical , but ach item ( and many more ) is an experienced mechanic . has to be taken care of at a year . It will give you a security , and assure a safe , e journey , if you have all of Ided to before your trip . ion : Regular grease job if you mn 1,000 miles since your car greased . Check lubrication of ( this should be replaced after ; ) . ange oil if you have driven since it was last put in . ReLiter after 8,000 miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be switched every to even wear . Your best tires on the front . Check wheel System : Check radiator , fan pump and connections , ther:an outside of radiator . System : Clean , tighten , and Irk-plug terminals and cables , points , small lead wires . Reif necessary . Check generator , nser , voltage regulator . You can see for yourself if 0o much play on the brake hould not go closer than two the floor . Check fluid level , drums . Reline if necessary . ' ety : Report any difficulties d with steering wheel , lights , shield wipers , door locks . before you leave , make anto the service station . This the gas tank filled , the oil ! d , water put in the battery for if necessary , and the air the tires , including the spare , Correct air pressure is imverinflated tires have less grip , d ; therefore , your motor must er to spin the wheels , and conuses more gasoline . Underin- flation is a major cause of tire wear . Find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by checking the booklet that came with your car . On your trip , have your tires checked regularly , asking specifically for the correct pressure . Do this when they are cool , as heat builds up pressure . My second check list is of the things to have in your car ? in the trunk and glove compartment . But first give both a good cleaning with a whisk broom . From the trunk , remove chains , bag of sand , and any other leftovers from winter preparations . From the glove compartment , remove ice scraper , wool gloves , old maps . Replace them with sunglasses , first-aid kit , bug repellent , flashlight , paper handkerchiefs and cups , notebook and pencil , new maps , scarf , cleaning fluid , compass , sewing kit . In the trunk , have a jack , a board ( to provide a firm base for the jack ) , a tool kit , a light with an extension cord , and some rags . Decide on the best place to carry your car registration and licenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MY THIRD check list is of things to do at home , so that you can travel with peace of mind . Select those that apply to you . Stop regular deliveries , such as milk , bread , paper . Leave house plants with a neighbor ; arrange for necessary watering and cutting of your lawn . Make arrangements for your pets . If you wish , you may turn off water , gas heater , and electricity ( at the main switch ) . Arrange to have your mail either held or forwarded . Notify the police of your departure and return dates . Leave a key , and an address where you can be reached , with a neighbor . Either empty and defrost your refrigerator and leave the door ajar , or use up perishable and frozen foods and set the control at low ? midway between normal and defrost . Just before you drive away , check lights , windows , door locks , faucets ? and look for anything left behind . A friend of mine , swinging out of her driveway to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final backward look and saw her clothesline flapping with a whole load of clean clothes she had intended to pack . I would advise any woman to turn most of the money she will need into traveler 's checks . These are available at all banks . They cost seventy-five cents for every hundred dollars ' worth , and can be cashed anywhere . A credit card from your favorite gasoline company also enables you to carry less cash , and acts as a record of gas and oil purchases . You charge these along the way , and they are billed monthly , on one statement . In addition to your car insurance , which should be adequate ( and paid up ! ) , consider a floater policy to cover your luggage . I find this an inexpensive worrysaver . If someone told you you were going to sit in the same small room , in the same chair , for eight hours or so a day for the next two weeks , would n't you try to make that chair as comfortable as possible ? Of course you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your car manufacturer has done much for you ? with springs , shock absorbers , arrangements for ventilation ? but there are also things for you to think of . One is proper seat adjustment and a pillow for your back . To drive without fatigue , you should sit up straight and be able to see without straining or peering . Never slouch . Sit directly behind the wheel and hold it firmly , but not so hard that you tense your muscles . The car is n't going to run away if you do n't hold it back ! If there 's an armrest on your left , use it occasionally . ' Another , on the right , makes for relaxing changes of position . One armrest , which costs about three dollars , tucks in the seat and has an upright metal arm and a foam-rubber cushion . Another type hooks over the back of the seat . METAL sun shields mounted outside METAL car have been on the market for about five years . We see more and more of them , proving that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the glare from the sky , thus lessening strain and fatigue . Though you will still need sunglasses , a sun shield will be appreciated on a blazingly sunny day . In hot weather , it also lowers the temperature inside the car by about ten degrees . Also on the market are side shields to go over doors , and little airand-rain deflectors that fit on the front " flipper " windows . Either of these permit having a window open when it 's raining ; the deflectors also keep your hair from blowing , by diverting the wind onto your feet . A sheet of smoky plastic can be mounted on the windshield ; it serves the same purpose as dark glasses when you drive directly into the sun . You 'll find that keeping your windshield clean makes a big difference in ease of vision . Stops for food and rest play an important part in the pleasure of your trip . Accommodations and cooking vary so greatly in the same locality , as well as from place to place , that the subject deserves more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides ( available at your bookstore or library ) ; if you belong to the American Automobile Association , carry their lists of recommendations . A number of cars outside a restaurant usually is a good sign ; so are trucks outside lunch wagons , which often offer excellent plain cooking and speedy service . Eating places with fresh-looking advertisements on the outskirts of a city usually are up-and-coming , or ask someone in a town for the best place to eat . Restaurant chains are under a certain amount of supervision , though much depends on local management . Do n't stop too late if you want a regular dinner ; small towns eat early ? at noon and six . As for overnight stops , if your trip is in season , you will find all the popular resorts crowded . If you want to stay at a resort hotel , or in a cabin , tent , or hotel in one of the national parks , you must make advance reservations . This also applies to getting you and your car on overnight boats . If it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a day away , to avoid disappointment . When hotels are full , you can often get accommodations at a nearby motel or tourist home . Stop early , so that you can look around : it 's quite proper to ask to inspect the quarters offered . Note cleanliness , bathroom facilities , screening , 149 @#  | etc . Motels are usually better than small-town hotels . Try to pick one , or tourist home , away from the main high way . One of the worst nights I ever sper on the road was in what seemed like quiet old homestead in a small Souther village . Heavy trucks roared by all nigh grinding into low gear just outside on window , at the foot of a hill that ha looked so charming by day . Some big-city hotels do much to make the tourist 's stay pleasant . They park an service your car , arrange trips , provide box lunches , secure tickets to theatre and sporting events , and finally send yo off with maps , road information , and , you wish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoi rule , so have the gasoline tank filled eac evening , and always have the radiato battery , and oil level checked . Make habit of asking whoever mans the g : pump about road conditions you a : likely to meet the next day . On-the-spc information may save you time and ar noyance . Have the oil changed and ticar greased after 1,000 to 1,500 mile do n't wait until the end of your trip . Finally , obey the laws , watch ro. signs , drive sanely and thoughtfully . An do n't forget to reduce your speed whe driving through small towns . Do n't dris too far any one day , and get out ar stretch every hundred miles . Have wonderful time ? and I 'd be grateful you 'd send me a post card somewhe : along the way .
