Part II of a Novel in Three Parts by ALDOUS HUXLEY THE GENIUS AND THE GODDESS To the public at large Doctor Henry Maartens was a brilliant scientist , a Nobel Prize winner and figure of world-wide consequence . But to his family he was a very different creature  --  and in the eyes of his young physics assistant , Rivers , who lived with them , he seemed close at times to being a monster . He was certainly an obsessed man ; and so , in her way , in spite of her beauty and outer serenity , was his wife , Katy . The resulting tensions had their effects on all the members of the family , ' especially the daughter , Ruth , a romantic young poet in love with Rivers . As this installment begins , Dr. Maartens has just come out of his bedroom to announce that his wife , in whose absence he is only half alive , has telephoned that she is unable to come home from the city where she is taking care of her dying mother . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened by Rivers , who is now a. grandfather , but was then a prudish young man brought up by a widowed mother . Rivers is speaking . II F U L L OF concern , I followed Henry . There was a short passage , I remember , with the door of a bathroom at the end of it and another door on the left , opening into the master bedroom . I had never been in the room before , and it was with a shock of surprise and wonder that I now found myself confronted by the Maartenses ' extraordinary bed . It was an Early American fourposter , but of such gigantic proportions that it made me think of Presidential assassinations and state funerals . In Henry 's mind , of course , the association of ideas must have been somewhat different . My catafalque was his marriage bed . The telephone , which had Copyright 1955 by Aldous Huxley just condemned him to another term of solitude , stood next to the symbol and scene of his conjugal happiness . No , that 's the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' implies a reciprocal relationship between two full-blown persons . But for Henry , Katy was n't a person ; she was his food , she was a vital organ of his own body . When she was absent , he was like a man with jaundice struggling to exist without a liver . It was an agony . " ' Maybe you 'd better lie down fur a while , ' I said in the wheedling tone one automatically adopts when speaking to the sick . I made a gesture in the direction of the bed . His response , this time , was like what happens if you sneeze while traversing a slope of newly fallen snow  --  an avalanche . And what an avalanche ? Not the white , virginal variety , but a hot , palpitating dung-slide . It stank , it suffocated , it overwhelmed . From the fool 's paradise of my belated and utterly inexcusable innocence , I listened in shocked , astonished horror . ' It 's obvious , ' he kept repeating . ' It 's only too obvious . ' Obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she did n't want to come home . Obvious that she must have found some other man . And obvious that this other man was the new doctor . Doctors were notoriously good lovers . They understood physiology ; they knew all about the autonomic nervous system . " Horror gave place in my mind to indignation . What was he daring to say about my Katy , about this more than woman who could only be as pure and perfect as my own almost religious passion ? Are you seriously implying , ' I began . . . . But Henry was n't implying . He was categorically affirming . Katy was being unfaithful to him with the young squirt from Johns Hopkins . " I told him he was mad , and he retorted that I knew nothing about sex . Which , of course , was painfully true . I tried to change the subject . It was n't a question of sex  --  it was a question of nephritis , of a mother who needed her daughter 's care . But Henry would n't listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ask why he wanted to torture himself , I can only answer that it was because he was already in agony . His was the weaker , the more dependent half of a symbiotic partnership which ( so he believed ) had just been dissolved abruptly . It was a surgical operation , without anesthetics . Katy 's return would have stopped the pain and instantly healed the wound . But Katy was not returning . Therefore ( admire the logic ! ) it was necessary for Henry to inflict upon himself as much additional suffering as he possibly could . And the most effective way of doing that was to put his misery into lacerating words . To talk and talk  --  not , of course , to me , not even at me ; only to himself  --  hut to himself ( and this was essential if he was to suffer ) in my presence . T II E PAR T assigned to me was not that of the supporting character actor , not even that of the bit player who serves as confidant and errand runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faceless extra , whose business it had been to provide the hero with his initial excuse for thinking out loud , and who now , by simply being on the spot , imparted to the overheard soliloquy a monstrousness , a sheer obscenity , which it would have lacked if the speaker had been alone . Self-activated , the dung-slide gathered momentum . From Katy 's betrayal , he passed to her chcipice ( and this was the unkindest cut ) of a younger man . Younger and therefore more virile , more indefatigably lustful ( not to mention all that , as a doctor , he knew about physiology and the autonomic nervous system ) . The person , the professional , the devoted healer  --  all had disappeared ; and so by implication had Katy . Nothing remained except a pair of sexual functions frantically exploiting one another in the void . " That he could have thought in these terms about Katy and her hypothetical lover was a proof , as I began obscurely to realize , that he thought in the same way about Katy and himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken reed , and broken reeds , as you must have had innumerable occasions to observe , are apt to be ardent . Ardent , indeed , to the point of frenzy . No , that 's the wrong word . Frenzy is blind . Whereas lovers like Henry never lose their head . They take it with them , however far they go  --  take it with them so that they can be fully , gloatingly conscious of their own and their partners ' alienation . Actually , this was about the only thing , outside his laboratory and his library , that Henry cared to be conscious of . Most people inhabit a universe that is like French cafe au laic-50 per cent skim milk and 50 per cent stale chicory , half MAGAZINE psychophysical reality and half conventional verbiage . " Henry 's universe was modeled on the highball . It was a mixture in which half a pint of the fizziest philosophical and scientific ideas all but drowned a small jigger of immediate experience , most of it strictly sexual . Broken reeds are seldom good mixers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sensuality and their psychosomatic complaints to be able to take an interest in other people  --  even their own wives and children . They live in a state of the most profound voluntary ignorance , not knowing anything about anybody , but abounding in preconceived opinions about everything . " Take the education of children , for example . Henry could talk about it as an authority . He had read Piaget , he had read Dewey , he had read Montessori , he had read the psychoanalysts . It was all there in his cerebral filing cabinet , classified , categorized , instantly available . But when it came to doing something for Ruth and Timmy , he was either hopelessly incompetent or , more often , he just faded out of the picture . For of course they bored him . All children bored him . So did the overwhelming majority of adults . how could it he otherwise ? Their ideas were rudimentary and their reading , nonexistent . What had they to offer ? Only their sentiments and their moral life , only their occasional wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word , only their humanity . And humanity was something in which poor Henry was incapable , congenitally , of taking an interest Between the worlds of quantum theory and epistemology at one end of the spectrum and of sex and pain at the other , there was a kind of limbo peopled only by ghosts . And among the ghosts was about 75 per cent of himself . For he was as little aware of his own humanity as of other people 's . His ideas and his sensations  --  yes , he knew all about those . But who was the man who had the ideas and felt the sensations ? And how was this man related to the things and people around him ? How , above all , ought he to be related to them ? I doubt if it ever occurred to Henry to ask himself such questions . In any case he did n't ask them on this occasion . His soliloquy was not a husband 's agonized debate between love and suspicion . That would have been a fully human response to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , it could never occur in the presence of a listener so raw and foolish , so incapable of giving understanding help , as was the young john Rivers of thirty years ago . No , this was essentially a less than human reaction ; and one of the elements of its subhumanity was the fact , the utterly outrageous and senseless fact , that it was taking place in the presence of someone who was neither an inti-mate friend nor a professional counselor  --  merely a shocked young bumpkin with a too pious background and a pair of receptive but shuddering ears . ? " Those poor ears ! Lucidly expressed and richly documented , the scientific dirt fairly poured into them . Burton and Havelock Ellis , Krafft-Ebing and the . incomparable Ploss and Bartels  --  like Piaget and John Dewey , they were all there in Henry 's built-in filing cabinet , accessible in the minutest detail . And in this case , it now became evident , Henry had not been content to remain the armchair expert . He had practiced what he preached ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory . How difficult it is , in these days when you can discuss orgasms over the soup and flagellation with the ice cream. , how extraordinarily difficult it is to remember the strength of the old taboos , the depth of the silence by which they were surrounded . " As far as I was concerned , everything that Henry talked about  --  the techniques of lovemaking , the anthropology of marriage , the statistics of sexual satisfaction  --  was a revelation from the abyss . It was the sort of thing that decent people did not mention , did not , I had fondly imagined , even know ; the sort of thing that could be discussed and understood only in brothels , at rich men 's orgies , in Montmartre and Chinatown and the French Quarter , And yet these horrors were being poured into my ears by the man whom I respected above all others , the man who , for intellect and scientific intuition , surpassed everyone I had ever known . " And he was uttering his horrors in connection with the woman whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura . He was asserting , as though it were the most obvious thing in the world , that Beatrice had almost insatiable appetites , that Laura had broken her marriage vows for the sake of the kind of physical sensations which any hefty brute with a good knowledge of the autonomic nervous system could so easily evoke . And even if he had n't been accusing Katy of unfaithfulness , I should have been appalled by what he said . For what he said implied that the horrors were as much a part of marriage as of adultery . CAN HARDLY expect you to believe it , " Rivers added with a laugh , " but it 's the truth . Up to that moment I had no idea of what went on between husbands and wives . Or rather I had an idea , but it did n't happen to be correct . My idea was that , outside the underworld , decent people did n't make love except for the sake of having children  --  once in a lifetime in my parents ' case , twice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge ofhis catafalque and soliloquizing . Soliloquizing with the lucidity of genius , the uninhibited elaboration of infantility , about all the strange and , to me , appalling immoral things that /tau happened under its funereal canopy . And Katy , my Katy , had been his accomplice  --  not his victim , as at first I had tried to believe , but his willing and even enthusiastic accomplice . It was this enthusiasm , indeed , that made him suspect her . For if sensuality meant so much to her here , on the domestic catafalque , it must of necessity mean more to her up there in Chicago , with the young doctor . And suddenly , to my unspeakable embarrassment , Henry covered his face and began to sob . " There was a silence . " What did you do ? " I asked . " What could I do ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " Nothing , except make a few soothing noises and advise him to go to bed . Tomorrow he 'd discover that it had all been a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hot milk , I hurried off to the kitchen . Beulah was in her rocking chair , reading a small hook about the Second Coming . I told her that Dr. Maartens was n't feeling so good . She listened , nodded meaningfully as though she had expected it , then shut her eyes and , in silence , but with moving lips , prayed for a long time . After that she gave a sigh and said , ' Empty , swept , and garnished . ' Those were the words that had been given to her . And though it seemed an odd thing to say about a man who had more in his head than any six ordinary intellectuals , the phrase turned out , on second thought , to be an exact description of poor old Henry . Empty of God , swept clean of common manhood , and garnished like a Christmas tree with glittering notions . And seven other devils , worse even than stupidity and sentimentality , had moved in and taken possession . B UT MEANWHILE the milk was steaming . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , as I entered the bedroom , f thought Henry had given me the slip . Then , from behind the catafalque , came a sound of movement . In the recess behind the draped chintz of the four-poster and the window , Henry was standing before the open door of a small safe , let into the wall and ordinarily concealed from view by the half-length portrait of Katy in her wedding dress , which covered it . " ' Here 's your milk , ' I began in a tone of hypocritical cheerfulness . But then I noticed that the thing he had taken out of the recesses of the strongbox was a revolver ; my heart missed a heat . T remembered suddenly that there was a midnight train for Chicago . Visions of the day after tomorrow 's headlines crowded in on inc . FAMOUS SCIENTIST SHOOTS WIFE , SELF . Or , alternately , NOBEL PRIZE . MAN HELD IN DOUBLE SLAYING . Or even MOTHER OF TWO DIES IN FLAMING LOVE NEST . " 1 put down the thermos and , bracing myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jaw , or a short sharp jab in the solar plexus , I walked over to him . If you do n't mind , Mr. Maartens , ' I said respectfully . There was no struggle , hardly so much as a conscious effort on his part to keep the revolver . Five seconds later the thing was safely in my pocket . ' I was just looking at it , ' he said in a small flat voice . And then , after a little pause , he added , ' It 's a funny thing , when you think of it . ' And when I asked , ' What ? ' he said , ' Death . ' And that was the full extent of the great man 's contribution to the sum of human wisdom . Death was a funny thing when you thought of it . That was why he never thought of it  --  except on occasions like the present , when suffering had made him feel the need for the self-infliction of more suffering . Murder ? Suicide ? The ideas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instrument of death was a sensation of negative sensuality  --  a painful reminder , in the midst of all his other pains , that someday , a long long time hence , he too would have to die . " ' Can we shut this up again ? ' I asked . He nodded . On a little table beside the bed lay the objects he had taken out of the safe while looking for the revolver . These I now replaced  --  Katy 's jewel box , half-a-dozen cases containing the gold medals presented to the great man by various learned societies , several Manila envelopes bulging with papers . And finally there were those books  --  all six volumes of the Studies in the Psychology of Sex , a copy of Felicia by Andrea de Nerciat. and , published in Brussels , an anonymous work with illustrations , entitled Miss Floggy 's Finishing School . ' Well , that 's that , ' I said in my jolliest bedside manner as I locked the safe door and returned him the key . Picking up the portrait I hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin and the orange blossom , behind the Madonna lilies and a face whose radiance even the ineptitude of a fifth-rate painter could not obscure , who could have divined the presence of that strangely assorted treasure  --  Felicia and the stock certificates , Miss Floggy and the golden symbols with which a not very grateful society rewards its men of genius ? " Half an hour later I left him and went to my room  --  with what a blessed sense of having escaped , of being free at last from an oppressive nightmare ! But even in my room there was no security . The first thing I saw , when I switched on the light , was an envelope pinned to my pillow . I opened it and unfolded two sheets ofmauve paper . It was a love poem from Ruth . This time yearning rhymed with spurning . Love confessed had caused the beloved to detest her something or other breast . It was too much for one evening . Genius kept pornography in the safe ; Beatrice had been to school at Miss Floggy 's ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men , and , if I did n't lock my door , would soon be yearning and burning its way out of bad literature into worse reality . T HE NEXT morning I overslept and , when 1 came down to breakfast , the children were already halfway through their cereal . Your mother is n't coming home , after all , ' I announced . Timmy was genuinely sorry ; but though she uttered appropriate words of regret , the sudden brightening of Ruth 's eyes betrayed her ; she was delighted . Anger made me cruel . I took her poem out of my pocket and laid it on the tablecloth beside the Grapenuts . ' It 's lousy , ' I said brutally . Then without looking at her I left the room and went upstairs again to see what had happened to Henry . He had a lecture at nine-thirty and would be late unless I routed him out of bed . But when I knocked at his door a feeble voice announced that he was ill . I went in . On the catafalque lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his temperature . It was over a hundred and one . What was to be done ? " I ran downstairs to the kitchen to consult with Beulah . The old woman sighed and shook her head . You 'll see , ' she said . ' He 'll make her come home . ' And she told me the story of what had happened , two years before , when Katy went to France to visit her brother 's grave in one of the war cemeteries . She had hardly been gone a month when Henry took sick  --  so sick that they had to send a cable summoning her home . Nine days later , when Katy got back to St. Louis , he was all but dead . She entered the sick room , she laid a hand on his forehead . ' I tell you , ' said Beulah dramatically , ' it was just like the raising of Lazarus . Down to the doors of death and then , whoosh ! all the way up again , like he was in an elevator . Three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . And he 'll do the same this time . He 'll make her come home , even if it means going to death 's door to get what he wants . ' And that , " Rivers added , " was precisely where he went  --  to death 's door . " " You mean it was genuine ? He was n't putting on art act ? " " As if the second alternative excluded the first ! Of course he was putting on an act ; but he put it on so successfully that he very nearly died of pneumonia . However , that was something I did n't clearly recognize at the time . In that respect Beulah was a great deal more scientific in her approach than 1 . 1 had the exclusive superstition of germs ; she believed in psychosomatic medicine . Well , I telephoned the doctor and then went back to the dining room . The children had finished their breakfast and were gone . " I did n't see them again for the best part of two weeks ; for when 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Beulah had packed them off , on the doctor 's advice , to stay with a friendly neighbor . No more poems , no further need to lock my door . It was a great relief . I phoned to Katy on Monday night and again , with the news that we had had to engage a nurse and hire an oxygen tent , on Tuesday . Next day Henry was worse ; but so , when I telephoned to Chicago , was poor Mrs. Hanbury . ' 1 ca n't leave her , ' Katy kept repeating in an anguish . ' I ca n't ! ' To Henry , who had been counting on her return , the news was almost mortal . Within two hours his temperature had risen a whole degree and he was delirious . ' It 's his life or Mrs. Hanbory 's , ' said Beulah , and she went to her room to pray for guidance . " In about twenty-five minutes it came . Mrs. Hanbury was going w die whatever happened ; but Henry would be all right if Katy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the doctor wl-M finally persuaded her , ' I do n't want to be an alarmist , ' he said over the phone that evening , ' but . . ' That did it . be home by tomorrow night , ' she said . Henry was going to get his way  --  but only just in time . HI DOCTOR left . The nurse settled down to a night of watching . I went to my room . ' Katy will be back tomorrow , ' I said to myself . ' Katy will be back tomorrow . ' But which Katy  --  mine or Henry 's , Beatrice or Miss Floggy 's favorite pupil ? Would everything , I wondered , be different now ? Would it be possible , after the dung-slide , to feel for her as I had felt before ? All that night and the next day the questions tormented me . I was still asking them when , at long last , I heard the taxi turning into the driveway . My Katy or his ? A horrible foreboding sickened and paralyzed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to go and meet her . When at last I opened the front door , the luggage was already on the steps and Katy was paying off the driver . She turned her head . " How pale she looked in the light of the porch lamp , how drawn and haggard ! But how beautiful ! More beautiful than ever  --  beautiful in a new , heart-rending way , so that I found myself loving her with a passion from which the last traces of impurity had been dissolved by pity and replaced by an ardor of self-sacrifice , a burning desire to help and protect , to lay down life itself in her service . And what about Henry 's soliloquy and the other Katy ? What about Miss Floggy and Felicia and the Studies in the Psychology of Sexy So far as my suddenly leaping heart was concerned , they had never existed , or at any rate were totally irrelevant . " As we entered the hall , Beulah came running out of the kitchen . Katy threw her arms round the old woman 's neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a silent embrace . Then , drawing hack a little , Beulah looked up searchingly into the other 's face . And as she looked , the expression of tear-stained rapture gave place to one of deepening anxiety . ' But it is n't you , ' she cried . ' It 's the ghost of you . You 're almost as far gone as he is . ' Katy tried to laugh it off . She was just a bit tired , that was all . The old woman emphatically shook her head . ' It 's the virtue , ' she said . ' The virtue 's gone out of you . Like it went out of our dear Lord when all those sick people kept grabbing hold of him . ' ' Nonsense , ' said Katy . " But it was quite true . The virtue had gone out of her . Three weeks at her mother 's bedside had drained her of life . She was empty , a shell animated only by the will . And the will is never enough . The will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your temperature  --  much less somebody else 's temperature . ' Wait till tomorrow , ' Beulah begged , when Katy announced her intention of going tip to the sickroom . ' Get some sleep . You ca n't help him now , not in the state you 're in . ' ' I helped him last time , ' Katy retorted . ' But last time was different , ' the old woman insisted . ' Last time you had the virtue ; you were n't a ghost . ' ' You and your ghosts ! ' said Katy with a touch of annoyance ; and , turning , she started up the stairs . I followed her . " " Under his oxygen tent Henry was asleep or in a stupor . A gray stubble covered his chin and cheeks , and in the emaciated face the nose was enormous , like something in a caricature . Then , as we looked at him , the eyelids opened . Katy bent over the transparent window of the tent and called his name . There was no response , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , or even that he had seen her . ' Henry , ' she repeated , ' Henry ! It 's me . I 've come back . ' The wavering eyes came to a focus and a moment later there was the faintest dawn of recognition  --  for a few seconds only ; then it faded . The eyes drifted away again , the lips hegan to move ; he had fallen hack into the world of his delirium . The miracle had miscarried ; Lazarus remained unraised , There was a long silence . Then heavily , hopelessly , ' I guess I 'd better go to bed , ' Katy said at last . " " And the miracle ? " I asked . " Did she pull it off the next morning ? " " How could she ? With no virtue , no life in her , nothing but her will and her anxiety . Which is worse , I wonder  --  being desperately ill yourself , or watching somebody you love being desperately ill ? One has to begin by defining the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But do I mean you ? Is n't it , in fact , the new , limited personality created by the fever and the toxins ? A personality without intellectual interests , without social obligations , without material concerns . Whereas the loving nurse remains her normal self , with all her memories of past happiness , all her fears for the future , all her worried awareness of a world beyond the four walls of the sickroom . " And then there 's the question of death . How do you react to the prospect of death ? If you 're sick enough , you reach a point where , however passionately you may be fighting for life , a part of yciu would n't be at all sorry to die . Anything rather than this misery , this interminahly squalid nightmare of finding oneself reduced to a mere lump of suffering matter ! ' Give me liberty or give me death . ' But in this case the two are identical . Liberty equals death equals the pursuit of happiness  --  but only , of course , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has no right to the luxury of death , to deliverance , through surrender , from her sickroom-prison . Her business is to go on fighting even when it 's perfectly obvious that the battle is lost ; to go on hoping , even when there are no reasons for anything but despair ; to go on praying , even when God has manifestly turned against her , even when she knows for certain that He does n't exist . She may be sick with grief and foreboding but she must act as though she were cheerful and serenely confident . She may have lost courage ; but she must still inspire it . And meanwhile she 's working and waking beyond the limits of physical endurance . And there 's no respite ; she must be constantly there , constantly available , constantly ready to give and give  --  to go on giving , even when she 's completely bankrupt . " Yes , bankrupt , " he repeated . " That 's what Katy was . Absolutely bankrupt , but compelled by circumstances and her own will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , the spending was fruitless . Henry did n't get well ; he merely refrained from dying . And meanwhile she was killing herself with the long , sustained effort to keep him alive . T I I E DAYS passed  --  three days , four days , I ca n't remember how many . And then came the day I shall never forget . April 23 , 1923 . " " Shakespeare 's birthday . " " Mine too . " " Yours ? " " Not my physical birthday , " Rivers explained . " That 's in October . My spiritual birthday . The day of my emergence from half-baked imbecility into something more nearly resembling the human form . I think , " he added , " we deserve a little more Scotch . " He refilled our glasses . " April the twenty-third , " he repeated . " What a day of miseries ! Henry had had a bad night and was definitely worse . And when , at lunchtime , Katy 's sister telephoned from Chicago , it was to announce that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a paper before one of the local scientific societies . When I got home at eleven , I found only the nurse . Katy , she told me , was in her room , trying to get a little sleep . There was nothing I could do . I went to bed . " Two hours later I was startled ont of unconsciousness by the groping touch of a hand . The room was pitch dark ; but my nostrils immediately recognized the aura of womanhood and orrisroot surrounding the unseen presence . I sat up . ' Mrs. Maartens ? ' ( 1 still called her Mrs. Maartens . ) The silence was pregnant with tragedy . ' Is Mr. Maartens worse ? ' I asked anxiously . " There was no immediate answer , only a move . ment in the darkness , only the creaking of springs as she sat down on the edge of the bed . The fringes of the Spanish shawl she had thrown over her shoulders brushed my face ; the field of her fragrance enveloped me . Suddenly and with horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetites , Laura Was a graduate of Miss Floggy 's . What blasphemy , what a hideous desecration ! I was overcome by shame , and my shame deepened to an intense , remorseful self-loathing when , breaking the long silence , Katy told me in a flat expressionless voice that there had been another call from Chicago : her mother was dead . I muttered some kind of a condolence , " Then the flat voice spoke again . ' I 've been trying to go to sleep , ' it said . ' But I ca n't : I 'm too tired to sleep . ' There was a sigh of hopeless weariness , then another silence . " ' Have you ever seen anyone die ? ' the voice went on at last . But my military service had n't taken me to France , and when my father died , I had been staying at my grandmother 's place . At twenty-eight I knew as little of death as of that other great encroachment of the organic upon the verbal , of experience upon our notions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cutoffncss that 's so terrible , ' I heard her saying . ' You sit there , helplessly , watching the connections being broken , one after the other . The connection with people , the connection with language , the connection with the physical universe . They ca n't see the light , they ca n't feel the warmth , they ca n't breathe the air . And finally the connection with their own body begins to give way . They 're left at last hanging by a single thread  --  and it 's fraying away , fraying away , minute by minute . ' T HE VOICE broke and , by the muffled sound of the last words , I knew that Katy had covered her face with her hands . ' All alone , ' she whispered , ' absolutely alone . ' The dying , the living  --  everyone is alone always . There was a little whimper in the darkness , then a shuddering , convulsive movement , a hardly human cry . She was sobbing . I loved her and she was in anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say was , ' Do n't cry . ' " Rivers shrugged his shoulders . " If you do n't believe in God or an afterlife  --  which of course as a minister 's son , I did n't , except in a strictly Pickwickian sense  --  what else can you say in the presence of death ? Besides , in this particular case , there was the grotesquely embarrassing fact that I could n't decide what to call her . Her grief and my compassion had made it impossible to say ' Mrs. Maartens , ' but on the other hand ' Katy ' might seem presumptuous , might even sound as though I were trying to exploit her tragedy for the baser purposes of a scoundrel , who found it impossible to forget Miss Floggy and the thing-slide of Henry 's subhuman soliloquy . " ' Do n't cry , ' I went on whispering , and in lieu of the prohibited endearments , of the Christian name which I dared not pronounce , I laid a timid hand on her shoulder and clumsily patted her . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brokenly , ' I promise I 'll behave properly tomorrow . ' And after another paroxysm of weeping , ' I have n't cried like this since before I was married . ' " It was only later that the full significance of that last phrase began to dawn on me . A wife who permitted herself to cry would never have done for poor old Henry . His chronic weakness had compelled her to be unremittingly strong . But even the most stoical fortitude has its limits . That night Katy was at the end of her tether . Shc had suffered a total defeat  --  but a defeat for which , in a sense , she was grateful . Circumstances had beers too much for her . But , by way of compensation , she had been granted a holiday from responsibility , had been permitted , if only for a few brief minutes , to indulge in the , for her , unprecedented luxury of tears . ' Do n't cry , ' I kept repeating . But actually she wanted to cry , she felt the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the best possible reasons for crying . Death was all around her  --  it had come for her mother , it was coming , inevitably , so it seemed , for her husband , it would be there in a few years for herself , in a few more years for her children . They were all moving toward the same consummation  --  toward the progressive cutting of the lines of communications , toward the slow , sure attrition of the sustaining threads , toward the final plunge , alone , into the emptiness . " From somewhere far away over the housetops a clock struck the three-quarters . The chimes were a man-made insult added gratuitously to a cosmic injury  --  a symbol of time 's incessant passage , a reminder of the inevitable end . ' Do n't cry , ' I implored her , and forgetting everything but my compassion , I moved my hand from the nearer to the further of her shoulders , and drew her closer . " Shaken by sobs and trembling , she pressed herself against use . The clock had struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were utterly alone . Our only advantage over the dead woman up there in Chicago , over the dying man at the other end of the house , consisted in the fact that we could be alone in company , could juxtapose our solitudes and pretend that we had fused them into a community . But these , of course , were not the thoughts I was thinking then . Then there was no room in my mind for anything but love and pity and an intensely practical concern for the well-being of this goddess who had suddenly become a weeping child , this adored Beatrice who was now trembling , in just the way that little dogs can tremble , within the circle of my protecting arm . I touched the hands with which she was covering her face ; they were stone cold . And the bare feet  --  cold as ice . ' But you 're frozen ! ' I said almost indignantly . " And then , thankful that at last it was possible for me to translate my pity into useful action , ' You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At once . ' I visualized myself tenderly tucking her in , then drawing up a chair and sitting , quietly watchful , like a mother , while she went to sleep . But when I moved to get out of bed , she clung to me , she would n't let me go . I tried to disengage myself , I tried to protest . ' Mrs. Maartens ! ' But it was like protesting against the clutch of a drowning child ; the act was at once inhuman and useless . And meanwhile she was chilled to the bone and trembling ? trembling uncontrollably . I did the only thing that was left for me to do . " " You mean , you got under the covers too ? " Under the covers , " he repeated , " with two cold bare arms round my neck and a shuddering , sob-shaken body pressed against my own . " Rivers drank some whisky and leaning back in his chair , sat for a long time smoking in silence . " The truth , " he said at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the witnesses take the same oath and testify about the same events . The result , of course , is fifty-seven varieties of fiction . Which of them is nearest the truth ? Stendhal or Meredith ? Anatole France or D. H. Lawrence ? The fountains of our deepest life shall be Confused in Passion 's golden purity or the Sexual Behavior in the Human Female ? " " Du you know the answer ? " I inquired . He shook his head . M AYBE one could describe the event in relation to three co-ordinates . " In the air before him Rivers traced with the stem of his pipe two lines at right angles to one another , then from their point of intersection , added a vertical that took his hand above the level of his head . " Let one of these lines represent Katy , another the John Rivers of thirty years ago , and the third , John Rivers as I am today . Now , within this frame of reference , what can we say about the night of April 23 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a good deal more of the truth than can be conveyed in terms of any single fiction . Let 's begin with the Katy line . " He drew it again , and for a moment the smoke of his pipe waveringly marked its position in space . " It 's the line , " he said , " of a born pagan forced by circumstances into a situation , with which only a thoroughgoing Christian or Buddhist could adequately deal . It 's the line of a woman who has always been happily at home in the world and who suddenly finds herself standing on the brink of the abyss and invaded , body and mind , by the horrible black emptiness confronting her . Poor thing ? She felt herself abandoned , not by God ( for she was congenitally incapable of monotheism ) but by the gods  --  all of them , from the little domestic hires and penates to the high Olympians . They had left her and taken everything with them , She had to find her gods again . She had to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , order of things . " She had to re-establish her contacts with life ? with life at its simplest , life in its most unequivocal manifestations , as physical companionship , as the experience of animal warmth , as strong sensation , as hunger and the satisfaction of hunger . It was a matter of self-preservation . And that is n't the whole story , " Rivers added . " She was in tears , grieving for the mother who had just died , grieving for the husband who might die tomorrow . " There 's a certain affinity between the more violent emotions . Anger modulates only too easily ' into aggressive lust , and sorrow , if you give it a chance , will melt almost imperceptibly into the most delicious sensuality . After which , of course , He giveth His beloved sleep . In the context ofbereavement , love is the equivalent of barbiturates and a trip to Hawaii . Nobody blames the widow or the orphan for resorting to these alleviations . So why condemn them for trying to preserve their life and sanity by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemning them , " I assured him . " But other people have other views . " " And thirty years ago I was one of them . " He ran his pipe up and down the imaginary vertical in front of him . " The line of the virgin prig of twenty-eight , the line of the ex-Lutheran and ex-mother 's boy , the line of the Petrarchan idealist . From that position I had no choice but to think of myself as a treacherous adulterer , and of Katy as  --  what ? The words were too hideous to be articulated . Whereas from Katy 's goddess-eye viewpoint nothing had happened that was not entirely natural , and anything that was natural was morally good . Looking at the matter from here " ( and he indicated the line of John Rivers-Now ) , " I 'd say we were both of us ' half right and therefore wholly wrong  --  she by being beyond good and evil on the merely Olympian level ( and the Olympians , of course , were nothing but a pack of superhuman animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond good and evil at all , but still mired up to the ears in the all too human notions of sin and social convention . To be wholly right , she should have come down to my level and then gone further , on the other side ; whereas I should have climbed to her level and , having found it unsatisfactory , pressed forward to join her at the place where one is genuinely beyond good and evil in the sense of being , not a superhuman animal , but a transfigured man or woman . I F WE HAD been at that level , should we have done what we then ( lid ? It 's an unanswerable question . And in actual fact we were n't at that level . She was a goddess who had temporarily broken down and was finding her way home to Olympus by the road of sensuality . I was a divided soul committing a sin all the more enormous for being accompanied by the most ecstatic pleasure . Alternately and even , at moments , simultaneously , I was two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fortune to find himself in the arms of a woman at once uninhibited and motherly , profoundly tender and profoundly sensual , and a conscience-stricken wretch , ashamed of having succumbed to what he had been taught to regard as his basest passions and shocked , positively outraged ( for he was censorious as well as remorseful ) by the easy unconcern with which his Beatrice accepted the intrinsic excellence of pleasure , his Laura displayed her proficiency in the arts of love , and displayed it , what was more , in the solemn context of mortality . Mrs. Han-bury was dead , Henry was dying . According to all the rules , she should have been in crape and I should have been offering the consolations of philosophy , But in fact , in brute , paradoxical fact . There was a moment of silence . " Midgets , " he went on pensively as , behind closed lids , he studied his far-off memories . " Midgets who do n't belong to my universe . And they did n't really belong to it even then . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other World , she and I , in the dark , wordless heaven of nakedness and touch and fusion . " And what revelations in that heaven , what pentecosts ! The visitations of her caresses were like sudden angels , like doves descending . And how hesitantly , how tardily I responded . With lips that hardly dared , with hands still fearful of blaspheming against my notions , or rather my mother 's notions , of what a good woman ought to be , of what , in fact , all good women are ? ( in spite of which , and this was as shocking as it was wonderful ) my timid blasphemies against the ideal were rewarded by an answering ecstasy of delight , by a bounty of reciprocated tenderness , beyond anything I could have imagined . " But over against that nocturnal Other World stood this world  --  the world in which the John Rivers of 1923 did his daytime thinking and feeling ; the world where this kind of thing was obviously criminal , where a pupil had cheated his master and a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dark heaven was the most sordid little hell and the visiting angels nothing but the manifestations of lust in a context of adultery . Lust and adultery , " Rivers repeated with a little laugh . " How old-fashioned it sounds ! Nowadays we prefer to talk of drives , urges , extramarital intimacies . Is it a good thing ? Or a bad thing ? Or does it simply not matter one way or another ? Fifty years from now Bimbo may know the answer . " Meanwhile one can only record the fact that , on the verbal level , morality is simply the systematic use of bad language . Vile , base , foul  --  those are the linguistic foundations of ethics ; and those were the words that haunted my conscience as I lay there , hour after hour , watching over Katy 's sleep . Sleep ' ? that 's also the Other World . Otherer even than the heaven of touch . From love to sleep , from the other to the otherer . It 's that otherer otherness which invests the sleeping beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing that people adore in the Christ Child ; the thing that filled me , then , with such an inexpressible tenderness . " And yet it was all vile , base , foul . Those hideous monosyllables ! They were like woodpeckers , hainmering away at me with their cast-iron beaks . Vile , base , foul . .. But in silence between two bouts of pecking I could hear Katy quietly breathing ; and she was my beloved , asleep and helpless and therefore sacred , sacred in that Other World where all bad language , even all good language , is entirely irrelevant and beside the point . But that did n't prevent those damned woodpeckers from starting up again with undiminished ferocity . A ND THEN , against all the conventions of fiction and good style , I must have fallen asleep . For suddenly it was dawn , and the birds were twittering in the suburban gardens , and there was Katy standing beside the bed in the act of throwing her long-fringed shawl over her shoulders . For a fraction of a second I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered everything  --  the visitations in the darkness , the ineffable Other Worlds . But now it was morning , and we were in this world again , and I would have to call her Mrs. Maartens . Mrs. Maartens , whose mother had just died , whose husband might be dying , Vile , base , foul ! How could I ever look her in the face again ? " But at that moment she turned and looked me in the face . I had time to see the beginnings of her old frank , open smile ; then , in an agony of shame and embarrassment , I averted my face . Ed hoped you would n't wake tip , ' she whispered , and bending down , she kissed me , as a grownup kisses a child , on the forehead . I wanted to tell her that , in spite of everything , I still worshiped her ; that my love was as intense as my remorse ; that my gratitude for what had happened was as deep and strong as my determination that it should never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb . " And so , but for quite another reason , was Katy . If she said nothing about what had happened , it was because she judged what had happened was the sort of thing it was best not to talk about . It 's after six ' was all she said , as she straightened herself up . ' I must go and relieve poor Nurse Koppers . ' Then she turned , opened the door noiselessly and , as noiselessly , closed it behind her . I was left alone , at the mercy of my woodpeckers . Vile , base , foul ; foul , base , vile . . . By the time the bell rang for breakfast , my mind was made up . Rather than live a lie , rather than besmirch my ideal , I would go away  --  forever . " To be concluded.
