Shown on the opposite page are picture windows on a far continent-two of the four new dioramas unveiled this week at San Francisco 's California Academy of Sciences . They bring the academy 's total of dioramas to 36 , rivaling in number-and in quality-those of any natural history museum in the world . <P> Despite the advantages , and popularity , of this kind of integrated display over the old-fashioned **28;10196;TOOLONG type , it is impossible for museumkeepers to supply the demand . It takes time and money , skill and patience , to create good dioramas . First , a hunter has to bag some subjects worth putting on display . After that , at least four experts are needed : a taxidermist to make the animals look alive again , a propmaker and a landscape painter to imitate their native surroundings , and a cabinetmaker to seal the whole display under glass . <P> Dioramas are the joint result of a patient group effort . Perfect shading of the background picture into the real soil of the foreground is the first essential in achieving realism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made San Francisco 's new exhibits . The animals were shot by a Berkeley mining engineer and big-game hunter named Leslie Simson . He found a home for the carcasses at the academy , and when he died in 1940 left $100,000 to insure their proper display . Academy Director of Exhibits Cecil Tose , who did the taxidermy himself , directed the project . Prop Artist Velma Harris cut and painted the paper vegetation-and , incidentally , put to good use some African bamboo stalks that had been in the storeroom for 21 years . Two painstaking realists , Belmore Brown and Toshio Asaeda , did the background landscapes .
