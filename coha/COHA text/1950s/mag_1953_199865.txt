Like his famed humorist father , Will Rogers Jr. , 40 , has tried his hand at many things . The year his father died , he gave up polo playing and , at 23 , bought the Beverly Hills weekly Citizen . He turned it into a fat ( 20-42 pages ) , successful , community semiweekly , whose four editions now have more than 40,000 readers . He was elected to Congress , and during World War II , quit politics to become an artillery officer . Last year he tried his hand at the movies , played his father in The Story of Will Rogers . <P> Last week Publisher Rogers announced that , after 18 years , he was finally leaving the Citizen to devote his time to being a movie actor . He sold the paper for an undisclosed amount to two oldtime , small California publishers , Lowell E. Jessen and Roy A. Brown , who may turn the paper into a daily . Said Will Jr. : " A man ca n't be in two places at once . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation . You ca n't make even one movie a year and operate a newspaper , too . " His next Warner Bros , picture : The Boy from Oklahoma , a western , in which he foils the villains with lassoes instead of guns . <P> Another West Coast newspaper got a new boss last week . With the death of Publisher Philip Jackson of Portland 's Oregon Journal ( circ. 192,249 ) , his mother , 90-year-old Maria ( " Ria " ) Jackson , named General Manager William W. Knight , 44 , the new Journal boss . Spry , autocratic Ria Jackson , who ran the paper for years and still keeps an eye on it , also scotched rumors that Publisher Samuel I. Newhouse , owner of Portland 's morning Oregonian ( circ. 225,421 ) and nine other dailies , was going to buy the Journal . Said Mrs. Jackson : " I want Portland and all the world to know that the Journal has not been and is not for sale . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
