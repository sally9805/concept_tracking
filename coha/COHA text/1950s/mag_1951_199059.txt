On a rainswept runway at Toronto 's Downsview Airport , a stubby little blue-grey plane took off after a 500-ft. run and nosed upward into a steep climb . It turned back over the field at 170 m.p.h. , did tight circles and vertical banks . Then the pilot cut his speed to a plodding 55 m.p.h. and drifted over , waggling his wings to show his control of the aircraft even on the brink of a stall . At the landing , the brakes stopped the plane within 500 feet . <P> This air show , watched by U.S. Air Force procurement officers , was a dash of superfluous salesmanship by De Havilland Aircraft of Canada , Ltd. to mark the first deliveries on a big order of Beavers for the U.S. Air Force . U.S. experts were sold on the Beaver early this year when they tested the plane . They ordered 109 to start , now have plans to buy up to 750 of the rugged , $29,000 planes for battlefield air-evacuation and courier duty . <P> Easy to fly on wheels , floats or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 630-mile cruising range , the Beaver is an ideal frontier plane . Canadian bush airlines clamored for them as soon as the first one came off the assembly line in 1947 . De Havilland sold Beavers in Finland , Indonesia , Colombia , Malaya , Rhodesia and Chile . Now better than half the plant 's entire output ( currently 12 planes a month ) will be delivered to the U.S. Army and Air Force . <P> U.S. arms makers were less punctual in their deliveries to Canada . The Canadian army announced last week that despite the long-range program to standardize Canadian and U.S. arms , it will equip its 27th Brigade armored squadron in Germany with British-made Centurion tanks . Reason : the U.S. can not promise delivery on a Canadian order placed last spring for 60 of the U.S. Army 's M-47 medium tanks . The British agreed to supply 60 Centurions , standard medium tank of the Royal Armored Corps , in the near future .
