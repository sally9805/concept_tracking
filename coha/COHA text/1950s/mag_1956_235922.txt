For two days in the Senate last week a dogged trio of liberal Democrats-Missouri 's Tom Hennings , New York 's Herbert Lehman and Illinois ' Paul Douglas-urged the Senate to blast the Administration 's Civil Rights bill out of the Senate Judiciary Committee . Argued Paul Douglas , while Mississippi 's Jim Eastland , Judiciary Committee chairman , chomped on a dead cigar : " If we pierce behind the complex rules and procedures , we know , as men , that the rules of the Senate have been very skillfully devised to prevent any action on civil rights which is obnoxious to the members from the South . . . I do not believe the American people can permanently postpone dealing with this issue . But the members of the Senate who are in this quiet and at times pleasant club can not hope to escape the scrutiny of public opinion , not only of this country , but of the world . " <P> But the three Democrats , as they well knew , were working against the clock . Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much legislation was backed up for the Senate to get bogged down in a long debate on civil rights . ( And this was precisely the way that Southerners in the House had planned it as they stalled off a favorable House civil-rights vote-279 to 126-until early last week . ) " The Senator from New York is a practical man , " Knowland put it to New York 's Lehman . " It is only kidding minority groups and the American people to go through a lot of idle gestures . " <P> Thus was civil rights blocked off for the duration of the 84th Congress and postponed , in effect , for the 85th . " I merely say , " Georgia 's Dick Russell summed up the prospects for civil rights in the 85th , " that when such nefarious schemes as these are presented in the future-and we hear that they will be-there will be members of the Senate who will resort to every weapon at their command to prevent such proposals being imposed on the people of the U.S. "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
