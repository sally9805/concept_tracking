txt ALBANY , June 10 ? Governor ' Dewey 's Long Island Rail Road rehabilitation program was ap- , proved today at a special session of the Legislature despite united ' Democratic opposition . At the same time , Democratic efforts to obtain consideration for measures requested by Mayor Wagner to broaden New York City 's local taxing powers were ruled out of order . The Governor 's Long Island Rail Road plan was developed by the state-created Long Island Transit Authority in negotiations with the Pennsylvania Railroad , principal stockholder and creditor of the bankrupt-Long Island . Its principal provisions call for : CTaking the Long Island out of bankruptcy . iIncreasing commutation fares by 20 per cent to meet mounting operating costs and finance rehabilitation . Scaling down the Long Island 's obligations , past and future , for state and local taxes and grade-crossing elimination work . 9Installing a new management , and reorganizing the road 's board of directors so that at least onethird of its members are residents of the territory it serves . CiRevising the procedure by which the Long Island can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . CLending by the Pennsylvania of $5,500,000 to the Long Island to start a $58,000,000 modernization program providing new and reconditioned cars and up-to-date equipment . Delay in Fare Rise Because of the procedure necessary to give legal effect to the plan , it is almost certain that the fare increase canr.ot be put into effect before Aug. 1 at the earliest . Before the plan can be put into effect the Pennsylvania must reach an agreement with Suffolk County on scaling down its pastdue real estate taxes there , and an agreement with the state for scaling down past-due franchise taxes and obligations for gradecrossing elimination work .. As further conditions , the Pennsylvania and the Long Island Transit Authority must . get the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission to the program and the withdrawal of a pending Pennsylvania application for a 25 per cent fare increase on the Long Island . Approval of the Federal Court in Brooklyn to ending the Long Island 's bankruptcy action likewise must be obtained . In the Senate and Assembly debate today Republicans pictured the Governor 's program as the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and procuring rehabilitation of the line . Democrats , on the other hand , assailed the4lan for authorizing a 20 per cent fare increase , which they said was unnecessary , and for returning the Long Island to the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad . Opening the debate for the minority , Senator John J. Donovan Jr. , Bronx Democrat , asserted that the tax-forgiveness feature of the legislation would enable the Pennsylvania to recoup its new $5,500,000 loan to the Long Island in two years . Under terms of the bill , the tax obligations of the Long Island would be frozen for the next nine years at the rates fixed in recent compromises of past-due taxes . This represents a reduction of $2,500,000 a year in the road 's tax liability . Senator Donovan complained , moreover , that - the plan would enable the Pennsylvania to continue " milking " the Long Island as , he said , it had done in the past . The decision to return the road to Pennsylvania control , he went on , represents a complete change of position by Governor Dewey and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans , Senator Bernard Tompkins paraphrased an old Weber and Fields vaudeville skit . The Democratic position he said , was that " even if the plan was good , we would n't like it . " He defended the scaling down of the line 's tax obligations as fair and equitable . The new levels , he noted , are those which the Democratic officials of New York City and . the Republican officials of Nassau County had accepted as reasonable in a coinpromise approved by the Federal Court in Brooklyn . Tracey S. Voorhees , a member of the Long Island ' Transit Authority who had a large part in negotiating the plan , and William S. Golub , the authority 's counsel , attended the debates in the Senate and Assembly . So did Lawrence W. , Democratic leader of Nassau County , who is hoping that commuter opposition to the fare increase will enable his . party to cut into the normally heavy Republican pluralities in Nassau this fall . Democrats offered several amendments to the legislation . One by Senator Donovan would have barred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have ordered the state - to make good the real estate taxes that New York City and other local governments would forego . Both were defeated on strict partky votes . In the Senate , which acted first , the vote for passage of the three bills in Governor Dewey 's program was 37 to 18 . All the Republicans were counted in favor , all the Democrats against . ' In the Assembly , the vote was 94 to 51 for the bills . Again all the Republicans were counted in favor and all the Democrats against . Wagner Bills Offered Three bills requested by Mayor Wagner for the purpose of making unnecessary the proposed city tax on amusement admissions were offered in the Senate by Francis J. Mahoney of Manhattan , the Democratic leader , . and in the Assembly by Eugene F. Bannigan of Brooklyn , the minority leader there . In both chambers the presiding officers ruled the ' bills ? were out of order . The rulings were based on a Constitutional provision that the Legislature , at a special session , can act only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have : IlAuthorized the city to issue bonds to meet obligations of about $3,500,000 for pension claims of retired employes of the old Interborough Rapid Transit and Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporations . ( 11Permitted the issuance of bonds to meet about $10,000,000 in city obligations for judgments and claims filed against it . gRemoved a restriction on the city 's real estate taxing powers so that it could levy an additional $12,000,000 tax in the coming year . The City Administration contended that these measures would not cost the state , a cent , and would make the pending amusement tax unnecessary . Republican legislators and the Dewey Administration have contended that the amusement tax is not needed anyway . They argue that the city has enough funds in reserve accounts to balance its budget without resort to the tax . City to Challenge Plan Corporation Counsel Adrian P. Burke said yesterday the city would challenge in the courts the constitutionality of the legislation implementing the Long Island Transit Authority 's plan for rehabilitating the Long Island Rail Road . Declaring the plan involved arbitrary arid discriminatory tax treatment of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice of the plan before its publication , and was not consulted when the plan was being devised . Mr. Burke contended the tax exemption features would reduce the city 's power to tax real estate within the constitutional limit , and would have a like effect on its borrowing power . He said the real estate taxing power would be reduced the first year by $200,000 , and by $1 ; 000,000 by the fifth year . Mr. Burke estimated the loss ' of borrowing power at . $906,000 in the first year of the plan 's operation , progreSsively increasing to $4 ; 530,000 in- the-fifth year . " The plan , " he said , " represents a subsidy to the Pennsylvania , Railroad of $16,000,000 at the expense of New York City , with the state refusing to-accept a full share of ' its . ' responsibilities . " - Mr . Burke declared the plan assured the public of only one thing  --  a 20 per cent fare rise without any assurance of proved service , economies or protection against further fare rises .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
