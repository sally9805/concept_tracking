ANTHONY and Lisette moved steadily northward , away from the camp , into the wilderness of the African veld . The two lovers chose to leave the valley that had been their home , rather than face the venom and hostility of the harsh Boer farm folk . Lemaire , Lisette 's father , had found Anthony Stopford dying by a cliff . Anthony , a handsome young Englishman , had discovered gold on Lemaire 's land . Lemaire saved the stranger , trusting him not to reveal the secret that would shatter the peace and serenity of the lovely valley . At Lemaire 's farm , Anthony fell in love with Lisette and forgot the gold . But Jonathan , Lemaire 's seventeen-year-old son , was struck by gold madness . When Lemaire learned Jonathan planned to use the gold , he warned him he would kill him if he betrayed the presence of the precious ore . , Jonathan then conspired to force Anthony to tell of his discovery . Jonathan treacherously turned the Boer farmers against Anthony . Anthony was accused of being an English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not go , a meeting of the farmers was called to decide his fate . The old men wanted to cast out Anthony . The young ones , spurred by Jonathan , wanted to kill him . Before a decision had been made , the women set upon Lisette , calling her a wanton . The insane , primitive fury of the attack so shocked the Boer elders that they decided Anthony could remain . But Lisette told Anthony she could never face the women again , and asked him to take her away . Anthony and Lisette took two horses Jonathan had tethered nearby and disappeared into the veld . Despite Lemaire 's stern warning , the enraged Jonathan determined to follow Anthony and Lisette . Jacobus Bezuidenhout and Francois Madan accompanied Jonathan . Implacably , Lemaire and his son , Andries , trailed the pursuers . Lemaire knew that if Jonathan tried to shoot Stopford , Lemaire would be forced to kill his son . CONCLUSION IT was as if the land piled up toward the east in a last immense wave of anger . There was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn with weather , lifted out of it with white veins of quartz among it , and sheltered screes of white and gray at the foot of each bastion ; it was like a alighted fortress , damaged not by man , but only by the elemental hand of time . There was no path the way they went , only tracks that might perhaps have been traced by the constant feet of game , and there seemed no end to its upward surging . So , when the end came , they were not ready for it , not prepared , and as the horses came above the last deceptive brow there was suddenly before them no world , but only sky , only an endless reaching into distance , an endless reaching toward banks of cloud that floated level with them , but very far away , with below them dark shadow from the young evening . Only when they had studied that shadow , concentrated on it , dissected it , could they see that under it there was the purple of the ground again . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world ! " For a moment she hesitated and then turned with a shining face to Stopford . " And the beginning of a new one . " " Yes , it 's another world , " he said . " We can leave the open veld behind us now . I think I 've become afraid of grass . " He was speaking very slowly , his words sticking . After a ( Continued on Puge 84 ) ( Continued 1 ' 1-.1 , w I'sgr III ) pause , he wen ( on , " There 's been a terror in these last days . " She nodded sadly . " I 've felt it . There was no place to hide . " For a few minutes Stopford contemplated soberly the immense upward surge of the cliff below them . Immediately at their feet it was like a hoaae wall buffeted by weather , but smooth , sheer , impassable , and at last he said , without turning , " There 's no way down here . " Lisette responded so quickly that anxiety was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to I he gram ? " " Yes , " he said , " we must go hack . " She put out her hand , groping for him , and he saw that her eyes were so full of tears that she could not see . Striding hack to her , he put his hand round hers and held it . " II will be all right , my darling , " he assured her . " It will be all right . It ca n't fail now . " They mounted and turned to ride away from Pisgah . That night they camped still high in the mountains with the cold air of the small hours whistling over them . Three hours after dawn t they found the path . It was n game path  --  that was clear from the beginning ? but men had used it and cattle had used it . It went first upward , then struck north and then east again , then down in a strange , breakneck traverse along the cliff face by ledges that died but recovered again almost at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes of scree , by broken watercourses and by sheer earthslides . Mostly they walked , holding the horses behind them . The mare was showing signs of lameness , but they could not rest her . They went on , not eating , not waiting , driven by the wings of the terror that had taken the two of I hem in the night , the cold night . on the edge of the grass , the bitter night in the open . At dusk they came to a ravine of heavy verdure , tree ferns that mocked them out of an antique time , spreading trees and a dark dampness underfoot , and flowers . With them there were little delicate plants half seen in the half-light that had nothing of the hardihood of t he alpines in the rocks above , but only a warmth-loving , moisture-loving softness of outline . The air here was heavy , very warm , and in a dry place they camped , making their bed , but they lit no fire . This night was heavy and hot and full of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred and churred , that went by sometimes on wings that did not whistle like the upland birds ' , but soughed through the air in heavy heats . There were no jackals . Stopford missed their high ululation , but after midnight they heard the coughing grunt of a lion hunting . He felt Lisette pressing against him , but she said nothing , made no other movement , and they lay through the hours half between sleeping and waking ; wary , alert , yet strangely not afraid , not afraid as they had been the night before on the last ridge of the Berg . The sun woke them . It streamed into the little clearing where they lay and they wakened to a strange , unreal interplay of light that made the place exquisite and improbable . The light came filtered through the young leaves of a drift of small trees that marched down the slope below them . It fell into a place made green by the small fern , given strength and almost architectural structure by the columnar boles of the tree ferns and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the clearing a stream ran through sand that was silver-white in the light . The water itself was brown from the mountain stains , rich as a thin wine , snatching at every play of light that came from the leaves or from the rocks or from the high lunette of sky between the branches . They sat together on the blankets , looking at it wonderingly , for it had come to seem that there was only grass in the world . He said slowly and almost puzzled , " A lion is dangerous , but it is not evil . We have been afraid of evil . " " We 've left it behind us , " Lisette said . " They 'll never find us here . We 've passed out of one world into another . The water runs in this world . Look ! " They watched a tiny flotilla of leaves go slowly down the stream , and she said , childlike again , " And I shall ba I he . " Afterward they ate , washing down their food with cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder toward the Berg , Stopford still would not light a fire . They had the feeling that in the wall of the mountain above them , the wall that they could not see because of the I sickness of the trees in the grove , there might be heads leaned forward , searching , watching and evil . Stopford said , " I 'll go down for the horses . " " Ca n't we stay here ? " she pleaded suddenly . " I 've been so happy . " He kissed her . " I 've been happier , too , happier than ever in my life before . I think it . would be well to go while we can have this always for a memory . There is so little in the world that is perfect . " The native took a stick and a pebble . " Here was the kraal of ' Ntandeli and from it you go down the big valley first and then up the little valley . " He traced a rough cross in the gray ash of the fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead since the Bapedi came , but the path is there . White men have used it . " " He lies , " Bezuidenhout growled into his coffee . " Be quiet ! " said Jonathan harshly . " He has seen them . They went down the path two days ago and they spent the night in a kloaf at the bottom . They did not see him . " " How ' ? " demanded Bezuidenhout with a snort of disgust . " He stood in the shadow of an ant heap . The white man , he says , looked at him , but did n't see him . " " How far is this pass ? " The native shrugged his shoulders . " Half a day . " Jonathan considered and said , " Saddle up ! " All three of them looked at the weary horses . They had gone farther than the hunted ones . There had been the fruitless journey to Jangroentjies and hack , and Stopford 's break to the eastward had thrown them out . Only long riding and counter-riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with us . " Bezuidenbout looked toweringly at the native . " He is a scoundrel , but he can track for us in the bush . " " We 'll lose time with him , " said Jonathan , weighing the possibilities , " but in the end we may gain . He can run at the stirrup . " Bezuidenhout , towering over the sitting man , said , " You will run , but if you try to run away I will shoot you . " He whipped suddenly round to Jonathan . " And I would like to shoot your father too ! He is like an aasvoel ? a vulture ? he and Andries there ! " He looked furiously up the ridge to where Lernaire and Andries sat endlessly watching as they had watched for the eight days of the hunt . Jonathan said , " Leave them ! There is nothing we can do here on the High Veld  --  nothing that we could have done . Always they had the fresher horses . In the bush veld we can lose them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native who lies and your father still on top of us ! I am tired of this chase . There 's no sense in it , Jonathan . What drives you ? " " An Englishman , " answered Jonathan with a weary patience , " who has a plan against us and who has stolen the girl you wanted . " " If he has no plan against us , I will heat the life out of you , Jonathan ! ... Francois , wake up ! " " I am awake , " returned Malan stolidly . " This is all nonsense . Let 's go ! " Bezuidenhout tightened the girth brutally . Then he shouted at the native , " Lead , and hurry ! " He lifted the rhinoceros-hide sjambok on his wrist menacingly and cut through the air , Then suddenly wheeling in his saddle , he shouted , " Go home , old man ! Go home ! " Lemaire , his face gray with weariness , but his movements still strong and alert , climbed into his saddle . Andries said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the end of things . " " No , " said Lernaire , " Anthony has done very well so far for a man who does not know the country . He will be watchful . I do not yet understand this . It may he that they have hit the edge of the Berg too far to the south and have not been able to get down . " " Perhaps there is another path to the south ' ? " " I do not know it , " answered Le-metre , " but I have always used the trek path ? the easy way . " They rode on . It was as if they were attached to the three by an invisible chain . It had become a part of them , an automatic and inevitable reaction . Lemaire pondered the problem of Bezuidenhout . It was clear that he was tired , angry with tiredness . It might be possible to separate him now from the others . But that still left Malan ; he had small hope of Malan , and even if he separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew that with the infinite , unboylike patience of his nature , the acrid patience of the hunter , , Jonathan had ignored him all this while . That same acrid patience , the underlying hostility out of which it came , would take him to 1 he end . Many hours later , Bezuidenhout , with the native , turned through a narrow gully between two cliffs , and Lernaire said slowly , " It is as I thought ? there is here a path to the low country . " Bezuidenhout strode through the place of the night camp . His footsteps muddied the wine-colored water of the stream . " They made no fire , " he said , " and it is because they are afraid  --  more afraid of us than of the lions . Huh ! " He grunted heavily . He had no real conception of that fear . Jonathan , thinking more analytically , could feel his sister 's terror . He looked round the camp sardonically . " Now " ? he nodded to the native " he must find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . It cut with a noise like a snake . " Find them ! " he shouted . " Find them ! " The trail was easy enough to find , pathetically easy . In this softened earth there was no chance of concealment . Steadily , with his terrible inhuman patience , Jonathan followed where they had gone , always recovering from the checks , always moving on . Lower down the slopes they reached a stretch of savannah , long elephant grass and trees more widely ' spaced . As they entered it Bezuidenhout saw , standing in the shade , an eland cow . His gun came to his shoulder , but , as it reached it , he heard Jonathan 's furious voice , " Do n't be a fool ! If they are close they 'll hear us ! " " You are mad besides having the devil in you ! " Bezuidenhout shouted back . " We need meat ! I am hungry , man ! I tell you , I am hungry ! " The eland cow had vanished . " Dismount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , We can not go on as we are . Nine days we have ridden , and when they are perhaps not half a day away , when we know that one of their horses is lame and that they can not go far , you would spoil it all for a little fresh meat . What sort of a fool will you look when you get back to the High Veld ? The man who rode to punish the Englishman who stole his girl , and stopped in sight of them ! Man , you make me sick ! " Malan leaned against a tree regarding them both without sympathy and without curiosity . He was as tired of these quarrels as he was of this fruitless chase . THE mare was very lame now . Stop-1 ford , examining the damaged fetlock , could find only a wide swelling ; there was no external mark . He said over his shoulder to Lisette , " We 'll have to find a place where we can camp and rest her . They both need rest now and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden compassion in his eyes ? " I think we do too . We 'll find a place near the river . " " I think that will be the Crocodile River , " she said , looking at him almost supplicatingly . " I know so little more now  --  so very little ! " He smiled at her and asked gently , " What more do you need to know ' ? You have brought us here , and here , I think , we 're safe from them . Presently we 'll go on again until we find the Portuguese . This hides us . " They came to the river in the silence of the noon hush sooner than he had expected . No beasts moved and the monkeys in the trees were quiet with it . The lion struck out of the silence in a quick swirl of gold . They did not see it . Stopford was down the bank a little ; the mare left behind ; Lisette had ridden twenty yards down the path . They were searching each hollow in the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They knew nothing till the sudden high-pitched scream of a horse in agony and in terror slashed with a quick brutality across the silence . Stopford came in one bound to the level of the hank and , as he reached it , he saw the lion . The mare was rearing up , disemboweled and bloody , the lion was turning in an unbelievably elastic movement to spring at its throat . For a second Stopford did nothing , paralyzed by the improbability of it ; then suddenly his gun was at his shoulder and almost without volition he had pulled the trigger . Instantly , in a golden streak , he saw the lion leap for the tall grass . Lisette sat frozen to the saddle , her lips bloodless , her eyes covering the grass . His own eyes watched , too , wary , filled with an infinite suspicion . This had been sanctuary ' . When he had reloaded he went to the mare , undid the girth and took off the saddle , handing it to Lisette . They went on , not talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's horse , and in a short while they came to a place where the track ran diagonally across the bank into the water and seemed to come up upon the farther side . Sounding with a pole , they crossed the river . There was no sign of crocodiles . Ahead of them there was a low hill of granite . Great smooth slabs lay under the sun like whalebacks ; at the top there was a cluster of gigantic boulders , enormous rounded rocks that towered like the ruins of a fortress . About it t here WAS a girdle of small trees , thorns and thin , stunted palms , and out of the boulders of the top grew one great tree , very old , umbrellalike and gnarled with the weathers . The path bent to t he eastward from the ford , but Stop-ford turned off without hesitation to t he west , and Lisette followed him . " We 'll camp here , " he said . " The river curves right round these rocks . on three sides at least we 'll he safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his voice a new buoyancy . Up on the rock above them they heard the deep , grunting signal of a sentinel baboon . They found a place for a camp in the circle of rock , a cove hollowed out of the main mass of the granite . Stopford helped Lisette stiffly from the saddle and held her for a moment . " It couldn't. be helped about the mare . It has happened and that 's all there is to it . I do n't think she would have been any use anyway . It means only that we 'll be longer on the road . We 'll get over that , but now we must rest , and 1 he horse too . There 's grass enough here for him to eat for the first two days . " Again there was the cough of a baboon , and he added lightly , " We 'll leave them alone . They will look out for us . " Lemaire stared at the footprints in the stream . Half of them were obliterated by the hoof scars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the story clear . He said to Andries , - The mare was very lame and Anthony was leading her . Lisette was still riding . They can not he far. - He - made a lit lie gesture of despair . " I had hoped that if they had gone far enough Bezuidenhout would break the thing up in his folly . That , will not happen now . There is no plan that we can make except to try to give them warning . But it is necessary that you should know this , Andries : if Jonathan shoots at Stopford , I will myself shoot him . " He seemed to expand a little as he said this , to straighten his shoulders , as if a last and final decision had been made . There was a brief silence before he continued sadly , " He is my son , but there is no rest for us and no peace while he lives , I think , and there is no peace for our land . What is it in him that has brought this ? What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked up with a sudden anguish in his face . " I did not need proof that gold was evil . I knew it before this . Why should this thing be on me ? " His eyes fastened on Andries again . " If I fail  --  if I am myself shot  --  you must take t his upon yourself . Do you see that ? " Andries nodded very slowly . but when be spoke , his voice was steady and determined . He said only . " He will not go hack . " Lemaire picked up his gun . Facing toward the east , he lifted it to his shoulder and tired into the low sky . Instantly the three men with the native sitting in the shade of a patch of thorn trees a hundred yards ahead of them leaped to their feet , their guns in their hands . Lemaire disregarded them utterly ; without moving and with the ease of long practice , he began to reload . " We will do that every mile , " he said evenly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else for us to do . " Jonathan stood looking at the picked skeleton . There was enough of t he hide and the mane about for him to recog nizo the carcass ? it did not need the mute evidence of I he hoofs . It was Malan who said , " That was your mare . " The native spoke swiftly , with h a certain fear . Jonathan asked , " Lion ? " and looked where the native pointed . " She was lame ; they left her behind and the lion got her . " The native spoke again , and pointed to a place where Stopford 's boot clearly overlapped the spoor of the lion in the dust . " It does n't matter , " said Jonathan . " She 's dead . It 's just another thing . They will be close somewhere . " He spoke to the native and the man went forward , his eyes to the ground . As they followed they heard behind them another warning shot . Only Jonathan made no move ; the others turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun the warnings . The baboons had heard the shots first . All through the morning they had been uneasy . There were seven of them  --  two males , three females and two young ones . It was the old male that had first detected the sound , and down below in the small hay between the smoothness of the rocks Lisette and Stopford had heard his grunting call . They had made out a shot themselves in the middle of the morning . Lisette , sitting in the shadow of the trees , called up to Stopford as he sat on watch , his eyes toward the ford , " It was a gun ! " " Yes , a long way away , " he said , and came slithering down the rock to sit beside her . Looking at her , he asked , " Are you afraid ' ? " She nodded . " Yes , I am afraid . " " I 'm afraid also , " he said simply , " hut it seems to me that there is one thing only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and see what comes . I do n't understand this shooting . That 's what the baboons heard earlier in t he morning  --  I 'm sure of that . If it 's Jonathan , then I ca n't understand anything of this . He would n't come giving us warning . " " No , " she agreed , " that would n't be Jonathan . It might be natives hunting . They have guns , some of them . " " It might be . " " If we saddled and went on ? " Her voice ended on a question . " If it is them , then they have tracked us as far as this and they would track us wherever we went . They would he mounted , but we can only move at a man 's pace . No , we must wait , here . We have in these rocks the advantage of the ground , now we know that they are coming . " He bent and kissed her . Then he clambered up onto the rock again . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shimmering anger , the whole world , except only the baboons and the cicadas , was asleep ; nothing stirred in the grass , nothing moved under the trees , the game was resting , even the birds were quite still . The sun moved very slowly , dragging the shadows across the hot griddle of the rock . The old baboon seemed to be watching something across the river to the west . He stayed on his lookout rock quite still , one knuckle just clear of the surface , waiting . The last shot was very near . It woke echoes in the rocks . It sent the baboons into a fury of impotent anxiety , but in the grass nothing else stirred , and when the echoes had died and the baboons had quieted themselves , the sun still dragged the reluctant shadows and the rock shimmered . Only the old baboon turned slowly from the west toward the south , and Stopford , watching him , knew that his eyes could see or his ears hear from the silence something that told him of movement beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pointing sullenly to it , he said , " They are there . " Jonathan nodded and sat silently , considering the place . Pulling a branch aside , the native pointed down the river , and Jonathan picked out . the scar of the path over the bank . Again they were silent and once again the silence was broken by a quick question to the guide . When he had got his answer . Jonathan said , " That place is almost an island . The river goes right round the foot of the rocks . There is only a neck of land where the path crosses . They will expect us to come that way . You and Francois and this man must go by the ford . " " And you ? " Bezuidenhout was belligerent and suspicious . " I will cross the river by myself up there and take him from the back . " " While we get shot , " said Bezuidenbout ponderously . " He wo n't shoot you . He 's an Englishman . He will talk . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious light of distaste in his eyes , but he said at length , " It 's a plan , " and pulling at his horse 's head , trudged on toward the ford . Jonathan rode back down the path to where his father and Andries waited in the shadow , watching him . When he was level with them , Lemaire said suddenly , " Stop ! " Something in the tone brought the horse to a halt for a minute , but Jonathan did not turn to his father . ' Twice I have warned you . This is the last time . if you shoot Stopford , it will be because of the gold , and I will shoot you . This you must know . " There was an earnestness , a passion in Lemaire 's voice . Jonathan kicked with his heels against the tired flanks of the horse , and it went forward reluctantly . To his back , Lemaire said , " This is your last chance , Jonathan ! Go hack up the mountain ! There is no end for you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly stung , retorted , " You would n't dare ! I am your son ! " But Lemaire answered , " There are principles that are greater than blood . " Slowly , reluctantly , he turned his own horse and followed . As he turned he said , " You moat watch the others now , Andries . This is my cross . " Lisette said , " Jacobus Bezuidenhout is the first , and Francois Malan . There is no sign of Jonathan . " Stopford felt his mouth grow dry suddenly . This he had not foreseen ; it was difficult to calculate it now . Malan and Bezuidenhout would not . have come by themselves  --  of that he was sure , even in his scant knowledge of them . The one he reckoned as a jackal , the other as a bully and a fool ; both of them lacking the tenacity , the drive and urge to make this long pursuit . " He may be just behind them , " he said , half to himself . Then on an impulse he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topmost rock . He could see two baboons now , the one staring impassively toward the ford where the two white men with the native were coming slowly through the green water , but the old one , the sentinel , the head of the tribe , was staring across the great curve of the river toward the west . Stopford said , " I think Jonathan will try to take us from the back . The old baboon thinks so too . " " It will lie like him , " she answered . He got slowly to his feet and looked down at her . " These others do not matter . Shout , to them , when they are close enough , hat you will shoot . They will stop then , I 'm sure of that . I 'll watch for Jonathan . " Jonathan led his horse into the water down a slide that the game had made for a drinking place . He moved stiffly , like an automaton , as if he were driven by something outside himself , not looking upstream or down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse to the water and , freeing himself from the saddle , swam beside it . Out of the corner of his eye he saw a swirl come down the river , and he thought of crocodiles , but Jonathan went on , blind , urgent , undeviating , until the horses lifted out with the water streaming from them , splashed on toward the bank and climbed out , each in turn . Lemaire watched Jonathan tether his horse to one of the small trees below the hot slope of the rock . It was time now , he thought , to fire the last of his warning shots . Suddenly he realized why Jonathan had made no attempt to get away from him , no attempt to move faster . If he fired , his gun would he empty for the period of the reloading , and for that period he would be at Jonathan 's mercy . The boy was mad now ; he had no doubt of that . Whatever the impulse that had driven him before , there had descended on him in this pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it . If his gun were empty , Jonathan would turn on him  --  he had a positive certainty of that . He shrugged his shoulders ; they were so close now there was no need to waste a shot , a shout would do ; he felt the tension slough once again . Jonathan went forward to the naked rock and began to climb . In that instant he heard the deep , rough " Rorgitem ! " of an old baboon . He was sure that Stopford and Lisette were not by the smoke . They must have heard the shots , they must have had the warning . Perhaps they had gone on or perhaps this rock was to them like a castle , a strong place ; per-hap they were waiting , watching . He looked at the priming of his gun and held it ready across his body ; very slowly he began to climb aft erJonathan a little to the left . Behind the rock more baboons were barking . Stopford came almost to the head of a great shallow crack between two sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small patch of low bushes and grass ; the rocks gave perfect cover . He moved more slowly now , certain that beyond him he could see the whole arc of the river , and , crawling the last few feet , he came to a place where a gnarled stump stood up out of the little tangle of bushes , and looked out . The river was empty , but he could see something moving between the intervals of the fringe of bushes on the far side ; almost at once he saw a horse come out and could recognize Jonathan . He watched him put his horse to the water and begin to swim ; then he saw the other horse . He had been expecting Jonathan only ; for the moment he wondered indifferently who this other was ; then with a shocked surprise he saw that it was Lemaire . The heat seemed to go out of the day . a numbness took him . Jonathan he had known would be coming ; he had never doubted it , not even in these days of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks below and rested ; always he had been certain that Jonathan in the end would come . He could not tell why , except that through his being he felt the malevolence , the deep , bitter concentration of Jonathan 's nature . But Lemaire ? he could not fathom this . He could not believe that Lemaire would have come in their pursuit . Lemaire would have accepted their flight . He had given his promise about the gold . Yet he was here with Jonathan . He watched them painfully while they crossed . There was something here that he could not puzzle out , something even beyond the appearance of Lemaire . Jonathan moved with an inhuman , a somnambulistic precision , not deviating , not hesitating . He came forward over the water to the shallow bank . Stopford watched him tether his horse and come away from it ; behind him he saw Lemaire tether his horse in his turn ; they did not speak . Jonathan did not look ! lack . He cllm bed on his own , st iffly , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick , nervous footing , his gun held ready . For a short time he was out of sight under the curve ; then he came into view again . Stopford heard a rustle and a scrape on the rock below him . Lisette was at his feet . " Go back , my darling , " he urged quietly . " What must , happen I do not want you to see . " " Andries is here with them . " Very sadly he said , " And your father is with Jonathan . " Lisette said softly , " You must speak to him lira . We must leave no chance without trying . " Then , with a quick gust of passion . " If you die , my darling . I must die too . for I have nothing left in the world ! " He said , not taking his eyes from Jonathan as he came the last steep yards of the great whale of rock on which he climbed , " Keep still ! We must not talk of death . " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his veins and in his nerve ends , in the very skin of his finger tips , an indescribable , urgent . sensitivity . It was as if he was alive to the smallest , most unimportant detail of this place  --  the very waves of heat that struck off the rock , the tone and tenor of the sentinel 's challenge , the shape and beauty of the unetirring leaves . His gun went up slower and still more slow , and as the sights came on , he called out , " Jonathan ! " He saw Jonathan freeze and turn to his voice . It . was patent that he had been taken by surprise , t hat he had believed Stopford to be on the far side of the rocks in another quarter . It was like the awakening of a somnambulist , the harsh breaking of unearthly calm . He saw Jonathan 's gun come up . and again he shouted , " Put it down ! " Then , his glance flickering beyond , he saw Lemaire 's head and shoulders over the slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was aimed at Jonathan . Instantly and with a passionate relief he knew that Lemaire had come to help . Whatever strangeness lay in this . whatever mystery there was , this , thing was certain . In a strong voice he called out , " Drop your gun , Jonathan ! " There was no breath of movement , no shadow of sound , not even a wing beat in the heavy air . He waited while he watched Jonathan 's gun come slowly up and up toward his shoulder . Lemaire shouted , " Jonathan , drop your gun ? " Still the gun came up , and to Lisette at his feet Stopford said in a swift , overwhelming agony , " Lisette , I must kill your brother . " In that moment , as Jonathan 's gun came to his shoulder , he fired , and in the very instant after be tired they heard a bullet shriek past them to lose itself in the stillness of the rocks . Jonathan stayed absolutely still where he was for so long that it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made ; then he stumbled and made a little hunched running to the left . His feet appeared to lose control , the pace increased , he was lurching down the slope . Suddenly he pitched over , his body , hardly touching the smooth rock , shot downward . Lemaire stood motionless as if he were a part of the immemorial rock . In a strange panic Stopford watched him . He made no effort to get out of the way , but they heard him shout as the body of his son hit him and they saw him fall in his turn and disappear from sight . Lisette , unseeing , but with all the old instinct knowledge of the pioneer , said in an urgent whisper , " Reload . There are the others . " He reached mechanically for the rammer . When it was done he slipped down the gully and up behind another covering shoulder of the rock until he could see Bezuidenhout with Malan leaning on their guns looking upward and Andries standing a short distance from them , cradling his gun in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " Andries , take their guns from them ! " Lemaire could move his arms , but it seemed as if his body ended at hi# waist. ; he could lind no knowledge of beyond that , no sensation . His nerves could not convey their messages , and he knew at once with an acute and adamant vision that he must die . His mind was strangely calm , as if he had known all through these days , all through this journeying , that at the end of it there was death ; perhaps he had known even before this journeying , He did not want to die and yet there was justice in it . At least he would die without the blood of his own son upon his hands . He had wanted to keep the upland country , the High Veld , the Transvaal , TIM clean of the curse of gold , wanted it sufficiently to sacrifice his own sbn . There was justice in the judgment that to assure it he had had to sacrifice him-self , He wanted suddenly to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be was astonished that he could want , that he still had desires . For Jonathan he had no sorrow , no feeling except guilt , for Jonathan was the son that he had made . His mouth was dry and he felt thirsty , and a wonder took him that so small a thing as water could cut across this balancing of the intangibles . Above him on the rock he heard the scrape of feet . Lemaire looked up at Stopford and then at Lisette with a strange resignation . " It had to end like this , I think , " he murmured . Lisette , on her knees beside him , asked , " Are you hurt badly , father ? " He answered with a wondering patience , " I think my hack is broken . There is no pain in it ; there is no feeling either . And Jonathan ' ? " " He is dead , " said Stopford somberly . " I had to shoot . He 'd seen me and he would not put down his gun . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemaire , " there was no other way . If you had not shot , I would have had to shoot him . You saved me that . " Stopford made a quick , almost frightened gesture . but he said only . " It had to he . We 'll get the others and make a litter and take you to the camp . " " There is no need . There is nothing that you can do for me except bring me water . I know the feel of death . " Lisette , kneeling beside him , looked at him with h her face strained and white , but her eyes dry . " Why did you follow us ? Tooni wrote to you that he would riot touch the gold . " Stopford said , " Your father came to help us . " He realized abruptly that she had not seen , from where she lay , Lemaire'a gun lifted against his own son on the rock . Lemaire said softly , " I had no writing , no message . " EVENING POST " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep grief in his voice . " I think you knew . my mind . " " I knew it , " agreed Lemaire quietly . " We 'll get the others . It will be best to move you as gently as we can . " Stopford turned and ran up over the rock . " He 's left his gun ! " exclaimed Lisette , in sudden panic . " That does not matter either , " said Lemaire . " Nothing matters now . It is all over . Do you love him very much , Lisette ? " For the first time she broke down . " I have nothing in the world but him and you . " Very sadly he whispered , " You are so young and life is very long . Listen , I ! MIA tell you what I can while I can . You must not . go back to the High Veld . There will he no life for you there now . When they come , I will try to write . You must , go down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andries will have Jangroentjies and the cattle . He is young and the country is young ; it is enough for him . You will have Languedoc . That is Anthony 's recompense . He must forget the gold ? utterly . " " He has forgotten it , father ; for your sake he has forgotten it . " " Nothing matters then , " said Lemaire ; " nothing matters . In the end " ? the same awful clarity that had taken him when first he knew his own death held him again ? " in the end it will be found . but if we have saved even one generation , it is something . " He moved his head wearily until he could see into her eyes as she knelt , staring down at him . " At the foot of the rock where the horses are there is a patch of aloes . The jangmentjres have nested there ; I saw the nest as I went by the rock . That is an omen and a sign for you . " Lisette put her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the rock face . He heard the deep rumbling of Bezuidenhout 's voice before he saw the men . They had moved up toward the entrance of the camp , but they still stood with their gun butte resting in the dust with t and AndriesAl his gun iee a As he came full in sight of them , he said , " It 's over . " He stretched his hands palm outward . " Jonathan is dead and your father is dying . . ld rsetidlly.st niollurYbeyond 91 Come , Amides ! " " My father ? " " I killed Jonathan , " said Stopford in a high , almost mechanical voice . " I warned him , but he would not take my warning . Your father was on the slope below him . As Jonathan fell , he swept your father down . Lisette is with him . Come ! " " My father , " said Andries brokenly , and came toward him . Bezuidenhout said wonderingly , " It is over . " And then after a little , " We will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one looked at the body of Jonathan as they went past it . Slowly and very carefully the four of them lifted Lemaire from the rocks to the shadow of the trees below and laid him on the blankets wit h a pillow of coats for his head . Malan went to the river for water , and he drank . He made no sign while they carded him , there was no shadow of pain ; the life was ebbing very slowly out of him , but there was not yet in him anything of the agony of death . When he had drunk he asked , " Have you paper ? Something with which to write ? " Stopford thought for a moment . " There 's the back of the map . " " Good ! Now write as I tell you . " Quietly and very deliberately Lemaire dictated a brief will . " These two " ? he indicated Malan and Bezuidenhout ? " mustwitness it . " When it was done he said , " That will serve in Cape law . For the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are young . " His eyes moved to Stopford again . " When it is over " ? it was curious how a man could not say . " When I am dead " ? " when it is over , go north from here . You came too far to the south when you broke away from the trek path ; the road to the Por-tuguese is north . Go to them and find a ship for the Cape ; there is no other way for you . " He looked at Bezuidenhout . " You are a big man , Jacobus , but you have been a fool . I think you know that now . " Bezuidenhout nodded . " I know it . I have known it since before we came down the Berg . " " He could not help himself either , " said Lemaire very slowly , and they knew that he spoke of Jonathan . " We can none of us help ourselves . I think I would like to lie close to him when I die , " At last he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late coolness with the last of the old moon just at the eastern shadow of the trees , and there was almost no sign of his death , only that in the firelight a shadow crossed his face , and Lisette , beside him , holding his hands against her knees , said , low and in a deep anguish , " He is dead . " For a while she knelt and then she placed his hand across his breast , and Stopford , putting his arm round her , lifted her to her feet and took her away . They walked out beyond the line of the firelight toward the river until they could see the open , quiet level of the water , and Lisette , turning to him , said , " He told me that the fangroentfies had nested here at the foot of the rock . " Stopford , bending down to her , said , " I think perhaps he meant that we could make a borne in any place . " " With love , " she whispered , " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
