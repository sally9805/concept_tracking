txt The Federal Communications Cornmission 's reiteration of its ruling that requires television newscasters to give " equal time " to all candidates running for office shows us , once again , what an impasse can be reached when philosophy and reality collide head on . The " equal time " principle is imbedded in the Communications Act . It is aimed at preventing a radio or TV station from attempting to control an election by showing a candidate it may prefer and refusing to show a candidate it opposes , or by giving free time to one and charging exorbitant fees for time to another . Insofar as the mile applied to paid political broadcasts , it made sense . But nobody , until recently , thought that the ruling could apply to news . And until last February it did n't . But last February a candidate for election as mayor of Chicago brought the issue of newscasts to the Commission on the ground that Mayor Daley of Chicago . who was running for re-election , had been shown on TV welcoming the President of Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that unless the candidate received " equal time " on the newscast the principle would have been violated . Now , so far as the philosophy of fairness goes , certainly the law can be interpreted exactly as . the F.C.C. has ruled . But so far as reality goes , the ruling is like something out of Alice in Wonderland . For what this means is that any candidate anywhere can demand , and get , as much " news " attention as a public office holder . That , of course , is ridiculous , for by the nature of his office or occupation a man may make or participate in news where other men simply are not newsworthy . In fact , where politics alone is concerned , we can think of little more calculated to kill interest in newscasts about politics than to enforce such a rule as this . But another point even more important than the unrealistic effects of such a rule is the fact that it substitutes the judgment of the F.C.C. for the judgment of broadcasters on what constitutes news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Government bureaucracy deciding what news programs must present . It would be well , we think , for Congress to make clear that there is a great deal of difference between " equal time " and equal news .
