Charley Gilliland. a towheaded Ozark farm boy , learned to kill a rattlesnake and throw a mule by the time he was ten . He put in his turn milking and plowing , bought his first shotgun when he was 13 , played football and refused to play basketball ( " for sissies " ) , grew strong enough to hold a 98-lb. anvil over his head , but never once stopped dreaming of the day he would become a soldier . He sent away for cereal buttons , collected old CCC caps , medals and sheriff badges , and wore them all , strutting around the house . <P> On his 17th birthday , he talked his parents into signing his papers so that he could join the Army . When the Korean war came , he was an expert with the big Browning automatic rifle .

Gilliland asked permission to stay so that he could cover , giving his company enough time to get away . Charley Gilliland was last seen firing his BAR , still holding off the enemy attack .
