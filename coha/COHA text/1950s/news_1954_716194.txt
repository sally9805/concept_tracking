Special to The New - Sark Times . WASHINGTON , April 10 ? Secretary of State John Foster Dulles left tonight to win British and French agreement to his proposal for the creation of an antiCommunist " united front " in Southeast Asia before the Geneva conference opens April 26 . The Secretary indicated , after a talk with President Eisenhower this morning , that the United , States could not willingly abandon or yield to the postponement of its proposal for a common front against the Communist threat to Indo-China and neighboring free countries . In a statement read to reporters and newsreel and television cameramen outside the West Wing of the White House , Mr. Dulles described such a " united front " as " obviously desirable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Government 's decision to proceed as speedily as possible with " united action " in the threatened area . Mr. Dulles left by plane from the National Airport at 5:50 P. M. with that message already in the hands of the officials he will meet in London and Paris . Compromise Ropes Reported It is expected , nevertheless , that Mr. Dulles will run into stiff resistance from both Britain and France . But there were reports from London that offered hope at least of a possible compromise on the form or scope of the " united action " that Mr. Dulles called for in his speech March 29 . The Conservative press , in London has given a hint as to the possible compromise . It has indicated that the British may find more acceptable at this time Mr. , Dulles ' suggestion of establishing an Asiatic coalition in the Pacific , as against the " united action " proposal . In his statement today , the Secretary again called attention , as he and the President have done at frequent intervals lately , to the threat of Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recalling the unity achieved ' by the three Western powers at the recent Berlin conference , which gave birth to the agreement for the Geneva , meeting with the Communists on Korea and IndoChina , Mr. Dulles declared : " Now the three of us need tp join our strength and add to it the strength of others in order to create the conditions needed to assure that the conference will not lead to . a loss of freedom in Southeast Asia , but will preserve that freedom in peace and justice . " His trip to London and Paris , he said , is " a mission of- peace through strength . " It was his final statement on // the necessity for broader antiCommunist unity- : - he , has variously called it " united action " and " united will " and " united front " ? if aggression by the Chinese Communists or others ' was to be checked or defeated in Southeast Asia . To rally the strength of collective security , Mr. Dulles has consulted throughout the last week with diplomatic representatives of friendly governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some form of in expression of a " united will " Were Britain , France , Australia , New Zealand , the Philippines , Thailand and the three . Associated States of IndoChina  --  Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia . Acceptance has come so far only from Thailand . The views of at least two other ' Asian nations ,  - -  Pakistan and Ceylon  --  also ' were solicited by the State Department . It is understood on good authority , however , that they were not actually asked to join the proposed antiCommunist accord . ? ' Some Asian sources have ' expressed their belief that Mr. Dulles ' program for victory in Southeast Asia threatens to convert Indo-China into another Korea . This view is , heard particularly from those who welcome ' not only a negotiated peace there , but also the withdrawal of France from the area . Mr. Dulles sought in today 's ' ' statement to answer some of that criticism and to still those fears . The Communist threat can be ended , he said , only if all the free peoples now threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In seeking " united action " against , communism in Southeast Asia , kr ; Dillies has won backing from some important Republican Senators on ? hOm he can not always depend for support : Some of that backing has taken a form , however , that Mr. Dulles and the , Administration can not officially recognize ? a warning that United States foreign aid should be withdrawn from those Governments that refuse to join the common front . That w warnin has been sounded by Senator William F. Knowland of California , Republican floor leader , and Senator Styles Bridges , Republican of New Hampshire and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee . Democrats have emphasized , instead , the desirability of full independence for the three Associated States in Indo-China , and have asked that Mr. Dulles press the FrenCh on that point .

" I can not conceive by any stretch of the imagination that we could be guilty of extortion by intimidation when we ask that they lend their full support in joining with us to meet a grave international situation that.yitally affects not only ourselves but all free peoples . " I reiterate that We have reached the point where something more than words and idle promises are needed . In my judgment this is a good time to test whether our defense program for the free world is really a mutual effort . " Senator Estes Kefauver , Democrat of Tennessee , reiterated a call to assure the people of Indo-China that they would win their freedom as they resisted communism . The United States , he said , might be able to- prevent " another Korea " in Indo-China by firmly supporting her ' freedom and placing the problem before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , " we have been presented with only a narrow set . of ugly choices . We . have been told that we can appease  --  which we will I not ; fight  --  which we hope will not be necessary ; or abandon the area to communism  --  which is unthinkable . " The people of Indo-China do not want communism  --  but they do want freedom . Let us return to the great American tradition and support that very natural desire by demonstrating in the clearest and frankest language possible that we want the States of Indo-China-to be free . " Accompanying Mr. Dulles on his mission Ito London and Paris are three of his chief aides : Douglas 2d , State Department counselor ; Livingston T. Merchant , Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs , and Walter S. Robertson , Assistant Secretary , of State for Far Eastern Affairs .
