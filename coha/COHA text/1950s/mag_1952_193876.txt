For the first time in their thousands of years of history , South Koreans last week elected a President by popular and secret ballot . President Syngman Rhee , 77 , got 5,238,769 of the 7,000,000 votes cast , without making a speech . On election day , the old man went to the polls with his loyal wife , an Austrian woman 20 years his junior whom he met in Geneva in 1932 , when he was fighting his country 's battles in the League of Nations . <P> The only other candidate with any considerable following was Lee Bum Suk , who had served Rhee ruthlessly well as Home Minister , and who was running for Vice President on Rhee 's ticket . Surprisingly enough , he lost . <P> He owed his defeat to President Rhee himself . Lee had been so effective in riding herd on the South Korean Assembly ( TIME , June 9 et . seq. ) , mobbing the Assembly with young hoodlums and arresting some of its members , that he came out of the battle with too much power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhee kicked him out of the Home Ministry and had police , block leaders and village elders pass the word to voters that Rhee 's favorite for the vice-presidency was not Lee , but a little-known politico of 82 ( some say he is 84 ) named Ham Dae Yung . Half a century ago , Rhee was condemned to death for political activities . Ham , then a young judge , commuted his sentence . Last week Rhee 's good friend Ham beat out Lee by 1,000,000 votes . <P> The true secrecy of the voting and the honesty of the count-attested to by U.N . observers-were encouraging , and to Westerners who still doubted it , the balloting demonstrated Syngman Rhee 's strong hold on the South Korean masses . He was strongest in rural areas . In Pusan , where South Koreans could see how Rhee " tyrannized " the National Assembly , the old hero-while beating his nearest opponent by 24,000-got only 45% of the vote .
