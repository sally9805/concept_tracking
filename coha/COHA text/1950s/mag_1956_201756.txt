Auntie Mame ( adapted from Patrick Dennis ' - novel by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee ) will likely be the favorite popular comedy of the season . It matters little that , far from being a sound play , Auntie Mame is really no play at all . For it will go fast and far on the inherent appeal of its chief character and the tremendous vivacity and skill of the gal who plays her . Everybody enjoys a lovable lunatic , and Rosalind Russell is a delight as the kindhearted madwoman of Beekman Place , bringing up her small nephew in a world of sidecars for breakfast , living herself in sumptuous dishabille , now marrying , now dispensing with marriage , now rescuing her nephew from a stuffy brand of it . <P> <P> Turning a sophisticated comic strip of a novel into an even broader but somewhat less vulgar play , the adapters-with wonderful help from Designer Oliver Smith-have hit on a kind of scene-a-minute technique . Their slapdash method , though highly uncreative , is not entirely illadvised . Thanks to Morton DaCosta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute for wit , and puts pedestrian writing on horseback . Its quick-changes also consort well with Auntie Mame 's scatterbrained nature , besides providing a fine succession of new costumes , new hairdos , new wall treatments , new gaffes , new predicaments and new men . <P> <P> Whatever her predicament or hairdo , Actress Russell remains the triumphant embodiment of festive pandemonium and soignee wackiness . Hers is a delightful twining of farceuse and comedienne : she can give a drawing-room inflection to a loony-bin situation , or turn daffy or profane in the midst of playing a grande dame . To wonderful good nature she adds a few drops of acidity-juice from a sun-kissed lemon . Though Auntie Mame is really a one-woman show , Peggy Cass deserves mention as an unmarried expectant mother , and Polly Rowles as a stage star who has always started sleeping it off when the party has scarcely begun . <P> <P> The Sleeping Prince ( by Terence Rattigan ) turns on his side now and then , and mumbles and stirs , but never once wakes up . Having given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playwright Rattigan here blindly scattereth poppy while contriving poppycock . His scene is the Carpathian legation in London at the time of George V 's coronation . His " occasional fairy tale " concerns a fetching young American chorus girl whom a Grand Duke invites for supper , and the night . But after a night rendered blameless by too much vodka , she stays on to meet and beguile the family , to go with the young King to a ball , with the Grand Duke 's wife to the Abbey , and at length with the Grand Duke into the next room . <P>
