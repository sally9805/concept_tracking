The day after Daniel F. ( for Francis ) McDevitt took office as Democratic mayor of Reading , Pa. last January , he made a florid announcement : he was going to drive out the gamblers . He gave pinball-machine operators 24 hours to get rid of some 1,000 " multi-coin " machines ( in which players can insert a number of nickels to boost payoff odds ) . But Mc-Devitt 's crusade was a resounding flop . After 19 days , in which three pinball distributors and two operators were arrested , he lifted the ban . His reason : the city ( pop . 114,200 ) could not legally outlaw the machines . But Daniel McDevitt warned citizens nevertheless that Reading 's 150-man force would maintain " sharp vigilance " to prevent gambling . Vowed the mayor : " We shall not permit the location of such devices near schools . " <P> The politically independent Reading Times ( circ. 36,911 ) found the sharp vigilance soon blunted . When newsmen last May found ten gambling machines within one block of three junior high schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed . But the Times reported that pinball machines were , if anything , more plentiful than ever . Fortnight ago , in his " Old Pete " column in the Times , City Editor Richard C. Peters , 36 , reported : " The old mob openly and brazenly admits that it shelled out half a million in ' restoring ' a situation to its liking . The mob admits that it has gotten back the half million . " <P> Reading Jail . Next day T-men called City Editor Peters , confided plans to raid Reading 's pinball-machine operators that afternoon for nonpayment of the $250 federal gambling tax . The Times covered the raid , broke out its 96-point head type next morning to banner City Hall Reporter Charles H. Kessler 's story on the seizure of 44 machines . Under a Page One picture of a raid on the Reading House tavern , the paper made a sharp note : the place had belonged to the mayor until his city hall job forced him to transfer ownership to a brother . <P> Danny McDevitt at first said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he soon changed his mind . One afternoon last week , when mild-mannered Reporter Kessler checked in at Reading 's grey old city hall , he found the second-floor pressroom locked ; the gold-and-black PRESS lettering on the door had been scraped off . When Reporter Kessler called the news to City Editor Peters , a photographer was sent over to take a gag picture of Kessler sitting forlornly on city hall steps with a typewriter in his lap . As Kessler headed back into city hall , he was intercepted by McDevitt and Police Chief Bernard F. Richards . " Lock him up , " said the mayor . The startled newsman was booked for disorderly conduct and packed off to a cell . Kessler 's fine , later appealed by the Times : $50.
