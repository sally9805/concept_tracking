" The American public is not going to stand for what we have been doing much longer , " said Kansas Farm Bureau President W. I. Boone last week . " The public is not going to keep on putting out money without getting results . " Like many another leader in the wheat-corn belt , Boone recognized that farmers have just about harvested their way to the end of public patience with a farm subsidy program that now costs a scandalous $6.6 billion a year and gets worse with each crop ( current Government-owned surplus : $9 billion ) . <P> Last month Boone 's own Kansas farm-bureau convention voted for the first time in its history to back a program 1 ) abolishing all acreage controls on wheat , 2 ) dropping price supports from today 's $1.80 to $1.30 per bu . Nebraska and Colorado farm-bureau conventions voted for similar programs , in effect backed the position of U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson and American Farm Bureau federation President Charles Shuman . <P> <P> The change , claimed its backers , would let wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out inefficient wheat producers . But chances are also good that the wheat states ' big commercial growers would sow record crops if freed from controls and promised $1.30 for every bushel , thus adding to the bulging surplus . <P> Hunting for some other way out , the surplus-surfeited corn belt shifted its sentiment toward tighter controls . The Illinois Farm Bureau , biggest in the nation , voted for an unprecedented plan of compulsory acreage retirement , a sort of unsubsidized soil bank , plus a subsidy-in-kind scheme that would hand out Government-owned surplus grain to farmers who grow even less than their allowances . Iowa farmers leaned in the same general direction , set the stage for a rough-and-tumble battle at the American Farm Bureau convention in Chicago next week . Though none of the farm organizations brought forth really promising ideas , ground was broken by the realization that , as Kansan Boone put it , " there is a lot more urgency than I have ever seen before .
