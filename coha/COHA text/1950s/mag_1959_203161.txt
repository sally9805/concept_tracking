When the medical world was agog over the discovery that blood circulates through the body , imaginative surgeons tried to transfuse sheep 's blood into human patients weakened by too generous bloodletting . Since they had never heard of such things as protein compatibility , it is small wonder that most patients died . In 1678 the French Parliament banned transfusions . Nowadays , no doctor would dream of transfusing animal blood to man . But last week , the medical world was again agog over a report that Italian physicians had used a sheep 's blood to help clear the system of a woman dying of mercury poisoning . <P> In London 's medical journal Lancet , Professors Michele Pavone-Macaluso and Antonino Anello described the case . Last winter a 34-year-old housewife bent on suicide swallowed bichloride of mercury . After eleven days , her system still could not flush out the poison . So with tubes from a vein and artery in one arm , the doctors hooked her up to an artificial kidney . But instead of letting her blood circulate through cellophane tubing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the poisons , they wheeled a donor into the treatment room . The donor : a 130-lb. ewe , heavily draped to conceal its identity . From a neck artery and vein the doctors hooked up the ewe to another cellophane tube . This was wrapped around the tube through which the patient 's blood circulated , and the two rested in a plasma solution to serve as an intermediary in the exchange . <P> The Sicilian doctors ' reasoning : a chemical cleansing bath is better than none , but it lacks so many of the factors usually found in blood that the patient loses some substances that are essential to life . Cellophane tubes of the type used in the artificial kidney will stop big protein molecules , so there should be no danger of a fatal antibody reaction . But they allow the blood 's complex chemicals to pass freely if they are fully dissolved . So the protein-free part of the woman 's poisoned plasma passed through both tube walls and into the sheep . <P> This " dialytic parabiosis " lasted 90 minutes , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The sheep also recovered after a brief feverish illness . ) Last week Dr. Pavone-Macaluso said that he wanted to try the technique again , but with a bigger donor animal-and hence a larger blood volume-to clear the patient 's blood faster . In fact , he said , if he could figure out a way to get it into the operating room , he would like to use an elephant .
