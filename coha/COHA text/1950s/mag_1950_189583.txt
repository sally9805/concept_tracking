The absurd and dangerous mockery of Communist Frdric Joliot-Curie at the head of France 's Atomic Research Commission ( TIME , April 17 ) came to an end last week . Premier Georges Bidault announced , " with regret , " the dismissal of the Red nuclear physicist . " Whatever the qualifications of this scientist , " said the Premier , " his public statements and his unreserved acceptance of the pro-Russian resolutions . . . of the Communist Party make it impossible to maintain him in his functions of High Commissioner . " <P> The dismissal of Joliot-Curie did not yet mean a security housecleaning in the Republic 's government . He had put a lot of his comrades on the Atomic Commission , and the government had made no move to oust them . France 's feeble government had not acted on its own initiative ; Bidault had merely reacted " with regret " to repeated kicks in the teeth by the Communist Party , which was , through a campaign of riots and threats , menacing the security of France .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
