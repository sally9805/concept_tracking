Is Britain 's frogman dead ? The Admiralty said it thought he was ( TIME , May 14 ) . If he died in some underwater accident , what became of his body ? Why had the Admiralty waited ten days before saying anything ? <P> Had the frogman been spying on the Soviet cruiser and destroyers lying in Portsmouth harbor ? What could he see underwater if he had been spying ? Had the Russians ( who brought Bulganin and Khrushchev to England ) caught the frogman and quietly taken him prisoner ? Had they done him in , or had they dumped his body at sea to save embarrassment ? <P> Furor at Home . Last week the fate of Frogman Lionel ( " Buster " ) Crabb , wartime hero in the Royal Navy , was giving Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden one of the most awkward times of his political career . In the House of Commons , Sir Anthony tried to dismiss the whole matter : " It would not be in the public interest to disclose the circumstances in which Commander Crabb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he added mysteriously : " I think it necessary , in the special circumstances of this case , to make it clear that what was done was done without the authority or the knowledge of Her Majesty 's Ministers . Appropriate disciplinary steps are being taken . " <P> His evasion did not dispel curiosity ; it doubled it . The obvious inference was that Commander Crabb had been employed by some secret arm of the government . Whatever the intelligence agency hoped to learn under the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze was plainly not worth the risk of being caught at it . The furor swelled . Britain 's Labor leaders had a special reason for pressing the attack . They were embarrassed by rank-and-file criticism that they had been unmannerly to B. &; K. at the famous dinner party ( TIME , May 7 ) and were anxious to convict Sir Anthony of even cruder mistreatment of his guests . They threatened a motion to cut Eden 's salary-a formal method of bringing a Minister 's personal competence into question . <P> At this point the Russians got crudely into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that the Kremlin had sent an official note to Whitehall concerning what Pravda called this " shameful espionage . " With a lack of diplomatic good manners , the Russians went on to quote their protest and the British reply . <P> This was their story : Russian seamen had spotted the frogman , wearing a black diving suit and flippers on his feet , at 7:30 one morning , floating between two Soviet destroyers . He stayed on the surface a minute or two . then dived under . The Russian admiral complained to the Portsmouth naval base commander , a rear admiral , who " categorically denied the possibility " of a British frogman in the area . " In actual fact , " said Moscow , Crabb 's secret activities have since been confirmed . The Foreign Office answer was a model of stiff-lipped embarrassment : " Commander Crabb carried out frogman tests , and , as is assumed , lost his life during these tests . His presence in the vicinity of the destroyers occurred without any permission whatever , and Her Majesty 's Government express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while not very edifying , was more informative than Eden had been in the House of Commons . Anthony Eden had more explaining to do .
