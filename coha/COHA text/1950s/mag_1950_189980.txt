For six months , President Truman had been unsuccessfully trying to land a man of stature as chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission . All the time , Connecticut 's Senator Brien McMahon kept nudging the presidential ribs and pointing admiringly at McMahon 's friend and former law partner , Gordon Dean . Last week Mr. Truman gave in to McMahon 's rib-poking . The White House announced that friendly , freckled Gordon Dean , a member of AEC since May 1949 , would be the new $17,500-a-year chief of the nation 's billion-dollar atomic energy program . <P> As chairman of Congress ' Joint Committee on Atomic Energy , Brien McMahon was in a fine spot to do a friend a favor . Dean was appointed to AEC in the first place at McMahon 's urging , was reappointed this year to a fresh three-year term . Seattle-born Gordon Dean , 44 , began his public career under McMahon 's wing . In 1934 , he quit teaching law at Duke University to become assistant to McMahon in the Justice Department 's Criminal Division ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice , quit to join McMahon 's Washington law firm . After the war , in which he served as a lieutenant in Naval Intelligence , Dean went back to teaching law ( at the University of Southern California ) until McMahon got him his job in AEC . <P> An assiduous and thoughtful workman who shuns the babble of Washington party going ( he plows through a briefcase full of documents every night at his Chevy Chase home ) , Dean is well-liked in the capital and on good terms with the powerful and ofttimes crotchety congressional Atomic Energy Committee . But as an administrator and a long-range policymaker , he is not regarded as the equal of David E. Lilienthal , who resigned the chairmanship in February after guiding AEC through its first tough three years . Nor is he considered as competent as outspoken Commissioner Sumner T. Pike , a Republican , who was renominated last week only after Brien McMahon assured the Senate that the President would not name Pike as chairman . <P> Under Lilienthal and the acting chairmanship of Pike , AEC had withstood political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captive of McMahon 's congressional committee . Now it might find its independence harder to keep .
