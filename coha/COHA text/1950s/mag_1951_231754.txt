For weeks before the running , the odds were on the Russians to sweep the field in Belgium 's first postwar revival of its violin international-the Concours Eugne Ysae , this year renamed for Queen Mother Elisabeth . There was a notable precedent : brilliant Soviet Violinist David Oistrakh ( TIME , Aug. 2 , 1948 ) won the grand prize in the first contest in 1937 . Moreover , the simple fact that the Russians entered meant that they were confident their violinists were good enough to win . <P> Last week the advance odds turned out to be right : the Russian favorites took first and second in a field of 26 of the world 's best young ( 15 to 30 ) performers . A Hungarian girl , who now lives in Switzerland , came third , a Dutchman fourth . <P> From the first preliminaries , there was little doubt among spectators or judges ( among them : Violinist Jacques Thibaud , Oistrakh himself ) as to the winner . Leonid Kogan , 26 , native of Dnepropetrovsk , sounded brilliantly above the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who survived the first high hurdles -a Bach sonata , a sonata by Ysae , the great Belgian violinist ( 1858-1931 ) , two concertos and six pieces of the contestants ' choosing . <P> Between the preliminaries and the finals , the Russians stuck strictly to business , practiced hard . In the quiet music academy outside Brussels where the finalists were lodged , the Russians rose at 6 , often started playing before breakfast . Said Houston , Tex . Violinist Fredell Lack , 29 : " And you could hear them still going at night when the rest of us went to bed . " Exasperated Dutchman Theo Olaf finally complained : " Is it absolutely necessary for you to practice until the middle of the night ? " The Russians , who had been aloof at first but warmed up a bit when they asked for borsch and got a Belgian version of it , agreed to cut out some of their night work . <P> The audiences at the finals vigorously applauded all the ultimate prizewinners , including Second Prizewinner Mikhail Vayman , 24 , Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the biggest crowd came out on the last afternoon for Leonid Kogan . By the time he had glided masterfully through the perilous Paganini Concerto in D Major , the Bruxellois were yelling bravo . Kogan grinned , bowed quickly and walked off into a flood of backstage congratulations . The judges ' decision an hour later confirmed what everyone already knew : Kogan had won hands down . <P> His prize : 150,000 Belgian francs ( $2,970 ) , a prearranged 65-concert tour of Western Europe . <P> At week 's end , Brussels music lovers got a rare dividend : a performance by the great David Oistrakh himself . Wearing his Stalin Prize medal , 42-year-old Oistrakh hypnotized them with a splendid playing of Bach 's double concerto ( with Belgian Violinist Arthur Grumiaux ) . At the end , the audience , including Queen Mother Elisabeth , stood and gave a four-minute ovation to the man who is Russia 's finest violinist , and surely one of the finest in the world . It was his first performance in Western Europe in 14 years .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
