" Caius said , a whining note in his voice . " Why should n't I be a child ? Is it so rewarding to be grown ? " " But why did you hate Spartacus so when you never saw him ? " " Maybe I did see him . You know , I went to Capua four years ago . I was only twenty-one then , I was very young . " " You are still very young , " the general said . " No  --  I do n't feel so young . But then I was . A party of five or six of us went . Marius Bracus took me with him , he was very fond of me " Caius said that deliberately for the effect it would have ; Marius Bracus had died in the Servile War , so there would be no question of current involvement , but let  | Crassus know that he was not the only one and not the first one .

" " Did you care for him greatly ? " " I was sorry he died , " Caius shrugged , and the general thought , " What a little animal you are ! What a filthy little animal ! " " Anyway , we went to Capua and Bracus promised us a special circus , which was more expensive then than now . You had to be a rich man to do it in Capua . " " Lentulus Batiatus had the school there then , did n't he ? " asked Crassus . " He did , and it was supposed to be the best school anywhere in Italy . The best and the most expensive , and you could buy an elephant for what it cost to fight a pair of his boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was a pig in any case . Did you know him ? " Crassus shook his head . " Tell me about him , I 'm very interested . It was before Spartacus broke loose , was n't it ? " " Eight days before , I think . Yes , Batiatus made a name for himself because he kept a regular harem of slave women and people do n't like that sort of thing . Not out in the open . It 's all right if you do it in a room with the doors closed , but it 's rather tasteless to do it on a public highway . That 's practically what he did . Also , he used his boys for stud and the women for breeding , which is all right , I suppose , but he did n't know how to do anything delicately .

" 51  | " The things you remember ! " the general smiled . " I remember that . I went to see him with Bracus , and Bracus wanted two turns to the death ; but Batiatus was reluctant to do it . Batiatus said that there was no point trying to develop anything in the way of style or technique or precision play when every rich and bored gentleman in Rome came down for his own particular circus . But Bracus had a purse , and money talks . " " " It talks with that kind , " said the general . " All lanistae are contemptible , but this Batiatus was a pig . You know , he owns three of the biggest tenements in Rome , and a fourth that fell in last year , and half his tenants were killed in the rubbish . He 'll do anything for money .

I do n't want you ever to say that ! " Like a cat , Caius tensed and bristled . " Now what have I said to anger you so ? " the general soothed him . " You want me to tell you about Batiatus ? It 's of no great interest , but j will if you want me to . It was over a year ago , I think , and We were being clawed badly by the slaves . That was why I wanted to find out about this Spartacus . You know a man , and it 's easier to beat him . . . " Caius smiled as he listened . He did n't wholly know why he hated Spartaeus so much ; but sometimes he found a deeper satisfaction in hatred than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Crassus , the great general , told to Caius Crassus , concerning a visit to his encampment by Lentulus Batiatus , who kept a school for gladiators in Capua . ( This , then , said Crassus , as he lay beside the young man , happened shortly after I had been given the command  --  the kind of an honor that you take with you to a quick grave . The slaves had torn our legions to shreds , and to all effects and purposes , they ruled Italy . This , they told me to rescue . Go out and defeat the slaves , they said . My worst enemies honored me . I had encamped my troops in Cis-Alpine Gaul then , and I sent out a message for your fat friend , Lentulus Batiatus . ) And rain was falling lightly as Lentalus Batiatus approached the camp of Crassus . The whole landscape was miserable and desolate , and he was also desolate , being a long way from home and from the warm sunshine of Capua . Not even the comfort of a litter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking : " When military men take over , honest men dance to the strings they pull . Your life is no longer your own .

But if you are neither of them , only an honest man who made his money honestly , you can never lay your head down in peace . If you are not bribing an inspector , you 're paying off a ward heeler ; and if you 're rid of both , you have a Tribune on your payroll . And every time you wake up , you 're surprised you were n't knifed in your sleep . And now a damned general does me the honor of dragging me halfway across Italy  --  to ask me questions . If my name was Crassus or Gracchus or Silenus , or Menius , it would be a very different story indeed . That 's Roman justice and Roman equality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained a series of uncomplimentary thoughts concerning Roman justice and a certain Roman general . In these thoughts , he was interrupted by a sharp interrogation from road guards stationed before the encampment . He halted his horse obediently and sat there in the cold , fine rain while two troopers advanced and examined him . Since they had to stand in the rain anyway for their time on guard , they were in no haste to relieve his discomfort . They examined him coldly and unpleasantly and asked him who he was . " My name is Lentulus Batiatus . " Because they were ignorant peasants , they did n't recognize the name , and they wanted to know wh3re he thought he was going . " This road leads to the camp , does n't it ? " " It does . " " Well , I 'm going to the camp . " " For what ? " " To speak with the commander . " " Just like that . What are you selling ? " " Why , the dirty bastards ! " thought Batiatus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling nothing . I 'm here by invitation . "  | " Whose invitation ? " " The commander 's . " And he went into his wallet and brought out the order Crassus had sent him . They could n't read , but even a piece of paper was sufficient to pass him on , and he was allowed to walk his yellow nag down the military road to the encampment . Like so many other rising citizens of that time , Batiatus assessed everything in terms of money ; and he could not help wondering , as he proceeded , what it would cost to build this kind of a road  --  a temporary road just thrown down for the convenience of the encampment , but nevertheless a better road than he was able to build as an approach to his school at Capua . On a dirt and gravel base , easily-cut slabs of sandstone were laid , a whole mile of it straight as an arrow to the encampment . " If these cursed generals would think more of fighting and less of roads , we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time he glowed a 4ittle with pride . You had to admit that even in a dirty , rainy , miserable hole like this , Roman civilization made itself felt . No question about that . Now he was approaching the encampment . As always , the temporary stopping place of the legions was like a city ; where the legions went , civilization went ; and where the legions camped , if only for a night , civilization arose . Here was a mighty , walled area , almost half a mile square , laid out as precisely as a draftsman might lay out a diagram on his drawing board . First there was a ditch , twelve feet wide and twelve feet deep ; behind this ditch was a heavy log palisade , twelve feet high . The road crossed the ditch to the entrance , where heavy wooden gates opened at his approach . A trumpeter sounded him in , and a maniple revolved around him as he entered . It was no tribute to him , but discipline for the sake of discipline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the world had there been troops so disciplined as the legions . Even Batiatus , with his own enormous love of blood-  | letting and fighting  --  and thereby his inherent contempt for the drafted soldier  --  was impressed by the machine-like precision of everything connected with the army . It was not simply the road or the palisade or the ditch , two miles in length , or the broad streets of the encampment-city , or the drainage ditches , or the sandstone pavement laid in the center of the streets , or the whole multiple life and motion and order of this Roman encampment of thirty thousand men ; but rather the knowledge that this mighty production of man 's reason and effort was the casual nightly effort of the legions in motion . It was not lightly said that barbarians were more easily defeated by seeing a legion encamp for the night than by going into battle with one . As Batiatus dismounted , rubbing his fat behind where it had too long and too intimate contact with the saddle , a young officer came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was . " Lentulus Batiatus of Capua . " " Oh , yes  --  yes , " the young man drawled , a young fellow of no more than twenty , a pretty one , a scented , groomed product of one of the best families . The kind Batiatus hated most . " Yes , " said the young man . " Lentulus Batiatus of Capua . " He knew ; he knew all about Lentulus Batiatus of Capua and who he was and what he represented and why he had been summoned here to the army of Crassus . " Yes , " thought Batiatus , " you hate me , do n't you , you little son of a bitch , and you stand there despising me ; but you come to me and you whine to me and you buy from me , and it 's your kind that makes me what I am ; but you 're too good to come close to me , because you might be soiled by my breath , you little bastard ! " That he thought , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the young man nodded . " The commander has been expecting you . I know that . He wants you to come to him immediately . I 'll take you there . "  | " I want to rest  --  eat something . " " The commander will see to that . He 's a very thoughtful man , " the young officer smiled , and then snapped at one of the soldiers , " Take his horse and water it and feed it and bed it down ! " " I have n't eaten anything since breakfast , " said Batiatus , and it seems to me that if your commander has waited this long , he can wait a while longer . " The eyes of the young man narrowed , but he kept his voice pleasant and observed , " That 's for him to say . " " You feed the horse first ? " The young officer smiled and nodded . " Come along , " he said . " I 'm not in your damned legion ! " " You 're in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ; then Batiatus shrugged , decided that there was no point in continuing the argument there in that needle-like rain , wrapped his wet cloak around him , and followed what he characterized as a dirty little patrician snotnose  --  but to himself , thinking too that , after all , he had seen more blood run in a single afternoon than this whelp , whose mother 's milk was scarcely dry on his lips , had seen in all his fancy military career . But think what he might , the fat man remained as a small butcher in a slaughterhouse ? his only comfort being a knowledge that he was not entirely apart from the forces which had brought the legions to this place . He followed the young man down the broad central avenue of the encampment , looking curiously from side to side at the dirty , mud-stained tents , good enough as roofs but open in front , and at the soldiers who sprawled on their grass beds , talking , swearing , singing and throwing dice or knuckle-bones . They were hard , clean-shaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tents had little stoves , but generally they took the cold as they took the heat , as they  | took the endless drill and the merciless discipline , the weak among them dying quickly , the tough ones becoming tougher and tougher , steel and whalebone attached to a small , efficient knife , which had become the most dreadful instrument of mass destruction ever known . Directly in the center of the camp , at an intersection of two lines stretched between the four corners , stood the general 's pavilion , the praetorium , which was merely a large tent divided into two sections or rooms . The flaps of this tent were closed , and on either side of the entrance stood a sentry , each of whom carried a long , slender dress spear instead of the heavy and murderous pilum , and a light , circular buckler and curved knife in the Thracean style , instead of the regular massive shield and Spanish shortsword . They wore white woolen cloaks which were sodden with rain , and stood as if they were carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clothes and their weapons . For some reason this impressed Batiatus mote than anything else he had seen . He was pleased when flesh did more than flesh was calculated to do , and this pleased him . As they approached , the sentries saluted and then held the flaps aside . Batiatus and the young officer passed through , into the dim light of the tent , and Batiatus found himself in a room forty feet in width and some twenty in depth , the front half of the praetorium . Its only furnishings consisted of a long wooden table with a dozen folding stools set around it . At one end of the table , elbows upon it , staring at a map that was spread out in front of him , sat the commander in chief , Marcus Licinius Crassus . Crassus rose as Batiatus and the officer entered , and the fat man was pleased to note how readily the general walked forward , giving him his hand in greeting . " Lentulus Batiatus  --  of Capua ? I imagine so . " Batiatus nodded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with fine , strong manly features and nothing condescending about him . " I 'm happy to meet you , sir , " said Batiatus . " You 've come a long way , and very decently , and very good of you too , I 'm sure , and you 're wet and hungry and tired . " He said this with concern and a certain misgiving , which put Batiatus at his ease ; the young officer , however , continued to regard the fat man as superciliously as before . If Batiatus had been more sensitive he would have realized that both attitudes were equally meaningful . The general had a program of work before him ; the young officer maintained the attitude of a gentleman toward such as Batiatus . " I amen of that , " answered Batiatus . " Wet and tired , but most of all starved to death . I asked this young man whether I could eat , but he thought it was an unreasonable request . " " We are conditioned to follow orders very precisely , " said Crassus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as you came . Now , of course , your every wish will be mine to please . I am quite conscious of what an arduous journey you had here . Dry clothes , of course  --  immediately . Do you want a bath ? " " The bath can wait . I want to put something between my ribs . " Smiling , the young officer left the tent . II They had finished with broiled fish and baked eggs , and now Batiatus was devouring a chicken , breaking it apart and cleaning every bone thoroughly . At the same time , he dipped regularly into a wooden bowl of porridge and washed the food down with huge draughts from a beaker of wine . The chicken and porridge and wine smeared his mouth ; bits of food were already dirtying the clean tunic Crassus had given him ; and his hands were greasy with chicken fat .  | Crassus watched him with interest . As with so many Romans of his class and generation , he had a particularized social contempt for the lanista , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold them and hired them out for the arena . It was only in the past twenty years that the lanistae had become a power in Rome , a political and financial power , and frequently men of enormous wealth , such as this fat , gross man who sat at the table here with him . Only a generation ago , arena fighting was an intermittent and not too important feature of society . It had always been present ; it was more popular with certain elements , less popular with others . Then , suddenly , it had become the rage of Rome . Everywhere , arenas were built . The smallest town had its wooden arena for fights . The fighting of one pair turned into the fighting of a hundred pairs , and a single set of games would go on for a month . And instead of reaching a point of satiation , the lust of the public grew seemingly without end . Cultured Roman matrons and street hoodlums took equal interest in the games . A whole new language of the games had arisen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public dole anddthe games , and ten thousand workless , homeless citizens lived for no other apparent reason than to watch the games . Suddenly , the market in gladiators was a seller 's market , and the gladiatorial schools came into being . The school at Capua , which Lentulus Batiatus operated , was one of the largest and most prosperous . Just as the cattle from certain latifundia were desired in every market place , so were the gladiators of Capua esteemed and desired in every arena . And from a street man , a third rate ward heeler , Batiatus had become a rich man and one of the most notable trainers of bustuarii in all Italy . " Yet , " thought Crassus as he watched him , " he is still a street man , still a crafty , vulgar , scheming animal . See how he eats ! " It was always difficult for Crassus to comprehend how so very many poorly-born and ill-mannered men had more money  | than many of his friends could ever hope to have . Certainly , they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew his own value as a military man ; he had the Roman virtues of thoroughness and doggedness , and he did not look upon military tactics as something that came to one instinctively . He had studied every campaign recorded , and he had read all the best of the Greek historians . Nor did he make  --  as every previous general in this war had made  --  the mistake of underestimating Spartacus . Yet he sat here across the table from this gross man and in some curious way , he felt inferior . He shrugged and said to Batiatus , " You must understand that I have no feelings about Spartacus in relation to yourself , oP the war either , for that matter . I am not a moralist . I had to talk to you because you can tell me what no other can . " " And just what is that ? " asked Batiatus . " The nature of my enemy . " The fat man poured more wine and squinted at the general . A sentry entered the tent and placed two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the light of the lamps , Lentulus Batiatus was a different person . Twilight had been kind to him . Now the light roved up on his face as he massaged it with a napkin , hooking slabs of shadow over the pendulous layers of flesh . His large flat nose quivered constantly and incongruously , and bit by bit , he was getting tight . A cold glint in his eyes told Crassus not to misjudge him , not to think that this was an amiable fool . No fool indeed . " What do I know of your enemy ? " Trumpets sounded outside . Evening drill had finished , and the roll of leather-shod feet on the double rocked the encampment . " I have only one enemy . Spartacus is my enemy , " Crassus said carefully .  | The fat man blew his nose into his napkin . " And you know Spartacus , " Crassus said . " I do , by God ! " " No one else . Just you . No one who ever fought Spartacus knew him . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpets , beat their drums , cast their pilum  --  and then the slaves were to run away . No matter how many times the legions were torn to shreds , they still expected that . What was could n't be , and so today Rome makes the last effort and if it fails , there will be no Rome . You know that as well as I do . " The fat man roared with laughter . He held his belly and rocked back on his stool . " You find it funny ? " Crassus asked . " The truth is always funny . " Crassus contained himself and his temper and waited for the laughter to subside . " There will be no Rome  --  there will only be Spartacus . " The fat man had subsided to a giggle now , and Crassus , watching him , wondered whether he was quite in his right mind , or only drunk . What things a land produced ! Here was the lanista , who bought slaves and trained them to fight ; of course , he was laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight . " You should hang me , not feed me , " Batiatus whispered ingratiatingly , pouring another glass of wine for himself . " I would have a dream , " said the general , pulling the conversation back to his own needs , " a sort of nightmare . One of those dreams that one has over and over again ? " Batiatus nodded understandingly. ? and in this dream I would fight with my eyes bandaged . That is horrible , but logical . You see , I do n't believe that all dreams are omens . Certain dreams are simply reflections of the problems one faces when awake . Spartacus is the un-  | known . If I go to battle with him , my eyes are bandaged . That is n't the case in any other circumstances . I know why the Gauls fight ; I know why the Greeks and the Spaniards and the Germans fight . They fight for the same reasons  --  with natural variations  --  that I do . But I do n't know why this slave fights . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filth and sweepings of the whole world , and uses them to destroy the best troops the world has ever known . It takes five years to make a legionary  --  five years to make him understand that his life is of no consequence , that the legion and only the legion counts , that an order must be obeyed , any order . Five years of training , ten hours a day , every day ? and then you can take them to a cliff and order them to march over the edge and they will obey . And yet these slaves have destroyed the best legions of Rome . " That is why I asked you to come here from Capua  --  to tell me about Spartacus . So I can take the bandage away from my eyes . " Batiatus nodded somberly . He was mellowing now . He was the confidant and adviser of great generals , and that was as it should be . " Firstly , " said Crassus , " there is the man . Tell me about him . What does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Men never look like what they are . " " True  --  profoundly true , and when you realize that , you know about men . " Which was the very best flattery to offer Batiatus . " He was gentle , so gentle , almost humble , and he 's a Thracian ; that much about him is true . " Batiatus dipped one finger in his wine and tallied his points on the table . " They say he is a giant  --  no , no , not at all . He 's no giant . He 's not even particularly tall . About your height , I would say . Black , curly hair ; dark brown eyes . His nose was broken ; otherwise , I guess , you would call him handsome . But the broken nose  | gave a sheep-like expression to his face . A broad face , and gentle , and all of this deceived you . I would have killed anyone else who did what he did . " " What did he do ? " asked Crassus . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must have a frank picture , " Crassus said slowly . " I want you to know that everything you say to me will be held in the strictest confidence . " He laid aside for the moment the specific incident for which Batiatus would have killed Spartacus . " I also want to know his background  --  where did you buy him and what was he ? " " What is a gladiator ? " smiled Batiatus , spreading his hands . " Not just a slave , you understand  --  or at least the gladiators of Capua are not just slaves . They are special . If you fight dogs , you do not buy house pets that are reared by little girls . If you fight men , you want men who will fight . Men who chew their gall . Men who hate . Men with spleen . So I inform the agents that I am in the market for men with spleen . That kind are no good for house slaves and they are no good on the latifundia either . " " Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a man is broken , I do n't want him . And if you ca n't break a man , you must kill him , but you ca n't work him . He spoils the work . He spoils the others who work . He is like a disease . " " Then why will he fight ? " " Ah  --  and there you have the question , and if you ca n't answer that question , you ca n't work with gladiators . In the old days , they called the arena fighters bustuarii , and those fought for the love of fighting , and they were sick in the head , and there were only a few of them , and they were not slaves . " He touched his head meaningfully . " No one wants to fight to the blood unless he is sick here . No one likes it .  | The gladiator does n't like to fight . He fights because you give him a weapon and take off his chains .

And then it 's your wit against his wit , because he is a devil , so you have to be a devil too . " " And where do you find such men ? " asked Crassus , intrigued and captured by the flat , straightforward account of a man who knew his trade . " There is only one place where you can find them  --  the kind I want . Only one place . The mines . It must be the mines . They must come from a place compared to which the legion is paradise , the latifundia is paradise , and even the gallows is a blessed mercy . That is where my agents find them . That is where they found Spartacus  --  and he was koruu . Do you know what that word means ? It is an Egyptian word , I think . " Crassus shook his head . " It means three generations of slaves . The grandson of a slave . In the Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A crawling beast .

Then why ? " He was drunk . He was full of pity for himself , this fat trainer of gladiators who kept the school at Capua . His soul came forth ; even a fat and dirty pig who has a lulus where the sand turns into stuffing for blood sausage has a soul . " And Spartacus was koruu , " said Crassus softly .

Why do I live with loneliness ? What right have you to look down on me ? Your life is your life . Mine is mine . " " You are my honored guest . I do n't look down on you , " said Crassus . Batiatus smiled and leaned toward him . " Do you know what I want ? Do you know what I need ? We are two men of the world , both of us . I need a woman . Tonight .

" III So it was that before there was a Christian hell in books and sermons  --  and perhaps afterwards too ? there was a hell on earth that men saw and looked at and knew well indeed . For it is the nature of man that he can only write of the hells he has first created himself . In the month of July , when it is dry and awful , go up the Nile from Thebes . Go up to the First Cataract . Already you are in the devil 's own land . See how the ribbon of green along the riverside has shrunk and withered ! See how the hills and mounds of the desert have changed to a finer and  | finer sand . Smoke and powder ; the wind touches it and it bursts up here and it throws out tentacles there . Where the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a crust of white powder lies upon it . The powder is in the air too , and it is already very hot . But at least there is a little wind in this place . Now you have passed the First Cataract , and you must strike out into the Nubian Desert , which lies southward and eastward . Go into the desert far enough to lose the little wind that survived over the river , but not far enough to catch even a breath of breeze from the Red Sea . And now go southward . Suddenly , the wind is still and the earth is dead . Only the air is alive , and the air is glazed with heat and shimmering with heat , and man 's senses are no longer valid , for he sees nothing as it is , but everything bent and warped and curved by the heat . And the desert has changed too . It is a mistaken notion many people hold that desert is everywhere the same ; but desert means only a lack of water , and this lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies too according to the nature of the soil or landscape where the desert is .

Here , there grows nothing at all . Not the dry , twisted , tough shrubbery of the rock desert ; not the lonely tumbleweeds of the sand desert , but nothing at all . Go into this desert then . Plod through the white powder and feel how wave after wave of the dreadful heat beats down upon your back . As hot as it can be and yet allow a man to live , so is it here . Make a track through this hot and terrible desert , and time and space become boundless and monstrous . But you go on and on and on and on . What is hell ?

Now it is frightful to walk , to breathe , to see , to think . But this does not go on forever . Suddenly , it is delineated , and the further aspect of hell appears . Black ridges show ahead of you , strange , nightmarish black ridges . This is the black stone escarpment . You go on toward the black stone , and then you see that it is streaked through and through with veins of shining white marble . Oh , how bright this marble is ! Oh , how it gleams and shines and with what heavenly lustre ! But it must have a heavenly lustre , for the streets of heaven are paved with gold , and the white marble is rich with gold . That is why men came to this place , and that is why you are coming here , because the marble is rich and heavy with gold . Go closer and see . It was long ago that the Egyptian Pharaohs discovered this black rock escarpment , and in those days they had only tools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the surface , but little more . But after generations of scratching at the surface , the gold gave out and it was necessary to go into the black rock and cut away the white marble . This was made possible because the age of copper was past and the age of iron had come , and now men could work the marble with picks and iron wedges and eighteen-pound sledges . But a new kind of man was needed . The heat and the dust and the physical contortions necessary to follow the twisting gold-bearing , veins in ; . o the rock made it impossible to employ peasants either from Ethiopia or from Egypt , and the ordinary slave cost too much and died too quickly . So to this place were brought war-hardened soldiers taken captive and children who were koruu , bred from slaves who were bred from slaves in a process where only the toughest and the hardest could survive . And children were needed ,  | for when the veins narrowed , deep inside the black rock escarpment , only a child could work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed away and the purses of the Greek kings of Egypt dwindled ; the hand of Rome lay over them and the slave dealers of Rome took over the operation of the mines . In any case , no one but Romans knew how to work slaves properly . So you come to the mines as Spartacus did , one hundred and twenty-two Thracians chained neck to neck , carrying their burning hot chains across the desert all the way from the First Cataract . The twelfth man from the front of the line is Spartacus . He is almost naked , as they all are almost naked , and soon he will be entirely naked . He wears a shred of a lotI cloth , and his hair is long and he is bearded , just as every man in the line is long-haired and bearded . His sandals have worn through , but he wears the little that is left of them for what protection it may offer ; for though the skin of his feet is a quarter of an inch thick and as tough as leather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is he like , this man Spartacus ? He is twenty-three years old as he carries his chain across the desert , but it is not marked on him ; for his kind , there is an agelessness of toil , no youth and no manhood and no growing old , but only the agelessness of toil . From head to foot and hair and beard and face , he is covered with the powdery white sand , but underneath the sand his skin is burned brown as his dark , intense eyes , which peer out of his cadaverous face like hateful coals . The brown skin is an adjunct of life for such as he ; the white-skinned , yellow-haired slaves of the Northlands can not work in the mines ; the sun fries them and kills them , and they pass away in bitter pain . Tall or short is hard to say , for men in chains do not walk erect , but the body is whipcord , sun-jerked meat , dry  | and waterless but not fleshless . For so many generations there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stony hills of Thrace the living was never easy , so that what survived is hard and with a tight clutch on life . The handful of wheat upon which he feeds each day , the flat , hard barley cakes are sucked dry of every shied of sustenance and the body is young enough to sustain itself . The neck is thick and muscular , but there are festering sores where the bronze collar rests . The shoulders are padded with muscle , and so equal are the proportions of the body that the man looks smaller than he is . The face is broad , and because the nose was broken once by the blow of an overseer 's rod , it appears flatter than it actually is , and since the dark eyes are wide-set , it takes on a gentle , sheep-like expression . Under the beard and the dust , the mouth is large and full-lipped , sensuous and sensitive , and if the lips move back  --  in a grimace , not in a smile  --  you see that the teeth are white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beautiful as some hands can be ; indeed , the only thing about him that is beautiful is his hands . This , then , is Spartacus , the Thracian slave , the son of a slave who was the son of a slave . No man knows his destiny , and the future is not a book to be read , and even the past ? when the past is toil and nothing else but toil  --  can dissolve into a murky bed of various pain . This , then , is Spartacus , who does not know the future and has no cause to remember the past , and it has never occurred to him that those who toil shall ever do other than toil , nor has it occurred to him that there will ever be a time when men do not toil with the lash across their backs . What does he think of as he plods across the hot sand ? Well , it should be known that when men carry a chain , they think of little , of very little , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than when you will eat again , drink  | again , sleep again . So there are not complex thoughts in the mind of Spartacus or in the minds of any of his Thracian comrades who carry the chain with him . You make men like beasts and they do not think of angels . But now it is the end of a day and the scene is changing , and men like these clutch at little bits of excitement and change . Spartacus looks up , and there is the black ribbon of the escarpment . There is a geography of slaves , and though they do not know the shape of the seas , the height of the mountains or the course of the rivers , they know well enough of the silver mines of Spain , the gold mines of Arabia , the iron mines of North Africa , the copper mines of the Caucasus and the tin mines of Gaul . There is their own lexicon of horror , their own refuge in knowledge of another place worse than where they are ; but worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide world . Spartacus looks at it ; the others look at it , and the whole line halts its plodding , painful motion , and the camels with their burden of water and wheat also halt , even as do the overseers with their whips and their pikes . Everyone looks at the black ribbon of hell . And then the line goes on . The sun is sinking behind the black rock when they reach it , and it has become blacker , more savage , more ominous . It is the end of the day 's work and the slaves are emerging from the shafts . " What are they , what are they ? " thinks Spartacus . And the man behind him whispers , " God help me ! " But God will not help him here . God is not here ; what would God be doing here ? And then Spartacus realizes that these things he sees are not some strange species of the desert , but men like himself and children such as he was once . That is what they are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from without ; and to those forces which shaped them into something other than humankind ,  | there has been an inner response , a fading away of the desire or need to be human . Just see them  --  see them ! The heart of Spartacus , which has become in the process of years like a stone , begins to contract with fear and horror . The wells of pity in him , which he believes to be dried up , are wet again , and his dehydrated body is still capable of tears . He looks at them . The whip lays on his back for him to move on , but still he stands and looks at them . They have been crawling in the shafts , and now when they come out , they still crawl like animals . They have not bathed since they are here , nor will they ever bathe again . Their skins are patchworks of black dust and brown dirt ; their hair is long and tangled , and when they are not children , they are bearded . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference now is so little that one hardly remarks upon it . They all have ugly calluses on knees and elbows , and they are naked , completely naked . Why not ? Will clothes keep them alive longer ? The mine has only one purpose , to bring profits to the Roman stockholders , and even shreds of dirty cloth cost something . Yet they wear an article of clothing . Each has upon his neck a bronze or an iron collar , and as they come crawling down the black rock , the overseers snap each collar onto a long chain , and when there are twenty chained together , they plod to their quarters . It must be noted that no one ever escaped from the Nubian mines ; no one could escape . A year in these mines , and how can one ever belong to the world of men again ? The chain is a symbol more than a need . Spartacus stares at them and seeks for his own kind , his own race , the humankind , which is race and kind when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says to himself , " talk to each other . " But they do not talk . They are silent as death . " Smile , " he pleads to himself . But no one smiles . They carry their tools with them , the iron picks , crowbars  | and chisels . Many of them have crude lamps strapped onto their heads . The children , skinny as spiders , twitch as they walk and constantly blink at the light . These children never grow up ; they are good for two years at the most , after they come to the mines , but there is no other way to follow the gold-bearing stone when the veins narrow and twist . They carry their chains by the Thracians , but they never even turn their heads to look at the newcomers . They have no curiosity . They do n't care . And Spartacus knows . " In a little while , I will not care , " he says to himself . And this is more frightening than anything else . Now the slaves go to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock shelter , which is their barracks , is built against the base of the escarpment itself . It was built a long , long time ago . No one can remember when it was built . It is built of massive slabs of rough-hewn black stone , and there is no light inside , and ventilation only from the opening at each end . It has never been cleaned . The filth of decades has rotted on its floor and hardened on its floor . The overseers never enter the place . If there should be trouble inside , then food and water are withheld ; when they have been long enough without food and water , the slaves become docile and crawl out like the animals they are . When someone dies inside , the slaves bring the body out . But sometimes a little child will die deep inside the long barracks , and it will not be noticed and he will not be missed until the corruption of his body reveals him . That is the kind of a place the barracks is . The slaves go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unchained and given a wooden bowl of food and a leathern jack of water . The jack contains a little less than a quart of water , and this is their ration twice a day . But two quarts of water a day is not enough to replace what the heat takes in so dry a place , and thus the slaves are subjected to a gradual  | process of progressive dehydration . If other things do not kill them , sooner or later this destroys their kidneys and when the pain is too bad for them to work , they are driven out to the desert to die . All these things , Spartacus knows . The knowledge of slaves is his , and the community of slaves is his . He was born into it ; he grew in it ; he matured in it . He knows the essential secret of slaves . It is a desire  --  not for pleasure , comfort , food , music , laughter , love , warmth , women or wine , not for any of those things  --  it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no more , to survive . He does not know why . There is no reason to this survival , no logic to this survival ; but neither is the knowledge an instinct . It is more than an instinct . No animal could survive this way ; the pattern for survival is not simple ; it is not an easy thing ; it is far more complex and thoughtful and difficult than all of the problems faced by people who never confront this one . And there is a reason for it too . It is just that Spartacus does not know the reason . Now he will survive . He is adapting , flexing , conditioning , acclimatizing , sensitizing ; he is a mechanism of profound fluidity and flexibility . His body conserves strength from the freedom of release from the chain . How long he and his comrades carried that chain , across the sea , up the River Nile , across the desert ! Weeks and weeks of the chain , and now he is free of it ! He is light as a feather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He accepts his water  --  more water than he has seen in weeks . He will not gulp it and piss it out in waste . He will guard it and sip at it for hours , so that every possible drop of it may sink into the tissues of his body . He takes his food , wheat and barley gruel cooked with dry locusts . Well , there is strength and life in dry locusts , and wheat and barley are the fabric of his flesh . He has eaten worse , and all food must be honored ; those who dishonor food , even in thought , become enemies of food , and soon they die .  | He walks into the darkness of the barracks , and the fetid wave of rotten smell claws at his senses . But no man dies of a smell , and only fools or free men can afford the luxury of vomiting . He will not waste an ounce of the contents of his stomach in such a fashion . He will not fight this smell ; such things can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he will welcome it and let it seep into him and soon it will have no terrors for him . He walks in the dark , and his feet guide him . His feet are like eyes . He must not trip or fall , for in one hand he carries food and in the other , water . Now he guides over to the stone wall and sits down with his back against it . It is not so bad here . The stone is cool and he has support for his back . He eats and drinks . And all around him are the movements and breathing and chewing of other men and children who do exactly as he does , and within him the expert organs of his body help him and expertly extract what they need from the little food and little water . He picks the last grain of food from his bowl , drinks down what is left , and licks the inside of the wood . He is not conditioned by appetite ; food is survival ; every small speck and stain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of those who have eaten are more content and others give way to despair . Not all despair has vanished from this place ; hope may go , but despair clings more stubbornly , and there are groans and tears and sighs , and somewhere there is a wavering scream . And there is even a little talk , and a broken voice which calls , " Spartacus  --  where are you ? " " Here , I am here , Thracian , " he answers . " Here is the Thracian , " another voice says . " Thracian , Thracian . " They are his people , and they gather around him . He feels their hands as they press close to him . Perhaps the other slaves listen , and in any case , they are deeply silent . It is only the due of newcomers in hell . Perhaps those who came here earlier are remembering now what mostly they fear to  | remember . Some understand the words of the Attic tongue and others do n't . Perhaps somewhere , even , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed , blessed coolness , the brooks running through the pine forests and the black goats leaping among the rocks . Who knows what memories persist among the damned people of the black escarp-ment ? " Thracian , " they call him , and now he feels them on every side , and when he stretches out a hand he feels the face of one of them , all covered with tears . Ah , tears are a waste . " Where are we , Spartacus , where are we ? " one of them whispers . " We are not lost . We remember how we came . " " Who will remember us ? " " We are not lost , " he repeats . " But who will remember us ? " One can not talk in such a fashion . He is like a father to them . For men twice his years , he is a father in the old tribal way . They are all Thracians , but he is the Thracian . So he chants to them softly , like a father telling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where churning water broke , In close array before the western wind , Churning finely up from the ocean deeps , And arching as it breaks upon the land , Its white foam spewing hard and far , just so in such array the Danaans moved Unhesitating to the battle line ? " He captures them , and holds their misery , thinking to himself , " What a wonder , what a magic in the old chant ! " He eases them out of this terrible darkness and they stand on the pearly beaches of Troy . There are the white towers of the city ! There are the golden , bronze-girt warriors ! The soft chant rises and falls and loosens the knots of terror and anxiety ,  | and in the darkness there is shuffling and motion . The slaves do not have to know Greek , and indeed the Thracian dialect of Spartacus is little enough like the tongue of Attica ; they know of the chant , where the old wisdom of a people is preserved and kept for the time of trial .. . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . Young as he is , he long ago met and conquered the terrible enemy of sleeplessness . Now he composes himself and explores the memories of childhood . He wants cool , clear blue sky and sunshine and soft breezes , and all of these are there . He lies among the pines , watching the goats graze , and an old , old man is beside him . The old man teaches him to read . With a stick , the old man traces letter after letter in the dirt . " Read and learn , my child , " the old man tells him . " So do we who are slaves carry a weapon with us . Without it , we are like the beasts in the fields . The same god who gave fire to men gave them the power to write down his thoughts , so that they may recall the thoughts of the gods in the golden time of long ago . Then men were close to the gods and talked with them at will , and there were no slaves then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers , and presently his memory turns into a dream , and presently he sleeps .. . He is awakened in the morning by the beating of a drum . The drum is beaten at the entrance to the barracks , and its crash echoes and re-echoes through the stone cavern . He rises , and all about him he hears his fellow slaves rising . They move in the pitch darkness toward the entrance . Spartacus takes his cup and bowl with him ; if he had forgotten it , there would have been no food or drink for him this day ; but he is wise in the ways of slavery , and there is not such great variation in the manner of slavery that he should not anticipate . As he moves , he feels the press of bodies around him , and he lets himself move with them to the opening at the end of the  | stone barracks . And all the while , the drum continues its crashing beat . It is the hour before the dawn , and now the desert is as cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , the desert is a friend . A gentle breeze cools the face of the black escarpment . The sky is a wonderful fading blue-black , and the twinkling stars gently disappear , the only womanly things in this cheerless , hopeless world of men . Even slaves in the gold mines of Nubia  --  from which none ever return  --  must have a little surcease ; and thus they are given the hour before dawn , so that a poignant bitter-sweet may fill their hearts and revive their hopes . The overseers stand to one side , grouped together , munching bread and sucking at water . Not for another four hours will the slaves be fed or watered , but it is one thing to be an overseer and another to be a slave . The overseers are wrapped in woolen cloaks , and each carries a whip , a weighted billy and a long knife . Who are these men , these overseers ? What brings them to this terrible womanless place in the desert ? They are men of Alexandria , bitter , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , and because they get a percentage of all the gold the mines produce . They are here with their own dreams of wealth and leisure , and with the promise of Roman citizenship when they have served five years in the interest of the corporation . They live for the future , when they will rent an apartment in one of the tenements in Rome , when they will each of them buy three or four or five slave girls to sleep with and to serve them , and when they will spend each day at the games or at the baths , and when they will be drunk each night . They believe that in coming to this hell , they heighten their future earthly heaven ; but the truth of the matter is that they , like all prison guards , require the petty lordship of the damned more than perfume and wine and women . They are strange men , a unique product of the slums of  | Alexandria , and the language they talk is a jargon of Aramaic and Greek . It is two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these overseers are not Egyptians and not Greeks , but Alexandrians . Which means that they are versatile in their corruption , cynical in their outlook , and believing of no gods at all . Their lusts are warped but commonplace ; they lie with men and they sleep a drugged sleep over the juice of the Khat leaves , which grow on the coast of the Red Sea . These are the men whom Spartacus watches , there in the cool hour before the dawn , as the slaves plod from the great stone barracks , shoulder their chains and go toward the escarpment . These will be his masters ; and over him they will hold the power of life and the power of death ; and so he watches for small differences , habits , mannerisms and indications . In the mines , there are no good masters , but it may be that there will be some less cruel and less sadistic than others . He watches them detach themselves , one by one , to take over where the slaves are shaping up . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of face and feature , but his is a practiced eye in such matters , and even in the walk and heft of a man there is definition . It is cool now , and the slaves are naked . Not even a loincloth hides their pitiful , futile , sun-blackened organs of sex , and they stand and shiver and wind their arms around their bodies . Anger comes slowly to Spartacus , for anger is not productive in the life of a slave , but he thinks , " All things but this we can bear , but when there is not even a scrap of cloth to cover our parts , we are like animals . " And then revises it in his mind , " No  --  less than animals . For when the Romans took the land where we were owned and the plantation where we labored , the beasts were left in the field and only we were sorted out for the mines . " Now the drum stops its wracking sound and the overseers  | uncoil their whips and crack the stiffness out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snapping and cracking music . They lay the whips in the air , for it is too early to lash the flesh , and the gangs move forward out of the shapeup . It is lighter now , and Spartacus can clearly see the skinny , shivering children who will crawl down into the belly of the earth and claw at the white stone where the gold is found . The other Thracians also see , for they crowd close around Spartacus , and some of them whisper , " Father , oh father , what kind of a hell is this ! " " It will be all right , " Spartacus says ; for when you are called father by those old enough to be your father , what else is there to say ? So he says the words which he must say . Now all the gangs have gone toward the escarpment , and only the huddled group of Thracians remain . A half dozen overseers are left , and led by one of their group , their whips dragging tracks through the sand , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demands , in his thick jargon , " Who is your leader , Thracians ? " No answer . " It is too early for the whip , Thracians . " Now Spartacus says , " They call me father . " The overseer looks him up and down and takes his measure . " You are young to be called father . " " It is the custom in our land . " " We have other customs here , father . When the child sins , the father is whipped . Do you hear me ? " " I hear you . " " Then listen , all of you Thracians . This is a bad place , but it can be worse . When you live , we ask work and obedience . When you die , we ask little . In other places , it is better to live than to die . But here we can make it better to die than to live . Do you understand me , Thracians ? "  | The sun is rising now . They are chained and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is removed . The brief coolness of the morning is already gone . They are given tools , iron picks , sledges , and iron wedges . They are shown a streak of white in the black rock at the base of the escarpment . It may be the beginning of the vein ; it may be nothing at all . They are to cut away the black rock and expose the goldbearing stone . Now the sun is in the sky , and the terrible heat of the day begins again . Pick and sledge and wedge . Spartacus swings a hammer . Each hour , there is a pound more of weight in the feel of the hammer . Hard he is , but never before in his life of toil did he do such work as this , and soon every muscle of his body strains and whimpers with the tension . It is simple to say that a hammer weighs eighteen pounds ; but there are no words to tell the tortures of a man who swings such a hammer hour after hour . And here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It oozes from his skin ; it runs from his forehead down into his eyes ; he wills with all the strength of his will that the sweat should stop ; he knows that in this climate , to sweat is to perish . But the sweat will not stop , and thirst becomes a savage , aching , terrible animal inside of him . Four hours are forever ; four hours are eternity . Who knows better than a slave how to control the desires of a body , but four hours are forever , and when the water bags are passed through the gangs , Spartacus feels that he is dying of thirst . As do all the Thracians , and they drain the leather jacks of the crawling green and blessed fluid . And then they know what a thoughtless thing they have done . These are the gold mines of Nubia . By midday , their strength and power to work is ebbing , and then the whips begin to urge them on . Oh , there is a great mastery of the whip in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body , delicately , lightly , threateningly , warningly . It can touch  | a man 's groin or his mouth or his back or his brow . It is like an instrument , and it can play music on the body of a man . Now thirst is ten times worse than before , but the water is gone , and there will be no more water until the day 's work is over . And such a day is eternity . And yet it ends . Everything ends . There is a time of beginning and a time of ending . Once again , the drum beats , and the day 's work is over . Spartacus lets go of the hammer and looks at his bleeding hands . Some of the Thracians sit down . One , a lad of eighteen , rolls over and lies on his side , his legs drawn up in tight agony . Spartacus goes to him . " Father  --  father , is that you ? " " Yes , yes , " Spartacus says , and he kisses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lips , for I am dying , my father , and what is left of my soul I want to give to you . " Then Spartacus kisses him , but he can not weep , for he is dry and singed , like burnt leather . iv So Batiatus finished his tale of how Spartacus and other Thracians came to the gold mines of Nubia and how they labored naked on the face of the black escarpment . It had taken a long time in the telling . The rain had stopped . Darkness had fallen , profoundly and wholly under the leaden sky , and the two men , the one a trainer of gladiators and the other a patrician soldier of fortune who would some day be the wealthiest man in his world , sat in the flickering area of light which the lamps cast . Batiatus had drunk a good deal , and the loose muscles of his face had become looser . He was the kind of sensualist who combines sadism with an enormous power of self pity and subjective identification , and his tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color and pity too , and Crassus was moved in spite of himself .  | Crassus was neither an ignorant nor an insensitive man , and he had read the mighty cycle which Aeschylus wrote on Prometheus , and he saw something of what it meant for a Spartacus to emerge from where he had been to a point where no power Rome could assemble might stand up against his slaves . He had an almost passionate need to understand Spartacus , to envision Spartacus  --  yes , and to crawl a little inside of Spartacus , as difficult as that might be , so that the eternal riddle of his class , the riddle of the man in chains who reaches for the stars , might resolve itself somewhat . He squinted at Batiatus now , telling himself that actually he owed this fat and ugly man a great deal and wondering which of the bedraggled maidens of the camp might be found to share his couch for this night . Such generalized lust was not within the comprehension of Crassus , whose desires operated differently , but the commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how did Spartacus escape from that place ? " he asked the lanista . " He did not escape . No one escapes from such a place . The virtue of such a place is that it so quickly destroys the desire of the slave to re-enter the world of men . I bought Spartacus out of there . " . " Out of there ? But why ? And how did you know he was there , or who he was or what he was ? " " I did n't know . But you think my reputation for gladiators is a legend , a fiction  --  you think that I 'm a fat and useless hulk , knowing nothing about anything . But there is an art even to my own profession , I assure you ? " " I believe you , " nodded Crassus . " Tell me how you bought Spartacus . " " Is wine forbidden to the Legion ? " asked Batiatus , holding up the empty bottle . " Or must I add drunkenness to the contempts in which you hold me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rein on his tongue which only liquor loosens ? "  | " I 'll bring you more wine , " answered Crassus , and he rose and went through the curtain to his sleeping chamber , returning with another bottle . Batiatus was his comrade , and Batiatus did not bother with the stopper , but knocked the neck off the bottle against the table leg and poured until his glass dripped over . " Blood and wine , " he smiled . " I would have liked to have been born differently and to command a legion . But who knows ? Your own pleasure might be to see the gladiators fight . I am bored with it . " " I see enough fighting . " " Yes , of course . But there is a style in the arena and a courage in the arena that your own mass butchery can not quite match . They send you to retrieve the fortune of Rome after Spartacus has smashed three quarters of the armed power of Rome . Do you hold Italy ? The truth of it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No enemy can stand against Rome . But for the moment , he has you one better . Yes ? " " Yes , " answered Crassus . " And who trained Spartacus ? I did . He never fought in Rome , but the best fighting is not at Rome . A butcher shop is what Rome appreciates , but the truly great fighting is at Capua and in Sicily . I tell you , no legionary knows how to fight , all covered up with galea , pectoralis , and humeralia , like a child in the womb , poking with that stick of yours . Go naked into the arena , with a sword in hand and nothing else . Blood on the sand , and you smell it as you walk in . The trumpets are playing and the drums are beating and the sun is shining down and the ladies are waving their lace handkerchiefs and ca n't keep their eyes off your parts , hanging all naked in front of you , and they will all have thrills enough before the afternoon is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliced , and you stand there crying while your guts pour out on the  | sand . That is fighting , my commander  --  and to do that well , ordinary men are no good . You need another breed , and where do you find them ? I am willing to spend money to make money , and I send my agents out to buy what I need . I send them to places where weak men die quickly and where cowards kill themselves . Twice a year , I send to the Nubian mines . Once , I was there myself  --  yes , and that once was sufficient . To keep a mine operating , you must use up slaves . Most are good for two years , no more ; many are good for only six months . But the only profitable way to work a mine is to use up slaves quickly and always buy more . And since the slaves know this , there is always the danger of desperation . That is the great enemy in the mines , desperation . A catching disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong man who is not afraid of the whip and to whom other men listen , why the best thing to do is to kill him quickly and spike him out in the sunshine , so that the flies can feed on his flesh and everyone can see the fruit of desperation . But that kind of killing is waste and adds to no one 's purse , so I have an arrangement with the overseers and they keep such men for me and sell them at a fair price . The money goes into their pockets , and no one is the loser . Such men make good gladiators . " " And that is how you bought Spartacus ? " " Precisely . I bought Spartacus and another Thracian called Gannicus . You know that at the time there was a great vogue for Thracians , because they are good with the dagger . One year it 's the dagger , the next year the sword , the next year the fuscina . As a matter of fact , many Thracians have never touched the dagger , . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a dagger in the hands of anyone else . " " You bought him yourself ? " " Through my agents . They shipped the two of them in chains from Alexandria , and I keep a port agent at Naples and ship inland by litter . "  | " Yours is not a small business , " admitted Crassus , who was always alert for a place to invest a little money profitably . " So you appreciate that , " nodded Batiatus , the wine Tuning from the corners of his mouth as he stretched his ponderous jowls . " So few people do . What do you think is my investment in Capua ? " Crassus shook his head . " It never occurred to me . One sees gladiators , and one does n't stop to think of what was the investment before they walk into the arena . But that 's common . One sees a legion , and one says , there have always been legions and therefore there always will be legions . " It was superb flattery . Batiatus put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rubbed a finger up and down his bulbous nose . " Guess . " " A million ? " " Five million denarii , " Batiatus said , slowly and emphatically . " Five million denarii . Only consider . I deal with agents in five countries . I keep a port agent in Naples . I feed only the best , whole wheat , barley , beef and goat cheese . I have my own arena for small shows and pairs , but the amphitheatre has a stone grandstand and it cost a cool million . I quarter and feed a maniple out of the local garrison . Not to mention the bribes in the same direction  --  begging your pardon . Not all military men are like yourself . And if you fight your lads in Rome , it 's fifty thousand denarii a year for the tribunes and the ward bosses . Not to mention the women . " " Women ? " asked Crassus . " A gladiator is not a plough-hand on the latifundia . If you want him to have tone , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats better and he fights better . I have a house for my women and I buy only the best , no sluts or withered old bags , but every one is strong and healthy and virgin when she comes into my hands . I know ; I try them . " He  | drained his glass , licked his lips , and looked plaintive and lonely . " I need women , " he complained , pouring the wine slowly . " Some men do n't  --  I do . " " And this woman they call the wife of Spartacus ? " " Varinia , " said Batiatus . He had turned in upon himself , and in his eyes there was a world of hatred , anger and wanting . " Varinia , " he repeated . " Tell me about her . " A measure of silence told Crassus more than the words which followed . " She was nineteen when I bought her . A German bitch , but good to look at if you like the yellow hair and the blue eyes . A dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me God ! I gave her to Spartacus instead . It was a joke . He did n't want a woman and she did n't want a man . It was a joke . " " Tell me about her . " " I told you about her ! " snarled Batiatus . He got up and stumbled through the flaps of the tent , and Crassus heard him urinating outside . It was a virtue of the commander that he pursued his goals single-mindedly . Batiatus stumbling back to the table did not disturb him . It was not his goal or need to make a gentleman out of the lanista . " Tell me about her , " he insisted . Batiatus shook his head ponderously . " Do you mind if I get drunk ? " he asked with aggrieved dignity . " I have no feelings upon the matter . You may drink what you please , " answered Crassus . " But you were telling me that you had Spartacus and Gannicus brought inland by litter . In chains , I suppose ? " Batiatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " " No . What I saw , you would have thought little of , but I judge men differently . The two of them were bearded , filthy , covered all over with ulcers and sores and marked from head  | to foot with the whip . The stink of them was so bad it turned your stomach to go near them . Their own dry excrement was all over them . They were pared down to the limit and only their eyes demonstrated the desperantes . You would not have taken them to clean your latrines , but I looked at them and I saw something , because that is my own art . I put them in the baths , had them shaved and had their hair cut , had them rubbed with oil and fed well ? " " Will you tell me of Varinia now ? " " Damn you ! " The lanista reached for his goblet of wine , but clumsily , overturning it . He lay forward on the table , staring at the red stain . What he saw therein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , and perhaps he saw something of the future too . For the art of the augur is not wholly a fraud , and only men , not animals , have the power to judge the consequences of their acts . This was the man who trained Spartacus ; he had threaded himself into a future that has no ending  --  even as all men do  --  but for ages unknown and unborn , he would be remembered . The trainer of men who had trained Spartacus sat facing the leader of men who would destroy Spartacus ; but they shared in augury the vague and puzzled understanding that no one could destroy Spartacus . And because they shared even a glimmer of this , they were both of them similarly damned . v ( Your fat friend , Lentulus Batiatus , said Crassus , the commander , but Caius Crassus , the lad who lay beside him on the bed , was dozing , eyes closed  --  and had heard only fragments of the story . Crassus was not a story teller ; the tale was in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servile War was done and Spartacus was done . The Villa Salaria signifies  | peace and prosperity , and that Roman peace which has blessed the earth , and he lay abed with a boy . And why not ? he asked himself . Is it worse than other great men did ? ( Caius Crassus brooded on the crosses that lined the road from Rome to Capua , for he was hardly entirely asleep . It did not trouble him that he shared a bed with the great general . His generation no longer felt a need to assuage guilt by rationalizing homosexuality . It was normal for him . The passion of six thousand slaves who hung from the crosses by the roadside was normal for him . He was much happier than Crassus , the great general . Crassus , the great general , was a man beset by devils ; but Crassus , the young man of noble birth  --  distantly related , perhaps , for the family called Crassus was one of the largest in Rome at the time  --  struggled against no devils . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hated a dead slave ; but when he opened his eyes and looked into the shadowed face of Crassus , he was at a loss to explain his hatred . ( You are not sleeping , said Crassus , no you are not sleeping after all , and there 's the story , for what it is  --  if you heard any of it  --  and why do you hate Spartacus , who is now dead and gone forever ? ( But Caius Crassus was lost in his own memories . It was four years before , and his friend had been Bracus . And with Bracus , he had journeyed down the Appian Way to Capua , and Bracus had wanted to please him . To please him gallantly and richly and abundantly , for what can be better than to sit next to a man you want in the cushions of the arena and to see men fight to the death ? At that time , four years before now , four years before this strange evening at the Villa Salaria , he had shared a litter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he would see the best of fighting , which was at Capua  --  and that the cost would be no barrier .  | There would be blood on the sand , and they would drink wine as they watched it . ( And then he had gone with Bracus to see Lentulus Batiatus , who kept the best school and trained the finest gladiators in all of Italy . ( And all of it , Caius reflected , was four years before  --  before there had been any Servile War , before anyone had heard the name of Spartacus . And now , Bracus was dead and Spartacus was also dead , and he , Caius , lay in bed with the greatest general of Rome. )  | PART THREE . Being the tale of the first journey to Capua , made by Marius Bracus and Caius Crassus , some four years before the evening at the Villa Salaria , and of the fighting of two pairs of gladiators . One fine spring day , when Lentulus Batiatus , the lanista , sat in his office , belching intermittently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wished to talk with him about fighting some pairs . Both the office and accountant  --  a well-educated Ionian slave  --  were indications of wealth and prosperity on the part of Batiatus . His apprenticeship in ward politics and organized street fighting , his shrewd ladder of attachment to one important family after another , and the organizational ability which had permitted him to create one of the largest and most efficient street gangs in the city , had paid off well  --  and the investment of his carefully hoarded earnings in a small school for gladiators at Capua had been a wise one . As he often liked to put it , he rode on the wave of the future . A gangster could go so far and no further , and no gangster is shrewd enough always to select the winning side . More  | powerful gangs than his had been wiped off the Roman scene by the unexpected victory of an opponent and the savage fury of a new Consul . On the other hand , the fighting of pairs  --  as it was commonly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was legitimate ; it was a recognized business ; and anyone who read the signs of the times properly knew that it was only in its infancy . A casual entertainment would soon become the overwhelming craze of a whole social system . Politicians were beginning to realize that if one can not have the glory of successful war on foreign soil , one can do almost as well by creating a minor replica at home , and the fighting of a hundred pairs , stretching through days and weeks , was already not uncommon . The demand for trained gladiators could never be filled , and prices were going higher and higher . Stone arenas were being built in city after city , and finally , when one of the most beautiful and imposing arenas in all Italy was built at Capua , Lentulus Batiatus decided to go there and start a school . He had started in a very small way , with just a little shack and a crude fighting pen , training one pair at a time ; but his business had grown rapidly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment where he trained and stocked better than one hundred pairs . He had his own stone cellblock , his own gymnasium and bath house , his own training course , and his own arena for private shows  --  nothing like the public amphitheatres , of course , but capable of seating parties of fifty or sixty and large enough to fight three pairs at the same time . In addition , he had established sufficient local connections with the military  --  with appropriate bribes ? to have a sufficient force of regular troops available at all times , and therefore spare himself the expense of creating his own private police force . His kitchen served a small army , for with the gladiators , their women , the trainers , house slaves  | and litter slaves , his household consisted of more than four hundred people . He had reason to be satisfied with himself . The office in which he sat on this sunny spring morning was his latest acquisition . At the beginning of his career , he had resisted any and all window dressing . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . But as his profits mounted , he found that it behooved him to live accordingly . He began to buy Greek slaves , and both an architect and an accountant were included in the purchases . The architect had persuaded him to build an office in the Greek style , flatroofed and columned , with only three walls , the fourth side being open to the pleasantest prospect his situation afforded . With the drapes drawn back , a whole side of the room was open to fresh air and sunshine . The marble floor and the lovely white table upon which he conducted his affairs were in excellent taste . The open side was at his back , and he faced the doorway . Beyond that , he had a room for his clerks and a waiting room . It was a far cry , indeed , from gang warfare in the alleys of Rome . Now the accountant said , " Two of them  --  rosillae . Perfume , rouge , and very expensive rings and clothes . A lot of money , but they are rosillae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a young boy , about twenty-one , I would guess . The other is trying to please him . " " Let them come in , " Batiatus said . A moment later , the two young men entered , and Batiatus rose with excessive politeness , indicating two stools in front of his table . As they seated themselves , Batiatus observed them quickly and expertly . They had an air of wealth , but only enough of it to show that they did not have to exhibit their wealth . They were young men of good family , but not in the great tradition  --  for what they were was entirely too obvious to have been tolerated by one of the sterner city gees . The  | younger one , Caius Crassus , was as pretty as a girl . Bracus was somewhat older , harder , playing the dominant role of the two . He had cold blue eyes and sandy hair , thin lips and a cynical expression . He did the talking . Caius merely listened , only glancing at his friend occasionally with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy familiarity of the devotee of the games . " I am Lentulus Batiatus , lanista , " said the fat man , giving himself a title of contempt which , he vowed , would cost them at least 5,000 denarii before the day was over . Bracus introduced both of them and came to the point immediately . " We would like a private showing of two pairs . " " For just the two of you ? " " Ourselves and two friends . " The lanista nodded gravely and placed his fat hands together , so that his two diamonds , his emerald and his ruby showed to good advantage . " That can be arranged , " he said . " To the death , " said Bracus calmly . " What ? " " You heard me . I want two pairs , Thracians , to the death . " " Why ? " demanded Batiatus . " Why , whenever you young folk come down from Rome , must it be to the death ? You can see just as much blood and just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . Why to the death ? " " Because we prefer it . " " That is no answer . Look , look , " said Batiatus , spreading his hands for calm and thought and scientific consideration among men who knew the game , " you ask for Thracian . I have the best Thracian play in the world , but you will not see good play or good dagger work if you ask for the death . You know that as well as I do . It stands to reason . You pay your money  --  and then , zoot ! it is finished . I can give you a day 's play on points that will be like nothing you ever  | saw in Rome . As a matter of fact , you could go to the theatre and see better than anywhere in Rome . But if you come to me for private pleasure , then I stand on my reputation . My reputation is not as a butcher . I want to give you good fighting , the best fighting that money can buy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We want it to the death . " That 's a contradiction ! " " To your way of thinking , " Bracus said softly . " You would like to keep both my money and your gladiators . When I pay for something , I buy it . I am buying two pairs to the death . If you do n't wish to serve me , I can go elsewhere . " " Did I say I did n't want to serve you ? I want to serve you better than you think . I can give you two pairs in rounds from morning until night , eight hours a day in the arena if you wish . And I will replace if any part of a pair is cut up too badly . I will give you all the blood and excitement you or your ladies could possibly desire , and I will charge you no more than 8,000 denarii for the whole thing . That includes food and wine and services of any kind you may desire . " " You know what we desire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldly . " All right . It will cost you 25,000 denarii . " Caius was impressed  --  indeed somewhat frightened at the enormous figure , but Bracus shrugged . " Very well . They are to fight naked . " " Naked ? " " You heard me , lanista ! " " All right . " " And I want no fakery  --  no double cuts for them both to suck the sand and pretend that they are finished . If they are both down , one of your trainers will cut the throats of both . And they are to understand that . " Batiatus nodded .  | " I will give you ten thousand on account and the rest when the pairs have finished . " " All right . Please pay my accountant . He will give you a receipt and draw contracts for you . Do you want to see them before you leave ? " " Can we have the arena in the morning ? " " In the morning  --  yes . But I must warn you that this kind of a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't warn me , lanista . " He turned to Caius and asked , " Do you want to see them , child ? " Caius smiled shyly and nodded . They went out , and after Bracus had paid and signed the contract , they crawled into their litters and were carried to the exercise yard . Caius could not take his eyes off Bracus . Never , he thought , had he seen a man conduct himself so admirably . Not merely the 25,000 denarii  --  his own allowance of a thousand denarii a month was considered munificent by everyone he knew  --  but the manner of spending and the casual dealing with human life . It was a kind of cynical contempt to which Caius aspired , and which marked , for him , the highest level of cosmopolitanism ; and in this case it was combined with a wonderfully cool sophistication . Never in a thousand years would he have had the courage to demand that the gladiators fight naked ; yet that was one of the reasons why they were having a show for their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome . At the exercise yard , the slaves set down their litters . The exercise yard was an iron-barred enclosure , one hundred and fifty feet long and forty feet wide , caged in iron on three sides , with the cell block where the gladiators lived as its fourth side . Caius realized that here was a higher and more dangerous art than the training and keeping of wild beasts ; for a gladiator was not only a dangerous beast , but one who could think as well . A delightful thrill of fear and excitement  | went through him as he watched the men in the exercise yard . There were about a hundred of them , clad in loin cloths and nothing else , clean-shaven , their hair cropped close to their heads , going through their paces with wooden sticks and staffs . About six trainers walked among them , and these , like all trainers , were old veterans of the army . The trainer carried a short Spanish sword in one hand and heavy brass knuckles in the other , and he walked warily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maniple of regular army troops were spread at intervals all around the enclosure , their heavy , murderous pila exacting an extraordinary discipline . No wonder , Caius thought , the price of the death of a few of these men was high . The gladiators themselves were superbly muscled and as graceful as panthers in their motions . Roughly , they fell into three classes , the three classes of fighters so popular in Italy at this time . There were the Thracians  --  a grouping or profession more than a race , for there were numerous Jews and Greeks among them  --  who were most desired at this time . They fought with the sica , a short , slightly curved dagger , the common weapon in Thrace and in Judea , where most of them were recruited . The retiarii were just beginning their epoch of popularity , and they fought with two curious weapons , a fish net and a long , three-pronged fish fork called a tridens . For this category , Batiatus preferred Africans , tall , long-limbed black men from Ethiopia , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fighters who carried either a sword alone or sword and shield . The murmillones were almost always Germans or Gauls . " Note them , " said Bracus , pointing to the black men . " There is the finest play and the most skillful , but it can be a bore . To see it at its best , you must see Thracian . Do n't you agree ? " he asked Batiatus . The lanista shrugged . " Each has its virtues . "  | " Match me a Thracian against a black man . " Batiatus looked at him a moment , then shook his head . " It is no match . The Thracian has only a dagger . " " I want it , " said Bracus . Batiatus shrugged , caught the eye of one of the trainers , and nodded for him to come . Fascinated , Caius watched the lines of gladiators go through their precise , dance-like exercises , the Thracians and Jews doing their dagger work with little sticks and little wooden bucklers , the black men casting nets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like broom handles , and the big , blond Germans and Gauls fencing with wooden swords . Never in all his life had he seen men so conditioned , so agile , so graceful , so apparently tireless , as they went through the paces of the dance , over and over and over . There , in the sunlight behind the iron bars , they communicated even to Caius  --  even to his poor , warped , twisted conscience  --  a sense of pity that life so splendid and vital should serve only for butchery . But only a flicker of this ; never before had Caius experienced such intense excitment at the prospect of a future event . Boredom had entered his life when he was only a child . He was not bored now . The trainer was explaining , " The dagger has only one keen edge . Once the dagger is in the net , the Thracian is finished . It makes for bad blood in the school . It 's no match . " " Get them , " Batiatus said shortly . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Thracians , " Bracus said coldly . " Do n't argue with me ! " " You heard him , " said the lanista . The trainer carried a little silver whistle on a string around his neck . Now he blew it sharply three times and the lines of gladiators came to rest . " Who do you want ? " he asked Batiatus.  | " Draba . " " Draba ! " the trainer shouted . One of the black men turned and walked toward them , dragging net and stick . A giant of a man , his dark skin glistening with a sheen of sweat . " David . " " David ! " the trainer shouted . This was a Jew , lean , hawk-faced , thin bitter lips , and green eyes in a clean-shaven , tanned face and head . His wooden dagger was hooked in fingers that kept flexing and unflexing , and he stared through the guests without seeing them . " A Jew , " said Bracus to Caius . " Have you ever seen a Jew ? " Caius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews are very good with the sica . It is all they know of fighting , but they are very good . " " Polemus . " " Polemus ! " the trainer shouted . This was a Thracian , very young and graceful and handsome . " Spartacus ! " He joined the other three . The four men stood there , separated from the two Roman youths , the lanista and the litter slaves by the heavy iron fence of the exercise yard . Looking at them , Caius realized that they were something new , something different and strange and terrible in his own terms . It was not only the sullen , brooding masculinity of them  --  a masculinity that almost never existed in his own circle of acquaintances  --  but the way they were closed off from him . They were men trained to fight and kill , not as soldiers fought , not as animals fought , but as gladiators fought , which was something else entirely . He was looking at four frightening masks . " How do you like them ? " Batiatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caius have answered or spoken at all , but Bracus said coolly , " All except that one with the broken nose . He does n't look like a fighter . " " Looks can be deceiving , " Batiatus reminded him . " That 's Spartacus . He is very good , very powerful , and very quick . I chose him for a purpose . He is very quick . " " Who will you match him with ? " " With the black man , " answered Batiatus . " Very well . I hope it 's worth the price , " said Bracus . That was when and how Caius saw Spartacus ; although four years later he had forgotten the names of any of the gladiators and only remembered the hot sunshine , the feel and smell of the place , the smell of men 's bodies running sweat . II This is Varinia , who lies awake in the darkness , and she has not slept this night , not at all , not even for a few moments ; but Spartacus , who lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how completely ! The soft flow of his breath , the intaking and outgiving of air , which is the fuel for the fire of life within him , is as regular and as even as all the timely ebbing and flowing in the world of life , and Varinia thinks of that and knows that what is at peace and at grips with life has this same regularity , whether it be the motion of the tides , the passing of the seasons , or the fruition of the egg within the woman . But how can a man sleep in such a fashion , when he knows what he faces on waking ? How can he slumber at the edge of death ? Where does his peace come from ? Very lightly , most lightly , Varinia touches him and traces out his skin , his flesh and his limbs as he lies there in the darkness . The skin is elastic and fresh and alive ; the muscles are relaxed ; the limbs are loose and resting . Sleep is precious ; sleep is life for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my darling , my gentle one , my good one , my terrible one  --  sleep . Sleep and husband your strength , my man , my man . ) Gently and carefully , her whole motion like a whisper , Varinia closes with him , so that more and more of her own flesh is touching his , her long limbs pressed against his , her full breasts cushioned to him , her face finally touching his , cheek to cheek , her golden hair spread like a crown above him , her terror eased by memories now and by love , for fear and love do not live easily together . ( She had said to him once , I want you to do something . I want you to do something that we do in the tribe because we believe something . He smiled at her , What do you believe in with the tribe ? She said , You will laugh , and then he answered , Do I ever laugh ? Have I ever laughed ? Then she said to him , In the tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose and the mouth , a little with the breath each time . You are smiling . Then he answered , I am not smiling at you . I am smiling at the wonderful things people believe ; to which she cried , Because you are a Greek , and Greeks believe nothing at all . He told her then , I am not a Greek but a Thracian , and it is not true that the Greeks believe nothing at all , but the best and the richest things people can believe , these things the Greeks believe . To this , her answer was that she did n't care what the Greeks believed , but would he do what they did in the tribe ? Would he put his mouth to her mouth and breathe his breath and his soul into her ? And then she would do the same to him , and forever and for all time their souls would be mingled and they would be one person in two bodies . Or was he afraid ? And this he answered by saying , Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lies with him now on the thin pallet on the floor of their cell . The cell is their home . The cell is their castle . All their being together has been in this stone cubicle , which  | measures five feet by seven feet and which contains only a chamber pot and a pallet . But even these are not theirs ; nothing is theirs , not even each other , and she lies by him now , touching his face and limbs and weeping softly  --  she whom no one ever saw weep in the daylight . ( I do not give women , I lend women , Batiatus was fond of saying . I lend them to my gladiators . A man is no good in the arena if his parts shrivel up . A gladiator is not a litter slave . A gladiator is a man , and if he 's not a man , no one will pay ten denarii for him . And a man needs a woman . I buy the incorrigibles because they are cheap , and if I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is passing , and the first faint gray of the dawn enters the cell . If Varinia were to stand up , rising to her full , tall lissome height , her head would be on a level with the single window of the cell . If she were to look out of the cell , she would see the iron-walled stretch of the exercise ground and beyond it the sleepy soldiers who stand guard day and night . She knows it well . Cell and chains are not the natural habitat for her , as they are for Spartacus . ( This particular woman filled Batiatus with eagerness and delight . His agent had purchased her in Rome for very little , as a matter of fact , for only 500 denarii , so he knew that the merchandise was hardly unblemished , but just to look at her filled him with eagerness and delight . For one thing , she was tall and beautifully formed , as many of the German tribewomen were , and Batiatus admired tall , shapely women . For another thing , she was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Batiatus enjoyed young women . For still another thing , she was quite beautiful and had a grand head of yellow hair , and Batiatus preferred beautiful women with fine hair . So it is not difficult to understand why she filled the lanista with eagerness and delight . ( But the blemish was there , and he discovered that the  | first time he tried to take her to bed . She became a wild cat . She became a kicking , spitting , scratching , clawing monster ? and since she was large and strong , he had a bad time beating her into unconsciousness . In the struggle , all the expensive objects which decorated his bedroom were smashed , including a beautiful Greek vase which he had to use to beat her over the head with until she ceased to struggle . His rage and frustration were such that he would  --  he felt  --  have been entirely justified in killing her ; but when he added the fine vases , lamps and statuettes to her original cost , he considered that the investment was entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his anger . Nor could he in all good faith sell her in the market for a price in accordance with her appearance . Perhaps because he had started as a gang leader in the alleys of Rome , Batiatus had an extraordinary concern for business ethics . He prided himself on the fact that he sold nothing on false pretenses . Instead , he decided to let the gladiators tame her , and because he had already taken an unreasonable dislike to the strange , silent Thracian called Spartacus  --  whose sheep-like exterior covered a flame respected by every gladiator in the school  --  he chose him for her mate . ( It pleased him to watch Spartacus as he handed Varinia over to him , saying , This is a mate to lie with . Bring her to child or not , as you please . Make her obey you , but do n't injure her or deform her . That is what he said to Spartacus , as Spartacus stood silent and impassive , looking calmly at the German girl . Varinia was not beautiful on that occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One eye was swollen closed , yellow and purple , and there were green and purple bruises on her forehead , her neck and her arms . ( See what you are getting , said Batiatus , tearing off the already torn dress which he had given her , and then she stood naked in front of Spartacus . At that moment , Spartacus  | saw her and loved her , not for her nakedness , but because without clothes she was not naked at all and did not cringe or attempt to cover herself with her arms , but stood simply and proudly , showing no pain nor hurt , not looking at him or at Batiatus , but contained within herself , contained with her eyesight and her soul and her dreams , and containing all those things because she had decided to surrender life which was worth nothing any more . His heart went out to her . ( That night , she huddled at the farthest corner of his cell , and he left her alone , made no move toward her except to ask her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? no answer . Then he said , I will talk to you in Latin because I do n't speak German , and now the night chill is coming , and I want you to lie on my mat , girl  --  and still there was no answer from her . So he pushed the pallet toward her , and left it between them , and in the morning it was there , and they had both slept on the stone . But this was the first thoughtful kindness Varinia had encountered since they had taken her in the German forests , a year and half before . ) And on this damp night , turning into morning , the memory of that first night returns to her , and with the memory there goes from her into the man sleeping beside her , such a wave of love that he would have to be made of stone not to sense it . He stirs , and suddenly , he opens his eyes , seeing her dimly in the half light of the dawning , but seeing her wholly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes her to him and begins to caress her . " Oh , my darling , my darling , " she says . " Let me . " " And where will you find the strength for today , my be-loved ? " " Let me , I am full of strength . " Then she lies in his arms , the tears flowing silently .  | III The morning is for fighting , and it 's in the air and all over the place , and every one of the two hundred and some odd gladiators knows and responds to the electric knowledge . Two pairs will bleed on the sand because two young men have come down from Rome with a lot of money and a taste for excitement . Two Thracians , a Jew and an African , and since the African is trained to net and fork , the odds will be off . This is the kind of thing that many lanistae would not permit , for even if you breed a dog you do n't set him against a lion , but Batiatus will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakens on this morning , and in his own tongue , he says , " I greet thee , day of death . " He lies on his pallet and thinks about his life . He muses over the strange fact that all men , even the most miserable , have memories of love and care and kisses and play and joy and song and dance , and all men are afraid to die . Even when life is worth nothing at all , men cling to it . Even when they are lonely and a long way from home and bereft of any hope whatsoever of returning to their home and subject to every indignity and pain and cruelty and fed like sleek beasts and trained to fight for the amusement of others  --  even when this is so , they still cling to life . And he , who was once an honest homesteader , with home and wife and children of his own , a voice listened to in peace and honored in war  --  he who was all that is now given a fish net and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can laugh at him and clap their hands at him . He whispers the empty philosophy of his kind and his profession , " Dum vivamus , vivamus . " But it is empty and without solace , and his bones and muscles ache as he stands up to begin his day and force his body and mind to the task of killing Spartacus  --  whom he  | loves and values above all other white men in the place . Yet is n't it said , " Gladiator  --  make no friends of gladiators . " Iv They went to the baths first , the four of them walking together in silence . It was no use to talk , because there was nothing for them to talk about now , and since they would be together from now until they entered the arena , talking would only worsen the situation . Already , the baths were steaming hot , and they plunged into the murky water quickly , as if everything had to be gotten through without thought or consideration . The bath house was quite dark , forty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors were closed , only by a small mica skylight . Under this pale light , the water of the bath was dull gray , overlaid by the hot mist rising from it , steaming from the red-hot stones which had been dropped into it , filling the whole bath house with the heavy texture of vapor-saturated air . It penetrated every pore of Spartacus 's body , relaxed his tense muscles , and gave him a strange , divorced feeling of ease and comfort . The hot water was a never-ending wonder to him , and never did the dry death of Nubia wash entirely from him ; and never could he enter the bath house without reflecting on the care given to the bodies of those who were bred for death and trained to produce only death . When he had produced the things of life , wheat and barley and gold , his body was a dirty , useless thing , a thing of shame and filth , to be beaten and kicked and whipped and starved  --  but now that he had become a creature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal he had mined in Africa . And strangely enough , it was only now that hatred had come to flower in him . There was no room for hatred before ; hatred is a luxury that needs food and strength and even time for a certain kind of reflection . He had those things now , and  | he had Lentulus Batiatus as the living object of his hatred . Batiatus was Rome and Rome was Batiatus . He hated Rome and he hated Batiatus ; and he hated all things Roman . He had been born and bred to accept the tilling of the fields , the herding of cattle and the mining of metal ; but only in Rome had he come to see the breeding and training of men so that they could cut each other to pieces and bleed on the sand to the laughter and excitement of well bred men and women . From the baths , they went to the rubbing tables . As always , Spartacus closed his eyes as the fragrant olive oil was poured onto his skin and each separate muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers of the masseur . The first time this had happened to him , his feeling was that of a trapped animal , panic and terror , the small freedom of all he owned or had ever owned , his own flesh invaded by these probing , writhing fingers . By now , however , he could relax and take full advantage of what the masseur gave him . Twelve times , he had lain like this ; twelve times he had fought , eight times in the great amphitheatre of Capua , with the screaming , blood-maddened crowds urging him on , four times in the private arena of Batiatus for the edification of the wealthy connoisseurs of slaughter who travelled down from the mighty , legendary urbs , which he had never seen , to spend a day with their ladies or their male lovers watching men fight . Now , as always when he lay upon the rubbing table , he lived over those times . It was all graven on his mind . No horror of mine or field was like the horror which gripped you when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fear was like that particular fear ; no indignity was like this particular indignity of being chosen to kill . And so he learned that no form of human life was lower than the gladiator , and his very nearness to the beasts was  | rewarded with the same anxious care bestowed upon fine horses , even though Lentulus Batiatus or any other Roman would have been revolted at the thought of destroying a good horse in the arena . He wore his own mantle of fear and indignity , and now the fingers of the masseur traced the weave of each thread and cross thread of scar tissue . He had been lucky . Never had he suffered a severed nerve , a scraped bone , a gouged eye , a dagger point in the eardrum or the neck or any others of those special and particular wounds his comrades feared so and dreamed of at night in a sweat of agony and terror . Never had he been hamstrung or had his intestines pierced . All his wounds were simple mementa , as they called them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to . Skill in this butchery ! No slave makes a soldier , they said . But he was quick as a cat , almost as quick as the green-eyed Jew , the creature of hate and silence who lay on the table beside him , and very strong and very thoughtful . That was hardest  --  to think and not to become angry . Ira est mors . And those who became angry in the arena , they died . Fear was something else , but no anger . It was not hard for him . All his life , his thoughts had been his tools of survival . Few people knew that . " The slave  --  he thinks of nothing at all . " And , " The gladiator is a beast . " That was obvious , but within it was its very reverse . Once in a while , a free man survives by thought ; but from day to day , the slave must think to live  --  another kind of thought , yet thought . Thought was the philosopher 's companion , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , he blotted her out . She must not exist for him . If he lived , she would live , but now he was neither alive nor dead . The masseurs finished . The four slaves slid off the tables and wrapped around them the long woolen cloaks , shrouds as they were called , and walked across the yard into the mess hall . Already the gladiators were at their morning meal , each  | man sitting cross-legged on the floor and eating from a little table in front of him . Each man had a cup of sour goatmilk and a bowl of wheat porridge cooked with bits of fat pork . The lanista fed well , and many a man who came to his school ate his fill for the first time , even as the condemned man does before he is nailed to the crucifix . But for the four who were to perform in the arena , there was only a little wine and a few strips of cold sliced chicken . One does not fight well on a heavy stomach . In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the others , the four of them , and they shared a distaste for food . They sipped at the wine . They took a bite or two of the meat , and sometimes they looked at each other . But no one spoke , and theirs was a little island of silence in the rumble of speech which filled the hall . Nor did the other gladiators look at them or pay them overmuch attention . This was the courtesy of the last breakfast . It was common knowledge now how they were paired . Everyone knew that Spartacus would fight the black man , and that it would be dagger against net and fork . Everyone knew that the Thracian and the Jew were paired . Spartacus would die and the young Thracian would die . It was the fault of Spartacus . Not only did he lie with the German girl and speak of her always as his wife and in no other way than as his wife  --  but he made the men love him . No one of the gladiators seated there in the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it had happened or precisely how it had happened . A man has a manner ; a man has a thousand little gestures and actions . The gentle manner of the Thracian , the sheep-like face with the full lips and the broken nose  --  all of that belied a quality which would make men accept his judgment , come to him with fears and quarrels , come to him for comfort and decision . Yet when he decided , they did as he said . When he spoke to them in his soft , curi-  | ously-accented Latin , they accepted his words . He spoke to them and they were comforted . He seemed to be a happy man . He held his head upright , which was a strange thing in a slave ; he never bowed his head ; he never raised his voice , nor was he angry . His contentment singled him out , and he walked that way in this unholy company of trained killers and lost men . " Gladiators are animals , " Batiatus often said . " If one thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The simple fact was that Spartacus refused to be an animal , and for that reason he was dangerous , and for all his skill with the dagger and for all his value for hire , Batiatus preferred him profitably dead . The breakfast was over . The four men who were privilegio , as it was put in the irony of their own slang , walked by themselves . They were forbidden this morning . They were not to be spoken to or touched . But Gannicus went over to Spartacus and embraced him and kissed his lips ; it was a strange thing to do , and the price was high , thirty lashes , but there were few among the gladiators who did not have a sense of why he had done it . v Many times in the years that followed , Lentulus Batiatus recalled that morning , and many times he subjected it to his scrutiny and attempted to understand whether the earthshaking events which followed could be ascribed to it . Yet he was not certain that they could , and it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards happened because two Roman fops desired to see a private combat to the death . Never a week went by but that there was a private showing of one or two or three pairs in his own arena , and he could not see that this was too different . It made him think of the fate of certain tenement houses he  | owned in the city of Rome . These tenement houses , or insulae , as they were called , were commonly recognized as one of the best investments a business man could make . They were subject to none of the vicissitudes of merchant enterprise ; they paid a steady and for the most part a rising rate of income , and this income could be increased . But a certain danger was contained within this increase of income . In the beginning , Batiatus bought two houses , one four stories and one five stories high . Each had twelve apartments to a floor , and each apartment cost its tenant about nine hundred sesterces a year . It did not take Batiatus long to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unenterprising scavengers owned low houses ; rich men owned skyscrapers . Promptly the lanista ran the five story house up to seven stories , but the first addition to the four story house brought it crashing down in ruins , saddling him not only with a huge loss , but with the death of over twenty of his tenants  --  which meant the additional spending of a fortune in bribes . Something of the same addition of quantity and resulting change in quality existed here , in terms of his gladiators , yet Batiatus knew that he was no worse in his practice than most lanistae , and , indeed , better than many . It was true that this was a bad morning . Firstly , there was the lashing of Gannicus . It was not good to lash gladiators , but at the same time , the discipline of a school had to be the most stringent discipline in the world . The breaking of any small feature of discipline by a gladiator had to be punished ? and punished quickly and mercilessly . Secondly , there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pitted against net and fork . Thirdly , there was the fighting itself . Batiatus was waiting at the arena for the guests to arrive . Regardless of what Batiatus thought of these Romans in a  | personal sense , there was an honor due to money which he was keenly aware of . Whenever he encountered a millionaire ? not merely a man who had millions but one who could spend millions  --  he was overwhelmed by his own sense of being so small a frog in so small a puddle . When he was a gang leader on the streets of the urbs , his own dream was to accumulate the 400,000 sesterces which would entitle him to admittance into the order of knighthood . When he became a knight , however , he first began to realize what wealth meant , and for all he had climbed  --  by his own shrewdness too  --  there was an endless vista of ladder ahead of him . Honor where honor is due . That is why he waited here for Caius and Bracus and the others ; and thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , he escorted the honored guests to the box which had been prepared for them , a box built just high enough to view every corner of the little arena without craning or stretching . He himself adjusted the pillows of their couches , so that they might recline in the greatest ease and comfort as they watched the fighting . Cool wine was brought to them and little pots of sweetmeats and honied squab , so that thirst and appetite might always be satisfied . A striped awning protected them from the morning sun , and two household slaves stood by with feather fans , in case the coolness of the morning should give way to a sultry forenoon . As he superintended the arrangement of the scene , Batiatus 's heart swelled with pride  --  for certainly , here was all that anyone , no matter how delicate his tastes , could ask . And to fill in the boredom between now and the moment when the game began , there were two musicians and a dancing girl on the floor of the arena . Not that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were keyed higher than that , and the married friend of Bracus  --  Cornelius Lucius was his name  --  prattled nervously of what one needed to live decently in Rome 112  | these days . Batiatus lingered and listened ; he was eager to know what one needed to live decently in Rome these days , and the conversation caught him when he learned that Lucius had paid 5,000 denarii for a new libarius , a fortune for a man to bake pastry . " But one ca n't live like a pig  --  or can one ? " asked Lucius . " Or even the way my father lived . If one wants to eat decently , one needs at least four , the pastry cook , the cocus , the pistores and certainly a dulciarius , or else one sends to the market for cooked sweets and one could just as well do without that . " " I do n't see how one could do without that , " his wife said . " Every month a new tonsores ; no one but a god could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairdresser or masseur ? " " It is not requiring a hundred slaves , " Bracus told her gently , " but training them  --  and even when you have trained them , I sometimes think that it 's hardly worth the effort . I have a privata for my clothes , a Greek from Cyprus who can quote you Homer by the hour . Mind you , he neither cleans nor washes . All I ask of him is that he keep some order among my clothes . I have a closet for cloaks . All I desire is that when I am through with a particular cloak , it should be placed in that closet . A tunic in the closet where my tunics are kept . One could train a dog to do that , no ? So if I say , Raxides , give me my yellow tunic , he can do it . But he ca n't do it . And it would take more time to teach him to do it properly than to do it myself . " " You ca n't do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course not . Child , see what kind of wine the lanista serves . " Batiatus was quicker . " Cisalpine , " he boasted , holding the jug before them . Bracus spat delicately , a finger alongside his nose . " How did you think of cushions , if I did n't say to you , we want cushions ? Do you have Judean wine , lanista ? "  | " Of course  --  the very best . A light rose  --  the lightest rose . " He screamed at one of the slaves to bring Judean wine immediately . " Tell him , " said Lucius to his wife , who was whispering to him . " No ? " Bracus stretched himself toward her , took her hand and pressed it to his lips . " Darling , is there anything you ca n't tell me ? " " I 'll whisper it . " She whispered it , and Bracus answered , " Of course , of course . " And then told Batiatus , " Bring the Jew here before he fights . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always eluded Batiatus . He knew there was such a thread , but for the life of him , he could not define it with any consistency , and he could not locate a rhyme or reason of pattern which would enable him to conceal his origin in a scheme of behavior . Each party which hired his arena for a private showing behaved differently ; how do you know ? Batiatus sent for the Jew . He came between two trainers and he walked to the box and stood there waiting . He was still wrapped in his long , rough woolen cloak , and his pale green eyes were like cold stones . He saw nothing out of those eyes . He just stood there The woman simpered . Caius was frightened . This was the first time a gladiator had ever stood within arm 's reach of him , with neither wall nor bars between them , and the two trainers were not sufficient to reassure him . This was nothing human , this Jew with the green eyes and the thin mouth , the fierce hooked nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cloak , lanista , " said Bracus . " Unclothe , " Batiatus whispered . The Jew stood there for a little while ; then , suddenly , he  | dropped his cloak and stood naked before them , his lean , muscular body as motionless as if it were carved from bronze . Caius stared fascinated . Lucius pretended to be bored , but his wife stared with her mouth slightly open , her breath coming hard and fast . " Animal bipes implume , " Bracus said tiredly . The Jew bent , retrieved his cloak , and turned away . The two trainers followed him . " Let him fight first , " Bracus said . VI At this time , it was not yet required by law that when Thracian or Jew fought in the arena with the traditional dagger , or perhaps better , the slightly-curved knife which was known as the sica , he should be given a wooden buckler for his defense , and even when that law was passed , it was frequently violated . The buckler , like the traditional brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife  --  which was the incredible play of motion and agility called forth from the gladiators . Until about forty years before this time  --  and until then the combat of pairs was fairly infrequent  --  the usual bout in the arena was called Samnites , and the pairs fought in heavy armor , carrying the great oblong shield of the legion , the scutum , and the Spanish sword , the spatha . This was neither very exciting nor very bloody , and the crash of shield against shield and sword against sword could go on for hours , without either of the pair being damaged particularly . At that time , too , the lanista was as despised as a procurer ? usually a petty gang leader who bought a few used-up slaves and let them hack . at each other until they fell dead of loss of blood or sheer exhaustion . Very often , the lanista was a procurer , dealing in gladiators with one hand and in prostitutes with the other . Two innovations revolutionized the fighting of pairs  --  and  | turned a dull spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a seat in the Senata , a country villa and a fortune of millions . The first was a result of Roman military and commercial penetration of Africa . The black man , fairly rare in the past , made his appearance in the slave market , the Negro in all his great height and strength . A lanista conceived the notion of giving him a fish net and fish fork , a triple-pointed fish spear , and putting him into the arena against sword and shield . Immediately , this caught the fancy of the Romans ; the games were no longer casual . The process was completed by the second innovation  --  which was the result of the penetration of Thrace and Judea and the discovery of two hardy , independent races of mountain peasants whose main weapon in war was a short , razor-sharp curved knife . Even more than the retiarii , the net-men , this transformed gladiatorial combat . Very rarely was buckler or body armor used . The lumbering crash of the Samnites was transformed into the lightning-like play of the dagger duels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pain and flashing motion . As Bracus put it to his young companion , " Once you have seen Thracians , you do n't want anything else , you know . Anything else is very dull , tedious and meaningless . Good Thracian play is the most exciting thing in the world . " It was time for the pairs . The dancing girl and the musicians had gone . The little arena was bare and empty in the hot morning sunshine . An aching , quivering silence hung over the whole place , and the four Romans , the lady and the three gentlemen , lay upon their couches under the striped awning , sipped at their rose-colored Judean wine , and waited for the game to begin . VII In the house of expectation , which was a little shed opening onto the arena , the three gladiators ; ; , , the two Thracians and  | the black man , sat and waited for the Jew to return . They sat on a bench without happiness ; they were consigned , as it was put . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor . And the black man said finally , breaking the silence which they had imposed upon themselves . " Quem di diligunt adolescens moritur . " If the gods love you , you die in childhood . " No , " said Spartacus . And then the black man asked him , " Do you believe in the gods ? " " No . " " Do you believe there is another place after we die here ? " " No . " " Then what do you believe in , Spartacus ? " the black man asked . " I believe in you and I believe in me . " " You and me , " said Polemus , the young , handsome Thracian , " we are meat on the butcher table of the lanista . " " What else do you believe in , Spartacus ? " the black man asked . " What else ? ? What does a man dream ? When a man is going to die , what does he dream ? " I tell you what I said before , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrowful in his chest , " and I tell you this . I am too lonely and too far from home and too bitter for home . I do n't want to live any more . I will not kill you , my comrade . " " Is this a place for mercy ? " " It 's a place for weariness , and I 'm tired . " " My father was a slave , " said Spartacus , " and he taught me the only virtue . The only virtue of a slave is to live . " " We can not both live . " " And the only kindness of life to a slave is that , like other people , he does n't know the time of his death . " Now the guards had heard them , and they hammered with  | their spears on the wall of the shed for silence . The Jew returned ; in any case , he would not have spoken ; he never spoke . He stood inside the door , cloaked , his head bent with sorrow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his underlip quivering with tension , and he and the Jew dropped their cloaks . The door opened , and naked , side by side , they walked into the arena . The black man was not interested . He was wedded to death . Fifty-two times , he had fought with net and spear and emerged alive , and now the cord that bound him to life had snapped . He sat on the bench with his memories , bowed over , his head in his hands ; but Spartacus leaped to the door and pressed his eye to a crack , so that he might see , so that he might know . He took no side ; the Thracian was of his people , but the Jew was something that tore his heart in a peculiar and strange way . When a pair fought to the death , one had to die , but the essence of the matter was life while life persisted . The essence of Spartacus was life . People recognized that in him . It was survival pitched onto the plane of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack which gave him a channel of vision down the center of the arena . His vision at first was blocked by the pair , but they dwindled in size as they walked to the center of the arena and faced those who had purchased their flesh and blood . Their shadows flowed behind them ; their bodies were dark and glistened with oil . Then they moved ten paces apart , and each stood framed at the edge of his vision , with the sand and sunlight between them . Spartacus could see the box where the Romans sat ; it defined the end of his vision , a broad , gay pavilion of pink and yellow and purple color , with its striped awning , the slow motion of the feather fans of the body slaves . There they sat , who had purchased life and death , the few and the mighty  --  and all the thoughts that must come to one  | man at least in every age of time , all of the thoughts came to Spartacus .. . Now the trainer , the master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a tray of polished wood , and he offered them symbolically to those who had paid the price of the game . As he slanted the tray toward them , the sun flashed from the polished metal of the blades , twelve inches of shining steel , razor-sharp , beautifully tooled and hafted in dark walnut . The knife was slightly curved , and the merest feather touch of the blade would split the skin . Bracus nodded , and hatred was like the touch of one of those knives on Spartacus , from head to foot  --  and then controlled and passionless as he watched the two gladiators select their weapons and then move apart outside of his field of vision . Yet he knew what their movements were ; every movement he knew . Eyeing each other with the wary horror and alertness of the condemned , they were each of them measuring the twenty paces of space allotted . Now they bent and rubbed sand onto the hilts , and onto the surface of their hands . Now they were crouched and every muscle was trembling like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trainer blew his silver whistle and the two gladiators re-emerged in Spartacus 's field of vision . Naked , crouched , each with the gleaming knife cradled in the palm of his right hand , they had shed their manhood . They were two animals . They circled like animals , shuffling their feet in short , flat steps on the hot sand . Then they closed and were apart in one convulsive motion , and the Romans were applauding and the Jew 's breast was marked with a thread of blood he wore like a sash . But neither of them seemed to be aware of the damage done . Their concentration upon each other was so intense , so absolute , so demanding that the whole world appeared to  | pivot upon them . Time ceased ; all of life and experience was concentrated upon each other , and the intensity with which they studied each other became something painful . And then again they came together in what seemed to be a single , integrated convulsion of force and decision , and then they were locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bound to each other , body to body , face to face , the locked wrists straining and screaming in silence the desire to close and cut and kill . Their transition was complete now ; they hated each other ; they knew only one purpose , the purpose of death , since only by killing could one of them live . Gripped together as they were , muscles rigid and straining , the two became one , one entity torn within itself . As long as flesh and blood could stand it , they strained in that grip , and then it broke and they tore apart , and now there was a ribbon of red the whole length of the Thracian 's arm . A dozen paces from each other , they stood panting and hating and trembling , each of them painted all over with blood and oil and sweat , the blood trickling down and staining the sand at their feet . Then the Thracian struck . Knife outstretched , he flung himself at the Jew , and the Jew went down on one knee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the air . And almost before the Thracian struck the ground , the Jew was upon him . It was the moment of supreme horror and extreme excitement in the game . Death was cutting at the Thracian . He twisted , rolled , convulsed , used his bare feet to ward off the terrible knife , but the Jew was all over him , cutting and stabbing  --  yet , such was the convulsive desperation of the young Thracian , unable to deliver a death blow . The Thracian found his feet ; his bleeding , torn body literally sprang into the air and on its feet and he stood there , but life and strength were running out of him . The explosion  | which brought him to his feet had tapped his deepest well of strength . He balanced with one hand , clutched the knife with the other , and swayed back and forth , probing at the air with his blade to ward off the Jew . But the Jew stood back and away from him , making no move to close again ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thracian was hamstrung , cut across face , hands , body and legs , and bleeding his life into the soggy spreading blot of the sand beneath his feet . Yet the supreme drama of life and death was not played out . The Romans awoke from their trance and they began to cry at the Jew , shrilly , hoarsely , demandingly , " Verbera ! Strike ! Strike ! " But the Jew did not move . He had only the single slash across his breast , but his motion had flung the blood all over his body . Now , he suddenly hurled his knife into the sand , where it stuck quivering . He stood there with his head bowed over . In just an instant , the opportunity would pass . The naked Thracian , who now wore a suit of red blood over every inch of his skin , sank to one knee . He had let go of his knife now , and he was dying quickly . The Romans screamed , and a trainer bounded across the arena , swinging a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fight , you scum ! " the trainer roared , and then the bullhide curled across the Jew 's back and around his belly . " Fight ! " The lash struck him again and again , but he did n't move , and then the Thracian rolled over on his face , quivered a little and began to moan with pain , low cries of pain at first , and then a rising crescendo , whipped out of his twisting body . Then the cries of pain stopped and he lay still ; then the trainer stopped whipping the Jew . The black man had joined Spartacus at the crack in the door . They watched without speaking .  | The soldiers approached the Thracian and prodded him with their spears . He moved a little . One of the soldiers unhooked a small but heavy hammer that hung from his belt . The other soldier wedged his spear under the Thracian and turned him over . Then the first soldier struck him a terrible blow upon the temple with his hammer , a blow which crushed in the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saluted the spectators with his brain-clotted hammer . At the same time , a second trainer led a donkey into the arena . The donkey wore a bright feather headdress and a leather harness from which a chain dragged . The chain was made fast to the Thracian 's feet , and the soldiers whipped the donkey with their spears , so that he cantered around the arena at a sharp trot , dragging the bloody , brain-dripping corpse after him . The Romans applauded this and the lady waved her lace handkerchief with delight . Then the bloody sand was turned over and smoothed , for the music and dancing before the next pair . VIII Batiatus had hurried into the box of his customers to make apology , to explain why , when he had been paid so well , the Jew had failed at the very end to kill the flesh in life , to sever an artery in throat or arm , so that the rich red blood could paint the proper finish to combat ; but Marius Bracus , holding a wine goblet in one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a word , lanista . It was delightful . It was sufficient . " " Yet I have a reputation . " " Devil take your reputation . But wait  --  I 'll tell you what . Bring the Jew here . No other punishment . When a man has fought well , that 's enough , is n't it ? Bring him here . " " Here ? Well , really , " Lucius began " Of course ! Do n't try to clean him up . Let him come as he is.  | While Batiatus went on the errand , Bracus held forth , attempting , as the connoisseur so often attempts , and with the same concession of futility , to explain the precise beauty and skill of what they had just seen . " If one sees that once in a hundred pairs , then one is fortunate . A moment of glory , better than an hour 's tedious fencing . That is the famous avis pacienda ad mortem . A flight to death  --  and how better could a gladiator die ? Consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is outpointed ? " " But he drew first blood , " Lucius objected . " Which means nothing . Most likely they never fought before . That was taking the measure . They must each make a series of passes to find each other . If they were evenly mated , they would fence , which would mean skill and endurance ; but when they locked , the Jew broke the lock and strung the Thracian 's arm . If it had been the right arm instead of the left , it would have ended there ; but as it was , the Thracian knew he was outpointed , and he staked all on a lunge  --  a body lunge . Nine out of ten gladiators would have blocked it and tried for a lock , yes and even taken a nasty cut to block it . Do you know what it means to parry one of those knives with all the weight of a man 's body behind it ? Why did I send for the Jew ? I 'll show you ? " While he was talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood and sweat , a wild , awful picture of a man standing before them , his head bent , his muscles still quivering . " Bend over ! " Bracus ordered him . The Jew did not move . " Bend ! " cried Batiatus . The two trainers who were with him took hold of the Jew and forced him over onto his knees before the Romans , and Bracus exclaimed triumphantly as he pointed to his back . " See there  --  there ! Not the whip marks . See where the skin  | is broken , as if a lady 's nail had scratched him . That 's where the Thracian 's knife touched him as he went under the lunge and flung him . Avis jacienda ad mortem ! Let him be , lanista , " Bracus told Batiatus . " No more whip . Let him be and you will have a fortune out of him . I 'll make him his reputation myself . A toast to you , gladiator ! " Bracus cried . But the Jew stood dumbly , his head hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black man , " and the sands we walk on whimper and whine in pain , but we do n't weep . " " We are gladiators , " answered Spartacus . " Do you have a heart of stone ? " " I am a slave . I suppose a slave should have a heart of stone or no heart at all . You have good things to remember , but I am koruu , and I have nothing at all to remember that is any good . " " Is that why you can watch this and not be moved ? " " It will not help me to be moved , " answered Spartacus dully . " I do n't know you , Spartacus . You are white and I am black . We are different . In my land , when a man 's heart fills with sorrow , he weeps . But in you Thracians , the tears have dried up . Look at me . What do you see ? " " I see a man weeping , " said Spartacus . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , Spartacus , I will not fight you . May they be damned and cursed and everlastingly cursed ! I will not fight you , I tell you . " " If we do n't fight , we both die , " Spartacus answered quietly . " Then kill me , my friend . I am tired of living . I am sick of living . " " Quiet in there ! " The soldiers hammered at the wall of the shed , but the black man turned and smashed his great fists against the wall until the whole shed shook . Then he stopped very suddenly and sat down on the bench and pillowed his face in his hands . Spartacus walked over to him and lifted  | his head and tenderly wiped the beads of sweat from his brow . " Gladiator , befriend no gladiator . " " Spartacus , why is man born ? " he whispered in agony . " To live . " " Is that the whole answer ? " " The only answer . " " I do n't understand your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend ? " Spartacus asked , almost pleadingly . " The child knows the answer , the moment it comes out of the womb . It is such a simple answer . " " No answer for me , " the black man said , " and my heart is breaking for those who used to love me . " " And others will love you . " " No more , " said the black man , " no more . " x In after years , Caius would not remember the morning of the two pairs in Capua with any great clarity . There were many sensations in his life ; sensations were bought and paid for , and Spartacus was only a Thracian name . Romans held that all Thracian names sounded alike , Gannicus , Spartacus , Menicus , Floracus , Leacus . Caius might have said , telling the story , that the Jew was also a Thracian , for the growing lore of the arena and the drug-like addiction of a whole people to the arena had given the term Thracian two meanings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the folk of the hundred tribes who lived in the southern section of the Balkan area , and by the Romans , used even more loosely to define any barbarian people east of the Balkans across the steppes to the Black Sea . Those close to Macedonia spoke Greek , but Greek was by no means a language of all who were called Thracians  --  even as the curved knife was by no means the common weapon of all those tribes . On the other hand , in the sporting language of the city  | of Rome and in the common slang of the arena , a Thracian was anyone who fought with the sica . Thereby , the Jew was a Thracian , for Caius neither knew nor cared that he came of the party of the Zealots , wild , stiff-necked peasants of the Judean hills , who had carried a banner of incessant rebellion and hatred for the oppressor ever since the old days of the Maccabees and the first agrarian war . Caius knew little of Judea and cared less ; the Jew was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the second pair would follow . The second pair was more unusual , but in his memories of what had happened to the black man he forgot the black man 's opponent . He remembered well , however , their entrance into the arena , the two of them walking from their cage and from the shadow into the bright , bleeding sunlight and onto the spotted yellow sand . The birds flew off  --  the bloodbirds , avis sanguinaria , the dainty little birds of spotted yellow who pecked so voraciously at the stained sand , filling their gullets . Like the sand , they were spotted yellow , and when they took flight , it was like gobs of sand flung into the air . The two men then halted at the appointed place . Here , do homage to those who have purchased your flesh and blood ; here is the moment when life is worthless , when dignity and shame alter the meaning of life . This is what is arrived at ; the mistress of the world amuses herself with blood . Caius would remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Africa , for that was an engraved picture on the sunlit background of yellow sand , on the unpainted wooden hoards of the amphitheatre ; but he would not remember what Bracus had said . Those words were small and inconsequential , and they washed away in the river of time . The petty whims of such men are never causes ; they only seem to be causes ; even Spartacus was not a cause , but the result of what was normal to Caius . And the whim which had led Bracus to plan this microcosmic orgy of death and  | suffering for the amusement of his empty-headed , worthless companion did not seem a whim to Caius , but rather a thing of great originality and excitement . So the pair did their homage and the Romans sipped wine and nibbled sweets . Then came the weapon-bearer . For Spartacus , the knife . For the black man , the long , heavy , threepronged fish fork and the fish net . They were both clowns in their shame and bloody degradation . The whole world had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweets and sip wine in the shady comfort of their box . The pair took the weapons . And then , as Caius saw it , the black man went mad . Madness was the only construction Caius could place upon it . Neither he nor Bracus nor Lucius could have made the journey to the black man 's beginnings , and only if they had made that journey would they have known that the black man did not go mad at all . Not even in mind could they have seen the house he had by a riverside and the children his wife bore him and the land he tilled and the fruit of the land , before the soldiers came and with them the slave dealers to harvest that crop of human life so magically transmuted into gold . So they only saw the black man go mad . They saw him cast his net aside and shout a wild warcry . And then they saw him hurtle toward the grandstand . A trainer with bared sword tried to stop him , and then the trainer , was squirming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hurled into the air like a fish , turning over and over and screaming in the air before he struck the ground . Now a six-foot fence barred the path of the black giant , but he tore the boards from it as if they were paper . He was transformed in his strength ; his strength made him like a weapon driving toward the box where the party sat . But now soldiers were running from the sides of the arena . The foremost soldier braced himself , legs spread on the sand ,  | and hurled his spear , the great wooden spear with the iron point which nothing in the world could resist , which had leveled the armies of a hundred nations . But it did not level the black man . The spear caught him in the back , the iron point driving through his chest and out of the front of him , yet it did n't halt him , and even with that monstrous wooden pole attached to his back , he clawed on toward the Romans . A second spear tore through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third spear entered his back and a fourth spear pierced his neck . Now at last , he was finished  --  yet the fork in his outstretched hand touched the rail of the box where the Romans cowered in terror . And there he lay with the blood gushing out of him and there he died . But it must be noted that through all of this , Spartacus had not moved . If he had moved , he would have died . He cast his knife into the sand , and remained without moving . Life is the answer to life .  | PART FOUR . Which concerns Marcus Tullius Cicero and his interest in the origin of the Great Servile War . If at the Villa Salaria , where a group of well-bred Roman ladies and gentlemen had come together for a night to partake of the thoughtful hospitality of a Roman plantation owner and gentleman , there was overmuch thought of Spartacus and the great revolt he had led , this was only to be expected . They had all of them reached the villa over the Appian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cicero coming north toward Rome on his way from Sicily , where , as quaestor , he held an important government post . Thus , their hour to hour travel was filled with the presence of the tokens of punishment , the stern and uncompromising signa poenae which told all the world that the Roman law was both merciless and just . Yet the least sensitive of human beings could not have travelled the great highway without pondering upon the series of terrible battles between slaves and free men which had shaken the Republic to its very roots  --  and indeed shaken the whole world which the Republic ruled . There was no slave on the plantation who did not toss uneasily in his sleep at the thought of so many like him hanging from the numberless crosses . It was a mighty passion , this particular crucifixion ,  | and the pain of six thousand men who died so slowly and so cruelly pervaded the whole countryside . That was only to be expected , and it was only to be expected that a young man as thoughtful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is worth remarking that men like Antonius Caius went out of their way to offer him a deference beyond what was due to his thirty-two years . It was not a question of lineage , of current family importance , or even of personal charm or ingratiating quality ; for even his friends did not consider Cicero to be particularly charming . Clever , he was , but others were just as clever . Specifically , Cicero was one of those young men  --  present in every age  --  who are capable of shedding every scruple , every ethic , every confusion of current morality , every impulse to ease conscience or guilt , every impulse of mercy or justice which might stand in the way of success . This should not imply that he was not concerned with justice , morality or mercy ; he was , but only in terms of self-advancement . Cicero was not merely ambitious , for ambition pure and simple could contain certain elements of emotion ; Cicero was coldly and shrewdly concerned with success  --  and if his calculations sometimes backfired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had not yet backfired at this time . He was the boy wonder who had practiced law at eighteen , fought a major campaign  --  purely for prestige and with no bodily danger ? in his twenties , and turning thirty , had stepped into an important administrative post of the government . His essays  --  on philosophy and government  --  and his orations were read and admired , and if he borrowed the thin substance they contained , most people were too ignorant to know from where he had stolen . He knew the right people and he estimated them carefully . At that time , most people in Rome searched  | for influential connections ; the prime virtue of Cicero was that he allowed nothing to interfere with his connections with the right people . Long ago , Cicero had discovered the profound difference between justice and morality . Justice was the tool of the strong , to be used as the strong desired ; morality , like the gods , was the illusion of the weak . Slavery was just ; only fools  --  according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the highroad , he could appreciate the awful suffering of the endless crucifixions , but he did not allow himself to be moved by them . He was working , at that time ? and he was always writing something  --  upon a short monograph on the series of servile wars which had shaken the whole world , and he was intensely interested in the various examples of slaves hanging along the Appian Way . He had perfected himself in interest without involvement , and he was able to study the various types , the Gauls , the Africans , the Thracians and the Jews and the Germans and the Greeks who composed the host of the crucified , without experiencing either sickness or pity . It occurred to him that in this vast passion there was a reflection of some new and mighty current which had come into the world  --  a current with ramifications which would stretch out into ages still unborn ; but it also occurred to him that in his own particular time , a person who could coldly observe and analyze and interpret this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique power . Cicero had only contempt for those who hated without understanding the subjective needs of the objects of their hatred . These were qualities in Cicero that some saw and others did not see . When Claudia arrived at the Villa Salaria that evening , she did not observe these qualities . The least complex type of strength was most understandable to Claudia . Helena , on the other hand , recognized and paid tribute . " I am like you , " her eyes said to Cicero . " Shall we pursue this ? "  | And when her brother lay in bed , awaiting the coming of a great general , she betook herself to Cicero 's chamber . She was full of the contrived dignity of a person who despises herself and takes comfort from the act , but why she should have felt inferior to this man who came from a money-grubbing upper middle class family , she could not have said . She could not have admitted , even to herself , that before the evening was done , she would do a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Cicero , however , she was a very desirable type of woman . Her tall , strong carriage , her fine , straight features and her intense dark eyes exemplified for him all the storied qualities of patrician blood . It was the particular goal toward which his own people had climbed for generations , yet found always unobtainable . And to find within such an exterior the qualities which brought a woman to a man 's chamber so late at night for only one obvious reason was singularly satisfying . At that time , it was a rare Roman who pursued his work into the night . The strangely unequal development of that society found one of its weakest spots in artificial lighting , and Roman lamps were poor , spluttering things which strained the eyes and gave at best a pale yellow glow . To work at night , therefore , especially at night after too much wine and food , was a specific sign of admirable or suspicious eccentricity  --  depending upon the person who did the work . With Cicero , it was rather admirable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helena entered his chamber , the amazing young man sat cross-legged on his bed , a scroll loosely open in his lap , noting and correcting . Perhaps the situation would have been too admittedly posed in terms of an older woman ; Helena was only twenty-three , and she was properly impressed . A leader in peace and a leader in war was still a constant of the old legends , and there  | were those Romans who were said to sleep only two or three hours a night , giving all the rest of their time to the nation . They were consecrated . She liked the idea that a consecrated man should have looked at her as Cicero had . Even before she had closed the door behind her , Cicero had nodded at the foot of his bed , for her to seat herself there  --  a matter of necessity , since there was no other comfortable place to sit in the room  --  and then he went on with his work . She closed the door and sat down on the bed . What now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life that no two men approached a woman in precisely the same way . But Cicero did not approach her at all , and after she had sat there for a quarter of an hour or so , she asked , " What are you writing ? " He looked at her inquiringly . The request was perfunctory ; it was a conversational opening , but Cicero wanted to talk . Like so many young men of his type , he perpetually awaited the woman who would understand him  --  which meant the woman who would feed his ego properly , and he asked Helena , " Why do you ask ? " " Because I want to know . " " I 'm writing a monograph on the servile wars , " he stated modestly . " You mean a history of them ? " It was at a time when historical writing by upper class gentlemen of leisure was just beginning to be fashionable , and many a newly arrived aristocrat was busily manipulating the early history of the Republic so that his ancestry and great events might mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , looking at the girl gravely and steadily , a manner he had whereby he could convey an impression of honesty and integrity ; notwithstanding his own process of simulation . " A history would involve a  | chronology . I am more interested in the phenomenon , the process . If one looked at those crosses , those tokens of punishment which line the Appian Way , one could see only the dead bodies of six thousand men . One might conclude that we Romans are a vindictive people , and it is not enough to say that we are a just people , invoking the necessity of justice . We must explain , even to ourselves , the logic of this justice . We must understand . It was not enough for the old man to say delenda est Carthago . That is demagoguery . For my part , I would have wanted to understand why Carthage must be destroyed and why six thousand slaves must be put to death in such a fashion . " " Some say , " Helena smiled , " that if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very respectable fortunes would have been wiped out . " " A little truth and a lot of untruth , " Cicero replied . " I want to see beyond the superficial . I want to see the meaning of slave revolt . Delusion has become a great Roman pastime ; I do n't like to delude myself . We talk of this war and that war , of great campaigns and great generals , but none of us want even to whisper about the constant warfare of our time which overshadows all other warfare , the servile war , the revolt of the slaves . Even the generals concerned hush-hush it . There is no glory in servile war . There is no glory in the conquest of slaves . " " But surely it is n't an affair of such consequence . " " No ? And were the crucifixions of no consequence to you as you came down the Appian Way ? " " It was quite sickening . I do n't enjoy looking at such things . My friend Claudia does . " " In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spartacus and his war . " " Do they ? I 'm not so sure . I 'm not so sure that even Crassus knows a great deal . Spartacus is a mystery as far as we  | are concerned . According to the official records , he was a Thracian mercenary and highwayman . According to Crassus , he was a born slave out of the gold mines of Nubia . Whom do we believe ? Batiatus , the swine who kept the school at Capua , is dead  --  his throat cut by a Greek slave who was his bookkeeper  --  and so is every other contact with Spartacus dead or gone . And who will write about him ? People like myself . " " Why not people like yourself ? " asked Helena . " Thank you , my dear . But I know nothing of Spartacus . I only hate him . " " Why ? My brother hates him too . " " And do n't you hate him ? " " I do n't feel anything in particular , " said Helena . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he ? And how does a slave become what Spartacus became ? That is the mystery I must solve . To find out where this began and why it began . But I 'm afraid I bore you ? " There was an air of sincerity about Cicero which people caught and believed , and which made them defend him against all the charges hurled at him in later years . " Please go on talking , " said Helena . The young men she knew in Rome who were Cicero 's age talked about the latest perfumes , the gladiator they were betting on , the particular horse they were backing , or their latest mistress or concubine . " Please go on , " she said . " I do n't wholly trust rhetoric , " Cicero said . " I like to write things down and let them fall into place . I 'm afraid most people feel as you do , that the rising of slaves is of no great consequence . But , you see , our whole lives are concerned with slaves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our conquests . Can you believe that ? " She shook her head . " I can prove it , you know . About a hundred and twenty  | years ago it began  --  with the rising of the Carthaginian slaves we had made captive . Then , two generations later , the great revolt of the slaves in the mines of Laurium in Greece . Then the mighty revolt of the miners in Spain . Then , a few years later , the revolt of Sicilian slaves , which shook the republic to its roots . Then , twenty years later , the servile war led by the slave Salvius . These are only the great wars , but in between are a thousand smaller uprisings  --  and the whole thing together is a single war , a continuing , unending war between ourselves and our slaves , a silent war , a shameful war that no one speaks of and the historians are unwilling to record . We 're afraid to record it , afraid to look at it ; because it 's something new on earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even wars between brothers  --  but this is a new monster inside of us , inside our guts and against all parties , all nations , all cities . " " You frighten me , " said Helena . " Do you know what kind of a picture you make ? " Cicero nodded and looked searchingly at her . She was moved to cover his hand with hers , and she felt a rich , outgoing sense of warmth toward him . Here was a young man , not too much older than herself , who was deeply concerned with matters concerning the fate and future of the nation . It reminded her of the stories she had heard of the old times , vaguely-remembered stories of her childhood . Cicero laid his manuscript aside and began to stroke her hand gently , and then he leaned over and kissed her . Vividly , now , she recalled the tokens of punishment , the rotting , bird-eaten , sun-baked flesh of the men who were crucified along the Appian Way ; only now it was no longer horrible ; Cicero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of her , she could not recall the content of his rationale . " We are a most singular people , filled with a great capacity for love and justice , " thought Cicero . He felt , as he began to  | make love to Helena , that here was a woman at last who understood him . Yet that did not lessen the sense of power a conquest of her afforded him . Quite to the contrary , he felt himself full of power , the extension of power  --  and it was that very extension , if the truth must be told , which comprised the logic of what he wrote . In a moment of mystical revelation , he saw the power of his loins joined with that power which had crushed Spartacus , and would crush him again and again . Looking at him , Helena realized suddenly , and with horror , that his face was full of hate and cruelty . As always , she submitted with fear and self-loathing . II Out of sheer weariness and emotional upheaval , Helena slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with a man , turned into a strange and disturbing dream . The dream combined reality and unreality in a manner which made them difficult to separate . In her dream , she recalled the time in the streets of Rome when her brother , Caius , had pointed out to her Lentulus Batiatus , the lanista . That was only about seven months'ago , and only a few days before Batiatus had his throat cut by his Greek bookkeeper ? as gossip had it , in a quarrel over a woman the Greek had purchased with money stolen from the lanista . Batiatus had had made something of a reputation for himself through his connection with Spartacus . This time , he was in Rome to defend himself in a lawsuit over one of his tenements ; the house had collapsed , and the surviving families of six tenants who were killed were suing him . In her dream , she recalled him very well and normally , a huge , waddling product of overeating and dissipation , who would not hire a litter , but walked all wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving off street urchins who begged for alms , with a cane he carried . Later ,  | that same day , she and Caius stopped at the Forum and just by chance happened in at the court where Batiatus was defending himself . This , in the dream , was much the same as it had been in life . The court was being held out of doors . It swarmed with spectators , idlers , women with endless time on their hands , young men about town , children , people from other lands who could not leave the great urbs without witnessing the famous Roman justice , slaves on their way to or from some errand  --  indeed it seemed a miracle that any reason , much less justice , could be extracted from such a throng ; but this was how the courts proceeded , week in and week out . Batiatus was being questioned , and he answered the questions in a bull-like roar , and all of this was as it had been in her actual experience . But then , as happens in dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bedchamber and watching the Greek bookkeeper approach with bared knife . The knife was the curved sica which Thracians fight with in the arena , and the floor of the bedchamber was also arena , or sand , since both are the same word in Latin . The Greek minced across the sand with all the wary poise of a Thracian , and the lanista , awake and sitting up in his bed , watched him with horror . But no word or sound from anyone . Then , alongside the Greek , a giant figure appeared , a mighty , bronzed man in full armor , and Helena knew immediately that this was Spartacus . His hand closed over the bookkeeper 's wrist and squeezed just a trifle , and the knife fell to the sand . Then the bronzed , handsome giant who was Spartacus , nodded at Helena , and she picked up the knife and cut the lanista 's throat . The Greek and the lanista then disappeared , and she was left with the gladiator ; but when she opened her arms to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heel , and walked off . Then she ran after him , whimpering and pleading for him to wait for her , but he had disappeared , and she was alone in a boundless space of sand .  | III It was an ugly and cheap death which actually had overtaken Batiatus , the lanista , to be murdered by his own slave ; and perhaps he would have avoided that and many other things if , after the abortive performance of the two pairs for Bracus , he had put to death both gladiators who survived . If he had done that , he would have been entirely within his rights ; for it was an accepted practice to kill gladiators who sowed dissension . But it is questionable whether it would have changed history too much if Spartacus had perished . The forces which prodded him would simply have turned elsewhere . Just as the dream of Helena , the Roman maiden sleeping her guilt-ridden sleep at the Villa Salaria so long afterwards , concerned not him specifically , but the slave who takes up the sword , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood-ridden memories and hopes shared by so many of his profession , the gladiators , the men of the sword . That would answer those who could not understand how the plot of Spartacus had been hatched . It was not hatched by pne , but by many . Varinia , the German girl , his wife , sat by him as he slept , kept awake by his moans and by his frantic talking in his sleep . He talked of a great many things . Now he was a child and now he was in the gold mines , and now he was in the arena . Now the sica had split his flesh and he screamed with pain . When that happened , she woke him , for the nightmare he had been living in his sleep was impossible for her to endure any longer . She awakened him and made love to him tenderly , stroking his brow and kissing his wet skin . When Varinia had been a little girl , she saw what happened to men and women in her tribe when they knew love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear ; even the devils and spirits of the great forests where her people lived knew that those who loved  | were invulnerable to fear , and you could see that in the eyes of people who loved and in the way they walked and in the way their fingers intertwined . But after she had been taken captive , she had forgotten such memories , the prime instinct of her existence had become hatred . Now her whole being , the life within her , her being and her existence , her living and functioning , the motion of her blood and the beating of her heart were fused into love for this Thracian slave . Now she knew that the experience of the men and women in her tribe was very true and very ancient and very expressive . She no longer was afraid of anything on earth . She believed in magic , and the magic of her love was real and provable . At the same time , she realized that her man was an easy man to love . He was one of those rare human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first thing one saw in Spartacus , his wholeness . He was singular . He was content , not il where he was but in what he was as a human being . Even in this nest of terrible , desperate and doomed men  --  in. this murder school of condemned murderers , army deserters , . lost souls and miners whom the mines could not destroy , Spartacus was loved and honored and respected . But her love was something else . All of him was the essence of men and the being of men for women . She had believed that the desire in her loins was dead forever , but she had only to touch him to want him . Everything about him was the special way in which men should be formed , if she were the sculptor and had to do the forming . His broken nose , his large brown eyes and his full , mobile mouth were as different from the faces of the men she had known in her childhood as a face could be , but she could not conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like Spartacus . Why he should be as he was , she did not know . She had been long enough a part of the cultured , genteel life of the  | Roman aristocracy to know what their men were , but why a slave should be what Spartacus was , she did not know . Now her hands quieted him , and she asked him , " What were you dreaming ? " He shook his head . " Hold me close to you and you wo n't dream anymore . " He held her close to him and whispered to her , " Do you ever think that we might not be together ? " " Yes . " " And then what will you do , my darling ? " he asked her . " Then I will die , " she answered simply and directly . " I want to talk to you about that , " he said , awake out of his dream now and calm again . " Why should we think of it or talk about it ? " " Because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die if I died or was taken away from you . " " Do you think that way ? " " Yes . " " And if I died , you would not want to die ? " she asked . " I would want to live . " " Why ? " " Because there is nothing without life . " " There is no life without you , " she said . " I want you to make me a promise and to keep it . " " If I make a promise , I will keep it . Otherwise , I wo n't make it . " " I want you to promise that you will never take your own life , " said Spartacus . She did n't answer him for a time . " Will you promise ? " Finally , she said , " All right , I will . " Then , in a little while , he was asleep , calmly and gently , with her arms around him .  | Iv The morning drumbeat summoned them to exercise . There was forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal . Each man on awakening was given a glass of cold water . His cell door was opened . If he had a woman , she was permitted to clean the cell before she went to work as a part of the slave population of the school . There was no waste in the institution of Lentulus Batiatus . The women of the gladiators scrubbed and cleaned and cooked and tilled the kitchen gardens and worked in the baths and tended the goats , and on these women Batiatus was as hard a master as any plantation owner , using the whip freely and abundantly and feeding them cheap mash . But of Spartacus and Varinia , he had a curious fear ; although he would hardly have been able to say what there was in them that he feared and why he feared it . On this particular and remembered morning , however , there was a note of impatience and hatred through the school , in the reveille drums , in the way the trainers drove the men from their cells into the enclosure , lining them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucified in death ; and the women were whipped to their tasks with the same nervous hatred . There was no fear of Varinia this morning , nor was the whip any lighter on her than on others . If anything , she was singled out by the overseer with special comments about the whore of the great warrior . And the whip touched her more often than others . She worked in the kitchen , to where she was driven . It was the anger of Batiatus which pervaded the place , a deep and trembling anger which arose out of the one thing which could most successfully anger the lanista , a financial loss . Bracus had withheld half of the agreed price , and although there would be a lawsuit and all the trimmings , Batia-  | his knew what the chances were of his winning a lawsuit against a prominent Roman family in a Roman court . The results of his anger were everywhere in the place . In the kitchen , the cook cursed the women and beat them to their work with his long wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer , lashed the gladiators , and the black man in death was stretched onto the enclosure fence , to confront the gladiators as they shaped up for their morning drill . Spartacus took his place , Gannicus on one side of him , a Gaul called Crixus on the other side . They made two lines across the face of the cellblock , and the trainers who faced them this morning were heavily armed , specially armed with knife and sword . The gates of the enclosure were opened , and four squads of regular troops , forty men , stood there at attention , their big wooden darts swinging in their fists at their sides . The morning sun flooded the yellow sand and touched the men with its warmth , but there was no warmth in Spartacus , and when Gannicus whispered to him whether he knew what this meant , he shook his head silently . " Did you fight ? " the Gaul asked . " No . " " " But he did n't kill any of them , and if a man is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Will you die any better than that ? " asked Spartacus . " He 'll die like a dog and so will you , " said Crixus the Gaul . " He 'll die in the sand with his belly open , and so will you . " It was then that Spartacus began to realize what he must do ; or it could be better said that the realization , with him so long , solidified into a reality . The reality was only beginning ; the reality would never be any more than a beginning with him , the end or endlessness of it stretching into the unborn future ; but the reality was connected with all that had happened to him and the men around him and with all that was going to happen now . He stared at the great body of the  | Negro , lashed out in the sun , the skin and flesh torn where the pila had driven through it , the blood clotted and dry , the head hanging between the broad shoulders . What a contempt for life these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what a lusty delight they take in death ! Yet why not , he asked himself , when the whole process of their living was built on the blood and bones of his own kind ? Crucifixion had a particular fascination for them . It had come from Carthage , where the Carthagenians had adopted it as the only death fitting for a slave ; but where Rome 's fingers reached , crucifixion became a passion . Batiatus came into the enclosure now , and Spartacus , barely moving his lips , asked the Gaul who stood beside him , " And how will you die ? " " The way you will , Thracian . " " He was my friend , " said Spartacus of the dead Negro , " and he loved me . " " That 's your curse . " Batiatus took his place before the long line of gladiators and the soldiers gathered behind him . " I feed you , " said the lanista . " I feed you the best , roasts and chickens and fresh fish . I feed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I massage you . I took the lot of you from the mines and the gallows , and here you live like kings in idleness on the fat of the land . There was nothing lower than what you were before you came here , but now you live in comfort and you eat the best . " " Are you my friend ? " whispered Spartacus , and the Gaul answered , barely moving his lips , " Gladiator , make no friends of gladiators . " " I call you friend , " said Spartacus . Batiatus now said , " In the black heart of that black dog , there was neither gratitude nor understanding . How many of you are like him ? "  | The gladiators stood in silence . " Pick me a black man ! " said Batiatus to the trainers , and they went to where the Africans stood and dragged one out to the center of the enclosure . It had been arranged in advance . The drums began to roll , and two soldiers separated themselves from the others and lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Negro struggled convulsively and the soldiers drove their spears one after another through his breast . He lay on his back in the sand , the two spears angled curiously . Batiatus turned to the officer who stood beside him , and said , " Now there will be no more trouble . The dogs will not even growl . " " I call you friend , " said Gannicus to Spartacus , and the Gaul who stood on the other side of him said nothing , only breathing heavily and hoarsely . Then the morning drill began . v Afterward , at a Senatorial Board of Inquiry , Batiatus claimed , quite truthfully , that not only did he not know that a plot had been hatched , but that he did not believe it possible for one to be hatched . In support of this , he pointed out that there were always at least two among the gladiators who were in his pay with his promise of manumission . At intervals , these two would be paired out to fight for hire . One would be freed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of combat , and then a new informer would be recruited for the pair . Batiatus insisted that a plot could not have been hatched without his knowledge . Thus it was always , and no matter how often revolt broke out among the slaves , there was no locating it , no pinning it down , no finding the continuous root of it , which unquestionably , like the roots of strawberries , was continuous and in-  | visible , whereas only the flowering plant could be seen . Whether it was revolt in Sicily on a grand scale or an abortive attempt on a plantation , which ended in the crucifixion of a few hundred miserable wretches , the attempt of the Senate to dig up the roots failed . Yet the roots had to be dug up . Here men had created a splendor of life and luxury and abundance never known in the world before ; the warring of nations had ended in the Roman Peace ; the separation of nations had ended with the Roman roads ; and in the mighty urban center of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as it should be , as all and each and every one of the gods had planned it to be , yet with the flowering of the body had come this disease which could not be rooted out . Whereby the Senate asked Batiatus , " Were there no signs of conspiracy , discontent , plotting ? " " There were none , " he insisted . " And when you executed the African  --  mind you , we consider your action quite proper  --  was there no protest ? " " None . " " We are particularly interested in whether any sort of outside help , foreign provocation of any sort could have entered into this matter ? " " It is impossible , " said Batiatus . " And there was no outside help or funds provided for the triumvirate of Spartacus , Gannicus and Crixus ? " " I can swear by all the gods there were not , " said Batiatus . VI Yet this was not wholly true , and no man is alone . It was the incredible strength of Spartacus that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not too long before the abortive fighting of the two pairs , which the wealthy young Roman , Marius Bracus , had contracted for , there was a rising of slaves on three great plantations in Sicily . Nine  | hundred slaves were involved and all except a handful were put to death , and it was only at the tail end of blood-letting that the owners realized how much cold cash was going down the drain . Thereby , almost a hundred survivors were sold into the galleys for a mere pittance , and it was in a galley that one of Batiatus 's agents saw the huge , broad-shouldered , redheaded Gaul whose name was Crixus . Since galley slaves were considered incorrigibles , the price was cheap and even the bribes which promoted the transaction were small , and since the slave dealers who controlled the naval docks at Ostia did not look for trouble , they said nothing of the origin of Crixus . Whereby Spartacus was neither alone nor disconnected with many threads which wove a particular fabric . Crixus was in the cell next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length on the floor of his cell , his head near the door , Spartacus heard the story from Crixus of the endless warfare of the Sicilian slaves , which had begun more than half a century before . He , Spartacus , was a slave and born out of slaves , but here among his own kind were legendary heroes as splendid as Achilles and Hector and Odysseus the wise , as splendid and even prouder , though no songs were sung of them and they were not turned into gods which men worshipped . Which was well enough , for the gods were like the rich Romans and as little concerned with the lives of slaves . These were men and less than men , slaves , naked slaves who were cheaper on the market than donkeys , and who put their shoulders into harness and dragged ploughs across the fields of the latifundia . But what giants they were ! Eunus , who freed every slave on the island and smashed three Roman armies before they dragged him down , Athenion the Greek , Salvius the Thracian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joash , who had escaped in a boat from Carthage and joined Athenion with his entire crew . Listening , Spartacus would feel his heart swell in pride and  | joy , and a great and cleansing sense of brotherhood and communion toward these dead heroes would come over him . His heart went out to these comrades of his ; he knew them well ; he knew what they felt and what they dreamed and what they longed for . Race , city or state had no meaning . Their bondage was universal . Yet for all the pitiful splendor of their revolts , they always failed ; always it was the Romans who nailed them to the cross , the new tree and the new fruit , so that all might see the rewards for a slave who would not be a slave . " In the end it was always the same , " Crixus said .. . So the longer he was a gladiator , the less Crixus spoke of what had been . Neither the past nor the future can help the gladiator . For him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cynicism around himself , and only Spartacus dared to probe at the bitter shell of the giant Gaul . And once Crixus had said to him , " You make too many friends , Spartacus . It 's hard to kill a friend . Leave me alone . " On this morning , after the drill , they were grouped together for a while in the enclosure before going to the morning meal . Hot and sweating , the gladiators stood or squatted in little groups , their talk muffled by the presence of the two Africans who now hung crucified on the fence . There was a fresh pool of blood under the one who had been selected as a token of punishment for the other , and the blood birds pecked and gobbled the sweet stain . The gladiators were sullen and subdued . It was only the beginning , they felt . Batiatus would now contract and fight them as quickly as he could . It was a bad time . The soldiers had gone off to eat in a little grove of trees , across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from within the enclosure , could see them there , sprawled on the ground , their helmets off , their heavy weapons stacked . He never took his eyes off them .  | " What do you see ? " asked Gannicus . They had been slaves a long time together , together in the mines , together as children . " I do n't know . " Crixus was sullen ; violence had been too long capped inside of him . " What do you see , Spartacus ? " he also asked . " I do n't know . " " But you know all , do n't you , and for that the Thracians call you father . " " Who do you hate , Crixus ? " " Did the black man also call you father , Spartacus ? Why did n't you fight him ? Will you fight me when our turn comes , Spartacus ? " " I will fight no more gladiators , " said Spartacus quietly . " That I know . I did n't know it a little while ago , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had heard his words . They gathered close to him now . He no longer looked at the soldiers ; he looked at the gladiators instead . He looked from face to face . The half dozen became eight and ten and twelve , and still he said nothing ; but their sullenness went away , and there was a demanding excitement in their eyes . He looked into their eyes . " What will we do , father ? " asked Gannicus . " We will know what to do when the time comes to do it . Now break this up . " " Then time telescoped , and a thousand years were upon the Thracian slave . All that had not happened in a thousand years would happen in the next few hours . Now again , for the moment , they were slaves  --  the dregs of slavery , the butchers of slavery . They moved toward the gates of the enclosure and then they marched to the mess hall for the morning meal . At this point , they passed Batiatus in his litter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cultured bookkeeper ,  | both of them on their way to the market in Capua to purchase provisions . As they passed the ranks of gladiators , Batiatus noticed how evenly and with what discipline they marched , and he considered that even if the sacrifice of an African had been an unwonted expense , it was entirely justified . Thereby , Batiatus lived , and his bookkeeper lived to slit his master 's throat in time to come . VII What happened in the dining room  --  or mess hall , it would be better called  --  where the gladiators gathered to eat , would never properly be known or told ; for there were no historians to record the adventures of slaves , nor were their lives considered worthy of record ; and when what a slave did had to become a part of history , the history was set down by one who owned slaves and feared slaves and hated slaves . But Varinia , working in the kitchen , saw it with her own eyes , and long afterwards she told the tale to another  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of such a thing dies away to a whisper , it is never wholly lost . The kitchen was at one end of the mess hall . The doors which led to it were at the other . The mess hall itself was an improvisation of Batiatus . Many Roman buildings were built in a traditional form , but the training and hiring of gladiators on a mass scale was a product of this generation , as was the craze for the fighting of pairs , and the question of schooling and controlling so many gladiators was a new question . Batiatus took an old stone wall and added three sides to it . The quadrangle thus formed was roofed in the old fashioned manner , a wooden shed projecting inward on all sides for a width of about eight feet . The central part was left open to the sky , and the inside was paved to a central drain , where rain water could run off . This method of construction was more common a century before , but in  | the mild climate of Capua it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often damp . The gladiators ate cross-legged on the floor under the shed . The trainers paced the open court in the center , where they could watch all most easily . The kitchen , which consisted of a long brick and tile oven and a long work table , was at one end of the quadrangle , open to the rest of it ; a pair of heavy wooden doors were at the other end , and once the gladiators were inside , these doors were bolted . So it happened this day , in the routine fashion , and the gladiators took their places and were served by the kitchen slaves , almost all of them women . Four trainers paced in the center court . The trainers carried knives and short whips of plaited leather . The doors were duly bolted from the outside by two soldiers who were detached from the platoon for this duty . The rest of the soldiers were eating their morning meal in a pleasant grove of trees about a hundred yards away . All this Spartacus saw and noted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammered at his breast . No great thing was being made , as he saw it , and there was no more of the future open to him than to any other man . But some men come to a point where they say to themselves , " If I do not do such and such a thing , then there is no need or reason for me to live any more . " And when many men come to such a point , then the earth shakes . It was to shake a little before the day was over , before this morning gave way to noon and nightfall ; but Spartacus did not know this . He only knew the next step , and that was to talk to the gladiators . As he told that to Crixus , the Gaul , he saw his wife , Varinia , watching him as she stood before the stove . Other gladiators watched him too . The Jew , David , read the motion of his lips . Gannicus leaned his ear near to him . An African called Phraxus leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speak , " said Spartacus . " I want to  | open my heart . But when I speak , there is no going back , and the trainers will try to stop me . " " They wo n't stop you , " said Crixus , the giant red headed Gaul . Even across the quadrangle , the currents were felt . Two trainers turned toward Spartacus and the crouching men around him . They snapped their whips and drew their knives . " Speak now ! " cried Gannicus . " Are we dogs that you snap whips at us ? " said the African . Spartacus rose to his feet , and dozens of gladiators rose with him . The trainers lashed out with their whips and knives , but the gladiators swarmed over them and killed them quickly . The women killed the cook . In all this , there was little noise , only a low growl from the milling gladiators . Then Spartacus gave his first command , gently , softly , unhurriedly , telling Crixus and Gannicus and David and Phraxus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I may speak . " It was in the balance for just an instant , but then they obeyed him , and when he led them afterwards , for the most part they heeded what he said . They loved him . Crixus knew that they would die , but it did n't matter , and the Jew , David , who had felt nothing for so long , felt a rush of warmth and love for this strange , gentle , ugly Thracian with the broken nose and the sheep-like face . VIII " Gather around me , " he said . It had been done so quickly , and there was still no sound from the soldiers stationed outside . The gladiators and the slaves from the kitchen  --  thirty women and two men  --  pressed around him , and Varinia stared at him with fear and hope and awe and pressed toward him . They made a passage for her ; she went over to him , and he put an arm around her and held her tight against his side , thinking to himself ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom for my father or grandfather , but right now I stand here a free man . " It was something to make him drunk , and he felt it rush through him like wine . But along with it , there was the fear . It is no light thing to be free ; it is no small thing to be free when you have been a slave for a very long time , for all the time that you have known and all the time your father has known . There was also , in Spartacus , the subdued and willful terror of a man who has made an unalterable decision and who knows that every step along the path he takes , death waits . And lastly , a great questioning of himself , for these men whose trade was killing had killed their masters , and they were full of the awful doubt which comes over a slave who has struck at his master . Their eyes were upon him . He was the gentle Thracian miner who knew what was in their hearts and came close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignorance , as most folk of that time were , they felt that some god  --  a strange god with a little pity in his heart  --  had touched him . Therefore , he must contrive with the future and read it as a man reads a book , and lead them into it ; and if there were no roads for them to travel , he must make roads . All this , their eyes told him ; all this , he read in their eyes . " Are you my people ? " he asked them , when they were pressed close around him . " I will never be a gladiator again . I will die first . Are you my people ? " The eyes of some of them filled with tears , and they pressed even closer to him . Some were more afraid , and some were less afraid , but he touched them with a little bit of glory ? which was a wonderful thing he was able to do . " Now we must be comrades , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old times , among my people  --  as I heard it told  --  when they went out to fight , they went with their own good will , not like the Romans go , but with their  | own good will , and if someone did not want to fight , he went away , and no one looked after him . " " What will we do ? " someone cried . " We will go out and fight , and we will make a good fight , for we are the best fighting men in the whole world . " Suddenly , his voice rang out , and the contrast to his gentle manner of before transfixed and held them ; his voice was wild and loud , and surely the soldiers outside heard him cry , " We will make a fighting of pairs so that in all the time of Rome , they will never forget the gladiators of Capua ! " There comes a time when men must do what they must , and Varinia knew this , and she was proud with a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of singular joy , for she had a man who was like no other in all the world . She knew about Spartacus ; in time , all the world would know about him , but not precisely as she knew about him . She knew , somehow , that this was the beginning of something mighty and endless , and her man was gentle and pure and there was no other like him . IX " First the soldiers , " said Spartacus . " We are five to one , and maybe they will run away . " " They will not run away , " he answered angrily . " You must know that about the soldiers , that they will not run away . Either they will kill us or we will kill them , and if we kill them , there will be others . There is no end to the Roman soldiers ! " When they looked at him as they did , he told them , " But there is also no end to the slaves . " Then they made their preparations very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from the kitchen they took everything that could be used as weapons , the knives and cleavers and spits and roasting forks and pestles ,  | particularly the pestles , which were used for grinding grain for porridge and of which there were at least twenty , wooden rods with a heavy lump of wood at the end ; and they could be used either as clubs or as things to throw . They took the firewood too , and a man took a meat bone if there was nothing else , and they took pot covers to use as shields . In one way or another , they had weapons , and then , with the women behind them , they threw back the big doors of the mess hall and went out to fight . They had moved very quickly , but not quickly enough to surprise the soldiers . The two who had been on guard had warned them , and they had sufficient time to put on their armor and to form in four maniples of ten , and now they stood in their formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two officers , and a dozen trainers , armed as the soldiers were , heavily , with sword , shield and spear . Thus , fiftyfour heavily armed men faced the two hundred naked and almost unarmed gladiators . It was unequal odds , but the odds were on the side of the soldiers , and they were Roman soldiers , against whom nothing on earth could stand . They hefted their spears and they moved forward on the double , one maniple after another . Their officers ' orders came high and clear on the morning breeze , and they swept forward like a broom to clear this dirt from their path . Their high-stepping booted feet splashed in the water of the brook . The wild flowers bent aside as they mounted the bank , and from all over the place , the remaining slaves came running out and clustered in knots , to see this incredible thing that was happening . The terrible pila rocked back on bent arms , the iron points sparkling in the sunshine , and by all that Roman power meant , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented , the slaves should have broken and run , ashes to ashes and dirt to dirt . But at that moment the Roman power was at bay ; and  | Spartacus became a commander . There is no clear definition for a man who leads other men ; leadership is rare and intangible , the more so when it is not backed with power and glory . Any man can give orders , but to give them so that others will listen is a quality , and that was a quality of Spartacus . He ordered the gladiators to spread out , and they spread out . He ordered them to make a wide loose circle around the maniples , and they made such a circle . Now the four charging maniples slowed their pace . Indecision seized them . They halted . No soldiers on earth could match the pace of gladiators , where life was speed and speed was life , and except for their loin cloths , these gladiators were naked  --  whereas the Roman footsoldiers were burdened with the great weight of sword , spear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad circle , a hundred and fifty yards across , in the center of which were the maniples , turning here and there , hefting the pile  --  which was worthless at a range of more than thirty or forty yards . The Roman spear could be thrown only once ; one throw and then close in . But what to throw at here ? In that moment , with startling clarity , Spartacus saw his tactics , the whole pattern of his tactics in the years to come . He saw in his mind 's eye , briefly and vividly , the logic of all the tales told of armies which had hurled themselves against those iron points of Rome , to be smashed under the mighty weight of the Roman spear and then to be cut to pieces with the short , razor-sharp edge of the Roman sword . But here was the discipline of Rome and the power of Rome helpless within a circle of shouting , cursing , defiant and naked gladiators . " Rocks ! " cried Spartacus . " Rocks  --  the stones will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light on his toes , light in his motions , graceful . " Throw rocks ! " And under the shame of rocks , the soldiers went down . The air became full of flying stones . The women joined the circle  | the household slaves joined and the field slaves ran from the gardens to join . The soldiers shielded themselves under their huge targets , but that gave the gladiators a chance to run in , cut and run . One maniple charged the circle and hurled their spears . A single gladiator was caught by one of the terrible weapons , but the rest flung themselves on the maniple and dragged it down and slew the soldiers almost with bare hands . The soldiers fought back . Two maniples made a circle , and even when only a handful remained on their feet under the rain of stones , even when the gladiators poured onto them like a pack of wolves , they fought until they were dead . The fourth maniple tried to cut their way out of the circle and escape , but ten were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged down and slain , even as the trainers were slain  --  and two of the trainers , pleading for mercy , were killed by the women who beat them to death with rocks . The strange , violent little battle , which had started close to the mess hall , raged across the grounds of the school and onto the Capuan road , where the last soldier was dragged down and killed , and all over that space and distance lay dead men and wounded men , fifty-four dead who were Romans and trainers , and more who were gladiators . Yet it was only the beginning . Full of victory , blooded with it and exulting with it , it was only a beginning  --  and now as he stood on the highroad , Spartacus could see the walls of Capua in the distance , a misty golden city in the golden haze of the forenoon , and he could hear the beat of the garrison 's drums . Now there would be no rest , for things were happening and word was on the wind , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had exploded . He rode on currents mighty and tumultuous as he stood panting on the paved highroad with blood and death around him , and he saw Crixus , the red headed Gaul , laughing , Gannicus exultant , David the Jew with blood on his knife and life in his eyes ,  | and the huge Africans deliberately calm , murmuring their battle chant . He took Varinia in his arms then . And other gladiators were kissing their women , whirling them up in their arms and laughing with them , while house slaves came running with skins of Batiatus 's wine . Even the wounded made less of their wounds , and stifled their cries of pain . And the German girl looked at Spartacus , laughing and crying at once , and touched his face , his arms and the hand in which he held his knife . The wine sacks were being tilted when Spartacus brought them back to themselves . They could have stepped out of history then , drunken and exultant , for already the soldiers were beginning to march out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He ordered Gannicus to strip the dead soldiers of their arms , and he sent Nordo , an African , to see whether the armory could be broken into . His gentleness had gone now , and his single-minded intentness upon their escape burned like a bright flame and transformed him . All his life had been for this , and all his patience had been in preparation for this . He had waited for centuries ; he had waited since the first slave was shackled and whipped to hew wood and draw water , and he would not be turned from it now . Before , he had asked them ; now he commanded them . Who could use Roman arms ? Who had fought with the pilum ? He made a rank in four maniples . " I want the women inside , " he said . " They are not to be exposed . They are not to fight . " The fury of the women had surprised him . It was beyond and more than the fury of the men . The women wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight . They pleaded for some of the precious knives , and when he denied that , they belted their tunics and filled them with rocks to throw . Near the school were sloping , hilly fields of plantations . The  | field slaves , seeing that something was different and terrible ' and wild , ran to watch , gathered on the stone walls and in little a clumps here and there and , seeing them , the manner of his future , in all its simplicity , became plain to him . He called the Jew , David , and told him what to do , and the Jew ran toward the field slaves . Spartacus had not guessed wrong ; three quarters of the field slaves returned with David . They came running up and saluted the gladiators and kissed their hands . They carried with them their hoes , and all of a sudden their ; ; hoes were not tools but weapons . Now the Africans returned . ' They had not been able to break into the main armory ; it would take at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had broken open a newly arrived chest of tridents , the long , three-pointed fish forks . There were thirty of these three-pointed spears , and Spartacus distributed them among the retiari , and the Africans kissed the weapons , stroked them , and made their strange pledges upon them in their own strange tongues . All this had taken only a very short time , yet the need for haste weighed even more heavily upon Spartacus . He wanted to be away from the place , away from the school , away from Capua . " Follow me ! " he cried . " Follow me ! " Varinia stayed next to him . They went off the road and across the fields , mounting up onto the sloping hills . " Never leave me behind , never leave me behind , " said Varinia . " I can fight like a man can fight . " Now they saw the soldiers coming on the road from Capua . There were two hundred of the soldiers . They came on the double until they saw that the gladiators were taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tangent , so that they might cut off the gladiators , and the soldiers charged onto the fields . And beyond them , the citizens of Capua were pouring through the gates to watch this rising of slaves put down , to see a fighting of pairs without cost and without quarter .  | It could have ended here or an hour before or a month afterwards . At any one of an endless number of points , it could have ended . Slaves had run away before . If these slaves had run away , they would have gone into the fields and the woods ; they would have lived like animals on what they could steal and on the acorns from the ground . They would have been hunted down one by one , and they would have been crucified one by one . There was no sanctuary for a slave ; the world was made that way . And as Spartacus looked at the garrison soldiers , racing toward them , he knew this simple fact . There was no place to hide , no hole to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped running away , and he said , " We will fight the soldiers . " x Long afterwards , Spartacus asked himself , " Who will write of our battles and what we Won and what we lost ? And who will tell the truth ? " The truth of the slaves was contrary to all the truth of the times they lived in . The truth was impossible ? in every case the truth was impossible , not because it did not happen , but because there was no explanation for it within the context of those times . There were more soldiers than slaves , and the soldiers were heavily armed ; but the soldiers did not expect the slaves to fight and the slaves knew that the soldiers would fight . The slaves poured down on them from the slopes , and the soldiers , who were running in open order , the way men run after a flushed hare , could not meet the shock , flung their spears wildly , and cowered under the rain of stones the women showered upon them . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves and ran away from them , and halfway back to Capua the slaves pursued them and dragged them down . In the first battle , the slaves suffered sorely , but in the second battle only  | a handful of them died , and the Roman soldiers fled before them . This was the fact of the matter , but the tale was told in a hundred different ways , and the first report was that written out by the commander of the forces at Capua . " There was a rising of the slaves at the training school of Lentulus Batiatus , " he wrote , " and a number of them escaped and fled southward along the Appian Way . Half a cohort of garrison troops were sent out against them , but some of them managed to break through and escape . It is not known who their leaders are or what their intentions are , but already they have caused dissension among the slaves of the countryside , and it is felt by the citizens here that the noble Senate should spare no effort to reinforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put down promptly . " Possibly as an afterthought , the commander added , " A series of outrages have already taken place . It is feared that the countryside will suffer from looting and rapine . " And , of course , Batiatus told his story to crowds of Capuan citizens who were eager to hear it . No one was really disturbed  --  except Batiatus , who saw years of work go down the drain  --  but everyone realized that the countryside would be an uneasy place until the last of these terrible men ( the gladiators ) were run down and either slain or nailed upon a cross , so that others might profit by the example . The telling was a process ; the story was told and retold by hundreds of people whose whole lives were built on the uneasy structure of slaves , and they told the tale out of their fears and needs . Thus it has always been . Years later , it would be , " Yes , I happened to be taking the waters at Capua when Spartacus broke loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man . I saw him skewer a little child on his spear . It was a terrible thing to see . " Or any one of a thousand other versions . But the truth was something Spartacus himself only caught glimpses of at that  | time . His vision had broken loose from the fetters of his time . In two small engagements , the slaves he led had beaten Roman soldiers . It was quite true that these were only a handful of second-rate garrison troops , soft from easy living in a resort city , and they were opposed by the best professional swordsmen in all of Italy . But even with that factor considered , for the slave to strike down his master twice in a single day is an earth-shaking fact . Nor did they throw it away when the soldiers fled . They came back when Spartacus called them ? they were disciplined people , and already in a few hours , he was like a god to them . They were full of pride , and their fears had gone away . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a caressing of each other  --  as if the remorseless maxim , Gladiator , make no friends of gladiators , had suddenly reversed itself . And thereby , they were filled with an awareness of each other . They did not think this through or reason it out ; they were in great part simple and ignorant folk , but they had been suddenly exalted and purified . They looked at each other as if they had never seen each other before , and perhaps there was some truth in that . They had never really dared to look at each other before . Can the executioner look at his victim ? But now they were no longer victim and executioner in inevitable partnership ; now they were a brotherhood in triumph , and now Spartacus knew how it had happened in Sicily and in so many other places . He felt their strength because a part of it swelled up within himself , and this very current that coursed through him cleansed him of all the suffering that made up his past , all the fears and shames and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made an exact science of maintaining the life within him for so long , that one might readily have supposed that life would become a careful and cautious matter with him . But here was the sum of his savings , and he suddenly no longer feared death or thought of death because death was of no consequence . . .  | About five miles south of Capua , a little distance from the Appian Way , the gladiators and their women and the slaves who had joined them , gathered on a hillside within sight of one of the great manor houses which marked the plantation of some Roman gentleman . It was well onto midday now , and in the process of the two fights and the subsequent march southward , the gladiators had become a little army . From a distance , were it not for the black men among them , they might have been taken for a detachment of Roman soldiery . The weapons had been shared out among them , as had been the helmets and body armor and spears and shields of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tested as they were , it was doubtful whether any force closer than Rome could seriously challenge them . Aside from their women , but with the hand slaves and the field slaves who had joined them , they numbered two hundred and fifty men . Each of the three major groupings , the Gauls , the Africans and the Thracians , marched as a detachment  --  each with its own leading men as its nominal officers . Because for so long they had seen the Roman maniple of ten as a unit , they fell into it quite naturally . Spartacus led them . There was no discussion of that . They would have died for him . They were full of the legends of men who had been touched by the gods . When they looked at Spartacus , that belief was in their faces . While they marched , he was at their front , and the German girl , Varinia , walked beside him , her arm around his waist . Sometimes , she looked at him . This was not news to her . Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best and bravest of all men , and had n't she known that then  --  as well as she knew it now ? When their eyes met , she smiled at him . She had fought the soldiers . She did n't know whether he was pleased or not that she had fought the soldiers , but he made no objection to the knife she carried in her hand . They were equals . The world was full of old legends of the Amazons , the women who had gone onto the battlefield like men in the  | old , old days  --  and there were many other legends still current at the time of Spartacus of a past where all men and women too had been equals and there was neither master nor slave and all things had been held in common . That long ago was obscured by a haze of time ; it was the golden age . It would be the golden age again . It was a golden age now with the sun tipped over the lovely countryside and the fierce men of the arena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German slave girl , full of questions . The grass was soft and green in the meadow where they gathered . Yellow flowers topped it like butter , and everywhere butterflies and bees swarmed and the air was full of their song . They called him father in the Thracian way . " What will we do now and where will we go ? " He stood in the circle of them . Varinia sat in the grass , her cheek against his leg . They sat or crouched in the grass around him , the long-limbed black men , the Gauls with their ruddy faces and blue eyes , the Thracians with their dark hair and close-knit bodies . " We are a tribe , " he said . " Is that your will ? " They nodded at him . The tribe held no slaves and all men spoke equally , and it was not so long ago but that they remembered at least the memory . " Who will speak ? " he asked . " Who will come as your leader ? Stand up if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No one stood up . The Thracians beat their bucklers with the hilts of their knives , and the drumming roused a flight of thrushes from the meadow . Some people appeared in the distance around the manor house , but so far away that it was impossible to say who or what they were . The black men saluted Spartacus by clapping their hands in front of their faces . They were all strangely content , and for the moment they were living in a dream . Varinia 's cheek kept pressing against her man 's leg . Gannicus cried , " Hail , gladiator ! "  | A man who was dying stood up weakly . He had been stretched on the grass , his arm cut to the bone for all the length of it and the blood draining out of him . He was a Gaul and he did n't want to be left behind , and this way he had tasted freedom a little . His arm was bound around with blood-soaked cloth , and he walked over to Spartacus who helped him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said to the gladiators . " It is better than to die in the pairs . But I would rather follow this man than to die . I would rather follow this man and see where he leads us . But if I die , remember me and do him no wrong . Listen to him . The Thracians call him father , and we are like little children , but he will suck the evil out of us . There is no evil left in me . I did a great thing , and I am purified and I am not afraid to die . I will sleep quietly . I will dream no dreams after I am dead . " Some of the gladiators wept openly now . The Gaul kissed Spartacus , and Spartacus returned his kiss . " Stay by my side , " Spartacus said , and the man sank down on the grass next to him , and the field hands who had joined them stared open-mouthed at these gladiators who had such easy intimacy with death . " You die but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We will remember your name and shout it aloud . We will make a noise of it all over the land . " " You will never give up ? " the Gaul pleaded . " Did we give up when the soldiers came against us ? We fought the soldiers twice and we won . Do you know what we must do now ? " he asked the gladiators . They watched him . " Can we run away ? " " Where will we run ? " asked Crixus . " Everywhere , it is the same as here . Everywhere , it is master and slave . " " We will not run away , " said Spartacus , who knew now and  | surely and as certainly as if he had never had a doubt . " We will go from plantation to plantation , from house to house , and wherever we go , we will set the slaves free and add them to our numbers . When they send the soldiers against us again , we will fight them , and the gods will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " " And weapons ? Where will we find weapons ? " someone asked . " We will take them from the soldiers . And we will make them too . What is Rome but the blood and sweat and hurt of slaves ? Is there anything we can not make ? " " Then Rome will go to war against us . " " Then we will go to war against Rome , " said Spartacus quietly . " We will make an end of Rome , and we will make a world where there are no slaves and no masters . " It was a dream , but they were in a mood for dreaming . They had plunged into the skies , and if this strange Thracian with the black eyes and the broken nose had told them that he intended to lead them against the gods themselves , they would have believed at that moment and followed at that moment . " We will not dishonor ourselves , " Spartacus told them , speaking softly and directly and intently , speaking in a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do as the Romans do . We will not obey the Roman law . We will make our own law . " " What is our law ? " " Our law is simple . Whatever we take , we hold in common , and no man shall own anything but his weapons and his clothes . It will be the way it was in the old times . " A Thracian said , " There is enough for all to be rich . " " You make the law . I will not make it , " said Spartacus . So they talked , and there were greedy men among them who dreamed of being great lords , like the Romans , and  | there were others who dreamed of holding Romans as slaves ; so they talked and talked , but in the end it was as Spartacus had stated it . " And we will take no woman , except as wife , " said Spartacus . " Nor shall any man hold more than one wife . Justice will be equal between them , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no man may lie with any woman , Roman or otherwise , who is not his lawful wife . " Their laws were few , and they agreed upon their laws . Then they took up their arms and went against the manor house . Only the slaves remained , for the Romans had fled to Capua . . . And the slaves joined the gladiators . XI In Capua , they saw the smoke of the first manor house which burned , and thereby the slaves were vindictive and cruel . They would have wanted for the slaves to be gentle and understanding ; in more practical terms , they would have wanted the slaves to flee to the still-wild mountain heights , hiding singly or in handfuls in caves , living like animals until each was hunted down as an animal is hunted down . Even when the citizens of Capua saw the smoke of the first burning house , they were not unduly alarmed . It was to be expected that the gladiators would take out their bitterness on whatever they encountered . An express was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outbreak at Capua  --  and this meant that in a very few days , the situation would be under control . A lesson would be taught to slaves then that they would not easily forget . A large landowner , Marius Acanus by name , was forewarned , and gathered all his seven hundred slaves together to shepherd them to the safety of the walls of Capua ; but the gladiators met him on the road and stood in grim silence and watched as his own slaves slew him and his wife , and his  | wife 's sister , and his daughter and his daughter 's husband . It was a grim and awful business , but Spartacus knew that he could not stop it , nor was he particularly anxious to stop it . They had harvested only what they had sown , and the litter slaves themselves did the work , the moment they saw that these were not Roman soldiers but the very escaped gladiators whose fame was already running all over the place , a song and a scream on the wind itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown quicker than time . The original few hundred were more than a thousand , and as they marched south , slaves poured over the hills and across the valleys to join them . The field hands came with their tools of work ; the goatherds drove their herds of goats and sheep with them . When they approached a house , flowing toward it , a great , shapeless mass of folk  --  for only the gladiators still preserved a military formation of sorts  --  the news ran before them , and the kitchen slaves came out to greet them with their knives and cleavers , and the house slaves came running to give them gifts of silk and fine linen . In most cases , the Romans fled ; where the overseers and the Romans put up a fight , there was grisly evidence of work done . They could not move quickly . They had become too great a host of laughing , singing men and women and children , all of them drunk with the same wine of freedom . Darkness fell before they were twenty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bubbling stream , lighting fires , and eating their fill of fresh meat . Whole goats and sheep , and here and there even a bullock , went onto their spits , and the crisp , savory smell of roasting meat perfumed the air . It was a great feasting for folk who went from year 's end to year 's end on leeks and turnips and barley porridge . They washed down the meat with wine , and their songs and laughter spiced the food . What a company they were , Gauls and Jews and Greeks and Egyptians ,  | Thracians and Nubians and Sudanese and Lybians , Persians and Assyrians and Samarians , Germans and Slays , Bulgars and Macedonians and Spaniards and many an Italian too out of generations which had been sold into bondage for one reason or another , Sabines and Umbrians and Tuscans and Sicilians and folk of many other tribes whose very names are lost forever , a singular company of blood and nations but united first in their bondage and now in their freedom . In the old times , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribe  --  and ultimately the pride and privilege of the nation ; but for the world here was something new in this peculiar comradeship of the oppressed , and in all the great throng of so many nations and peoples that night , there was no voice raised in anger or discontent . They were touched with a little love and a little glory . Many of them had hardly seen Spartacus , or had him pointed out to them from a distance only , but they were full of Spartacus . He was their leader and their god  --  for it was not clear in their minds that gods did not walk the earth occasionally , and had n't Prometheus himself stolen the holy fire from heaven and given it as the most precious of all gifts to mankind ? And what had happened once could happen again . Already , tales were being told around their fires , and a whole Saga of Spartacus was coming into being . There was no one among them  --  no , not even among the little children  --  who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . And meanwhile Spartacus sat among the gladiators , and they talked and weighed the things that had happened . The little brook had become a river already and a torrent was in the making . Gannicus said it . His eyes shone whenever he looked at Spartacus . " We can march across the world and turn it over , stone by stone ! " This he said , but Spartacus knew better . He lay with his head in Varinia 's lap , and she passed her fingers through his tight brown curls and felt the stubble  | on his cheeks , and inside she was full of riches and contentment . Now she was satisfied , but a fire burned in him ; he had been more satisfied in slavery . He looked at the clear bright stars in the Italian night and he was filled with wild thoughts and yearning and fears and doubts and the weight of what he had to do lay upon him . He had to destroy Rome . The very thought , the insolent enormity of thinking this , made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers , singing to him in her own tongue , " When the hunter , from the forest , Brings the red deer from the hunting , Casts his eyes upon the fire , Speaks the children , speaks the woman ? " The rhythm of a forest folk in a cold and wild land . How many of her strange forest songs he had heard . She sang , and he repeated to himself , his thoughts laying themselves against the background of the music , his dreams spaced out among the shining stars in the sky , " You must destroy Rome  --  you , Spartacus . You must take these people away and be stern and strong with them . You must teach them to fight and kill . There is no going back ? not one single step back . The whole world belongs to Rome , so Rome must be destroyed and made only a bad memory , and then , where Rome was , we will build a new life where all men will live in peace and brotherhood and love , no slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a time like the old times , like the golden age . We will build new cities of brotherhood , and there will be no walls around them . " Then Varinia stopped singing and asked him . " What are you dreaming , my man , my Thracian ? Are the gods in the stars talking to you ? Then what are they telling you , my beloved ? Are they telling you secret things that are never to be shared ? " She half believed this . Who knew what was true and what was untrue concerning the gods ? Spartacus hated the gods and gave them no worship . " Are there gods for slaves ? " he had once asked her .  | " In all my life , " he said to her , " there will be nothing I wo n't share with you , my beloved . " " Then what are you dreaming ? " " I am dreaming that we will make a new world . " Then she was afraid of him , but he said to her , gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just happen , my darling ? Think . Is there anything in it that we did not build , the cities , the towers , the walls , the roads and the ships ? Then why ca n't we make a new world ? " " Rome ? " she said , and in the single word there was the power implicit , the power that ruled the world . " Then we will destroy Rome , " answered Spartacus . " The world has had its belly full of Rome . We will destroy Rome and we will destroy what Rome believes in . " " Who ? Who ? " she pleaded . " The slaves . There have been risings of slaves before , but it will be different now . We will send out a call that slaves will hear across the world . . . " So peace went and hope went , and long afterwards , Varinia recalled that night when her man 's head was in her lap and his eyes were fixed on the far off stars . Yet it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few such nights , and then they are fortunate . They lay there , among the gladiators , alongside the fire , and time went slowly . They touched each other and proved their awareness of each other . They became like one person .  | deleted page  | leader of the famous Caelian Ward at the age of thirty . Five years later he was a magistrate , and at the age of forty he entered the Senate . He knew ten thousand people in the city by name and twenty thousand more by sight . He included in his list of favors even his worst enemies , and while he never made the mistake of believing that any of his associates were honest , he never fell into the more profound error of taking for granted the dishonesty of any one of them . His weight and substance befitted his position ; he had never trusted women nor had he noticed that they were particularly profitable to his colleagues . His own vice was food , and the huge layers of fat which he had accumulated over the span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of a man , but made him one of those few Romans who were never seen in public but that they were wrapped in the folds of a toga . In a tunic , Lentelus Gracchus was not an ingratiating figure of a man . In a toga , he was a symbol of Roman substance and virtue . His three hundred pounds of weight supported a bald , jowled head , firmly set in rings of fat . He had a deep , hoarse voice , a winning smile , and small , cheerful blue eyes which peered out of folds of flesh . And his skin was pink as a baby 's . Gracchus was less cynical than informed . The formula of Roman power had never been a mystery to him , and he was rather amused by Cicero 's ponderous advance toward what Cicero liked to think was the last and most important truth . When Antonius Caius asked him his opinion of Cicero , Gracchus replied shortly , " A young fogey . " With Antonius Caius , Gracchus was on the best of terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one mystery and shrine he permitted himself . He liked aristocrats . He envied them . He also , within a certain area , despised them , for he considered all of them rather stupid , and he never got  | over the fact that they seemed to derive so little advantage from birth and station . Nevertheless , he cultivated them , and it gave him a feeling of pride and pleasure to be invited to one of their splendid plantations , such as the Villa Salaria . He did not put on airs and he made no attempt to pass as an aristocrat . He did not speak their clipped , genteel Latin , but rather the easy language of the plebs . Though he could well afford it , he made no attempt to set up a plantation of his own . For their part , they appreciated his practicality and fund of useful information ; and his immense size communicated assurance . Antonius Caius liked him because Gracchus was a man utterly unmoved by moral judgment , and he often referred to Gracchus as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evening , Gracchus missed little of what went on . He weighed and assessed , but he did not judge . For Caius , he had nothing but contempt .

I think he would cut his mother 's throat if it advanced the cause of Cicero . " " But the cause of Cicero is not that important . " " Precisely . And therefore he will fail at practically everything . He is nobody to fear since he is nobody to admire . " That was a most penetrating comment to make to Antonius Caius , who was someone to admire , even though his sexual tendencies and practices were pitched at the level of a twelve year old . Gracchus was willing to admit to himself that the ground he stood upon was turning to slime . His world was disintegrating , but since the process of disintegration was exceedingly slow and since he himself was far from immortal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see what went on without taking sides ; there was no necessity in his makeup for him to take sides . On this particular evening , he remained awake after the  | rest of the household had gone to sleep . He slept little and poorly , and now he took a turn around the grounds in the bright moonlight . If anyone had asked him , he would have been able to report fairly accurately on how partners had been chosen for bed that evening ; but he had observed this without prying , and he felt no resentment . This was Rome . Only a fool considered otherwise . As he walked , he saw Julia sitting on a stone bench , a mournful figure in the night , dispossessed and stricken with terror at her own inadequacy and by the manner of her rejection . He turned toward her . " Two of us for the night , " he said to her . " It is a most beautiful night , is n't it , Julia ? " " If you feel beautiful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged his toga . " Would you like me to sit for a while ? " " Please do . " He sat in silence for a little , mildly responsive to the moonlit beauty of the grounds , the great white house rising so finely out of its bed of shrubs and evergreens , the terrace , the fountains , the pale gleam of sculpture here and there , the arbors with their lovely benches of pale pink or deep black marble . How much beauty Rome had managed ! Finally , he said , " It would seem , Julia , that this should content us . " " Yes , it would seem so . " He was her husband 's friend and guest . " A privilege to be a Roman , " he remarked . " You never make these stupid platitudes ' except when you are with me , " Julia answered quietly . " Yes ? " " Yes , I think so . Tell me , did you ever hear of Varinia ? " " Varinia ? " " Do you ever commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind at least five times ? I 'm not trying to be clever , my dear . " She rested her hand on his great paw . " I ca n't be . Varinia was the wife of Spartacus . " " Yes , I have heard of her . As a matter of fact , you people out here are obsessed with Spartacus . I 've heard of little else tonight . " " Well , he spared the Villa Salaria . I do n't know whether to be grateful or not . I suppose it 's the tokens of punishment . I have n't been out to the road yet . Are they very terrible ? " " Terrible ? I do n't know that I gave it much thought . There they are , and that 's about all . Life is cheap , and slaves are worth just about nothing these days . Why did you ask me about Varinia ? " " I 've been trying to think of whom I envy . I think I envy her . " " Really , Julia ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her picked up at the market tomorrow and sent here ? " " You 're never serious about anything , are you , Gracchus ? " " Very little worth being serious about . Why do you envy her ? " " Because I hate myself . " " That 's too complex for me , " Gracchus rumbled . " Can you see her , dirty , picking her nose , hawking , spitting , her nails broken and unclean , her face covered with pimples ? That 's your slave princess . Do you still envy her ? " " Was she like that ? " Gracchus laughed . " Who knows ! Julia , politics is a lie . History is the recording of a lie . If you go down to the road tomorrow and look at the crosses , you will see the only truth about Spartacus . Death . Nothing else . Everything else is sheer fabrication . I know . " " I look at my slaves ? " " And you do n't see Spartacus ? Of course . Stop eating your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I take the privilege of advice . Yes , at the risk of intruding where I 've no business to go . Take a young buck out of your slave quarters ? " " Stop it , Gracchus ! " " ? and he might be Spartacus for all that . " She was crying now . Gracchus did not see many women of his class in tears , and he felt suddenly awkward and stupid . He began to ask her whether it was his fault . Nothing he had said was particularly insulting ; but was it his fault ? " No , no , please , Gracchus . You 're one of the only friends I have . Do n't stop being my friend because I 'm such a fool . " She dried her eyes , excused herself , and left him there . " I 'm very tired , " she said . " Please do n't come with me . " Like Cicero , Gracchus had a sense of history ; the important difference was that Gracchus never confused himself concerning his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more clearly than Cicero did . He sat now all alone in the warm and gentle Italian night and turned over in his mind the strange case of a Roman matron and patrician who envied a barbarian slave woman . First , he considered whether Julia was telling the truth . He decided that she was . For some reason , the essence of Julia 's own pitiful tragedy was spotlighted by Varinia  --  and he wondered whether in the same way the meaning of their own lives was not contained in the endless tokens of punishment which lined the Appian Way . Gracchus was not troubled by morality ; he knew his own people , and he was not taken in by the legendry of the Roman matron and the Roman family . But for some strange reason , he was most deeply troubled by what Julia had said , and the question would not leave him . The answer was in a flash of understanding which left him cold and shaken in a way he had rarely been shaken before ;  | and it left him full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and non-existence which death brings ; for the answer took away a great deal of the cynical certainty which supported him and left him sitting there on the stone bench bereft , a fat and paunchy old man whose personal doom had suddenly become linked with an enormous movement of the currents of history . He saw it clearly . The thing which had come into the world so newly was a whole society built upon the backs of slaves , and the symphonic utterance of that society was the song of the whip-lash . What did it do to the people who wielded the whip ? What did Julia mean ? He had never married ; a germ of this present understanding had kept him from ever taking a wife , so he bought women and the concubines in his house were there when he needed them . But Antonius Caius also kept a stable of concubines , even as every gentleman he knew kept a quantity of women as one keeps a quantity of horses or dogs , and the wives knew and accepted and equalized matters with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption , but a monster which had turned the world over ; and these people , gathered together for a night at the Villa Salaria , were obsessed with Spartacus because Spartacus was all that they were not . Cicero might never understand whence came the virtue of this mysterious slave , but he , Gracchus , he understood . Home and family and honor and virtue and all that was good and noble was defended by the slaves and owned by the slaves  --  not because they were good and noble , but because their masters had turned over to them all that was sacred . As Spartacus had a vision of what might be  --  the vision arising out of himself  --  so did Gracchus have his own vision of what might be , and what he saw in the future made him cold and sick and afraid . He rose and gathered his toga about him , and plodded with heavy steps toward his room and bed .  | But he could not sleep easily . He took up Julia 's wish , and like a little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his loneliness , and like a little boy , he pretended that the slave girl Varinia shared his bed with him . Terror gave force to his plaintive desire for virtue . His fat , ringed hands stroked a ghost on his bedsheet . The hours passed , and he lay there with his memories . They all hated Spartacus . This house was filled with Spartacus ; no one knew his form or shape or thoughts or manner , but this house was filled with his presence and Rome was filled with his presence . It was a complete fiction that he , Gracchus , was free from that hatred . Quite to the contrary , his hatred , which he had always so carefully concealed , was more violent , more bitter , more poignant than their hatred . As he struggled with his memories , his memories took shape and form and color and reality . He remembered how he was sitting in the Senate  --  and he never sat in the Senate chamber but that he felt and resented his own pride at being there among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post from Capua that there had been an uprising among the gladiators at the school of Lentulus Batiatus and that it was spreading over the countryside . He remembered the wave of fear that spread through the Senate , and how they began to cackle like a great flock of geese , all of them talking at once , all of them saying wild , frightened things simply because a handful of gladiators had killed their trainers . He remembered his disgust with them . He remembered how he rose , gathering his toga together and throwing it over his shoulder with the sweeping gesture which had become a hallmark of his , and thundering at his august colleagues , " Gentlemen  --  gentlemen , you forget yourselves ! " They stopped their cackling and turned to him . " Gentlemen , we are faced with the crime of a handful of  | miserable , dirty butcher slaves . We are not faced with a barbarian invasion . But even if we were , gentlemen , it would seem to me that the Senate might comport itself somewhat differently ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity ! " They were enraged with him , but he was enraged with them . He made it a point of pride never to lose his temper , but this was one time he had , and he , a person of low birth and breeding , a commoner , had insulted and humbled the most august body in the whole world . " The devil with that ! " he said to himself , and he stalked out of the chamber with their pious defense of their dignity ringing in his ears , and he went home . That day lived with him . Every minute of that day lived with him . He had been frightened at first . He had violated his own sacred rules of conduct . He had lost his temper . He had made enemies . He walked through the streets of his beloved Rome , and he was full of fears at what he had done . But the fear was mingled with contempt for his colleagues and contempt for himself , in that he could not even now overcome his awe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied its seats . For once , he was blind to the smell and the sound and the sight of his beloved Rome . Gracchus was city born and bred , and the urbs was his habitat . It was part of him and he was part of it , and he nursed a consummate contempt for far horizons and green valleys and babbling brooks . He had learned to walk and run and fight in the twisting alleys and dirty gutters of Rome . He had scrambled like a goat in his childhood over the tall roofs of the endless tenement houses . The smell of charcoal fires , which pervaded the city , was the sweetest perfume he knew . This was one area in his life where cynicism never conquered . To go through the narrow market streets , with their rows of pushcarts and stalls , where  | the merchandise of the whole world was displayed and sold , was always a new adventure for him . Half the city knew him by sight . It was " Ho , Gracchusl " here , and " Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , and the venders and cobblers and beggars and loafers and draymen and masons and carpenters liked him because he was one of them and had fought and clawed his way up to the top . They liked him because when he bought votes , he paid the highest price . They liked him because he put on no airs and because he preferred to walk rather than ride in a litter and because he always had time to greet an old friend . That he offered no cure for their increasing misery and hopelessness in a world where slaves were driving them to become loafers and beggars who lived on the dole of the state , made little difference . They knew of no cure . And he , in turn , loved their world , the world of gloom where the towering tenements almost met over the dirty alleys and had to be propped apart with timbers , the world of the streets , the noisy , dirty , wretched streets of the world 's greatest city . But on this day which he remembered so vividly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked through the streets without heeding the greetings . He bought nothing at the stalls . Even the tasty morsels of fried bacon , stuffed derma and smoked sausage which cooked on so many pushcarts did not attract him . Usually he could not resist the street cooking , the honey cakes and smoked fish and dried salted sardines and pickled apples and cured roe ; but on this day he was unaware of it  --  and sunk in his own gloom , he returned to his home . Gracchus , who was almost as wealthy as Crassus , never permitted himself to build or purchase one of the private villas which were going up in the new part of the city , among the gardens and parks along the river . He preferred to occupy the ground floor of a tenement in his old ward , and his doors  | were always open to those who desired to see him . It must be remarked that many well-to-do families lived in these ground floors . They were the choice tenement dwellings , and in a Roman tenement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rickety stairs that led to the upper stories . Uusually it was only the two lowest floors which had water piped in and any toilet or bathing facilities to speak of ; but the old tribal commune was not so far in the past that an absolute separation of rich and poor had been achieved everywhere , and many a wealthy merchant or banker had a veritable nest of poverty towering for seven stories over his head . So Gracchus remembered how he had come back to his home that day with never a word of cheer or greeting for anyone , and how he had gone into his office , giving his slaves the rather unusual request that he be left alone . His slaves were all women ; that he insisted upon and would have no man share his quarters with him ; nor did he overdo it , as so many of his friends did . Fourteen women did for all of his needs . He kept no special harem , as bachelors frequently did ; he used those of his slave women who attracted him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he desired no complications in his home , whenever one of his women became pregnant , he sold her to a plantation owner . He reasoned that it was better for children to grow up in the country , and he saw nothing either immoral or cruel in his procedure . He had no favorites among his women  --  since he never was capable of anything more than the most casual relationship with any woman  --  and he was fond of saying that his was a better ordered and more peaceful household than most . But now , as he lay in bed at the Villa Salaria and recalled that day , his memories of his household had no joy or warmth . A moral measure had taken hold of him , and it sickened him  | to think of how he lived . Yet he pursued the incidents of that day . He saw himself from a vantage point , a fat , gross man in a toga sitting all alone in the bare room he called his office , and he must have sat there for better than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door . " What is it ? " he asked . " There are some gentlemen to see you , " the slave said . " I do n't want to see anyone . " How childish he was being ! " These are fathers and honorable persons from the Senate . " So they had come to him , and he was not lost and cast out of their circle . What had made him think that he would be ? Of course , they would come to him ! He lived again . His ego returned . He sprang up and threw open the door , and he was the old Gracchus , smiling , assured , competent . " Gentlemen , " he said . " Gentlemen , I bid you welcome . " There were five in the committee . Two of them were consulares ; the other three were patricians of distinction and shrewdness . The committee had come less in terms of the present emergency than to re-cement whatever political breaks Gracchus might be in the process of making . So they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gracchus ? Have you been sitting there this whole year waiting for an opportunity to insult us ? " " I have neither the wit nor the grace to beg your pardon properly , " Gracchus apologized . " You have both . But that is beside the point . " He called for chairs , and they seated themselves in a circle around him , five men of age and dignity , wrapped in the fine white togas which had become the symbol of Roman rule the world over . He had wine brought and a tray of sweets . The consularis Caspius became the spokesman . He flattered Gracchus and puzzled him , for Gracchus did not see the occasion as being one of such monumental crisis . He had often dreamed of playing the part of consul , but that was not his  | dish and he had none of the talents or particular family connections required . He tried to guess what they were after , and could only presume that it was connected with Spain , where the revolt against the Senate  --  and Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a contest for power between Sertorius and Pompey . Gracchus had his own estimation of this . He despised both the rivals , and was determined to sit by and allow them to destroy each other . As were , he knew , the five gentlemen who faced him . " You see then , " said Caspius , " that this revolt in Capua has enormous implications of danger . " " I do n't see that at all , " answered Gracchus flatly . " Taking into consideration what we have suffered from slave revolts ? " " What do you know about this revolt ? " asked Gracchus , more gently now than before . " How many slaves are there involved ? Who are they ? Where have they gone ? How real is your worry ? " Caspius answered the questions one by one . " We have maintained constant communication . Initially , only the gladiators were involved . There is one report that only seventy escaped . A later report has it that over two hundred escaped , Thracians and Gauls and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . This may be the result of panic . On the other hand , there may have been disturbances on the latifundia . They seem to have been responsible for considerable damage , but no details are available . As to where they have gone , it would seem that they are moving in the direction of Mount Vesuvius . " " Nothing more than it would seem , " snapped Gracchus impatiently . " Are they idiots at Capua that they ca n't assess what has happened in their own courtyard ? They have a garrison there . Why did n't the garrison put an end to this thing quickly and expeditiously ? "  | Caspius looked coolly at Gracchus . " They had only one cohort at Capua . ' ' " One cohort ! How many troops do you need to pull down a few wretched gladiators ? " " You know as well as I do what must have happened at Capua . " " I do n't know , but I can guess . And my guess would be that the garrison commander is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twenty soldiers here , a dozen there . How many were left in the city ? " " Two hundred and fifty . There it is . No need for righteousness , Gracchus . The troops were defeated by the gladiators . That is what is so worrisome , Gracchus . Our feeling is that the City Cohorts should be dispatched immediately . " " How many ? " " At least six cohorts  --  at least three thousand men . " " When ? " " Immediately . " Gracchus shook his head . This was precisely what he might have expected . He thought of what he intended to say . He thought it over very carefully . He gathered in his mind all that he knew and had known of slave psychology . " Do n't do it . " He had a habit of opposing them . They all demanded to know why . " Because I do n't trust city cohorts . Leave the slaves alone for the time being . Let a little rot start in them . Do n't send city cohorts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the legions . " " From Spain . And Pompey ? " " Let Pompey rot and be damned ! All right  --  leave Spain alone . Bring the Third down from Cisalpine Gaul . Do n't rush . These are slaves , a handful of slaves . It will not be anything unless you make it something ... "  | So they argued , and in his memory , Gracchus lived the argument again and lost again and saw them , in their incredible fear of slave revolt , determine to send six of the City Cohorts . Gracchus slept just a little . He woke at the break of dawn , as he always did , regardless of time and place . IIe took his morning water and fruit to the terrace to eat . Daylight eases the fears and the perplexities of man , and most often it is like a balm and a benediction . Most often , but not always ; for there are certain categories of human beings who do not welcome the light of day . A prisoner hugs the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort him , and daylight brings no cheer to a condemned man . But most often , daylight washes out the confusions of the night . Great men assume the mantle of their greatness anew each morning , for even great men become like all other men in the night time , and some of them do despicable things and others of them weep and still others huddle in fear of death and of a darkness deeper than that which surrounds them . But in the morning they are great men again , and Gracchus , sitting on the terrace , mantled in a fresh snow-white toga , his big fleshy face cheerful and confident , was a picture of what a Roman senator should be . It has been said many times , then and later , that no finer and nobler and wiser body of men ever came together for legislative debate than the Senate of Republican Rome , and looking at Gracchus , one was inclined to accept this . It was true that he was not nobly born and that the blood in his veins was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was a virtue of the Republic that a man was measured in terms of himself as much as in terms of his ancestors . The very fact that the gods gave a man wealth was an indication of his inborn qualities , and if one wanted proof of this , one had only to see how many were poor and how few were rich .  | As Gracchus sat there , he was joined by the others of the company which graced the Villa Salaria . It was an extraordinary group of men and women who had gathered there for the night , and they enjoyed the knowledge that they were remarkable and very important persons . It put them at ease with each other , and it underlined their trust in Antonius Caius , who never made the mistake of mixing people improperly at his plantation . But in general terms of Roman country life , they were not too unusual . It is true that among them were two of the richest people in the world , a young woman who would become a remarkable whore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of calculated and cold intrigue and plotting would remain famous for many centuries to come , and another young man whose degeneracy would become a matter of fame in itself ; but at almost any time , similar folk would be found at the Villa Salaria . This morning , they grouped themselves around Gracchus . He was the only one among them who wore a toga . He was the immovable senior magistrate , sitting there with his scented water , peeling an apple , and granting a word here or there . " They recover well , " he said to himself , looking at the well groomed men and the carefully painted women , their hair done expertly and beautifully , their lipstick and rouge so artfully placed . They made conversation about this thing and that thing , and their conversation was clever and wellrehearsed . If they spoke about sculpture , Cicero took an official position , as might be expected : " I am tired of all this talk of the Greeks . What have they done that the Egyptians did not achieve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular degeneracy , a people unfit for growth or command . Which their sculpture reflects . At least a Roman artist portrays what is . " " But what is can be very boring , " Helena protested , the prerogative of youth and an intellectual and a woman . It was  | expected of Gracchus that he should deny knowing anything at all about art . However , " I know what I like . " Gracchus knew a good deal about art . He bought Egyptian art , because it struck some chord in him . Crassus had no strong opinions about art ; it was remarkable how few strong opinions he had , yet he was a good general as such things went . At the same time , he resented Cicero 's cocksure statement . It was all very well to talk about degeneracy when you did n't have to fight the so-called degenerates . " I must say I favor Greek sculpture , " Antonius Caius remarked . " It 's cheap , and it 's very pleasing once the color washes off . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one finds around , but they look well in a garden and I prefer them that way . " " Then you might have bought the monuments of Spartacus ? before our friend Crassus had them smashed to pieces , " Cicero smiled . " Monuments ? " asked Helena . " They had to be smashed , " Crassus said cooly . " What monuments ? " " If I 'm not mistaken , " Cicero said , " it was Gracchus who signed the order for their destruction . " " You 're never mistaken , are you , young man ? " Gracchus rumbled . " You 're quite right . " He explained to Helena , " There were two great monuments carved out of volcanic stone that Spartacus raised up on the eastern slope of Vesuvius . I never saw them , but I signed the order for their destruction . " " How could you ? " Helena demanded . " How could I not ? If filth raises an emblem of filth , you wash it out ! " " What were they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling ruefully at the manner in which the ghosts of the slaves and the ghost of their  | leader intruded , no matter where the conversation began . " I never saw them , my dear . Crassus did . Ask him . " " I ca n't give you an artist 's opinion , " Crassus said . " But these things looked like what they were supposed to be . There were two of them . One was the figure of a slave , about fifty feet tall , I 'd say . He stood with his feet apart and he had burst his chains , so that they hung loose about him . With one arm , he clasped a child to his breast , and in the other hand , hanging loose , there was a Spanish sword . That was one , and you might call it a colossus , I suppose . It was very well done as far as I could see , but as I said , I 'm no judge of art . But it was plainly done , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details as the calluses and sores the chains would naturally raise . I remember young Gaius Taneria pointing out to me the heavy shoulder development of the slave and the raised veins in the hands , just as you would see in any ploughman . You know , Spartacus had a good many Greeks with him , and the Greeks are very clever at this kind of thing . They never had an opportunity to paint it , or perhaps they could n't get any pigment , and all in all it reminded me of some of the old carvings you see in Athens , the ones where the paint has washed off , and I agree with Caius that they 're pleasing that way  --  and very cheap too . " The other monument was not as tall ; the figures were no more than twenty feet high , but they were also well done . There were three gladiators , a Thracian , a Gaul and an African . The African , interestingly enough , was carved out of black stone ; the other figures were white . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , grasping his trident in both hands . On one side of him stood the Thracian , knife in hand , and on the other side , the Gaul , sword in hand . It was well done , and you could see that they had been fighting , for they were badly cut about the arms and legs . Behind them , a woman stood  --  and very proudly , and they say Varinia  | was the original of that . The woman held a trowel in one hand and a mattock in the other . I must confess , I never quite understood the significance of that . " " Varinia ? " Gracchus asked softly . " Why did you have to destroy them ? " Helena asked . " Could you leave their monuments standing ? " countered Gracchus . " Could you leave it there , for all to point to and say , Here is what slaves did ? " " Rome is strong enough to afford to leave them  --  yes , and point to them , " Helena declared . " Nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it had been then , with ten thousand of his best troops lying in a bloody field , and the slaves moving away like an angry lion that is only annoyed but hardly hurt . " What did the sculpture of Varinia look like ? " Gracchus asked , trying to make the question seem as casual as possible . " I do n't know that I can recall it very well . You would take her for a German or Gaulish woman , long hair , loose gown and all that . The hair in braids and bound the way the Germans and Gauls do it . A good bust  --  a fine , strong figure of a woman , like some of those German wenches you see in the market today , and everyone so eager to buy them . Of course , one does n't know whether it actually was Varinia or not . Like everything else in the Spartacus business , we know almost nothing about it . Unless you want to swallow the propaganda whole and let it go at that . All I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , told me , and that was precious little , except that his tongue was out and he slobbered over the memory of her . So she must have been attractive ? " " And you destroyed that too ! " Helena declared . Crassus nodded . He was not a man easily disturbed . " My dear , " he said to Helena , " I was a soldier and I carried out the instructions of the Senate . You will hear it said that the Servile War was a small thing . It 's quite natural that such a  | view should be taken , since it profits Rome little to tell the world what a job we had with some slaves . But here , on this pleasant terrace at the home of my dear and good friend , Antonius Caius , with the company we have , we can dispense with legends . No one ever came as close to destroying Rome as Spartacus did . No one ever wounded her so terribly . I do n't want to build up my own case . Let Pompey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in putting down slaves . But the truth remains , and if the tokens of punishment are unpleasant , think of how I felt when I saw the ground carpeted with the bodies of the finest troops in Rome . So I did n't shrink from destroying some rock carving that the slaves had made . Quite to the contrary , I took a certain satisfaction in it . We destroyed the images most thoroughly and ground them into rubble  --  so that no trace of it remains . So did we destroy Spartacus and his army . So will we in time  --  and necessarily ? destroy the very memory of what he did and how he did it . I am a fairly simple man and not particularly clever , but I know this . The order of things is that some must rule and some must serve . So the gods ordained it . So it will be . " It was a quality of Crassus that he could evoke passion without being in the slightest degree passionate himself . His fine , strong military features gave emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so completely the bronze hawk of the Republic ! Gracchus watched him from under dropped lids . Gracchus sat there and watched each of them , the thin-faced , predatory Cicero , the young fop , Caius , Helena , the silent , suffering and somewhat ridiculous Julia , Claudia , sleek and satisfied , Antonius Caius  --  and Crassus  --  all of them , he watched , and he listened too , and he thought again of how the Senatorial Committee had come after him when he stalked away . That was the beginning , of course  --  when the six cohorts were sent . And the beginning would be forgotten , and the end too , as  | Crassus said . Unless  --  as it might be  --  the end was still to come . Iv In the beginning , the decision of the Senate was to send six of the City Cohorts to Capua immediately to put down the revolt of the slaves . This was the decision which Gracchus had opposed , and which was , in some measure , carried through to teach him elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of humility was recalled by Gracchus with certain bitter satisfaction . Each of the City Cohorts consisted of five hundred and sixty soldiers  --  who were armed as the average legionary was , only better and more expensively . The city was a good place to be . The legions went to the ends of the earth , and often enough they never returned but found their graves in foreign soil , and often enough they returned five or ten or fifteen years later . The legions marched all day on a handful of meal , and sweated and worked , built roads and cities in the wilderness , and sometimes the great urbs became only a memory to them . The City Cohorts lived on the fat of the land , and for them there was no end of girls , wine , and games . Even a common soldier in a City Cohort was a political factor , and a trickle of money always tickled his palm . Many of these men had good off-duty flats in the city , and some of them supported as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city soldier who kept fourteen concubines in a large apartment in Rome and made a profitable business out of raising children to the age of six and then selling them in the public market . Many similar stories were told . They wore handsome uniforms . All of the cohorts were commanded by young men of good families who were making careers out of the army , but desired their careers within walking distance of the theatre , the arena and the better  | restaurants . Half of them were friends of Caius , and once or twice he had even toyed with the notion of taking such an appointment himself , but had abandoned the idea as being apart from his peculiar talents . But this kind of command and also the fact that the cohorts were called upon to perform ceremonial parade duty at almost every public function , led to a natural rivalry among the young gentlemen to lead the best uniformed contingent . In the city , the dirty , sweatsoaked leather trousers of the legionary was replaced by softly-tanned and beautifully-dyed doeskin . Each regiment sported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the helmets was generally given . The humeralia , the iron shoulder strips which came down in front and lapped over the breast-plate , were frequently plated with gold or silver . One cohort was armored entirely in brass , and each regiment had a distinctive boot , often knee-high and ornamented with tiny silver bells . Bronze greaves , long since discarded by the frontier legions who found marching miles a day impossible to men whose legs were encased in metal , were still sported by half of the city regiments , and each cohort had a different design for the face of its shields . The quality of their arms and armor was unmatched in all Italy . It was not that they were poorly trained . The cohorts went through their paces every day in this period . They trained , usually in the early morning , in the Circus Maximus , which was then an open race course in the depression of the Vallis Murcia , and it was a pleasure to see them go through their movements to the cadenced music of one hundred fifes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be covered with the children of Rome , who watched the military spectacle with delight and envy . But the fact of the matter was that the cohorts were not legions , and it 's one thing to put down a mob of desperate and hungry unemployed or to fight through a political squab-  | ble in the narrow city streets , and quite another to go up against Spaniards or Gauls or Germans or Thracians or Jews or Africans . Yet this was no more than an uprising of a handful of slaves , and for all their failings , six of the City Cohorts included better than three and a half thousand Roman soldiers . Even Gracchus granted that in part . He did not , as a matter of principle , like to see the cohorts go more than a day 's march from the city walls . But there were twenty-seven cohorts in all , and even Gracchus granted that they could do what they had to do . His opposition stemmed more from a deep-seated fear of these political regiments which consisted not of peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workless , conscienceless , corrupted parasites of Rome , the castoff and the hopeless who lived their lives in the limbo between the mass of the slaves upon which the society rested and the handful of rulers above . They outnumbered the working people of Rome , the dwindling core of artisans and shopkeepers . They spent their days in the streets or in the arena ; they lived on their dole and gambled and bet on the races and sold their votes at each election and strangled their new-born children to escape the responsibility of raising them and spent hours at the baths and lived in the dirty little flats in the towering tenements  --  and from them were recruited the City Cohorts . The six cohorts left at the break of dawn , on the day following the decision of the Senate . Their command was given to a young senator , Varinius Glabrus , who was given the token of legate and dispatched as a direct deputy of the Senate . There was no shortage of older men with years of military experience in Rome ; but Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and the Senate was exceedingly wary about giving military power into the hands of anyone outside their body . Varinius Glabrus was vain , rather stupid , and politically dependable.  | He was thirty-nine years old at the time , and through his mother , he had excellent family connections . He was not unduly ambitious , and both he and his family welcomed the assignment as an opportunity for considerable glory with no uncertainty attached . In selecting him , the Senate majority was strengthening its position with a whole section of the patrician population . The officers under him would do what had to be done in a military way ; as to the few decisions he had to make , careful and explicit instructions were given him . He was to lead his men to Capua at field pace , which meant twenty miles a day . All of this distance was along the Appian Way , which meant that wagons would take care of food and water which the ordinary legionary had to carry on his back . He was to bivouac his men outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day in that city receiving intelligence on the progress of the slave revolt and making his plans to suppress it . After that , he was to report his plans to the Senate , but proceed with his plans without waiting for confirmation . He was to deal with the slaves as he found necessary , but was to make every effort to capture the leaders of the revolt , and to return them and as many more as could be taken , to Rome for public trial and punishment . If the council at Capua should request tokens of punishment , he was given the right to crucify ten slaves outside Capua  --  but only if that represented less than half of those taken prisoner . By explicit order of the Senate , all property rights in the slaves were forfeit to the Senate , and Varinius was instructed that no claims upon them should be honored , although writs for subsequent suits could be accepted and delivered to the Committee for Claims . This was before there was any indication at Rome of who led the revolt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it clearly understood how the revolt at the school of Batiatus had come about . The City Cohorts assembled for  | parade at the break of dawn , but there was some delay in terms of a dispute among the officers for position of the cohorts . The sun was well up in the sky when they began to march . The stirring military music of their drums and fifes sounded through the city , and when they reached the gates there was quite a crowd assembled to see them go . Gracchus remembered that very well  --  well indeed . He and two other senators joined the crowd at the gates , and he recalled what a fine sight it was as the cohorts marched out , the band playing , the banners flying , the standards swaying so proudly , the plumed helmets of the soldiers nodding as they marched , and Varinius at the head of the column , wearing a burnished brass breast-plate , riding a fine white horse , and waving to the crowds who cheered him . There 's nothing in the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it well indeed . v So the Senate learned the name of Spartacus , and Gracchus could recall the first time he heard the name spoken . Possibly , that was the first time it was spoken aloud at Rome . Unobtrusively , without particular importance or note , it was commented upon by Varinius in the report which he sent by fast post from Capua to the Senate in Rome . The report of Varinius was not a specially inspiring document . It began with the customary , " May it please the noble Senate , " and then it went on to detail the few incidents of the march along the Appian Way and the intelligence which had been gathered at Capua . The main feature of the march was that the three cohorts who wore bronze greaves developed painful sores on the instep . Varinius had decided that they should abandon their greaves and have one of the wagons take the armor back to Rome . The officers of the cohorts concerned felt that this was a reflection upon their regimental honor , that their men were  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved with a little foot-grease . Varinius gave in to them , and as a result , over a hundred men would have to be left at Capua as unfit for duty . Several hundred others were limping , but it was felt that they would be fit enough to participate in the campaign against the slaves . ( Gracchus winced when he heard the word campaign used . ) As to the revolt , Varinius was obviously torn between a desire to report the facts  --  which made little of it  --  and the opportunity for self-advancement , which would mean making a good deal of it . He inserted a statement by Batiatus concerning the background of the revolt , and he remarked that " it would seem to be led by one , Spartacus , a Thracian , and another , Crixus , a Gaul . " Both of these were gladiators , but it was impossible to tell from the report how many gladiators were involved . Varinius told in detail of three separate plantations which had been put to the torch . The slaves on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain of death they were forced to join the slaverebels . Those who refused were instantly put to death . ( Gracchus nodded . That was the only way it could be put . ) Two plantation owners had attempted to take refuge in Capua , but they were intercepted by the gladiators and slain by them , and their slaves had been forced to join the revolt . In addition to that , numbers of malcontents among the slaves of the area had run off to join the rebels . Varinius added a long list of atrocities alleged to have been committed by the slaves , and he enclosed with his report three separate depositions which had been taken and attested to . These depositions enumerated additional atrocities on the part of the slaves . He finished by stating that as far as he knew , the slaves had made their headquarters on the wild and rocky slope of Mount Vesuvius , and that he intended to march there immediately and enforce the will of the Senate upon them .  | The Senate received and accepted his report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate that some eighty escaped slaves now held for the mines be offered as tokens of punishment , " so that all slaves within the urbs might read a warning and a lesson in their fate . " The same day , these poor wretches were crucified at the Circus Maximus , in an interval during the races . They hung from their crosses while the current favorite , Aristones , a magnificent Parthion stallion , lost unexpectedly to Charos , a mare from Nubia  --  bankrupting a considerable section of the sporting blood of Rome . But no more was heard from Varinius or the City Cohorts for six days . And at the end of the time , a brief report came through . The City Cohorts had been defeated by the slaves . It was a brief report , with no supporting facts , and for twentyfour hours the Senate and the city waited in tense expectation . Everyone talked about the new slave uprising , but no one knew . Nevertheless , fear was all over the city . VI The Senate sat in whole session with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the plaza was full and the streets leading into it were blocked , and there was rumor everywhere , because now the Senate knew the story of the City Cohorts . Only one or two of the chairs were empty . Gracchus , remembering that session , decided that at such moments  --  moments of crisis and bitter knowledge  --  the Senate was at its best . The eyes of the old men , who sat so silent in their togas , were full of consequence and without troubled fear , and the faces of the younger men were hard and angry . But all of them were acutely conscious of the dignity of the Roman Senate , and within that context Gracchus could relinquish his cynicism . He knew these men ; he knew by what cheap and perverted means they purchased their seats and what a dirty
