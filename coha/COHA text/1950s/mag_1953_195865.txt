In jet engines , the U.S. and Britain are running a seesaw race for the title of the " most powerful " ( see chart ) . Last week it looked as if Britain 's De Havilland Engine Co. , Ltd. had jumped out ahead ; it announced a new engine , the Gyron , with a thrust " greater than that of any other known jet engine . " Although performance figures were kept secret , airmen guessed that the Gyron is in the 15,000-Ib. - thrust class , compared to 10,000 to 12,000 Ibs. for the current model of Pratt &; Whitney 's J-57 , which had been rated the world 's most powerful . <P> The Gyron is an axial-flow engine , intended for use in supersonic aircraft , while all De Havilland 's previous jets ( e.g. , the Goblin , which powers the Vampire fighter , and the Ghost , which powers the Comet and the Venom fighter ) , have been centrifugal types. * De Havilland said that the engine , which has low gas consumption and a low ratio of weight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , later could be built for transports . Said De Havilland : the Gyron is the first of " a new generation of really large turbine-jet power units . The company is confident that it will prove to be one of the principal power units ... up to about 1965 . " <P> <P> * An axial-flow engine draws in air with a series of compressor blades which send the air to the combustion chamber in a direct line . A centrifugal-flow jet draws in the air with fewer but larger blades , and throws the air out around the circumference of the compressor on its way to the combustion chamber . Since an axial-flow engine has a smaller diameter , it is easier to fit into planes .
