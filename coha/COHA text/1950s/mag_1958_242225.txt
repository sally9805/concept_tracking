From a vast , air-conditioned restaurant with sweeping glass windows , thin , tanned women and fat , pale men peered over thick steaks and cool drinks at the dirt track below . Roosevelt Raceway , the orange-and-magenta pleasure dome at Westbury , N.Y . was having its biggest harness-racing season in history . A record $144 million had been bet in the first 82 days of the meeting . For the highlight Messenger Stake* prize money had reached $108,565 , making it the richest pacing race of all time . <P> Set Down . Early elimination trials narrowed the field to ten of the nation 's best three-year-olds , driven by the nation 's top drivers . But the best all-round harness man of them all was not driving . Balding , twinkly Del Miller was sweating out a 15-day suspension , imposed by the stewards for his driving in an earlier Roosevelt race . Miller had pulled back at the halfway mark , presumably to find a hole along the rail . There was no hole . He came in last , was promptly set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win . " <P> Even under suspension 45-year-old Del Miller was still the dominating presence at Roosevelt . In fact , in the last ten years he has become the dominant figure in the whole sport . Raised on his family 's breeding farm in Pennsylvania , Del Miller has won a dazzling reputation as a breeder and trainer . His most spectacular success came in 1948 , when he bought a stallion named Adios for $21,000 . Adios earned him $1,000,000 in stud fees and sales of yearlings before he sold the horse for $500,000 to the Hanover farm in 1955 . Adios ' progeny hold some seven world records . <P> All My Children . Of the ten Messenger entries , four were offspring of Adios-Raider Frost , Ike Frost , Adios Paul and Kwik . Two who were not were Del Miller 's own entry-a pair of colts named Thorpe Hanover and O'Brien Hanover . Owned by Pennsylvania Oilman Hugh Grant , Thorpe and O'Brien were sons of Tar Heel-another Miller-developed sire . Grant , who depends on Miller 's advice and uncanny instinct for horseflesh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a modest $13,000 and turned them over to Miller for training . In his skilled hands , they had already won $103,463 in prize money , as an entry went to the post 19-20 favorites . <P> As the gate pulled away and the race began , Del Miller watched unhappily from the clubhouse . His mood changed fast . As the pacers whipped past the three-quarter mark , his O'Brien Hanover was in the lead with Thorpe Hanover close behind . Only a final burst to second place by Tommy Winn 's Flying Time marred a straight one-two finish for Miller 's Tar Heel colts . Their first and third took $67,310.62 of the total purse . Also in the money in fourth and fifth place : Adios ' sons Raider Frost and Adios Paul . Quipped the New York News 's Wes Gaffer : " One more stakes victory and Trainer Del Miller owns Roosevelt Raceway . " <P> <P> * Named for a great , grey English race horse who retired to a rich old American studhood in 1788 . Messenger forefathered such thoroughbreds as Man o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all U.S. trotters and pacers . Messenger died at 28 in 1808 , is buried near the fairways of Long Island 's Piping Rock Country Club .
