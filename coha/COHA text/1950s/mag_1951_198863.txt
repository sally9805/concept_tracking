To make money out of politics is not necessarily illegal . Last week 's news brought some fascinating examples of the fine legalistic feathers that sometimes protect fat political birds . <P> A Diary . In Washington , an old ( 69 ) man , John Ernest Toole , told an investigating Senate subcommittee that in 1944 he was chief loan analyst for the old Small War Plants Corp . One of his last official acts was approval of a $1,671,000 loan to the American Lithofold Corp . of St. Louis . Immediately afterward , he became Lithofold 's treasurer . Nothing illegal about that . Besides , no one was questioning Toole 's integrity . The committee was interested in what he remembered about American <P> Lithofold 's subsequent loan dealings with the Government . <P> In 1948 and 1949 , with its president and his family drawing $200,000 in salaries , with some salesmen earning more than $100,000 in commissions , American Lithofold was losing money . Twice it applied for an RFC loan . Twice it was refused . Refreshing his memory from a voluminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations . Company officials held a council of war in Washington . Present was James P. Finnegan , then Federal Collector of Internal Revenue in St. Louis . No one had told Toole that Finnegan was on the corporation 's payroll . At the time , Toole could only wonder why a federal official from St. Louis was attending a company conference in Washington , and why Finnegan later handed Lithofold an $800 expense account ( for a short trip ) . ( A grand jury is now trying to determine whether there was anything illegal in this and other acts of Finnegan . ) <P> Successful Phone Call . Someone at the conference-Toole could n't remember who-mentioned the magic name of Bill Boyle , now chairman of the Democratic National Committee . The American Lithofold people went to Boyle 's Washington office . Boyle called Harley Hise , then RFC chairman , and said , " Harley , I have some friends in the office here of Jim Finnegan 's . I would like for you to arrange to see them this afternoon if possible in connection with a loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after this phone call , the loan application reached a " strange , strenuous and . . . satisfactory solution " : Lithofold received the first of three loans that were to reach a total of $645,000 . <P> The committee asked Toole if he still worked for Lithofold . He replied ruefully that he did not know . " Have any of you gentlemen ever kept a diary ? " he asked . " I 'll never keep one again . " <P> Meanwhile , before another Senate committee , Bill Boyle was busy throwing dust . Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine asked him why he permitted E. Merl ( mink coat ) Young to work for him when he was an official of the 1948 Democratic campaign . " There must be some confusion , " Boyle replied . " I was a volunteer worker in the 1948 campaign ... I held no title ... or office . . . I 've certainly striven to conduct myself as my mother would want me. "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
