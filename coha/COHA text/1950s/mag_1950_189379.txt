Stage Fright ( Warner ) is a comedy melodrama that most moviemakers could be proud of . For Director Alfred Hitchcock , who must compete with his own overpowering reputation , it is something less . Far superior to his recent , blighted Under Capricorn , it is hardly in the running with such oldtime Hitchcock classics as The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes . <P> Never a man to make things easy for himself , Director Hitchcock has tried in Stage Fright to work within the discipline of a tricky story conceit : his heroine ( Jane Wyman ) plays romantic nip &; tuck simultaneously with a suspected murderer ( Richard Todd ) and the Scotland Yard man ( Michael Wilding ) who is tracking him down . Hitchcock exploits the situation as much for chuckles as for chills . The result is an entertaining show , handsomely produced against a London background , studded with effective scenes and enlivened by an excellent cast that includes an uncannily young and beautiful Marlene Dietrich and able British Comedian Alistair Sim . <P> Even so , coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspense , it is a disappointing film . At its best , melodrama should gull the spectator into believing what he sees , if only while he is seeing it . In working out Stage Fright 's intriguing premise , Hitchcock tortures his story more than his audience , burdens them both with too obvious a load of improbabilities . <P> Nor does Hitchcock come up to his old high mark in his use of British humor . Though it tries for more laughs than it gets , the comedy is funny enough to give the script its major distinction . But the fun no longer serves the shrewd purpose to which the director put it in The Lady Vanishes , where it lent extra point to the suspense . In Stage Fright the humor is mainly incidental , and pursued at enough length to slacken the story 's tension . <P> The unalloyed virtues of the picture lie in the quality of its performances . Jane Wyman is completely winning as a student actress who tries to clear a murder suspect by impersonating the maid of a musicomedy star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's acting as the suspect will not let down moviegoers who liked him in The Hasty Heart . Comedian Sim makes his artful most of the heroine 's eccentric father . If anyone steals the show , it is Veteran Dietrich . Dressed to kill and chanting languorous ballads in a husky off-key , she creates an acid-tinged portrait of a glamorous bad lady of the theater . <P> Malaya ( MGM ) squanders Spencer Tracy , James Stewart and a name-heavy supporting cast in the kind of adventuresome folderol that lesser studios crank out regularly on small , starless budgets . Such high-priced talent probably seemed worth using while the story was still an idea based on an authentic wartime scheme : the smuggling of rubber out of Japanese-held Malaya . But the picture beats the basic idea into pulp fiction . <P> Before abandoning itself to derring-do , the film tries briefly to ring true by doggedly underplaying its account of how Stewart , a down &; out newspaperman , persuades the government to free a convicted smuggler ( Tracy ) and send the two of them off on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ill-suited to the characters and situation that it defeats its own end .
