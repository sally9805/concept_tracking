TKE WHITE WITCH ( 439 pp. ) - Elizabefh Goudge-Coward-McCann ( $4.95 ) . " 0 boro Duvel atch ' pa leste ! " cried Froniga to Yoben-meaning , in Romany , " The great Lord be on you ! " Then Froniga " came into his arms with the simplicity of a child . " But , as usual , Yoben held his fire . " I am a man to whom the love of woman is forbidden , " this stern gypsy tinker had told Froniga , and try as she would to penetrate his enigma with darts from " her long-tailed dark eyes , " Yoben was mute and cold as old pewter . <P> The setting of this latest , bestseller-bound historical novel by Elizabeth Goudge ( rhymes with Scrooge ) is 17th century England . King Charles I has put John Hampden in prison for refusing a Forced Loan , thus setting many a British taxpayer ablaze with indignation . Now , battle is joined-King v. Parliament . And though Froniga is a gypsy on her mother 's side , she is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royalist . Enter , inevitably , Oliver Cromwell , whom Novelist Goudge feels she knows intimately , including his conversation . " My lord , we must act at once ! " cries " Old Noll " Cromwell to his C. in C. , the Earl of Essex . " Let us do nothing hastily , Colonel Cromwell , " answers the slower-moving peer , then adds : " Decisive victory now would prevent incalculable suffering . " Probably , muses one character , they are saying the same thing in the enemy camp-and sure enough King Charles had told his aide , Lord Leyland : " Francis , if I can win an overwhelming victory . . . my people will be spared the misery of a long war . " <P> In Goudge novels few are ever spared . For hundred of pages , battles sway to and fro indecisively-allowing ample space in between for dispatch riding , witch hunting , potion brewing , gypsy camping , idol smashing and other 17th century pastimes . Acting as spy for Charles , Lord Leyland falls in love with Froniga 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gypsy beauty ( mother of three cute little bastards named Dinki , Meriful and Cinderella ) who hexes him with thorns stuck in his wax image . At death 's point Francis is rescued by Yoben , who proves to be a disguised Roman Catholic priest and is hanged at Henley ( near Author Goudge 's home ) in full view of poor Froniga . At last the Restoration comes . " The winter was over and ahead lay the months of color and delight . " <P> None of Author Goudge 's work seems labored ; she writes with the spontaneity of a child . Goudge fans think that in her earlier novels-Green Dolphin Street , Pilgrim 's Inn-she has already excelled herself , but The White Witch suggests that she has still not reached her peak .
