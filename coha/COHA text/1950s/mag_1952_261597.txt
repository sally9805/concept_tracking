The uncertain science of political calculus indicates that Ike can win if the 146 uncommitted delegates divide evenly . Last week there was many an indication that his break among the uncommitted may be better than 50-50 . <P> Politicians and pundits who had their binoculars trained on Michigan agreed that there were clear signals of a shift to Eisenhower . While National Committeeman Arthur Summerfield kept his silence , the word drifted through Republican conversations : Summerfield will come out for Ike at the proper moment . If he does , the Michigan delegation-now counted ten for Taft , ten for Ike and 26 uncommitted-might give as many as 40 of its 46 votes to Eisenhower . <P> Closer , Not Farther . In Pennsylvania , Governor John Fine said : " I am getting closer and closer to Eisenhower . " Then he added quickly : " The chasm between me and Taft is not broadening . " But as Fine talked , he seemed to be listing noticeably Ikeward . He found the argument that Taft ca n't win " has been most devastating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after 20 long years , do n't want to take any risk at all . " He mused at some length about a possibility : " If I should declare for Eisenhower , I think that the Taft people would feel that I have at least considered , to some extent , their feelings in this matter , too . And that , in the end , would help to create a harmonious condition in Pennsylvania and enhance our chance of carrying the state in the November elections . " <P> Listening to the words from Pennsylvania , Bob Taft became a bit impatient with the governor . Fine , said Taft , " says one thing one day and another thing the next , but I do not believe he has consciously meant to indicate a preference . " If John Fine goes to Eisenhower , up to 57 of the state 's 70 votes may be counted for Eisenhower . <P> From Taft to Ike . While Bob Taft campaigned in Virginia last week , some shifting was going on there . Two previously uncommitted delegates announced they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with them . Said Virginia 's former G.O.P. State Chairman Robert H. Woods : " In this campaign , I feel that every delegate should stand up and be for whoever he may honestly feel will more nearly assure victory ... I shall vote for the nomination of General Eisenhower . " <P> Virginia 's delegation had been counted eleven for Taft , one for Eisenhower and eleven uncommitted . At last week 's caucus , there were indications that the shift was even greater than the three announcements indicated . The delegation named a Taftman to the credentials committee by a vote of 11-10 , and elected an Ikeman to the resolutions committee by the same margin . The indication : a fairly even division between the two candidates . <P> But the shifts were not all on a one-way street . In New York , which TIME 'S tabulation has been carrying as 85 for Ike , one for Taft , ten uncommitted , Taft has made some small gains . Manhattan Delegate Richard Neville said he will vote for Taft , and in Queens , Delegate Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning Taftward . In Brooklyn , veteran G.O.P. Leader Jacob A. Livingston , a strong anti-Dewey man , announced for Taft . Although he is not a delegate , Livingston 's influence is considerable . Taft may have ten or more New York votes .
