In the big , ornate hearing room of the House Ways &; Means Committee last week , a businessman took over the chairman 's table . " For the first time in American history , " joked Clarence Randall , chairman of Inland Steel and head of the President 's Commission on Foreign Economic Policy , " Congress has made a mistake . The clock is three minutes slow . The hearings are being run on the chairman 's watch , which , I am embarrassed to say , is a Swiss watch . " <P> Not all of Randall 's colleagues were amused as he thus began his hearings on U.S. tariff policy . Two of them were Congress 's vociferous high-tariff advocates-Colorado 's Senator Eugene Millikin and Pennsylvania 's Congressman Richard Simpson , who want to keep out such things as Swiss watches . They listened with displeasure as leaders of industry , labor and agriculture trooped up to demand freer trade and lower tariffs as the only sensible means of cutting foreign aid and easing the dollar shortage . <P> Only one witness gave much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strackbein , an ex-A.F.L. representative , who now , as a paid agent , runs an outfit called the Nationwide Committee of Industry , Agriculture and Labor on Import-Export Policy . Strackbein lashed out at such free-trade advocates as Henry Ford II : " A voice from the automobile industry sneers at the ' pinpoint dislocation ' of the ' small groups ' that might be injured by freer trade . To Mr. Henry Ford , evidently the cattle and sheep and dairying industries are so many pinpoints ... managed , no doubt , by pinheads . . . " <P> Senator Millikin himself began firing potshots when one of Detroit 's leading free-traders , John S. Coleman , president of Burroughs Corp . and chairman of the Committee for a National Trade Policy , took the witness stand . Coleman , noting that the West Virginia town where he grew up used to make buggy whips , testified that it now " employs four or five times the number of people " making home freezers . Similarly , he suggested that U.S. industries not efficient enough to compete with foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What would he do about Colorado 's sugar beets , wool and mining products , all of which could be " produced and landed and sold in this country cheaper than we can ? " <P> " Senator , " replied Coleman , " . . . if we put ' m ' in place of ' c , ' you are spelling out my whole state of Michigan . We have sugar beets ... we have manufacturing . . . and we have deep-pit mining of natural copper up in the Northern Peninsula <P> . . " He added that Michigan 's copper mines could not compete with other U.S. mines and were closing down . But industry and the state had spent $25,000 on a survey and found other uses for the men and communities . He cited the dislocation of 4,000 woodworkers at Iron Mountain , Mich , when wooden station-wagon bodies went out of style . " Today we have produced at Iron Mountain chemicals , cast-iron forgings , castings and electronic instruments , and we are employing about half a thousand more than were employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
