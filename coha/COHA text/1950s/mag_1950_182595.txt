For 30 years botanists have known that plants keep their calendars straight by measuring the length of the day . A spring-flowering plant blooms when the days have reached the right length for that particular species . A fall-flowering plant blooms when the days have got short enough after the summer solstice . Both " long-day " and " short-day " plants can be fooled-by controlled lighting-into flowering out of season . <P> Last week Drs . H. A. Borthwick , M. W. Parker and S. B. Hendricks of the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that they had discovered something new about plants ' " photoperiodism . " They irradiated soybeans and other sensitive plants with narrow-wave bands of colored light from a spectroscope . Judging by the plants ' responses to different colors , the experimenters decided that plants must contain invisible amounts of a blue pigment which acts as a sort of alarm clock . The scientists do not know exactly what the powerful pigment is , but when it gets the right amount of illumination , it tells the plant to wake up and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
