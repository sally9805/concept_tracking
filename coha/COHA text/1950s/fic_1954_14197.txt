The one set is the apartment of COLONEL and MRS . PENMARK , in a suburb of a southern city . We see a tastefully furnished living room , with colonial pieces and reproductions , expensive but not too gaudy . The pictures on the walls are views of New York City in the early nineteenth century . The door to the front hall is at stage left , the door to an inner hallway at stage right , a door to the kitchen  --  which is partially visible  --  is at right rear , a door to a den containing a piano is at left rear . Large windows with heavy drapes flood the room with early morning light . There is a dining table at the bay window with chairs about it , a couch at the left with a coffee table nearby . There are two or three easy chairs in a semi-circle facing the coffee table . A rug on the floor is varicolored rag colonial . RHODA PENMARK , a neat , quaint and pretty little girl of eight , sits , seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns a page carefully , absorbed in the story . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK , a good-looking officer of thirty-five or so , comes in from the right , carrying two fairly new suitcases . He sets them down near the outer door and turns , seeing RHODA . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Why , ' morning , Rhoda ! Up , and dressed and ready for the day ! Wearing your best perfume ? p. 3 RHODA PENMARK Marking her placeYes , I am , daddy . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK That 's right , this is the day of the picnic . I hope there 's a breeze off the water . RHODA PENMARK Miss Fern says there always is . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK She says it never rains on the first of June , too . Do n't count on it . RHODA PENMARK Are you leaving today , daddy ? COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK My plane goes in an hour . Back to Washington and the Pentagon and a climate that coddles eggs . RHODA PENMARK I like coddled eggs . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK You like everything . You 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she smiles up at him RHODA PENMARK How long will you be gone ? COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Sealed orders , darling . All I know is I 'll be home as soon as I can . What will you give me if I give you a basket of kisses ? RHODA PENMARK I 'll give you a basket of hugs . He leans down to hug and kiss her COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK I like your hugs . p. 4 RHODA PENMARK I like your kisses , daddikins ! You 're so big and strong ! COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK I 'll miss you . The General does n't have one pretty girl on his whole staff ! RHODA PENMARK I wish he did n't have my daddy ! I 'll miss you every day ! COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Will you write to me ? RHODA PENMARK Do you want me to ? COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Of course I want you to . RHODA PENMARK Then I 'll write to you every day . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Every time I write to mother I 'll put in a note for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really and truly . And every time the General tells a good joke I 'll send you an official report ! RHODA PENMARK Oh , daddy , that wo n't be very often ! You 'd better send me the bad ones too ! COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Sweetheart , I will ! MRS . PENMARK comes in from the den in a becoming morning gown . She is somewhat under thirty , a very pretty , gentle and gracious woman , quite obviously dedicated to her husband and child . The kind of woman whose life is given meaning by the affection she gives and receivesI shall write daily to both my sweethearts unless somebody makes a mistake and starts a shooting war and we all have to go underground . He kisses CHRISTINE , his wife , who has brought his briefcase and goes into his arms without a word . They have said goodbye previously , but she ca n't let him go without another embrace p. 5 RHODA PENMARK Would you go underground if there was a war ? COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Yes , I would , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENMARK You said " by gum " because I was here . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK That 's right , I did . CHRISTINE PENMARK Take care . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK I will . I 'll wire you the minute we 're on the ground . Take care of each other , you two . CHRISTINE PENMARK We will . The doorbell rings a delicate little chimeThat 's Monica and Emory . They wanted to say a last goodbye to you . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Oh . He goes to the door . Meanwhile CHRISTINE looks at RHODA 'S hair RHODA PENMARK Is it all right ? CHRISTINE PENMARK It 's perfect , darling , braids and all . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK At the doorCome in , Monica . Come in , Emory . MRS . MONICA BREEDLOVE is a widow of fifty-five or so , plump , intelligent , voluble and perhaps over-friendly . Her brother , EMORY WAGES , is a few years younger than she , also plump and friendly , but in contrast almost taciturn p. 6 MONICA BREEDLOVE Just the effusive neighbors from upstairs , darlings ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own , so they live other people 's . I speak for my brother as well as myself , because he never gets a chance to speak when I 'm around . There , I 've talked enough . Say something , Colonel . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK I guess it will have to be goodbye , because the taxi 's here and I do n't want to rush through traffic . EMORY WAGES Do n't worry about your two pretty girls , Ken . We 'll keep an eye on them , and if one of them begins to look peaked , we 'll send up smoke signals . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK I 'm counting on you , Emory . He gives MONICA his handAnd on Monica . MONICA BREEDLOVE Goodbye . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Well , sweetheart , this is it . He waves across the room to RHODAGoodbye , big eyes ! RHODA PENMARK Goodbye , daddy . CHRISTINE PENMARK I promised myself I would n't come down , but  --  COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Do n't , sweet . It 's just another empty month or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm taking these . He precedes KENNETH out with both bags . KENNETH and CHRISTINE embrace p. 7 COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Goodbye . KENNETH takes his briefcase and goes out MONICA BREEDLOVE Poor boy . He hates to go . And you hate to let him go . CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'm  --  not very self-sufficient . MONICA BREEDLOVE You 're in love , both of you , you lucky characters . I wish I were . Oh , by the way , nobody has to take Rhoda to the bus , because I made some cupcakes for Miss Fern , and she 's coming by to pick them up . CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , good . MONICA BREEDLOVE To RHODABut before she comes I have two little presents for you , my darling . RHODA PENMARK Presents ? MONICA BREEDLOVE The first is from Emory . It 's a pair of dark glasses with rhinestone decorations , and he said to tell you they 're intended to keep the sun out of those pretty blue eyes . She produces the glasses , and RHODA goes toward her with an eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look " I 'll try them on you . RHODA stands obediently while MONICA adjusts the glassesNow who is this glamorous Hollywood actress ? Can it really be little Rhoda Penmark who lives with her delightful parents on the first floor of my apartment house ? p. 8 RHODA PENMARK Looking at her reflection in the glass of a pictureI like them . Where 's the case ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Here it is . And now for the second prize , which is from me . She takes from her purse a little gold heart with a chain attachedThis was given to me when I was eight years old , and it 's a little young for me now , but it 's still just right for an eight-year-old . However , it has a garnet set in it , and we 'll have to change that for a turquoise , since turquoise is your birthstone . So I 'll have it changed and cleaned , and then it 's yours . RHODA PENMARK Could I have both stones ? The garnet , too ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Rhoda ! Rhoda ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How wonderful to meet such a natural little girl ! She knows what she wants and asks for it  --  not like these overcivilized little pets that have to go through analysis before they can choose an ice cream soda ! RHODA goes to her , puts her arms around her waist and hugs her with an intensity which gives MONICA great delight RHODA PENMARK PurringAunt Monica ! Dear , sweet Aunt Monica ! MONICA is completely captivated , but CHRISTINE looks on with a slightly skeptical and concerned attitude . She knows that RHODA is not really affectionate , that she is acting p. 9 MONICA BREEDLOVE I know I 'm behind the times , but I thought children wore coveralls and play-suits to picnics . Now you , my love , look like a princess in that red and white dotted Swiss . Tell me , are n't you afraid you 'll get it dirty ? Or fall and scuff those new shoes ? CHRISTINE PENMARK She wo n't soil the dress and she wo n't scuff the shoes . Rhoda never gets anything dirty , though how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENMARK I do n't like coveralls . They 're not  --  She hesitates MONICA BREEDLOVE You mean coveralls are n't quite ladylike , do n't you , my darling ? She embraces the tolerant RHODA againOh , you old-fashioned little dear ! RHODA PENMARK Looking at the locketAm I to keep this now ? MONICA BREEDLOVE You 're to keep it till I find out where I can get the stone changed . RHODA PENMARK Then I 'll put it in my box . She goes to her table , opens a drawer and takes out a box which once held Swiss chocolates . She opens it and places the locket carefully inside . A voice says " Leroy " as the door swings open . The houseman , or JANITOR , stands in the doorway p. 10 LEROY Guess I 'm pretty early , Mrs. Penmark , but it 's my day for doing the windows on this side . CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , yes , you can begin in the bedrooms , Leroy . LEROY To MONICAExcuse me , ma'am . To RHODAMornin ' . He crosses through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room RHODA PENMARK I like garnets , but I like turquoise better . MONICA BREEDLOVE You sound like Fred Astaire , tap-tapping across the room . What have you got on your shoes ? RHODA PENMARK I run over my heels , and mother had these iron pieces put on so they 'd last longer . CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'm afraid I ca n't take any credit . It was Rhoda 's idea entirely . RHODA PENMARK I think they 're very nice . They save money . MONICA BREEDLOVE Oh , you penurious little sweetheart ! But I 'll tell you one thing , Rhoda , I think you worry too much when you 're not the very best at everything . That 's one reason Emory and I thought you should have some presents today . You wanted that penmanship medal very much , did n't you ? p. 11 RHODA PENMARK It 's the only gold medal Miss Fern gives . And it was really mine . Everybody knew I wrote the best hand and I should have had it . LEROY comes through toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some water . He goes to the kitchen RHODA PENMARK I just do n't see why Claude Daigle got the medal . CHRISTINE PENMARK These things happen to us all the time , Rhoda , and when they do we simply accept them . I 've told you to forget the whole thing . She puts an arm around RHODA , trying to soften her . RHODA pulls away impatientlyI 'm sorry . I know you do n't like people pawing over you . RHODA PENMARK It was mine ! The medal was mine ! CHRISTINE PENMARK Try to forget it , Rhoda . Put it out of your mind . RHODA PENMARK Stamping in angerI wo n't ! I wo n't ! I wo n't ! LEROY comes out of the kitchen with his pail , passes near RHODA , and manages to spill a splash of water on her shoes MONICA BREEDLOVE Leroy ! Have you completely lost your senses ? You spilled water on Rhoda 's shoes ! p. 12 LEROY I 'm sorry , ma'am . I guess I was just trying to hurry . In turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BREEDLOVE Leroy ! LEROY I 'm sorry , Mis ' Breedlove . Kneels MONICA BREEDLOVE Under her breathOne , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten ! Leroy , I own this apartment house ! I employ you ! I 've tried to give you the benefit of every doubt ! I 've thought of you as emotionally immature , torn by irrational rages , a bit on the psychopathic side ! But after this demonstration I think my diagnosis was entirely too mild ! You 're definitely a schizophrenic with paranoid overtones ! I 've had quite enough of your discourtesy and surliness  --  and so have the tenants in the building ! My brother Emory has wanted to discharge you ! I 've been on your side , though with misgivings ! I shall protect you no longer ! CHRISTINE PENMARK He did n't mean it , Monica . It was an accident , I 'm sure " it was . RHODA PENMARK He meant to do it ! I know Leroy well . MONICA BREEDLOVE It was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of a neurotic child ! p. 13 RHODA PENMARK He meant to do it . To LEROYYou made up your mind to do it when you went through the room . CHRISTINE PENMARK Rhoda ! RHODA PENMARK I was looking at you when you made up your mind to wet us . LEROY Oh , I never , I never , I 'm just clumsy ! He takes out his handkerchief and cleans RHODA 'S shoes CHRISTINE PENMARK Not wishing the man to humble himself Oh , Leroy , please , please ! RHODA draws away MONICA BREEDLOVE My patience is at an end , and you may as well know it . Go about your work ! LEROY Yes , ma'am . He goes out MONICA BREEDLOVE He has the mind of an eight-year-old , but he 's managed to produce a family so I keep him on . The doorbell ringsIt 's probably Miss Fern . CHRISTINE PENMARK Going to doorYes . Come in , Miss Fern . We 're nearly ready , I think . MISS FERN I 'm a bit ahead of time , as usual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most aristocratic school in the state she has achieved a certain savoir faire , though she is in herself a timid and undistinguished little old maid , making the most of the remains of once quite remarkable beauty p. 14 MONICA BREEDLOVE Oh , Miss Fern , the old scatterbrain left her two dozen cupcakes upstairs . Rhoda , will you help me carry them down ? RHODA PENMARK Yes , of course I will . MONICA BREEDLOVE They 're all packed . RHODA PENMARK She curtsies to MISS FERNMorning , Miss Fern . MISS FERN That 's a perfect curtsy , Rhoda . RHODA PENMARK Thank you , Miss Fern . She goes out the front door with MONICA CHRISTINE PENMARK She does such things well ? MISS FERN She does everything well . As you must know better than I. CHRISTINE PENMARK And , as a person , does she fit in well  --  at the school ? MISS FERN Let me think  --  in what way , Mrs. Penmark ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Well , Rhoda has been  --  I do n't quite know how to say it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a child . My husband and I thought that a school like yours , where you believe in discipline and the old-fashioned virtues , might perhaps teach her to be a bit more of a child . p. 15 MISS FERN Yes  --  yes , I know what you mean . In some ways , in many ways , Rhoda is the most satisfactory pupil the school has ever had . She 's never been absent . She 's never been tardy . She 's the only child in the history of the school who has made a hundred in deportment each month in every class , and a hundred in self-reliance and conservation on the playground each month for a full school year . If you had dealt with as many children as I have , you 'd realize what a remarkable record that is . And she 's the neatest little girl I 've ever encountered . CHRISTINE PENMARK Kenneth says he does n't know where she gets her tidiness . Certainly not from him or me . MISS FERN She has many good qualities . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of our children broke a window across the street and we knew that Rhoda knew who it was . When we questioned her about it , and told her it was her duty as an honorable citizen to report the offender , she just went on eating her apple , shaking her head , denying that she knew anything about it  --  and looking us over with that pitying , calculating look she has at certain times . CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , I know that look so well ! MISS FERN But that was admirable too , for she was merely being loyal to a playmate . p. 16 CHRISTINE PENMARK Then  --  do the other children like her ? Is she popular ? MISS FERN The other children ? Well , I MISS FERN hesitates , trying to think of something to say , and is saved from having to answer by the re-entry of MONICA and RHODA , carrying two small packed baskets MONICA BREEDLOVE Here we are ! MISS FERN Then I suppose we should go , for my sisters and the others will be waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be everything a picnic should be ! MISS FERN Thank you ! Come , Rhoda ! She takes one of the baskets and goes to the door RHODA PENMARK Yes , Miss Fern . She goes to be kissed by her mother MONICA BREEDLOVE Calm sea and prosperous voyage ! MISS FERN Thank you ! We 'll take care of her ! RHODA runs to MONICA for a last quick hugNo time ! We 're off ! MONICA BREEDLOVE We stole time , did n't we , Rhoda ? MISS FERN Bless you both ! She goes out with RHODA p. 17 MONICA BREEDLOVE So now the older set 's left behind with nothing to do . CHRISTINE PENMARK I could go through the dreary business of trying to make my face presentable . It happens every morning . MONICA BREEDLOVE Your face ! Think of mine ! CHRISTINE PENMARK It always makes me gloomy when Kenneth goes away . Anything could happen  --  before I see him again . There 's an old saying  --  we die a little at parting . MONICA BREEDLOVE Oh , my dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brood about it ! Why do n't we make some kind of party of this ? You 're having Emory and Reginald Tasker to lunch  --  ca n't I help with that ? CHRISTINE PENMARK What does one feed a criminologist ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Oh , prussic acid , blue vitriol , ground glass  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK Hot weather things ! MONICA BREEDLOVE Nothing would hurt Reggie . He thrives on buckets of blood and sudden death . CHRISTINE PENMARK How many mysteries has he written ? MONICA BREEDLOVE A complete set of his works would encircle the Empire State building  --  or me . Come on  --  I 'm a garrulous old hag , but I can grind glass . We 're not going to let you be lonely . They go into the kitchen together . LEROY comes in with pail and brush , and opens one of the windows , muttering to himself p. 18 LEROY That know-it-all , that Monica Breedlove , she do n't think nobody knows anything but her . I 'll show that bitch plenty . And that young trough-fed Mrs. Penmark . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could give it to her . Now Rhoda 's smart . That 's a smart little girl . She 's almost as smart as I am . She sees through me and I see through her . By damn she 's smart ! CURTAIN p. 19 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 It is 2:30 p.m. the same day . CHRISTINE has served lunch in her apartment to EMORY WAGES and his sister MONICA , also to REGINALD TASKER , a friend of theirs who writes detective stories and has made himself a minor expert in the history of crime . The luncheon dishes have mostly been removed , and the guests still linger over their iced drinks . The men have taken off their coats . TASKER and EMORY are laughing as the curtain goes up . MONICA BREEDLOVE But I did meet him ! Nobody ever believes that I met Sigmund Freud  --  EMORY WAGES Now , come  --  they believe you  --  MONICA BREEDLOVE You mean it 's automatic flattery . They know I 'm old enough , but they voice doubts to make me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Dr. Freud who analyzed me ; it was Dr. Kettlebaum in London . EMORY WAGES Now we 're off . MONICA BREEDLOVE And this was my choice , too . Not that I minimize Freud 's professional standing , for I still consider him the great genius of our time  --  but Dr. Kettlebaum was more  --  more simpatico , if you know what I mean , Reggie . p. 20 EMORY WAGES It means simpatico , if you know what that means . MONICA BREEDLOVE Freud loathed American women  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Especially those that talked back to him , and I loathed his Germanic prejudice against feminine independence , which he could n't conceal . CHRISTINE PENMARK Was Freud prejudiced ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Indeed he was . Not consciously , you know . He just bristled when I suggested that women had more sense than men . Now Dr. Kettlebaum believed in the power of the individual soul , and considered sex of only trivial interest . His mind was less literal , more mystic , like my own . CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Well , it broke up my marriage . I looked into the very bottom of my soul . What a spectacle ! When I came back I asked Mr. Breedlove for a divorce and he did n't oppose it . Then ' I decided that what I 'd always really wanted was to make a home for my brother  --  and so I did . I do n't think dear Emory appreciates it , but what woman  --  EMORY WAGES I can stand anything except talk about your analysis  --  and analyzing of your friends  --  and me . I do n't want to look at the bottom of my soul . p. 21 MONICA BREEDLOVE I can understand that perfectly . We 're all so sensitive about these things . The truth absolutely disgusts us . Now I 've come to the conclusion that Emory is a " larvated homosexual "  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK What ? EMORY WAGES Thank you ! What does larvated mean ? MONICA BREEDLOVE It means covered as with a masque  --  concealed . REGINALD TASKER It means something that has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can say that again . If I 'm a homosexual , they 'll have to change the whole concept of what goes on among ' em . REGINALD TASKER Where do you get that idea , Monica ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Pure association , the best evidence of all . Emory 's fifty-two years old , and he 's never married . I doubt if he 's ever had a serious love affair . EMORY WAGES How would you know if they 're serious ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Please , let 's look at things objectively . What are Emory 's deepest interests in life ? They are  --  She counts them on her fingers  --  fishing , murder mysteries in which housewives are dismembered , canasta , baseball games , and singing in male quartets . How does Emory spend Sundays ? He spends them on a boat with Reggie and other men  --  fishing . And are there ladies present on these occasions ? There are not . p. 22 EMORY WAGES You 're damned right there are not ! MONICA BREEDLOVE I guess you are all shocked , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , homosexuality is triter than incest . Dr. Kettlebaum considered it was all a matter of personal preference . I 'm perfectly frank about myself . Subconsciously I have an incestuous fixation on Emory . It 's not normal , but that 's the way it is . EMORY WAGES Thanks a million , little sister . Ca n't we talk about something normal , like murder ? Anybody mind if I smoke a cigar ? MONICA BREEDLOVE What are you trying to prove , Emory ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Let 's relax away from the table and have our tea over here . MONICA BREEDLOVE Yes , we 've run through sex , let 's try homicide . Reggie , you 're the expert . EMORY WAGES Any change is for the better . REGINALD TASKER All right , I 'll oblige . I 've been collecting data on Mrs. Allison lately . News Budget wants an article on her , but I ca n't say she 's a very flaming subject . Just an unimaginative nurse who decided she was in a position to kill folks off for their insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . EMORY WAGES Was this recent ? p. 23 REGINALD TASKER Well , last year and the year before . She 'd be going still only she was too stupid to vary her poisons , with the result that all her victims had similar symptoms  --  nausea , burning throat , intestinal pain and convulsions  --  to say nothing of the conventional life insurance policies made out to the old girl with the arsenic . CHRISTINE PENMARK Please , I do n't like to hear about such things . MONICA BREEDLOVE You do n't ? CHRISTINE PENMARK No . MONICA BREEDLOVE Now that 's an interesting psychic block . Why would Christine dislike hearing about murders ? CHRISTINE PENMARK I do n't know  --  I have an aversion to violence of any kind . I even hate the revolver Kenneth keeps in the house . MONICA BREEDLOVE Oh , do you dislike the revolver more than the poisons ? CHRISTINE PENMARK I hate them both . MONICA BREEDLOVE Hmm , perhaps if you 'll try saying the first thing that comes into your mind we can get at the root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to you ! Tell your story , Reggie , and Christine will associate . EMORY WAGES Oh , nonsense , Monica . p. 24 CHRISTINE PENMARK What do you mean by " associate ? " MONICA BREEDLOVE Just speak up  --  because any idea that comes into your mind will be an associated idea . CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh . REGINALD TASKER Well , the end of the story was like this . Toward the middle of May , last year , Mrs. Allison visited her sister-in-law 's family . She got there in time for lunch , and her niece Shirley reminded her that she had promised to bring a present for her birthday . Mrs. Allison was so upset about forgetting the present that she went to the neighborhood store and bought candy and soft drinks for the family . MONICA BREEDLOVE Nudging CHRISTINEDo you think of anything ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , absolutely nothing . REGINALD TASKER Actually Mrs. Allison had brought her niece a present . It was ten cents ' worth of arsenic . MONICA BREEDLOVE But there must be something in your mind  --  something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of how devoted the Fern sisters were to my father , when he was a radio commentator . MONICA BREEDLOVE Hmm  --  I do n't think I understand that  --  so far . How did you know of this ? p. 25 CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , they spoke of it when I entered Rhoda in their school . EMORY WAGES Is n't your father Richard Bravo ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . EMORY WAGES Yes , I thought so . Well , the whole nation was devoted to him during the last war . REGINALD TASKER Yes , listened to Bravo every evening . MONICA BREEDLOVE Is there any more of the story ? REGINALD TASKER Yes . When Mrs. Allison returned from the store she opened a bottle of sarsaparilla for her niece , and then watched the little girl 's convulsions for an hour  --  MONICA BREEDLOVE Now  --  without thinking at all  --  what 's your second association ? CHRISTINE hesitatesNo editing  --  no skipping  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK Well , what I was thinking was even sillier . I 've always had a feeling that I was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real parents . MONICA BREEDLOVE Oh , you poor innocent darling ! Do n't you know that the changeling fantasy is one of the commonest of childhood ? I once believed I was a foundling with royal blood  --  Plantagenet , I think it was . Emory was a Tudor . But have you really always had this  --  suspicion  --  that you were adopted ? p. 26 CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , always . MONICA BREEDLOVE But no evidence ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Only that I dream about it . MONICA BREEDLOVE What kind of dream ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , Monica , must I tell my dreams tod ? I 'd rather hear the murder story . MONICA BREEDLOVE Well , let 's hear more story , then hear more from Christine . EMORY WAGES Why do you always want to dig at people 's insides ? Monica , you 're a ghoul . MONICA BREEDLOVE Of course , who is n't ? Furnish the final details , Reggie . REGINALD TASKER Well , Mrs. Allison hurried back to town on an urgent errand.She had n't paid the current premium on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last day of grace . EMORY WAGES Stupid ! REGINALD TASKER Allison was certainly crude . But there have been artists in her line , really gifted operators like Bessie Denker . Bessie never made a mistake , never left a trace , never committed an imperfect crime  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK Suddenly interestedWho was this ? p. 27 REGINALD TASKER The most amazing woman in all the annals of homicide , Bessie Denker , She was beautiful , she was brainy , and she was ruthless . She never used the same poison twice . Her own father , for example , died of rabies , contracted supposedly from a mad dog . It just happened that all his money went to Bessie  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK Did you say Bessie Denker ? REGINALD TASKER Yes . CHRISTINE PENMARK Excuse me . I , I think  --  I  --  EMORY WAGES I guess Christine has had enough of this , Reggie . Could n't we talk about something else ? REGINALD TASKER We certainly could . MONICA BREEDLOVE And we will  --  though I 'm still puzzled  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMORY WAGES If you leave it to Monica , she has three subjects : sex , psychiatry , and pills . Sex and psychiatry are synonymous . Better try pills . MONICA BREEDLOVE By pills Emory means the modern pharmaceutical discoveries which have revolutionized medicine since 1935 . If you took them , Emory , you 'd be a better man . REGINALD TASKER Looking at his watchI should have looked at this before . I 've got a lecture date at three-thirty , and I wo n't be much ahead of time if I start now . Will you forgive me for filling the air with horror stories , Mrs. Penmark ? p. 28 CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , you must forgive me , Mr. Tasker ! I have some kind of phobia or mania so that I 'm quite unreasonable when I hear such things . REGINALD TASKER I 'm sick of the bloody stuff myself and only keep on with it to make a living  --  so let 's be friends . He puts out a hand . CHRISTINE shakes with him CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monica . MONICA BREEDLOVE Goodbye , Bluebeard . EMORY WAGES Goodbye , Reggie . See you Sunday . I hear the red-fish are running . TASKER goes out REGINALD TASKER From outsideGood . EMORY WAGES I wonder if it would n't be about time for the news . He goes to the radioDo you mind , Christine ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Of course not . I 'll just clear these off . MONICA BREEDLOVE I 'll lend a hand . The women carry plates into the kitchen . EMORY finds the local news broadcast THE RADIO " Nothing more important has happened for many years in the field of foreign affairs . " There is a brief pause , then the voice proceeds on a somewhat different note " I interrupt this broadcast to  --  I have been asked to announce that one of the children on the annual outing of the Fern Grammar School was accidentally drowned in the bay this afternoon . The name of the victim is being withheld until the parents are first notified . More news of the tragic affair is expected momentarily . This is Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought to you by Pickets Hardware , Best For Your Home Needs . " MONICA and CHRISTINE hurry into the room , listening . MONICA puts her arm around CHRISTINE . EMORY turns the voice down p. 29 MONICA BREEDLOVE It was not Rhoda . Rhoda is too self-reliant a child . It was some timid , confused youngster , afraid of its own shadow . It certainly was n't Rhoda . EMORY turns the radio up THE RADIO " To return to local affairs , I am now authorized to give the name of the victim of the drowning at the Fern School picnic . It was Claude Daigle , the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Dwight Daigle of 126 Willow Street . He appears to have fallen into the water from an abandoned wharf on the Fern property . It is a mystery how the little boy got on the wharf , for all the children had been forbidden to play near or on it , but his body was found off the end of the landing , wedged among the pilings . The guards who brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bruises on the forehead and hands , but it is assumed these were caused by the body washing against the pilings . And now back to the national news . " EMORY turns the radio off CHRISTINE PENMARK Poor child  --  poor little boy ! MONICA BREEDLOVE They 'll send the children home immediately . They must be on their way now . EMORY WAGES This will be the end of the picnic . CHRISTINE PENMARK I do n't know what to say to her . Rhoda is eight . I remember I did n't know about death  --  or it did n't touch me closely  --  till I was much older . A teacher I adored died . My whole world changed and darkened . p. 30 MONICA BREEDLOVE We 'd better go . This is no time for well-meaning friends to look on from the sidelines . CHRISTINE PENMARK I do n't know what to say to her ! EMORY WAGES You 'll meet it better alone . Honestly you will . MONICA BREEDLOVE Yes , you will , dear . We 'll go . It 's between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , I suppose so . EMORY WAGES Children get these shocks all the time . Life 's a grim business . CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'm glad you were here . She 'll have missed lunch , so I 'll make her a sandwich . MONICA BREEDLOVE We 'll be upstairs in case you need us . CHRISTINE PENMARK Thank you , Monica . Thank you both . MONICA and EMORY go out . The clock strikes once  --  three-thirty . CHRISTINE carries some dishes from the table to the kitchen , leaving the table practically clear . The door opens while she is in the kitchen and RHODA comes in , quiet and unruffled . She sits and removes her shoes . CHRISTINE re-enters from the kitchen CHRISTINE PENMARK Darling ! p. 31 RHODA PENMARK Mother , you know we did n't really have our lunch because Claude Daigle was drowned . CHRISTINE PENMARK I know . It was on the radio . RHODA PENMARK He was drowned , so then they were all rushing and calling and hurrying to see if they could make him alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the picnic was over and we had to go home . CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'm glad you 're home ! RHODA PENMARK So could I have a peanut-butter sandwich and milk ? CHRISTINE puts her arm around her CHRISTINE PENMARK Did you see him , dear ? RHODA PENMARK Yes , of course . Then they put a blanket over him . CHRISTINE PENMARK Did you see him taken from the water ? RHODA PENMARK Yes , they laid him out on the lawn and worked and worked . But it did n't help . CHRISTINE PENMARK You must try to get these pictures out of your mind . I do n't want you to be frightened or bothered at all . These things happen and we must accept them . RHODA PENMARK I thought it was exciting . Could I have the peanut-butter sandwich ? p. 32 CHRISTINE PENMARK Taking away her arm , risingYes , I 'm getting it ready for you . She goes into the kitchen . RHODA puts her shoes in the cupboard and takes out skates . CHRISTINE enters with a glass of milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're controlling yourself very well , but just the same it was an unfortunate thing to see and remember . I understand how you feel , my darling . RHODA PENMARK I do n't know what you 're talking about . I do n't feel any way at all . She tastes the milk . CHRISTINE is puzzled . RHODA , feeling that she has displeased her mother somehow , grabs CHRISTINE 'S hand and rubs it against her cheek CHRISTINE PENMARK Have you been naughty ? RHODA PENMARK Why , no , mother . What will you give me if I give you a basket of kisses ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Feeling a great rush of affectionI 'll give you a basket of hugs ! RHODA PENMARK I want to go out and skate on the asphalt . CHRISTINE PENMARK Then you should , dear . CHRISTINE goes to the kitchen to do the dishes . RHODA puts the skates on . LEROY opens the door and comes in to empty waste baskets p. 33 LEROY Under his breathHow come you go skating and enjoying yourself when your poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Looks to me like you 'd be in the house crying your eyes out ; either that or be in church burning a candle in a blue cup . RHODA stares at LEROY but gives no answer . Then with her sandwich in her hand , she gets up and walks on her skates to the door RHODA PENMARK ' Bye , mother ! CHRISTINE PENMARK From the kitchenGoodbye , Rhoda . LEROY Ask me , and I 'll say you do n't even feel sorry for what happened to that little boy . RHODA PENMARK Why should I feel sorry ? It was Claude Daigle got drowned , not me . She goes out . LEROY shakes his head CURTAIN p. 34 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 It is evening of the same day and RHODA , ready for bed , is lying on the couch while her mother reads to her . A pillow from her bedroom is under her head , and a half-empty glass sits on the coffee-table beside her . CHRISTINE PENMARK Reading " Then the knight alit from his steed and sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a path appearing he began to make his way along it and it began at that time to grow dark . The knight had not gone more than a dozen paces before he saw beside the path a beautiful lady who laid out a fair damask cloth under an oak and set thereon cates and dainties and a flagon with two silver cups . " She pauses RHODA PENMARK Mother ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . RHODA PENMARK Why are n't you reading ? CHRISTINE PENMARK I was just thinking . RHODA PENMARK What about ? The accident ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Partly  --  and about my phone call . The circuits were busy . RHODA PENMARK What are cates and dainties ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Little cakes , I think . p. 35 RHODA PENMARK Oh . CHRISTINE PENMARK Reading " and set thereon cates and dainties and a flagon with two silver cups . Knight , she called , ' knight , come eat and drink with me , for you are hungry and thirsty and I am alone . ' " Did you take your vitamins , dear ? RHODA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glassI took one before . This is the second . I was saving them because I like the juice . She lies backThis is wonderful , to have you read to me out here . CHRISTINE PENMARK You 'd better take the third one now .  --  You 'll be too sleepy . RHODA PENMARK All right . She sits up and takes another capsule and the last of the drink , then lies back I 'll close my eyes , but I wo n't be asleep . CHRISTINE PENMARK I know . She reads " Then the knight answered her , I thank you , fair lady , for I am not only hungry and thirsty but I am lost within the forest. Then he let his palfrey graze nearby and he feasted with the lady , who gave him loving looks , sweeter than the wine from the flagon , though the wine was sweet and strong , and in this fashion the time passed till the light was gone out of the wood and it was dark . " She pauses " The knight heard the music of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood nearby under the oak trees , lighted by a torch at the entrance where there were servants going to and fro . And he was aware that the pavilion had not been there in the daylight , but had been created out of darkness  --  by magic  --  " Rhoda ? Rhoda ? There 's no answer . CHRISTINE rises , takes the empty glass to the kitchen , returns and bends over RHODA to pick her up . The phone rings . CHRISTINE goes quickly to answer it , so that it wo n't wake the child . She picks up the receiverYes , I was calling Washington , D.C. Yes , Bethesda 7-1293 . Mr. Richard Bravo . That 's right . Daddy ? I 'm so glad I found you at home ! I 've been trying to get you all evening . You said in your letter you might be coming to Tallahassee ? Are you well enough to be doing such things ? Well that 's not really far from here  --  Could n't you come to see me ? Daddy , could n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can ?  --  No , we 're well . It 's not that . You met Kenneth at the airport ? Tell him I 'm writing my first letter to him tonight . I 'll send it Air Mail Special in the morning .  --  Tell him I love him and miss him . And remember I love you and miss you .  --  No , nothing like that . Daddy , do you remember that recurrent dream I used to have when I was a child ?  --  Now , I 'm beginning to have it again and again .  --  I know what the Freudians say  --  but even they tell you dreams ca n't come out of any past but your own !  --  Tell me , daddy , is there some terrible thing in my past that I do n't know ? No  --  nobody . It 's something I dream . Yes , I 'll be good . And I will see you ? You always help ! You always have ! I do feel better . Already . Good night , daddy . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch , watches her a moment , then picks her up and carries her to her room p. 36 CURTAIN p. 37 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 Midmorning , a few days later , in the same apartment . The living room is empty ; RHODA can be heard practicing " Au Clair de la Lune " on the piano in the den . CHRISTINE is in the kitchen . The doorbell chimes and she answers it . MISS FERN is at the door . MISS FERN May I come in , Mrs. Penmark ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , of course , Miss Fern . I meant to come and see you . I got your note . MISS FERN EnteringWe 're in such distress , all of us at the school , and we 've suffered such a blow , losing one of the children that way , I 'm sure you 'll excuse us for going over and over things ! CHRISTINE PENMARK I think everybody has been puzzled and worried and saddened . MISS FERN I do n't think I 've ever known any happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I can help so few of them . I 've just come from seeing Mrs. Daigle . Of course , our first thought was of her . The rest of us are touched only lightly by this tragedy . She will have to live with it the rest of her days . CHRISTINE PENMARK I know . MISS FERN I have seen her several times , and each time she has asked me to find out from you if you had any possible clue to where the penmanship medal might be . p. 38 CHRISTINE PENMARK It was lost ? MISS FERN Yes , it was n't found with the body and has completely disappeared . CHRISTINE PENMARK I did n't know of this . At this moment RHODA comes out with a book in her hand , dressed immaculately as usual RHODA PENMARK CurtsyingGood morning , Miss Fern . MISS FERN Good morning , Rhoda . RHODA PENMARK Mother , could I sit under the scuppernong arbor for a while and read my book ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Of course , Rhoda . RHODA PENMARK It 's shady there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch me from the window , and I like to be where you can see me . CHRISTINE PENMARK Is it a new book ? RHODA PENMARK Yes . It 's Elsie Dinsmore . The one I got for a prize at Sunday school . CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'll be here . RHODA PENMARK I 'll be right there all the time . Goodbye , Miss Fern . Curtsy . She runs out MISS FERN It did occur to me that  --  that Rhoda might have told you a detail or two which she had n't remembered when she talked with me . You see , she was the last to see the little Daigle boy alive  --  p. 39 CHRISTINE PENMARK Are you sure of that ? MISS FERN Yes . CHRISTINE PENMARK I had n't realized  --  MISS FERN About an hour after we arrived at the estate one of our older pupils came on Rhoda and the Daigle boy at the far end of the grounds . The boy was upset and crying , and Rhoda was standing in front of him , blocking his path . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her . She was just about to intervene when Rhoda shoved the boy and snatched at his medal , but he broke away and ran down the beach in the direction of the old wharf where he was later found . Rhoda followed him , not running , just walking along , taking her time , the older girl said . CHRISTINE PENMARK Has it occurred to you that the older girl might not be telling the truth ? MISS FERN That is n't at all likely . She was one of the monitors we 'd appointed to keep an eye on the younger children . She 's fifteen and has been with us since kindergarten days . No , Mrs. Penmark , she was telling precisely what she saw . We know her well . CHRISTINE PENMARK And that was the last time Claude was seen ? MISS FERN Yes . A little later  --  it might have been about noon  --  one of the guards saw Rhoda coming off the wharf . He shouted a warning , but by then she was on the beach again and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the girl by name , but she was wearing a red dress , he said , and Rhoda was the only girl who wore a dress that day . At one o'clock the lunch bell rang and Claude was missing when the roll was called . You know the rest , I think . p. 40 CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . But this is very serious  --  that Rhoda was on the wharf  --  MISS FERN Not serious , really , when you 've seen as much of how children behave as I have . Children conceal things from adults . Suppose Rhoda did follow the Daigle child onto the wharf  --  so many things could have happened quite innocently . He may have hidden himself in the old boathouse , and then , when discovered , may have backed away from Rhoda and fallen in the water . CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , that could have happened . MISS FERN Now Claude , although he looked frail , was an excellent swimmer  --  and , of course , Rhoda knew that . Once he was in the water she would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the treacherous pilings were at the exact spot where he fell ? CHRISTINE PENMARK No . MISS FERN Perhaps the thought in Rhoda 's mind when he fell in the water was that he 'd ruin his new suit and she 'd get a scolding for causing it . When he did n't swim ashore at once she may have thought , with the logic of childhood , that he 'd hidden under the wharf to frighten her  --  or to escape her . Later on , when it was too late to do anything , she was afraid to admit what had happened . CHRISTINE PENMARK Then you think she does know something she has n't told ? p. 41 MISS FERN Yes . I think that , like many a frightened soldier , she deserted under fire . This is not a serious charge . Few of us are courageous when tested . CHRISTINE PENMARK She has lied , though . MISS FERN Is there any adult who has n't lied ? Smooth the lines from your brow , my dear . You 're so much prettier when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FERN I wish you would , though I doubt that you 'll learn more than you know . CHRISTINE PENMARK And there 's something I want to ask you . There was a floral tribute at Claude 's funeral sent by the children of the Fern School . I suppose the children shared the expense  --  but I have n't been asked to pay my part of it . MISS FERN The tribute was n't nearly so expensive as the papers seemed to think . The money has been collected , and the flowers paid for . CHRISTINE PENMARK Perhaps you telephoned me , and I was out . MISS FERN No , my dear . We thought perhaps you 'd want to send flowers individually . CHRISTINE PENMARK But why should we have sent flowers individually ? Rhoda was n't friendly with the boy , and my husband and I had never met the Daigles. p. 42 MISS FERN I do n't know , my dear . I really  --  there are three of us , you know , and in the hurry of making decisions  --  She pauses CHRISTINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that you did n't ask me to help pay for the flowers  --  and the reasons you give for not asking me are obviously specious . Does this mean that in your mind , and the minds of your sisters , there is some connection between the drowning and Rhoda 's presence on the wharf ? MISS FERN I refuse to believe there is any connection . CHRISTINE PENMARK And yet you have acted as if there were . MISS FERN Yes , perhaps we have . CHRISTINE PENMARK This is a terrible tragedy for Mrs. Daigle , as you say . She has lost her only son . But if there were any shadow over Rhoda  --  from what has happened  --  I shall have to live under it , too  --  and my husband . As for Rhoda  --  she would not be happy in your school next year . MISS FERN No , she would not . And since she would not , it would be as well to make up our minds now that she will not be there . CHRISTINE PENMARK Then there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be invited to return to the Fern School ? p. 43 MISS FERN Yes . We have made that decision . CHRISTINE PENMARK But you ca n't tell me why ? MISS FERN I think her behavior in the matter of the medal would be sufficient explanation . She has no sense of fair play . She 's a poor loser . She does n't play the game . CHRISTINE PENMARK But you 're not saying that Rhoda had anything to do with Claude 's death ? MISS FERN Of course not ! Such a possibility never entered our minds ! At this moment the doorbell chimes CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'd better answer . MISS FERN Of course , my dear . CHRISTINE goes to the door , hesitates a moment , and then opens it . MR. and MRS . DAIGLE come in , he tentatively , she boldly . She has been drinking CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes ? MRS . DAIGLE Thanks . We 're Mrs. Daigle and Mr. Daigle . You did n't have to let us in , you know . To MISS FERNYou realize we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a little drunk . To CHRISTINEI guess you never get a little drunk . CHRISTINE PENMARK You 're quite welcome , both of you . p. 44 MRS . DAIGLE Oh , pay no attention to him . He 's all for good breeding . He was trying to stop me . Now , you , Mrs. Penmark . You 've always had plenty . You 're a superior person . CHRISTINE PENMARK No , I 'm not . MRS . DAIGLE Oh , yes . Father was rich . Rich Richard Bravo . I know . Now I worked in a beauty parlor . Miss Fern used to come there . She looks down on me . MISS FERN Please , Mrs. Daigle ! MRS . DAIGLE I was that frumpy blonde . Now I 've lost my boy and I 'm a lush . Everybody knows it . MR . DAIGLE We 're worried about Mrs. Daigle . She 's under a doctor 's care . She 's not herself . MRS . DAIGLE But I know what I 'm about just the same . Just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite aware that you come from a higher level of society . You prolly made a debut and all that . I always considered Christine such a gentle name . Hortense sounds fat  --  that 's me , Hortense . " My girl Hortense , " that 's what they used to sing at me , " Has n't got much sense . Let 's write her name on the privy fence . " Children can be nasty , do n't you think ? MR . DAIGLE Please , Hortense . MRS . DAIGLE You 're so attractive , Christine . You have such exquisite taste in clothes , but of course you have amples of money to buy ' em with . What I came to see you about , I asked Miss Fern how did Claude happen to lose the medal , and she would n't tell me a thing . p. 45 MISS FERN I do n't know , Mrs. Daigle . Truly . MRS . DAIGLE You know more than you 're telling . You 're a sly one  --  because of the school . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you know more than you 're telling , Miss Butter-Wouldn't-Melt Fern . There 's something funny about the whole thing . I 've said so over and over to Mr. Daigle . He married quite late , you know . In his forties . But I was n't exactly what the fellow calls a " spring chicken " either . We wo n't have any more children . No more . MR . DAIGLE Please , Hortense . Let me take you home where you can rest . MRS . DAIGLE Rest . Sleep . When you ca n't sleep at night , you ca n't sleep in the daylight . I lie and look at the water where he went down . There 's something funny about the whole thing , Christine . I heard that your little girl was the last who saw him alive . Will you ask her about the last few minutes and tell me what she says ? Maybe she remembers some little thing . I do n't care how small it is ! No matter how small ! You know something , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't tell me . Oh , my poor little Claude ! What did they do to you ? CHRISTINE goes to MRS . DAIGLE and puts her arm around her CHRISTINE PENMARK I will ask Rhoda , Hortense . Oh , if I only knew ! p. 46 MRS . DAIGLE Somebody took the medal off his shirt , Christine . It could n't come off by accident . I pinned it on myself , and it has a clasp that locks in place . It was no accident . You can wear such simple things , ca n't you ? I never could wear simple things . I could n't even buy ' em . When I got ' em home they did n't look simple .  --  He was such a lovely , dear little boy . He said I was his sweetheart . He said he was going to marry me when he grew up . I used to laugh and say , " You 'll forget me long before then . You 'll find a prettier girl , and you 'll marry her . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I wo n't , because there 's not a prettier girl in the whole world than you are . " If you do n't believe me , ask the girl who comes in and cleans . She was present at the time . MR . DAIGLE Hortense  --  Hortense ! MRS . DAIGLE Why do you put your arms around me ? You do n't give a damn about me . You 're a superior person and all that , and I 'm  --  oh , God forgive me ! There were those bruises on his hands , and that peculiar crescent-shaped mark on his forehead that the undertaker covered up . He must have bled before he died . That 's what the doctor said . And where 's the medal ? Who took the medal ? I have a right to know what became of the penmanship medal ! If I knew , I 'd have a good idea what happened to him .  --  I do n't know why you took it on yourself to put your arms around me ? I 'm as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . He won the medal , and she didn't.  --  I 'm drunk . It 's a pleasure to stay drunk when your little boy 's been killed . Maybe I 'd better lay down . p. 47 MR . DAIGLE We 'll go home , and you can lie down there . MRS . DAIGLE Why not ? Why not go home , and lay down ? MR . DAIGLE I 'm sorry . MRS . DAIGLE Oh , who cares what they think ? I drank a half bottle of bonded corn in little sips . I 'm drunk as holy hell . The DAIGLES go out CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , the poor woman ! MISS FERN I 've tried to think of any little thing I could to tell her . But nothing helps . CHRISTINE PENMARK Nothing will ever help . MISS FERN No.  --  I 'll be getting back . Thank you for bearing with her , and with me . CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'll try again with Rhoda . There 's no help for that poor creature , She indicates the doorbut I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can . Goodbye , Mrs. Penmark . CHRISTINE PENMARK Goodbye , Miss Fern . She suddenly goes to MISS FERN as she is about to turn in the doorway , and kisses her , her eyes filling with tearsShe will have to live with it till she dies . p. 48 MISS FERN Yes . Till she dies . Thank you . She goes , closing the door . CHRISTINE turns and looks at the apartment , then goes to the window from which she can see RHODA . After a moment she waves , and we know that RHODA has looked up from her book . The telephone rings , and CHRISTINE answers CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , yes , speaking .  --  Oh , Kenneth , I 'm so glad you called ! She 's well and I 'm well . The little boy who was drowned ? Oh , no , Rhoda 's her usual self . She 's across the street where I can look out and see her reading a book . Do you really , darling ?  --  I hope it wo n't be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Call me as often as you can , darling ! I love you . Then do n't be late . Goodbye , dear . She hangs up and MONICA opens the door CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , Monica . MONICA BREEDLOVE Yes , Christine , the fluttery one with the typically inane conversation , but I do have an errand this time , not just gab  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK Come in , please . MONICA BREEDLOVE EnteringIt 's Rhoda 's locket I 'm using for an excuse . I 've actually found a place where they 'll engrave and clean it in one day . They did n't agree to this unusual effort without a little pressure  --  in fact , I had to threaten  --  p. 49 CHRISTINE PENMARK Not really ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Oh , you do n't know the old busybody . She uses pressure , influence , bribery , blackmail  --  and I had to pull them all on old Mr. Pageson . He said this little job would take at least two weeks  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'll get the locket . I know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him straight that I 'm handling the Community Chest again this year , and if he were as busy as all that , I 'd be happy to revise my estimate of his contribution upward by a considerable amount . CHRISTINE has opened RHODA 'S table drawer and found the locket in the chocolate box . Her fingers feel something under the oilcloth lining of the drawer and she extracts it also , concealing it from MONICA , but turning toward her with the locketAh , you found it ! The darling ! She keeps her treasures so carefully it 's a kind of miserly delight . CHRISTINE PENMARK Shall I wrap it ? MONICA BREEDLOVE No , no ! I 'll just drop it in my purse . She does soAnd now I 'll take to the air , dear Christine  --  only do forgive me bursting in and rushing out ! CHRISTINE PENMARK No ceremony , please . p. 50 MONICA BREEDLOVE No ceremony , no ; just plain pragmatism ! Goodbye , darling . CHRISTINE PENMARK Goodbye , Monica . MONICA goes out . CHRISTINE regards the medal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulity . After a moment she goes to the window from which RHODA was seen . Evidently RHODA is not there . She turns from the window and sits on the couch , staring at the medal . The door opens and RHODA comes in quietly RHODA PENMARK Did you want me to come in , mother ? When you waved ? CHRISTINE PENMARK So you had the medal , after all . Claude Daigle 's medal . She puts it on coffee table RHODA PENMARK WarilyWhere did you find it ? CHRISTINE PENMARK How did the penmanship medal happen to be hidden under the lining of the drawer of your table ? Tell me the truth Rhoda . RHODA takes off one of her shoes and examines it . Then , smiling a little in a fashion she has always found charming , she asks : RHODA PENMARK When we move into our new house can we have a scuppernong arbor , mother ? Can we , mother ? It 's so shady , and pretty , and I love sitting in it ! p. 51 CHRISTINE PENMARK Answer my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what went on at the picnic as you think . Miss Fern has told me a great deal . So please do n't bother to make up a story for my benefit . RHODA is silent , her mind workingHow did Claude Daigle 's medal get in your drawer ? It certainly did n't get there by itself . RHODA is silentI 'm waiting for your answer . RHODA PENMARK I do n't know how the medal got there , mother . How could I ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Controlling herselfYou know . You know quite well how it got there . Did you go on the wharf at any time during the picnic ? At any time ? RHODA PENMARK After a pause Yes , mother . I  --  I went there once . CHRISTINE PENMARK Was it before or after you were bothering Claude ? RHODA PENMARK I did n't bother Claude , mother . What makes you think that ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Why did you go on the wharf ? RHODA PENMARK It was real early . When we first got there . CHRISTINE PENMARK You knew it was forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENMARK One of the big boys said there were little oysters that grew on the pilings . I wanted to see if they did . CHRISTINE PENMARK One of the guards saw you coming off the wharf . But he says it was just before lunch time . RHODA PENMARK I do n't know why he says that . He 's wrong , and I told Miss Fern he was wrong . He hollered at me to come off the wharf and I did . I went back to the lawn and that 's where I saw Claude . But I was n't bothering him . CHRISTINE PENMARK What did you say to Claude ? RHODA PENMARK I said if I did n't win the medal , I was glad he did . CHRISTINE PENMARK WearilyPlease , please , Rhoda . I know you 're an adroit liar . But I must have the truth . RHODA PENMARK But it 's all true , mother . Every word . CHRISTINE PENMARK One of the monitors saw you try to snatch the medal off Claude 's shirt . Is that true ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Mary Beth Musgrove . She told everybody she saw me . Even Leroy knows she saw me . She opens her eyes wide , and smiles as though resolving on complete candorYou see , Claude and I were playing a game we made up . He said if I could catch him in ten minutes and touch the medal with my hand  --  it was like prisoner 's base  --  he 'd let me wear the medal for an hour . How can Mary Beth say I took the medal ? I didn't. p. 53 CHRISTINE PENMARK She did n't say you took the medal . She said you grabbed at it . And that Claude ran away down the beach . Did you have the medal even then ? RHODA PENMARK No , mommy . Not then . She runs to her mother and kisses her ardently . This time CHRISTINE is the passive one CHRISTINE PENMARK How did you get the medal ? RHODA PENMARK Oh , I got it later on . CHRISTINE PENMARK How ? RHODA PENMARK Claude went back on his promise and I followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could wear the medal all day if I gave him fifty cents . CHRISTINE PENMARK Is that the truth ? RHODA PENMARK With slight contemptYes , mother . I gave him fifty cents and he let me wear the medal . CHRISTINE PENMARK Then why did n't you tell this to Miss Fern when she questioned you ? RHODA PENMARK Oh , mommy , mommy ! She whimpers a littleMiss Fern does n't like me at all ! I was afraid she 'd think bad things about me if I told her I had the medal ! CHRISTINE PENMARK You knew how much Mrs. Daigle wanted the medal , did n't you ? p. 54 RHODA PENMARK Yes , mother , I guess I did . CHRISTINE PENMARK Why did n't you give it to her ? RHODA says nothingMrs . Daigle is heartbroken over Claude 's death . It 's destroyed her . I do n't think she 'll ever recover from it . She disengages herselfDo you know what I mean ? RHODA PENMARK Yes , mother , I guess so , mother . CHRISTINE PENMARK No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was silly to want to bury the medal pinned on Claude 's coat . Claude was dead . He would n't know whether he had the medal pinned on him or not . She senses her mother 's sudden feeling of revulsion , and kisses her cheek with hungry kissesI 've got the sweetest mother . I tell everybody I 've got the sweetest mother in the world !  --  If she wants a little boy that bad , why does n't she take one out of the Orphans ' Home ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Do n't touch me ! Do n't talk to me ! We have nothing to say to each other ! RHODA PENMARK Well , okay . Okay , mother . She turns away and starts to the den CHRISTINE PENMARK Rhoda ! When we lived in Baltimore , there was an old lady , Mrs. Clara Post , who liked you very much . p. 55 RHODA PENMARK Yes . CHRISTINE PENMARK You used to go up to see her every afternoon .

One afternoon when the daughter was shopping at the supermarket , and you were alone with Mrs. Post , the old lady somehow managed to fall down the spiral backstairs and break her neck . You said she heard a kitten mewing outside and went to see about it and somehow missed her footing and fell five flights to the courtyard below . RHODA PENMARK Yes , it 's true . CHRISTINE PENMARK Then you asked the daughter for the crystal ball . She gave it to you , and it 's still hanging at the head of your bed . RHODA PENMARK Yes , mother . CHRISTINE PENMARK Did you have anything to do , anything at all , no matter how little it was , with Claude getting drowned ? RHODA PENMARK What makes you ask that , mother ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Come here , Rhoda . Look me in the eyes and tell me . I must know ! RHODA PENMARK No , mother . I did n't . CHRISTINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . They do n't want you any more . p. 56 RHODA PENMARK Okay . Okay . CHRISTINE PENMARK Crosses to telephoneI 'll call Miss Fern and ask her to come over . RHODA PENMARK She 'll think I lied to her . CHRISTINE PENMARK You did lie to her ! RHODA PENMARK But not to you , mother ! Not to you ! CHRISTINE rises and goes to the telephone . RHODA watches her with apprehension . CHRISTINE dials a number CHRISTINE PENMARK The Fern School ? Is Miss Claudia Fern there ?  --  No . No message . She hangs upShe 's not home yet . RHODA PENMARK What would you tell her , mother ? CHRISTINE PENMARK No ! It ca n't be true ! It ca n't be true ! She turns and looks at RHODA , then embraces her@@ The same apartment , late afternoon , the next day . RHODA is seated at her little table putting a jig-saw puzzle together . She works with intense concentration , trying , rejecting , considering sizes and angles . CHRISTINE comes out of the inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RHODA PENMARK Hello , Aunt Monica ! MONICA BREEDLOVE Hi , honey . RHODA PENMARK Mother ! MONICA BREEDLOVE Oh , Christine ! You said I might have Rhoda for a while . And there 's a package for you . CHRISTINE PENMARK Thank you , Monica . You 're always the bringer of gifts . She takes a rather bulky carton from MONICA MONICA BREEDLOVE This is from somebody else . It was in the package room . CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh  --  for Rhoda , from daddy  --  RHODA PENMARK Up at onceFor me ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , not yet . " In anticipation of her ninth birthday . " p. 58 RHODA PENMARK What does anticipation mean ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Looking forward to it . CHRISTINE PENMARK " Not to be opened till  --  " RHODA PENMARK Oh . It 's a long time to wait . But I will . MONICA BREEDLOVE Is n't she the perfect old-fashioned girl ? She 'll wait ! CHRISTINE PENMARK No  --  there 's more in daddy 's writing  --  " Open when you get it  --  there 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants me to open it now ! CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . All it needs is to be slit down this side with the scissors . RHODA PENMARK There 's excelsior  --  I can see it . CHRISTINE PENMARK It should be opened in the kitchen , Rhoda . RHODA PENMARK Okay . She takes the package to the kitchen MONICA BREEDLOVE Watching RHODA , waiting till she 's out of earshotI wish she were mine ! Every time I look at her I wish I had just such a little girl . CHRISTINE PENMARK She 's not wanted in the Fern School next year . p. 59 MONICA BREEDLOVE Why ? CHRISTINE PENMARK She does n't fit in , does n't play the game , she 's a poor sport . MONICA BREEDLOVE Honestly , the longer I live , the more I see , the less I 'm able to understand the tight little minds of people like the Fern girls ! The truth of the matter is , Rhoda is much too charming , too clever , too unusual for them ! She makes those others look stupid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHRISTINE PENMARK I seem to have quit . MONICA BREEDLOVE Seem to have ! Good God , if I were to quit you 'd hear the repercussions in New Orleans ! I string along with St. Paul  --  it 's better to smoke than to burn .  --  Could Rhoda stay up and have dinner with me tonight ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , she could . I 've asked Reginald Tasker over for cocktails and to talk to me about some writing I want to try . MONICA BREEDLOVE Fine ; there 's no reason why Rhoda should hear about his strychnines and belladonnas . RHODA comes to the kitchen door with a large pasteboard box in her handsRhoda , you 're to have dinner with me tonight . RHODA PENMARK I am ? May I bring my new puzzle ? p. 60 MONICA BREEDLOVE You surely may . CHRISTINE PENMARK Is that what it was ? RHODA PENMARK I think it must be the best jig-saw puzzle in the whole world . There is a tap at the door and as LEROY speaks it swings open LEROY OutsideLeroy . LEROY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a lot of excelsior . MONICA BREEDLOVE He 'll take care of it . LEROY Yes , surely , ma'am . CHRISTINE PENMARK Do n't bother to sweep the kitchen . I 'll do it . LEROY carries the garbage pail into the kitchen RHODA PENMARK It 's a map of Asia with all the animals . MONICA BREEDLOVE I have an aversion to cobras , but it 's Freudian . LEROY Emerging from the kitchenThere 's a lot of this stuff scattered around , Mis ' Penmark . MONICA BREEDLOVE Let him sweep it , dear . I shall run up and look at the simmering meat sauce . p. 61 RHODA PENMARK Oh , is it spaghetti ? MONICA BREEDLOVE It is . Approve ? RHODA PENMARK My favorite ! MONICA BREEDLOVE Come up any time . It must be nearly ready . She goes out . LEROY begins to sweep in the kitchen . RHODA puts her new puzzle on the table and examines it MESSENGER In the hall outsideMrs . Penmark ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Yes . This is her door . MONICA looks inWestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MONICA disappears , leaving a MESSENGER in her place in the doorway . He hands CHRISTINE a yellow envelope . She takes the envelope and the MESSENGER goes , closing the door . CHRISTINE opens the envelope , and reads the message with pleasureAh ! RHODA PENMARK Is it daddy ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Not your daddy this time ; mine . He 's coming here . RHODA PENMARK Grandfather ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . He 'll be here tonight .  --  He can sleep  --  I think Monica has an extra room  --  I must run up and ask her ! Be right back . She goes out . LEROY comes from the kitchen again with the box of excelsior p. 62 LEROY QuietlyThere she sits at her little table , doing her puzzle and looking cute and innocent . Looking like she would n't melt butter , she 's that cool . She can fool some people with that innocent look she can put on and put off when she wants to , but not me . Not even part way , she ca n't fool me . RHODA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns back to the puzzleShe do n't want to talk to nobody smart . She likes to talk to people she can fool , like her mama and Mrs. Breedlove and Mr. Emory . RHODA PENMARK Go empty the excelsior . You talk silly all the time . I know what you do with the excelsior . You made a bed of excelsior in the garage behind that old couch , and you sleep there where nobody can see you . LEROY I been way behind the times here-to-fore , but now I got your number , miss . I been hearing things about you that ai n't nice . I been hearing you beat up that poor little Claude in the woods , and it took all three the Fern sisters to pull you off him . I heard you run him off the wharf , he was so scared . RHODA PENMARK Picking up a pieceIF you tell lies like that you wo n't go to heaven when you die . LEROY I heard plenty . I listen to people talk . Not like you who 's gabbling all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in edgewise . That 's why I know what people are saying and you don't. p. 63 RHODA PENMARK People tell lies all the time . I think you tell them more than anybody else . LEROY I know what you done to that boy when you got him out on the wharf . You better listen to me if you want to keep out of bad trouble . RHODA PENMARK What did I do , if you know so much ? LEROY You picked up a stick and hit him with it . You hit him because he would n't give you that medal like you told him to . I thought I 'd seen some mean little girls in my time , but you 're the meanest . You want to know how I know how mean you are ? Because I 'm mean . I 'm smart and I 'm mean . And you 're smart and you 're mean , and I never get caught and you never get caught . RHODA PENMARK I know what you think . I know everything you think . Nobody believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did after you hit that boy ? You jerked the medal off his shirt . Then you rolled that sweet little boy off the wharf , among them pilings . RHODA PENMARK You do n't know anything . None of what you said is true . LEROY You know I 'm telling the God 's truth . You know I got it figured out . RHODA PENMARK You figured out something that never happened . And so it 's all lies . Take your excelsior down to the garage and put it where you can sleep on it when you 're supposed to be working . p. 64 LEROY You ai n't no dope  --  that I must say  --  and that 's why you did n't leave that stick where nobody could find it . Oh , no , you got better sense than that . You took that bloody stick and washed it off good , and then you threw it in the woods where nobody could see it . RHODA PENMARK I think you 're a very silly man . LEROY It was you was silly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't . RHODA PENMARK After a pause , putting down a pieceWhy ca n't you wash off blood ? LEROY Because you ca n't , and the police know it . You can wash and wash , but there 's always some left . Everybody knows that . I 'm going to call the , police and tell them to start looking for that stick in the woods . They got what they call " stick bloodhounds " to help them look  --  and them stick bloodhounds can find any stick there is that 's got blood on it . And when they bring in that stick you washed so clean the police 'll sprinkle that special blood powder on it , and that little boy 's blood will show up on the stick . It 'll show up a pretty blue color like a robin 's egg . RHODA PENMARK You 're scared about the police yourself ! LEROY Shhh ! p. 65 RHODA PENMARK What you say about me , it 's all about you ! They 'll get you with that powder ! LEROY hears MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish there was more excelsior . I could use it . CHRISTINE PENMARK Coming inWhat were you saying to Rhoda ? LEROY Why , Mrs. Penmark , we was just talking . She said it was a big box of excelsior . CHRISTINE PENMARK Seeing the anger on RHODA 'S face , the smirk of triumph on LEROY'SJust the same you 're not to speak to her again . If you do I 'll report you ! Is that entirely clear ? RHODA PENMARK I started it , mama . I told him it was a puzzle all about Asia , and I hardly know where anything is in Asia . CHRISTINE PENMARK Very well  --  but do n't speak to her ! LEROY Yes , ma'am . He goes CHRISTINE PENMARK Turning on the lightsYou 're really working in the dark here . I think you strain your eyes over these things . CHRISTINE wheels a small bar out of the kitchen , set up to serve drinks p. 66 RHODA PENMARK Mother , is it true that when blood has been washed off anything a policeman can still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place ? Will the place really turn blue ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Who 's been talking to you about such things ? Leroy ? RHODA PENMARK No , mommy , it was n't he . It was some men went by the gate in the park . CHRISTINE PENMARK I do n't know how they test for blood . But I could ask Reginald Tasker . Or Miss Fern ; she might know . RHODA PENMARK No  --  do n't ask her ! Mommy , mommy , mommy ! She breaks down and cries , deliberatelyNobody helps me ! Nobody believes me ! I 'm your little girl , and I 'm all alone ! CHRISTINE PENMARK It 's not a very good act , Rhoda . You may improve it enough to convince someone who does n't know you , but at present it 's easy to see through . RHODA PENMARK Wiping away tears with the back of her handMaybe I 'd better go up to Monica 's and have dinner . CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . She said any time . The doorbell ringsAnd my company is here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REGINALD TASKER EnteringGood evening . CHRISTINE PENMARK This is my daughter , Rhoda . REGINALD TASKER Hello , Rhoda . He puts out his hand . She takes it and gives him her best smileWell , is n't she a little sweetheart ! RHODA PENMARK Making her curtsyThank you . REGINALD TASKER That 's the kind of thing makes an old bachelor wish he were married . RHODA PENMARK You like little girls to curtsy ? REGINALD TASKER It 's the best thing left out of the Middle Ages ! RHODA PENMARK I 'm having dinner upstairs . REGINALD TASKER The loss is ours , all ours . CHRISTINE PENMARK You may go now , Rhoda . RHODA PENMARK Yes , mommy . She throws CHRISTINE a kiss and runs out REGINALD TASKER That 's a little ray of sunshine , that one . Is n't she ? CHRISTINE PENMARK I 've seen her stormy . REGINALD TASKER No doubt . But she 's going to make some man very happy . Just that smile . p. 68 CHRISTINE PENMARK Since I called you I 've had a wire from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a year since I 've seen him . REGINALD TASKER Bravo 's coming ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . REGINALD TASKER Now there 's a man I always wanted to meet . CHRISTINE PENMARK He may be here before long . He said perhaps for dinner . REGINALD TASKER Good . By the way , if you 're thinking of writing mystery stories Bravo was quite an authority on crime and criminals early in his career . CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , I know he was . REGINALD TASKER He could probably help you more than I could . Before he began covering wars he covered practically all the horror cases , from Leopold and Loeb on . CHRISTINE PENMARK What will it be ? REGINALD TASKER Gin and tonic ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Good . I 'll have it too .  --  You see , what I wanted to ask was a psychological question and I doubt that it was asked or answered  --  if it has been  --  till recently . She pauses , pouring into the jigger , getting out the ice p. 69 REGINALD TASKER I may not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . But the story I was thinking of writing made me wonder  --  tell me , do children ever commit murders ? Or is crime something that 's learned gradually , and grows as the criminal grows up , so that only adults do really dreadful things ? REGINALD TASKER Well , I have thought about that , and so have several authorities I 've consulted lately . Yes , children have often committed murders , and quite clever ones too . Some murderers , particularly the distinguished ones who are going to make great names for themselves , start amazingly early . CHRISTINE PENMARK In childhood ? REGINALD TASKER Oh , yes . Just like mathematicians and musicians . Poets develop later . There 's never been anything worth while in poetry written before eighteen or twenty . But Mozart showed his genius at six , Pascal was a master mathematician at twelve , and some of the great criminals were top-flight operators before they got out of short pants and pinafores . CHRISTINE PENMARK They grew up in the slums , or among criminals , and learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be father ! p. 70 REGINALD TASKER If it is I would like to stay and see him a moment  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , that 's understood ! She opens the doorDaddy ! BRAVO comes into the doorway , a man of fifty-five or sixty , handsome once , but somewhat stern and weary RICHARD BRAVO Hello , darling . I 'm early . CHRISTINE goes into his arms and they kiss , then stand looking at each other . He sets down a small bag CHRISTINE PENMARK You 're here ! You 're actually here ! RICHARD BRAVO I guess I 'm something of a truant , sweetheart , but you said you wanted to see me , and I wanted to see you , so  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'm so glad ! This is Reginald Tasker , father . RICHARD BRAVO Giving his hand to TASKERAh , one of my favorites ! REGINALD TASKER Puts you to sleep regularly ? RICHARD BRAVO Sometimes keeps me awake . You 've done some impressive research for the Classic Crime Club . REGINALD TASKER Now I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bravo . p. 71 RICHARD BRAVO That old dodo ! No , no , he 's written himself out , and talked himself out and now he 's drifting round the country , working for a second-rate news service . REGINALD TASKER You 're really looking into this off-side oil ? RICHARD BRAVO That 's what they 've got me doing . But I took off and left them , for the moment anyway . I wanted to see my long-lost daughter . He puts his arm around CHRISTINE REGINALD TASKER I 've sometimes wanted to ask you if you 've ever considered coming back into the criminology racket . There 's been nobody like you since you left . RICHARD BRAVO Well , all compliments aside , my later books did n't sell as well as the early ones  --  and the war came along . Now I write filler . REGINALD TASKER You 've written some things that wo n't be forgotten . RICHARD BRAVO Let 's hope . REGINALD TASKER And now your daughter is going to try her hand . RICHARD BRAVO At writing ? She ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with Kenneth away , and I thought I 'd try to work out a murder mystery , in the evenings . p. 72 RICHARD BRAVO To TASKERAnd you 're encouraging this competition ? REGINALD TASKER Well , I was rather stumped by her last question . She was asking whether criminal children are always the product of environment . RICHARD BRAVO Nothing difficult about that , little one . They are . REGINALD TASKER Now , I 'd have said the same , a few years ago  --  RICHARD BRAVO Look , ca n't I have some of this wicked mixture you 're lapping up ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Of course , daddy  --  I 'm sorry . Do you really think they 're always the product of environment ? RICHARD BRAVO Always . REGINALD TASKER I could n't prove you 're wrong , of course . But some doctor friends of mine assure me that we 've all been putting too much emphasis on environment and too little on heredity lately . They say there 's a type of criminal born with no capacity for remorse or guilt  --  born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among humans fifty thousand years ago  --  RICHARD BRAVO Do you believe this ? REGINALD TASKER Well , yes , I guess I do . p. 73 RICHARD BRAVO Well , I do n't . REGINALD TASKER I 've been convinced that there are people  --  only a few , and certainly very unfortunate  --  who are incapable from the beginning of acquiring a , conscience , or a moral character . Not even able to love , except physically . No feeling for right or wrong . RICHARD BRAVO I 've heard such assertions , but never found any evidence behind them . If you encounter a human without compassion or pity or morals , he grew up where these things were n't encouraged . That 's final and absolute . This stuff you 're talking is tommyrot . He sips his drink CHRISTINE PENMARK Do your doctor friends have any evidence ? REGINALD TASKER They ca n't prove it , but they think there are such people . They say there are children born into the best families , with every advantage of education and discipline  --  that never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were born blind  --  you could n't expect to teach them to see . CHRISTINE PENMARK And do they look  --  like brutes ? RICHARD BRAVO Are you sold on this ? CHRISTINE PENMARK I want to find out . REGINALD TASKER Sometimes they do . But often they present a more convincing picture of virtue than normal folks . A wax rosebud or a plastic peach can look more perfect than the real thing . They imitate humanity beautifully . p. 74 CHRISTINE PENMARK But that 's  --  horrible . REGINALD TASKER Some of them seem to have done some pretty horrible things and kept on looking innocent and sweet . RICHARD BRAVO I 'd like to examine the evidence . Not much sense discussing it till we do . REGINALD TASKER Well , this clinic I frequent came long ago to the conclusion that there are bad seeds  --  just plain bad from the beginning , and nothing can change them . CHRISTINE PENMARK And this favorite murderess of yours  --  the one you were speaking of the other day  --  is she an instance ? REGINALD TASKER Bessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she may have been , because the deaths started so early in her vicinity . Bessie earned her sobriquet of " The Destroying Angel " in early childhood . CHRISTINE PENMARK Then she began young ? REGINALD TASKER Yes . The name was n't applied to her till much later , when the whole story of her career came out , but Bessie was lethal and accurate from the beginning . One of her most famous murders involved the use of the deadly amanita , a mushroom known as " the destroying angel , " and some clever reporter transferred the term to her .  --  In fact , it was a colleague of Mr. Bravo 's , unless I 've misread something  --  p. 75 RICHARD BRAVO It may have been  --  I do n't know . CHRISTINE PENMARK How did she end ? REGINALD TASKER Well , Mr. Bravo knows more about it than I do  --  RICHARD BRAVO I 've forgotten the whole thing . Put it out of my mind . I 'm in oil now . CHRISTINE PENMARK Tell me  --  how did she end ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess , sweetheart  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , I do . RICHARD BRAVO Ca n't we change the subject ? CHRISTINE PENMARK No , darling , I want to know . What was the rest of the story , Mr. Tasker ? REGINALD TASKER There 's the mystery . By the time the authorities got really roused about her she disappeared from the Middle West  --  just seemed to vanish . She had quite a fortune by that time . The fellow that seems to know most about her maintains that she went to Australia . A similar beauty emerged in Melbourne ; her name was Beulah Demerest , so if it was the same person she did n't have to change the initials on her linen or silver . CHRISTINE PENMARK How could she  --  kill so many  --  and leave no trace ? p. 76 REGINALD TASKER To BRAVOYou wrote a famous essay listing all her methods  --  you must know it better than I do  --  RICHARD BRAVO Not at all . I 've dropped all that  --  have n't read the recent literature . CHRISTINE PENMARK Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , I 'll make it short . She made a specialty of poisons  --  studied not only drugs and toxins but the lives of those she wished to kill . It 's practically impossible to prove murder when the victim dies of rattlesnake venom in Western Colorado . Too many diamondbacks about . And tetanus can be picked up in any barnyard . She made use of such things .  --  It all came to a sudden end  --  she was indicted again and took off for parts unknown  --  leaving no  --  but was n't there a child , a little girl ? RICHARD BRAVO Never heard of one . That must be a recent addition to the myth . CHRISTINE PENMARK I wanted to ask one more question . Was she ever found out here ? REGINALD TASKER Not in this country . Three juries looked at that lovely dewy face and heard that melting cultured voice and said , " She could n't have done it . " CHRISTINE PENMARK She was n't convicted ? p. 77 REGINALD TASKER " Not guilty . " Three times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformed children , born without pity ? REGINALD TASKER Personally , I guess I do . CHRISTINE PENMARK Did she have an enchanting smile ? REGINALD TASKER Dazzling , by all accounts . CHRISTINE PENMARK She was doomed ? REGINALD TASKER Absolutely . Doomed to commit murder after murder till somehow or other she was found out . CHRISTINE PENMARK She 'd have been better off if she 'd died young . REGINALD TASKER And society would . And yet sometimes I wonder whether these malignant brutes may not be the mutation that survives on this planet in this age . This age of technology and murder-for-empire . Maybe the softies will have to go , and the snake-hearted will inherit the earth . RICHARD BRAVO I 'm betting on the democracies . REGINALD TASKER And so am I. But we 're living in an age of murder . In all history there have never been so many people murdered as in our century . Add up all the murders from the beginning of history to 1900 , and then add the murders after 1900 , and our century wins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I should take my leave , for I meant not to bother you and I 've been lecturing. p. 78 RICHARD BRAVO You 've got a highly questionable theory there  --  about heredity . REGINALD TASKER I 'd like to go into that with you when there 's more time . RICHARD BRAVO Let 's do that next time I 'm in town . REGINALD TASKER Right . And now I 'll say good evening , Mrs. Penmark  --  I 'm afraid the pleasure 's been all mine . CHRISTINE PENMARK Not at all . I 'll call you early in the week . REGINALD TASKER I 'm always about . To BRAVOGood-night , sir . RICHARD BRAVO Good-night , Mr. Tasker . CHRISTINE PENMARK Good-night . TASKER goes out RICHARD BRAVO Are you really planning to write something ? CHRISTINE PENMARK I was just asking questions . You saw Kenneth in Washington ? RICHARD BRAVO Yes . He 's looking well . As well as possible when a fellow 's hot , sticky , tired , and , most of all , lonesome . CHRISTINE PENMARK We 'd counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden change of orders . RICHARD BRAVO Am I looking too close , or is there something heavy on your mind ? p. 79 CHRISTINE PENMARK Does something show in my face ? RICHARD BRAVO Everything shows in your face . It always did . CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'm not sure I 'm worried about anything  --  now that you 're here . I always felt so safe and comfortable when you were in the room . And you have the same effect now . RICHARD BRAVO To tell you the truth you did a magic for me . I 'd always wanted a little girl and you were everything lovely a little girl could be for her old dad . But , Christine , what did you want to ask me  --  that night you phoned ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Let me think a minute .  --  Would you have another drink ? RICHARD BRAVO Yes , I guess I will . He looks at the barLet me fix something . Will you have more gin and tonic ? He goes to the bar CHRISTINE PENMARK No , thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , whatever it is . CHRISTINE PENMARK My landlady here is  --  is a sort of amateur psychiatrist  --  a devotee of Freud , constantly analyzing . RICHARD BRAVO I know the sort . p. 80 CHRISTINE PENMARK Her name is Breedlove . You 'll meet her , because she 's offered a wonderful room for you to stay in while you 're here . Rhoda 's having dinner with her tonight . RICHARD BRAVO You were going to come out with something . CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . Well , what I was going to ask reminded me of her . I confessed to her the other day that I had always worried about being an adopted child  --  had always been afraid that mommy was n't really my mother and the daddy I love so much was n't really my daddy . RICHARD BRAVO What did she say ? CHRISTINE PENMARK She said it was one of the commonest fantasies of childhood . Everybody has it . She had it herself . RICHARD BRAVO It certainly is common . CHRISTINE PENMARK But that does n't help me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old fear that you 're not really mine . RICHARD BRAVO Has something made you think of this lately ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . RICHARD BRAVO What is it ? CHRISTINE PENMARK My little girl , Rhoda . RICHARD BRAVO What about her ? p. 81 CHRISTINE PENMARK She terrifies me . I 'm afraid for her . I 'm afraid of what she may have inherited from me . RICHARD BRAVO What could she have inherited ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Father  --  daddy  --  whose child am I ? RICHARD BRAVO Mine . CHRISTINE PENMARK Daddy , dear , do n't lie to me . It 's gone beyond where that will help . I 've told you about a dream I have  --  and I 'm not sure it 's all a dream . Whose child am I ? Are you my father ? BRAVO is silentThis is a strange question to greet you with after being so long away from you  --  but I  --  I have to ask it . And for Rhoda 's sake  --  and mine  --  you must tell me . RICHARD BRAVO What has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm afraid . RICHARD BRAVO It can not be inherited . It can not . He draws a deep breath , then takes a step and staggers slightly , putting out a hand for support CHRISTINE PENMARK Father , you 're not well ! She goes to him . He sinks into a chair RICHARD BRAVO I 'm all right , just get me a glass of water . She gets a glass from the kitchenPerfectly well . A trace of fibrillation once in a while , quite normal at my age . Thank you . And with fibrillation there 's a slight dizziness , also normal . I 'm all right now . p. 82 CHRISTINE PENMARK I wo n't ask any more questions . I 'm sorry . RICHARD BRAVO I think that 's better . Let 's just close the book . CHRISTINE PENMARK After a pauseOnly I have the answer now . RICHARD BRAVO The answer ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . RICHARD BRAVO I 've been a very fortunate man , Christine . I could tell you a long history of jobs that came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends who showed up to pay old debts just when I had to have the money . At every main turning-point in my life some good fairy has seemed to intervene to flip things my way . And the biggest piece of luck I ever had  --  the luck that saved my reason and kept me going  --  was a little girl named Christine . You were the only child I ever had . My life was futile and barren before you came , but you were magic for me , as I said , and you made life bearable . I kept on  --  because of you . CHRISTINE PENMARK You do n't have to say any more . RICHARD BRAVO I do n't , do I ? CHRISTINE PENMARK You found me somewhere . RICHARD BRAVO Yes . In a very strange place  --  in a strange way . p. 83 CHRISTINE PENMARK I know the place . RICHARD BRAVO I do n't think you could . You were less than two years old . CHRISTINE PENMARK I either remember it or I dreamed it . RICHARD BRAVO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bedroom in a farmhouse in a countryside where there are orchards . I sleep in the room with my brother , who is older than I  --  and my  --  is it my mother ?  --  comes to take care of him . She is a graceful , lovely woman , like an angel . I suppose my brother must have died , for afterward I 'm alone in the room . One night I awake feeling terrified and for some reason I ca n't stay in that house . It 's moonlight and I somehow get out the window , drop to the grass below and hide myself in the tall weeds beyond the first orchard . I do n't recall much more except that toward morning I 'm thirsty and keep eating the yellow pippins that fall from the tree  --  and when the first light comes up on the clouds I can hear my mother calling my name . I hide in the weeds and do n't answer . Is this a dream ? Is it only a dream ? RICHARD BRAVO What name did she call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it  --  could it be Ingold ? p. 84 RICHARD BRAVO You remember that name ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , it comes back to me . " Ingold ! Ingold Denker , " she was calling . Denker ? You 've concealed something from me all these years , have n't you , daddy ? I came out of that terrible house-hold ! You found me there ! RICHARD BRAVO The neighbors found you after your mother vanished . Where she went I never knew , nor did they , but she had quite a fortune by that time , and something had panicked her  --  so she quickly got away , leaving one child , an astonishingly sweet and beautiful little thing with the most enchanting smile I 've ever seen . I was covering the case for a Chicago paper , and I wired my wife to join me . We could n't resist you . CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , daddy , daddy ! Oh , God help me ! Why did n't you leave me there ? Why did n't I die in the orchard and end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found you and saved you . Would you rather have stayed with them ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , no , you know I would n't . You 've been a wonderful father ! But  --  that place  --  and that evil woman  --  my mother  --  ! RICHARD BRAVO There are places and events in every man 's life he 'd rather not remember . Do n't let it hurt you now . It 's past and does n't touch you . p. 85 CHRISTINE PENMARK I wish I had died then ! I wish it ! I wish it ! RICHARD BRAVO It has n't mattered where you came from ! You 've been sound and sweet and loving ! You 've given me more than I ever gave or could ever repay ! If you 'd been my own I could n't have hoped for more ! You knew nothing but love and kindness and you 've given love and kindness and sweetness all your life ! Kenneth loves you , and you 've made him happy . And Rhoda 's a perfect , sweet , sound little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? RICHARD BRAVO What has she done ? CHRISTINE PENMARK She 's  --  it 's as if she were born blind ! RICHARD BRAVO It can not happen ! It does not happen ! The doorbell chimes and MONICA comes in MONICA BREEDLOVE Excuse me , please , but Rhoda has eaten her dinner , tired of her puzzle and now she wants a book . CHRISTINE PENMARK We have n't even started yet . MONICA BREEDLOVE And I have n't met Mr. Bravo . She puts out her handI 'm Mrs. Breedlove . The oversized analyst who 's going to put you up , and promises not to annoy you . p. 86 RICHARD BRAVO You know what newspaper men are like  --  crusty , bitter , irascible . If you can put up with me you 're a saint . RHODA enters RHODA PENMARK Granddaddy ! RICHARD BRAVO Rhoda ! He picks her up and puts her down MONICA BREEDLOVE Is n't she perfection ? RHODA PENMARK Next to daddy , you lift me up best ! Why do you look at me ? RICHARD BRAVO I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bravo , these Penmarks are the most enchanting neighbors I 've ever had . Now I 'll want Rhoda for dinner every night . Tell me , did n't you write the Fingerprint Series ? RICHARD BRAVO I 'm afraid I was very guilty of that about twenty years ago . MONICA BREEDLOVE I read the first volume to pieces , and wept over it till the parts I loved most were illegible  --  and then bought another ! RICHARD BRAVO I 've finally met my public . MONICA BREEDLOVE I do n't disappoint you ? Anyway I 'm large . RICHARD BRAVO I like the way you read books to pieces . It 's good for royalties. p. 87 CHRISTINE PENMARK It 's time to get dinner for us . RICHARD BRAVO Maybe I should find my room and get ready for the evening . MONICA BREEDLOVE I 'll take you up if you 'd like to go now . RICHARD BRAVO If you 'll be so kind . MONICA BREEDLOVE It 's the floor above . Be back , Christine . BRAVO picks up his small bag and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get dinner . RHODA goes to the inner hall , and then comes out furtively , carrying a newspaper package . CHRISTINE emerges from the kitchen CHRISTINE PENMARK What are you doing ? RHODA PENMARK Nothing . CHRISTINE PENMARK Is that for the incinerator ? RHODA PENMARK Yes . CHRISTINE PENMARK What is it ? RHODA PENMARK Some things you told me to throw away . CHRISTINE PENMARK Let me see what 's in the package . RHODA PENMARK No . CHRISTINE PENMARK Let me see it ! She tries to take the bundle from a sullen RHODA . RHODA suddenly snatches it back and tries to run . CHRISTINE holds on determinedly , and RHODA begins to bite and kick like a little animal . The package tears , revealing RHODA 'S shoes . CHRISTINE wrests the bundle away , and pushes RHODA violently from her , so that she falls into a chair , staring at her mother with cold , fixed hatredYou hit him with one of the shoes , did n't you ? Tell me ! Tell me the truth ! You hit him with those shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead and hands ! Answer me ! Answer me ! p. 88 RHODA PENMARK I hit him with the shoes ! I had to hit him with the shoes , mother ! What else could I do ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Do you know that you murdered him ? RHODA PENMARK It was his fault ! If he 'd given me the medal like I told him to I would n't have hit him ! She begins to cry , pressing her forehead against table CHRISTINE PENMARK Tell me what happened . I want the truth this time . Start from the beginning and tell me how it happened . I know you killed him , so there 's no sense in lying again . RHODA PENMARK Throwing herself into her mother 's arms I ca n't , mother ! I ca n't tell you ! CHRISTINE PENMARK Shaking RHODAI 'm waiting for your answer ! Tell me . I must know now ! RHODA PENMARK He would n't give me the medal like I told him to , that 's all . So then he ran away from me and hid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him I 'd hit him with my shoe if he did n't give me the medal . He shook his head and said , " No , " so I hit him the first time and then he took off the medal and gave it to me . CHRISTINE PENMARK What happened then ? p. 89 RHODA PENMARK Well , he tried to run away , so I hit him with the shoe again . He kept crying and making a noise , and I was afraid somebody would hear him . So I kept on hitting him , mother . I hit him harder this time , and he fell in the water . CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , my God , my God ! What are we going to do , what are we going to do ? RHODA PENMARK CoquettishlyOh , I 've got the prettiest mother ! I 've got the nicest mother ! That 's what I tell everybody ! I say , " I 've got the sweetest  --  " CHRISTINE PENMARK How did the bruises get on the back of his hands ? RHODA PENMARK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fell in the water . I would n't have hit him any more only he kept saying he was going to tell on me . Mother , mother , please say you wo n't let them hurt me ! Please ! CHRISTINE PENMARK Putting her arms around RHODANobody will hurt you . I do n't know what must be done now , but I promise you nobody will hurt you . RHODA PENMARK I want to play the way we used to , mommy . Will you play with me ? If I give you a basket of kisses what will you give me ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Please , please . p. 90 RHODA PENMARK Ca n't you give me the answer , mother ? If I give you a basket of kisses  --  CHRISTINE PENMARK Rhoda , go into your room and read . I must think what to do .  --  You must promise you wo n't tell anyone else what you 've told me . Do you understand ? RHODA PENMARK With contemptWhy would I tell and get killed ? CHRISTINE PENMARK What happened to old Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't matter now . RHODA PENMARK There was ice on the steps  --  and I slipped and fell against her , and  --  and that was all . CHRISTINE PENMARK That was all ? RHODA PENMARK No . I slipped on purpose . CHRISTINE PENMARK Take the shoes and put them in the incinerator ! Hurry ! Hurry , Rhoda ! Put them in the incinerator ! Bum them quickly ! RHODA takes the bundle RHODA PENMARK What will you do with the medal , mother ? CHRISTINE PENMARK I must think of something to do . RHODA PENMARK You wo n't give it to Miss Fern ? CHRISTINE PENMARK No , I wo n't give it to Miss Fern . RHODA smiles and goes toward the door CURTAIN p. 91 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 After breakfast in the apartment , the next morning . At rise the stage is empty and the phone ringing . LEROY enters the front door . LEROY Leroy . He looks at phone , starts toward kitchen and decides to answer phone . Goes back and takes it off the hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the phone rings again . RHODA enters from the kitchenYou better answer that phone . RHODA PENMARK At the phone Hello  --  no , Mr. Bravo is n't here . Yes , I could write down a number .  --  Yes , sir .  --  I 'll tell him . Goodbye . To LEROYI found out about one lie that you told . There 's no such thing as a " stick bloodhound . " LEROY I 'm not supposed to talk to little Miss Goody-goody . RHODA PENMARK Then do n't . LEROY Where 's your mother ? RHODA PENMARK Upstairs . LEROY For your own sake , though , I 'll tell you this much . There may not be any stick bloodhounds , but there 's a stick . And you better find that stick before they do , because it 'll turn blue and then they 'll fry you in the electric chair . p. 92 RHODA PENMARK There was n't any stick any more than there were stick blood-hounds . LEROY You know the noise the electric chair makes ? It goes z  --  z  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon does when your mother 's frying it . RHODA PENMARK Go empty the garbage . They do n't put little girls in the electric chair . LEROY They do n't ? They got a little blue chair for boys and a little pink one for girls . I just remembered something . Just the morning of the picnic I wiped off your shoes with the cleats on ' em . You used to go tap-tap-tap on the walk . How come you do n't wear ' em any more ? RHODA PENMARK You 're silly . I never had a pair of shoes like that . LEROY They used to go tap-tap when you walked and I did n't like it . I spilled water on ' em and I wiped ' em off . RHODA PENMARK They hurt my feet and I gave them away . LEROY You know one thing ? You did n't hit that boy with no stick . You hit him with them shoes . Ai n't I right this time ? RHODA PENMARK You 're silly . LEROY You think I 'm silly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to make you say " No , it was n't no stick . It was my shoes . " Because I knew what it was . p. 93 RHODA PENMARK You lie all the time . All the time . LEROY How come I 've got those shoes then ? RHODA PENMARK Where did you get them ? LEROY I came in and got them right out of your apartment . RHODA PENMARK Looking at bookIt 's just more lies . I burned those shoes . I put them down the incinerator and burned them . Nobody 's got them . LEROY After a pause I do n't say that was n't smart . That was .  --  Only suppose I heard something coming rattling down the incinerator and I says to myself , " It sounds to me like a pair of shoes with cleats . " Oh , I 'm not saying you did n't burn ' em a little , but you did n't burn ' em all up like you wanted to . RHODA PENMARK Waits with a new frightening stillness and intensityYes ?  --  LEROY Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silly one . I 'm in the basement working , and I hear them shoes come rattling down the pipe . I open the door quick and there they is on top of the coals only smoking the least little bit . I grab them out . Oh , they 're scorched some , but there 's plenty left to turn blue and show where the blood was . There 's plenty left to put you in the electric chair ! He laughs a foolish little laugh of triumph p. 94 RHODA PENMARK CalmlyGive me those shoes back . LEROY Oh , no . I got them shoes hid where nobody but me can find them . RHODA PENMARK You 'd better give me those shoes . They 're mine . Give them back to me . LEROY I 'm not giving them shoes back to nobody , see ? RHODA PENMARK With cold furyYou 'd better give them back to me , Leroy . LEROY LaughingI 'm keeping them shoes until  --  His laughter dies under her fixed , cold stare . He begins to be afraid of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had any shoes except mine ? RHODA PENMARK You did . You get them and give them back . LEROY Now , listen , Rhoda , I was just fooling and teasing you . I have n't got any shoes . I 've got work to do . He starts toward front door . RHODA quickly moves up to door and blocks his way RHODA PENMARK Give me back my shoes . LEROY I have n't got nobody 's shoes . Do n't you know when anybody 's teasing you ? p. 95 RHODA PENMARK Give them back ! LEROY Go and practice your piano lesson ! I have n't got ' em , I keep telling you . RHODA PENMARK Will you bring them back ! LEROY I was just fooling at first , but now I really believe you killed that little boy . I really believe you did kill him with your shoes . RHODA PENMARK You 've got them hid , but you 'd better get them and bring them back here ! Right here to me ! LEROY Quit talking loud . There 's someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leroy saying to you ? RHODA PENMARK Nothing . CHRISTINE PENMARK I heard you say , " Bring them back here ! " RHODA PENMARK He said he had my shoes . LEROY I got nobody 's shoes but my own . There 's a number for Mr. Bravo to call . CHRISTINE PENMARK You may go , Leroy . LEROY Yes , ma'am . He exits CHRISTINE PENMARK Daddy , there is a message for you . p. 96 RICHARD BRAVO EnteringThank you , sweetheart .

He puts his arms around CHRISTINEYou are the bright thing in my life , Christine . It was you I lived for . You I loved . No matter what happens I want you to remember that . Do n't worry . It will come out well . p. 97 CHRISTINE PENMARK Come back soon . RICHARD BRAVO I will , sweetheart . He kisses CHRISTINE brieflyMy bag 's upstairs . Do n't come along . It 'll be quicker . He goes out MONICA BREEDLOVE What a trouper ! There is a sound of ice cream bellsAh , the ice cream man ! RHODA PENMARK Mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take the money from my purse . RHODA runs into the kitchen , then , coming out , stops to pick up matches as she passes the stoveIt is hot today . MONICA BREEDLOVE Yes , the streets seem deserted . CHRISTINE PENMARK Rhoda , what have you got those for ? RHODA PENMARK I guess I just was n't thinking . CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'll take them , please . She takes the matches and goes into the kitchen . RHODA picks up another box and runs out . CHRISTINE re-enters MONICA BREEDLOVE You wo n't mind too much if I 'm nosey and ridiculous , Christine . You have n't been yourself lately . It 's as if something 's dragging you down . p. 98 CHRISTINE PENMARK Oh , dear . Do I seem that way to others ? MONICA BREEDLOVE You mean you feel it ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes .

I have an awfully good combination , and I 'll bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must really forgive me . Have you and Kenneth come to a parting of the ways ? Is his secretary more to him than an expert on politics ? Does she make a nest for him among the office buildings ? CHRISTINE PENMARK It 's nothing like that , Monica . I wish I were as sure of other things as I am of Kenneth . MONICA BREEDLOVE Then do you suspect some disease  --  something like cancer , for example ? If you do , we must face it and do everything that can be done . And a lot can be . CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'm perfectly healthy as far as I know . MONICA BREEDLOVE Do you sleep enough ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Well , no . Not always . MONICA BREEDLOVE You must have some sleeping pills . That much we can do . And now I wo n't bully you any more , Christine . I 'm only going to say that I love you truly and deeply , my dear , as though you were my own ; in fact Emory feels the same way about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you know it already . CHRISTINE puts her head down on the table and sobsTell me what it is , dear . You can trust me . CHRISTINE gets up blindly , puts her arms around MONICA , and weeps without restraintDear , dear Christine . You 'll feel better now . Perhaps you can get some sleep . The doorbell rings , and CHRISTINE stirs herself slowly to answer it p. 99 MONICA BREEDLOVE Damn , I 'll get rid of whatever  --  She goes to the door and opens it . MRS . DAIGLE stands in the doorway MRS . DAIGLE Well , Mrs. Breedlove . Hi . You do n't want me here , and I do n't want to be here , but I ca n't stay away , so I got a little drunk and came over . Excuse it , please . MONICA BREEDLOVE You 're very welcome . But the words come hard MRS . DAIGLE Like a skunk , I know . Mrs. Breedlove knows everybody . Knows even me . CHRISTINE PENMARK How are you , Mrs. Daigle ? MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I just want to talk to your little girl . She was one of the last to see my Claude alive . CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , I know . MRS . DAIGLE Where do you keep the perfect little lady that was the last to see Claude ? I thought I 'd just hold her in my arms and we 'd have a nice talk and maybe she 'd remember something . Any little thing . CHRISTINE PENMARK She 's out playing . MRS . DAIGLE I 'm just unfortunate , that 's all . Drunk and unfortunate . Only she was right outside when I came by , ladies and gentlemen . p. 100 CHRISTINE PENMARK Going to the windowShe is n't there now . I do n't see her . But she could n't , for her life , Call RHODA MRS . DAIGLE She 's a perfect little lady , never gives any trouble , that 's what I heard . Have you got anything to drink in the house ? Anything at all . I 'm not the fussy type . I prefer bourbon and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels out the barOh , ai n't we swank ? Really Plaza and Astor ! MRS . DAIGLE pours herself a straight drink and downs it at a gulp , then takes a taste of waterWhat I came here for was to have a little talk with Rhoda , because she knows something . I 've called Miss Fern on the telephone a dozen times , but she just gives me the brush-off . She sits rather clumsilyShe knows something , all right . CHRISTINE PENMARK Are you comfortable there ? MRS . DAIGLE I 'm not intoxicated in the slightest degree . Kindly do n't talk down to me , Mrs. Penmark . I 've been through enough , without that . The door opens and RHODA enters , delicately eating her popsicle RHODA PENMARK I brought back change , mother . p. 101 CHRISTINE PENMARK Very well . Mrs. Daigle wants to see you . MRS . DAIGLE So this is your little girl ? Claude spoke of you so often , and in such high terms . You were one of his dearest friends , I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you 're Rhoda . RHODA PENMARK Yes . MRS . DAIGLE Come let me look at you , Rhoda . Now how about giving your Aunt Hortense a big kiss ? RHODA gives her popsicle to MONICA and goes dutifully to be kissedYou were with Claude when he had his accident , were n't you dear ? You 're the little girl who was so sure she was going to win the penmanship medal , and worked so hard . But you did n't win it after all , did you , darling ? Claude won the medal , did n't he ? Now tell me this : would you say he won it fair and square or he cheated ? These things are so important to me now he 's dead . Would you say it was fair Claude had the medal ? Because if it was fair why did you go after him for it ? RHODA PENMARK I want my popsicle . MONICA BREEDLOVE Rhoda , if you 're going shopping with me , you 'll have to come now . Mr. Pageson is going to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONICA BREEDLOVE We 're a little late as it is . Bring your popsicle , Rhoda . You can wash upstairs . MONICA disengages RHODA from MRS . DAIGLE and ushers her out of the room p. 102 MRS . DAIGLE Well , I must say ! CHRISTINE PENMARK They do have an appointment . MRS . DAIGLE I 'm sure they do , practically sure . Of course , I did n't know Rhoda had all these social obligations . I thought she was like any little girl that stayed home and minded her mother , and did n't go traipsing all over town with important appointments . I 'm sorry I interfered with Rhoda 's social life . I 'm sorry , Christine , and I offer my deepest apologies . I 'll apologize to Rhoda too when I can have an interview with her . CHRISTINE PENMARK You have n't interfered at all . The telephone rings . CHRISTINA answers it MRS . DAIGLE I was n't going to contaminate Rhoda in the slightest degree , I assure you . CHRISTINE PENMARK On the phone Hello . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . She hangs up MRS . DAIGLE Did you tell him I was drinking and making a spectacle of myself ? Did you tell him to call the patrol wagon ? CHRISTINE PENMARK You heard what I said . I said only that you were here . Your husband said he was in the drugstore on the corner . p. 103 MRS . DAIGLE I was just going to hold her in my arms and ask her a few simple questions . CHRISTINE PENMARK Perhaps another time would be better . MRS . DAIGLE You think because I 'm lit , but I 'm not lit in the slightest degree , I assure you . But Rhoda knows more than she 's told anybody , if you 'll pardon me for being presumptuous . I talked to that guard , remmber . It was a long interesting conversation , and he said he saw Rhoda on the wharf just before Claude was found among the pilings . She knows something she has n't told , all right . I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You may fool some with that mealy mouth , but you look like " Ned in the primer " to me . CHRISTINE PENMARK Then perhaps you 'd better not come here again . MRS . DAIGLE I would n't come here again for a million dollars laid out in a line ! I would n't have come this time if I 'd known about Rhoda 's social obligations . She pours herself another drinkI wo n't wait for Mr. Daigle . I 'll go home by myself . I know where I 'm not wanted , and I 'm not wanted in a place where people have all these social obligations , if you get what I mean . You 're looking sort of sick and sloppy . Come over to my house and I 'll give you a free beauty treatment if you 're pressed for ready cash . It wo n't cost you a nickel . The doorbell rings and CHRISTINE opens the door . MR . DAIGLE is there p. 104 MR . DAIGLE Thank you , Mrs. Penmark . Come , Hortense , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God , oh , my God , it 's time to go home ! She embraces CHRISTINE at the door , resting her head on CHRISTINE 'S shoulderChristine , you know something ! You know something , and you wo n't tell me ! The DAIGLES go out CHRISTINE stands for a moment , thinking , then goes to the phone and dials the operator CHRISTINE PENMARK Into the phoneOperator , I want to call Washington , D.C. She covers the speakerKenneth , darling , Kenneth , my dear love , what can I say to you ? That our daughter is a  --  She speaks into the phoneNever mind , then . No , cancel it . She hangs up . The door opens and MONICA comes in , looks quickly around MONICA BREEDLOVE Good , she 's gone . Sweet , I know I should n't take things into my all too capable hands , but I could n't let her paw Rhoda any longer . CHRISTINE PENMARK Mr. Daigle came for her . MONICA BREEDLOVE And I fear I 've loosened discipline just a little . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENMARK Did she want a second ? That 's most unusual . MONICA BREEDLOVE She seemed quite eager . And since she 's not one of these fat and self-indulgent little blobs I doubt that it can do any harm .  --  By the way , here are the vitamins and the sleep-capsules , both plainly marked . CHRISTINE PENMARK Thank you , Monica . I 'll keep them separate . MONICA BREEDLOVE Emory called while I was upstairs . He 's coming by with Reggie Tasker to store some fishing equipment they bought this morning , so I 'll get lunch for them . Would n't you like to run up and eat with us  --  you and Rhoda both ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Monica  --  I 'd  --  I 'd rather not , really . MONICA BREEDLOVE You poor girl , I do bully you , and I promised not to ! A VOICE : Off-stageFire ! Fire !

He fell just before he got to the pond ! He 's lying still ! She slips to her knees , half-fainting MONICA BREEDLOVE Trying to draw CHRISTINE from the windowWhatever can be done will be done .

EMORY and TASKER come in , coats off and somewhat disarranged from a sudden encounter with fire-fighting EMORY WAGES We thought you 'd be here .

Could there be any worse than that ? REGINALD TASKER I guess you did see the worst of it , Mrs. Penmark .

A siren is heard approaching MONICA BREEDLOVE You 'd better leave me alone with Christine for a minute . REGINALD TASKER That will be the ambulance . EMORY WAGES We can take care of that .

RHODA is on the couch , in pajamas , ready for bed . CHRISTINE is reading to her . CHRISTINE PENMARK " Polly put one toe out from under the covers to find out how cold it was , and it was nipping cold . She remembered why she had wanted to wake up , and got out of bed very softly , shivering and pulling on her dress and her stockings . She had never seen a Christmas tree decorated and lighted the way they are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hard times . She had promised herself that she would see one . " CHRISTINE pauses and looks at RHODAYou have some new vitamins to take tonight . RHODA PENMARK New ones ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . RHODA PENMARK Are those the vitamins ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . RHODA PENMARK May I see them please ? CHRISTINE gives RHODA the bottle CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes , of course . They 're some that Monica sent down for us . RHODA PENMARK Okay , mommy . I think Monica likes me. p. 112 CHRISTINE PENMARK I 'm sure she does . RHODA PENMARK Swallowing pills is just a trick . CHRISTINE PENMARK You 're very good at it . RHODA PENMARK Do you love me , mommy ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . RHODA PENMARK Mommy , do you know about Leroy ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . RHODA PENMARK You told me to put my shoes in the incinerator , did n't you ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Yes . RHODA PENMARK Did you do something with the medal ? CHRISTINE PENMARK I drove out to Benedict today to see Miss Fern . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and dropped the medal in the deep water there . RHODA PENMARK Mommy , Leroy had my shoes , and he said he was going to give them to the police and then tell them about me  --  and they 'd put me in the electric chair .

Giving her a number of pills p. 113 RHODA PENMARK So many ? CHRISTINE PENMARK They 're a new kind . I 'm to take them , too . RHODA PENMARK Taking the pillsI like apricot juice . It does n't even need ice . Mommy , I took another box of matches , and I lit the excelsior and I locked the door . But it was n't my fault , mommy . It was Leroy 's fault . He should n't have said he 'd tell the police about me and give them my shoes . CHRISTINE PENMARK I know . RHODA PENMARK There . That 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENMARK No , dear , I wo n't let them hurt you . She leans over and kisses RHODAGood night . RHODA PENMARK Good night , mommy . Now will you read to me ? CHRISTINE PENMARK Reading " When Polly was all dressed she found her shawl and crept very quietly out of the room and out the front door . The door creaked , and she waited and listened , but nobody woke up . She closed the door carefully and looked at the bright moon and the shining , cold snow . The Carters must have a tree . They lived two blocks away , and if they left the curtains open you could look in and see it . If only there were n't any dogs . Polly walked carefully on the hard snow on the walk , keeping the warm shawl close around her . It was further than she remembered to the Carters ' house , but she could see that there were lights in the windows . She came near it , only making a little creaking noise on the snow , and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared go near . Then she gathered all her courage and walked across the yard , her shoes sinking through the crust . The Christmas tree was right in the front window , and the lights were on in the house , so she could see the fruits and bells and strings of popcorn and candy  --  and the silver star at the top . " CHRISTINE pauses and looks at RHODA . She makes no sign , and her breathing is deep and regular . CHRISTINE lays down the bookRhoda , dear . Rhoda , dear  --  you are mine , and I carried you , and I ca n't let them hurt you . I ca n't let them take you away and shut you up . They 'd put you in some kind of institution . Nobody can save you from that unless I save you . So sleep well , and dream well , my only child , and the one I love . I shall sleep , too . She gathers RHODA up in her arms gently , and carries her into the bedroom . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spice cabinet high on the wall , takes out a bunch of keys and goes to the den . There is a shot and the lights go out p. 114 CURTAIN p. 115 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 Morning , a few days later . The sun is shining in at the window and MONICA enters from the kitchen with a coffee tray . She sets it down and turns toward the kitchen . EMORY , TASKER , and KENNETH come in from the outer hall . MONICA BREEDLOVE I 've made coffee if anybody wants it . EMORY WAGES That 's a thought . REGINALD TASKER I 'm in favor . MONICA BREEDLOVE Coming from the kitchen with a plate of sandwichesKenneth ? Coffee ? COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK No , thanks , Monica . He goes to the window , looks outNow I must face living without her . Somehow I could almost believe she was still with me till they lowered that coffin into the earth  --  and I knew I 'd never see her face again . Now the earth is empty , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling pretty much the same way . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK And why did she do it ? Why , in God 's name , did she do such a thing ? She was n't unhappy when I left ! Monica , she was closer to you than anyone else lately ; did she say anything  --  that ' was any kind of a reason ? p. 116 MONICA BREEDLOVE I 've gone over and over everything she said , till I 'm almost distracted  --  and it just does n't fit any pattern ! And I 've talked to everybody who knew her  --  and they 're just incredulous and shocked . There seems to be no reason at all ! COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK There was a reason . Christine did n't do things without a reason .  --  Her father died suddenly , you said ? REGINALD TASKER He 'd had a series of attacks , and the news of Christine 's death seems to have been too much for his heart . EMORY WAGES She had some worry or other and I think it was connected with her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's death and about the death of Leroy . MONICA BREEDLOVE She was hysterical at the time of the fire , but that was understandable . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK To MONICAWhen it happened how did you find her ? Did you hear the shot ? MONICA BREEDLOVE Yes  --  we heard it  --  and ran down . She 'd shot herself and given Rhoda a deadly dose of sleeping pills . She had obviously planned that they should die together . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Could she  --  could Christine have been insane ? p. 117 REGINALD TASKER No . We can rule that out . I talked with her not long ago . She shuddered somewhat  --  at my murder cases  --  but her comments were completely level-headed . EMORY WAGES No , Christine was n't crazy . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK I do n't know how I 'll live . I do n't know that I will . EMORY WAGES I guess nothing helps . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Nothing .  --  I do n't think it 's much good without Christine . The army  --  and promotion  --  and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not any of that . EMORY WAGES She was a wonderful girl . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK And she left me  --  crept away into the earth  --  and I do n't know why ! His voice breaks , and he chokes down an sob , then another and anotherI 'm sorry . MONICA BREEDLOVE You cry if you feel like it . She was worth it . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK She did n't want to live . The piano in the den is heard playing " Au Clair de la Lune " MONICA BREEDLOVE Kenneth , you have a lot to be grateful for . If we had n't heard the shot you 'd have lost Rhoda too . She goes to den , opens door and callsRhoda . RHODA enters p. 118 RHODA PENMARK Did you like it , daddy ? I played it for you . COLONEL KENNETH PENMARK Oh , Rhoda , my Rhoda , there 's a little of Christine left ! It 's in your smile ! RHODA PENMARK I love you , daddy ! What will you give me for a basket of kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks at RHODAOh , my darling  --  I 'll give you a basket of hugs !
