In the urgency of reporting to you the exciting results of the European Contract Bridge Championship that ended in another victory for Italy at Oslo last month , much of the color of that tournament had to be left out of my story . // With 15 nations competing , a European Championship is a kind of Tower of Babel scene in reverse . When I walked into the playing room before the game started my ears were buffeted with a pandemonium of tongues . Then play began , and suddenly all the speaking was in one language  --  English . Although both French and German are familiar to more of the nations taking part , English is the official language of the tournament , and must be used by all the contestants for their bids and the calling of the cards . // The accents were often charming , sometimes weird . Obviously , many of the players did not know a word of English beyond such terms as double , pass , no trump and the names of suits and cards . So , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a re-enacting of the uproar and chaos that first took place at the scene of Babel 's soaring tower . // However , the language of the cards is universal . I found further evidence of this when our lavish Norse hosts presented each player who attended the tourney with a copy of a beautiful 116-page souvenir journal . Except for a brief message of greeting , this journal was written entirely in Norwegian  --  a tongue in which , I confess , I have absolutely no facility . Nevertheless , I found it possible to follow the reports of some of the outstanding bridge hands played in European championships since 1932. // With a population of about 33 ? million , Norway is an enthusiastic bridge center . Although it has never won the European Championship , the country has fielded many fine teams and has often played the role of giant killer , just as it did in this year 's championship when its victory over France prevented that nation from winning the title . // Here is a hand played by Trygve Sommervelt , Norway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played in Vienna in 1934. // Three no trump would have been a far easier contract , but perhaps Sommervelt had visions of a possible slam . At any rate , in bidding five diamonds he courted disaster . However , Sommervelt supplemented his forthright bidding with some highly deceptive play . To fake East out of the killing defense , declarer had to throw away a good trick . Later he had to regain that trick in order to make his contract . // West next shifted to the 10 of hearts . Declarer realized that the 10 was a singleton , so , when East played the ace , South dropped the king ! It was n't immediately apparent where he could get this trick back , but it was obvious that he could not afford to keep the king , for an immediate heart ruff would defeat him . // East fell for it  --  and who could blame him ? Afraid to set up dummy 's jack by continuing hearts , East shifted back to spades . South trumped and ran all the diamonds . West had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to two clubs . Dummy then threw away the spade queen , keeping three clubs . To keep three clubs East had to discard his last heart , and South 's hidden 7 was the game-winning trick . // EXTRA TRICK // To throw dust into the opponents ' eyes , you sometimes have to throw gold dust . But any sacrifice is better than keeping the card that tells how to beat you .
