" Church , " said 15-year-old Sally Moore to the vicar , " is dull and boring . What you need is something slick and simple and to the point . " Replied the Rev. Richard Coote , 37 , of the Church of All Saints in Birmingham , England : " Produce it . " And Sally did . <P> Sally Moore ( her father is a medical technician ) spent a week rewriting the Church of England 's evening service , " in ordinary , everyday words , cutting out all the ' thines ' and ' thous ' and long , old-fashioned phrases . I cut out the psalms too , because I do n't believe teen-agers understand them . " Last week Sally 's service was held in All Saints after the usual congregation of about 60 adults had heard the regular evensong . More than 200 adolescents packed the church ten minutes early , and while they waited for the service to begin the organ warmed them with what Sally called a " really nice and significant song " - Frankie Laine 's My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of Jesus ' name , Vicar Coote warned the congregation : " The organist has been ordered to play fast . Make sure you keep up . " At the end of the service , Vicar Coote promised to repeat the experiment . " I 'm a square myself , " said he , " but my tastes do n't matter if Sally 's service brings teen-agers to church . " <P> In her teen-age adaptation , Sally forbore to touch the Lord 's Prayer ( " every teen-ager understands that " ) , but nothing else escaped her busy blue pencil . Sally 's rendering of the Apostle 's Creed : <P> I believe in Jesus Christ , the Son of God ; I believe that He came down to earth from heaven , healed the sick , helped the poor , and preached about His Father . I believe that He was taken and crucified on a wooden cross . That nails were driven through His hands and feet unmercifully , and that He suffered without measure as He died . I believe that after three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed the Son of God ; and I believe that all this happened for us that we might all believe in God the Father , the Son and the Holy Ghost , and three in one and one in three .
