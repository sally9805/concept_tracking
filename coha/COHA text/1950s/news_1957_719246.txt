txt The arrival in Washington today of British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and his group of topflight officials and , technicians means that opportunity is knocking . The wisdom of the ages emphasizes that opportunity knocks rarely and sometimes only once . If eitier or both of us miss this chance the results could be tragic . It is fortunate for us and for the Western World that the realities of the crisis which has arisen are clear and are now common knowledge . The two outstanding factors are the lead that the Russians have taken with the intercontinental ballistic missile and earth satellite and the tension being stirred up by the Russians in the Middle East . The Soviet Union is riding high and fast , making skillful and effective use of its spectacular successes and bringing the maximum pressure to bear on the weak , divided and confused Arab countries . Since the Middle East is the crossroads of Asia , Africa and Europe and since it contains the vital oil resources of the Persian Gulf the dangers to the West are obvious . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Macmillan . It is that our two nations and the free world will accomplish more if we work together . This may seem obvious , but it is a fact that we have not been working together fully either in the field of armed security and scientific progress or on the political problems of the Middle East . A combination of complacent belief that we had a safe lead and could go it alone , plus an unreasoning fear of the British Socialists , led to the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 with its hedges of secrecy and its refusal to share knowledge . The situation in the Middle East , for its part , has been weakened by a complex series of developments including the rise of Colonel Nasser in Egypt , the Suez Canal fiasco , Arab nationalism and , above all , the entry of Russia as a power in the Middle East . So far as Anglo-American relations generally are concerned , we should be frank and also take into account a distressing factor whose validity we need not discuss here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British distrust and disparagement of Secretary of State Dulles and his policies . One can argue about the causes of the situation today and about who was most at fault and who or what is to blame , but surely no one will try to deny that we - have all managed to get ourselves into a position which is unnecessarily retrograde and dangerous . The meeting which starts in Washington today can repair some of the damage and perhaps a good deal of it . It is the present and the future that count , not the past  --  except , perhaps , in one respect . What we need to do now is to recapture the sense of single-mindedness and teamwork that we had in the second World War . The Allies heat the Nazis to the atom bomb simply because British and American scientists pooled their knowledge and worked together . We had no searets from each other then Why , should we now ? One of tin first things that Congress should do when it reconvenes is to repea : those features of the Atomic En . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together as the British and Americans did during the second Work War . The danger may not seen quite so evident and " present " as did during that desperate shooting war , but the things that make life worth living for free men can be lost just as surely in the sort of tole war we are now fighting . To reach an agreed basis on political issues , especially with reference to the Middle East , is in some ways easier since no new legisla ? tion is required . Moreover , our two policies are essentially the same in their objective of trying to keel the area peaceful and free of Rus ? sian dominance . However , in present circumstances the United States has to carry the main burdens , militarily and economically . We can not expect to persuade the British that we have done too well , considering the present situation , but the object of this meeting in Washington is not to argue over the past but to work out policies that hold promise for a better future . The forces of the free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark days of the last war . The key to victory then was the AngloAmerican alliance . Today it is still the key to victory in the cold war . It is not too late , but there is no time to lose .
