The San Francisco Giants trailed the Boston Red Sox 4-0 as they went to bat in the first inning of an exhibition game at Phoenix , Ariz. last week . Boston 's lead lasted less than five minutes . The Giants ' Utility Infielder Ed Bressoud led off with a home run . Outfielder Willie Mays hit a triple to deepest center field . First Baseman Orlando Cepeda walloped a 450-ft. home run , and Outfielder Jackie Brandt followed with another homer-all off Ike Delock , Boston 's winningest pitcher last year . In his box behind third base , the Giants ' President Horace Stoneham smiled broadly . " This is a real team , " he said . " We 'll be there all the way this season , and if we win it , there may be no stopping us for five years to come . " Nobody seemed to mind that the Giants eventually dropped the game on a late-inning homer by Boston 's Frank Malzone , 9-7 . <P> Young &; Eager . For Horace Stoneham 's Giants are young , eager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs ( 727 ) than any other team in the National League , led the league for brief periods until early August , when the inadequate pitching staff finally folded completely . Explains Manager Bill Rigney : " We had to borrow tomorrow 's pitching today , and it finally caught up with us . " The Giants finished third , behind Milwaukee and Pittsburgh . <P> But over the winter , the Giants took on new strength while their chief rivals sagged . Milwaukee 's second baseman and sparkplug Red Schoendienst , recovering from tuberculosis , will be out of play all season , and the Braves looked unimpressive as they dropped 15 of their first 21 spring training exhibitions . Pittsburgh 's second-place Pirates gave up power that they could ill afford to lose when they traded Slugger Frank Thomas to the Cincinnati Reds . In the winter trading , the Giants picked up two established starting pitchers : Jack Sanford , 29 , who won 19 games for Philadelphia two years ago , and aging ( 33 ) Sam ( " Toothpick " ) Jones , a hard-throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 225 ) , was second in earned-run average ( 2.88 ) , managed a 14-13 record for a St. Louis team that scored fewest runs in the league . With Lefthanders Johnny Antonelli ( 16-13 last year ) and Mike McCormick ( 11-8 ) , and slow-balling Righthander Stu Miller ( whose 2.47 earned-run average was the league 's best last year ) , the Giants have the best group of pitchers in years . <P> Butcher in Field . Thanks to good fortune with rookies , the rest of the Giant team looks solid . First Baseman Cepeda , 21 , a big , amiable Puerto Rican , broke in last year with a .312 batting average , 25 home runs , 96 runs batted in ( " I butcher in field , " he says , " but you forget bad field when I hit " ) . Catcher Bob Schmidt , 25 , hit 14 homers as a rookie last year . Third Baseman Jim Davenport , 25 , hits adequately ( .256 ) , fielded so brilliantly in his freshman season that he is already considered one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortstop , Andre Rodgers , 24 , a onetime Bahamas cricket player , seems finally to have solved big-league pitching , was leading the team in batting average ( .414 ) , as the Giants broke camp at week 's end .
