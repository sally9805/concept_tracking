At its most caustic , social satire is brewed from sweet reasonableness , and nothing could be more reasonable than the modest educational proposal that is the basis of a spoofing report from the 21st century by British Sociologist Michael Young . First premise of The Rise of the Meritocracy , 1870-2033 , published in London , is merely this : every bright child , regardless of his parents ' wealth or lack of it , should get the best education he is capable of absorbing . The proposition is hardly alarming , but by the book 's end it has left a trail like a runaway milkwagon horse . Among the casualties : the British Labor Party ( which Young served as research secretary from 1945-51 ) ; the commissar 's cast of mind that sees education solely as a means for national advancement ; the sociologist 's view of the individual as a cell that lives for the benefit of the organism , society ; and the psychologist 's notion that intelligence and aspiration can be measured like prize trout . <P> I + E = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the events , starting in the 1940s , that led to a blossoming Utopia . By mid-20th century , he assumes , Britain 's best minds had realized that their country 's economy could no longer compete with those of the U.S. , Russia and China under a haphazard system that prevented some bright children of the poor from reaching responsible jobs rightfully theirs , and fortified doltish sons of the rich and well-born in positions of power . The answer : meritocracy , which is rule by the most talented , determined according to the formula I+E = M ( Intelligence plus Effort equals Merit ) . <P> Britain 's socialists , dedicated opponents of wealth and high birth , helped to get things going , Young reports , but they nearly ruined everything by insisting that equality of opportunity meant educating all children , bright and dull , in the same comprehensive schools ( this , very roughly , is what the Labor Party currently proposes ) . Clearly , this plan was too American , writes Young : " Americans , far from prizing brainpower , despised it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they established common schools which recognized no child superior to another . " Another kind of education was necessary for Britain ; " Englishmen of the solid centre never believed in equality . They assumed that some men were better than others , and only waited to be told in what respect . " <P> By 2020 intelligence tests had been developed that could spot a child 's ability and bent at three . Children with IQs of 116 and up were sent to state-supported grammar schools ; dullards were taught to read , write and play games at common schools . Uplifting leisure activities were planned for bright students , who " no longer need to spend any of their spare time with their families . Their homes have become simply hotels , to the great benefit of the children . " Students , of course , received a " learning wage , " were members of the B.U.G.S.A. ( British Union of Grammar School Attenders ) .
