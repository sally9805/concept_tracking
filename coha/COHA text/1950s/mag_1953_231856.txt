During the long months of truce talks at Panmunjom , the closest links between U.S. prisoners of war and their families back home were pictures taken in Korean prison camps by Associated Press 's Pulitzer Prizewinning* Photographer Frank Noel . It was a strange sort of beat . Noel , himself a P.W . since his 1950 capture while covering the Marines at Chosin Reservoir , used a Speed Graphic and films forwarded by A.P . through the Panmunjom camp . Censored by both Chinese and U.S. military , his pictures of beaming C.I.s seemed at once good propaganda to the Communists and good news for the U.S. home front . Last week , when Frank Noel reached Panmunjom in a group of released prisoners , his unsought " scoop " came to an end . <P> Old friends in the press corps mobbed the dusty red truck that brought him back . " Papps " Noel , his blue prison pants rolled above the knee , his sunburned face worn but happy , looked older than his 48 years . Noel said that after his camera arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24-hour guard , shuttled him from camp to camp to take photographs . Added Noel : " At first , lots of the boys refused to pose . But when a few pictures came back in the mail from their home-town papers , they realized I was playing it straight ... I think the pictures did a lot more good than they ever could have done harm . " <P> Faithful to an old A.P . rule , Noel insisted that the Communists group the G.I.s according to states and home towns , so that the pictures would get maximum play back home . He wrote no captions , jotting down only names and addresses . Despite Communist cropping , the published photos gave the U.S. Army valuable information on prison layouts and locations , and positive P.W . identifications . But one beat widely attributed to Noel-the pictures of captured Major General William Dean-was a Communist plant . Noel told newsmen last week that he never saw , much less photographed , the general . <P> In Hong Kong last week , another American journalist started on the long voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lo Wu , last stop in Red China , disgorged harried , sweating John William ( " Bill " ) Powell , his wife and two children . Powell , 34. editor of Shanghai 's China Monthly Review until it folded last month " because we went broke , " was the last U.S. journalist to publish in Red China . <P> Young Bill 's father , who founded the old China Weekly Review , had been a courageous voice of freedom in the Far East . After Pearl Harbor , the Japanese punished him with a prison sentence that brought starvation , gangrene and the loss of ten toes , and hastened his death . Bill revived the weekly as a monthly , but turned it into a mouthpiece for the Chinese Reds . In recent issues , the Review called the Rosenberg trial a " frame-up , " Point Four an " imperialist plot , " and had " verified " U.S. " germ warfare " in Korea . <P> Newsmen who asked Powell last week why he had never criticized any Red action were rewarded with Powell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand . In China , there 's a new appreciation of the role of the press . " <P>
