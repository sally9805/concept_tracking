A GREAT part of modern life is lived by artificial light , and yet no major painter has devoted himself to this glittering and multi-hued area until now . This week Manhattan 's Babcock Galleries put on show the work of Chicago 's Richard Florsheim , the first artist to attempt an all-out embrace of the world of electrical , chemical and neon fires . With painters everywhere attempting to reestablish contact , however ephemeral , with nature , Florsheim points out that man-made lights are also part of nature . The nighttime view from an airplane or a train can take one 's breath away , and add new dimensions to the ordinary conception of what is beautiful . <P> Born 43 years ago into a wealthy Chicago family ( Thor Power Tool Co . ) , Florsheim was a painfully shy child , channeled all his energies into straight-A scholarship and crude , gloomy art . His father reluctantly helped him get an art education in Europe during the 1930s , but before World War II Florsheim managed to sell just one picture . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unexpected streak of scientific acumen , developed a radar plane-spotting technique that is still considered basic . But at war 's end Florsheim still found himself as far as ever from solving the problems in his art . He buckled down to a back-breaking work schedule in his Chicago studio and exhibited only on occasion . <P> Happily married , and with an art teaching job to make ends meet , Florsheim still felt and painted misery . His black works found few buyers ; he did not mind . " You would n't expect someone two years out of college to be made president of General Motors , because you know he would n't have the mature experience . Yet we expect this of painters . But it is much harder to be a good painter than president of General Motors . ' ' Slowly , out of the gloom in Florsheim 's studio , more positive and colorful pictures began emerging . " I do n't think most artists go through a blinding transformation ; it 's like a shingled roof with no start and no finish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past few years when it comes to communicating what is going on around us . The artist is an interpreter after all ; he 's building the culture just as other people build buildings . He 's communicating emotion-half of which is supplied , naturally , by the viewer . " <P> Viewers now snap up everything he offers . The peculiar luminosity of his technique , which involves mixing the colors with wax and applying them cold with a palette knife , contributes to Florsheim 's recent rise . So does his increasing ability to suggest deep spaces and complex forms without defining them . More important is the fact that his pictures bring over into the world of art a once dim and obscure night world , newly sparkling .
