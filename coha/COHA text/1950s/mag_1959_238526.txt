Fearlessly at home in the water , the way a fisherman 's sons often are , the Fukushi brothers splashed about last week in the protective shallows breaking over the narrow shale shelf of their little beach on Okujiri Island , ten miles off Hokkaido 's southwestern shore . When 14-year-old Masami Fukushi plunged off the shelf and sprinted out into deep water toward a rock 50 yards away , his younger brothers , Masakatsu , 12 , Takeshi , 10 , and Takeaki. 9 , quickly gave chase . <P> With his head start , Masami had a long lead . But suddenly he whipped about and started churning for shore , crying : " Same da ! Nigero ! " ( It 's a shark ! Run ! ) Closer to the shelf , his three brothers quickly made it back to safety and stood up to watch Masami 's progress . Some ten yards behind him , but rapidly closing the gap , a glistening black triangle cut through the waves . Moments later Masami 's brothers screamed with horror when the dorsal fin slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . Warned by their cries , Masami abruptly flailed his arms backward , and the shark 's jaws snapped on empty air . As the fish flashed by , Masami instinctively wrapped his arms around its slippery middle and hung on for his life . <P> Without a word , his three brothers dived into the roiling fray , now almost at the shelf 's edge , and clutched the shark 's body , fins and tail . Panic-stricken , the shark lunged to escape-but in the wrong direction , toward the shelf-and an incoming swell lofted the four boys and the fish in a thrashing mass into the shallows ' foot-deep waters . Grabbing rocks , the brothers clubbed the shark to death . Ten minutes later , alarmed fishermen racing to the scene found the four small boys , exhausted but proud , resting beside their unorthodox catch : the still twitching body of a 7-ft. , 180-lb. salmon shark . Admitted the littlest , Takeaki : " I was scared . "                @ @ @ @ @
