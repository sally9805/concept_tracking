the morning of the Bride NT O T more than two hours ago I woke up and the sun was shining through the pair of faded yellow curtains . I could hear the robins scolding just outside the window , and imagine the scent of the lilacs I had seen dimly the night before . Already the house , even in its quietness , seemed less strange , because I had slept with him , and his pillow , indented , was warm to the touch . I thought he had slipped away while I slept out of delicacy , or embarrassment , or both  --  because he was capable of both  --  or perhaps , inure mundanely , only to surprise me by making coffee in the shiny modern kitchen below . So I lay trying to forget certain things and to remember others , and all the while the robins scolded ; I thought there must have been a cat prowling around , though I heard nothing except the voices of the birds , and somehtivs ; , blotting out even that , the rising voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! without realizing , 1 had noticed it all the nights before , back , back , over the stretch of years , but if you have n't the ears to hear such things , what is the good of their telling you ? I was really listening for him , wondering why he did n't come , and then I remembered , he must have gone to see her . And that was something I 'd have to get used to , for years to come . Somewhere in the house a door was gently opened , and more gently closed . Slipping out of bed , I turned to the window that looked out over the garden behind the house . And there I saw him , wearing a faded sports jacket and an old felt green hat I had never seen on him before , going down a flagstone walk that was overrun with weeds . This was my first glimpse of the open country against which the house stood , facing as it did the gaunt streets of the little suburb . Even in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first the apple orchard , its trees thick and broken and barren , and beyond that a meadow , and then a little woods . He lingered once in the orchard to kick , meaninglessly , the exposed root of a dying tree ; then he went on , picking his way through the tall grass until he reached the jagged line of trees beyond . When he was out of sight the room in which I stood , my bare feet on the hardwood floor , went suddenly cold . But I had the opportunity  --  the first since we were married at the minister 's house  --  to think . Except that my mind would n't work right ; it turned to unimportant things , like wondering what the girls at the office were doing , what they were talking about , if they were talking about me . If they knew something , even now , that I did n't know . We had gone together for nearly thirteen years . We met during ' the war , one autumn when he was in the city on furlough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have cornered him , except that a young girl has n't the advantage over a man six years her senior , especially when their backgrounds are so different . But I think he would have married me then , if I 'd insisted ; only I was against those hurry-up war marriages , and for that matter , still am . The trouble was , we never talked things through , all the way , mean . My roommate told me I was that way because I was an orphan , and took the " uncominunicability of others " as a matter of course . As for him , I supposed it was his upbringing , from all I 'd heard of it ; the fact that he lived way out here in the country , the only son of a widowed mother ; and  --  yes , there 's no use dodging it , I 've known the truth all along , even when I tried to shut my eyes to it  --  the fact of the mother herself . When he came back from the war he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the crux of the whole matter . He would n't so much as introduce me to her , yet I always felt she was with us , even on our gayest times together ; and love , the kind of love that leads to intimacy or marriage or both , does n't bloom when there 's that kind of interference . But maybe I speak only by hindsight after all , because I ca n't say I realized so much that was the matter at the time . I DID N'T realize anything . it was just a kind of shy optimism , **28;1440;TOOLONG that actually amounted to stupidity . I do n't know what I thought I was waiting for ; I do n't know what I thought he was waiting for . We just " went together , " a pale , week-after-week romance , while he " took care " of his mother and I went to night school in order to better myself . It 's hard to see now how I endured the years because I look back on them as a whole ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing the world farther to one side . Sometimes we quarreled and were apart for months at a time ; but loneliness , that special loneliness peculiar to the unaccepted , would invariably drive us together again . And I would ask : " How is your mother ? " " I do n't see how I can leave her , " he 'd answer , as if anybody had asked him to . It sounded so odd , coming from a big , square-shouldered man , and one who spent most of his time in the city , away from home anyhow . " She depends on me ; I 've got to guard her against shock . " 1 came in time to understand that by " shock " he meant marriage : his marriage , certainly his marriage to me . But when he talked about her , it was always out of the past : their companionship when he was a child ; how they used to read and play games and go to the theater together ; her dependence on him once his father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she keeps to her room , " was all of a contemporary nature I could get out of him . So I came to picture her in my mind as a MAGAZINE white-haired , poker-backed woman , using her grief , real or imagined , to hold him forever in her grip , perhaps not even suspecting that existed or could exist . I hated her and feared her and yet there were days when I did not even think of her . Only once did I summon up the courage to take the bus out to where they lived and visit her  --  privately , as I supposed ; determined that though she might despise me , she should at least hear the sound of my voice . I think that in my secret mind I hoped for the happy ending , hoped that once we actually met she would like me and want me for a daughter-in-law . She did not answer the door . I imagined -- -I feel now that it was my imagination  --  that a curtain stirred at one of the windows . When I told hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sleeping , " he explained , quietly but positively , as if certain of his facts . And yet we had fun together in those " middle years , " so that even at this moment I can look back on them as the happiest of my life . We went to decent little night clubs , had a few drinks , and danced . In the city time can slip by ; the years follow one another , until at last you open your eyes  --  perhaps it is the bitter day when you turn thirty  --  and you ask yourself , What has happened ? But it 's too late , or you think it 's too late ; so why not go on as before ? If I were to write a column for the lovelorn , I would throw out all the letters from adolescents and concentrate on those who are in their twenties , especially their late twenties : for if you have problems then , your last chance for happiness has come , and the one great danger is that you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it that , by remarks made by friends . " Ditch him , " or , " Do n't marry a mama 's boy . " I did ditch him , but he always came back , and I had n't anybody else , I could n't seem to interest anybody else , you ca n't go up to any man you happen to know and say , Wo n't you please go out with me ? And yet I always had the feeling that he sincerely wanted me to marry him , that somehow I could " save " him  --  from something , I did n't know what  --  if I did marry him . T H E N it happened , and I 'm not sure this confused , insane moment , how it did . Unconsciously I must have been studying him , knowing his weaknesses and the essential rhythms of his life . That was something he had taught me to do , because in all ways except that one way he was so normal and human  --  yes , and kind  --  and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman . He often discussed with me his methods , how everyone in the world was a " prospect , " and could be " sold , " if only you studied him long enough and learned how to take your advantage when the time came . That 's what I did with him ; and it was n't by trickery , either  --  moonlight and roses , or ten-dollar perfume , or even by getting him to take a cocktail too litany . At the time , I felt as if I had been inspired : I mean , that I was being moved by some force outside myself , so much so that I went out and bought myself a stunning brown suit with pumps to match , just for the occasion , and gave two weeks ' notice at the office . That was the kind of faith I had in what I was doing . I took out the license , too , five days in advance , as the law requires ; and when yesterday came , I pm it up to him at the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at Fox 's , where everything is blazing . I let him know what I had done , that the time had irrevocably come for him to make the decision , that we were n't going to be married next year , or next month , or even next day . It was either now , this very night , or not at all , forever . There 's nothing sissy about him in his manner , or in the steady gaze of his warm , brown eyes . He smiled , and put his hands , with the shapely fingers spread , on the cloth . The instant I had spoken , panic took hold of me ; I knew him to he a prize , and the conviction came to me that his mother was only an excuse  --  that no woman , or man either , could ever have kept him from what he really wanted . And I was ready to break down , give everything over , forget that half my life was wasted and done for , when he seized my hands in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only know that his words were gay as bubbles , and as hard to capture . But I had won ! That was the wonderful thing , the big thing , and it had been so easy after all ! Outside the restaurant a warm , gentle rain was falling ; enough to ruin my hair , but I did n't even care about that ... I ca n't recall the minister 's name , or where he lived , or anything about that whirling quarter of an hour , except the face of the minister 's wife , all gray , like cold ash , the eyes watery and constantly seeking mine . I think she must have gone on watching me from the window as we left the house and got into the car , but I refused to look back ; I remember saying something silly as we drove off , something about not being a Lot 's Wife . " What ? What are you talking about ? " he asked , slipping an arm around my waist ; but I would n't answer . I only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be listened to , except when I said I loved him . So we came here , to this house , and he showed me the clean , white kitchen  --  the rest of the rooms were n't too orderly  --  where we had waffles and bacon and the most wonderful coffee , just like the coffee he used to make on our campfire trips , because he himself so often said , and I believe him , that making coffee is a man 's job . And then when I asked , " Are n't you going to tell her ? " ? artlessly , too artlessly , because I had studied so hard to make it so  --  he gave me a vague smile , and nodded , and that was all . I had been going to insist on meeting her that night , but now I lost my nerve . Going up the staircase , with its threadbare carpet and oak bannister , I lost my nerve again . I could n't even speak , " Take light steps , " he said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stairs , where the upper hall was lighted by a single amber bulb , he lingered ; and I do n't think it was weakness then so much as fear  --  not personal fear , either , but something like a racial dread  --  that etched itself briefly on his face , and was gone . He pointed a finger . " That 's her room there , " he said . I did n't want to breathe ; something inside me whispered , Here is your enemy , she hates you ; and I could n't bear the thought of anything , tangible or intangible , coming between us now . It was my belief that he wanted to go to her ; to tiptoe into her room , chancing she would not wake up , and kiss the thin , proud , commanding lips . I E DID not go . In our own room , that had been his so long and was beautifully kept , in which I imagined still the touch of her hand , full of remembrances , perhaps of suffering , childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut now so sharply off , I dared not suggest the meaning of its change . He stood at the back window facing the garden and orchard , both lost now in blackness ; then he drew the shade and turned back to me , his face smiling , all but his eyes , that I do n't think ever smiled . Some time deep in the night I awoke sensing that he too was awake : a clock downstairs had just chimed the hour . I wanted to ask him , Are you happy ? , but hearing his heavy breathing again , I shut my eyes . Standing , then , early this morning at the same window , I tried to guess why he had slipped so quietly out of the house . It was early ; there were still wisps of haze clinging to the trees . I wanted to follow him , but held back . What if she should hear me or meet me on the stairs ? Even come to this room and open the door ? In a frenzy , I got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hall . There were noises , the flapping of some drape at an open window , but nothing like a human step or voice . I could n't bear it . I wanted to talk to her , to see her , not to hide myself any longer : above all , some courage , born of the night , told me I was no longer afraid . I walked to the head of the stairs and beyond . Her door was closed : silent , but penetrable . Going to it , breathing against its cracked , varnished surface , I knocked . There was no answer . 1 knocked again , distinctly , three times . I do n't know what I felt most for her at that moment , love or hate ; it could have been both . Because whatever might threaten to come later , every woman looks forward to meeting at least once the mother of the man she loves . That was why I opened the door and took one step into the room that bad been closed against me so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocking . It was empty . I mean , I knew instantly , without seeing or hearing , that there was no person there . It was larger than our room , but dark ; the shades were drawn , and you had the feeling that a Hood of sunlight would have disturbed something there , possibly destroyed it . Opposite the door was a fireplace , with a thick rug in front of it , and a clock on the white mantelpiece that was ticking but that had been set wrong : its hands were at half-past four . The bed was made , its coverlet tightly drawn ; and there was a bolster at the head . I must have stood where I was a full minute  --  a long time in that quiet room , where the win-MAGAZINE doves were closed ; and the air was not musty but dry and still , motionless and without sound  --  staring at the bed , my eyes becoming accustomed to the twilight that was reminiscent of sick rooms and closed rooms everywhere , sensing , in spite of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away , almost as if she were standing behind me , or were at the door ready to come in , to surprise me and accuse rue of spying on her or of stealing her things . Now I could see colors as well as shapes : the pale green wallpaper figured with designs of ivy , a tapestried easy chair ; a wardrobe ; a dresser with a marble top ; and a writing desk . What she slept in , kept her clothing in , sat at while she wrote her letters or made out " accounts . " I walked from one to another , touching them . The marble top was wiped clean , and nothing was on it , not a pin , not a fleck of powder ; but a coat of dust lay on the desk . There was a calendar there , too , showing the day and date of the month  --  yesterday 's day and date  --  but no year ; and on a stand beside the bed I caught sight of his picture , a familiar photograph mounted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , only a larger print , on my own dresser in my room . It had been taken a long while ago , while he was still in uniform ; he looked too boyish in it now , but 1 had got so used to seeing it that I had been scarcely aware of the fact . Now , in this setting , on this table and in this room , the face that stared at me  --  queerly smiling , asking more than it answered  --  was like a stranger 's . I wanted to cry . Turning away , I walked twice around the room , stopping both times beside the bed , looking at it , trying to discover what was wrong with it , what was out of focus and untrue . I wanted to peek inside the wardrobe , too , hilt held back , because I was afraid ; I could n't bear the thought of turning around and seeing her in the doorway , her cold gray eyes ( 1 could n't imagine them as anything but gray ) meeting mine for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet , catching sight of a key in the lock of the desk drawer , 1 thought nothing of going to it and pulling the drawer open . Yes , I ought to have been afraid of the room , and run away from it ; but what fear there was in me was overwhelmed by curiosity . T H E drawer was stuffed with papers  --  mostly receipts and old bills marked " Paid " and used check books and bundles of canceled checks held together by rubber bands . There was a Japanese Ian , too , the kind you can buy at any novelty shop ; and beneath the fan a pasteboard box , full of cheap rings . Underneath the rings , flat on the bottom of the box , was a large , square envelope , unsealed , with my husband 's name written across it in a bold hand . The sight of it excited me terribly , I could n't have told why ; I only know that I lost all sense of where I was and of the silence of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the envelope , reached inside , and drew out a handful of papers . I spread them out , fan-shaped , and read what was on them  --  in a single glance , not in detail , I did n't need to . They were sympathy cards , edged thinly in black , and a newspaper clipping . The clippingwas brittle and beginning to crumble ; it carried ? coldly , as all newsprint must  --  the death announcement . June 2 , 1945 . Just twelve years ago . I heard him then ; perhaps unconsciously I had heard him on the stairs , and my mind was only now reacting . He had come hack from the meadow , or woods , or wherever he had been , still wearing the sports jacket that looked so incongruous on him , and with his shoes wet from the morning grass : standing in the doorway , his hands in his pocket , a queer smile on his face , his eyes searching not my face but my hands , my trembling hands , from which the scraps of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. S. Merwin I HAVE been a long time in a strange country . The natives have been kind , in their weird climate , Receiving use among them as one of themselves . Their virtues are different from ours , and in some ways Superior . 1 have lost the sense Of absurdity regarding many of their odd customs . I get their wry lingo tangled up with my own , Maybe you have to go far away To learn where it is that names you . The fruits here Are excellent ; better than at home . I can no longer taste them . I would be glad To be standing in a drab city of my recollection Where no one but newsboys would name this place And they mispronouncing . I hope I may Before too long .
