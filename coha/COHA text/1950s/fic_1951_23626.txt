O To Know the Country A Story by Stephen Becker Drawings by Harry 0 . Diamond 1 T WAS his first time in this part of west China , and the American had been fas- cinated by the changing countryside , the long dusty fields and the quick ravines and the sudden mounds , and off against the horizon the changing face of a range of low mountains . Because he had been staring off to the north , he did not notice the small still town with its head-high wall until he had rounded the curve in the road and walked about fifty yards toward it . When he saw it he stopped and pulled a tattered map from the pocket of his leather jacket , knowing even as he brought it closer to his eyes that it would not help him . The town-was not indi-cated . He put the map away and looked at the town . There was not much to see from where lie was . The low wall , and beyond it the flat roofs of a dozen houses , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack and hung it over his ? right shoulder , putting his fist through the looped strap in front and supporting the pack with one arm . With his left hand lie wiped the sweat from his face . He shrugged then and walked forward , toward the gate set into the wall . It was not the first time he had run onto a town like this , a town set across the main road so that two gates had to be negotiated before you were on the road again . He was no longer surprised by it , or by anything , as he told himself . A walking trip , he said , was at best romantic ; and he would not be making this one if he were not sure that it would be the last summer for a long time when a man would be able to pack his pack and point his face west and just walk . What struck him as odd sometimes Was that by going west he had left the Pacific behind . But west was where he had wanted to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and away from his friends and away from what he had to call the international set , although he could not say it without laughing . ( In a bar in Shanghai a man had said to him once , a slim and well-dressed young man , pale and with fine features , " Say , fellow , what 's become of the set ? " He had stared blankly at the man . " The set ? " " Why , " the man had said , " the international set . " ) And next year the chance might not be there , and there was always the feeling that even if you did not belong to it in the first place you might be doomed to go back to the set and not leave it again . So he had left them and been glad of it , and now he was three hundred miles west and sweating and approaching the gate of the town wall . A Doc bounded out toward him . He stopped . The gray dog came closer to him , walking on stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dog growled . The American stood still . The dog came to him and sniffed at his clothes . The dog was large and lean and cruel-looking , with his snout wrinkled and his eyes menacing . The American touched the dog 's neck . The dog stiffened . The American stroked the dog 's neck , and slowly the dog relaxed . The American slapped him lightly on the neck . The dog moved closer and rubbed his neck against the man 's leg . The American laughed . Now the cruel look was gone from the dog 's eyes and his snout was unwrinkled and laughing . The dog wagged his bushy tail and licked the American 's hand , and the American laughed again . He walked toward the gate with the dog at his side and jumping against him for attention . At the gate he pounded . He let the pack fall from his shoulder and stood pounding at the heavy wood . The dog stood alertly beside him . When the American heard footsteps and a voice he stopped pounding . The gate opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at him . There had been annoyance on the man 's face , but it changed quickly to astonishment . The man opened the gate wide , and the American stepped in . The old man was wearing a gray gown , and looked clean and cool in the heat . He closed the gate , and then , putting his wrinkled hands together , he bowed . The American returned the bow . " Thank you , " he said . The old man 's astonishment grew ; he nodded rapidly for several seconds and then said : " It was nothing . It was nothing , " and bowed again . " It was very good of you , " the American said . " Please , " the old man said . He cleared his throat . " Will you pass through immediately , or will you stay ? " He spoke slowly and very distinctly . The American smiled . " Perhaps I will stay for a time . I would like to eat something . It is noon . Is there a restaurant in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms upward . " Ah , no , " he said . " In this town there is no restaurant . " The two stood silent near the gate . The American took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his face again . " If it is not too bold of me , " the old man said , and stopped . " Please go on , " the American said . " For one so young and alone it is not easy . You have already been very helpful . " " I have done nothing , " the old man said . " I was about to suggest that you accept my poor hospitality , but I was afraid to ask for such an honor . " " It is I who am honored , " the American said . " I would not have dared to presume . " " Please , " the old man said . " May I take your pack ? " " No , no . I insist , " the American said . He picked up his pack and slung it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked down the dusty town street , with the dog trotting behind them . T HE sun had baked the town dry ; the dirt wails of the houses and the yellow dirt of the road gave off the same harsh brilliant glare . The two had not walked far when doors opened and townspeople looked out at them . Soon three children were walk-ing behind them . The children were bone-thin and naked . The old man was thin , too , with none of the legendary fatness of a village elder . There was nothing in the road or at the roadside except a broken wooden wheel . The glare of the dusty road brought tears to the American 's eyes . " I have not asked your name , " the old man said . The American told him . " And I have not asked yours . " " My name is Chang , " the old man said . " I am the eider here . " " Ai , " the American said . " I have eyes but can not see Mount T'ai . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked up and smiled at the American . " You speak so well , " he said . " That is not true , " the American said . " There is no need to be so polite . " " But it is true , " the old man said . " Please . This is my poor home . " He stopped before a doorway and bowed , signing the American to precede him . The American nodded his thanks and went inside , halting just over the doorsill . Behind him the old man stopped . " Please . Go in . " The American went all the way into the dim room . He could see a table and some sawhorses . The sawhorses were chairs . Set into one wall of the room was a fireplace . There was an unlit lamp on the table . The ceiling was low . The floor was of dirt . The American dropped his pack in a corner . The room was cool and pleasantly moist after the road . The old man went through a doorway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreigner " was the only word the American caught . Someone answered the old man . The voices shouted back and forth . The other voice , a woman 's , began to sound plaintive . The old man 's pleaded with it . The American heard the word " honor . " Then there was along stream of words from the woman , and finally the old man answering firmly . When the old man came back into the room he smiled at the American . " Let me offer you some yellow wine , " he said . " It is not much , and is very Poor , but perhaps you are thirsty . " " I am thirsty , " the American said . " You are too kind . " T HE old man went out of the room and came back with a cruet and two bowls . He half-filled the two bowls and presented one to the American . Behind the American , feet pattered . He turned . Two children came into the room . They were not children the American had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as naked . " My two grandchildren , " the old man said . The children laughed and whispered loudly . Their hair was long and dirty . They looked like two girls , but because of their nakedness the American saw that they were a boy and a girl . " They are very fine-looking children , " he said . " They are mischievous , " the old man said . The children giggled . The old man held his bowl up toward the American . " Dry cup , " he said . " Dry cup . " They drank . The old man sniffed the air . " She has started the fire , but not the dinner . " " I did not want to make anyone hurry , " the American said . " No , no , no . We were about to eat in any case . " " Good , " the American said . Somewhere outside the dog barked madly and then whined . " Will you go far ? " the old man asked . " I hoped to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far . And from where do you come ? " " I come from Peiping . " The old man nodded . " That is very far . You have been walking for some time . " " I have , " the American said . " I have enjoyed my trip . " " Do you have friends in Yulin ? " " No , " the American said . " I take the trip only to see the country and meet its people . " " As you are a foreigner , " the old man nodded , " that is necessary . But you have chosen the hottest time of year . " " Yes . I have noticed that the crops are burning in many places . " The old man looked sad . " They were not good last year , either , " he said . " There has been too little to eat . " The American looked concerned . " Then perhaps I bother you too much . I did not wish to add to burdens which were already ( Treat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man waved him back to his seat on the sawhorse . " Here it is not so bad . Here we have enough . Here we even have meat . " He smiled proudly . " Good , " the American said . " Then it can not yet be too serious . " " It is not serious at all , " the old man said . " Farther west you may see how serious it is . " " I hope it is not too bad , " the American said . " Not for myself , you understand . " " Of course . For the others . " The old man sniffed again . " The rice is cooking , " he said , " and the meat . It will not be long . " " This is too good . " " At best , it is poor hospitality . " They smiled at each other . The old man 's smile was shy and very happy . T TIE woman too was old . She brought in the bowls of rice and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was introduced to the American . The American thanked her for her trouble in feeding him . She bowed again and went out . The two men sat at the table . Soon the woman came in again with a teapot and two cups . She set them on the table and left . The two men ate and talked and laughed . In the kitchen the American heard the whining voices of the children and the suddenly grating angry voice of the woman , and then the children were crying . The old man took a piece of meat from the meat platter and put it into the American 's rice bowl . " It is the most tender . " " Thank you , " the American said , smiling and realizing that he should not have listened to what was happening in the kitchen . He ate the old man 's offering . It was very tender and tasted like old beef . Briefly the American wondered if it might not be diseased . He decided it was not . In any case he would eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by changing your mind after it was cooked . He ate the meat and the bowl of rice . Several times the old man poured tea for him . The old man was no longer surprised at his being a for-eigner , and talked amiably through most of the meal , giving him precise instructions for getting to Yulin . After the meal the American offered cigarettes , and the old man took one . They smoked in silence , and when the old man 's was gone the American offered him another . He accepted . They sat on the front doorstep , looking out into the blinding street and smoking cigarettes . After half an hour the American said he would have to cro . " I would like to thank the lady once more , " he said . " Ah , no , " the old man said . " She is not there just now . Besides , you have already thanked her . I shall tell her you enjoyed lunch , if I may . " " You certainly may , " the American said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-cooked and of an excellent taste . " " I am pleased that you liked it . " " And now I must go . I wonder if you would permit me to leave with you some of these cigarettes . I saw that you enjoyed them . and it is the least I can do for having upset your entire day . " " I could not , " the old man said , raising a quick hand in protest . " You have already brought too much happiness to my day . I could not forgive myself if I took more from you . ' ' " But you would be doing me an honor , " the American said . " I would be unhappy if I felt that my offer displeased you . " MAGAZINE 1 N THE end the old man took the cigarettes . The American went back inside for his pack , picked it up , slung it , and went back to the doorway . He and the old man stood in the sunlight and said good-by . They bowed , and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American walked down the road . The old man stood in the doorway smiling after him . When he had gone about fifty feet the American looked back and waved to the old man . He saw the small house , flat and bright in the sun , and from where he was he could see the back yard , the two children naked in the sun and digging in the parched earth , behind them a tall thick pole with the millstone under it and the bushy gray animal tail nailed to the pole like a flag , and then he looked back at the old man and waved and smiled again , and turned and went on through the town . With much surprise but no ceremony they let him through the gate at the far end of the town , and he walked quietly in the sun for several minutes . When he arrived at a small clump of trees with a brook running in the ditch beside them he remembered the tail on the pole . He stopped and stood in the middle of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the cold shock as though his body were freezing inward on itself he ran to a tree , and when he had reached it he stood behind it vomiting , on the side away from the road . Plus Ca Change .. HE Russian peasant 's idea as to the relation of Holy Russia to the I rest of the world is curious . " Were there roads and villages in Germania ? " asked one . To the best of my belief there were . " There were no towns though as large as Petrograd . " I rather fancied the contrary and instanced a flourishing little community of some five million souls on an island , with which I was very well acquainted . The youth eyed me with deep suspicion . " Were there railways in Germania ? " Only about a hundred times the mileage of the Russian railways . " There was no electric light though , because Jahlochkoff , a Russian , reports of Russia in the eighteen-eighties in Lord Frederick Hamilton 's The Vanished Pomps of Yesterday , 1921.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
