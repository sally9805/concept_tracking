A Story by ROBIN WHITE Drawings by Harry 0 . Diamond When 1 was born , I drew in the common air , and fell upon the earth , which is of like nature , and the first voice which I uttered was crying , as all others do . ? N. T. Apocrypha , Wisdom of Solomon , VII , 3. 1 /IY OLDER brother , Aaron , always did things the hard way . He had a flair for the dramatic , a sort of love of all things Indian , and it suited him : it was his style of living . Consequently , 1 was not surprised one morning when he announced his intention of becoming a Sannyasi. a holy man . It was on a Sunday , shortly after the onset of the monsoon , and we were all seated around the breakfast table of the sprawling mission bungalow in Nfeigudy . Last night 's rains had left everything washed bright , and the cool moist air , sifting in gently across the pillared verandas , was pervaded by an earthy smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the morning sun . There was a certain pleasing sharpness to life  --  especially in the way the light sparkled on leaves and glinted along the blank white walls where ponderous rosewood furniture stood in chiseled outline -- that made it difficult to think of the vari-colored insects which , not so long ago , had flown in on diaphanous wings from the darkness and the rain and now lay in an amorphous heap beneath the extinguished night lamp . Father had just finished reading devotions , and since he insisted on a respectful silence before letting us eat , the butler stood with folded arms near the door , waiting for Mother to give the signal to serve the food by ringing the little elephant bell next to her fingerbowl . Everyone was waiting for her to hurry up and ring it and end the period of respectful silence , but she did not . There was a disciplinary action to be taken first : Aaron had been late coming down to breakfast . As a matter of fact , Father had to delay devotions nearly five minutes for him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table without a shirt . Of course , it was too late then for Father to send him back after one , so with a grim look of disapproval , he proceeded to read from the Bible . Sometimes he would hand the Bible around and each of us would have to stumble over a little bit of it aloud . But this morning he kept it to himself , his voice stiff with restrained anger . None of us was thinking much about devotions because of Aaron . At least I was n't . I kept wondering what Father would say to him when it was over . However I took care to keep my hands in my lap and my attention focused on the plate , except for one or two sly glances at Aaron . I could tell something was bothering him just the way he sat , dressed in yesterday 's dirty khaki shorts , barefoot , both elbows on the table , an abstract , pensive look in his eyes as he fingered his napkin ring . Now Father hates to have anyone be late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of us come " improperly clad " to the table . So T figured Aaron was just trying to bait him . He 's an expert at that , Aaron is . Everything he does annoys Father . It seems to come naturally . You never turn around but what you see him busy getting the old man 's goat . As soon as the reading and prayers were over , Father set his books aside , shifted his chair , and looked sternly down his long nose at Aaron . " Will you stop that incessant fiddling with your napkin ring ! " he said , separating his words for emphasis . Aaron jerked his head to throw his black hair away from his forehead , and giving the ring one last vigorous twirl , sat back in his chair , the skin of his forearms peeling away from the high polish of the table with a soft tearing sound . I waited for something to happen as the ring clattered insolently to a standstill . " Where 's your shirt , young man ? " Father asked stiffly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aaron , dear , you know how your Father dislikes having you come to the table without a shirt . " Ordinarily this would have been the signal for Aaron to grumble some excuse and do as he was told . Instead he merely sat there , contemplating his fingernails with masterful indifference to Father 's expanding anger . Then , just as I felt sure Father would explode and we would have a huge scene , Aaron looked up . " I 'm going to become a Sannyasi , " he announced . " My mind 's made up and that 's what I 'm going to be . " - Barney started cackling right off before anyone could say a word , hunching up his narrow shoulders and clapping both hands over his mouth to hold back the laughter . In a way it was fortunate because freckled , toothy , good-natured little Barney was Father 's favorite , and it lent a humorous air to what might have been a serious clash of wills . " Salaam , svami , " Clare said hoarsely , putting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table in a mock version of the way pilgrims pay homage to a holy man , " salaam , ayyar , salaam , salaam . " The butler was convulsed and rushed out onto the veranda to tell the cook and gardener . " Why on earth do you want to be one of those dirty old things ? " Mother asked sympathetically , seeing that Aaron was in a frame of mirtd to be humored . " Surely there are a lot better things still left to try . " She was referring to the many different roles Aaron had already tried during past vacations : blacksmith , potter , musician , farmer , fisherman , laundryman , barber  --  almost every occupation Meigudy offered . The thing about it which impressed me was his love of realism . There was no halfway measure for Aaron He either went all out or not at all . Usually these experiments of his lasted a day . Then he , would grow tired , or disappointed , or he would say it was not what he was looking for . The family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accentuated character traits which hurt no one and so should be tolerated . Of course it frustrated Father terribly , but Mother had persuaded him that the best way to handle Aaron was to laugh and pay no attention . I was more inclined to take him seriously  --  perhaps because Mother always said how much alike he and I were . At any rase , I generally took his side out of a feeling of respect . I mean if he and I really were as much alike as everyone claimed , then it was only logical that I should protect my interests . This idea of becoming a Sannyasi , however , was the first distinctly Hindu role Aaron had played , and I hedged at committing myself one way or the other because it seemed to alter the whole tone of his explorations . All the same I did have to agree there was n't much else left for him to try . " Whether there are or there are n't better things left for him to try , Hazel , " Father said , speaking to Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'll march right up to his room this instant and put on a shirt ! " " Do go along , dear , " Mother coaxed . With an expression of tragic forbearance , Aaron left the table . Mother and Father were both mildly amused , thanks to Barney 's persistent cackling . They might not have been had they known what they were in for . But none of us knew then , and so with considerable peace of mind , Mother crossed off the incident , rang the bell , and chota got under way . Aaron did not come back to the table . He went upstairs all right and we could hear him thumping around opening and closing drawers noisily . When he came down he used the outside stairs , and I saw that he was headed in the direction of the servants ' quarters He had with him a bundle of things and it was a safe guess FIRST VOICE that he was bent on Sannyasi-ing as soon as possible . I wanted to go out and help him get started right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , Samuel , you sit still and finish up . One Sunday morning Sannyasi to a family is enough . " B Y THE time I was allowed to leave the table , Aaron had disappeared , and except for a bundle of his clothes which I found in one of the empty godowns at the servants ' quarters , there was no trace of him . Feeling listless , I wandered about the mission compound looking in all the special places he and T knew . I even took my bicycle and rode for a ways along the Sivaganga Road , which leads out past the Red Lands and the leper hospital . When I could find no trace of Aaron there , I tried the Hindu temple down by the river , and then the mission church , a tall white structure which rises above the huddled thatched roofs of the bazaar section and the market square . No one had seen Aaron . At eleven I returned to the bungalow to join the family for church . Father was pacing the veranda . He had dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he kept pulling his watch out of his shirt pocket , looking at it , and putting it hack again . I leaned my bicycle against the wall and came up to him . " Samuel , " he said , " where 's your brother ? " " I do n't know , sir , " I said . " I 've been looking all over . " " We 'll just have to start without him , Ernest , " Mother said to Father . " Now run along and wash your face , Samuel . " Clare stuck her tongue out at me as I went in to do as I was told because she and Barney were already washed . " Nuts to you , too , " I said . I was really feeling that low about not finding Aaron . After I had washed , I came out on the veranda to wait . There is a solemn air about Sunday morning on the mission compound which is at once both peaceful and depressing . The first bell for church had already rung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procession that would start with the second bell ; and over all there was a sort of baffling hum of whispered voices that seemed to proceed from no particular spot as the girls , dressed in clean bright-colored saris , emerged from their hostel , and the boys stood around clearing their throats on the gravel drive near the community well . Presently the warden blew his whistle and the procession from the boys ' hostel rounded the corner of the bungalow and headed down thedrive toward the main gate . The boys were arranged in pairs according to size and age , the youngest going first , the eldest bringing up the rear with the teachers . Except for one boy wearing khaki shorts , all of them were dressed in white vashtis and pin-striped blue and white short-sleeved shirts with the tails hanging out . As they passed the bungalow , Father and Mother , dressed like an Indian man and woman , marched down the steps to join our head deacon , Mr. Themalan , and the teachers . Clare and Barney hurried after them and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' hostel , the procession waiting there moved ahead to lead the way . If ours had been a Hindu group , the whole thing would have been reversed , with the eldest and most important men going first , the boys coming next , and the women , if they were included at all , bringing up the rear . It was the way the ancient Hindu armies of the Vijayanagara went to battle ; it was the way Hindu families now walked the streets . To me such an arrangement seemed very logical , and I often thought of our Western custom of letting the women go first as arising from some inherent ancestral weakness in the men that required the women to precede them in case any danger lay ahead . Everyone walked in a sort of reverent hush , enforced by the teachers , and the air was filled with the rustling of silk saris and stiff starched vashtis and the padding of bare feet on the ground . All went . well as we crossed the compound , and then at the gate there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " ah-ing " and for some reason the teachers seemed confused as to whether they should call for silence or let the noise continue . Father was already disgruntled by Aaron 's absence , and this undisciplined noisiness made him flush with irritation . Strangely , the excitement did not subside but continued on down the line , like a wave , and as each couple neared the gate , heads leaned forward , eyes turned sharply to the left , and there would be a new murmur of awe and surprise . When our end of the line reached the gate we at last saw what it was all about . There , on the broad stone footing of the gatepost , sat Aaron . He had stripped down to a loin cloth  --  realistically dirty  --  and a rough necklace of prayer beads . Beneath him he had spread a reed mat , and upon this he sat , cross-legged like a stone Buddha , his hands placed palms up on top of each other in his lap , back erect but relaxed , eyes focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body smeared with ashes . He had always been lean and angular , but now , seated in such a position with only a loin cloth on , he looked positively gaunt , as if he had been horn a Sannyasi . I was certainly most impressed , and Father was so flabbergasted that for a moment he could not speak . He and Mr. Themalan and Mother stepped quickly out of line to handle the situation . And of course Clare and Barney and I stood around to see what would happen . " What 's the meaning of this , Aaron ? " Father asked . Aaron remained silent . " Now you answer me , young man ! " Again Aaron would or could not reply . " He is being a Sannyasi , Mr. Fisher , " said Mr. Themalan , " of the sort that wo n't talk . " At that moment the second bell , which was late , began tolling from the bazaar , and listening to it , I had the dreadful feeling that Aaron  --  the Aaron I knew  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threatening confidence that made Father jerk around and look at me . " We 'll see about that , " he said . " Aaron , dear , " Mother said , squatting down beside him and touching his arm , " do get up . It 's time for church . " There was still no indication that Aaron had heard or was even aware of us . I really had to hand it to him . He was determined  --  much snore so than Father , whose indignation was tempered with surprise and indecision . I honestly do n't believe he had expected Aaron to go this far . It had the effect of catching him off-guard because dealing with something like this was outside his frame of reference and there were no rules to guide him . " I 'll not have my eldest son making a fool of himself and the entire mission , " he started to shout , letting his voice dwindle to a hoarse whisper . " Get up this instant , do you hear , boy ! " For all of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron to rise , while the procession slowly came to a halt out of curiosity . Through it all Aaron sat , steadfast as a rock , without blinking or flinching or shifting-the focus of his eyes from the tip of his nose . Even Father 's efforts to budge him met with no success . Aaron was so relaxed that it was impossible to pick him up , and Father had to call the gateman . The gateman , however , refused to co-operate or in any way be induced to touch Aaron , saying that if the Chinna Doraiwas bent upon becoming a Sannyasi , it must be an act of the gods , and who was a humble gate-man to interfere ? Father turned to Mr. Themalan . " Give a hand here , wo n't you ? " The Deacon blinked but did not move . " Why not let him be ? " he said . " He causes no harm . If you move him he will only be angry and return when you leave . " Mother expressed much the same opinion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be wanting to try something else this afternoon . Moving him now might make him do worse , and here at least the gateman can keep an eye on him . " T HERE were a lot of Hindu people standing on the other side of the road watching , and their presence made Father too embarrassed to risk any further action in his good clothes . Unwillingly he had to admit temporary defeat . He had been challenged and humiliated in front of the entire mission , and he spoke sharply as he turned and shooed us along to church . I was so impressed with Aaron 's performance that I had trouble during the sermon keeping my attention on what I was doing and lost three games of short straws to one of the robber caste boys sitting next to me . After the service was over , I hooked it back the short way to the compound as fast as I could . Aaron was still sitting in the exact same position , only there was one significant change : someone had placed an offering of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumpkin flower on the ground before him , and in his clay begging howl a mess of cooked rice and curds was collecting flies and drying in the sun . The gateman had come out of the reading room and opened the gates for the procession 's return . He saluted me as " Chinna Vellai Svami , " or little white god , implying that Aaron was the big white god . I accepted his salute and asked him how the offerings got there , and he said the limes were for Aaron 's victory over Father and the mission , the cow-dung and pumpkin flower to protect him from future disturbances , and the rice and curds from a young mother across the street whose baby had been vomiting for three days and had stopped being sick the moment the white Sannyasi had appeared at the gate . When Father returned with the procession from church and saw Aaron still there , he turned his head the other way and marched by . The schoolchildren did not exclaim this time , but some of the more serious-minded ventured a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this seemed to touch my brother . It was as if by some miracle he had succeeded , or was in the process of succeeding , to retreat within himself to some other abode of such great calm that nothing could disturb him . I hung around to watch a while , and at lunch time I went back to the bungalow . It was generally agreed that heat and hunger would impose a natural limit to Aaron 's experiment , and that his endurance would fade in time for lunch . Mother even ordered the servants to hold up the meal until Aaron came back so we could eat together the way Father liked . But by two o'clock her self-confidence had worn a little thin . Barney was getting fussy , Clare had robbed the meat safe , the servants were complaining , and Father 's stomach was rumbling loudly . It was therefore unanimously agreed that we should eat without Aaron . " Well , " said Mother , " I 'm sure he 'll be along any minute . " And we sat down to luncheon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided a servant should be sent to summon him . Accordingly the butler was dispatched . He returned without Aaron , but there was a sort of misty religious look on his face . " Amma , " he said , with something like reverence in his voice , " the Svami can not be ap-proached . " Mother nodded , almost as if she had expected that reply , and Father got up from the table without folding his napkin . Barney was sent up for his nap , Clare went to her room to read detective stories , and Mother lay down on the wicker cot under the fan because she was getting another of her migraines . Consequently I was left alone . There is nothing worse than being left alone in a bungalow during the hot part of the day . The servants close all the downstairs shutters and doors to keep out the heat , and the rooms are filled with a sort of dismal , sticky twilight . After a bit of wandering around , I pulled on my sandals and opened one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with a cough syrup bottle full of raw coconut oil . " Take this to Aaron , " she said , " and see that he rubs it on his shoulders . " I stuck the bottle in my hip pocket and went out into the blinding heat . News of Aaron 's victory over Father and his purported cure of the sick baby had spread , and when I reached the gate I saw that more offerings had been placed on the mat in front of him . I supposed they were due to new reports of miraculous cures , but I did n't find out for sure because the gateman was sleeping in the shade of the reading room with his khaki turban pulled down over his face . I touched Aaron on the head . " Here 's some oil , " I said . " Mother wants you to rub it on your shoulders . " Aaron sat like a stone upon a stone , exuding heat and smelling strongly of dried sweat . It was much too hot to be about and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flies . I stood holding out the bottle for a while . Then with a shrug I squatted beside him and began rubbing him with the oil . His skin had always been deeply tanned . Even so there were spots along his shoulders , chest , and forearms which I knew were so sensitive with burns that if they had been on me I would have howled . But Aaron 's eyes never moved , and the slow , almost indistinguishable rhythm of his breathing remained unchanged . I was truly awed . The butler had brought lunch out to Aaron on a tray , and after I had finished rubbing on the oil , I said , " You ought to eat your lunch Aaron . " Again he did not reply , so I thought I ought to put some of it into his mouth . I lifted the brass tumbler to his lips and it was like trying to make a statue drink . His lips remained slightly parted , but the water all ran out the corners of his mouth and clown his chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't even , look at me . I was fixing to go home at this point , but with nothing else to do I decided to stay around and brush the flies from his face . In his previous experiments he had never been quite so realistic and determined as this . I had the feeling as I sat there fanning him for the next two hours that perhaps I had been a witness to a long train of fruitless searching , that here at last the search had met with success , and that somehow Aaron had stumbled upon a vast and irresistible wilderness which he was in the process of exploring . It was only a feeling on my part , and it made me uncomfortable . I did n't like to think of my brother as being serious about this . I was n't surprised or annoyed or anything like that  --  just upset in a peculiar way that made my own life seem inadequate . I felt this most keenly when , after an hour , a woman came out of one of the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suspicious of me , bowed low , salaamed , as Clare had done earlier , placed a lime on the mat and hurried away . I DID N'T try to talk to Aaron after that . When I was sick of fanning him I went home . News had spread across the compound of course , and at the boys ' hostel where I go every afternoon in the cooler hours to play soccer and valley ball , the boys did n't want to play but crowded around as some of the teachers cornered me and began asking questions about Aaron . Was it true he had cured the sick ? Hadhe been told in a vision to become a Sannyasi ? And what was this strange power that could make him become so perfectly withdrawn that even the Peria Dorai could not rouse him ? I had no answers for them . I had not expected everyone to he so interested in Aaron 's experiment . His previous efforts had had little effect on the mission community . He was admired locally for his clever sense of humor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone as being something more than an act . It seemed to scratch beneath the superficial calm of our well-organized Christian community and reveal in the raw the centuries of environmental influence which was , after all , basically Hindu . Any vestige or semblance of toleration vanished when Aaron did not come home for supper . Mother waited the meal again , but for a shorter time . ? T was going through Aaron 's things , " she said when we were seated at the table , " and I found this . " She handed an old leather-bound booklet over to Father , who opened it and began leafing through the pages of Tamil script illustrated with ink drawings on how to become a yogi . " It 's a book on Yogasanam , " Father said . " I know , " Mother said . " And I 've been thinking . . . about Aaron 's being late for breakfast this morning ... the way he 's been staying up at night . .. his careful sense of timing in all this . .. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hazel ? " Father asked . " How else do you explain the peculiar trance he has achieved ... ? and that book ... ? " " I do n't know , Hazel , " Father said . " Perhaps he has an accomplice . " Mother pressed her fingers against her forehead and looked at her plate . " I 'm afraid , Ernest , " she said . " I 'm afraid it 's far worse than that . " We ate grimly and silently . After the meal was over , Mother and Father walked out into the night to see Aaron . Father carried the lantern , and Clare and Barney walked directly behind him . The shadows of their legs in the lamplight stretched away monstrous and ghostlike against the darkness . The purpose of our excursion was quite evident to everyone , and the schoolchildren who had been watching us all day long to see what we would do , now came to the windows and doors of every building . I had the feeling that even the trees and the walls were capped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father set the lantern down beside Aaron . He stood there looking at him for a moment . " Well , " he said after a while , " do you plan on coming in ? " " Listen , Aaron , " Mother said , seeing that Aaron was not going to talk even though it was dark , " this has really gone on quite long enough . It 's not healthy for you to be out here . If you want to be a Sannyasi , why do n't you come back and do it at the bungalow ? " I stood around watching while Mother and Father wheedled and cajoled and pleaded with Aaron  --  all to no avail . " Very well then , " Father said , " we 'll have to carry him back . " They tried picking him up , but apparently someone other than myself had oiled him recently with an oil that was so slippery that neither of my parents could get a grip . Angrily Father took out his pocket knife and cut a little switch from a nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Aaron . " For the last time I 'm telling you to get up . " Mother turned to us . " Go back to the bungalow , children , " she said . " This is n't good for you to watch . " We started to retreat and then stopped abruptly at the first whistling smack of the switch on Aaron 's back . " Get up , " Father said grimly , and again his arm rose and with a whistling smack the switch descended . For a few awful moments the strokes began getting harder and faster as Father 's anger mounted to frenzy and he seemed to lose control of himself . Then suddenly Mother was throwing herself in the way and grabbing at Father 's arm . " Ernest ! Ernest ! " she kept crying . " For heaven 's sake stop it ! What 's the matter with you ? " There was a long pause as my parents stood looking at each other . Then Father dropped the stick . " What am I going to do , Hazel ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mother kept shaking her head from side to side with her hands over her face . " Not here , not like this , not in front of the children , " she said , as if to herself . Then taking a deep breath , she straightened her shoulders and looked at Father . " Pull yourself together , Ernest , " she said . " You 've got to pull yourself together . " She began talking rapidly . " There 's only one thing to do , and that 's to let him work it out of his system . We ca n't drag him home , and certainly the servants wo n't touch him . Even if we could find someone to help , ft 's plain Aaron has his mind set on this . He 'll only come back out . As for food , someone else has already seen to that . " The thought of the offerings in front of Aaron made her weep a little . " What if he stays out here ? " Father asked in a shaking voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now Ernest , " Mother said comfortingly , " I 'm sure we 're doing too much worrying about this . Just let him work it out of his system . A few days and nights of it and he 'll he back . I 'm sure of it , Ernest . You 'll see . " C ON TRARY to Mother 's prediction , Aaron did not come hack after a few days and nights of it . Instead someone built a thatch lean-to over him and his shrine became established , the ground in front of him swept clean , moistened with cow-dung solution , and decorated with a design drawn with powdered lime . Three times a day the butler brought food out to him . Aaron never touched it during the light hours , nor did he alter his position . But somehow every morning part of the food would be gone , the water glass would be empty , and his body would he clean , oiled , and ready for another day . As far as I could discover , someone had appointed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers saw us make nightly trips out to the gate , and invariably we returned without Aaron . Every time we went out there to see him , and every time we returned to the bungalow empty-handed , the will to act died in my parents . Aaron thus experienced victory after victory , perhaps unknowingly . It had the effect of making his will seem strong , and his reputation ceased to be purely local . In fact his reputation grew to such an extent that the one time Father tried to have him forcibly removed to the bungalow , a large throng quickly gathered in the streets to protest . Even the Christian population joined together and signed a petition requesting Father to leL the white Sannyasi alone . And so for the next two months Aaron sat out there  --  through Christmas and New Year 's , and through all kinds of weather . His young beard grew out scraggly , his flesh turned a deep chocolate , and his hair became long and ragged and reddish-brown with dust . It was impossible for us , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation . Father 's determination and aggressiveness had been revised out of existence , and he seemed to wander about from one task to another in an empty , forgetful frame of mind . Mother , on the other hand , lingered for a long time on the verge of nervous collapse . She refused to lose faith in Aaron 's sanity , and yet the shock of it had opened up great cracks in the foundation of her faith . As a result her mind was ground out to a sharp , biting edge and she was unusually abrupt with everyone . My parents often talked in the living-room long after midnight . They had already canceled all their tours and stayed away from mission meetings in Mathurai for shame . And at night they would simply talk , talk of doing one thing or another , of taking drastic action , of having Aaron secretly brought hack to the bungalow , of calling in doctors and police . But the anxiety which prompted such discussions stemmed from indecision . It was a vicious circle that tied a knot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about our business with an air of futility because none of us could put Aaron from mind . It was as if by chalice he had stumbled upon something that answered an urgent need basic to him , and in the process of fulfilling it he was destroying us bit by hit , as each day the family crisis deepened . The indecision did not stop with the family . In its own insidious way it undermined the very foundations of the mission . There was nothing you could put a finger on ; for externally at least life went on the same as ever ; only it was not the same . My parents ' listlessness extended to the school like a creeping paralysis , and everything changed subtly , by imperceptible degrees , and became slower . I could feel it  --  we could all feel it . We seemed to be standing on the rim of a great precipice , and at any moment that rim would crumble and fall away , and there was nothing anyone could do about it because we were all held to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I THINK Aaron may have sensed this . At any rate if he did not , then I can offer no explanation for what subsequently happened : in the second week of January he finally gave up . Having found what must have been an answer for him , having beaten us and surmounted all obstacles to reach some distant goal in the wilderness , he gave it up and came back , and I can only think that he did so out of generosity , sensing what we must he going through . It was past midnight and we all were in bed and , I suppose , asleep . I was awakened by the sound of footsteps climbing the back stairs through the door Mother had kept unlocked ever since Aaron stayed away , that first night . And then , framed against the lighter darkness of the sky , Aaron appeared on the edge of the veranda . He came slowly across to his bed , and for several moments he stood looking down at it , shaking his head . It had been waiting , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net and lay down . I knew it was not my business to move or CO say anything . It was his fight and he had the right to speak when he wanted to . But curiosity got the better of me . " Well , " I asked , anxious to hear him say something , anything , " what did you learn ? " During all these past days he had not used his voice , and I could tell by the way his hands now gripped the white-painted iron bed posts that he was struggling to communicate with me , struggling to speak , to tell me what was tearing him apart inside . After a long while he finally managed to find his voice , and the sound of it , ripping , bursting up from his lungs was like the sharp , anguished wail of a new-born child . " Do n't ask ! " he cried , " do n't ask ! " I waited patiently for him , thinking that in his own good time he would enlarge on the subject . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night and looking up at the deep impenetrable darkness of the sky that , with the moist and yielding earth below , formed our common womb . I wondered how it must have been for him out there alone night after night , fighting for something that could never really be his because he was only born in the East , and not of it . And then for the first time I began sensing how beaten he must feel at this very moment  --  not victorious as we had all thought , but so beaten that he could n't even cry . He had searched diligently  --  the hard way  --  for his answer , and found that ultimately there was no answer but the inward peace of a child in the womb , of the body in the grave ; and having found that , having loosed the silver cord , having fought fiercely toward a horizon and goal that kept receding , he had at last been forced to give it up for us , We were the alien link in this country , the alien link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For us he had been reborn , and the tears were not mine but his . I could only feel a deep and painful sympathy for him , mingled with the joy of knowing he was back . Finally 1 got up . I lifted the mosquito netting and walked barefoot across the now cool cement floor of the veranda , through the black and empty rooms of the bungalow that would someday join the ranks of crumbling and forgotten buildings , to the front veranda where my parents ' bed , isolated in its maternal shroud of netting , loomed pale and ghostly in the night .
