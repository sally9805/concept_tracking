txt The Senate approved a freeze of farm price supports at 1957 levels , but by a margin ? 5043 ? that practically kills the hope of , overriding an almost certain Presidential veto . Then , by the same vote margin , the Senate rejected a separate measure which , aimed to freeze only dairy props and was designed to get around a veto . Earlier yesterday , Agriculture Secretary Benson told a news conference : " It Would seem to me that this legislation , if passed in its present form , is almokt certain to face a veto . " The farm chief called the measure " even worse than that misbegotten , hodgepodge farm bill that the President vetoed in 1956 . " The general price-prop freeze missed by 12 votes the necessary two-thirds " margin that would be necessary to nullify a veto , assuming that the lineup of Senators would be unchanged in a vote to override . The overall measure goes to the House , where Chairman Cooley ( D. , N.C. ) of the Agriculture Committee perdictedi a good chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of the general freeze came after five hours of debate , punctuated frequently by sallies against . Mr. Benson . The Senate measure is designed to nullify indefinitely announced cuts in mice supports on some commodities . For example , it would hold milk supports at $3.25 a hundredweight , instead of $3.03 under announced Agriculture Department plans : butterfat , at 58.6 cents a pound instead of 54.2 cents ; wheat , $2 a bushel instead of $1.78 ; rice at $4.72 a hundredweight instead of $443 ; and barley , at 95 cents a bushel instead of 93 cents . Secretary Benson 's attack on the freeze riled anew his critics on Capitol Hill , with Chairman Ellender ( D. , La. ) of the Senate Agriculture Committee retorting : " I have no doubt but that the gold dust twins of lower price supports will march down the same alley . " Capitol Hill Critics Riled Sen. Ellender end another committee member , Sen. Humphrey ( D. , Minn. ) kept up the oft repeated theme that the price freeze is emergency , anti recession legislation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " general depressed state of the national economy " with net farm income " at the lowest point since 1942 . " Mr. Humphrey accused Mr : Benson of a " planned recession for farmers . " The Senate bills , he declared , would prevent the farm secretary frets " aiding and abetting a recession . " Sen. Young ( D. , N. D. ) declared , " it seems almost ridiculous for one Cabinet member in this Administration . Secretary Benson , ? to propose lower prices and less purchasing power for the farmers at a time when the wages of labor are increasing and while other Cabinet members are ' planning multi-billion dollar spending programs to provide employ . ment for the unemployed . " He added lower dairy price supports proposed by Mr. Benson are " very unlikely to be passed on in lower prices to the consumers . " The Senate 's action in voting down the separate dairy hill came in a break-up of the farm bloc , with dairy-state lawmakers unable to muster support from other farm state Senators , particularly southerners.l They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze would not be vetoed . Sen. Russell ( D. , Ga. ) , leading the group of southern Senators who provided the margin of defeat , asserted a separate bill would " split the farm bloc into pieces . " Sen. Dirksen ( R. , wild has been working closely with the Administration , also gave a strong hint of the fate awaiting the support freeze . " I think the beat service the President can do to American agriculture , " he said , " Is to veto the handiwork of this afternoon . " " Very Serious Mist/tire " Secretarr'Benson echoed this view in his prqss conference , when he called the freeze " a very serious mistake . . . " and said it would " . . . hurt farmers . .. be , bad for the nation . . . and would move us backward at a time when we ought to be moving forward . " He found one supporter for this argument in the Senate . Sen. Hickenlooper ( R. , Iowa ) said : " We are beginning to lick this program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be set backwards . " ' The Secretary made it clear to reporters he rejects the view that the measure would help combat the business slump by putting more money into the farmer 's pocket . " A fredze would not help agriculture and it would not serve as the means of any antirecession effort , " Mr. Benson declared . " As ill matter of fact , it would have a reverse effect . You ca n't freeze agriculture and have it move forward . You must move away from Government control and fixing of prices . " Mr. Benson also argued a freeze " would be unfair to winter wheat growers who signed up in the 1958 acreage reserve phase of the soil bank . " He said they might have made a different decision about banking their land in return for Federal payments if they had known Congress would , try to keep wheat props from dropping from $2 a bushel last year 's level , to the $1.78 proclaimed for 1958 . Mr. Benson said a freeze would " ignore most of the sound recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm laws . Mr. Eisenhower has asked Congress to lower support floors on major crops , abolish the legal formulas which push supports up when surpluses are whittled down , and give the agriculture secretary discretionary power to boost acreage allotments on major crops .
