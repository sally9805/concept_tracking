<P> The 112-man airborne rebellion against Nicaragua 's Somoza brothers-President Luis and National Guard Commander Anastasio-fizzled toward failure last week . <P> The collapse was plain the first time a U.S. newsman made contact with the rebels . As TIME 'S Mexico City Bureau Chief Harvey Rosenhouse walked toward a farmhouse in the jungled hills 90 miles east of Managua , he was met by Lawyer Jos Medina Cuadra , 30 , leader of a group of 45 rebels . He and his troops , said Medina , were disheartened : " Our radio went dead . We were always short of food , and the peasants in these mountains do not have enough to spare . " Medina was ready to give up . Rosenhouse sent a twelve-year-old boy to a nearby National Guard command post with a message on one of his calling cards : " Forty-five rebels want to surrender . They have laid down their guns . Please do n't come in shooting . " A Guard patrol surrounded the house , took the surrender . Three days later Medina 's holdout leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prensa , also gave himself up . That left 38 rebels still at large , scattered through the hills near the Olama River 65 miles northeast of Managua . <P> The rebels had overestimated their own toughness and underestimated the Somoza boys ' strength , which included a well trained and loyal army , reliable reservists , and the neutrality of the urban and rural masses . Most Nicaraguans apparently are not interested in overthrowing President Luis , who has been liberalizing the dictatorship he inherited from his assassinated father , tough old Anastasio ( " Tacho " ) Somoza.
