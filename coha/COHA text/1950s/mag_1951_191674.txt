For the past 162 years , France has been trying to digest the French Revolution which other nations have assimilated with less difficulty . If the decay of pre-Revolutionary France had been as deep as most 19th Century historians said it was , France 's problem would not have arisen . The truth was that the Revolution was made against one of the most successful social structures the world ever saw , still near the height of its vigor at the moment it was attacked . Only the most powerful revolutionary drive could have breached that structure , only the massive vigor of the pre-Revolutionary French tradition could have survived that revolutionary thrust . <P> Not even the Terror could sweep the men , ideas and institutions of the French past into a forgotten dust heap . The French Revolution , unlike the American and Russian Revolutions , was not left to work out its destiny in remote solitude . France 's pre-Revolutionary success had made it the center of the world . What happened at the center concerned all . Within the souls of Frenchmen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted . The tumult of the irresistible crunching against the immovable made constructive thought impossible . <P> Most revolutions reach a period of calm : power has been grasped , principles ( or slogans ) accepted . What remains is the quiet and critical work of constructing the political institutions through which the power can be exercised in accordance with the new principles . The French Revolution never reached an adequate period of calm . It was preoccupied with immediate action when it needed time for consolidation . The literature of the American Revolution is constitutional philosophy ( e.g. , The Federalist ) ; the literature of the French Revolution is the oratory of action ( e.g. , Danton 's " toujours de l'audace " ) . <P> The Great Weakness . Thus in the formative years of modern France a pattern was set that persisted into the relatively calm decades ; even when they had time , Frenchmen did not concentrate on political institutions . They could , and did , think seriously on the lofty level of eternal verities in the relation of man and society , tapping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or they could , and usually did , conduct their politics in terms of the expediency of the moment , carelessly altering and confusing their political institutions to conform to fitful winds . Modern France always takes itself seriously . It sometimes takes its leaders seriously . It never takes its constitutions seriously . <P> This accounts for the fact that the French who-with much justice-consider themselves the wisest and most mature exemplars of Western civilization , nevertheless appear in their political aspect as frivolous and immature . This was the great weakness of France during the Revolution , through the 19th Century , and is its great weakness today .
