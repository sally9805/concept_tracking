In Los Angeles , Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz last week put their signatures on one of the biggest TV contracts ever written . For $8,000,000 , to be paid them by CBS and Sponsor Philip Morris cigarettes , Lucille and Desi agreed to give their top-rated I Love Lucy show weekly for the next 2 years , the production expenses to be paid by them . Besides the money , they keep all the rights in their films , which had a higher Nielsen rating ( 71.7% ) than the TV coverage of President Eisenhower 's inauguration ( 67.6% ) . Said Lucille happily : " It could n't happen to a nicer pair of kids-I mean our two children , of course . "
