The Sixth Grade Takes to the Woods Here 's education with a fresh approach  --  a week in the wilds for an entire class . The kids learn things they never get from hooks , and even the teacher has fun . By Jerome Ellison . Dear Mom : Yesterday we went panning for gold , and found some . " From a grown son seeking his fortune in some far-off wild ? Nothing so bizarre ; its from the midweek letter of a twelve-year-old on safari , with his whole sixth-grade class , fifty miles from his Indianapolis home . The full-week grade-school campout has come to be quite a thing in our urban public schools . The idea originated in Michigan twenty years ago , and had a slow , steady growth for its first decade . By 1950 , fifteen states , including populous New York , Massachusetts , Ohio and Illinois , had school camping . Now over half the states go along with the idea and nobody seems to know where it will stop . Last year California alone took 29,000 youngsters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few more years , West Coast school men say , half the state 's children will be included . In Indiana , one of the pioneer school-camping states and the scene of the present inquiry , the idea is considered past the experimental stage . It is here , they assure you , to stay . When you ask school people what good it does , they say , " It is an experience . " When you want to know what kind , they say , well , it is an experience that brings classroom theory to life . Arithmetic , for example , takes on a more vivid meaning when it 's applied to banking and budgeting for an exciting trip . Lectures on the constellations are not so remote when you can tip your head back and look at them through clear air and a deep woodland silence . Nature study perks up , once you 've stumbled , popeyed , upon the spectacle of a snake swallowing a frog . Citizenship is more than just a word , after you and twenty classmates have taken care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter spent the better part of a month , off and on , among fifth- and sixth-grade campers at fabulous Bradford Woods , a 2300-acre woodland tract an hour 's drive southwest of Indianapolis . An experience must , after all , be experienced . So come along and share one , with the teachers and kids , the staff and parents , of McKinley School , P.S. 39 , Indianapolis . On the Monday morning of departure , everybody is present , and punctual . For half an hour before school time , parents of sixth-graders , conspicuous for the burdens they carry , have been converging on the school grounds . Their bags , suitcases and bundles contain the ( Continued on Page 65 ) required items for each child : blankets , sheets , pillow ; underwear , socks , jeans , shirts ; sweater , jacket , raincoat , boots ; pajamas , robe , slippers ; tooth brush , handkerchiefs , flashlight , towels . This gear accumulates in a great pile hack of the school building . Presently , men begin loading it onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ) the pupils wait with a vast expectancy . Looking over the rooms , you pick out faces . The pudgy , oversize boy with freckles , you think , may have the makings of a bully . There is a pale , blond lad , too thin , patently unsure of himself . Faces , faces  --  thin , fat , round , long  --  all of them , on this morning , shining with anticipation . Outside , mothers and fathers are waiting in a little cluster . At last it is time . The children burst upon the outdoors with a cheer , there arc smiles and waves of the hand , and more than one misty eye . The children board the two yellow school buses and the little motorcade moves onto the road  --  the board-of-education station wagon in the lead , then the yellow buses , then the truck , then two passenger cars of teachers . On the bus , the children carry out a geography project . It is a fine morning , bright , but made mysterious , once we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillsides and fog on the meadows . The teat , the teacher says , is the out-of-doors . Do you see two methods of transportation between Indianapolis and Mooresville ? Three ? Four ? Not long ago we turned off Route 40 , also called the National Road . It goes from coast to coast , and once had stagecoaches on it . What caused the gullies on the right ? Now we arc crossing the White River , West Fork . Where does the East Fork go ? Miles away at camp , a small staff has been busy all weekend . Bob Tully , in charge for Indiana University , which holds the land as a trust , has seen that the five winterized buildings  --  four cabins , each big enough for eighteen youngsters and two counselors , and a dining hall that can seat 120 ? have been made snug . Cooks from the Indianapolis school-cafeteria system have made things ready in the kitchen for the sixty-nine youngsters and seven teachers now en route . Maud Hamilton , the P.S. 39 nurse , has opened the infirmary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on call . Anticipation mounts as the buses draw closer . Campers have heard stories from prior explorers  --  tales of captured skunks and pet snakes and gold in the streams , and of the weird nocturnal doings of the newts and owls . What if we should catch a raccoon , and tame him ? The buses leave the highway , bounce along a gravel road that skirts a meadow for a quarter mile , then turns sharply up a wooded hill and terminates in a circle at a cluster of frame buildings . The campers arrive , big-eyed . Men and boys unload the gear , teachers assign cabins and cots . The first day is mostly setting up housekeeping  --  unpack , make beds , schedule chores , find out where things are , try out one or two of the shorter trails . One group discovers the kiln in the basement of the dining hail where the fine pottery clay from the creek banks may be fired . Another takes the trail to the woodland chapel . A work unit gathers logs and tinder for a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will gather round to sec it lighted , and this will be a time to remember . Next day camping begins in earnest . Rise and shine at 6:45 . A color guard raises the flag at 7:15 while campers pledge allegiance to it , and to the country for which it stands . Breakfast is at 7:30 , clean-up at 8 , inspection at 8:30 . At it quarter of nine . campers gather at the dining hall for morning assignments . Study and exploration jaunts were conducted on schedule . The sixty-nine from No.39 were divided into four groups which took turns working through a standard list of assignmentS . While Group 1 was doing the sand-pit trail , Group II was hiking to the fungus bog , then the next day they 'd switch , so at the end of the week everybody had done everything . One trip was to gather supplies for handcrafts : reecll , grasses and bark for baskets and mats , clay for pots and vases , gay stones for necklaces and bracelets . Another was panning for gold . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rush to Indiana . A strong man panning from sunup to sundown might clear five 63 dollars a week . Mineral-minded boys , though , find a rare thrill in isolating a flake or two . One standard hike is a geology trip with the science consultant , Dr. Newton Sprague  --  which of these rocks came with the glacier , which have always been here ? There 's a trip to learn cruising by corn-pass , and how to make a map . Trees , birds , animals , reptiles and insects are identified on a nature hike . State conservation officers arrive one day to demonstrate firearms safety and forest-fire control . As part of the latter exercise , the ' boy campers cut , sweep and rake a fire block through two hundred feet of woods . There is .1 natural tendency for things to happen ' Alien children and nature confront each other . There was , on one camp-out , the business of the canteens . These accessories are considered romantic by campers but a nuisance by camp directors . One day there was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its owner did not share its contents . When he left it unguarded , another boy seized it and drank rascnously . Ile quickly put it down and cried , " I felt a lump go down my throat ! " The owner of the canteen rushed to the scene , look a quick look , and angrily exclaimed , " You swallowed my salaman-der ! " School authorities do not advocate campouts just because they 're fun Wilbur Young , Indiana 's state school superintendent . points out that educators have long known thiit classrooms . Ihimgh handy for dealing with large numbers , are a " sonless hat artilkial " teaching device . When skills can be applied to actual situations , as in camp , attending school becomes not only " preparation for life " but experience in living , And so , all through the week , McKinley School pupils were mindful that , though this was camp , it was 11150 school . George Sprague , the principal  --  not related to the science consultant , Newton Sprague  --  who smiled a benevolent farewell at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how things were going . Paul Johnson , assistant superintendent of Indianapolis schools , was present with a word of encouragement at lunch one day . George Farkas , physical-education supervisor for the central school system , in over-all charge of camping , was on hand every day , as were Bob Tully and nurse Hamilton . Steve Geisha-. physical-education consultant , was in administrative charge and Ted Van Voorhees , arts-and-crafts consultant , contributed advice in his specialty . The classroom teachers  --  Mrs. Louise Schaekel , Mrs. Rena Powell , Mr. Ray Alto and Mr. Tom Cross  --  were present twenty-four hours a day . Even with plenty of staff , watching that many youngsters calls for vigilance , and the teachers had firm safety rules . Noses were counted at the beginning of each hike , at each discussion stop en route , and on return to camp . Teachers always brought up the rear , rounding up stragglers . No running was allowed . Explorers were warned to keep the streams in sight ; allof them , if followed downstream , intersected main highways after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foliage were to be plucked , tasted or eaten  --  not even salamanders  --  except on instructions given at the start of the trip . One time , in another state , a young teacher had decorated a camp dining hall with " beautiful autumn foliage " ? poison sumac . She lost three weeks of school , but the incident has become a legend , and a warning . After morning assignments , which occupy campers until eleven , there 's free time until 12:30 lunch . Meals were agreeable occasions . I recall one with particular pleasure . it consisted of a meat-sauce preparation called " barbecue , " baked beans , jelly , cookies , bread , butter and milk . It was courteously passed by my table 's twelve-year-old hostess , Julie , after grace had been sung . She put me at my ease and entertained me pith small talk  --  you 're supposed to brush up on your table manners while at camp . Service is taken care of by technicians known as " hoppers " and " scrapers , " who arc chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scraper scrapes and stacks the dishes and delivers them to the kitchen stair for washing . Our hopper and scraper that day were two energetic boys named Warren and Howard . here 's a postprandial rest until 2:15 , when afternoon assignments begin . The theme of applying textbook information to camp situations continues . For example , in social studies , the question " How would you make a living in a wilderness like this ? " prepares the way for a discussion of how the first settlers made out , and points up the current problems of the farmer . Observing a growing gully on land they 've come to love is a lesson in soil conservation that sticks . A brush dam is thrown up with quick indignation , and perhaps some pine seedlings are planted . Botany really comes alive with the marvelous sassafras , whose hark provides raw materials for mats and baskets and whose roots yield a wonderful tea . Even arithmetic is less formidable when you use it to set a compass course over uncharted ground , or figure boss many oak trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson will be derived from winding up the campers ' financing on their return . rhe P.T.A . advanced 5408 to pupils who could n't get up their twelve dollars right away  --  about half the total . It was all paid back , one dollar a week , from allowances or earnings from baby sitting and lawn chores . Problem : How much would have to be paid back if  --  which it did n't  --  the P.T.A . charged ft per cent interest ? Chemistry and geology have a new interest when connected with the strange fossils and bright stones picked up on a hike . Personal hygiene is more easily taught when pupils can see , by looking at each other , the importance of a shower after a hard day in the woods . Group living inexorably teaches the rudiments of law and civil government . When Rude Rudolf 's gear encroaches on the cabin space of his neighbor , and his poor inspection mark pulls the cabin 's average down to third place . he hears from his fellow citizens . Learning about the industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp was located became a social-studies project . Here , in the old days , the Miami Indians hunted and fished . Black walnut , for paneling and army gunstocks , has long come from this part of the country , along with oak flooring and hickory handles . The Bradford family settled here in 1858. and the three bachelor sons . John . Perry and Albert , discovered the molding sand , later widely used in foundries , which made them wealthy . In 1937 John . the last of the brothers , bequeathed the property , 2300 acres . to Indiana University and the James Whitcomb Riley Memorial Hospital for crippled children . The camp 's box trap , wire mesh on a tooth-scarred wooden frame , is more famous for its escapers than for its catches . But it teaches valuable lessons in zoology . Once it caught a raccoon which , when released , would n't go home , but became a pet and begged for food every day until the campers departed . When it catches a chipmunk or squirrel there 's not much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out , The campers always catch something with hats , nets or bare hands . During our week a green snake , a small unidentified reptile and some tree frogs were captured , sheltered and admired . Afternoon assignments take until 4:30 , when everybody takes a shower . At 5:2S , with all present . the color guard respectfully lowers the flag . Dinner is at 5:30 , There 's an hour to write home , listen to records or finish assignments , and an hour around the roaring campfire . Back to cabins at 8:30 , then a bedtime snack , then , at 9 , lights out . The long , brassy notes of taps echo over the hills at 9:05 , and the campers ' day is ended . Toward the end of the week , pupils are asked to write their " evaluations " of the whole business . A special piquancy is imparted to these observations by th : sixth-grader 's characteristic capriciousness of spelling and phrasing .. " If ofered the chance , he or she would bedaiscndu.t to turn it down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You learn instermg things to do . " Some singled out items for special appreciation : " I like the little chaple where you can sit and listen to the wood sounds " ; " Our nurse does a swell job repairing . " There is an unmistakable note of approval in the essays : " Myself I would like you to know that 1 love this camp " ; " The most wonderful thing of all is the camp fire . " Teachers ' judgments confirm the children 's , though for other reasons . " Remember the thin little fellow who seemed kind of out of things ? " Ray Atto said to me when I returned to school for a post-camp checkup . " At camp he really came into his own , and has been going great guns ever since , " The lad was a farm boy , new to the city and its ways . In town , the class , with the unkindness children sometimes show , had sensed his uncertainty and kept him off balance . In camp he was the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new respect . He was the one who picked up the green snake and fed it when the coethoctersd.all ran , squealing . Now he is ac- The pudgy , freckled boy with bullying tendencies had an opposite but equally beneficial experience . When he proved to be short of ( Continued on Page 68 ) Conthortriffrarri Page 64 ) wind on the hills , lagging on the hikes and sloppy in the cabin , his once easy prestige waned . Now he had to work fur recognition or go without it . To his credit , he tried . This development of sounder character appraisal during campout is widely observed . One teacher reported , " We all felt that children in our group matured more in one week at camp than would be possible in a month in the classroom . " By maturing , the teachers specifically mentioned progress in table manners , general courtesy and friendliness , and a greater willingness to pitch in and help for the sake of the group , as well as improvement in executing textbook assignments . In a camp where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.S. 39 hunch at Camp Riley  --  there is actually a rivalry for the kitchen-police jobs , hopper and scraper . Cots are made and quarters tidied with a zest , spurred by competition with rival cabins . Amazed parents have reported that camp attitudes endure  --  at least in some cases , and at least for a time  --  after the kids conic home . One said , typically , " Why , he 'd never pick up his clothes or wash a dish except on dire threat . Now he 's really helpful , and almost neat ! " Some weeks after it was all over , 1 paid a follow-up call on McKinley School Principal Sprague . " We 've had a wonderful school year , " he said , " and I think the campout helped to make it so . " When asked for a definition he said a wonderful school year was a year when teachers and pupils like one another and get along well , when the faculty is reasonably harmonious and enjoying its work , when the P.T.A . is clicking and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At camp , children get to know their teachers for the first time as people . From then on , they 're more at ease with one another . " Principal Sprague is so pleased about what camping has done for schooling that he wants it every spring and fall . Sprague 's Thirty-niners ca n't soon go back to Camp Riley . " There are eighty-nine elementary schools in Indianapolis , " he explains ruefully ; " it 'll be a long time before it 's our turn again , " Sprague does n't intend to watt . There arc sixteen state parks in Indiana , he points out . Six have group camping facilities , one camp is winterized . The state has eleven private camps , fifty-five church camps , ninety youth-organization camps . " We 'll get in somewhere . " Such reactions arc common among school principals who have tried camping , and this goes a long way toward explaining the spread of the idea . Besides Indianapolis , Indiana now has school camping in Ashley , Bloomington , Boone County , Columbia City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terre Haute and West Lafayette  --  to give you an idea of the trend of things in just one state . Reading a selection of the reports which educators have rendered over the past twenty years , one does not receive the impression that they regard camping as the solution for all educational problems . There 's evidence , however , that they consider it a better way to teach certain important lessons than any other in widespread use . My own " evaluation " ? I agree with the young lady who wrote , " The most wonderful thing of all is the campfire . " Bob Tully has a way of conducting a first campfire session that one does not soon forget . When everybody is settled and the fire is high and the first songs are out of the way , he begins to tell about the Indians . He tells about their custom of silence around the campfire . This was one of the times , and one of the places  --  so the Indians believed  --  when , if you were very still , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Great Spirit . So they never talked around the campfire . We were still for a time , a long time , perfectly still , all of us . Sitting around the fire with the kids that night , feeling the bigness and mystery of things , was one of the times in my life when I thought I was close to understanding what the prophet meant when he wrote , " Be still and know .... " It was , as the school people had assured me at the outset it would be , an experience . THE END
