THE WHITEOAK BROTHERS ( 307 pp. ) - Mozo de la Roche - Atlantic-Little , Brown ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> The year 1927 is recorded in literary history as the year of Sinclair Lewis ' Elmer Gantry . Thomas Mann 's Magic Mountain and Willa Gather 's Death Comes for the Archbishop , among other notable books , but for fans of Mazo de la Roche , the real importance of 1927 is that it saw the first of her Jalna novels . Now , 15 Jalna novels later , Author de la Roche has produced another volume in her indefatigable chronicle of the Whiteoak family of Ontario . <P> The latest installment of the Jalna story has special appeal , because when Author de la Roche first began slicing the Whiteoak loaf it never occurred to her that it was going to have to last for a quarter of a century . Now she is obliged to do some fine cutting off the butt end . The Whiteoak Brothers is about Jalna in 1923 , but as there have already been eight books about Jalna since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time chuckling over the brothers ' efforts to evade destinies that have long since been translated into 14 languages . <P> Charmer from Yorkshire . Brothers starts with Renny Whiteoak , master of Jalna , firmly in his seat , or rather his saddle , because Renny is the type of man who only gets off his horse when he is watching a horse show . Uncles Ernest and Nicholas are still getting aged and shaky ; Grandma Adeline ( who died some books ago ) is lively as a cricket at the age of 98 . Brothers Eden ( 22 ) , Piers ( 19 ) , Finch ( 15 ) , Wakefield ( 8 ) are still in the process of growing into the well-known adults they have long since become : their habits of twisting each other 's arms , catcalling and frolicking make grandma trumpet , " Ha ! I like to see the whelps rioting ! " New to Jalna is Dilly Warkworth , a charmer from Yorkshire who has come over to snare Renny . New , too , is sinister Mr. Kronk , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet of earlier Jalna books ) the very sucker he wants . <P> Readers who are interested in money will enjoy reading of how innocent Eden persuades almost all the Whiteoaks to invest in Mr. Kronk 's phony mine . But those who think love is more important will follow with bated breath the duel between steady Renny and giddy Dilly : <P> " ' We are made for each other , ' she said breathlessly . ' . . . We ca n't help coming together , can we ? ' <P> " He stroked his left eyebrow with his forefinger . ' I do n't see why , ' he said . " <P> Dispassionate Wonder . Renny 's Whiteoaky common sense drives Dilly crazy . " Patronizing brute ! " she screams , waving a poker at him . But the master is so unmoved that when Dilly bends over " to sweep the hearth , " he , " dispassionately observing her figure from the rear , wondered how he ever could have expected her to have a good seat on a horse . " " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la Roche , " makes me think of Trollope and Galsworthy . " In fact , Author de la Roche 's achievement seems to be that she knows that Jalna 's changeless orchards , spaniels , horses and horseplay are just what a lot of city-pent readers are grateful for . She is to her worldwide audience what bedroom slippers are to tired feet-cozy , roomy , unashamedly woolly and beyond artistic criticism .
