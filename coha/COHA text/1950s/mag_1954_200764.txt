As oppressive summer weather dawdled into autumn , the polite plunk of tennis balls could still be heard on the grass courts of eastern country clubs , where tennis came of age . But the tall , tanned young men who had spent the summer putting the touch on tournament committees with their " amateur " expense accounts had almost all gone west and south for a season in the sun . <P> As usual , the travelers had taken their worst habits with them ; they were playing unreliable , unpredictable tennis . Far off form last week , Vic Seixas , the new U.S. champion , was knocked out in the quarter finals of Mexico City 's Pan-American tournament . ( The week before , Seixas had been beaten by Mexico 's Gustavo Palafox in Davis Cup competition . ) Temperamental Art Larsen let Mexican officiating get under his skin , lost out in the semifinals . Only Tony Trabert held his own against the mediocre competition , and at week 's end he won the title . <P> Home in Manhattan , the Davis Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a thin-skinned performer . ( Only last month at Forest Hills , a loud American crowd bothered him so much that he blew right out of the national championships . ) Solemnly , the committee announced that , for all their faults , Tony and Vic are the best around . With Inter collegiate Champion Ham Richardson and Captain Billy Talbert , they will be sent on one more trip to Australia in one more effort to bring home the Davis Cup . <P> All but convinced that this year 's best is not good enough , the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association is trying to build for the future . A couple of promising teenagers will travel with the Davis Cup team just for experience ; a group of other youngsters , coached by crafty old-Pro Jack Kramer , has been learning the pitfalls of the summer-tournament circuit at home . <P> Those pitfalls are likely to turn America 's new crop of amateurs into the same sort of semipros who have been disappointing tennis fans for years . Writes one-time Davis Cup Player Sidney Wood Jr. : " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . . . travel the tournament trail in relative luxury throughout South America , Europe , Egypt , India and most of the U.S. ... He is often able to set aside some rainy-day savings gleaned from an expense account well in excess of the legally prescribed $15 daily . " <P> Never properly promoted , never popular enough to be a national sport , U.S. amateur tennis remains a subsidized pastime , the responsibility of the nation 's country and tennis clubs . A tournament traveler needs more than a smooth supply of shots ; he must also get along with the station-wagon set . " You do n't have to worry about my boys , " Coach Kramer told the U.S.L.T.A. " They dress right , act right and talk right . " Tennis fans were happy to hear that the boys play well , too .
