I started to work at 7:30 a. m. , stopping first at the farmhouse of Mr. and Mrs. William Mihelich for a pair of clippers and a stack of red cards with No. 4 on them . I Was to stick a card into each lug of grapes I picked . Skilled Average $10 to $15 While the woman at the next vine picked nine lugs , I managed , between those I dropped , ate , or could n't budge without a crowbar , to fill three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages . This makes a real difference to the skilled workers who average $10 to $15 a day in the grape vineyards and up to $25 a day in the cotton fields where they 'll go from here  --  if the notion suits them . There was an elderly woman picking grapes a few vines down from me . " Where do you live ? " I asked , scanning the vineyard for a tent . " 0 , I live on the farm here , " she said . " We own it , my son and I. " She was Mrs. Margaret Mihelich , 65 , who has picked grapes for 30 years because she likes it . There were Mrs. Rose Suchma and Mts . Thelma Blust , commuters from Bloomingdale , 15 miles away . I had hitched a ride with them to the vineyard .

Her mother and a 19 year old brother were clipping in a vineyard over yonder , she said . Lives in a Tent " Where do you live ? " I aski .. d . " In a tent , ma'am , " she said .

She explained that her family owns a house and 15 acres in Tampa . They like to travel and , Aork in the crops . " There 's good money in it , ma'am , " she added . Failing to find any migrants in a sad plight in the Mihelich vineyard , I shamefully left my lugs and took off by foot down the road . Takes Baby into Fields I turned in at the next vineyard , following a baby 's cries to a little red shack where a pretty , 19 year old brunette girl in blue jeans was busily emptying a banana crate . " This is the baby 's crib , " she explained . " We always take her out in the fields with us . " She was Thelma Baxley .

They do n't have to spend money on rent , furniture , clothes , or transportation they hitchhike , so they have plenty for entertainment , she said . No , they do n't save any .

Inside , a woman was cooking bacon and hominy , amid a shambles of incredible filth . I was starting to count the numerous ragged and barefoot children when the man of the house spat tobacco ! juice over the head of one of them and said beaming , " These ai n't half of them .

" and my wife can make $25 a day in the cotton patch , besides what ! the kids bring in . " His 5 year old ' boy and a 7 year old girl were experts in a cotton patch , he added .
