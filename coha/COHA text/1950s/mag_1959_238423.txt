THE SATYRICON OF PETRONIUS ( 218 pp. ) - Translafed by William Arrowsmith-University of Michigan ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> The study of Latin offers two great rewards among others : in the first year the student learns to decipher dates on cornerstones , and in the seventh or eighth , if he is clever , he is able to read the Satyricon . The randy classic , which deals with a kind of conjugation untouched by grammars , has been nibbled at on the sly by headmasters and bishops ; one old Etonian boasted that he had four editions and thought it " rather a gesture ' ' to keep his best one , bound in clerical black , on his pew at chapel . <P> Classicists have violated the customary translators ' code of leaving juicy passages corseted in the original Latin . This version , by a translator who understands the high art of low humor , is conspicuously uncorseted and , what is more unusual , funny . <P> Refined Voluptuary . The Satyricon-whose title may refer both to satire and to the customary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nero 's " arbiter of elegance . " of whom Tacitus wrote : " He spent his days in sleeping , his nights in the enjoyment of life . That success which most men achieve by dint of hard work , he won by laziness . Yet unlike those prodigals who waste themselves and their substance alike , he was not regarded as either a spendthrift or a debauchee , but rather as a refined voluptuary . ' ' <P> Petronius ' story follows the happenstance progress of three impure pilgrims : the freeloader Encolpius ( whose name means , roughly , " the crotch ' ' ) ; the effeminate boy Giton. who is Encolpius ' " brother " ( " frater " to Romans had a double meaning of homosexuality ) ; and Ascyltus. who lusts after Giton . With a straight face . Petronius defended the propriety of his romance : <P> <P> Then why in heaven 's name must every nagging prude of Cato 's ilk cry shame , denounce my work as lewd , damning with a look my guileless , simple art , this simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English is typical of Latinist Arrowsmith 's translation-is. of course , sheer nonsense . The Satyricon is as impure and guileful as anything in literature , and Petronius was mocking Roman bluenoses when he pretended to deny it . But the great gaiety of the work , and the sharpness with which Petronius satirizes esthetes , pedants , bad poets , the nouveau riche and the rapacious poor , lift this gutter odyssey well above the merely pornographic . The fragment that remains of the original huge manuscript is a mixture of prose , poetry and puns , fustian rhetoric and sweaty argot .
