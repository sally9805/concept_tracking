Wyzanski Jr . heard the latest installment in two years of testimony that gives clues as to how Sherman Adams ' friend Bernard Goldfine managed to live , despite income tax laws , as high as his current listing in Boston 's telephone directory suggests . The suit was brought by George B. Heddendorf , 55 , economist for the Babson Institute , who in 1949 invested about $5,000 savings in the stocks of the Goldfine-controlled East Boston Co. and its subsidiary , Boston Port Development Corp . <P> Heddendorf knew that the net value of the company 's real estate was far more than the market value of the outstanding stock , but he was surprised to get neither dividends nor the legally required financial reports . Meanwhile , the Boston Stock Exchange needled the Securities and Exchange Commission into getting a 1954 court injunction forcing a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heddendorf straight to court with the charge that Boston Port 's majority ( 80% ) stockholder , one Bernard Goldfine , had teamed up with friends to milk the company and other shareholders . Last week Goldfine agreed to put back into the company some $400,000 , about $130,000 more than he personally owed . <P> Items from the Goldfine school of management , as revealed in the court record : <P> Between 1945 and 1948 , Goldfine arranged to borrow $79,750 from the company in 21 unsecured loans , never repaid a cent of principal or interest . <P> He knew and approved of matching loans , usually made the same day , to Company President William J. McDonald , whose death in 1948 left Goldfine in sole control of the company , also left all of McDonald 's company borrowings forever uncollectable because of a statute of limitations . <P> Though most of the loans were interest-free , Goldfine agreed in some cases to pay interest ; in 1949 company records officially excused him from every cent of $67,833 unpaid interest . <P> Even while he built up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibilities of a company officer ; he simply operated through his private secretary , Miss Mildred Paperman , who held key posts as treasurer and director of Boston Port . <P> No man to keep more records than he had to , he ordered faithful Miss Paperman to run the company for a couple of years on a cash basis ; as soon as each month 's rental checks came in she cashed them at Boston 's Pilgrim Trust Co. , paid bills in folding money rather than checks . After selling a piece of Boston Port land to the state of Massachusetts for $700,000 , instead of the $400,000 that the state originally offered , Goldfine pocketed $20,000 in commission for himself-in the form of a loan from Boston Port .
