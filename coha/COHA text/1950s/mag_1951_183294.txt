Appleby , 32 , a veteran of eleven years with the company , was the second man off eastbound , roared up into the night headed for Denver and Chicago . On board the huge DC-6 , his 45 passengers , among them a mother &; father with their three children , settled back with pillows and magazines for the ten-hour flight . <P> At 1:56 a.m. , the radio at the Denver tower crackled into life . Captain Appleby was south of Cheyenne , Wyo. at 8,500 feet and letting down to land at Denver . That was all anyone ever heard from him . Twelve hours later , search planes spotted the still-smoldering wreckage splattered along the slopes of 10,500-foot Crystal Mountain near Fort Collins , Colo . The DC-6 , some 40 miles off its course , had glided into the mountain side at the 8,600-foot level , furrowed a 50-foot-wide path through the pines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a mile beyond . A rescue party labored up the mountain to the scene of the crash , radioed back a too-familiar message : " No sign of life . "
