Windfall for Whitford A Story by Lowry Charles Wimberly Drawings by Anthony Saris D 44 EAR , you think too much , " Marcella was always saying . " Drink your tea . Do n't stop and think with the cup halfway to your mouth . " And sometimes she would reach over and give the cup a little push toward his lips . Well , doubtless the cup did need a little pushing , as did Whitford himself . He turned the corner at Wood and Sumner and headed north into the wind . Marcella was right . He must quit thinking so much . At the moment he was thinking of how , three days ago , he had rescued the Chancellor 's hat from the March wind . Poor Piddlington , too , had sprinted for the hat , but had stumbled and fallen . Had Whitford tripped Piddlington up  --  unwittingly , that is ? One did so many things unwittingly . But he must put that question out of his head and concentrate on the committee report he was to pick up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this as in all things . Doctor Flembody 's too , for that matter . Not that Marcella knew as yet anything about the hat . He was on his way , only now , to break the good news . It was simply that he should be mindful of her gentle , oft-repeated warning to quit vexing that poor head of his . But before seeing her he must be sure to stop at Yardley 's . " Yardley 's first , " he said , " then Marcella 's . " He must keep that straight . He fumbled in his coat pocket for an address book Marcella had helped him fill out . But he could n't find it . He tried another pocket , then still another . Well , no great matter ; he knew just about where Yardley lived . A streetcar clanged at him crossing an intersection . And as he drew near an alley a newspaper sheet blew against his legs , and stayed plastered there despite his efforts to kick it off . " Here now , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And he had finally to stoop , tear the sheet in two and let each half blow on down the street . He looked back , noting that one half was whisked around the corner , the other driven along Sumner toward the college campus . " Now just what , " he asked himself , " does that signify , those halves parting company in that way ? And will they ever ' , by some odd chance , come together again ? " Whitford was given to fanciful queries like that , queries Marcella and the doctor were forever scolding him about . The doctor had a technical word for it , a word Whitford could never recall . Still , the questions about the wind-blown paper were not wholly without relevance . For did n't he owe his present good spirits to the wind and the Chancellor 's wind-blown hat ? What if the wind had n't been up three days ago ? And what if the Chancellor had n't been standing , tall and columnar , in front of the Commerce Building with the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Whitford , had n't been led , as if by Fate , to take his afternoon walk earlier than usual ? One might see a divine ordering in it all , a providential conspiracy of the elements in one 's favor . Marcella , at any rate , would so read the incident . She had a way , too , of viewing events , however long delayed , as being appropriately timed in the celestial calendar . Whitford quickened . his pace , scarcely noticing the newsboy walking beside him , begging him to buy a paper . He should have proposed to Marcella years ago , just as , years ago , he should have done many things . He might have laid something away , for instance , instead of buying so many books . But Marcella loved books too . She knew Shakespeare and was always telling Whitford he was like Hamlet . It had come to be one of their little jokes . Whenever she brought it up lie would say , " Here , now , you do n't think I 'm mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , " she would say , somewhat wistfully , " that you think too much before acting . And sometimes , you know , you do n't act at all . " Well , no doubt one should act , get things done . Like the Chancellor . He got things done . Or Yardley . " We must gear ourselves to the off-campus world , to the machinery of actual life , " the Chancellor had said in a speech , not thinking , perhaps , that the world might better gear itself to the college . But as for Whitford he felt himself not geared to anything in particular . And even when he had acted , nothing much had come of it . During his long years of teaching he had begun six books  --  or was it five ? ? and had almost completed one of them . He had gone toscholarly meetings too , some of them in distant places . Those were the ones he liked , those faraway , and but for thoughts of Marcella he might never have taken the train for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he returned her greeting . without , however , recognizing who she was . She was dressed in white , though . and he thought of the nurses in Flembody 's clinic . Then someone else spoke to him or . rather , roared at him through the wind . It was Heinke , carrying a briefcase and headed for the campus . Whitford would have ducked into a doorway had he seen him coming . " How goes the battle ? " Heinke roared , or had roared , for he was on past , before Whitford fully caught his words . Heinke was in biology and viewed life as a battle . " You have to fight for what you get in this world . It 's a battle for survival , " he was forever bellowing , with a look that more than intimated Whitford would n't survive . Well , if Heinke was right , Whitford did n't care to survive . But who , after all , was Heinke ? Evidence that he was wrong would shortly be found in the book Whitford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write books to refute Heinke . The evidence was everywhere ; in Marcella , for instance . Or in the Chancellor 's hat . The hat 's blowing off the Chancellor 's head just as ' Whitford had come along , was proof , as Marcella would put it , of a beneficent order  --  an order that used mere physical things , such as hats , March winds , and sidewalks , for its own kindly ends . But what of Piddlington ? How had he fared ? Still , one better not dwell on Piddlington . There was Yardley to think of , and the report . Whitford fumbled again in his pockets for the address book , and again could n't find it . People like Heinke , though , could have found it . Rather , they would n't have lost it . The Heinkes had gummed-label minds  --  kept indexes , card catalogues , filing cases . They catalogued everything , even the beneficent order itself , indexing it as a myth . And the Chancellor 's hat . They must by now have tabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as further evidence , in a small way , of the struggle for existence . They might even think Whitford had deliberately tripped Piddlington up . For it was true enough that Piddlington had also made a dash for the hat as it went skittering along the walk . He had popped up from nowhere and had run neck and neck with Whitford for a full half block . What 's more  --  for this , too , had to be admitted  --  he had kept elbowing Whitford , had , indeed , crowded him to the edge of the walk ; and then , for no apparent reason , Piddlington had stumbled . But of course Whitford had n't tripped him , and he wished the campus wag who was circulating that little story had kept it to himself . Anyhow , if there had been a battle that was the extent of it  --  the race of Whitford against Piddlington , the prize being the Chancellor 's hat . Or was it such a prize , everything considered ? The word had ugly implications . It meant dashing someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had meant , in this case , that Whitford , not Piddlington , had been called into the Chancellor 's office for a friendly chat . In this case  --  Whitford brought himself up sharply as he recalled Marcella 's admonition , many times delivered : " You think too much , clear . Come inside . Do n't keep standing there . " Well , he would n't stand there this afternoon . He would go inside at once , would at once tell her what had happened , and if she tried bringing up their joke about Hamlet he would say , " No , you do n't . This time there was no thinking at all . It was done quite without thinking . " And so it had been . He had simply obeyed an impulse and sprinted after the hat . And yet as he had raced along the sidewalk , with Piddlington beside him , a fleeting thought had entered his head , or rather a second impulse  --  an urge to keep on running , to pass the hat up , to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get faraway from it all and never return . But he would n't tell Marcella about that second impulse . It would n't have done to leave Marcella . And as Whitford pushed on against the wind he tried again to picture her ? her dress , her eyes and hair , particularly her mouth . But now , as always , no clear image came to mind . It was like trying to recall a loved one long since dead . Marcella , to be sure , was not dead , and it was strange that once he was away from her she became so imperceptible , so like an illusion . The impression he had now was that of a somehow gossamer , grayish little figure , ashape nearly impalpable and that seemed always to be blending with the old-fashioned furniture of the living room , indistinguishable from the chairs with their gray upholstery or the walls with their dim paper . It was as though Marcella would be invisible were she to stand against the wall , as though , were she to stand there very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , might vanish from his sight forever . And he wondered if she would n't , some day , do just that , if some clay when he called to her in the living room she would n't fail to appear and he be left there alone , peering through his glasses , trying vainly to evoke her presence . " Ah , Marcella , " he said , " Marcella ! " He felt a great need of her now , but felt somehow that she was faraway and that he might not reach her , as if all the thoughts of all the years had become a labyrinth in which he found himself wandering , calling to her , trying to find her . H E LOOKED along the street , hoping she might be coming to meet him as she had on other days . But he knew she would n't be . He had n't phoned her . Or had lie ? A car , its radio blaring , honked at him , and he caught the sharp whistle of a traffic policeman . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . " But he did n't see who it was . Anyhow , he 'd better be careful , better watch the red light . Marcella was always holding him back from such things  --  traffic lights , raised places in the sidewalk , the precipices of his thoughts . He should be with her now , telling her about everything , especially his visit with the Chancellor . The Chancellor had called him in yesterday . Or was it the day before ? No , that would be two days ago , and that was the day the Chancellor was out of town . Whitford began going over the whole thing again , trying to get it straight ; then he went back to the beginning and came forward once more , but both times , at a certain point , he had the queer feeling that he had already told Marcella all about it . Surely , though , he had n't . It was just a way he had of fancying a thing done before it really was  --  an illusion for which Marcella was always chiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ago when he entered the hospital . Absurdly enough . he had told Mar-celia he had been in and out of the hospital even before he had entered it . " It 's because , dear , " she had said more than once , " you keep going over a thing again and again in your head . " Other people , too , had of late been telling him this or that . The doctor , for instance . He had hinted , or rather had said outright  --  but what , precisely , had the doctor said or hinted ? Someone was suddenly walking beside him , plucking at his sleeve . It was a man , thin-faced , white-haired , asking for the price of something or other . Whitford gave him some change , more than the price , and as the man drifted on down the street Whitford saw him as a derelict in the wind , the archetype of those who 've lost out in the battle . Had he seen the man before ? He had a notion he had , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Marcella about his chat with the Chancellor . But he could n't have seen the old fellow on this street , for this was Sumner , a street Whitford seldom took . For one thing , Heinke always took it . Yardley , too . What , then , was Whitford doing on Sumner ? He ran his hand along the buttons of his coat , counting them . It was a trick suggested by one of the nurses for straightening out his thoughts . It did n't always work , but it worked now ; he remembered the report he was to pick up at Yardley 's . Obviously , then , Whitford was on Sumner because that was Yardley 's street . T HE Chancellor himself had asked Whit- ford to stop for the report . The Chan- cellor was strong for reports , for com-mittees and subcommittees . He enjoyed the hum of the academic mill , and seemed to believe that where three or four are gathered together in committee , there God is also . As to that , Whitford had his doubts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that event he and not Whitford might be on his way to Yardley 's . Piddlington needed to win races ; he had a family . Still , he had n't won . But Whitford would n't stay long at Yardley 's ; he 'd hurry on to Marcella 's . How many times , though , had he set out to do this or that and failed to do it ! Only last week when he was supposed to show up at Smithson 's dinner , lie had found himself rummaging through old books in a second-hand store . He liked old books . In MAGAZINE them one found sanctuary from bustling streets , brief-case Heinkes , committee-mad Yardleys . And yet it was too bad , his missing Smithson 's dinner . It would be even worse had he already told Marcella about the hat . Still , Marcella would n't mind . She would want him to go over the whole thing again , especially that part where the Chancellor had come out from behind his desk , drawn up a chair close to Whitford , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a laugh  --  the laugh seeming to come , though , at the wrong place in the talk . And yet Whitford was n't sure just where the laughs had come . His mind had got to wandering , and it was only because the Chancellor had a way of stressing things by slapping a person on the knee that Whitford had heard mention of the Governor , the Mayor , the hat , the Governor again , and then mention , finally , of printer 's ink and promotions in rank . " Take it easy , but get that book of yours into shape , " the Chancellor had said , though Whitford could n't recall having told him anything about the book . ' Everything , you know , hinges on printer 's ink . " The Chancellor was right . One thing does hinge on another . Whitford 's being in the Chancellor 's office hinged on the hat . But what a trifling service to render anyone . And how incredible that the Chancellor had taken such note of it . Then the Chancellor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a moment Whitford must have got up too , for the Chancellor was seeing him to the door , asking him to pick up the committee report at Yardley 's , laughing again about the hat , and telling him again not to overdo but to get that book ready . " I will , I will , " Whitford had said , and then he was in the hallway and on through it and down the steps to the walk . He had struck off across the campus in some direction or other and had kept saying , as if muttering an incantation , " I will , I will " ; and before long the words for the final chapter of the book had begun racing through his head . T HOSE same words , though , had raced through his head many a time  --  in his room , on his walks , on the train . The trouble was that despite Marcella 's urging he had never set them down . " But I will now , " he said , " I will . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , at any rate , to blast the Heinkes . And yet could he ever finish the book , really ? Was anything ever finished in this world ? The universe itself  --  but he must get on toward Yardley 's , Marcella 's . All his misgivings would vanish over a cup of tea with Marcella . Or would they vanish ? A traffic jam held him up at Sumner and Clark , and then as the crowds thinned out and the stores gave way to houses he saw up ahead a man stuffing letters into a mailbox . It looked like Yardley . It was Yardley , in front of his house . " High Pockets , " the students called him , because of his stilt legs . He was forever mailing letters , Yardley was  --  eternally pestering publishers about new books he was planning , or flooding the mails with questionnaires to get more data for scholarly articles . He was always dinging at other people to write books , too  --  Whitford , for instance . " You ought to get into the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the episode of the hat , he would be telling Whitford that at last he was in the game , that he had the inside track with the Chief . Yardley called the Chancellor the Chief , and aspired , doubtless , to be chief himself some day . There was nothing of the old school about Yardley . Like Heinke , he was a man of action . He belonged to luncheon clubs , gave radio talks , trotted here and there over the state , lecturing . He believed in taking advantage of the breaks , believed , too , no doubt , in crowding other men out of the way if necessary or tripping them up . The Chancellor and he were buddies , or so the talk went . They played golf together , and Yardley always let the Chancellor win two games out of three . " Everything hinges on printer 's ink , " the Chancellor said . And Yardley would tune up too the moment he saw Whitford . There he was now about to turn from the mailbox. just before he turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIKED alleys , but he hurried along this one , past tin cans , ash heaps , weeds . For what if Yardley had been at the mailbox , not so much to mail letters as to watch for Whitford 's coming ? And what if he had spotted Whitford , was even now running after him , on those long legs of his , to remind him of that report ? Whitford glanced back ; the alley was empty . In a kind of panic he looked ahead to the other end , fearing that Yardley might somehow stop him there or the Chancellor be waiting-to collar him . But he encountered neither Yardley nor the Chancellor , and once he was upon the street , lost in another crowd , he felt that elation that comes to all who find an asylum , however momentary , from the Heinkes and the Yardleys , from the stir , the busywork , the puttering . A block or so away newsboys were yelling afternoon editions , and before long another beggar plucked at Whitford 's sleeve , but he took no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee report and of how , after all , he had failed to pick it up . Marcella would scold him for that . What did the report amount to , though , in the vast scale of things ? Nothing ; less than nothing . And life itself . What of it ? " A little gleam of time , " Carlyle had called it ? " a little gleam of time between two eternities . " That would please Marcella . But what of Rabelais , the ex-monk , and his giant laughter ? " Let down the curtain , " Rabelais said , as he lay dying ; " the farce is over . " That was it . Life is a farce ; therein lies the tragedy of it . How farcical , for example , had been the race of Piddlington and Whitford for the Chancellor 's hat ! No wonder the campus wag was having his little joke . But was it a joke ? How would Piddlington regard it , he who had stumbled and fallen ? " Why , of course , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke , that talk of your tripping him up . Do n't think about it . Do n't vex yourself . " But what if Piddlington himself believed Whitford had actually tripped him ? And what if Whitford , without meaning to , had done just that ? He thought of Heinke again , his view that life is a battle , a fight for survival , man against man , brute against brute , a play of elemental , sinister powers that lurk , it may be , in the subconscious , ready to spring . Heinke might , after all , have the truth of it . Whitford looked down at his left foot , remembering that Piddlington had run on the inside ; so it must have been that foot which did the trick  --  sent Piddlington sprawling . And now that same foot , with the help of the right , was carrying him to Marcella , the quietness of her voice , her admonishing little smile , the cup of tea she would hand him . But would his feet ever bring him to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they had n't . Strange how things come about . The March wind and the hat . The wind had blown him , so to speak , into the Chancellor 's office , favoring him over Piddlington . But might there not be a duplicity in the wind , as in people , as in the universe itself ? Keats had a teeming brain . Why had hispen not been permitted to glean it ? And Shelley and Poe . Why had they been cut off so young ? Perhaps , though , the duplicity of life lay only on the surface . Maybe there was an underlying wisdom in things , a wisdom greater even than Marcella 's . " And now , dear , " she would say , " you must really finish the book . Things are looking up for you . " So he must finish the book , must he  --  pen the last chapter , the final word ? But in this life no word . no chapter , can be final . roeLE with packages brushed past Whitford , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , who either swore at him or begged his pardon , he was n't sure which . He was n't sure of anything somehow . He stopped and looked at the buildings , trying to recognize them . He glanced down at his feet again , then began once more lifting them along the walk . Were they the same feet that had run after the Chancellor 's hat , the same feet that had carried him , on other days , to Marcella ? No , they were n't , actually . For nothing remained the same , from day to day , moment to moment . Who had said that a man can not enter twice the same river ? Was it Democritus. the philosopher who laughed ? No , not Democritus . It was Heraclitus , the weeping philosopher . And someone else had said that he who is invited to come next week to a feast will go uninvited , for when the feast day arrives the inviter and the invited will not be the same men they were . No , these were not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago had started a book which yesterday he had promised the Chancellor to finish . The Chancellor , too , was by now another man . In his character of yesterday he had ceased to exist , as it were . And Marcella . Would Whitford ever see her again ? Had she , too , vanished as he had feared someday she would ? He must , by now , have turned another corner , for the wind was at his back . But it should n't be . That meant he was going away from Marcella . He slowed down , then half turned , walking sidewise , as if to face into the wind again , as if again to face the report , the unfinished book , the Chancellor , Yardley , Marcella  --  all those who would smile at him and Heraclitus , who ' Would maintain that he who begins a book can be the same man who finishes it . But they would be wrong . Heraclitus knew that such a book , if it could be completed , would have been authored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than which nothing in the shape of a book is more abominable . T . HE wind felt good at Whitford 's back . With its help he quickened his steps , hurried indifferently through green lights and red , until he was half running , glad to be free , glad to have come full circle as though there had been no Chancellor 's hat , no book to finish , no report to pick up . It was as if he had thought his way out of a dilemma , avoided a snare , a trap cunningly devised by Yardley , the Chancellor , Flembody , those engaged in a conspiracy to bring him into line , gear him to some machine or other . True , he had missed seeing Marcella , but he would see her another day . Or would he ? " Dear , " she had said , more than once , " even Hamlet brought things to a conclusion. - Was Marcella , too , in league against him ? No , that could n't be . But he must decide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched the buttons of his coat . He thought hard . He recalled his running after the hat , his impulse to pass the hat up and keep running , leaving everything behind . He recalled , too , the scholarly meetings , thosein far places , remembered the times he had taken train or bus for home , remembered that but for Marcella he might not have returned . " Exert Hamlet , dear , brought things to an end . " Marcella had always smiled over those words . But had she spoken them wholly , if at all , in jest ? And had n't her smile been only a way of sparing him ? Things should be brought to an end . That was true enough , and those words of Marcella 's , so many times repeated , made everything clear at last to Whitford ; gave him his bearings . He recognized the buildings now ; knew the street he was on ; was aware of traffic lights . Two streets over and a block south was a depot , the main bus station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liked especially to stand near the lines at the ticket windows and overhear people buying tickets for places faraway . He would stop at the bus depot , look up the schedules . He turned west at the next corner , walked two blocks , then turned south , but he did n't stop at the bus depot after all . He kept going until lie came to the railway station . And as he was buying a ticket , he wondered if ever again he would see Marcella . " I 'd take a train , dear , not a bus , " she had always said , when he was about to set out on a journey . Well , lie preferred trains himself .
