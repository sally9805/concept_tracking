there was the quick , sharp rip of khaki drill tearing , and the shirt fell apart , revealing the entire chest . The right side had hardly been touched but the left , until now concealed by the shirt , was a mass of twisted flesh . I looked away . The lieutenant had taken a couple of steps forward , was standing a few feet from the Zulu . He had a set look on his face , holding the weapon stiffly in front of him , pointing it at the dying man . The Zulu 's hand was buried deep in the sand , gripping the earth , supporting his body . To me , at that moment , it seemed that in a last superhuman effort he wanted to lift himself , rise , and so , with both feet planted firmly on the ground , meet his death face to face . He had squared his shoulders , throwing them back and was straining his chest out and up , as if to present a better target to the enemy or to shove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his eyes , now , were ablaze as if all the fierce passionate life that remained to him were concentrated in their jet-black depths . " Ngidubule ! Ngidubule ! " It broke from his dry , cracked lips in a crescendo , like a shout of joy , a triumphant roar ; and I was suddenly reminded of the Zulu battle cry I had so often heard , sonorous and barbaric , bursting from a thousand throats when the war dance reaches its frenzied , crashing climax . " Ngidubule ! Ngidubule ! " Yes , he was roaring at his body , roaring at his pain , roaring at death . I stood looking down at him , rooted to the spot . I wanted to tear myself away , butcould n't . Carefully , methodically , the lieutenant took aim along the pistol barrel . I felt a hand touch my shoulder . For a second it lay there , immobile . Then it tightened over my collarbone . I half turned . It was the captain . Slowly he turned me completely around . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I kept pace with him . I was waiting , it seemed , for yet another " Ngidubule ! " rather than for the pistol 's report . When a snail-shell ( one of those countless bone-white shells scattered like so many little skulls about the desert ) popped under my feet , I shuddered . We were about fifteen yards away when the pistol cracked . It did not go off again . I HAVE a very hazy recollection of what happened after that . I remember the German captain saying , " Auf Wiedersehen " ; the two officers driving off in a small car ; and that for a long time I sat on a fiat stone beside the road . Legs , many legs , milled past , kept slipping in and out of my vision . But they made no impression on me ; in a dull , disconnected way I was more interested in the little wisps of sand that kept spiraling , circling round my boots , and then settling in a thin , filmy , pale-yellow dust on the broad , square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boots , I do not know . Someone shouted in Afrikaans : " Come along , Du Toitl Come along ! " and when I found myself again , I was once more among that crowd of prisoners tramping slowly , wearily , toward Tobruk . Rebop , Bebop , and Bop Marshall W. Stearns W HEN an eager undergraduate once demanded , " What is jazz , Mr. Waller ? " the great pianist is said to have growled : " Man , if you do n't know what it is , do n't mess with id " And the land that gave birth to jazz has followed Fats Waller 's advice . During the twenties , when famous European musicians were writing enthusiastically about this new American music , the hostile attitude of our own composers and critics was typified by Gilbert Seldes ' comment : " I am on the side of civilization . " It is a matter of record that the first reasonably competent book on jazz was published in Belgium in 1932 ; the first good book by an American did not appear until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moralists of the lunatic fringe who periodically announce that jazz is the cause of juvenile delinquency and the common cold were not having the same success in hitting the headlines . Somewhere along the line a battle had been won and jazz had become an accepted sound , if not yet accepted music , in America . There was even scattered talk of jazz as a native art-form , to be classed with chewing gum , Mickey Mouse , and the skyscraper . In fact , even the most confirmed critics of jazz seemed to be adjusting successfully to the new environment , when suddenly jazz itself erupted into a civil war which split its own ranks andgave new hope to those who had said it would never last . The center of attention seemed to be a new kind of jazz , successively known as " Rebop , " " Bebop , " and finally just plain " Bop . " When this volcano eventually subsided , the landscape of jazz had completely changed . What had happened ? F ORTUNATELY , the brief but busy history of jazz music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material comes from an unexpected source : the anthropologists who have investigated the music of the West African coast . It is from this area that a large number of Americans of Negro ancestry trace their descent . Although the anthropologists are waging their own private wars over the question of how much African culture has survived in the United States , it is clear that many of the communal , improvisational , expressive , and rhythmic qualities of African music can be found today in jazz . We can now safely say that as far as rhythm is concerned African music , far from being crude or barbarous , is actually the most sophisticated in the world . There is some harmony and quite a bit of melody in this music , but its use of complex rhythms is outstanding . Indeed , as the German scholar with the improbable name , Erich M. von Hornbostel , has stated : " The syncope , an African commonplace , is a European achieve-Marshall W. Stearns , now on leave from the Cornell English department to direct a course called " Perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student both of modern American jazz and medieval English literature . ment . " ( By the word " syncope , " Hornbostel probably meant what the jazz musician calls " off-beats . " ) Perhaps it should be added that Hornbostel is the grand-daddy of the musicological anthropologists and/or anthropological musicologists  --  the terms seem to be interchangeable  --  who helped make it possible for us to place jazz in its proper context musically . The work is being ably carried on in this country by Professor Melville J. Herskovits and his department at Northwestern University . The " drum choir , " or trio of drums , supplies the rhythmic heart of African music . These drums are of very different sizes ; the biggest drum with the deepest voice is always called the " Mama " drum , while the smaller drums are known as the " Papa " and the " Baby " drums . The most amazing feature of the drum choir , however , is its use of mixed meters , or polyrhythms , in which two or more separate rhythms occur at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds a few rhythms of its own . To the European or American ear , accustomed to two simple rhythms , played one at a time  --  the 4/4 of the march or the 3/4 of the waltz  --  African music sounds like static during a thunderstorm . We have been so completely conditioned by European music that our ears reduce the steady and undifferentiated beat of a clock , for example , to the 2/4 rhythm of " tick-tock , tick-tock , " and we tend to reduce everything we hear in the same way , from the clicking of the wheels of a train to the complicated tempos of modern compositions . Yet the average West Coast African thinks nothing of matching a 5/4 beat with an already established combination of 6/8 , 4/4 , and 3/4 rhythms . There is probably some truth to the story that when a one-cylinder gasoline engine , with its intermittent explosions , was imported into the Belgian Congo , the natives crowded around in pure ecstasy , fascinated by the unending rhythmic complexity . Many top-notch symphony musicians , rehearsing a score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 7/4 , will furrow their brows with concentration and move their lips as they count to themselves . Some of them have told me afterward that they had no idea of how the music sounded as a whole . On the other hand , African drummers havebeen known on occasion to accent every fifteenth beat simply because they felt it that way at the time  --  and they certainly do not count on their fingers . Again , I have seen the facial expression of a modern composer , famous for his scoring of intricate rhythms , change from pleasure to amazement and finally to something like helplessness as he listened to a record of African drumming . Of course , the musics of the world are many , and African music is by no means the only one with rhythmic complexity . Yet it is difficult for us to realize , since we are hardly aware of any other , how highly specialized our Western music really is . Classical music has developed harmony ( among other things ) to the highest degree but it has very rarely made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classical music of the late nineteenth century , for example , has rhythm but comparatively speaking little or no rhythmic variety . My point is simply that , viewed in true perspective , African music not only can stand securely upon its own merits but also , because of its relationship to jazz , can be regarded as an important influence in American music . H J All did not spring full-blown from the head of Jelly-Roll Morton in 1902 , as that masterful pianist loudly proclaimed , but its birth is still something of a puzzle . We do know that wherever the Negro migrated  --  North America , Cuba . Central America , the Caribbean , or South America  --  he influenced the music of the region deeply and more or less uniformly , according to the receptiveness of the culture in which he found himself . The Negro 's celebrated sense of rhythm , it should be remembered , is not instinctive but rather an unconscious pattern handed down from generation to generation by means of examples , attitudes , and points of view . When Baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great-grandfather " talked " on the drums in the African manner and when he actually remembers some of the rhythms his great-grandfather played , we have a significant though rare example of the African heritage being handed down explicitly from person to person . African music adapted itself quite easily to the Latin-American countries and today is found nearly intact in some areas . The special drum rhythms for various gods which existed in Africa were transferred to Catholic saints in Cuba , Haiti , and Brazil . The African snake god , Damballa , was in certain localities identified for better or worse with St. Patrick . And the entire process was aided by the rhythmic flair of Latin Americans and their generally tolerant attitude toward questions of skin color . In the United States , on the other hand , African music hit a series of high hurdles . The Protestant religion had no saints to whom the ritual drums of Africa could be readapted . Again , the Negro was surrounded by music in which polyrhythms were practically unknown , where there was no syncopation to speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same beat , in the trudging manner of the widely-used Moody and Sankey hymnal . And finally , it was forcibly impressed upon the Negro that he was inferior and that all things African were worthless . In part because of these very obstacles , and perhaps because Catholicism was the official religion in New Orleans until the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 , it was in that city , around 1885 , that a new music was forged , far greater than any of its component parts . For New Orleans , with its Latin colonial background , was a musical melting pot par excellence . Combined with the surviving elements of African music were the melodies of French , Italian , Central European , and Spanish music ( both popular and classical ) , the simple rhythms of Scotch-Irish folk music and German brass bands , and the elementary harmony of Protestant hymns . ( To this mixture , some hardy theorists have added the music of the American Indian and the Chinese laborer . ) An echo of almost any European music can be found in jazz  --  yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , how and to what extent did the specifically African heritage survive ? Although New Orleans was notorious for racial intermixture , social distinctions along economic lines ( except for a small group of Creole aristocrats ) tended to be hard and fast . Poor people were virtually thrown together in a ghetto , although a line of musical communication ran to the wealthy Creoles of Color , and an intense feeling for the common interest sprang up . A great number of fraternal and benevolent organizations were founded , similar in many ways to the African secret societies , and the Negro became a lively contributor with an established audience . Social life revolved around these organizations and many of them had their own bands , without which no picnic , river-boat excursion , parade , or funeral was complete . Music offered one of the few paths for the individual to fame and fortune , but it also mirrored the life of the entire group . It is probably no accident that as this music matured it was characterized by an ensemble style of collective improvisation , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an established rhythmic and harmonic pattern  --  the musical equivalent of a fact in the life of its creators , as well as a definite part of its African heritage . T HERE were other , more specific influences at work . Although holiday cele- brations by the slaves were frowned upon and the manufacture and sale of drums discouraged , the slave-owners sometimes permitted dancing  --  after work . We now know that the slave-owners had reason to fear revolt , and they sometimes considered dancing an effective safety-valve . In time , dancing became a pathway to white approval , though it never abandoned the complex rhythms of the African dance . Certain historical accidents helped too . After the Civil War , the pawnshops were flooded with brass instruments discarded by returning Confederate bands , and these instruments became readily available to the Negro at low cost . The fact that he could not afford orthodox instruction led him to develop his own vocalized style , with an African quality of expressiveness . And there was Storyville , the world-famous red-light district of New Orleans ( created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferment of the times and which lent a sympathetic car to any man 's musical invention . Instead of dying out , the African musical heritage in New Orleans went underground . European melody , harmony , and even instrumentation prevailed , but the elementary rhythms of Europe slowly suffered a sea change . Although the prevailing tempo was the simple 4/4 of the hymn or march , poly-rhythms kept popping up  --  especially in the improvised melodies . Combined with other less tangible factors , a gradual readjustment took place until today we take the rhythmic suspensions of jazz for granted in our dance music . From the turn of the century to about 1940 , however , jazz assimilated more and more of the European musical tradition . There were temporary exceptions when jazz dipped back into the reservoir of Afro-American vitality for inspiration , but in the main line of development the ensemble style of New Orleans gave way to a succession of solos which , in turn , gave way to written arrangements . During the prosperous twenties , the size of the bands increased and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired an improved technique , the emphasis tended to be put on written composition and not on improvisation . Rhythmically speaking , jazz almost stood still for forty years , though it gradually won wide acceptance and became a part of the giant entertainment industry . A few of the big bands did not abandon the sources of their music , however . Duke Ellington and Count Basic , for example , developed a kind of rhythmic streamlining which managed to make clean and satisfying music out of some of Tin Pan Alley 's worst tunes . Basic 's rhythmic amortization of that miserly piece of pie-in-the-sky , " Pennies from Heaven , " released in 1937 , testifies to the sham-destroying humor and basic healthiness of jazz . His orchestra is the nearest thing we have to a big-band ancestor of Bop . By 1940 , jazz  --  then renamed " swing " ? had achieved a comparative equilibrium and a large public ( peace to the bobby-soxers ) which enjoyed , understood , and supported what it heard . Among the extreme enthusiasts which jazz seems to attract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to go forward . The antiquarians had the advantage , for their objectives had long ago been achieved . Yet the musical sky was clear and serene and gave no indication that storm clouds were gathering  --  or that the greatest musical revolution since the birth of jazz itself was about to take place . III T HE public really heard about Bop too late in the day , when the Bop costume ? heavily-rimmed - glasses , goatee , long cigarette holder , and beret  --  had become over-publicized and treated as a joke . This new form of jazz  --  based on comparatively complex rhythms and dissonant harmonies , and rejecting many of the hallowed customs of jam-session etiquette  --  was nearly buried in bewildered press releases . Even the fad among Negroes for adopting Mohammedan names , which had the practical value of making discrimination more difficult ( and may have begun with the small number of West Africans who had been converted by the Arabs long before they were brought to this country ) , was linked indiscriminately with Bop . These symptoms of revolt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music itself . Although the seeds of Bop had been planted long ago , they blossomed during the second world war . Because of the enormous demand for music , dance bands were able to experiment and make a living at the same time ; because of the scarcity of musicians , boys in their teens landed good jobs with first-rate bands . These youngsters were eager , flexible , and bent upon developing a style of their own . During the same period , in an atmosphere of restless rebellion , a great migration to the North was taking place and time itself seemed to be speeded up . In the jazz jargon , " Things were groovy , man ! " After the war , some of the older idols of jazz , having spent the intervening years in the Army unhappily wedded to military bands ? or sometimes in the guardhouse  --  returned to find a music they never blew . Jazz musicians were already split into warring camps . From the early days in 1940 at Minton 's up in Harlem , when a small group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninitiated musicians off the stand during a jam-session , the breach had widened . Today , the split is almost a matter of age alone : musicians over thirty are inclined to criticize Bop , and musicians under thirty tend to praise it enthusiastically . The current state of affairs is indicated by the harsh comments of Louis Armstrong , the acknowledged king of pre-bop jazz . Louis
