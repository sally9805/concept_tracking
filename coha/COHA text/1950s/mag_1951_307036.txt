ONCE AROUND THE SUN 376 pp. ) - Brooks Atkinson-Harcourt , Brace ( $4 ) . <P> <P> Most New Yorkers do n't know it , but there are chickadees in Manhattan . J. ( for Justin ) Brooks Atkinson , 56 , a transplanted New Englander , can hear one above the roar of the traffic at two blocks , he says , and run it down by ear . <P> Bird-Watcher Atkinson is better known for other distinctions . As the influential theater critic of the New York Times , he has as much to do with a Broadway play 's success or failure as any living man . He has been a foreign correspondent in China , won the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 for his dispatches from Moscow . But like one of his own intellectual heroes , Henry Thoreau , Atkinson is happiest close to nature or working with his hands . Ask his religion and he answers : " Transcendentalist . " <P> Revive the Dead . Once Around the Sun , Critic Atkinson 's new book , deals only infrequently with politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each day of the year , touch on everything from New York 's subways ( " Hogs get better care in transit " ) to tax collectors ( " We have submitted to the despotism of contrivers , bullies , informers and crooks " ) ; from Times Square ( " This slovenly canyon " ) to Russian drama and literature ( " Stalin 's success in destroying them is one of his mightiest achievements . No man of ordinary strength could wreck so much national genius " ) . <P> Author Atkinson has , in fact , readably revived an all but dead literary exercise , the informal essay . Like Thoreau , he can write quietly and with an admirable minimum of whimsy about his dearest enthusiasms . Like the Thoreau who wrote Civil Disobedience , he abhors Government poking-around in his affairs : <P> " I put Congress and the Supreme Court on notice not to inquire into my private opinions , which are dangerous because I believe in America . I also warn them not to send me to jail . I should be more dangerous incommunicado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can speak my mind freely and defiantly and contribute copiously to the normal boredom of society . " <P> His next day 's essay is on the blackpoll warbler . <P> Trust Mark Twain . Atkinson writes about the theater with a level eye and uncommon candor : " Basically , the Broadway theater is not an art , but an unsuccessful form of high-pressure huckstering ... It is not developing playwrights , actors or directors . It is doing the best it can to commit suicide . " And on Broadway first-nighters : " They bring nothing into the theater except shallow , distracted minds and tired emotions . . . they have nothing to give . They are the unburied dead , brushed , combed , richly dressed , and expensively embalmed . " <P> On the positive side , he keeps his credo short and sharp : " Trust only the men who laugh with relish . I trust Shakespeare more than Corneille , Mark Twain more than Henry James , Robert Frost more than T. S. Eliot , Ernest Hemingway more than Thomas Mann . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
