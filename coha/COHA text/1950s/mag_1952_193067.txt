No one has had a more pervasive influence on modern design than Walter Gropius . An architect with surprisingly few buildings to show for his 69 years , Gropius has devoted himself mainly to teaching . He headed Germany 's Bauhaus ( " Building House " ) from 1919 to 1928 , made the school a seedbed of new designs . Since 1938 he has directed Harvard University 's department of architecture , graduated hundreds of dedicated moderns . <P> Last week Boston honored Gropius with a big retrospective show of his architecture . Included were models of his glass-walled Bauhaus ( done in 1926 ) and Harvard 's new graduate center ( designed by Gropius and several collaborators ) . The crisp , cold , unornamental lines of his buildings , their rectilinear counterpointing of wide-eyed windows and bare , blind walls , shocked nobody . Gropius has disseminated his philosophy of design so well that now it is almost taken for granted . <P> A Notion from Nature . The Gropius philosophy embraces pictures as well as walls , furniture as well as floor plans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ideas , one practical and the other esthetic . The practical idea was not at all obvious when Gropius first acted on it . Modern designers , he reasoned , should get workshop training and should be made familiar with the materials and the machines used in mass production , and their designs should be geared to make use of those materials and machines . Gropius ' esthetic notion was deceptively simple . Recognizing that the beauties of nature 's creation are part and parcel of their functions , he argued that man 's creations too should combine usefulness with beauty . <P> At the Bauhaus , Gropius gathered a brilliant group of teachers and students to apply his ideas . Marcel Breuer invented the first tubular steel chair . Bogler and Lindig designed pottery for mass production . Josef Albers turned broken bottles into stained-glass windows , and his wife Anni developed new techniques and textures for fabric weaving . Bayer and Moholy-Nagy experimented with typography and abstract photography , Oskar Schlemmer and Xanti Schawinsky produced abstract stage sets . Painters Paul Klee , Wassily Kandinsky and Lyonel Feininger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . Gropius believes that " the result from a well-oiled team is greater than the sum of their ideas . " The Bauhaus proved him right , for the work produced there in the ' 20s still sets standards for functional elegance in industrial design . He has established no such all-star team at Harvard , but in 13 years Gropius has made it the nation 's No. 1 architectural school . <P> Much remains for his graduates to accomplish , Gropius says . In the U.S. , " you go along a big street that is lined for miles &; miles with filling stations and restaurants that have absolutely no relationship to the setting , a hodgepodge of ugliness ... Or some suburban developer comes along , cutting down the trees , bulldozing the site and befouling our habitat . " A purist with a sad , cold eye , Gropius believes that the main reason for the architectural ugliness he finds everywhere is " inertia of the heart . Man still clings to some visible reminder of Grandpa . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
