Maine 's U.S. Senator Margaret Chase Smith is in close touch with U.S. military reserve programs . Commissioned after World War II , she is now , at 59 , a lieutenant colonel in the WAF reserve . Her administrative assistant , William C. Lewis Jr. , is an ardent Air Force reservist ( " about 90 days ' " training in the past twelve months ) . He was passed over for promotion from colonel to brigadier general last spring-despite the Senator 's persistent efforts on his behalf . Last week , when the promotions of eight other reserve colonels came up for approval by the Senate Armed Services Committee , Senator Smith quickly zoomed in to skip-bomb the biggest target in sight : lanky Cinemactor James Stewart , 49 . <P> Lieut . Colonel Smith admired Colonel Stewart 's fine World War II combat record and his ability as an actor . But why , with 1,900 other colonels up for promotion , was Stewart advanced to one-star rank ? Colonel Stewart , though he flies his own Cessna 310 , had put in only 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been assigned to a key M-day billet as deputy director of operations at SAC headquarters . Lieut . General Emmett ( " Rosie " ) O'Donnell , Air Force personnel boss , disagreed with the Senator . " Stewart has made a great contribution to the Air Force , " he said . " We do n't think we should promote people to general officer merely on the basis of a good attendance record . " But Senator Smith was far from satisfied . As she saw it , Stewart 's promotion was clearly a case of rewarding not the colonel but the glamorous male lead in Strategic Air Command . She grimly put her foot down , and out of senatorial courtesy the Senate committee passed over Colonel James Stewart , U.S.A.F.R. Vacationing in Nevada after a two-week active-duty tour in July with a B-52 outfit in Limestone , Me. , Pilot Stewart landed smoothly . Said he : " I was very honored to receive the nomination by President Eisenhower and the Air Force . I intend to continue to do my best to fulfill my duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> <P> *Stewart rose from private to a much-decorated colonel in the Army Air Forces , flew 20 bombing missions over Germany , became commander of an Eighth Air Force Bi ; wing .
