Few Americans agree on what education is or should be . Throughout the U.S. last week , the West Point scandal ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) was raising dust storms of argument . The dust might obscure the old , sphinxlike questions , but it blended nicely with the U.S. moral climate-which Americans in general found squally , humid and oppressively misty . And obviously education had something to do with that ethical mistiness . Nearly everybody - from editorial writers to policemen-had something to say on the subject . <P> The New York World-Telegram and Sun called " for a rebirth of ethics on American campuses . " To the studentweekly at the University of Virginia , the 90 cadets were " black knaves . " To some sympathizers-and to some of themselves-the disgraced cadets were martyrs . <P> Guards of Honor . Some were inclined to blame the honor system rather than the students . " Its chief weakness , " said Dean Henry G. Doyle of George Washington University , " is that every man pledges himself to be guard not only of his own honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs afoul of the tradition against the tattle-tale . " Added Manhattan Psychiatrist Marion Kenworthy , " We older persons . . . are as responsible as the students when we create psychological temptations . " <P> But wherever they placed the blame , educators knew that the scandal was not West Point 's alone . The subsidized athlete was still a plague , and no one could be so naive , admitted Dean R.B. Browne of the University of Illinois , as to " believe the appearance of a blue-chip athlete on a college campus would take anyone by surprise . " At William and Mary , two coaches resigned last week after the athletic department was charged with faking high-school grades to get promising athletes in . Even parents have been tainted , said Retiring President Alexander G. Ruthven of the University of Michigan : they have come to believe " that their sons ought to be paid for their competition . " <P> Something to Shout About . As for cheating , it is also apparently universal . Yale , troubled by the manners , rudeness and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to issue a warning that it was about to " tighten up . " Other colleges and universities already had their own tight controls . <P> From Harvard on down , most colleges give rigidly proctored examinations . ( " It seems inexcusable , " says the University of Chicago 's chief examiner , " to place the burden of honesty upon the students . " ) Only one university in ten trusts its students enough to maintain an honor system . Crowed the Stanford Daily : " As long as schools like West Point supposedly have an honor code , Stanford need not take pride in the mere possession of one ; but to have one that works-that indeed is something to shout about .
