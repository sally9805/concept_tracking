In barring reporters from the trial of Minot ( " Mickey " ) Jelke III , on charges of being a pimp , Manhattan Judge Francis Valente apparently expected to keep testimony from the sensational vice case out of the newspapers . The trial had not gone two days before Judge Valente had an ample opportunity to see how wrong he was in practice , if not in law . Elaborately shrouded in secrecy , the trial took on an importance it might never have had in open court . In Louisville , a panel of clergymen on radio debated whether the press should be allowed to cover the trial , decided that it should-that a secret trial was a dangerous precedent . British and French newsmen were stirred to cover the trial along with the reporters of U.S. newspapers and press services , and a handful of nightclub columnists , e.g. , Walter Winchell , Dorothy Kilgallen and Earl Wilson , some of whom rarely see the morning light . Even such papers as the Asheville ( N.C. ) Citizen , which righteously proclaimed on its editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy business from the public view , " told its public on Page One the same day : " Call Girl Pat Ward wept at her past today and choked over the names of caf society big shots to whom she sold her love . " <P> Washroom Beat . Forbidden the courtroom , more than 60 newsmen stood watch outside , pounced on everyone who came out the door . Even Columnist Winchell was on hand quipping that Judge Valente apparently thought " little girls should be obscene and not heard , " and feeling right at home in what he called an atmosphere of " opened transoms and peepholes . " <P> Under the court 's rules , lawyers or witnesses could only confirm or deny what newsmen asked them , were forbidden to volunteer information . It turned out to be a broad charter . Before the trial had well begun , it was plain that opposing lawyers notably Pat Ward 's elegantly dressed belligerent lawyer J. Roland Sala ( see NEWS IN PICTURES ) , were letting out bits of evidence to help their side , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each court session , Star Witness Pat Ward , 19 , who had started the whole case by charging that Jelke was boss of a string of $50-to-$500-a-night call girls , hustled to the washroom . There she held press conferences with newshens , while disgusted reporters stood around outside and city desks assigned more newshens to the " washroom beat . " Sniffed the Mirror 's Veteran Reporter Jean Adams : " All this shoving and running around in toilets ! The dignity and prestige of the Criminal Courts Building is gone . " <P> As the press pieced together the testimony , Pat Ward started out on her call-girl career two years ago after she had an illegitimate baby which she put out for adoption . She met Playboy Jelke at a party 17 months ago and , after their second meeting , began to live with him , continuing to ply her trade and giving him some of the proceeds . Occasionally , she let it be known , Jelke beat her when she objected to some of the " Johns " he had arranged for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing a teen-age column for a newspaper to " advise other teen-agers . . . how to avoid the perils of life .
