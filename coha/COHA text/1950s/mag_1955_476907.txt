IT LOOKS as if the 1930s were replacing the 1920s as a favorite setting for novels . That is to be expected . The ' twenties have worn a little thin ( if they were n't a little thin to start with ) ; and , for many of the novelists now coming to their literary maturity , the ' thirties were the highly impressionable years of late adolescence that have always been a favorite subject for fiction . Yet it is difficult to write about the ' thirties in the ' fifties . To an historian writing a thousand years hence the two decades may appear indistinguishable , but to those who have lived through both they seem to be separated by a change in attitude toward almost all the fundamental problems of life ? religion , politics , sex , money . It was probably no harder to be young in the ' thirties than it is in the ' fifties , but it was certainly different . HERMAN WOUK 'S new novel , Marjorie Morningstar ( Doubleday , $4.95 ) , is the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' thirties . Her real name is Marjorie Morgenstern ? Morningstar is the translation of her surname she plans to use in her stage career . Marjorie belongs to the first generation of her family to be born in this country . Unlike the immigrant generation of her parents , for whom the new world was primarily an economic challenge , she sees America as a cultural challenge . For her the theater she tries to crash is partly . what it is for any pretty girl who has a little talent and likes to be admired ? an opportunity for further admiration . But it is also , though she is less conscious of this , a way of circumventing the problems of cultural assimilation . To beestablished in the theater would be to belong to the general American culture ; to be a great artist would somehow dispose of the problem of being a Jewess . Meanwhile she wanders in-a moral no-man's-land , impatient and half-ashamed of the traditional restrictions of Jewish lift , yet tentative and conscience-ridden at breaking away from them . Should she continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nice conventionally religions young men her mother introduces to her at temple dances ? Above all , should she follow the Jewish precepts governing sexual behavior before marriage ? These problems acquire a new urgency for Marjorie when she meets Noel Airman , the director of a theatrical troupe at a summer hotel . Noel is not only a somewhat older man than Marjorie has known before , highly successful with women , a man with ease and grace of manner and a variety of superficial talents , but he also represents the emancipation of the theater , for in choosing the stage as his career he has tried to slough off his Jewish heritage along with his original name of Saul Ehrmann . Naturally he makes a powerful appeal to the whole Morningstar side of Marjorie 's nature , and she is strongly tempted to have an affair with him , especially after she sees from living with the troupe that other Jewish girls of her age have lapsed from the teaching of their religion in more ways than eating bacon . But there is a side of Marjorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product of a long religious tradition and a careful upbringing , and this side of her nature is shocked at the idea of an affair . Marjorie 's difficulty in reaching a decision and the consequences of her decision once it is reached fonts the major part of the novel 's action . Noel is the nearest thing to a failure in characteri ? ation in the hook , not because he is uncoilvincing but because there is not enough energy in him to play so large a part . He is an arty Bohemian who becomes a long-winded bore well before the novel is over . Since the other characters 011 the side of assimilation are even more foolish . the major theme does not have a free dramatic development . In spite of its setting in the ' thirties , Marjorie Morningstar is very much a novel of the ' fifties . This is true in part because the kinds of situations that the reader is likely to think of as typical of the ' thirties do not appear here . The Depression makes little mark on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is about all that happens . There is no sense of public problems requiring public solutions . Marjorie knows a good many unemployed young actors , but the number of young actors who are unemployed at any one time has little to do with the state of the national economy . Even the persecutions of Jews in Germany is hardly mentioned until near the end of the book . But it is in its underlying attitudes that Marjorie Morningstar is most clearly a novel of the ' fifties . It has the rather joyless acceptance of things as they are , the distrust of the untried and unusual , the failure of revolt , that are typical of the present decade . Although there are some genuinely religious characters in the novel , their religion has no prophetic strain ; it is hard to tell where religion leaves off and middle-class respectability begins , For Marjorie 's generation religion underwrites the status quo and offers what comfort it can ; it triumphs farlte de mieux . The sexual morality shows the influence of the New Puritanism ; it is priggish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there is something priggish about finding chastity interesting in proportion to the thinness of the ice it skates over , Marjorie 's definition of chastity is strictly physiological ; she does more necking than any other fictional heroine that comes to mind . If the critic was right who found the surest formula for a best-seller in procrastinative rape , then Marjorie Morningstar should sell very well indeed . Wool ( is at his best in portraying scenes of Jewish family life . The finest passage is an account of the bar mitzvah of Marjorie 's younger brother ? an excellent mixture of true religious feeling and vulgar ostentation , of innocent social climbing and family love . The writing here is very adroit , shifting its tone in keeping with the nuances of the subject ? warm , satirical , reverent , sentimental , and humorous by turns . By far the most winning characters are the members of the immigrant generation , the generation of Marjorie 's parents . They speak with accents ; they have little formal education but a great deal of native wit sharpened on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumes thatthey constitute an argument for middle-class respectability , and in a sense they do , but there is an important difference between them and their children in this matter . For the older generation the prosperous respectability of their lives is not what it is for Marjorie and her contemporaries ? something to be chosen or rejected at will , like an item on a menu . is rather their achievement in life ; it was once their morning star , and to achieve it they have fought tooth and nail . The second half of the novel is the poorer for the disappearance of the older generation from the story . A Book-of-the-Month Club selec-tion , THE GLORY ROAD ' N The Fabulous Train ( Rinehart , $3.50 ) Frederic Wakeman provides another story of the ' thirties . Here the central character is a young man ? one Hal Sample , the fair-haired boy of a tiny Kansas town ? but the central problem is the same as in Marjorie Morningstar : whether it is better to stay within a familiar round or to venture beyond . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freSh bachelor 's degree in physics and the job of selling enough Fords to nonexistent buyers to establish a home for the girl he loves . Then one evening a luxurious train , which ordinarily hardly bothers to whistle when it flashes through town , has to stop on the railroad siding for a hotbox to cool off . Along with the rest of the village underemployed , Hal saunters down to give it the once-over , and it becomes for him something like what the - stage is for Marjorie Morgenstern : a symbol of the unrealized grandeur of life that beckons from beyond the petty and the everyday . At the moment it is particularly poignant to Hal , for he has just received an offer to go east for graduate study in physics , but for economic reasons he can accept the offer only by deserting the girl he loves . Wakeman is good at catching one aspect of the ' thirties ? the hanging around waiting for something to happen , the corrosion of idleness in men who have few resources except work , But in other respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in making Hai an atomic physicist in embryo Wakeman has paid his respects to current interests , as he has even more obviously in Hal 's brief flirtation withCommunism . Hal puts a stop to that nonsense in an embarrassing speech on why Communism can never appeal to an Ali-American boy like himself that sounds like a piece of institutional advertising copy . He is too clearly meant to be a Sample . The plan of The Fabulous Train is dictated by no internal necessity , The symbol of the train comes and goes as arbitrarily as a figure in an allegorical pageant , Even the solution to Hal 's problem of whether to go or to stay is handed in from off-stage by a character who never appears and is fictionally meaningless . In fact , the book reads less like a completed novel than like a heavily padded first chapter for a novel . The biggest wad of padding is pretty funny ; it is a little drama of rustic buffoonery in the manner of Caldwell with a Kansas accent . FACING BOTH WATS BUDD SCHULBERG 'S Waterfront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' fifties marred by the author 's attempt to fit it into the format of the ' thirties . It begins with a long passage written in a. pseudo-folk style , like a " work song " played at some long-ago benefit party for Spanish Loyalists . It is ? in a favorite phrase of that era ? fired with a sense of social injustice , and it does a good job of reporting on a victimized portion of the population . One of the two main characters is a priest who acknowledges his working-class origins and by-passes his toadying ecclesiastical superiors to champion the laborers against the vested interests . Except that the villains are bloated labor racketeers instead of bloated capitalists , the part of Waterfront that centers on the priest might have been written twenty years ago , and it shares a leading moral attitude of that time : good and evil are a question of social justice ; get rid of the bad bosses and all will be well . But intermixed with the priest 's story is another story with another main character , Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here good and evil are a problem of self-knowledge , and recognition replaces reform as the object of moral being . Terry is a baffled tough of twenty-eight whose one chance of glory as a prize fighter is already past . He is torn between the self-protective anti-cup code of a rough and ready neighborhood and the code of an officially Christian society . He does odd jobs for his labor-racketeer brother in innocence of spirit until he has to recognize the consequences of his work . He loves his brother yet hates what his brother has done to hint by making him throw a fight . Terry is not , like the priest , the mouthpiece for a point of view but a potentially tragic creation , though too superficially characterized to achieve tragic stature . There is no real confrontation of the two stories , Terry 's and the priest 's . This is most apparent at the end , which is different from the ending of the motion picture but almost equally unsatisfactory . The ending of the picture , with its triumph of proletarian solidarity , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , the ending of the novel makes better sense but is artistically and psychologically inept because it gives the center of the stage to the priest . For many readers one of the chief pleasures of Watefront will be the opportunity to compare cognate novel and picture . Recollection of the inarticulate eloquence Marlon Brando brought to the role of Terry enriches the novel , and the novel excuses Karl Nfalden 's uncharacteristic performance as the priest . Comparison reveals certain common successes ? chiefly the dialogue , though the same scene is the best scene in both the novel and the picture ( the last encounter between Terry and his brother ) : yet comparison also reveals how different as craftsmen Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg are . Kazan is primarily an imagist . He has a wonderful sense of scene and a weak sense of narrative . Schulberg is much less the artist . He has strong sociological and polemical impulses , though in the figure of Terry he makes a stronger bid for serious attention as an imaginative writer than he has made before . TIME AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $3.00 ) is a book that could only have been written in the ' fifties , for it is a series of speculations about the economic and human consequences of automation ' and the industrial use of atomic energy . Having developed our economy and technology on the assumption that time is a scarce commodity , Soule shows , we now have to rebuild our society on the assumption that time is abundant . What kind of society will it be ? It may be pretty dismal ? without the harsh necessity of working for a living most of our waking hours we may become an aimless and inert mass ruled by a essay , made up of all kinds of odds and ends , sometimes witty and sometimes banal , written in a style that might be called highly nontechnical ( Smile even explains to the reader what the phrase " per capita income ' . means ) , yet far from unsophisticated in sonic of its insights . John Goffe 's Legacy ( W. W. Norton , $5.50 ) by George Woodbury is a good book to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how eight generations of the same family have lived and made a living on a piece of New England soil whose thief economic advantage is a water mill built in 1744 and still going . There are many curious and amusing and even touching things in the book . The finest is the rule laid down by the first John Goffe : " Never take toll from a widow 's grist , or from a man bringing grain on his back . " The best character is an early-nineteenth-century Mrs. Goffe who , in spite of her celebrated sternness , desperately wanted a pair of silk stockings . Logically enough she set about realizing her desire by having one of her boys fetch home some mulberry shoots . Having grown their feed , she acquired the necessary livestock , processed their silk , and knit herself a pair of silk stockings that survived her for a century . Apparently there was time in her life to do it yourself too . TILE TIME-DEFIERS T HER E are three things a man can do without fretting about wasting his time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and technology can significantly increase his productivity only at war . Yet love and art arc still the time-defiers . Recent weeks have seen the publication of a number of books about artists . The best ? because the least replaceable ? is by the artist himself , Sir Jacob Epstein 's Autobiography ( Dutton , $6.00 ) . This is actually a re-issue , with some additional material and many fine plates , of Let There Be Sculpture published fifteen years ago . But time does not wither the Polish-Jew from the Lower East Side who can discreetly condescend to a Duke of Marlborough in his text and immortalize him in an exquisite bronze bust . This is the autobiography of the artist not the man . It contains no personal revelations , but it abundantly documents a career unequaled in modern art for the virulence of its detractors and unsurpassed in modern sculpture for the range and beauty of its accomplishment . . . . Peter Quennell 's Hogarth 's Progress ( Viking Press , $6.50 ) is an elegant example of the lapidary art . It tells you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteenth century , something about Hogarth 's paintings , and what there is to be known ? it is n't a great deal ? about the man who made them . Quennell writes it all as if a crumpet would n't melt in his mouth . . . . In Swift and Carroll : A Psychoanalytic Study of Two Lives ( International Universities Press , $5.00 ) Phyllis Greenacre , a practicing psychoanalyst , takes a professional look at two of the odder gentlemen to make their mark in English literature . Both are sitting ducks for this approach and both have been clipped before , but Dr. Greenacre puts her case well , and it can be read with pleasure by a layman . In the instance of Swift crucial pieces in the biographical puzzle are lost , presumably forever , and so Dr. Greenacre can add little more than a scientific vocabulary to the surmises of Swift 's attentive reader . The comparison of Swift and Carroll yields some surprising parallels . . . . Portrait of Barrie ( Dutton , 53.50 ) is Cynthia Asquith 's sympathetic account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his secretary . Unfortunately these were the dullest years in his life . He produced only two new plays , " Mary Rose " and his failure , " The Boy David , " written for Elisabeth Bergner . Much of his time was given to such activities as cricket , a snobbish infatuation with Eton , and making speeches . This mild and mildly entertaining book is unexpectedly redeemed by an account of Thomas Hardy 's dog Wessex , who did not play cricket but was otherwise loathsome ; he bit mailmen and walked around on the table during dinner disputing their food with the guests . Like all impossible dogs he was madly adored by his owner . . . Aileen Pippett 's The Moth and the Star ( Little , Brown , $5.00 ) is probably the best biography of Virconventional novel of development ; at the end the boy , now a young man , has achieved a maturity of sorts . He realizes that his mother loves him and his father respects him ; they can value the casual creature of their bodies as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
