THE KILL A Story by Kay Boyle Drawings by Rudi Lesser W HEN they first came to Germany with the army of occupation , the boy was six , and all through the first year , and the year that followed , the thought of going hunting was there , casting its shadows of longing like twilight across the bright hours of all that children have to do . He saw his father and the other men go off on Friday nights , or on the eve of an American holiday , wearing their combat boots and their field jackets , and he wanted to put the food he would need , and the ammunition , into the rucksack his mother had bought him to serve the puerile end of picnicking behind the house , and go off with it riding his shoulders as he had seen the others go . " We get across a lot of country in one evening , John , " his father said all that first year to him , or else he said nothing when the boy asked , but went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had shot the wild pig or theroebuck with the night before . He was partly American Indian , a small , strong , muscular man with black hair cut close to his wide , long skull , and copper-colored skin drawn tight across his cheekbones and the high bridge of his nose . " It 's tough on the legs , " he would say , and he would fit a clean white square of muslin into the eye of the steel cleaning rod , and slip the rod neatly into the barrel of the gun , and manipulate it quickly in and out . Or , " You 'll have to wait until you 're older , John , " his mother said in a dreamy voice to the boy , as if speaking of something as far as love or combat to him , as she studied her own young , prettily tinted face in the glass . The father was a master sergeant , and toward six o'clock on Friday evenings in the spring and summer , the other non-coms he hunted with would begin coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Pontiacs , or their Chevrolets parked in the lane , and they would come up the dirt path and crowd into the narrow hallway , and set their musette bags and their rifles against the wall . The boy knew all their faces , and he knew some of the names as well , but he knew best the tumult of their preparations , the stamping of feet from hall to kitchen , and the talk of ammunition , and destination , and what the weather might turn to before dawn . He would wait in the hall , dark-browed , dark-eyed , and troubled , standing close to the burnished wood and the metal of their rifles , brushed by the canvas of their jackets as they passed . " Look at them , " the boy 's mother would say when the time came for them to go . She would stand at the dining-room window with him , watching them in their boots and khaki , their fatigue caps worn casually on the backs of their heads , as they loaded the two or three cars they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lane before the house . " All going off and leaving their wives as if they were sick and tired of them ? " she would say , her glossy hair touching her shoulders , her small voice filled with grief . " Maybe they 're not all married , " the boy would say , standing there in his blue jeans and his faded cowboy shirt , watching them go . " Sure , they 're married . But they do n't care about that . They go off anyway , " his mother would say in bitterness . It was not until after supper , when the stars were out and the cars stood locked and silent before the house , that she would begin to cry . And then it was the second year , and he ? was seven , and one morning in June he and his mother walked down a cobbled street of the hillside town together , and he spoke of the boy's-size rifle that could be sent from a stateside store named Roebuck , if his mother would just sit down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait a while , John , " his mother said . They had come to a toy store as they walked , and she stopped to look at the music boxes , and the farm beasts carved in smooth , white wood , and the cuckoo clocks , and the reflection of woman and boy was there between them and the things behind the show-window glass . The mother was wearing a pale wool sweater , and a rose-colored skirt , and on her feet were suede slippers such as a ballet dancer wears , and she stood there , chewing her gum reflectively . ' ' Look at that darling Little fawn , " she said , but the boy was looking past the wooden animals to the other things that hung inside . He could see tomahawks , cardboard but painted silver so that they had the vigor of weapons , with ' Indian horses splashed in savage flight across their ersatz metal : he could see leather-thonged bows , and painted arrows , and the feathered headdresses of Indians , and , beneath these , the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy myself a music box , " said the mother . and she turned to go through the shop door , touching her own soft , light , un-Indian hair . The German who owned the store stood just below the headdresses and the tomahawks , but so far removed from them that he seemed a figure cut from a newspaper tabloid and placed , as colorless as print , under their barbaric reality . He spoke English in a way the mother did not , and had she referred to this , he would doubtless have told her that he spoke a better English , for what was she but an American who had no right to the English tongue ? He had been a POW in England , he said , as if this were a distinction to which she could never hope to attain . " Gosh , those music boxes are cute ! " the mother said , and then the boy asked her a question about his father 's people . " What kind of a headdress do you think my grandfather wore ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't wear a haddrea ? , " said the mother , but her mind was on the music boxes with the pretty Alpine scenes done on their Iids . " Maybe your grandfather 's grandfather , or somebody way back like that , wore a headdress . My husband , he 's part American Indian , " she said in explanation to thestorekeeper , and he looked at her with a bleak , jaundiced eye . " These come from Munich , " he said , and behind the counter he turned to take one down . He held it before them , the ivory-stemmed , many-colored feathers springing thickly from the headband of green leather , and the strings of beads and the raccoon tails swinging shoulder-length on either side . " The Indian was introduced to Germany by the German author , Karl May , " he said , permitting the Indian no choice of nationality . IN THE end , it was a music box in the shape of a drum and painted mauve , with a mountain chalet done in light and shadow on the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lid of it to take the powder puff out of its circular mauve tray , intricate threads of music were plucked , as if by magic , from within . There were three tunes in it , and the " Blue Danube " was the one that played the longest , and when they were back in their own house in the American community , and the delicate skeins of the tune unwound beneath the powder puff , the mother waltzed slowly through the room , her eyes half closed , her soft hair floating like a young girl 's from her shoulders as she danced . No matter how long she lived , she said to the boy , she would never like anything better than listening to the three small tunes the box contained . " Maybe when you have time , you could look at the Roebuck catalog and ask about the boy's-size rifle , " the boy said tentatively when the " Blue Danube " was done . " Oh , I wish you had some feeling for music , ohn , that 's what I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me sick ! " his mother said , her voice coming the long way back from enchantment to him . She moved to the table , and picked up the little mauve drum , and she turned the silver key tighter and tighter so that the music would play . That was a Friday , and in the evening the sergeant neither the boy nor his mother had seen before walked into the house . He was a heavy , big-boned , slow-moving man who , perhaps because he did not raise his voice as did the other non-coms , or because his eyes , which were yellow as a cat 's eye% moved from object to object in retarded motion , appeared to function in a condition of total repose . He came into the front hall , and he leaned against the wall , smoking slowly , his rile hanging from his shoulder , his bag at his feet . He stood there , immune to the uproar of the others , his eyes looking through the kitchen doorway at the mother in a corn-colored sun dress making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as he looked at the pictures on the wall or at the thin boy in his dungarees . " Ai n't you corning along with us , son ? " he said then , and he stood with his pale eyes holding the boy 's eyes motionless while the stream of preparation moved around and past them in the encumbered hall . " When I was your age , I used to go hunting every Saturday night with my old man . You get some kind of coat on you and come along , " he said , and the boy hesitated only an instant before turning quickly toward the stairs . " I 'll be waiting at the door for you , " said the sergeant , and he was there when the boy came back with his mottled calf's-hide jacket on , and they went together down the dirt path to the cars . The father 's winterized jeep stood by the curb , and the sergeant opened the door of it as if he had done this many times before , and when the boy was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , and he climbed up , carrying his rifle with him , his back and shoulders stooped within the cramped interior , and he sat down on the rear seat by the boy . " My old man used to call it going to the other side of the moon , " the sergeant said . He stretched his heavy , slothful legs across the accumulation of paraphernalia that already cluttered the floor , and his big shoulders pushed against the plexiglass of the rear window , the surface of which had been rendered opaque by days or weeks , or months , it may have been , of rain and dust and grime . " My father tells me about a lot of things , " the boy said . " He says if my grandfather went hunting with us , well , he 'd put his ear to the ground to find out where the roebucks were feeding . " " That was the Indians ' telephone , " the sergeant said . " He was a chief , and I guess he wore a headdress , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German store today . " AN D THEN the father and the others , bearing their variegated equipment , came out of the house and down the path , and the boy 's heart went bleak within him , for he knew what was to come . The father was trimly dressed and belted in his khaki , and his step was quick and light as he came toward the jeep . He laidthe bag , and the binocular case , and the cigar box of ammunition on the motor 's flat , square hood , and , his gun hanging from his shoulder , he leaned in to set these things in place . The muscles twitched in his copper-colored jaw as he worked , but , except for this , there was no sign that he had seen the sergeant and the boy . " I 'm taking this young man out hunting with us tonight , " the sergeant said at last from the shadows of the rear seat . " Only he is n't going hunting , " the father said , and he did not lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , John , " he said . He worked in silence and proficiency , dark-skinned , intent , and , before the boy moved to go , the quality of the conflict altered , for the mother had come on her ballet-dancer slippers through the yard and across the dirt walk to the jeep . " If I stayed home from the show to make them , maybe you could remember to take them with you , " she said , standing incredibly clear-skinned and glossy-haired in the light that had no hint of evening in it , holding out to the father the paper of sandwiches he had /eft behind . Only when the father turned back from the open door did she see that the boy and the sergeant were - seated in the jeep , and the look in her face turned sweet and slightly dazzled in the summery air . " Oh , excuse me ! I did n't know there were people already in , " she said politely . " I ca n't say as he asked me to get in , but / always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lifted his hand slowly and took the fatigue cap off his head . " Only if I had a family , a fine little family like he 's got , I think I 'd buy me a regular car ? " " Oh , his family ! " said the mother in derision , and she touched the ends of her soft hair . " I keep a jeep because it suits me for hunting , " said the father , and , having said this , he closed his mouth again . " Oh , hunting ! " the mother cried out : for whatever the time of year , each was possessed by his own complete desire : the mother for the father to dance with her at the Sergeants ' Club , or to sit close to her in the darkness of a movie theatre , and the father 's longing to move across the fields and through the woods in the twilight of morning or evening , and the boy 's longing for the accouterments of man and his activity . " T do n't recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the mother said , and smiled at the sergeant who sat in the shadows with the boy . " Because I ai n't got a wife , " said the sergeant , stirring gently in his area of quiet . " I 'm in barracks , and I tell you it 's real lonesome there . I guess that 's what led me to take your boy along hunting tonight ? " " Except he is n't going hunting , " said the father . He was ready to leave now , and he straightened up , and he had no time ' to waste . " Why should n't he go ? " the mother cried out suddenly . " Why in the world should n't he go ? " Her slim bare arm in the sleeveless yellow dress moved quickly , and she Hung the wax-paper parcel in past the father onto the driver 's seat . " If some gentleman conies along who 's considerate enough to want to look out for John , why , I think it 's simply wonderful ! I 'm certainly very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning sharply on the father , " wo n't have to be bothered with him at all . And there 's no reason why you should he , is there ? You 're only his father , and that 's really nothing , is it ? That 's nothing at all when rabbits and deer and boar and things like that are running around asking to be shot . Even a wife 's just nothing then , " she said . " Get out now , John , " said the father , his voice as low as if he spoke in the quiet of the forest . " You 're hard on him , ai n't you , Sarge ? " said the other sergeant , but he shifted his heavy legs so that the boy could climb across . " I 'm hard on everybody . You can get out too , " the father said . T H F. B 0 Y and the mother went back into the house , walking a little apart from each other , and the boy went into the dining-room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars from there as , one by one , with the hunters and their paraphernalia in them , they drove away . And the boy remembered another time that could not have been too long ago , for the reality of it had not altered , an evening when he and the father had walked through the woods together , and the silence had parted before them like water parting before a swimmer 's hand . The father had carried no gun that time , but had talked of the way the leaves turned with the wind , saying this meant rain would fall before the night was through . Indian blood , said the father 's voice , will tell you to move upwind , and will tell you not to stalk your enemy before a storm , for after rain he can read the record all too well . And then the silence broke , and a babble of bird tongues filled the forest , and there stood the tough-hidedmonster , the wild , reddish sow , with her forefeet spread , and her eyes of golden glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the father whispered , and his hand touched the boy 's shoulder , and they stood still . " Anyway , I almost went hunting , " the boy said now , but it may have been that he felt the quality of courage disintegrating in him , for he walked out of the dining room , and up the stairs . THE LIGHTS were lit in the windows of the houses of the American community , and in the windows of the German houses across the valley , but he had not slept yet when his mother called him to come and eat . " I made some peanut-butter sandwiches , " she said . They were there on a plate on the oilcloth of the kitchen table , and beside them stood two glasses of milk . She did not wind up the music box , but instead she took out a pack of cards , and she and the boy began playing slapjack as they sat there eating the sandwiches , with their hands slapping hard at the faces of the knaves whenever they played them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , and they turned their heads , and they saw the sergeant who was a stranger to them standing there . He had closed the door behind him , and he stood in the hall with the hunting equipment still slung from his shoulder , holding his fatigue cap in his hand . " Oh , Lord , I must have forgot to lock it ! " the mother cried softly , and the cards fell from her hands . " If you let one come in , I would n't stay long , " the sergeant said in a low voice . " Well , it 's getting late for callers , " the mother said , and the boy watched her shake her hair back like a lovely movie star . " I would n't take up much of your time , " said the sergeant , moving down the hall . " If I could sit down for just five minutes , I 'd tell you what I been thinking about ever since I met you , and then I 'd go away . " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the mother , but she looked with singular pleasure at the sergeant , her chin lifted , her eyes half closed , as the boy had seen her look into the glass . ' ' What kept you from going hunting with the rest of them ? " she said . " A woman , " the sergeant said , and now he had ceased to move again , and he waited in the narrow hail . " If you asked me to sit down , I 'd tell you about her , " he said , speaking very humbly . " There 's an alarm clock on the kitchen dresser , " the mother said , turning her head to look at it . " You can come in and sit down with John and me five minutes , and then you 'll have to go . " " Thank you kindly , ma'am , " said the sergeant . He began to move again , reaching dreamily , lazily , to lay his cap on the coat-rack shelf above his head , slipping the bag and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving carefully , deliberately . Then he came clown the hall toward the woman and the boy who sat in the bright , square box of kitchen light . " This is like coming home , " he said . He drew the third chair out from under the table , and he sat down and folded his arms in the khaki sleeves of his jacket on the oilcloth cover , and he looked at the mother 's face . " Get him a coke , John , " said the mother . As she picked up the scattered playing cards to lay them straight , the sergeant kept his eyes on her narrow , white-skinned hands . " T do n't want to drink nothing . I just want to sit here dwelling on things , " said the sergeant gently . But still , once the boy had opened the bottle and set it down before him , he lifted it and drank . " Thank you , son , " he said , and he looked at the mother 's face again . She was straightening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay warm under her eyes . " Sometimes a man 'll go so blind he wo n't see the treasures he has right under his own roof , " he said . " Get the sergeant an ashtray , John . Maybe he 'd like to smoke , " the mother said . " I do n't want to smoke , " the sergeant said , but still he took out a cigarette , and lit it , and then he broke the match in two , and dropped it into the ashtray the boy had put down on the cloth . " I wanted to know one thing . I wanted to know the name and the location of the German store in town where they got them Indian feathers . I want to buy them , that headdress , for the boy . " He took the cigarette from his mouth , and his yellow eyes were on the mother 's face as he held it out to her across the oilcloth , and across the hits of peanut-butter sandwiches still left on the plate . " I lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a low voice to her . When the mother reached out for it , her hand was trembling , and her eyes were held by the sergeant 's eyes as she put it in her mouth . She drew a deep breath of the smoke in , and then she turned her head and spoke to the boy , and her voice was trembling and light . " You 'd better go upstairs to bed , John . It 's getting late , " she said . The boy waited a moment , still hoping she ' night say the store 's name where the feathers might be bought , but she did not say it . She was looking in weakness and helplessness at the sergeant , and the boy went down the hall , his eyes on the sergeant 's rifle on the coat rack , and he went up the stairs . T H A T was Friday night , and on Saturday the shabbily-garbed offspring of the American army of occupation played their wild games in the yards and streets of the community . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holsters hung at their hips , and the imitation ivory revolvers these encased were bejeweled in emerald and ruby and topaz . Dogs raced behind the fences of the individual yards , yelping for freedom , and others ran with the children  --  boxers , and wire-haired terriers , poodles , spaniels , dachshunds , or schaeferhunds , each dog in itself the indite of the temperament of the humans with which it lived . Little girls , wearing blue jeans only a few sizes smaller than those their mothers wore , followed , the shifting center of agitation , pushing their burdened doll-coaches and whispering together , forever lingering on the outskirts of the games the cowboys played . The boy was out with these others in the tide of sun , ready to lash or be lashed to the stake for burning , or to draw his jewel-studded pistol from its holster and menace the girls from ambush as they came . The mothers were down the hill at the commissary , getting the weekend groceries in , and the fathers were gone  --  they were off in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from daily liability . The German housemaids had ceased their work , and they leaned their strong , bare arms on the windowsills , and , wooed by sunlight , they called their own language out above the Midwestern or the Southern sound of the children 's voices , and the barking of the dogs . " Lise ! Helga ! Erika ! " the maids called to one another , and the German delivery men on the American milk truck that had halted at the end of the lane called out : " Lise ! Helga ! Erika ! " in falsetto mimicry . The milk truck was khaki-colored like an army truck , and its windows were barred like the windows of a prison-van , but on the rear door of it was painted a pink-legged stork , better than life-size , with its eye cocked , half in sagacity , half in humor , and in its beak it held the four ends of a folded diaper in which were borne bottles of milk for the children of the American community . " HeIgal Lise ! Erika ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men jumped onto the truck and slammed the barred doors closed . The motor throbbed , the gears changed slowly , and as the truck jerked into motion , and the big wheels turned , a wild , stricken cry was heard on the bright air , a cry so alien to the medley of other sounds , so wounded in its anguish , that the truck ground to a halt again , and the men jumped down . T HE THING that had cried out in fierce reproach lived still . It was a wire-haired terrier , part white , part black , which must , a little while before , have tired of playing and flung itself down , panting , in the truck 's area of shade . And now , still panting , it made its way across the lane , and its entrails followed , writhing with their own hot life as they whitened in the dust . The first sharp note of terror had ceased , but a wail of indescribable mourning came now from the bright-tongued , dripping mouth , a long , outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be traded in for death with this breath or the next because of one fatal instant of immobility . The German maids were fixed like images of women in the open windows in the sun , and the three men from the milk truck stood mute before the spectacle , their hands fumbling in their pockets for cigarettes , while the dog sought to sit on the soiled , flattened rags of its hind legs , and could not , and turned , snarling and snapping in frenzy , seeking to tear the dusty strings of its own vitals away , Even the little girl whose property he had once been watched tearless and in silence , as the cowboys watched . But it wasthe children who knew what there was to do . They held the dogs back by their collars , striking the muzzles of boxers , or poodles , or schaeferhunds when the high whining of curiosity whistled too loudly through the eager snouts , and they spoke cautiously together , as if in church , and then the boy turned to the men . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so he 'll die ? " he said . For a moment the three Germans did not speak , and the dog turned its head again and snapped at its own disemboweled and living substance , its eyes glazed sightless with pain . Then the tallest man , wearing glasses , opened his mouth as if he had an answer to give , but instead he straightened a cigarette out in his fingers , and put it between his lips . The driver of the truck smoothed his brass-bright hair hack with the palm of his hand , and ran his tongue along his lip , and looked at the other men , but he too did not speak . The third man was dark , with a slender , sunburned neck and square brown hands , and he wore the anciently but snappily cut black breeches and the high military boots , now cracked with wear , that father or uncle or history had bequeathed to him . Having no military decorations to embellish what he wore , he had stuck two daisies , with a length of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , I 'll shoot him , " lie said , his accent as good as an American 's , and the boy turned swiftly , and ran through the sunlight toward the locked , silent cars that waited still at the far end of the street , swerved between the last two , and then raced through the gate of his front yard , and up the path , taking the corner to the back door fast . T HE WALTHER pistol was kept in his mother 's and father 's room , on the top shelf of the clothes closet , strapped in a leather holster and concealed , for safety , under a pile of folded , khaki handkerchiefs . He knew he could reach it by standing on a chair . Twice his father had taken it out before him and cleaned it , and showed him how to handle it . It would be loaded , for the father kept it loaded ever since burglars had broken into the house , but the magazine safety would be on , and . no cartridge in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chair and reached into the corner of the shelf for it , and he could feel the blood pounding in his eardrums as he touched the smooth leather of the belt and holster with his groping hands . Then he was out again in the sunlit lane , and nothing had altered . The maids waited motionless at the windows still ; the knot of children had not unraveled ; the shadow cast by the halted truck , the Germans smoking their cigarettes , the residue of the dog 's life staining the dust , were all unchanged . the dog lay propped on its front legs , its wild tongue panting , its lips drawn back from its white teeth as if preparing to laugh aloud . " You 'll have to release the safety , " the boy said as he took the pistol out of the stiff , tan , leather pocket that strapped it fast . " Okay , " said the dark-haired German in the knee-high hoots . When he cocked the pistol , the children did not move . It did not occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The German held the pistol at arm 's length and took careful aim while the cowboys stood , holding their own clogs by the collars as they watched , or holding to their scooter or bicycle handle bars , and the girls to their doll-buggies in which their soft-skinned , life-size infants rode . And the terrier looked with his unhinged , frenzied eyes at the disaster which seemed scarcely to be his as it lay discarded in the dust behind him , and his bright , young mouth was still ready to laugh . The boy put his hands deep into the pockets of his blue jeans , and he closed his fingers tightly in his palms as he waited for the sound to come . But the German did not fire . Instead , he lowered the pistol , and he turned toward the boy . " If the MPs come along , I 'll get into trouble , " he said , the cigarette jerking on his lip . But they wo n't see you . They 're not around here , " the boy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of houses where the maids leaned eagerly from the kitchen windows in the sun . " There 's too many people watching . They 'd all tell who done it when the MPs asked , " he said , and he took the stub of the cigarette from his lip , and let it fall . " But you 've got to shoot him . You 've got to do it , " the boy said , his voice gone high . " And if I do n't get him the first time , then I 'll have to shoot again , " said the German , and he gave a short laugh . " That 'll be giving the MPs two chances to hear . Or maybe the shot goes wild and hits the street , or hits a rock , andbounces back , and one of the kids gets hit instead . " When he lifted his hand to draw the back of it across the sunburned square of his forehead , the two daisies on their tough , green stalk fell from behind his ear into the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right , ? said the tall German who wore glasses . " It 's verboten for any Cherman to have a firearm , " the blond one said . " Okay , then let me have the pistol , " said the boy . He held it in his right hand , at arm 's length front him , and there was no color left in his face , but his aria , his hand , were steady as he aimed . " Does he know how to shoot ? " the tall German asked , looking anxiously through his glasses at the other children . " Sure , he knows how to shoot . His grandfather was an Indian once , " a cowboy said . And then the blast of it came . The boy heard the snarl in the terrier 's throat , and he lowered the pistol , and he saw that the dog lay on its side , and the panting had ceased , and the shape of laughter was stiffening on its mouth . " You got him right between the eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , and stooped in his ancient military boots to see . N SA T U R DAY evening , at supper- time , the doorbell rang , and the sergeant whose face they were beginning to know walked in as he had done the night before , and hung his cap on the clothes rack in the hail . You should n't have come back , " the mother said , standing bare-limbed , her feet in gilded sandals , bare-armed , in a pink summer dress , holding to the kitchen table for support . " I had to come back , " said the sergeant . " I 've been thinking about it all day . " " About what ? " the mother whispered , and her eyes moved on his face . " About last night , " he said , standing big and indolent before her . " I know , I know , " whispered the mother , and the sound of her voice died . And on Sunday evening he came back again , and , as had happened before , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the mother sent the boy upstairs . " The sergeant has to get to bed early too , so hell be leaving any minute now , " she said . But on Sunday night it was different , for the hunters returned late from the woods , and the tumult of voices as they started their cars in the lane outside and called out to each other woke the boy from sleep . Once they had gone , he lay listening to his father 's voice , speaking from the jeep , or from the hall , and he knew that at least one man had staved with him . And then he heard the drag of bodies as the dead beasts were carried in , hearing even that intermission in their work when this father and the other Man paused to open a bottle in the kitchen , and the sound of the sliding panel of the dresser as his father took the glasses out . Twice he heard the slamming of the refrigerator door , and then the whine of the spigot as they ran the water over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the hall again , his father and the other man , and , with his head raised from the pillow , the boy could identify each move they made . Now they were lashing the four feet of the roebuck together so that it might he hung in the cellar from a ceiling hook , and the boy heard the grunt of their breathing as they stooped , the scrape of their shoes on the stone of the cellar stairs as they bore the roebuck down . They made the journey twice , stopping to drink again in the kitchen after they had brought the second body in from the car and laid it on the floor . So it would be a boar and a roebuck , he thought , for two roebucks were not allowed one hunter . And suddenly he did not want to think of the lifted guns , and the animals panting out their- lives , and he turned his face to the pillow to keep the sight away . BUT STILL he lay listening , and after this work was done , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again into the kitchen , and their voices murmured as they drank . In the end the other man went down the hall , and out the door , and the boy got from his bed , and moved in the darkness across the bare boards to the window . He watched the headlights brighten the lane a moment , and the last car go . Now only his father 's jeep was left by the curb , and his father moved in the kitchen , and the boy heard the mother stirring in her room , she too having waited perhaps , listening , as he had listened , for the last hunter to go . He heard her seeking her slippers and dressing gown , and then she went softly down the stairs . " Oh , my God , there 's blood all over ! " she said , not having reached the last step yet . " All right , " said the father , speaking from the distance of the kitchen to her standing on the stairs . " I 'm , a hunter , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a little vain . " I 'm also a good sergeant . I 'll clean up any muck I 've made . " " Who came back with you ? " the mother said . " A friend , ' ' said the father , and then there was a pause , perhaps as he lifted the glass from the table and drank again . " A friend who does n't talk out of turn to other men 's sons , and does n't I VI 1 get lonely for other men 's wives . Next time he comes , tell him to take his cap with him when he goes . " " Well , I 'm sure I do n't know what you 're talking about , " the mother said . And now the lather walked out of the kitchen , and into the hall , and his footsteps halted near the stairs . " Do n't be frightened . The killing 's over , " he said , and the mother gave a little cry . " You 're hurting me ! You 're hurting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , there 's the blood on the floor . So maybe there wo n't be a next time . Maybe we finished him off , " said the father , speaking savagely . " You would n't have done that ! " the mother cried out , speaking scarcely aloud . " You 'd better not look in the cellar , " the father said , and the boy heard him jerk the sound of laughter out . " Well , that sergeant , " said the mother , and her voice was dimmer , farther now , and the boy knew she must have moved down the hall into the kitchen , and had perhaps sat down at the table where the sergeant had eaten with them , perhaps even taken the father 's glass up in her hand . " He came back to get the name of the German store where the Indian headdresses are . He wanted to buy John one . That 's all he wanted , " she said . " An Indian headdress made in Germany ! " said the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your veins does n't mean wearing feathers pulled out of a German turkey 's tail ? " " He just asked the name of the store , and then he left . He 's going to buy it on Monday for John , " said the mother , speaking softly , as if in grief , perhaps nursing the glass in her slender , white-skinned hand . I ET HIM bring it here . I 'll shoot him through the heart as he walks through the door , " said the father , and the boy stood in the dark of the upstairs hall , listening to bins speak . " Having Indian blood means the country comes to life for you , even this cursed , devil-ridden country , this country of barbarians , " he said . " Not the people 's faces , or their language , all light , riot that , but my blood gives me what 's in the grass and sky and trees . As Icing as men keep quiet , I can remember all the signs , and all the memories that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and grandfather 's , but older than that . I can read the stars the way they did , and shoot just once , and kill with that one shot , because my blood remembers that they did . " And , Maybe she 'll tell him , the boy thought , standing in the upstairs hall ; maybe she 'll tell him about the dog , and that I could n't stop crying after she came up the hill . Maybe she 'll tell him T kept on seeing him panting , he thought , but the mother must have been thinking of other things , for she did not speak . " I got a boar and a roehuck this time . The others got zero , " the father was saying , but saying it softly , without vanity . " They have n't got forest-sight . " The sound of it paused , and after a moment , the boy heard him set the bottle down on the table , and the water from the spigot running into the glass . " Nobody can take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I go out in the woods , and it 's there , and there 's nothing else , and the year , the country , and woman , even , they 're wiped out . I 'm a man alone , and I need to eat , and I 'm going to kill in order to eat , and I shoot just once because I know distance , and light and dark , and my hunger 's as steady as my eye . And then Icome back to this ! " He broke it off suddenly , and the laughter jerked out . " To a hall with a sergeant 's cap hanging in it ! Listen , " he said , and his fingers may have closed on the mother 's arm again , for she gave a little cry . " I am my father 's son , and my son is my father 's grandson , and whatever I have , it was given him too . When he goes hunting , my son , he 'll go when he 's ready for it , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , " he said . The boy listened in the dark of the upstairs hall , and he thought : Maybe when the stain 's gone from the dirt out there , I wo n't see him sitting up panting . Maybe when it starts raining , and there is n't any more dust on the road , I 'll stop remembering . In the kitchen , there was the sound of water gushing into the pail , and then this ceased , and the father walked out into the hall and set the pail down , and the scrubbing of the boards began . Maybe this year he 'll teach me how to read the stars , he thought , and I 'll learn that , and maybe next year will be different , and I 'll want a gun again . " Listen , - the mother said from the kitchen . " I bought one of those music boxes . You know , the powder-puff kind . I 'll play the ' Blue Danube ' for you . It 's the prettiest thing you 've ever heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the father , scrubbing the wood . As the delicate threads of the tune unwound , the boy went back to his bed again , and he lay clown without pulling the covers over him , and lay looking at the dark in the window that was richer and deeper than the bedroom dark . Every now and then the father would halt in his scrubbing of the hall , and the boy could hear the whisper of the mother 's feet as she danced across the floor . He hair would be floating free of her shoulders , and her pale silk dressing gown swinging around her , light and wide , and the boy felt a sense of peace laid like a cover over him . The door downstairs was closed against the night , and against any stranger who might come , and his mother danced , and , because of the whisky she had drunk , her eyes would be heavy , like a dreamer 's eyes . " Kiss me , kiss me , John , kiss me , " she said to the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fix me another drink , " said the father after a moment , and his voice was not the same stoke . " I 'll waltz with you , baby , once I 've got the barracks clean , " he said .
