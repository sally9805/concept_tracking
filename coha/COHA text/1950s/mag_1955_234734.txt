Because European art is in the doldrums , Americans are turning increasingly to the art of the East , for both diversion and inspiration . In the past three months , Manhattan has seen no less than 16 exhibitions of Oriental art . Last week Manhattan gallerygoers crowded two shows that uniquely bridged East and West . <P> Both were important sculpture exhibitions , and both were by Japanese-Americans : Isamu Noguchi and Ruth Asawa . <P> Noguchi , 50 , has long been recognized as a leading U.S. sculptor . Born in California , he spent his grammar-school years in Japan , his high-school years in the U.S. <P> and his most fruitful years of study under Abstract Sculptor Constantin Brancusi in Paris . A consummate technician , Noguchi has variously turned his hand to fashionable portrait busts , abstract stone sculptures cut with a diamond saw , furniture , paper lanterns and stage sets . Since 1950 he has spent half of his time in Japan ( where he married Screen Star Yoshiko Yamaguchi ) , concentrated on deliberately crude ceramic sculptures molded from the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ceramics in last week 's show were mainly semi-abstractions of figures and faces . They looked lumpish and exuberant at once-like the gingerbread cookies of a playful and somewhat inebriated baker . <P> Ruth Asawa , 28 , is a San Francisco housewife and mother of three . She was born and raised in California , studied under Abstract Painter Josef Albers at Black Mountain College . Her show consists of big , wholly abstract sculptures , made of woven wire and suspended from the ceiling . If Noguchi 's ceramics demonstrate a certain grinning bounciness in the Japanese heritage , Asawa 's wire constructions show the opposite side : austerity and calm . In their openness , delicacy and symmetry they somewhat resemble blossoms , odorless , colorless , outsize , yet refreshing to contemplate . <P> Noguchi and Asawa share one quality of Oriental art that Western artists often lack : economy of means . Their Japanese ancestors devoted vast efforts to making a single brush stroke look easy . By confining themselves to simple shapes made of patted mud and woven wire respectively , Noguchi and Asawa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work . Judged by one standard test of art , i.e. , the proportion of visible effort to effect , their sculptures stand high .
