Under the firm hand of Communist Leader Laurent Casanova , some 70 French sculptors , painters and art critics got together in Paris last week for what was loudly proclaimed as " an exchange of views . " Net result : everyone signed a letter listing the things all good artists should be for &; against . What they were against : 1 ) the Korean war , 2 ) U.S.-made A-bombs , 3 ) the " horrors of bacteriological warfare . " What they were for : " An art which will draw inspiration from socialist realism and be understood by the working class . " Among the signers was one French artist who has tried just about everything except the flat , travel-posterish style of " socialist realism " and who has never seemed to worry much whether the working class understood him or not . His name : Pablo Picasso .
