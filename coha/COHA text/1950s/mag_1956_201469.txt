What were the two intertwined figures doing on the park grass in the heart of Amsterdam ? Burgomaster Arnold D'Ailly bustled up for a close look last week , and turned a fiery red . Sculptor Jacques Lipchitz had called his big , blocky , semi-abstract bronze The Couple , and it was all too clearly a labor of love . The burgomaster ordered the sculpture removed that very night to the museum cellar from which it was borrowed . <P> <P> The Couple had been the central attraction of a park show of modern statues . Discovering that it was gone , six Amsterdam sculptors , whose works were also included in the show , called a protest meeting . The meeting soon adjourned to the park itself , where the sculptors helped one another remove their own six works . <P> " We 'd all intuitively reached the same decision , " one of them said later . " Maybe the burgomaster 's action can be explained , but for us it 's indefensible . The Lipchitz is a fine bit of plastic art , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most everybody thought it was a turtle . " Another added : " The Couple was a pretty statue , and it looked just fine the way it stood there . I do n't know what the burgomaster should have done , but it was a real nice show and it 's a pity it had to end this way . " <P> Sculptor Lipchitz himself was far from the scene of the fracas , working at home in Hastings-on-Hudson , N.Y . When he heard the news , the fierce , brilliant old Frenchman grinned like a turtle . " How touched I am , " he said . " How warm in my heart . " <P> <P> Lipchitz remembered The Couple well . While he talked of it , his hands shaped the air as if he were caressing his bronze : " I made it in 1928 . That summer I had lost my father and , three weeks later , my sister . I was desperate . But then my optimistic nature came out : I saw that life must go on . From this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statue expresses . It is lovers , which means affirmation , but it also looks like an animal in pain . This is because life is a tragic scene and a hopeful scene both at once . So now some people say the sculpture is obscene ? That 's very interesting . I do n't understand people . Nothing more pure ever came out of myself than this work . "
