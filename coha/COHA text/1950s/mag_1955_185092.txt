With no louder fanfare than a polite clearing of its throat , Manhattan 's Tiffany &; Co. last week conducted a bargain sale , the first in its 118-year history not occasioned by a move to new quarters . Behind the sale was a change in policy brought on at stiff-backed Tiffany 's by Board Chairman Walter Hoving , whose Hoving Corp . bought control of the firm in August ( TIME , Aug. 29 ) . There was also a merchandiser 's desire to get rid of $340,000 worth of china and glassware that was not moving , along with items of jewelry and leather goods . Among the bargains : a silver tea set that had been on the shelves for more than ten years , cut from $12,500 to $6,000 ; a gold compact , from $2,375 to $1,500 ; a diamond-studded emerald brooch , with a stone that was once part of a Turkish sultan 's belt buckle , from $36,300 to $29,700 . <P> The sale was a success . All 265 half-price handbags went in two days . By week 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glass was gone . But the high-priced jewelry was still awaiting takers . On Saturday , black-suited doormen counted 2,400 customers , more than on any October day before . <P> In the midst of the sale , 65-year-old President Louis de B. Moore retired after 44 years with the company . Into his place stepped Executive Vice President William Thompson Lusk , 54 , great-grandson of Founder Tiffany . Lusk , born in Manhattan , went to Groton and Yale ( ' 24 ) , was coxswain on the Yale freshman crew and president of the dramatic society , once played daughter Goneril in King Lear . After college he started at Tiffany 's as a clerk , worked his way steadily up to executive vice president in 1952.
