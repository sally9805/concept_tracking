On the remote , jungle-hemmed beach of Tortuguero , south of Veracruz , a handful of Mexican and U.S. oil drillers slapped each other 's backs and shouted with hoarse joy . A few weeks ago , boring at an angle to a depth of 6,000 feet under the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico , their rig had tapped a pool of rich green-black petroleum . Last week Tortuguero No. 1 surged into test production at a steady 500 barrels a day . <P> Tortuguero was the first producing well to be explored and drilled in Mexico with U.S. capital since ex-President Lzaro Crdenas expropriated foreign oil companies ' properties in 1938 . The well contributed its bit to the rise in Mexican oil production , which has soared from an average 130,000 barrels daily in 1946 to an all-time record last fortnight of 229,000 barrels a day . <P> New Brightness . The man mainly responsible for the new brightness of the Mexican oil picture , and for the reappearance in it of U.S. operators , is Antonio Bermdez , 53 , a handsome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government oil monopoly , Pemex , a few days after President Miguel Alemn took office in 1946 . <P> In the eight years that had then passed since expropriation , Mexico 's aging equipment ingeniously held together with baling wire had barely managed to keep established wells producing ; hardiy anything had been done in the way of new exploration and drilling . With cabinet rank to help him make needed changes and deal firmly with the high-riding , left-wing oil union , Bermdez brought in 51 producing wells in 1947 and 83 more the following year . In 1949 , Pemex added 180 new wells to bring national production to an estimated 60 million barrels for the year . <P> New Fields . Bermdez says that he spends about 99% of his waking hours thinking about Pemex . Three days each week he visits oil regions in his DC-3 , " El Petrolero " ; the rest of the time he works hard in Pemex ' pseudo-colonial , four-floor office building on Mexico City 's Avenida Jurez . He often dashes over to the Casa Crema for a conference with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bermdez ' shrewdest strokes . The first group to begin work , in June 1949 , was the Mexican American Independent Oil Co . ( C.I.M.A. ) , an operating unit jointly set up by the Signal Oil &; Gas Co. , the American Independent Oil Co. and hustling California Oilman Ed Pauley , who had had previous experience in Mexico . C.I.M.A. was allotted an unexploited area along the Gulf in the states of Veracruz , Tabasco and Campeche for exploration and drilling . After payment of their expenses , the Americans will collect 15 to 18% of the new wells ' income for 25 years . C.I.M.A. hoped to bring in a gusher in Campeche before the end of January , expected to start drilling on Tortuguero No. 2 in a couple of weeks . <P> Said Antonio Bermudez last week : " We have every reason in the world to be optimistic ... In 1950 we should be able to average 250,000 barrels a day . Within the next 60 days we will be able to announce three important new contracts with United States groups .
