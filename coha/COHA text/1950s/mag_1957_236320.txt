The night after Syrian army leaders came home from Moscow with a promise of $100 million in arms , the Syrian army intelligence service broadcast a fantastic " communique " from Damascus . " O people ! " it said , " a mean imperialist plot " has just been discovered . At least three members of the U.S. embassy staff in Syria were said to be involved . " At the helm of the conspiracy , " said the Damascus radio , was Second Secretary Howard Stone , " a most skillful expert " who had " hatched " plots before in the Sudan , Iran , Guatemala . Only the day before , said the communique , " this Stone " had set up meetings in Damascus between two young Syrian officers and two Syrian " reactionaries " and promised them $300 million to " stage a coup and make peace with Israel .

It expelled the Syrian ambassador , Dr. Farid Zeineddine , a garrulous and haughty diplomat who has never been a State Department favorite anyway . It was the first time the U.S. has declared a chief of mission persona non grata since Robert Lansing handed the Austro-Hungarian ambassador his walking papers in 1915 . The State Department also announced that U.S. Ambassador to Syria James Moose ( one of only three U.S. ambassadors in the Arab world who can speak the language ) would not return to his Damascus post at the end of his present home leave . <P> And that was about all the U.S. felt able to do last week about a gratuitous insult that rose out of a scrap among young Syrian army leftists , who currently wield power but do not have responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their country into the Middle East 's first Soviet satellite that to hang a big lie on the U.S. is to score a point or two in the infighting . The army intelligence crowd , led by the mysterious left-winger , Colonel Abdel Hamid Serraj , 31 , put out the plot story in an apparent effort to eliminate any opposition to the big , impoverishing arms commitment that Defense Minister Khaled el Azm had made in Moscow . The army chief of staff resigned , and General Nafif Bizri , 43 , a friend of Serraj and widely regarded as a Communist , was named chief of staff . Ten high officers were kicked out of their jobs .
