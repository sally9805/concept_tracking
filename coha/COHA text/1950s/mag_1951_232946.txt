Skeet+ is trapshooting with frills , designed to make trapshooting as much as possible like game-bird shooting . In skeet 's basic 25-shot round , each shooter follows an identical routine : 1 ) two single shots , from each of the eight field stations , at clay pigeons sprung into the air from each trap house at 70 m.p.h. ; 2 ) double shots from stations 1 , 2 , 6 and 7 , at birds sprung simultaneously , one coming toward him , one going away ; 3 ) an optional shot from any station ( bringing the total to 25 and usually taken wherever the gunner misses his first bird ) . <P> In Dallas last week , 400 of the best U.S. gunners met to shoot it out for the National Skeet championships ( broken down into age , sex , gun-gauge , amateur and professional categories ) . A perfect round ( 25 hits , no misses ) is fine shooting on anybody 's skeet field . But a 25 was commonplace to the eagle-eyed marksmen who blasted away at the Dallas Gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in years . <P> Family Show . All week the skeet fields ( 24 in all ) were circled by processions of competitors aiming at prizes in 38 major events , popping pump-gun .410s , banging cannonlike 12-gauges . Whole families were part of the show , fathers , mothers , sons &; daughters , teaming up or competing against each other . <P> Some of the youngsters gave their elders some real scores to shoot at . Edward Harris , a twelve-year-old Galveston boy , knocked down 100 of 100 birds in the Sub-Junior championship for a new world 's record . In the Junior division Robert Smith , 16 , from Silver Spring , Md. , hit 248 out of 250 for another world 's record . <P> Glamor in Tweed . The tournament glamor girl was Cuban-born Carola Mandel , 31 , wife of wealthy Chicago Department Store Owner Leon Mandel . A skeet shooter for only three years , steady-nerved Mrs. Mandel is already right up in the big time , last month won the Open High-Over-All title at Chicago , outshooting some veteran male marksmen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt &; tweed skirt , despite the heat , she won the 20-gauge ( 100 out of 100 ) and small gauge ( 98 out of 100 ) competitions , for a split of the major women 's titles with Mrs. R. H. Hecker of Tucson , Ariz . Of the big 12-gauge gun , Carola says : " It begins to get very heavy and very long after a little while . " <P> On the last day , Staff Sergeant Glenn W. Van Buren of Fort Worth 's Carswell Air Force Base was tied with four others after a perfect 200-for-200 score in the All Gauge division . He had lost out last year because he missed one bird . But this year he never wavered . When the din and the powder smell had faded away , he had raised his score to 250 out of 250 in the shootoff , to become the first three-time champion ( 1948 , 1949 ) in National Skeet history . <P> <P> + From the Norwegian word skytte ( shooter ) .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
