txt Maglages based solely on romantic love are headed for the rocks , Dr. David Mace , professor of human relations at Drew university , Madison , N. J. , told delegates aCr tending the annual convention of the International Union of Family Organizations here today . Mace , 47. former general secretary of the national marriage guidance council in London , is a graduate of Cambridge , London and Manchester universities . He became a Methodist minister in 1928 , and spent four years of his early ministry in London . He left England in 1949 to take his American university appointment . " In the past , the prevailing view of marriage was based on the utilitarian theory , " Prof. Mace said . " Marriage was seen as a mutual exchange of services between a man and a woman on the general principle of ' I 'll scratch Your back if you 'll scratch mine . ' Not So Any More " Sexually , the woman gave the man what he wanted ; she was not supposed to have sexual needs of her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children . He provided her with economic security and protection . In return she cooked his meals and sewed the buttons on his shirts . " In the age of nylon , careers for women , free lov e and scientific contraception , the practical incentives which once propelled men and women into marriage have lost much of their pull , he said . Says He Is n't Cynical " Many of the utilitarian ends which marriage met so admirably in the past can now be met as well , or almost as well , outside marriage , " he explained . " The g r and motif now is the cult of love . You marry today not because I of services exchanged but because you are feeling blue without your sweetie pie . " Mace denied he was cynical about love . " I believe it is a very noble and beautiful emotion and an important element in the making of a marriage . " he said . " But I am simply stating a fact when I say that it is not an emotion which is self-sustaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do not last , "
