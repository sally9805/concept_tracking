After all the tumult of Asia , Dwight Eisenhower stepped out of his special train onto an enormous red carpet in Paris ' Gare de Lyon to a reception correct in its pomp but cool in the reserve visible in the face of Charles de Gaulle . Despite their old acquaintance and friendship , the Presidents of France and the U.S. were cast willy-nilly as antagonists in the bitterest conflict in the history of the ten-year-old Atlantic alliance . <P> Four days before Ike 's arrival , as Cabinet members and top military brass of 15 nations descended on Paris , the annual NATO Council meeting had opened . The setting was glossier and glassier than ever before . To replace the sagging " temporary " prefab it has occupied since 1952 , NATO now inhabits a six-story , A-shaped ( for " Atlantic " ) building containing $10 million worth of Danish and Belgian furniture , German and Dutch electronics devices , Italian marble , British kitchen equipment , U.S. airconditioning , and ( alas ) a French telephone system . But as if to prove Parkinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first sessions in NATO 's new headquarters involved a skittish probing of the basic military and political assumptions on which NATO rests . <P> France Alone . Fifteen months ago , France 's De Gaulle opened his demands that NATO have responsibility for coordinating Western policy all around the world . Instead of confining itself to averting Soviet aggression in Europe , he argued , NATO should bind its members to support one another 's interests everywhere-and specifically to support France in revolt-torn Algeria . To frame common NATO policy , De Gaulle suggested the formation of a three-power superdirectorate composed of the U.S. , Britain and France . <P> With the outspoken support of the British ( who did not want to share a favored position ) and the smaller NATO powers ( who did not want to be further left out ) , the U.S. ignored De Gaulle 's proposals . Partly to put pressure on Washington , partly because he is convinced that " France must defend itself by itself and in its own fashion , " De Gaulle retaliated by striking at the foundation stone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationally commanded defense force . <P> De Gaulle began by withdrawing much of his Mediterranean fleet from NATO control . Then he refused NATO permission to stockpile U.S.-controlled atomic weapons in France . And for the past year he has obdurately blocked the plans for integrated air defense of Europe advocated by NATO 's European commander , U.S. Air Force General Lauris Norstad . <P> Of NATO 's Continental members , France is the only one that has refused Norstad authority to send its planes into immediate action in event of a Soviet attack , the only one that has refused to hook into the Europe-wide air-warning-and-command net that NATO hopes to finish building by 1961 . ( Given the small size of Western Europe-Paris lies only 350 miles from the Communist frontier of East Germany-this is roughly like refusing to agree to coordinated air defense of Chicago and Minneapolis. )
