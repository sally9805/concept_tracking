and they penetrate to the Pacific Coast . It is as if the South were a huge , overflowing reservoir of young humanity . The Southern states pour out beautiful blond children in an endless stream . The smaller their income , the more inaccessible the place , the larger the family . This is no figure of speech . It is a fact . Here are a few figures taken from the latest available census : The child population under eighteen years of age for the whole United States is 546 per 1,000 . South Carolina has 881 , Mississippi 817 , Alabama 807 ; Kentucky comes next with 782 , North Carolina has 776 , Georgia and Arkansas are nearly even with 759 and 753 . And so it goes to Texas 659 and Missouri 625 . Contrast those figures with Nevada 177.3 , New York 170.8 , or Connecticut 169.7 . Negro children are included in these statistics ; but at present the Northern migration is preponderantly white ? and it is about the whites that I am writing here . Since there is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities . MAGAZINE D URING a year 's trip all over this country during the war , writing on industrial problems , I came across Southern workers everywhere . I remember the manager of the bus station in Mobile , Alabama , who complained about the damage to the plumbing : " We could n't figure how the flush tanks over the toilets got broken off all the time . It was from those up-country boys taking the toilet bowls for a place to wash their hot feet and sitting on the tank . You know how there 's always a pail of water outside the cabin door and Ma hollers to the men , ' Wash your feet . ' So they thought that was what the toilets were for . " I remember , too , the old man in the Kaiser shipyard in California who said he 'd got to be leaving to support his old woman who 'd been supporting him all the time he 'd been working for Uncle Sam at the shipyard . " Now her feets give out waiting on table , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Pop , " they asked , " what did you do with those blue slips we gave you every two weeks ? " , ' ' Took good keer of ' em just like you told me . Got ' em all saved up in my wallet here . " Many of the Southern workers , like this old man , had never heard of a check . Many had never had " folding money " before . Few of them knew how to buy ; they only knew how to spend . " You see that fellow there ? He paid a taxi twelve dollars to bring him up here , " said the proprietor of a trailer camp . " Could n't wait for the bus that runs every hour . Yet I 'll have to watch to see he do n't take away the blankets when he leaves . He 's one of those who 've never stayed above two years on a piece of land , and it 's his nature to move on . " These workers who are making our great industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from remote mining camps , from coves and " hollers " in the hills , from the Ozarks , from river bottoms . They come from families of tenant farmers and sharecroppers in the deep South , ever more of whom are being tractored off the land . They come from lonely communities , where there are cut-over forests , played-out mines , and poor land . These people ? most important to the nation because they are destined to make our industrial cities ? need help , both in health and education , beyond that which their states can give them . II T o KNOW how these people live at home , one must leave the highways for dirt roads which look like the classic one that turned into a squirrel track and ran up a tree . Often when the car can travel no further , one must go on foot up the trails leading to isolated cabins . Last summer we walked up such a steep and stony road which led to a Kentucky mining camp . At Cameron 's , our first stop , teen-agers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely twenty years ago when I had last visited these parts ? climbed the steep hillside . Cameron , a craggy giant of a man , held forth about his prowess " in the old days when we had the troubles " and he " told ' em from the co'tehouse steps . " " Did n't no one tell me to stop , " said he . " ' Do n't tech him , ' says Shurf to the deppities . ' They 's three hundred miners right yere tear you in pieces of inny one lif 's a finger to him . ' " Here in Bell County people were killed in strikes , as they were in Harlan County before the United Mine Workers was established there . This is the part of the country where the name of John L. Lewis is the most revered . But for him they all would be in poverty , they believe firmly . " John L. Lewis , " proclaims Cameron in the voice he used on the co'tehouse steps twenty years ago , " is the greatest man this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin D. Roosevelt ai n't a great man , " he adds magnanimously , " but whar 'd I be , whar 'd inny one on this mountain be but fer John L. Lewis . I git my $100 a month pension . " " You did n't git it whilst the strike was on , " interposes Mrs. Cameron , drawing a lovely strawberry blond grandchild to her . " Look down the hill at thet cabin , " he goes on , ignoring her . " That 's a miner 's widder . See them children a-suckin ' ice cubes on the gallery ? Whar 'd that ' lectric icebox come from an ' the washin ' machine to my back porch ? But fer John L. Lewis nothin ' but graveyards ' ud prosper in this county ! " John L. Lewis notwithstanding , the medical situation is n't bright . " Usta be a doctor in every mining camp by law before there was roads ? now one doctor looks after ez many camps as he kin . We got a doctor to 5,000 miners right yere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of the night , " adds Mrs. Cameron . " He gits three dollars a year per every miner , sick or well , " Cameron counters . And then , as we prepare to leave , " Do n't go , " says Mrs. Cameron . " Stay the night . " These gracious words , or at least " stay and eat , " are routine in the mountains . D OWN at Gorman 's , on the way to the branch , the gallery is crowded with children . Gorman , a personage in his own right , is the local lay preacher and a good union man . He might have been a labor leader but held off " because of his children ; he could n't afford to get in wrong , " my guide tells me . Gorman sits with his two-year-old on his knees and fondles him . This baby and the four-year-old are so beautiful you can hardly believe it . His wife , Ara Ellen , holds the littlest baby . Seeing him , one feels that the hand of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man sitting a long afternoon among his children on his porch , a baby on his knee . He does n't have to be off somewhere in a car or to listen to the radio or peer at television . He does n't even need to read a paper . His life centers in his home , and the life of his children pulses around him . Everywhere on this trip the young children appear more serene and happier than do those of one 's well-to-do friends . Everyone who has seen them talks about the calm integration of these children with their families . There is little evidence of the domestic tantrums and antagonisms which make parenthood the strenuous thing it often is among middle-class people . Of Gorman 's ten children , seven are at home , the rest are already in the cities . Ten people live in the ramshackle and unpainted cabin . There is no running water but they have electricity now , for the camp has rural electrification . " We live ' bout ' leven miles from inny town in this mining camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four children to school . Come back word from teacher they all need teeth 1 fixin ' . Got three little kids not yet school age . Who 's agoin ' to take them children to the dentist and back ? Who 's agoin ' to pay for ' em ? I ai n't got through payin ' yit fer my las ' baby . " Over across the street a group of adolescent boys are playing , heads bent together . " What are they doing , " we ask , " playing cards ? " Gorman 's eldest daughter answers briefly . " Gambling ! " she says . " Quarreling , readying for a burial ! " For this has been violent hill country , and by the time children reach their teens , they often begin to revolt against the strict code of their parents , many of whom belong to churches of the old-time fire-and-brimstone variety and frown on dancing and even motion pictures . The rigid religion of the elders often cleaves a chasm between the generations . Boys get " mean " and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took us over a precarious plank bridge , down a path near a spur railroad leading to a mine . There was no path to the battered cabin ; an entanglement of wires kept out trespassers . The owner of the house , Jessie , carne to meet us : life had dealt hardly with her . An odor of poverty came from the disordered house . But Maie Jo of high school age was pretty and neat and , like most of the younger generation , had a home permanent ? which made one recall a teacher 's heartfelt plaint , " Oh , if the dentists would only do as good a job advertising as the beauticians . " " Jessie has sort of given up ; she 's let herself go , " my friend tells me later . " Why should n't she , with that neurotic husband of hers ? " Three of Jessie 's children are married and living in Detroit . We saw a picture of her three handsome grandchildren . Ed , her oldest boy , a veteran , had come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat and clean as Ed himself , with something good cooking on the stove , and three beautiful children . One of them was a child I will never forget , a little girl of thoughtful beauty and perfection of body , and with a proud way of walking , and , like so many of these mountain children , neither shy nor bold : reserved , friendly , with her place in her own world secure as the earth she stood on . Ed makes violins . " A fellow busted my fiddle so I tuk an ' mended it . Soon I was a-makin ' fiddles . I usta like the git-tar , now I do n't keer fer nothing but fiddles . " He and his wife sang some hillbilly ballads . " He learned to sing hillbilly in the Army , " his wife said . Wherever we went the picture was the same : floods of beautiful blond children who grow up into restless youngsters and go off to fill the cities of the North . THAT great gains have been made in recent years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were reminded of these gains when we spent the night in Hendersonville Settlement School. , which opens its hospitable doors to all visitors interested in its work . This school today has four hundred day students who come from mining camps and nearby towns by bus over the newly opened road , and some twenty boy and girl boarders who stay the year round . ( These are orphans , or children from broken homes . ) Twenty-five years ago moonshining was practically the only way ' of making a living among the two thousand people of the Locust Hill area . Literally everyone moonshined , including the preacher . I was in this part of the country twenty years ago and people in the towns of Middleboro and the county seat of Pinesville told lurid tales of the goings-on in this tough , feuding community , which was nicknamed " South America . " But Parson Hiram M. Frake decided that something should be done . So he went up into the mountains on a mule to talk about a school . " A posse with guns met me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonshiner and outlaw , Henderson , came to his aid . " My children need a school , " he decided . " ' Light and stayl ? ' Henderson gave the land for the first school ; the school building was a cowshed which the parson spent the summer cleaning . The school got its money through the Kentucky Mountain Missions of the Methodist Church . How the Hendersonville Settlement School grew , how it added building after building , and how it transformed this lawless moon-shining community is part of the American epic . The first Sunday in October 1925 a handful of sunbonneted women and mountain men with guns came to hear the parson 's first sermon . This was a time when men stacked their guns outside the church and when a mountaineer would " sooner leave hispants home than his gun . " There was no sanitation in the mountains , there were no doctors . But Parson Frake had a dream of what education and enlightenment could do for this community . It included scientific agriculture , and in this he preceded the county agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to revolutionize the countryside . Blood feuds cleared . Moonshiners one after another smashed their stills . On his recent twenty-fifth anniversary , the notables of the state were among the five thousand visitors . T HE improvement in basic conditions was once more manifest in the Sum- merfield community in upland Tennes-see , which during the depression had had 70 per cent of its people on relief at one time or another . It was then that the sage of Summerfield said , " It takes a sharp axe , a strong back , and a soft head to cut bugwood at 75 cents a day " ? the WPA wage . One who had known Summerfield in depression days would hardly recognize it now . Formerly , rickety unpainted cabins were the rule . Now , even in this hard-pressed county , houses had been enlarged and many cabins were covered with an imitation brick facing , unlovely but a mark of prosperity . Here too , in the Highlander Folk Nursery School , the children were as calm and harmonious as the miners ' children a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school teacher to pick up the children , one of the mothers said to us : " I kai n't spare Maudie Mae or Jimmie today . They got ta he'p whilst I put in my garden . " " I got ta tend the baby , " said the five-year-old with immense self-importance . " Jimmie , he helps me plant . I plant and he tamps after me . Jimmie loves to tamp . " Jimmie was no bigger than a minute . These children of three and five already had their important place in their world where they felt needed . Yet even here in Summerfield , the health conditions ? though incredibly better than during the depression ? are still none too good . You get an inkling of the sanitary situation when you visit the nursery school , where , in a fine modern building with plumbing , the children ask , " May I go outdoors ? " Some of these children have so many sores and scratches that it would take a teacher her day to tend all of them . You find there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those hills . Down at the county seat , you learn that the health services have not improved during recent years . Formerly there were three doctors in the county . Today there is one , who is also the public health doctor and serves still another county as well . There used to be a county nurse , but there has been none since the war . ( I met Miss Bessie , the first county nurse , who even now , at seventy-five , helps out in emergencies . ) This county has no prenatal care . The school children are tested for TB and receive the Schick test and inoculations against diphtheria ; but the nearest hospital to the community of Summerfield is far away , and the Highlander Folk School station wagon often is called on to act as an emergency ambulance . As in many other poor Southern communities , biscuits and gravy and kraut are still the backbone of the diet . Pellagra lurks among a few old people . There are plenty of communities tucked away in the hills of the Appalachian plateau where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much less a county nurse . A CCORDING to a recently published study made by the American Academy of Pediatrics what was true in this isolated Tennessee county is true throughout the rural Southeast , where nearly a third of our American children live . Of these the vast majority are in isolated and semi-rural counties . Here , where families are largest , the infant mortality rate ? always a reliable yardstick ? is much higher than in the greater metropolitan counties ; here too children receive one-third less medical care than those who live in or near cities . There is no Southern state which up to now has been able to finance state-wide maternal and child health services , though the 1950 amendment to the Social Security Act will be a great help . This amendment was the only legislation for health or educational services which was passed during the last Congress . MAGAZINE In some Southern communities ? many of whose residents have no toilets at all ? hook worm is prevalent . In some , the old killers , smallpox , typhoid , and diphtheria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are disregarded . In a bayou parish in Louisiana , a single public health doctor serves 100,000 people . Over 40 per cent of rural women do n't have their babies in hospitals ; in Kentucky , 44 per cent do not . The need for better schools follows the pattern of the need for better health facilities , as one can see by the midcentury report of the National Education Association . At a time when there has been a steady drop in the percentage of the national income spent on education ? in 1930 , 3.09 per cent went to education ; in 1940 , 2.88 per cent ; today , only 1.84 per cent goes ? it has been , by and large , the schools in isolated districts , and especially in farm areas , which have suffered most , and are in bitterest need of assistance . In the Southern rural districts the fifteen-and sixteen-year-olds are often still in grammar school , frustrated and bored at an age when they are already thinking about marriage . Or else they have left school entirely . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Horry County , South Carolina , found that most of the thirteen-and fourteen-year-olds were not in school ; of 238 pupils in the eighth grade , one-third did not enroll the next year . Nor is Horry County an exception . ( What the Alliance is doing to alter this picture is another and inspiring story . ) W HEN the Southern worker moves to the North , his casual attitude toward school attendance goes with him . In one of the primary schools in Detroit , the majority of whose children are from the South , the teacher reports a 62 per cent turnover of pupils in a semester ! " Please excuse Emma May for not coming . She was up late at a singspiration , " the note to the teacher reads . " We sing all night , " Emma May explains . " It gets louder and louder ! It 's beautiful ! I was up till twol " Parents are annoyed when truant officers tell them their children have to go to school , or that the children 's heads need washing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " a father asks a school teacher with the impatient indulgence reserved for the pernickety . " You got lice , I got lice , everybody 's got lice ! " " We never know when our children will suddenly move out , " the principal of Jefferson School told me . " About a third of our children are from the South and their parents get up and go without warning . " Jefferson School is a center of light in a crowded downtown district of Detroit where Southern workers abound . The health conditions in this district are dismaying . According to the 1947 figures , the infant mortality rate was 43.4 as against 31.7 for the city of Detroit , and 20.5 for a good residential district . Still more striking was the TB rate : 46.1 for the crowded area , 35.6 for the city as a whole , and 7.7 for the residential district . No wonder the Southerner who moves here feels that he is in alien country . Too often he has exchanged a piece of land for an automobile , the warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Forced out of his homeland , he finds himself unable to put down roots in the flinty soil of the industrial city . T HE Southern hill-country picture is far from all black , however ; it sparkles with points of light . I have already spoken of the general rise in the standard of living . But one thing above all that stands out in most brilliant relief is the value of individual effort . Some one person , here or there , has decided to take matters into his own hands , and a countryside has beenchanged . I have mentioned Parson Hiram Frake ; there have been many others . Mrs. Sally Adams with her beautiful one-room Park Settlement School in Happy Hollow , Tennessee , is one . Dr. Lillian Johnson , who gave the school and grounds to Myles Horton for the Highlander Folk School eighteen years ago , is another whose life has had a far-reaching influence . The Highlander Folk School is the only labor college in the South and works with the grass-roots leaders of farm , labor , religious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on horse- and mule-back have saved countless lives in Leslie County , Kentucky , and beyond , was founded and is supported through the efforts of Mrs. Mary Breckenridge . Schools and sanitariums ? each founded by the devotion of a single person of vision ? dot the countryside . There is an intricate pattern of aid to these Southern communities ? of efforts and contributions which mesh together ? aid from individuals , from distant communities , from local groups , from state and federal government agencies . I do n't believe that the like of this interweaving has ever been more fruitful . But more , much more needs to be done . In its last session Congress teetered on the brink of passing bills which would safeguard children 's health and give much-needed aid to schools , but it failed to act . Public interest may help greatly in getting these bills passed . This is not simply a matter of aiding a baCk . ward region ; it is a matter of protecting a great reservoir of our future national population .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
