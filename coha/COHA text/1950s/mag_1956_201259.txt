THE SECRETS OF CAROLINE CniRiE ( 309 pp. ) - Cecil Saint-Laurent-Crown ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> It is 1812 , and Napoleon is advancing upon Moscow . Mere versts away , within the Russian lines , French Agent Caroline de Salanches is retreating equally rapidly from Prince Michael Dubrovin . During an orgy at his estate , Prince Michael has exposed Agent Caroline . In fact , he has left her without a stitch of covering above the waist . The air is filled with shrieks , screams and wolfish roars as the Russian nobility , ever lovers of traditional customs , pursue nude serfs round and round the banquet hall . But Caroline is resolved at least to keep her head . As Prince Michael bears down upon her , his " greedy and sarcastic gaze " inflamed with " voluptuous contempt , " Caroline puts a torch to the hangings . Gusts of fire sweep the room . Amid shouts , pistol shots and clouds of alcoholic smoke , Caroline legs it from the lodge , with Michael in hot pursuit , " howling like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <P> Caroline Chrie , as she is known to countless thousands of Frenchmen , always wins-not least when she chooses to surrender . She is like the heroine of an old movie serial , with the important difference that where the movie heroine was chained fully clothed to the tracks to be torn asunder by the Santa Fe express , Caroline is generally denuded by pursuers intent on joining her in union specific . As she herself sportingly admits at a critical moment ( she is hanging almost naked from a rafter in a subzero temperature ) : " There is something better to do with . . . women than to kill them . " <P> Since World War II the French have agreed so warmly with this attitude that Caroline has become French fiction 's most popular heroine . The novels in which she appears ( The Secrets is the third to be published in the U.S. ) have had sales of more than a million . <P> The reason is that though the Caroline novels are blatantly aphrodisiacal in intent , they are more than mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian as well as an able hack . <P> At 37 , he has published more than 80 books under 20 names , including a sober study entitled When France Occupied Europe ( 1792-1815 ) . Consequently , when he makes Caroline an eyewitness to Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow , he knows what that eyeful was . Every page of Secrets is dotted with the stock characters of romantic fiction-dashing lieutenants , gallant generals , evil-faced spies and slimy turncoats-but Saint-Laurent trots them out with verve , gives them real jobs to do . The most dignified historian might respect Saint-Laurent 's dramatic , spine-freezing account of Boney 's awful homeward trudge , which would teach most schoolboys a lot more than they would get from most textbooks . Unfortunately , the frequent appearances of Caroline , strangling her ravishers with whips and pointing loaded pistols at them from her naked hip , make this novel unsuitable for school study .
