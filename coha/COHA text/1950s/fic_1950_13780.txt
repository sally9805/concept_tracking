( excitedly ) I got a new idea for my last chapter . It came to me just as I reached the bend in the river . EDITH PRENTISS ( wistfully ) The path is so beautiful along there . LANGLEY PRENTISS I always get my best ideas walking . EDITH PRENTISS Oh Langley - will I ever walk again ? No - do n't tell me . I know the answer - never ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( disturbed - then going on ) I want to start working on this right away - while it 's hot in my mind . Where 's Sidney ? EDITH PRENTISS He 's gone to get some fresh flowers for me . LANGLEY PRENTISS Oh Edith , you are always taking up his time with trivialities when I need him ! EDITH PRENTISS He 's my secretary just as much as yours , Langley . I hired him to help me run the house - write my checks - and - LANGLEY PRENTISS But my work is important ! ( as she takes up her book to read ) Important ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 EDITH PRENTISS ( indulgent ) Why , of course , Langley . LANGLEY PRENTISS Always that indulgent voice ! ( mounting irritation ) Here I am - engaged in a monumental work - a book that may change the course of history - and you act toward me with the tantalizing indulgence one gives to a child . EDITH PRENTISS Oh no , Langley . LANGLEY PRENTISS You 're not the only one . Everyone treats my work as though it were a fool 's idea . Everybody except Sidney . That 's why he 's so valuable to me . He understands the importance of my work . EDITH PRENTISS I know he 's of great help to you . LANGLEY PRENTISS It 's not so much what he actually does . It 's the atmosphere he creates - an atmosphere of respect - deep respect - which is necessary to me - to everyone - if - EDITH PRENTISS ( intensely ) I know . He works a kind of magic ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( crossing to the fire ) Well - I suppose there is nothing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her book ) What are you reading ? EDITH PRENTISS ( reading - as though listening to an inner voice ) " Neither love me for thine own dear pity 's wiping my cheeks dry . A creature might forget to weep , who bore they comfort long , and lose thy love there ! But love me for love 's sake , that - " p. 5 LANGLEY PRENTISS That 's old hat , my dear sister ! Women these days do n't love like the ecstatic Mrs. Browning ! EDITH PRENTISS ( excitedly ) No ? Then why did they crowd into a theatre by the thousands to see a play about her ? LANGLEY PRENTISS They crowded in by the thousands , my dear sister , to see a play about a woman taken out of her misery by a man . That 's every woman 's dream ! It was Kitty 's when she married me , it --  EDITH PRENTISS Kitty was never in misery . ( suddenly ) Oh Langley - this is the first time you have mentioned her name since - LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tea , shall we ? EDITH PRENTISS Not yet . LANGLEY PRENTISS Why not ? EDITH PRENTISS I 'm expecting a guest . LANGLEY PRENTISS Who ? EDITH PRENTISS ( on the defensive ) Mr. Erich Erdmann . LANGLEY PRENTISS Oh , your junkman ! EDITH PRENTISS ( desperately ) He is not a junkman , Langley ! p. 6 LANGLEY PRENTISS He sells old furniture ! EDITH PRENTISS Langley ! He is the greatest living authority on early American furniture in the world - LANGLEY PRENTISS What is a European an authority on Americana ? EDITH PRENTISS I do n't know , Langley but he is ! He is also a man of wide culture and exquisite taste - and he was also a very rich man till the Nazis took everything the possessed . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( surprised ) Is he a Jew ? EDITH PRENTISS No - but his wife was and he refused to divorce her . LANGLEY PRENTISS Is he bringing her to tea ? EDITH PRENTISS No - they killed her . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( taken back ) Oh - well ( pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 'd never suspect he 'd suffered all this to see him . EDITH PRENTISS That is why I like him so much , Langley . I can only feel at home the people who have been hurt by life - as I have . And I can only admire those who have born it with courage - as I have not . LANGLEY PRENTISS I think you 've done very well , Edith . p. 7 EDITH PRENTISS No , Langley ! Twenty-two years I 've sat in this little chair - twenty-two years - three months - and six days - and there is n't one hour that I have n't cried out - inside - and - LANGLEY PRENTISS I know , sister . ( pause ) What are you going to get from Mr. Erdmann today ? EDITH PRENTISS I want a little desk . LANGLEY PRENTISS A desk ! Where are you going to put it ? The house is full now - you EDITH PRENTISS I 'm making Mary 's old room next to mine into a small sitting-room . LANGLEY PRENTISS What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? EDITH PRENTISS Sometimes I like to be alone , Langley , and so do you . LANGLEY PRENTISS Where is your new nurse going ? EDITH PRENTISS I 'm not getting a new nurse . LANGLEY PRENTISS What do you mean ? EDITH PRENTISS Just that . LANGLEY PRENTISS Who is going to take care of you ? EDITH PRENTISS I 'm going to take care of myself ! p. 8 LANGLEY PRENTISS That 's ridiculous ! EDITH PRENTISS ( voice a little higher ) I can dress myself ! I can stand ! I just ca n't walk , that 's all ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Who is going to lift you and  --  EDITH PRENTISS Sidney . LANGLEY PRENTISS Sidney ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes , he 's been doing it ever since Mary went to the hospital . He always lifts me . LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes , he lifts you . EDITH PRENTISS What are you trying to insinuate ? LANGLEY PRENTISS ( serious ) This ca n't go on , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS What ca n't go on ? LANGLEY PRENTISS This intimacy ! Yes ! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been here . That I find very repellent and dangerous ! All this thing of making a little room is for him ! - to be alone with him ! EDITH PRENTISS It is so that I can be away from you ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Thank you . EDITH PRENTISS Forgive me , Langley . p. 9 LANGLEY PRENTISS ( bursting out ) You do n't know anything about him ! For all you know he may be a crook ! You hired him without recommendation ! You - EDITH PRENTISS That 's not true . LANGLEY PRENTISS You told me that . EDITH PRENTISS I should never tell you anything ! You always use it back at me. ( patiently ) He had no written recommendation - no ! But the agency had rung up the British Embassy in Washington and they confirmed that he had been what he said - secretary to Mr. Neville , when he came here on a mission . LANGLEY PRENTISS Why did n't he have that written by Mr. Neville then ? EDITH PRENTISS Because he did n't go back to London with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRENTISS Because he wanted to stay in America . Enter from the hall door , SIDNEY . Sidney is an Englishman between 30 and 40 years old , graceful in all his movements and extremely good-looking in an almost exotic way . He comes on carrying some letters - and some flowers , crosses directly to Edith . EDITH PRENTISS ( giving him a quick look of pleasure ) Oh , Sidney , how nice . You are back . p. 10 In the tone of her voice and the way she looks at him there is immediately established a sort of secret understanding between them that has never been expressed . This understanding on her part approaches adoration . On his it is an extraordinary subservience . Her voice when she speaks to him is filled with happiness , and his when he speaks to her is always soothing , caressing . LANGLEY PRENTISS At last ! SIDNEY Am I late ? LANGLEY PRENTISS You 've made me wait . SIDNEY I 'm sorry , sir - if you were inconvenienced . EDITH PRENTISS You got lovely flowers ! SIDNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon mail , Miss Prentiss. ( gives her letters ) LANGLEY PRENTISS Anything for me ? SIDNEY No , Sir . LANGLEY PRENTISS Nobody ever writes to me ! SIDNEY That 's because you are too busy to write to them , Sir . LANGLEY PRENTISS Exactly ! ( going on - pleased ) I want to rewrite that material I dictated this morning.I want to emphasize the - p. 11 EDITH PRENTISS ( interrupting ) Here 's a letter from Jean - want to hear it ? LANGLEY PRENTISS What does she want ? EDITH PRENTISS She wants me to send her a dozen young roosters . LANGLEY PRENTISS To Mexico ? EDITH PRENTISS ( reading her letter ) Yes - by plane . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( disgusted ) Roosters ! What for ? EDITH PRENTISS She wants to give them to the people in the village to improve their flocks . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( glumly ) I knew she 'd want something out of you . EDITH PRENTISS ( on the defensive ) She invites me to come down and spend the winter with her . LANGLEY PRENTISS In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you when she was here this summer ? EDITH PRENTISS Oh Langley ! You always think of a bad motive . ( suddenly ) I think I will go down and spend the winter with her ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Nonsense . p. 12 EDITH PRENTISS Why is it nonsense ? LANGLEY PRENTISS You ca n't take a trip like that ! Alone ! EDITH PRENTISS Then I 'll take Sidney . Would you like to go to Mexico , Sidney ? SIDNEY With you , Miss Prentiss ? Indeed ! LANGLEY PRENTISS You ca n't have Sidney . EDITH PRENTISS Why not ? LANGLEY PRENTISS ( impatient ) I need him - and you need a nurse . EDITH PRENTISS ( struck - but carrying on gallantly ) That reminds me ! Get Mr. Hathway on the phone , will you , Sidney ? SIDNEY Your lawyer ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes - Hathaway , Gianelli , Freedman and O'Reilly . It 's in the book . SIDNEY ( dialing ) I know the number . LANGLEY PRENTISS Edith , you ca n't take this trip . Jean must be mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all planned ! She says she will meet the plane with her car and drive me to her settlement . p. 13 LANGLEY PRENTISS It 's in the hills with the Indians ! Suppose you get sick . EDITH PRENTISS She is a doctor . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( making a frustrated , impatient gesture ) But  --  SIDNEY ( taking the phone to Edith , it is on a very long cable ) Mr. Hathaway on the phone , Miss Prentiss . EDITH PRENTISS ( smiling up to him ) Thank you , Sidney . ( in the phone ) Mr. Hathaway ? This is Edith Prentiss . Yes , yes , thank you . - Mr. Hathaway , you know my old nurse , Mary - yes , the one who has been in the hospital - she wants to go home to Ireland and I would like you to fix it for her . Get her a plane ticket and send her a cheque every month . Oh , I do n't know . Whatever seems to you right - I 'll send her down to you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Do n't be stingy ! - No , I do n't think she will come back . She says she wants to die at home . Yes , of course - the bequest remains in the will ! That she leaves me does n't make any difference . She served me faithfully for years . Good ! Thanks ! ( she hangs up ) LANGLEY PRENTISS The way you throw your money around ! p. 14 EDITH PRENTISS It 's my money ! ( she hands the phone back to Sidney ) SIDNEY May I take you for a little drive now , Miss Prentiss ? EDITH PRENTISS Oh it 's too late now , Sidney . It 's almost tea time ! SIDNEY I 'm so sorry . I was gone so long ! Shall I lift you to your couch for a little while ? Would n't that rest you ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes , it would rest me . Thank you . ( he lifts her very tenderly from the chair and puts her on the couch , putting her rug around her ) ( when Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip pocket to the floor . Langley who has been watching the lifting disapprovinly - sees it -- sees what it is - quickly picks it up ) LANGLEY PRENTISS What 's this ? A letter to me ! from London ! You said there was nothing for me . SIDNEY Oh Mr. Prentiss - I 'm so sorry - I forgot it . LANGLEY PRENTISS Did it just come ? SIDNEY No sir , it came this morning . LANGLEY PRENTISS Why did n't you give it to me then ? SIDNEY You were concentrating very deeply at the moment , Sir - I did n't want to disturb you . p. 15 LANGLEY PRENTISS So you put it in your pocket ! SIDNEY Yes , Mr. Prentiss . LANGLEY PRENTISS And forgot it ! SIDNEY Yes , Mr. Prentiss . Miss Edith needed me at the moment - and - LANGLEY PRENTISS And Miss Edith is more important than I am ! SIDNEY Oh no , Sir . I esteem you equally ! LANGLEY PRENTISS It all sounds very unlike you , Sidney ! Till now ! Very unlikely at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRENTISS Sidney will you be good enough to tell Clara to serve tea at the moment Mr. Erdmann arrives . SIDNEY Yes , Miss Prentiss . He goes . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( opening the letter excitedly ) This is a letter from London - from Mr. Neville - about your Sidney . EDITH PRENTISS How does this happen ? LANGLEY PRENTISS I wrote to find out about him . EDITH PRENTISS When ? LANGLEY PRENTISS When I began to realize what was brewing here . p. 16 EDITH PRENTISS Oh , Langley ! If you only had something to do in life , except to pry into other people 's business ! Ca n't you let things alone ? Let a sleeping dog lie ! No ! You have to pry and kick ! It 's dangerous ! It always comes to a bad end ! You did the same thing with Kitty . You were not satisfied until you had dug back into her life ! stripped everything from her ! till she lay there naked ! - naked and dead ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Are you insinuating I had anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted her with her past ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes , and she just laughed at me ! EDITH PRENTISS That lovely laugh ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Laughed ! " You ca n't bring me down , darling , because men loved me . I know my worth . " EDITH PRENTISS You see , you did try to bring her down ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Well I did n't succeed ! She just flaunted that string of pearls she always wore . EDITH PRENTISS Her rosary ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes - her rosasy ! Can you imagine any woman calling such a thing a rosary ? Pearls from lovers ? Yes ! That 's what she said that day - " Everyone of these perfect pearls was given me by a man who loved me - and valued me - as you should , darling . " p. 17 EDITH PRENTISS She was valuable . And you did n't value her . LANGLEY PRENTISS I married her , did n't I ? EDITH PRENTISS You married her because she was Lady Kitty Ashton - and you are a snob , Langley . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANGLEY PRENTISS Why should I ? From the first moment I saw her sitting alone there on that terrace in Nice - her little child beside her - she represented womanly purety to me - mother-hood ! All of it ! How was I to even imagine that from the time she was eighteen - she - EDITH PRENTISS And you scold me for taking a secretary without --  LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes ! Do you want to hear this letter ? EDITH PRENTISS No . LANGLEY PRENTISS Well , I 'm going to read it to you anyway because it 's necessary that you know what it says . It 's from Neville 's secretary . ( he reads ) " Considering the man , John Sidney , we really know very little about him here . Mr. Neville acquired his services in India as interpreter on his last mission there , and he proved so generally useful to both Mr. and Mrs. Neville that they took him on with them to America - where he disappeared . " ( to Edith ) You hear that ? p. 18 EDITH PRENTISS Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( reading on - more impressively ) " He is an Anglo-Indian ! - son of a part-native woman and a wealthy Englishman - a cotton merchant in Bombay . Although illigitimate he was given an excellent education by his father whom he very much resembled . In fact  --  brought up as a gentleman - but later - disowned . " EDITH PRENTISS That was exactly the history of Edgar Allan Poe ! - brought up in luxury - and then - disowned . Could anything be more cruel . Go on . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( reading ) " Except for those failings characteristics of his background - he proved an excellent secretary . EDITH PRENTISS An excellent secretary ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( impressive ) Except for those failings characteristic of his background . EDITH PRENTISS What does that rigamarole mean ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Does n't it say anything to you ? EDITH PRENTISS Just English prejudice and snobbery . LANGLEY PRENTISS You have not been in India as I have ! p. 19 EDITH PRENTISS I have n't been anywhere ! LANGLEY PRENTISS You have n't seen the stinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen the sex symbols everywhere worshipped as sacred objects - the holy temples carved with obscenity ! - the - EDITH PRENTISS No , I have n't seen anything of that ! But I have read the poetry of Tagore . LANGLEY PRENTISS You are hopeless ! ( going on ) Did n't you hear the word " disappeared ? " EDITH PRENTISS Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS Does n't that say anything to you ? EDITH PRENTISS What ? LANGLEY PRENTISS That he is undependable , unreliable and - ( suddenly ) Did he tell you that he is part native ? EDITH PRENTISS No . LANGLEY PRENTISS Then a liar as well ! EDITH PRENTISS I did n't ask him ! It never occurred to me . He does n't show it ! LANGLEY PRENTISS I 'm going to fire him right now ! ( rings bell ) EDITH PRENTISS Not without giving him a chance to explain ! That 's not just , Langley . p. 20 LANGLEY PRENTISS Well ! I 'm going to confront him with this letter . EDITH PRENTISS Enter Maid . MAID You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here will you ? MAID Right away , Mr. Prentiss . Maid goes . EDITH PRENTISS What are you going to say ? LANGLEY PRENTISS ( weakening before the encounter ) Maybe you better do it , Edith . You 're better at these practical things than I am . You hired him . You should fire him . EDITH PRENTISS All right . LANGLEY PRENTISS You will ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( looks at her - hesitates - then ) Do you want this letter ? EDITH PRENTISS No . LANGLEY PRENTISS Take it . So you will have the facts ! EDITH PRENTISS ( pushing it away ) I do n't need it , Langley . I do n't want it . LANGLEY PRENTISS No , you never want facts ! p. 21 Sidney appears at the door . SIDNEY You want me , Mr. Prentiss . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( brushes past him , goes out the hall door ) EDITH PRENTISS Come in , Sidney . Sit down . I want to talk to you . SIDNEY ( standing ) I 'm listening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter about you - my brother has - from Mr. Neville , in London . He SIDNEY ( excitedly ) Whatever he says is not true ! He wants to revenge himself because I would not stay with him and I have my reasons for that , that I 'm not saying ! He lies - he  --  EDITH PRENTISS ( soothing ) Sidney , the letter does n't say anything of importance at all . I just want to check up on it with you . SIDNEY Yes , Miss Edith . EDITH PRENTISS Were you born in India ? ( as he hesitates ) I would find it very interesting if you were ! SIDNEY I was , if you wish it , Miss Edith . EDITH PRENTISS And are you part - ( hesitates ) native there ? p. 22 SIDNEY If you wish it , Miss Edith . EDITH PRENTISS You do not look it at all ! SIDNEY ( bitterly ) It is very little , but enough ! EDITH PRENTISS What do you mean by that  --  enough ? SIDNEY ( bitterly ) Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not here , Sidney - you wo n't be put aside here . SIDNEY Not if no one knows . EDITH PRENTISS It will just make you more interesting ! We do n't feel as the English do . Is that why you wanted to stay ? SIDNEY Yes . EDITH PRENTISS But why did n't you tell Mr. Neville that frankly ? Why did you run away ? SIDNEY I did n't run away , Miss Edith . I just did n't come to the boat . EDITH PRENTISS But he expected you - counted on you ! SIDNEY I had given him his tickets and luggage checks - I - EDITH PRENTISS What about your own ticket ? SIDNEY I had cancelled that . He did n't lose anything . p. 23 EDITH PRENTISS He lost you , Sidney . SIDNEY I had to do it this way - to avoid touble - for him . EDITH PRENTISS What trouble ? SIDNEY Please do n't ask me that . I never want to tell it . Not even to you . EDITH PRENTISS But you must tell me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It was Mrs. Neville . EDITH PRENTISS Yes ? SIDNEY I did n't esteem her , Miss Edith . It was necessary that I go away . If I had stayed , it would not have been right to Mr. Neville . I could not tell him that , Miss Edith . I just had to go . EDITH PRENTISS ( slowly ) You are good , Sidney . You are good  --  and you are strong . ( looking at him ) I felt that the first day you came here to ask for the position . At first , when I looked into your eyes I felt uneasy . They are so dark and deep ! Life does n't come out from them as in ours , but seems to sink in , go down , be lost . But then you touched me with your hands ! You have beautiful hands , Sidney , so light , but full of power . When you put them on me just to lift me , I feel such a strength come from you to me ! p. 24 SIDNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to give you my strength . I want to make you well . EDITH PRENTISS Oh Sidney ! That is beautiful of you ! But it can never be ! At first when I was ill , and the doctors used to come to me and take my hand , I used to feel the same thing ! He will make me well ! But it never happened ! I 'm doomed for my life ! This life ! There are no miracles , Sidney ! SIDNEY There is Love Love cures , Miss Edith . ( he falls on his knees beside her ) Do n't send me away , Miss Edith . I 'll make you well - my love will make you well ! EDITH PRENTISS You - you - love me , Sidney ? SIDNEY Yes ! Do n't send me away from you ! EDITH PRENTISS Sidney - you ca n't love me ! No man can love me ! SIDNEY Why not ? EDITH PRENTISS No man ever has . SIDNEY You are the most to-be-loved woman I have ever known ! EDITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crippled ! SIDNEY That 's nothing ! EDITH PRENTISS It does n't - repel you ? p. 25 SIDNEY No . It makes me love you more ! EDITH PRENTISS As a spirit , maybe , a suffering spirit ! Not as a woman ! SIDNEY Yes . As woman ! EDITH PRENTISS Oh - SIDNEY People here do n't understand love as we people do . EDITH PRENTISS You mean - as Eastern people do ? SIDNEY Yes ! Look at the women of China ! Their men make them cripple their feet to love them more ! EDITH PRENTISS More ! SIDNEY Here men do n't understand these things as we men do . EDITH PRENTISS All my life I have dreamed that I would be loved as a woman - but I - never thought I would ever know it ! SIDNEY You 'll know it now ! - tonight ! Let me hold you in my arms tonight ! EDITH PRENTISS Oh no ! SIDNEY Would it not make you happy ? EDITH PRENTISS Oh - SIDNEY Then why not ? EDITH PRENTISS ( crying out ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ! p. 26 SIDNEY We say in India : " A woman to be happy must have a man in her arms in the night , a child in her arms in the day " EDITH PRENTISS Oh , Sidney ! Do n't tell me these things ! SIDNEY Are they not true ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes , yes - they are true ! In the night and in the day ! But I can never know them - never ! I can never have a child , Sidney ! All my life I have longed for one ! Do you know what that means , to spend your life in longing - hopeless longing ? SIDNEY You already have the first - you are loved ! EDITH PRENTISS Loved ! A loved woman ! - Oh Sidney ! You have given me the most beautiful gift ! How can I ever repay you ? SIDNEY By never sending me away from you . EDITH PRENTISS How can one pay for a dream , a dream come true ! ( Suddenly ) It must be that you knew me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like this about me now SIDNEY Yes - in many lives . EDITH PRENTISS You think that ? SIDNEY I know it . It 's what we believe . p. 27 EDITH PRENTISS Oh Sidney , you must teach me all these things ! ( eagerly ) I have always believed it innerly . I have always felt that I must have done some great wrong in another life that I have to make up for now . Otherwise there is no justice in anything . ( smiling ) Maybe - I was cruel to you , Sidney ! SIDNEY Then you will make it up to me now . EDITH PRENTISS I 'll give you only good now . I 'll give you everything I have to give - a great and a pure love - and - SIDNEY And I will make you well . EDITH PRENTISS Oh Sidney ! How ? Will you teach me some secret of the East ? Will you teach me - the - SIDNEY I will teach you only one secret - love ! - for that is the secret of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh my love ! My love ! SIDNEY ( getting to his feet ) Hsh . EDITH PRENTISS What is it ? SIDNEY Someone is coming . LANGLEY comes on from the center door . LANGLEY PRENTISS Mr. Erdmann is here . I just saw his old Chevy drive up . p. 28 The outer bell rings . EDITH PRENTISS Bring him in , will you , Sidney ? SIDNEY Yes , Miss Prentiss . He goes out the hall door . LANGLEY PRENTISS Well ? Did you settle it ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS Is he leaving ? EDITH PRENTISS No . He is staying . LANGLEY PRENTISS For how long ? EDITH PRENTISS For a long as I do . Sidney appears at hall door with ERICH ERDMANN . Erdmann is a man in the forties - a European - a German - speaking English fluently with a very slight accent . EDITH PRENTISS Mr. Erdmann ! How nice that you could come ! ERICH ERDMANN ( crossing to her ) It 's always a pleasure for me , Miss Prentiss . EDITH PRENTISS You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRENTISS A great pleasure to see you again , sir . EDITH PRENTISS And Mr. John Sidney . p. 29 LANGLEY PRENTISS My secretary . EDITH PRENTISS Wo n't you sit down . ERICH ERDMANN By you - if I may . Maid on with tea service . She takes it to a small table beside Edity and stands beside her . EDITH PRENTISS ( to Maid ) That 's all , Clara . Mr. Sidney will help me . Maid goes . ( Sidney goes to stand beside Edith - to help her with tea things and takes a cup to Erdmann - and to Langley ) EDITH PRENTISS ( starting to pour ) You will have a cup of tea , Mr. Erdmann ? ERICH ERDMANN With pleasure . ( turning to Langley ) You sister has told me , Mr. Prentiss , that you are engaged in a very interesting work . LANGLEY PRENTISS Interesting and important , I think . ERICH ERDMANN A book , is it not ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes ! a book that may revolutionize society . ERICH ERDMANN ( smiles ) Karl Marx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Exactly . I am creating a plan for a new world society - a synthesis of Marx and our Western ideas . p. 30 ERICH ERDMANN What of Eastern ideas - if it is a plan for the world ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes , Langley ! The East has ideas , too ! Has n't it , Sidney ? SIDNEY Indeed , yes , Miss Prentiss . EDITH PRENTISS Transcendental - other-worldly ideas . LANGLEY PRENTISS I 'm not interested in superstitions , my dear sister . EDITH PRENTISS ( struck - turns to Erdmann ) Have you located anything for me , Mr. Erdmann ? ERICH ERDMANN I do n't know , Miss Prentiss . Your demands are not so easy to fill . EDITH PRENTISS ( laughs ) I only want perfection ! That 's why I come to you , Mr. Erdmann . ERICH ERDMANN You said a small desk ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes . Early American . ERICH ERDMANN ( taking out a photograph of a desk ) Do you like that ? ( hands it to her - she studies it ) LANGLEY PRENTISS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it happen that you a foreigner , should be so interested in purely American things ? p. 31 ERICH ERDMANN Everything in America interests me , Mr. Prentiss . LANGLEY PRENTISS You do n't find us vulgar , as most Europeans do ? ERICH ERDMANN I find you free , Mr. Prentiss - free ! LANGLEY PRENTISS And that is enough for you ? ERICH ERDMANN In the world today - yes - ( turning to Edith ) This is very fine tea , Miss Prentiss . You ca n't get this now . EDITH PRENTISS ( studying the photograph ) I know . ERICH ERDMANN It used to come through by the old caravan route . It was always very mare . EDITH PRENTISS I still have a small supply . ERICH ERDMANN This was Prince Lichenstein 's favorite tea . He used to send us a little every Christmas . This tea brings back a world to me , Miss Prentiss - a lost world . ( as she puts the photograph down ) Well ? EDITH PRENTISS I like it .

LANGLEY PRENTISS See who it is - will you , Sidney ? ( As sidney goes to the terrace door ) There have been a lot of prowlers around lately . EDITH PRENTISS Nonsense ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( gets up and follows Sidney - as Sidney opens the door ) Who 's there ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( off ) It 's just me , Uncle Langley ! EDITH PRENTISS ( crying out with pleasure ) Kate ! KATHARINE ASHTON comes on . She is a young girl , wearing a heavy , very good-looking sport coat , a beret , muffler , galoshes . When she takes these off , she is wearing a full-skirted woolen dress with a rather fitted top ; not an ordinary college-girl 's dress , something a little apart . She comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katie ! What are you doing here ? p. 33 KATHERINE ASHTON I just came . LANGLEY PRENTISS College is n't over , is it ? KATHERINE ASHTON No , I just came . LANGLEY PRENTISS What a nonsensical reply ! and what are you sneaking around the back way for ? Why did n't you come in the front door ? What are you doing here anyway ? EDITH PRENTISS Oh , do n't begin to scold the child the minute she gets here ! ( to Kate ) Take your things off , dear . You are just in time for tea and to meet Mr. Erdmann . This is Miss Katharine Ashton . KATHERINE ASHTON ( nods and begins to take off her coat ) LANGLEY PRENTISS ( crossing back to his chair ) My late wife 's daughter . ERICH ERDMANN ( looking at her with interest ) So you are a college girl ? KATHERINE ASHTON Yes . ERICH ERDMANN You look very young for college . KATHERINE ASHTON I 'm not young . I 'm 17 . ERICH ERDMANN ( smiles ) That 's young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smmester . LANGLEY PRENTISS What have you come home for ? Have you run away ? KATHERINE ASHTON No , Uncle Langley . I did n't run away . I just left . LANGLEY PRENTISS You just left ! Why ? KATHERINE ASHTON I do n't like it there . I do n't feel right . LANGLEY PRENTISS Do n't feel right ! There is a modern child for you ! ( to Edith ) This is your fault ! EDITH PRENTISS Of course ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Well ! Who insisted that she go to a progressive school - who  --  EDITH PRENTISS I did and she liked it ! Didn'you , Kate ? KATHERINE ASHTON Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS Then when it comes time for college , she does n't like it ! - so she quits ! EDITH PRENTISS She had a good reason and she will tell us later . Do n't you want some tea now , dear ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( going to her ) Yes , thank you . EDITH PRENTISS What a charming dress you have ! New , is n't it ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ERICH ERDMANN You made it ! I did n't know American girls made anything  --  ( smiles ) except trouble - delightful trouble . EDITH PRENTISS This child can make anything ! She has deft hands and perfect taste ! ERICH ERDMANN You do n't mean all that ! EDITH PRENTISS Yes , perfect taste . Born with it . Like pure pitch . ERICH ERDMANN ( to Kate ) I wish I had you ! You do n't want to come to work for me , do you ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( shyly ) Thank you . But I guess I 'm not going to work . ( she is beside the tea table - tea cup in hand ) ERICH ERDMANN Going to marry ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( shyly ) Yes . ERICH ERDMANN Have children ? KATHERINE ASHTON Yes . ERICH ERDMANN Bravo ! I like to hear a beautiful girl say that . KATHERINE ASHTON I 'm not beautiful , Mr. Erdmann. p. 36 ERICH ERDMANN You will be . You 'll look just like your mother . KATHERINE ASHTON ( eagerly ) Did you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( looking up quickly ) I did n't know you had ever met my wife ? ( irritably ) Did you bring that about , Edith ? EDITH PRENTISS No . LANGLEY PRENTISS Then how did it happen ? ERICH ERDMANN It happened because your wife came to see me . LANGLEY PRENTISS Came to see you ? For what ? ERICH ERDMANN To sell some pearls . LANGLEY PRENTISS But that 's impossible ! Do you hear that , Edith ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS This is incredible ! Did you buy them ? ERICH ERDMANN No . LANGLEY PRENTISS Why not ? If she offered them ? They were a very valuable string . ERICH ERDMANN ( quietly ) Pearls are not in my line . p. 37 LANGLEY PRENTISS You gave them back to her ? ERICH ERDMANN Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS When was all this ? ERICH ERDMANN The afternoon of the day she died , as I heard later . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( more and more excited ) You hear this , Edith ? ( to Erdmann ) Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( quietly ) I thought you knew . And if you did n't - it was her affair - not mine . LANGLEY PRENTISS This is phantastic ! My wife 's pearls disappeared after her death . We never found a trace of them . Did she tell you anything that day , what she might be going to do with them - or - ERICH ERDMANN ( quietly ) She said , she was going to throw them in the river . LANGLEY PRENTISS Throw them in the river ! A valuable string like that ! Why would she want to do a thing like that ? ( suddenly - bitterly - half to himself ) To keep me from getting them , I suppose ! KATHERINE ASHTON ( crying out ) That 's not true ! No ! Mama was not like that ! p. 38 LANGLEY PRENTISS You do n't know anything about what your mother was like , you were too young . KATHERINE ASHTON ( increasing passion ) I know everything about my mother ! I know how lovely she was , and sweet and generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the money to you and now you dare to say  --  EDITH PRENTISS Kate ! KATHERINE ASHTON It 's so unjust ! I ca n't bear it when people are unjust ! LANGLEY PRENTISS What made you say , your mother wanted to sell the pearls for me ? KATHERINE ASHTON She told me so . She asked me if she could . LANGLEY PRENTISS She asked you ? KATHERINE ASHTON Yes , Mama always asked me everything . LANGLEY PRENTISS When you were twelve years old ? KATHERINE ASHTON Always . She asked me if I minded because she always said they were for me to protect me in life . ( her lips tremble ) LANGLEY PRENTISS Did she tell you why she wanted to sell them ? KATHERINE ASHTON Yes . She said you were unhappy about her for something and had lost money in the market and she thought if she gave you some , you would feel happier about everything . Mama could n't stand people to be unhappy . She just loved happiness . ( she begins to weep wildly ) p. 39 EDITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your room and rest . KATHERINE ASHTON ( trying to control her tears ) I 'll be all right . LANGLEY PRENTISS I think I see the solution of our mystery , Edith . She probably offered them to some other dealer that day and when he heard of her death , he simply kept them . EDITH PRENTISS Oh Langley ! ( she looks at the weeping girl ) Let us go into the other room now , shall we ? ( to Erdmann ) I have a new bit of Moissen , Mr. Erdmann . I 'd like you to look at it , will you ? ERICH ERDMANN Yes , on my way out . EDITH PRENTISS ( starts to wheel her little chair away from the tea table ) ( as Sidney goes to help - Erdmann takeshold of the back of the chair ) ERICH ERDMANN I 'd like the honor of doing this , if I may . EDITH PRENTISS Thank you , Mr. Erdmann . ERICH ERDMANN ( wheeling Edith off - turns back ) Good-bye , Katharine . KATHERINE ASHTON Good-bye . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work ! - hard ! KATHERINE ASHTON Thank you . EDITH PRENTISS ( turning ) Go to your room now , Kate . You look very tired . KATHERINE ASHTON I 'm not tired . EDITH PRENTISS ( going off with Erdmann ) Coming Langley ? LANGLEY PRENTISS ( following them ) Coming . EDITH PRENTISS Coming , Sidney ? SIDNEY Yes , Miss Prentiss . Edith , Langley , Erdmann go . ( Sidney gives Kate a swift , uneasy glance and starts after them ) KATHERINE ASHTON Sidney ! SIDNEY ( turns - she starts toward him eagerly ) Hssh ! Look out ! KATHERINE ASHTON What 's the matter ? SIDNEY Someone might come . KATHERINE ASHTON Not now . They have just gone . SIDNEY They might come back . Wait till tonight . p. 41 KATHERINE ASHTON ( beginning to be a little frightened ) Are n't you glad I have come ? SIDNEY Of course ! For me - yes . For you - No . You must go right back , little baby . KATHERINE ASHTON I 'm never going back . SIDNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to stay with you . SIDNEY You ca n't do that ! KATHERINE ASHTON Why not ? SIDNEY You 've got to finish school ! KATHERINE ASHTON I ca n't now . SIDNEY Why not ? KATHERINE ASHTON I ca n't learn ! I ca n't listen ! My mind goes away to you , Sidney . That 's where my mind is all the time . SIDNEY ( soothing ) I know , little baby . You come back now and then if you want , like you did now . But the next day you go back to school . You have got to get an education ! KATHERINE ASHTON ( as she shakes her head ) No - SIDNEY Yes ! Otherwise you ca n't get the things you want in life - or - p. 42 KATHERINE ASHTON I do n't want anything in life - only to be with you ! Or life 's just a torment to me . I want to marry you , Sidney . That 's why I 've come . SIDNEY We ca n't marry ! KATHERINE ASHTON Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? KATHERINE ASHTON They are not my people ! I have n't any people ! I 'm not even adopted . I do n't belong to anybody ! SIDNEY Mr. Prentiss is your guardian , is n't he ? KATHERINE ASHTON No , he is n't ! I just stay here in vacations ! Aunt Edith sends me to school and - that 's all . SIDNEY You must never let her know about us - or she will throw you out ! KATHERINE ASHTON Aunt Edith will never throw me out for anything . SIDNEY She will throw me out then ! - and how ! You must never tell her - promise me - for your own sake ! She will put you out of her will - she 'll  --  KATHERINE ASHTON How do you know I 'm in her will ? SIDNEY Are n't you ? KATHERINE ASHTON I do n't know . I never thought of it . p. 43 SIDNEY You must be . Everybody is . KATHERINE ASHTON Why wo n't you marry me , Sidney ? SIDNEY You are not old enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIDNEY It would n't be legal . KATHERINE ASHTON You do n't want to marry me ? SIDNEY Of course I do , Baby . I 'm only thinking of you . KATHERINE ASHTON What ? SIDNEY What would we live on ? KATHERINE ASHTON On what you earn . SIDNEY But they would throw me out , I tell you ! KATHERINE ASHTON You could get another job . SIDNEY That 's not so easy . I have no connections here . To work for rich people you have to have good connections . KATHERINE ASHTON You do n't have to work for rich people . SIDNEY I do n't work for anybody else . KATHERINE ASHTON What not ? SIDNEY There is a saying we have  --  p. 44 KATHERINE ASHTON ( interrupting ) Who 's " we ? " SIDNEY ( ignoring ) " The crumbs from a rich man 's table are very nourishing ! " ( suddenly ) I 'm not going to be satisfied with crumbs all my life ! I 'm going to get a slice of the cake before I die ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIDNEY I have to be serious sometime ! ( brusquely ) I 've gone down another road already . KATHERINE ASHTON What do you mean by this ? SIDNEY ( shrugs , does n't answer ) KATHERINE ASHTON You mean - you have someone else - so you do n't want me anymore ? SIDNEY I 'm not saying that . KATHERINE ASHTON ( frightened ) What 's going to become of me - without you ? SIDNEY ( soothing ) You 'll be all right . I took good care of you . I made you a woman . You can play your own hand now . You do n't need me . Edith comes on from the hall . EDITH PRENTISS ( to Kate ) Oh , darling . You are still here ? I thought you were going to your room ? p. 45 KATHERINE ASHTON ( going to door ) I will now . EDITH PRENTISS You have just time for a little rest before dinner . I always take one , you know . SIDNEY Shall I take you to your room now , Miss Prentiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as he starts off ) Come back when he is through with you . SIDNEY ( nods - goes ) KATHERINE ASHTON ( in the doorway - starts out - turns back ) Aunt Edith ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes , dear ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( desperately ) Why did my mother kill herself ? EDITH PRENTISS ( surprised ) You know that ? KATHERINE ASHTON Of course ! EDITH PRENTISS We told you it was an accident . KATHERINE ASHTON I always knew it was n't , but I never knew why . Had something awful happened to her just then ? EDITH PRENTISS You knew and never said anything ! p. 46 KATHERINE ASHTON I never say anything , Aunt Edith . Mama always told me not to . " Never say anything , " she said . " Just be silent . " But sometimes something breaks in me - like today - when Uncle Langley said that , and I ca n't stand it anymore . - I just cry out ! Do you know why she did it , Aunt Edith ? EDITH PRENTISS No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . She seemed perfectly happy , but she must not have been . KATHERINE ASHTON Mama never showed it if she was unhappy . Something awful must have happened . EDITH PRENTISS I always thought that it was just that she could n't stand it here with us anymore and had no other place to go . KATHERINE ASHTON No - she loved the house and the garden and the river . She said it was like her home when she was a little girl - She wanted to keep it for me - like her pearls ! ( pause - then ) Do you think she maybe could just have lost them that day - and that made her - EDITH PRENTISS ( quickly ) No , no , dear . She did n't lose them ! Anyway . She did n't care enough about things - to - KATHERINE ASHTON She cared about that ! She wanted to keep it for me - to protect me in life . ( she begins to cry ) p. 47 EDITH PRENTISS Do n't dear , please ! KATHERINE ASHTON Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them terribly . EDITH PRENTISS You need them ? What for ? KATHERINE ASHTON I need money , Aunt Edith ! I need money terribly . EDITH PRENTISS What for , dear ? KATHERINE ASHTON I 'm going to have a baby , Aunt Edith . EDITH PRENTISS You are not ! KATHERINE ASHTON ( nods ) Yes . EDITH PRENTISS But girls do n't have babies like this anymore ! KATHERINE ASHTON ( nods ) Yes . EDITH PRENTISS How did it happen , dear ? KATHERINE ASHTON Just like it always happens . EDITH PRENTISS Somebody you met in college ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( shakes her head ) No . EDITH PRENTISS Who , dear ? KATHERINE ASHTON I 'm not going to tell , Aunt Edith ! I do n't want anyone to know . p. 48 EDITH PRENTISS You have to tell , dear . You 've got to marry him now . You 've  --  KATHERINE ASHTON No ! EDITH PRENTISS But you must ! KATHERINE ASHTON ( shakes her head ) I ca n't . EDITH PRENTISS Why not ? KATHERINE ASHTON He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( quickly - crying out ) No - no - I 'll never tell him ! I never want him to know ! not ever ! EDITH PRENTISS Why not , dear ? KATHERINE ASHTON Not if he does n't want me ! I 'm not going to be married out of pity ! ( weak ) There would n't even be that ! EDITH PRENTISS Did you love him very much ? KATHERINE ASHTON No ! EDITH PRENTISS Then - how did it happen ? KATHERINE ASHTON Oh - do n't keep asking me , Aunt Edith ! I thought it was love - but now I know it was n't . It was n't anything . p. 49 EDITH PRENTISS ( thoughtfully ) Has it been very long ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( nods ) Yes . EDITH PRENTISS But have only been gone a few months . KATHERINE ASHTON It happened before  --  EDITH PRENTISS When you were in the other school ? KATHERINE ASHTON Oh , do n't ask me , Aunt Edith , please ! EDITH PRENTISS Heavens ! We must never let Langley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I suppose they taught you sex and all that ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( nods ) Some . EDITH PRENTISS What ? KATHERINE ASHTON Oh - just that it 's part of life - nothing to be ashamed of . ( suddenly crying out ) But I have been ashamed ! I ca n't bear it that anyone should know ! I can tell myself everything they said - but still I 'm ashamed ! I made myself this new dress to hide it and I 'm all laced in so tight , I can hardly breathe ! EDITH PRENTISS You must n't do that , dear . You might injure it. It 's a life , darling - given you ! ( a look almost of ecstacy begins in her face ) p. 50 KATHERINE ASHTON ( almost in a frenzy ) But I do n't want it ! Not now ! Not his ! I want to get rid of it ! Out of me !  --  I  --  EDITH PRENTISS Hush ! Do n't talk like that ! KATHERINE ASHTON ( with a despairing cry ) Oh , Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRENTISS ( slowly , her strange look of ecstacy growing ) You are going to have it ! KATHERINE ASHTON No ! EDITH PRENTISS Yes ! For me . KATHERINE ASHTON ( bewildered ) For you - Aunt Edith ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes ! It will be mine ! KATHERINE ASHTON You mean - you 'll take it ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes ! Mine ! KATHERINE ASHTON Oh , Aunt Edith , you are so good . ( tears of relief - then ) Will I just stay here to have it ? Uncle Langley will  --  EDITH PRENTISS No - we wo n't stay here . KATHERINE ASHTON Where will we go ? p. 51 EDITH PRENTISS To Doctor Jean . KATHERINE ASHTON ( relieved ) Yes ! She 'll help us ! She 'll do everything ! ( suddenly snxious again ) Do you think she 'll let us come ? EDITH PRENTISS I know she will . ( suddenly cries out ) Oh , Kate ! It 's like a miracle ! Everything comes together - and makes a pattern ! - aflower ! - like those lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ! - and then - suddenly - the most wonderful flower comes to them ! And  --  Sidney on . SIDNEY Excuse me , Miss Edith - it 's time for your rest before dinner . KATHERINE ASHTON ( looks at him - then suddenly runs to outer door ) EDITH PRENTISS Kate ! Where are you going ? KATHERINE ASHTON Out ! She goes . EDITH PRENTISS Take your coat ! Sidney ! Go after her - take her - coat . SIDNEY ( smiling ) It 's not cold . She 's young and strong . EDITH PRENTISS ( almost jealous ) Yes ! ( suddenly holding out her arms ) Oh Sidney ! What you told me ! To hold in your arms ! In the night and in the day ! It 's all coming to me ! p. 52 SIDNEY Yes . EDITH PRENTISS Two miracles ! Kate on at outer door . EDITH PRENTISS Kate - you back ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( crossing ) I came to get my coat . SIDNEY Shall I wheel you to your room , Miss Edith ? EDITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his arms - carries her into her room ) KATHERINE ASHTON ( alone - crosses to the fire - holds out her hands ) @x ( calling out joyfully as they come in ) Hello everybody !

EDITH PRENTISS ( calling ) Come down , dear ! We are home ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( off ) Righto ! KATHERINE ASHTON ( starts toward the outer door ) I 'll get the others in . Put them in their room right away . EDITH PRENTISS ( quickly ) What is their room ? p. 54 KATHERINE ASHTON Why ! The nurse 's room , next to yours , is n't it ? EDITH PRENTISS ( bruskly ) No ! It is not ! KATHERINE ASHTON I thought you wanted the baby close to you . EDITH PRENTISS I do . But not there . KATHERINE ASHTON But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? EDITH PRENTISS No . She is not . KATHERINE ASHTON That 's what I arranged with her when I hired her - that as soon as we got home she  --  EDITH PRENTISS ( petulantly ) Will you let me arrange my own life , please , Katie ? KATHERINE ASHTON Of course . EDITH PRENTISS You have just taken me over ! - all of me ! You handle me as though I were a child ! KATHERINE ASHTON Where do you want them then - upstairs ? EDITH PRENTISS No . Downstairs ! In the guest room . KATHERINE ASHTON ( surprised ) In that room ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes ! Why not ? p. 55 KATHERINE ASHTON No one 's ever used that room since  --  EDITH PRENTISS Well - we are going to use it now ! ( triumphantly ) There is new life beginning in this house ! Langley on from hall . LANGLEY PRENTISS Well ! KATHERINE ASHTON ( going out ) Hello , Uncle Langley ! Kate off . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( to Edith ) So you are back .

LANGLEY PRENTISS What did you want with two taxis ? EDITH PRENTISS ( gay ) Oh , I have a lot of new possessions ! LANGLEY PRENTISS How you waste money ! Why did n't you let me know you were coming ? EDITH PRENTISS ( gaily ) I wanted to give you a surprise . p. 56 LANGLEY PRENTISS Hm ! The trouble with giving a surprise is one usually gets one . EDITH PRENTISS ( teasing ) Are you going to surprise me ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Not that I know of ! EDITH PRENTISS Well - I 'm going to surprise you ! LANGLEY PRENTISS That 's possible . I do n't know what you have been up to . You did n't let me hear from you very often down there . EDITH PRENTISS Oh , Langley ! I was too busy to write , I  --  LANGLEY PRENTISS You seem to write to Sidney pretty regularly ! EDITH PRENTISS There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the house . Did my new desk come ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes . Soon after you left . EDITH PRENTISS Is it nice ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Very . Erdmann has been ringing up to ask when you would be back . I suppose he has something else to load you up with . EDITH PRENTISS Oh , Langley ! How you interpret everything ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( a little awkwardly ) You are looking very well . I do n't think I ever saw you looking as well ! p. 57 EDITH PRENTISS I am well . Oh , Langley ! Something wonderful happened to me down there ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( unimpressed ) Yes ? What happened to the roosters you took down ? Did Jean distribute them among her proteges ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS And did the stock improve ? EDITH PRENTISS No ! They all ate them for dinner the first Sunday . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( disgusted ) Ha ! EDITH PRENTISS They are wonderful people , Langley ! Simply wonderful ! Kate comes on . She carries a travelling bag . EDITH PRENTISS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should n't . KATHERINE ASHTON Why not , Aunt Edith ? I 'm strong . EDITH PRENTISS Yes . But you should n't !

EDITH PRENTISS A siesta ? p. 58 LANGLEY PRENTISS You learned what a siesta is down there , did n't you ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes ! Go out and get him , Katie . Kate starts off out the hall door again . EDITH PRENTISS Where are you going ? KATHERINE ASHTON To get the rest of the luggage . EDITH PRENTISS I said to get Sidney ! KATHERINE ASHTON But Uncle Langley said he is asleep ! EDITH PRENTISS What difference does that make ? Get him up ! Go out to the garage and call up to him . ( as Kate still does not move ) What 's the matter with you ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( crossing to the terrace door ) Nothing , Aunt Edith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LANGLEY PRENTISS All right . EDITH PRENTISS Your work going well ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Very well ! ( impressively ) I have about finished , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS Finished ? p. 59 LANGLEY PRENTISS That surprises you , does n't it ? EDITH PRENTISS Why - I thought it would keep you busy your whole life ! Sidney must have been a help to you ! LANGLEY PRENTISS A good secretary is always a help . EDITH PRENTISS Then you like him again ? LANGLEY PRENTISS No , I do not . I sacrifice my own aversion - and distrust - to the importance of my work . MRS . MEEKER on at the hall door . She is a nice , efficient characterful English woman of middle age , wearing a nurse 's uniform . MRS . MEEKER Excuse me , Miss Prentiss , I need that bag .

LANGLEY PRENTISS ( he thrusts the paper back to her again ) What rot ! EDITH PRENTISS Do n't you believe it ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Of course not ! EDITH PRENTISS But Langley , you must believe it ! ( laughs ) It 's written on a little paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Langley . p. 62 LANGLEY PRENTISS Have you gone out of your senses ? EDITH PRENTISS You mean my mind is out of order ! ( waving the paper delightedly ) But this is all in order , Langley ! Only the little papers have to be in order . We live in the age of the little papers . Nothing else matters - only the little papers ! LANGLEY PRENTISS How much did you pay for that little paper ? EDITH PRENTISS Not much . Cheap for all it 's given me. ( with her strange , sweet smile ) I have a child , Langley ! to pray for me me at the tomb of my ancestors when I am dead . I would n't get into Heaven without that prayer . And I want to know Heaven ! Just once - just a glimpse - a little fleeting glimpse . You would n't deny me that , Langley ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( kindly ) Edith , if you adopted a child down there , it maybe a very good thing for you . I 'm the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't oppose it , Langley . What good would it do you ? It 's down on a little paper forever and ever . LANGLEY PRENTISS Edith ! Drop this nonsense ! Even the best jokes  --  EDITH PRENTISS It is n't a joke , Langley . It 's real . Wait till you see her .

KATHERINE ASHTON I 'm not upset ! EDITH PRENTISS Yes , you are ! ( she turns her little chair toward her bedroom door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me help you , Aunt Edith . p. 64 EDITH PRENTISS I do n't need help ! KATHERINE ASHTON Let me undress you so that you can rest . You must be exhausted . EDITH PRENTISS ( wheeling off ) No , I 'm not exhausted ! and I 'm not going to rest ! I 'm just going to put on some lipstick ! Open the door , please . Kate opens Edith 's door . Edith goes off . Kate starts toward the luggage that she brought in . LANGLEY PRENTISS That child your aunt has brought home with her - whose is it , Katherine ? KATHERINE ASHTON It 's hers . LANGLEY PRENTISS I mean , who is it 's real mother ? KATHERINE ASHTON She says she is . LANGLEY PRENTISS That 's just crazy ! KATHERINE ASHTON No ! LANGLEY PRENTISS It 's a delusion ! KATHERINE ASHTON No ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( impatient ) Well , illusion then . KATHERINE ASHTON But if it stranghens her , Uncle Langley ! and gives her happiness ? p. 65 LANGLEY PRENTISS You wo n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the truth for her . LANGLEY PRENTISS It 's a lie ! ( as Kate turns away to the luggage again ) If you wo n't tell me anything I 'm going to write to Jean . KATHERINE ASHTON She wo n't tell you . LANGLEY PRENTISS Was n't she the doctor ? KATHERINE ASHTON Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS Then she knows who the mother is . KATHERINE ASHTON But she wo n't tell you . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( starting out the hall door ) Women are all lawless - without exception - completely lawless ! ( turns in the doorway , quickly ) It is n't yours by any chance ? KATHERINE ASHTON ( a little frightened ) Why do you ask that , Uncle Langley ? Sidney appears in the terrace door . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( quickly ) I 'm sorry !

KATHERINE ASHTON ( does n't answer - starts off with luggage ) SIDNEY ( getting in front of her ) So you 're beginning that line again - the same line you took before you went away - the silent treatment - refusal to talk to me - treating me as though I did n't exist . KATHERINE ASHTON You do n't - for me . SIDNEY No ? You ca n't get away from me - ever . I 'm in here . ( rubs his finger on her arm as though along the vein ) A woman can never get free from the first man who gives her love - do n't you know that ? He haunts her heart - beats there - forever .

I think she intended it that way because she came downstairs that night to sleep alone here in the guest room - where I could reach her . KATHERINE ASHTON Did she say that ? EDITH PRENTISS Of course not . She said she has n't been able to sleep upstairs - the nights had been hot . But I know she wanted to be where I could come to her in the morning .

ERICH ERDMANN I never actually saw it . I had it sent directly here . EDITH PRENTISS How did you find out ? ERICH ERDMANN Oh , he tried it again - and that came directly to me. the fellow 's a genius - to give a crook his due . I never saw a more beautiful copy .

He 's never here in the afternoons as far as I know . Where does he go anyway ? EDITH PRENTISS He goes for something for me , Langley . LANGLEY PRENTISS Always these trivial errands EDITH PRENTISS ( interrupting ) Oh Langley - please do n't begin to scold I came out specially to be with you . p. 99 LANGLEY PRENTISS You came out specially to be by the fire . EDITH PRENTISS Oh , Langley ! LANGLEY PRENTISS I 'm not blaming you . The whole house is cold . Why do n't you let the furnace go on ? EDITH PRENTISS ( softly ) When the furnace goes on , winter ca n't be far away . I love these crisp days , Langley - with just the fires . LANGLEY PRENTISS Then why do n't you put a chimney in that room of yours ? EDITH PRENTISS You want me to stay in there , do n't you , Langley ? Mrs. Meeker on with tea on a tray . MRS . MEEKER Good afternoon , Sir . ( puts tea beside Edith ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you like one , too ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Tea ? I 've just had lunch ! EDITH PRENTISS How did it go today , Langley ? LANGLEY PRENTISS It did n't go ! No one sees what I 've accomplished , Edith ! No one ! My ideas are too advanced . I 'm ahead of my time . The world must catch up with me ! ( impressive ) Posterity will recognize me , Edith ! p. 100 Mrs. Meeker crosses to hall door . EDITH PRENTISS ( suddenly - as Mrs. Meeker starts out the door ) Bring me my baby , Mrs. Meeker . MRS . MEEKER Now ? EDITH PRENTISS Yes . I want to hold her here by the fire . MRS . MEEKER She is still asleep , Madam . EDITH PRENTISS You always make some excuse when I want her . Why ? Are you jealous ? MRS . MEEKER Madam ! How can you say such a thing ! EDITH PRENTISS Many people are jealous , Mrs. Meeker . I know I am . MRS . MEEKER I only think she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - bring her anyway - as soon as she awakes . Mrs. Meeker goes . LANGLEY PRENTISS Edith , if you 're going to sit here with that little brat in your arms - you are not welcome ! EDITH PRENTISS Oh , Langley ! LANGLEY PRENTISS I 'm sorry - but if you want to carry on these orgies of motherhood - you 'd better go back to your own sitting room ! That 's what you made it for . p. 101 EDITH PRENTISS Langley ! Please ! LANGLEY PRENTISS I 'm sorry - but I just ca n't see it ! It affronts me . EDITH PRENTISS Why ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Why ? A little cast-off ! - EDITH PRENTISS She 's a lovely child , Langley . LANGLEY PRENTISS Ha ! EDITH PRENTISS You 've never really seen her ! You never look at her ! LANGLEY PRENTISS No . EDITH PRENTISS Why not ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Because I have a complete aversion to it . EDITH PRENTISS Why ca n't you love her as I do - you 're childless , too . LANGLEY PRENTISS Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a child , Langley ? LANGLEY PRENTISS No ! There are too many nasty people in the world as it is . EDITH PRENTISS A baby is not nasty ! LANGLEY PRENTISS I 'd like to know something nastier . EDITH PRENTISS Oh Langley ! p. 102 LANGLEY PRENTISS It is n't only the child that 's offensive to me - the whole thing is offensive . EDITH PRENTISS What whole thing ? LANGLEY PRENTISS This family life you 've set up for yourself - this intimacy with your secretary ! It 's degrading . EDITH PRENTISS ( bitterly ) He 's a first-class secretary - you 'll grant me that ! LANGLEY PRENTISS An excellent secretary . But getting less so every day . EDITH PRENTISS How can you say that ? He does everything for me - sees that the house is beautifully run - and - LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes , Edith , it 's a beautifully run house . You 've always created that . But it 's no longer a home - at least - not for me . EDITH PRENTISS Oh , Langley ! LANGLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your family - your pseudo family . EDITH PRENTISS It 's kept out of your sight . LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes , and I want it to continue that way . You in your rooms - me in mine - we 've arrived a a modus vivendi that is at least tolerable  --  or intelerable - to us both . p. 103 EDITH PRENTISS ( gently ) Can you bear with it a little longer , Langley ? LANGLEY PRENTISS How long ? EDITH PRENTISS Until I can walk ! Then I 'll walk out - LANGLEY PRENTISS Oh Edith - why do you persist in going on like this ? You know you will never walk ! EDITH PRENTISS I will ! I must ! ( speaking very firmly ) I am being cured , Langley . LANGLEY PRENTISS And what 's curing you - may I ask ? EDITH PRENTISS ( low - firm ) Prayer . LANGLEY PRENTISS Who 's prayer ? You 're not a religious woman . EDITH PRENTISS Sidney 's . LANGLEY PRENTISS I expected that answer . But it 's incredible . EDITH PRENTISS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoons that you so resent - to pray for me ! - that I may walk again ! Yes ! And it will happen ! ( as he makes a gesture ) I 've had two miracles ! Why should n't I have a third ? LANGLEY PRENTISS What miracles ? p. 104 EDITH PRENTISS ( to herself ) This one is not coming suddenly - like the others . I know that now - there is something keeps it back . LANGLEY PRENTISS What - may I ask ? EDITH PRENTISS My heart is n't pure . LANGLEY PRENTISS What rot . EDITH PRENTISS You do n't believe in miracles , do you , Langley ? LANGLEY PRENTISS I certainly do not ! EDITH PRENTISS And yet they happen . ( as he makes a gesture ) Look at Lourdes ! Hundreds of people have been cured there ! of all kinds of incurable things ! Hundreds have - LANGLEY PRENTISS And thousand have n't . EDITH PRENTISS Because their hearts were n't pure , Langley ! Mircales only come to the pure in heart.Sidney comes on at hall door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Sidney is laden with packages , flowers in a box etc . SIDNEY ( surprised ) You out here , Miss Edith ? EDITH PRENTISS For a little while . ( Sidney begins to undo his packages ) p. 105 LANGLEY PRENTISS I 'll go to my room till tea-time . He goes off . ( Note : The following scene must be played with the greatest tenderness , intimacy and sincerety from Sidney as well as from Edith . ) SIDNEY What brought you out here , dearest ? EDITH PRENTISS I was a little lonely , I guess . You were gone a long time , Sidney . It was very long . SIDNEY ( tenderly ) I know . The Temple is way down town - you know that - and then I had to way uptown again to get those records you wanted - and the books - ( brings books to her ) EDITH PRENTISS No more books . SIDNEY Do n't you want to even look at them ? EDITH PRENTISS ( shakes her head ) They do n't know anything that matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands are like ice ! EDITH PRENTISS Just a little nervousness . SIDNEY Why ? EDITH PRENTISS Oh everything is crowding in on me today ! SIDNEY What ? p. 106 EDITH PRENTISS ( smiles ) Reality . SIDNEY You 're all upset ! EDITH PRENTISS ( nods ) Yes ! Full of fear . SIDNEY What of ? EDITH PRENTISS I do n't know - just fear ! It 's been haunting me all day . SIDNEY Let 's play the new records - shall we ? EDITH PRENTISS ( nods ) SIDNEY ( turns to put on a record ) EDITH PRENTISS Sidney - I want you to take the baby away . SIDNEY Away ? EDITH PRENTISS For a drive - at tea time - will you ? SIDNEY Of course ! And you , too ! EDITH PRENTISS No - take Mrs. Meeker . I must be here . ( The music starts . ) Oh - how lovely ! That warms me . Oh Sidney - that is how I thought our life would be - great music ! - divine harmonies - only heard by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! p. 107 EDITH PRENTISS Oh Sidney ! No one ever gave me such tenderness and happiness ! Your love for me is truly a miracle ! You never leave my side - only to pray for me ! SIDNEY Did you feel better this afternoon , darling ? EDITH PRENTISS ( shakes her head - no ) SIDNEY You did n't ? EDITH PRENTISS ( shakes her head - No - in the same way ) SIDNEY Oh darling - I was sure that you did ! I could feel my soul join with yours - and I poured out to you all the strength I had . You did n't feel it ? EDITH PRENTISS Not today ! Not for many days ! SIDNEY You used to ! Everytime I came back you told me . EDITH PRENTISS Not anymore ! Warmth and love just ca n't reach me anymore . I 'm frozen in a barrier of ice ! It 's crushing me ! Oh Sidney - it 's not going to happen ! Never ! I 'm not getting any better ! I 'm getting worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This miracle wo n't be . SIDNEY Yes ! Yes , it will ! Love works miracles ! You know that . p. 108 EDITH PRENTISS Not my love . ( crying out ) Love is destroying me ! I 'm eaten up inside ! My love consumers me ! Devours me ! Mrs. Meeker on . MRS . MEEKER Mr. Hathaway is here , Madam . EDITH PRENTISS ( surprised ) Mr. Hathaway ? MRS . MEEKER Yes , Madam . EDITH PRENTISS To see me ? MRS . MEEKER No - to see Mr. Prentiss . I thought he was in here . EDITH PRENTISS Mr. Prentiss is upstairs in his room . MRS . MEEKER Thank you , Madam . She goes . EDITH PRENTISS ( troubled ) That 's strange . SIDNEY What ? EDITH PRENTISS Mr. Hathaway coming out here to see Langley . I wonder if he expected him and did n't tell me ? ( excitedly ) Yes ! Yes he did ! That 's why he came back so early from town ! - and was so irked to find me here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do n't want me to know ! SIDNEY ( soothing ) No ! What ? p. 109 EDITH PRENTISS Anything ! Everything ! Langley 's very much against me lately . SIDNEY ( soothing ) But he would n't do anything to hurt you . EDITH PRENTISS Yes ! Yes ! He often hurts me . SIDNEY But Hathway would n't do anything against you for worlds ! You 're too valuable to him . EDITH PRENTISS I know ! But now ! No , I do n't think he would do that ! SIDNEY WouldWhat darling ? EDITH PRENTISS No ! No ! He would n't ! Surely ! It would n't be ethical ! It - ( suddenly wheels to the boodshelves where her little safe is - she pulls the books out - moves the panel - takes out the box - opens it with her bracelet key - takes out a legal paper - hands it to Sidney ) SIDNEY SWhat is this ? EDITH PRENTISS A little paper ! - one of their little papers - the one they call a will . SIDNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw it up for me just last week . SIDNEY When I drove you down there ? p. 110 EDITH PRENTISS And carried me up - yes . SIDNEY I thought it must be important when you asked to be left alone there . EDITH PRENTISS I did n't want you to know what it says yet - But now I do ! This little paper - if I should die , Sidney - SIDNEY Do n't say that ! EDITH PRENTISS ( ignoring ) This little paper makes you the guardian of our child - and leaves everything I have to youboth - to my dear child and to my dear husband . SIDNEY Do you say that ? EDITH PRENTISS No ! Nothing beautiful can be put down in a little paper ! It would make it illegal ! It just says " to my devoted friend . " ( looks at him ) Even those lovely words are almost too much for a paper . ( dismissing it ) Well - now you know what it says - and where it is - so if anything should happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put paper back ) It 's here ! In its little vault ! SIDNEY Had n't I better keep it ? EDITH PRENTISS No - it 's safer here . SIDNEY But if Langley sees it . p. 111 EDITH PRENTISS He wo n't ! He does n't know this little box exists . Langley and Mr. Hathaway on . Mr. Hathaway is an old established lawyer - about sixty-five years old . LANGLEY PRENTISS Edith . EDITH PRENTISS ( turning ) Yes ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Mr. Hathaway is here . EDITH PRENTISS How do you do , Mr. Hathaway . MR . HATHAWAY How do you do , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS I 'm well - very well - and you ? MR . HATHAWAY Not so well , Edith - troubled . EDITH PRENTISS ( smiles ) Did you come to Langley for cheer ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Mr. Hathaway has something to talk to you about , Edith , alone - EDITH PRENTISS Me ? I thought he came to see you . MR . HATHAWAY I came about you , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS You did n't ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withLangley first . EDITH PRENTISS Ah - ( pause - then ) I 'm sorry you did n't ask for me right away , Mr. Hathway because now I 'm just going for a little drive . p. 112 MR . HATHAWAY It wo n't take long , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS I 'm sorry but I ca n't wait , Mr. Hathaway . It 's getting dark already ! And I want to see the color . ( to Sidney ) Bring the car around , Sidney , while I get my coat . SIDNEY Yes , Miss Edith . He goes . EDITH PRENTISS ( wheels to her door ) MR . HATHAWAY Wait ! This is not a trivial matter , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS Whatever it is - ca n't Langley attend to it ? MR . HATHAWAY No . It concerns you - personally - very personally . EDITH PRENTISS ( wheeling back into the room again ) Well - what is it ? MR . HATHAWAY When you had me draw up this new will , Edith - EDITH PRENTISS Oh Mr. Hathaway - this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a lawyer and a client were things of the greatest confidence ! MR . HATHAWAY They are , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS I particularly asked you not to tell my brother - and you promised me - p. 113 MR . HATHAWAY I know , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS And now you come here - and - MR . HATHAWAY Yes ! Yes I do . My relation to you , Edith , is not entirely bound by the convention of lawyer and client . I feel I am more to you than that . Your father made me your guardian - and although at his death you were already of age , and did not need me - I have always felt in that position to you - and have always tried to act as I have thought your father would wish me to . EDITH PRENTISS I know Mr. Hathaway . You have been most kind - a true friend to me - ever since I can remember . MR . HATHAWAY And I shall go on being that , Edith ! That is why I am here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you made this man your principal heir - I felt that you were acting under duress or  --  EDITH PRENTISS Nonsense ! MR . HATHAWAY Or that you were not in possession of all the facts - EDITH PRENTISS What facts ? MR . HATHAWAY I did not know them myself at the time - and in order to learn them I took a step I know will be very repugnant to you - as it was to me - p. 114 EDITH PRENTISS Then why did you ? MR . HATHAWAY Because it was the most practical - the most direct - perhaps the only method of getting the information I felt you were entitled to - EDITH PRENTISS ( slowly ) You hired detectives ! MR . HATHAWAY Yes . EDITH PRENTISS That was an ignoble - a cowardly thing to do ! MR . HATHAWAY ( ignoring ) I have their report here . EDITH PRENTISS I wo n't listen ! ( starts toward the door ) LANGLEY PRENTISS Edith ! EDITH PRENTISS ( at the door ) I wo n't listen ! I tell you - LANGLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRENTISS No ! I 'm going out ! ( he starts to move her chair back ) It 's getting dark , Langley ! LANGLEY PRENTISS ( wheeling her back to the center ) This may let in a little light . EDITH PRENTISS This is infamous . p. 115 LANGLEY PRENTISS ( holding her chair - to Hathaway ) Go on - read it . EDITH PRENTISS ( covering her ears ) Whatever it is - I wo n't listen . LANGLEY PRENTISS Then we will shout ! EDITH PRENTISS ( taking her hands down - speaking with dignity ) What is it , Mr. Hathaway ? MR . HATHAWAY You tell her , Langley - you are her brother . LANGLEY PRENTISS It tells where your Sidney passes his time in the afternoons when you believe he is praying . EDITH PRENTISS I know ! In an East Indian Temple down by - LANGLEY PRENTISS In an East Indian house of prostition ! EDITH PRENTISS No ! LANGLEY PRENTISS A place frequented by the lowest dregs of the East . EDITH PRENTISS You are making this up ! LANGLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syrian girl of his own there - who gives him all her earnings and  --  EDITH PRENTISS ( broken ) Please ! Oh please , Langley ! p. 116 MR . HATHAWAY It 's all true , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS Please leave me along , Mr. Hathaway . Please leave me now . MR . HATHAWAY ( goes to hall door - turns ) Oh Langley , it was wrong ! LANGLEY PRENTISS The truth can never be wrong . Hathaway goes . EDITH PRENTISS ( broken ) Oh Langley , why did you tell me ? LANGLEY PRENTISS You had to know it , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS Was it because you want my money ? LANGLEY PRENTISS You have become vulgarized ! No ! I do n't want your money . I have enough money . EDITH PRENTISS Why then ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Because I do n't want you to be used ! - by a filthy hypocrite ! Used and destroyed ! If this man knows he stands to benefit by your death , Edith ! He might  --  EDITH PRENTISS Oh no , Langley - not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go on living in this terrible illusion . EDITH PRENTISS It was n't illusion , Langley , it was more terrible than that ! It was longing ! Longing to be loved - and - to walk ! Now I know neither will ever be - nothing will ever be - Just emptiness - emptiness filled with shame - mortification ! How strange words are - are n't they , Langley ? Mort-i-fy - to make ashamed and - to bring to death - More - death . p. 117 LANGLEY PRENTISS But Edith , how could I let you go on with all that ? You 're too good for it ! Too good for all that 's happened to you . EDITH PRENTISS No , I 'm not good . I 've been wicked - and now , I pay - ( pause - then puts her hand to her heart ) Will it ever stop , Langley ? LANGLEY PRENTISS What , Edith ? EDITH PRENTISS It keeps on - like water dripping - inside here - ( touches her heart ) Drop by drop . Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for a ride now , Miss Edith ? EDITH PRENTISS ( looks at him - then laughs ) Go for a ride ? You sound like a ganster , Sidney ! Are you ? ( puts her hand suddenly to her side and makes a sound ) Ah - ah - LANGLEY PRENTISS What is it , Edith ? EDITH PRENTISS Pain ! Terrible pain ! ( her head falls to one side ) LANGLEY PRENTISS ( rushing to door ) Mrs. Meeker ! Mrs. Meeker ! SIDNEY ( goes to Edith ) Shall I lift you , dearest ? - shall I put you on your bed ? p. 118 EDITH PRENTISS ( lifts her head , stares at him with blank hatred ) No . You will never put me oh my bed ! SIDNEY But loved one ! EDITH PRENTISS No loved one ! No ! No loved one ! Mrs. Meeker on . LANGLEY PRENTISS Here 's the nurse , Edith . EDITH PRENTISS No nurse ! No ! No nurse ! ( struggles to get up ) Not like this ! Not like this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ! ( she gets up ) Oh God - let me walk - the last step - walk ! Kate appears at terrace door - followed by Erdmann . EDITH PRENTISS ( stretches out her arms to her ) Kate ! Help me ! ( she takes one step toward Kate - falls in death ) CURTAIN p. 119 Act 3 , Scene 2 ACT IIIScene 2 The set is the same as Scene 1 . The time : - Shortly after . KATE and ERDMANN are on stage . They sit side-by-side - not moving . Kate holds on to Erdmann 's hand . KATHERINE ASHTON ( as he moves his hand reaches for it back ) Do n't take your hand away , Erich ! It helps me . ERICH ERDMANN It 's going to sleep , dear . KATHERINE ASHTON ( relinquishing it ) I 'm sorry . ERICH ERDMANN ( putting it back ) No matter . Mrs. Meeker on from Edith 's room . MRS . MEEKER I 'm glad you 're still here , Miss Kate . KATHERINE ASHTON I would n't leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this sort of thing alone . ( she folds Edith 's rug over the arm of the chair ) ERICH ERDMANN No one is . KATHERINE ASHTON He should n't stay in there ! MRS . MEEKER I told him to come away and rest - but he won't. ( she crosses to hall door - turns ) You could go in and see her now , Miss Kate - if - p. 120 KATHERINE ASHTON No - MRS . MEEKER She looks very nice . KATHERINE ASHTON I want to remember her - as I always saw her - sitting there in her little chair . MRS . MEEKER She has a beautiful look on her face - so - content . Mrs. Meeker goes . KATHERINE ASHTON My mother had that look , Erich . What do they see ? ERICH ERDMANN Death is - release - dear . KATHERINE ASHTON But it 's as though they saw - something . ERICH ERDMANN Your aunt saw you , Kate . The look came into her face - then - before - just at the last moment - as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , Erich ! She did call out to me ! ERICH ERDMANN Strange when we know that she put you out ! Why did she , Kate . KATHERINE ASHTON I do n't know . ERICH ERDMANN There must have been some reason ! KATHERINE ASHTON I do n't know ! I 've always told you ! I do n't know ! Mrs. Meeker on from hall . She crosses to inner door - knocks . Langley appears . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( in the doorway ) Yes , Mrs. Meeker ? p. 121 MRS . MEEKER He 's gone , Sir . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( confused ) Who ? MRS . MEEKER Mr. Sidney , sir . LANGLEY PRENTISS Oh  --  MRS . MEEKER You said to keep you informed about him -- so I went out to his room . LANGLEY PRENTISS Oh yes -- very good --  thank you . When did he go ? MRS . MEEKER I think right away --  after you put him out . He took the car , sir . LANGLEY PRENTISS Good ! Then he may not come back . MRS . MEEKER Yes sir . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edith 's room . KATHERINE ASHTON Oh Erich -- it 's all too awful ! ERICH ERDMANN Yes , dear . It is ! ( pause ) What is it about this man , Kate ? KATHERINE ASHTON I do nt know , Erich ! I told you ! ERICH ERDMANN That frightful scene here ! Just at the moment of her death ! Mr. Prentiss ordering him out ! - threatening to call the policy - There must be some reason . p. 122 KATHERINE ASHTON I do n't know ! Langley comes on . He looks white - drawn - exhausted . KATHERINE ASHTON ( gets up - goes to him ) Oh , Uncle Langley - I 'm glad you 've come ! Sit here . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( sits ) ERICH ERDMANN ( crosses quietly to terrace doors - out of the scene ) KATHERINE ASHTON You must rest now - or you 'll get ill . Shall I get you some brandy ? LANGLEY PRENTISS ( shakes his head ) KATHERINE ASHTON You must n't get sick , Uncle Langley - you have so much to do ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't done anything yet about - anything . It 's all - dreadful- Katharine ! We - we are not civilized in these things . I 'm - I 'm waiting for Hathaway to come . He will have to take everything over for me . I ca n't ! ( pause ) I killed her , Katharine . KATHERINE ASHTON On no , Uncle Langley ! Why do you say that ? She 's never been strong . LANGLEY PRENTISS I broke her heart , Katharine . I know that sounds a mere phrase , but - it is real - it happens . It bleeds inside , drop by drop . p. 123 KATHERINE ASHTON Oh Uncle Langley ! Do n't ! LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes , I did that to her - drove the knife in - with my own hand . We should let the illusions of those we love alone . ( going on ) I loved my sister - but I never showed it to her - till it was too late - I could n't . So she had to seek it wherever she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor dirty rag away from her - KATHERINE ASHTON What do you mean , Uncle Langley ? LANGLEY PRENTISS ( crying out ) If I could just have made her feel she was loved ! But I could n't ! Sometimes I acted as though I almost hated her ! Her - her - weakness did not make me tender with her . It made me irritable . It was the same with your mother , Katharine - I do n't know how to show a woman that I love her . Mrs. Meeker on at hall door . MRS . MEEKER ( in doorway ) He is back , Sir . LANGLEY PRENTISS Sidney ? MRS . MEEKER He just drove into the garage . LANGLEY PRENTISS If he wants to come into the house - deny him any admittance . Tell him I - I can not see anyone . MRS . MEEKER But It 's her he wants to see , Sir . p. 124 LANGLEY PRENTISS ( more agitated ) That 's impossible ! ( suddenly ) Lock the doors , Mrs. Meeker ! Lock all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that before , Sir . I - Front bell rings LANGLEY PRENTISS There he is now ! At the front door - Do n't let him in ! Bell rings again . MRS . MEEKER But Mr. Prentiss - if he keeps ringing ! Had n't you better just speak to him - get it over ? LANGLEY PRENTISS No - No . I ca n't . I ca n't speak to him - I - MRS . MEEKER Very good , Sir . She goes . The bell rings again . ERICH ERDMANN ( crosses to hall door - turns back to Kate - speaks quietly ) I 'll speak to him . Erdmann goes . KATHERINE ASHTON ( slowly ) Why does Sidney want to get in here so much , Uncle Langley ? LANGLEY PRENTISS It 's very ugly , Katharine  --  all of it  --  all ! It seems your Aunt Edith made a new will - in his favor-made him the guardian of the baby - and  --  KATHERINE ASHTON Made him the guardian ! p. 125 LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes ! Gave him everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - KATHERINE ASHTON Where is it ? LANGLEY PRENTISS I do n't know . KATHERINE ASHTON Have you looked ? LANGLEY PRENTISS ( reluctantly ) Yes - I have . That is what I was doing in there ! Oh , I know my role in this seems as ignoble as any other 's - but - KATHERINE ASHTON What would you do , if you found it ? LANGLEY PRENTISS ( helplessly ) I do n't know ! It 's a legal document - she signed it and yet - in the last moment of her life - she thrust him away from her . Oh Katharine ! That he should benefit from her death , after degrading her so in life ! - I - Erdmann on at hall door . ERICH ERDMANN He has brought some flowers , Mr. Prentiss . He just wants to lay them beside her himself- Would it not be well - to allow that ? LANGLEY PRENTISS No ! Impossible ! Tell him - NO ! ERICH ERDMANN Very well , Mr. Prentiss . He goes . LANGLEY PRENTISS ( calling ) Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't Hathaway come ! p. 126 KATHERINE ASHTON Erich will help you . LANGLEY PRENTISS Erich ? KATHERINE ASHTON Yes - Mr. Erdmann . LANGLEY PRENTISS I do n't want help - from a man like that ! KATHERINE ASHTON Why not ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Because he is not a decent person . KATHERINE ASHTON Why not ? LANGLEY PRENTISS You know the answer to that , I think . KATHERINE ASHTON No , I do not . LANGLEY PRENTISS Does n't he pay the rent for your apartment ? And all your other bills ? KATHERINE ASHTON Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS You do n't pretend you earn it , do you ? KATHERINE ASHTON No . LANGLEY PRENTISS Well , that 's what I mean by saying  --  KATHERINE ASHTON No matter what you say - or what you think , Uncle Langley , you ca n't degrade me . LANGLEY PRENTISS Good God ! KATHERINE ASHTON What ? p. 127 LANGLEY PRENTISS Those were almost exactly the very words your mother once used to me - " No matter what you say or think - you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to - Uncle Langley ? LANGLEY PRENTISS I was accusing her , yes . KATHERINE ASHTON Of what ? Of having had lovers ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Yes - and of marrying me without telling me - KATHERINE ASHTON I suppose she thought you knew . LANGLEY PRENTISS You 're following almost exactly her pattern , Katharine ! She began at eighteen with a man old enough to be her father ! Has he given you a string of pearls , too ? KATHERINE ASHTON What do you mean ? LANGLEY PRENTISS That was her necklace , Katharine ! That she called her rosary ! Afterwards - she gave it to each lover and let him add a pearl ! And that 's what she pointed to when she told me I could n't degrade her ! " True - I 've had lovers ! - but each man loved and valued me - like a pearl ! " Ha ! KATHERINE ASHTON Well , Uncle Langley , I point to the same thing . It 's from those pearls I have been living . Mr. Erdmann holds them in pawn for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LANGLEY PRENTISS He had them all the time ? KATHERINE ASHTON No , Aunt Edith had them - and gave them to me - the day she sent me away - LANGLEY PRENTISS She sent you ? KATHERINE ASHTON Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS Why ? Erdmann on at hall door . ERICH ERDMANN He has gone . LANGLEY PRENTISS Where ? ERICH ERDMANN I do n't know . But has left the door - very peacefully - ( he turns to go again ) LANGLEY PRENTISS Mr. Erdmann . ERICH ERDMANN ( turning back ) Yes ? LANGLEY PRENTISS Katharine has just told me that she has given over to you my late wife 's necklace - in pawn - one might call it . ERICH ERDMANN Yes . LANGLEY PRENTISS I find it a very undignified proceedure - if you will let me know the accrued indebtedness . ERICH ERDMANN There is no indebtedness . LANGLEY PRENTISS Surely Katharine has n't earned anything near what you 've given her . p. 129 ERICH ERDMANN I can never repay all she has given me. ( as Langley makes a gesture ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LANGLEY PRENTISS At your convenience . ERICH ERDMANN Immediately .
