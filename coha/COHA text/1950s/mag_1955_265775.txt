When 2,000 happy motorcyclists roared through the streets of Buenos Aires one day last week to honor " Argentina 's No. 1 Motorcyclist , " the parade was led by none other than the No. 1 motorcyclist himself . At the Casa Rosada ( Pink House , Argentina 's White House ) , President Juan Pern , decked out in a broad smile and a jockey cap , dismounted from his Italian-made Gilera to take the riders ' salutes . <P> Last week 's procession , which took half an hour to pass the reviewing stand , was a relatively modest tribute to Argentina 's strong man . Among the extravagant titles Pern 's followers bestow on him is " World 's No. 1 Sportsman " - which in sports-worshiping Argentina is rather more eulogistic than calling him , say , " World 's No. 1 Statesman . " In his younger days Pern was a boxer , skier , crack shot , swordsman , horseman , speedboater and racing-car driver . But in recent years motorcycling has become the aging ( 59 ) No. 1 sportsman 's No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds of his suburban estate or his downtown presidential residence , and now and then he rides through the city streets , accompanied by two or three police cars . <P> Some of Pern 's countrymen see a method in the President 's motorcycle madness . His enthusiasm boosts demand for motorcycles ( which the government manufactures ) and eases the hunger for U.S. automobiles ( which the government keeps out with import fences in order to save scarce dollars ) . But whatever such practical motives Pern may have , the main reason for his addiction to motorcycling appears to be simply that he gets a huge kick out of the sport . <P> Counterattack Strongman Juan Pern signed into law last week a bill making divorce legal in Argentina for the first time in the nation 's history . The next day , the official Vatican newspaper , Osservatore Romano , printed its first denunciation of Pern &; Co. ' s running feud with the Roman Catholic Church ( TIME , Nov. 1 et seq . ) . In its front-page attack , the paper charged that by arresting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that by legalizing divorce it had subverted " the morals of the faithful . "
