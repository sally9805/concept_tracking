The Secret Weapon of Joe Smith A Story by Robert Wallace Drawings by Oscar Berger J OE SMITH was a gentle , quiet man , no more aggressive than a glass of stale water . He had begun his career at twenty as a reporter for a New York newspaper and at fifty was still a reporter for the same newspaper , writing brief pale stories about the activities of various subcommittees of the United Nations . When the Security Council was in session and heavyweights such as Russia 's Yakov Malik were in town , the newspaper assigned a heavyweight reporter to the UN . When the session was over Joe Smith was sent back to pick up the dull fragments of news that remained . Still , there were three unusual things about Joe Smith . He had actually managed to save some money during his thirty years as a reporter and owned a big , if decrepit , brownstone house not far from United Nations headquarters in east Manhattan . Many years ago , somehow overcoming his paralyzing shyness , he had proposed to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with five children , to whom he was a good , quiet father . The third unusual thing about him was that he was , on a small scale , a landlord . He had rented two rooms and a bath to a man named Pyotr Votichenko , delegate from one of the Peoples ' Republics . Joe Smith 's associates on the newspaper were not surprised that he had taken in a Communist lodger . It was , they thought , precisely in character . Smith was no more revolutionary than a saucer of Jello . It was his kindliness , his deep belief ( sometimes at largecost ) in the fundamental goodness of men , that had led him to do it . He had often said that if each man will make an effort to understand the Communists , all may yet be well . But his idea did not work in practice . Joe Smith had fondly hoped that he might see something of Pyotr Votichenko on a social basis , but as it turned out he rarely saw him at all , except when they passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the beginning Smith had several times stopped Votichenko and had asked him to dinner , but Votichenko , without smiling , had simply said , " No ! " At Thanksgiving and again at Christmas Smith had gone to Votichenko 's apartment , which was separate from the rest of the house and had its own entrance , and had asked him to have cocktails with - the family . Votichenko had not merely refused ; he had slammed the door in Smith 's face . Whenever Votichenko had occasion to get in touch with Smith , which he did once or twice a month when he wished to complain about the plumbing , the ventilation of the rooms , the noise of Mrs. Smith 's radio , or some similar thing , he used the telephone . " Hello ? " he would say . " Here is Votichenko . I have observed a rat in the bathroom . " This would upset Joe Smith , who had several times called in the exterminators and had several times been informed that there were no rats in the building . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same information . Or the tenant would say . " Here is Voti ? chenko . Your children are creating such a crude disturbance that I can not sleep , " upon which Smith would tell his children , who were quiet , studious persons like himself , that they really must not talk aloud after 9:00 P. M. " He 's a good man , " Smith would say . " He 's alone in a strange country , uneasy and full of mistaken notions . In time , kindness and honesty will win him over . " B UT Votichenko was not won over . One evening , after he had been a tenant for almost a year , he visited Smith 's part of the house for the first time . It was a very strange incident . " Why , Mr. Votichenko , " Smith said , standing open-mouthed in his doorway . " And Patrolman Weiss . Is something wrong ? " Patrolman Weiss , who had worked the beat for many years and knew Smith well , was obviously embarrassed . " I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've had a complaint . Mr. Votichenko called the station , and the sergeant sent me over . " " Complaint ? " said Smith . " I do n't under-stand . " Votichenko stood beside the policeman , saying nothing , his heavy face red , his eyes sullen . He was wearing the same ridiculously-small black fedora , the black necktie , and the black suit , a size too small for him , that Smith had always seen him in . " Well , " said the patrolman . " This man , Mr. Votichenko , says someone broke into his room today . " " Really ? " Smith said , amazed . " I 'm terribly sorry . Was anything stolen ? " " He does n't say . But he does say he thinks someone in this house did it . " Smith flinched as though Weiss had struck him . " We ? " he said . " We broke into his room ? That 's  --  why , that 's unbelievable . " " Well , it does n't seem as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's just that we 've had this complaint . All I 'm to do is to tell you , and warn you , since he does n't say anything 's been taken . So I 've told you , and I 've warned you , and I consider that 's all there is to that . " " Mr. Votichenko , " Smith said . " In Heaven 's name , do you really ? ? " Votichenko said nothing . He turned and walked away . The policeman stared after him , then looked blankly at Smith . " I do n't know , " he said . " I swear I do n't know . But I 've got to pay attention to him , since he is who he is . Good night , Mr. Smith , and forget it . " Smith went back into his living room and sat down . " I 've never ? " began his wife . " I 've absolutely never ? " " Nor I , " Smith said . " But I think I under-stand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always think you understand everything . The man is either crazy or malicious beyond belief . I 've never heard of such a thing . " " No , " Smith said . " Look at it this way . He 's alone here , except for the other delegates from his country , of course , and they do n't live with him . He 's frightened . " " Of what ? " demanded his wife . ? " Of what people think . Not our people , his people  --  here and at home . He has to keep proving that he does n't like us , he has to build a case for himself . " Her voice rose in exasperation . " Good Heavens ! " she cried . " Has to build a case ! Do you suppose that includes calling the police ? " " Please , " he said . " Do n't be upset . He 's got  --  well , a strange mind . Primitive . Calling the police means nothing to him , except that he can use it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Joseph , " she said . " Joseph Smith . Suppose he takes it into his mind that the way to prove he is n't soft is to set fire to the house ? " " Do n't he hysterical , " he said . " You really must try to understand . " " I do n't understand anything except that you 've got to get that man out of this house . " " I ca n't , " Joe Smith said . " I mean , I wo n't . But I 'll talk to him . " EXT day Smith found Votichenko in one of the UN corridors . He held out his hand but Votichenko instantly brushed it aside . " No ! " he saki . " I have nothing to say to you . " " I have something to say to you , " Smith said . " I 'll make it brief . No one will think we 're friends if they see us standing here for a minute . " Votichenko glowered but stood still . " Look. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand that we ca n't possibly have any friendly relations , and even that you 've got to  --  that you think you 've got to  --  take certain steps . But I want to warn you . No more police , no more trouble like that . It 's too much . " Votichenko looked at the earnest little man beside him and shrugged his shoulders . " Really , " Smith said . " I 'm not asking you to like me , or to like my family . I 'm not even asking you to give up the rather repulsive attitude you have . But if you go out of your way to make trouble , I 'll ? " " You 'll what ? " Votichenko said . Smith spoke softly and , he thought , with good dramatic effect . " Look . You can make trouble for me , I admit it . But I can also make trouble for you . A lot of trouble . " " Ha ! " Votichenko said . " You are a fascist whelp . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you ever thought that you could be destroyed ? I could destroy you . I could do it ? " he paused and appeared to be counting on his fingers . " I could do it with words . Perhaps ten small words . " Votichenko 's big face reddened and he made a loud honking sound . Laughter . " Ali right , " Smith said . " That 's all I have to say . But if I were you , I 'd remember it . " Within a week it happened again . Smith returned to his office at the end of a day to write another of his small , dull stories and found a note in his typewriter . " Pis see me . Joe T. " Joe T. was the managing editor . When Smith came into his office Joe T. cleared his throat uncomfortably and smiled . " This is a stupid thing , " he said , " but I felt I had to talk to you about it . " " What 's that ? " " This letter . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of falsifying your stories , rifling his room , and several other crimes . " " Votichenko , " Smith said . " Yes . " " You do n't believe him ? " Joe T. laughed aloud . " Great day , " he said . " I 've read the stories . The only crime is that they 're dull . " " Well ? " Smith said . But the trouble is , he threatens to make a formal complaint to the Secretary of State . State ca n't actually do anything about it , of course , but it could embarrass everybody . " " I see . What do you want me to do ? " " Well , " Joe T. said , " be nice to him . Butter him up . You understand , it 's a ridiculous thing but there 's no sense in ? " " Sure , " Smith said . " I understand . " " Good . " Three days passed before Smith found Votichenko again . Once more he held out his hand and once more Votichenko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you before ? " Smith said . " I have the list of words I mentioned to you . Ten of them . Tonight I am going to use two . " Votichenko laughed . " You do read , do n't you ? " Smith said . " The newspapers ? " Votichenko continued to laugh . T ATE that afternoon Smith sat at his typewriter and began another story . It had to do with the subcommittee on cultural relations , of which Votichenko was a member . " Pleasant , warm-hearted Pyotr Votichenko ? " he wrote , then stopped . Warm-hearted . He thought . I wonder whether that counts as one word , or two ? One , I suppose . " Pleasant , warm-hearted Pyotr Votichenko , delegate from --  Next evening as Smith sat in his living room the telephone rang . " Hello ? Here is Votichenko . I have read your lying , filthy story . I forbid you ever to write my name again . " " Forbid ? " Smith said . " Really ? " " I forbid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's impossible . I have already written the story for tomorrow . It contains two words that may be of interest to you . Good night . " The words , which Smith had arrived at alter considerable thought , were " constructive " and " co-operative . " A day later when Voticlienku called again , his voice had an edge of terror . " Mr. Smith , " he said . " I forbid ? " " Forbid ? " " I implore you ? " " Ah . That 's a nice word . " " Please du not write any more . " But that 's impossible . I have already written ? " " No ! " Votichenko shouted . " Yes . " Smith paused . " Please . There will be no more trouble . " " Ever ? " " Never . Upon my word . " " 1 do n't know , " Smith said . " Your word ? " " Please . I beg you . " " Very well . But I must ask you to bear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have used only four . " " I will bear it in mind . " " Good night , then . " " Good night . " Smith hung up the telephone , then picked it up once more and called the newspaper office . " Composing room , please . " " Yes ? " " This is Joe Smith . I have a little story on the UN that should be on the slab now . Will you make a change for me ? " " Sure- " You 'll find a reference to a man named Pyotr Votichenko . I called him friendly and pro-Western . Will you kill the adjectives ? " " Right . Did you get sore at him or some -- thing ? " " No , I 'm not angry at him . Just kill them . Thanks . " He hung up the telephone . " What 's wrong with you ? " his wife said . " Why are you sitting there looking so toothy ? " " Nothing , " Smith said . " I 've taken care of Votichenko . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know something ? " " What ? " " If I were  --  if I had the inclination  --  I could ruin most of the Communists in the world . The ones outside Russia , anyway . I could arrange to have every steamship loaded with Communists being called home to be shot . " " Have you lost your mind ? " " No . It 's just a little idea I have . I do n't suppose I 'll ever do anything with it . "
