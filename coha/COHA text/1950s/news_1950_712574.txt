Letters to The Times A Revised Policy for Spain Case for Establishment of Relations With Present Regime Presented To THE EDITOR OF THE NEVI YORK TIMES : In the current discussion about friendship with Spain an important admission was made in THE TIMES ' editorial ( " Recognizing Franco , " Dec. 22 , 1949 ) . This reads ' es9 follows : " It was wrong and , short-sighted to withdraw the chiefs of diplomatic mission in the first place . " One could go . further and acknowledge that the policy of attempted ostracism , adopted under an impression that the Soviets would be suitably appeased , has proved not only bad in principle but also a failure in practice . It had exactly the opposite effect to that intended : it consolidated overwhelming popular sentiment behind the head of the Spanish state as the symbol of resistance against outside interference . Indeed , according to the Madrid correspondent of THE NEW YORK TIMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For that result , the constant drumfire of foreign dictation is largely responsible . THE TIMES is correct , and so was Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg , in pointing out that the Spanish question should be considered in its " proper framework " and in the light of all pertinent Resolutions of the U. N. General Assembly . But readers of THE TIMES have a right to expect the whole record to be rehearsed and studied . Although the so-called " Franco Fascist regime , " without arty opportunity for self-defense , was denounced and a Resolution was passed in 1946 recommending the withdrawal of chiefs of diplomatic mission from Madrid , it is untrue to assert that such a policy has been " reaffirmed by the Assembly . " Failed of Two-thirds Vote When the " identical 1946 Resolution " was brought up- again in 1947 , " according to the rules , " by the Sovietdominated Polish delegation , it failed to receive the necessary two-thirds vote and in the official minutes of the General Assembly reporter was recorded as " rejected . " This is one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borchard of Yale University and Dr. George Finch , former editor of the American Journal of International Law , judge the 1946 Resolution to be " invalid . " Consequently , a number of nations , including some in the Western Hemisphere , considered themselves free to maintain , or to restore , a full complement of diplomatic officials in Spain . More recently , In May , 1949 ; a decisive majority ( 26 to 15 , with 16 abstentions ) supported the motion , proposed by Brazil , Bolivia , Colombia and Peru , to leave all nations free to send , or not to send , " Ambassadors and Ministers Plenipotentiary " to Madrid . At the same time , and this is a point of genuine importance , the proposal of Sovietized Poland to repeat the 1945-1946 denunciation of the present Spanish Government as " fascist " and as " having been imposed by the Axis " was soundly beaten by a vote of 32 to 11 , A Similar fate , by more resounding majorities , was inflicted upon all other Resolutions urged upon the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the defeat of these Soviet-inspired motions , the whole case against Spain fell to the ground . Review of Polley In view of this historical sequence , it would appear to be reasonable to expect our country , democratically , to review its Spanish policy without delay . Since a mistake , admittedly , was made ing946 , the sooner we admit our error and try to repair the damage done , the more secure will be the people of the United States and the more advantageously we can provide for our national interests . If we do what is right there is no solid ground for belief that " the shock to public opinion in Western Europe , and especially in France and Great Britain , would be enormous . " Has not Winston Churchill called , repeatedly , for a revision of bankrupt policy toward Spain ? Did not the French Government , despite Leftist clamors , reopen its Pyrenees frontier and resume a lucrative trade with the Spanish people ? Has it been forgotten that The Times of London , calling for an end to hypocrisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 ) described the attempted ostracism of Spain a " futile ges-ture " ? The public , here and abroad , will recognize a policy of good-will and fairness toward the people of Spain . Dr. JOSEPH F. THORNING , Associate Editor of World Affairs . Washington , Jan. 10 , 1950 . Government by Personal Opinion To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In conformity with your policy of informing the public on aspects of the state and civil rights , THE TIMES of Jan. 9 carries an article from Washington in which you describe the Attorney General of the United States as having " fully reviewed " the wiretapping activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , and quote him as seeing " no reason at the present time for any change in the agency 's policy . " I mention this as one aspect of the current evolution of the American theory of civil rights . The basic law of our country , i.e. ; the Constitution of the United States , informs us in the Fourth Amendment of the " right of the people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures . " The Supreme Court of the United States has given various interpretations of this Amendment , and has also expressed its opinion on the question of wiretapping . Quite aside from any legal interpretation of our rights as American citizens , I believe that it may truthfully be said that most of us have been brought up to believe in the Anglo-Saxon tradition that " a man 's home is his castle . " Without mentioning either the law or tradition , the Attorney General has seen fit to invoke the opinions of the late President Roosevelt and former Attorneys General as the basis of the Justice Department 's present policy in this matter . It therefore seems to me that we have reached a serious dilemma in which we are faced with the ' problem of government by personal opinion , and attitudes as opposed to government by law . Is the Attorney General of the United States facing us with a choice of " statism " and the " welfare state , " on the one hand , and freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , matter worthy of some serious consideration by all public-minded citizens . ROBERT J , MOORS , Kew Gardens , N. Y. , Jan. 9 , 1950 . Learning About the Soviets Banning of the Soviet Information Bulletin by Schools Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : If the minds of our youth are to be trained to take an objective approach to American-Soviet problems , it is highly desirable that they be exposed to at least some material which gives a favorable estimate of conditions in the Soviet Union . Of this there is little or nothing in their day-to-day fare of newspapers and radio . The Soviet point of view naturally finds expression in the Information Bulletin issued by the Soviet Embassy in Washington . The Information Bulletin contains articles , illustrated by , photographs , on various aspects of Soviet life . Also , from time to time it prints speeches by Soviet officials delivered to United Nations bodies or made in the Soviet Union . The Information Bulletin attempts to fulfill for the American public ' the same function that the illustrated magazine America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Soviet public . America , written in the Russian language , is specially prepared for publication and circulation in the Soviet Union . Considering the traditional American attitude of the desirability of seeing " both sides of the picture , " it is disturbing to find that something approaching a book-burning crusade , directed against the Soviet Information Bulletin , is taking place in this country . It is precisely in the schools , which should be most devoted to freedom of speech , that this genuinely unAmerican phenomenon has appeared . A common feature of these episodes is the mantle of public virtue which the censors assume . No reputable excuse exists for pointing with pride to an act of censorship performed in a mood of vindictiveness . In a democracy , censorship , as of deliberately pornographic material , should be tolerated only with reluctance and regret at any invasion of the constitutional guarantees of free speech and a free press . The Soviet Information Bulletin should properly find a place on school library shelves along with the material issued by the British Office of Information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as similar material from other countries . All sane Americans want the cold war to end and . want to avoid another world war . An important step in this direction lies in permitting today 's children to have the opportunity to study the basic data of international relations . These should properly include the Soviet 's setting forth of factors which point to the possibility of the peaceful coexistence of socialist and caUitalist societies . . EDWIN S. SMITH , Director , National Teachers Division , United Public Workers , CIO , New York , Jan. 6 , 1950 . Reserved Seats for Invalids TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On my recent visit to France I was impressed by accommodations prepared for invalid persons in public conveyances . Near the entrance of each bus or subway car two seats are reserved for invalids and , as a graduate of BMTIRT , I had the long-missed opportunity of seeing veterans , the sick and the old occupying seats in a crowded car . Would it not be worth while for our Board of Transportation to consider such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Dec. 30 , 1949 . Cleaning City Hall Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Can you tell us why they do n't clean up the old City Hall , as they did the Forty-second Street Library ? The City Hall is still a beautiful building . It will undoubtedly serve its purpose for years to come . I also would like to call attention to the condition of the arch entering the Canal Street bridge . At the time of the opening it was a beautiful work of art . Now it is so covered with soot and dirt that it is an eyesore . I. FIELDMAN . Roselle , N. J. , Jan. 9 , 1950 . Disability Payments of Employes To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK In your editorial of Jan. 9 entitled " The New Disability Law " I wish to call your attention to an error . ' You state " no employe may pay more than 6 cents a week , and his payments from Jan. 1 to June 30 may not exceed $1.65 . " This latter figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 9 , 1950.
