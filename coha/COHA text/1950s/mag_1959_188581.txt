A Summer Place ( Warner ) , based on the 1958 bestseller by Sloan Wilson , tells a story about two families who spend a summer together on an island off the coast of Maine . The first family is Back Bay Boston , gone to shirtsleeves ; the second family is Upstate New York , rolling in revenue . The second family pays room and board to the first family , which is too poor to refuse the money but too proud to enjoy taking it . <P> Anyway , the air , as somebody remarks , is frightfully aphrodisiacal , and pretty soon the place turns into " a perverted Garden of Eden . " Wife No. 1 ( Dorothy McGuire ) and Husband No. 2 ( Richard Egan ) , who had been lovers in their teens , fall in love again , and one night they slip off to the old boathouse together . Meanwhile , Egan 's daughter ( Sandra Dee ) and McGuire 's son ( Troy Donahue ) , both in their teens , wreck a sailboat and spend the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Kennedy ) and Wife No. 2 ( Constance Ford ) wake up to what has been going on , they sue for divorces , demand custody of the children , pack them off to school by the first train . The adulterers get married and live happily ever after in a house that Frank Lloyd Wright built . <P> The End ? Not at all . Having demonstrated the various advantages of adultery , the film goes on to make it clear to the movie audience that sexual dalliance between unmarried adolescents is really quite all right , provided they are in love and are willing to confess all to their parents and stand up in church when the girl gets pregnant . <P> The picture has been expertly written , directed and produced by an old Hollywood smoothie named Delmer ( Destination Tokyo , Kings Go Forth ) Daves , but unfortunately Daves 's taste is not equal to his technique . Up to a point the story argues for a healthy relativity in morals . But the relativity of A Summer Place is anchored to no absolutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all holy about matrimony . And along with moral sensitivity , the film lacks social responsibility . The adolescent love scenes are an inflammation to imitation . <P> The Mouse That Roared ( Highroad ; Columbia ) . One day at the height of the silly season , H.R.H. the Grand Duchess Gloriana XII of the Duchy of Grand Fenwick graciously declares that a state of war exists between Grand Fenwick and the United States of America . When the declaration is delivered to the U.S. Department of State , the only reaction it gets is a tired snicker from a bored bureaucrat : " Those guys in the pressroom . All the time making jokes . " After all , Grand Fenwick is the smallest independent country in the world , a few square miles left over from the Middle <P> Ages in the midst of modern Europe , and it would hardly dare to attack the United States with the military resources at its command : a standing army of 20 mailclad bowmen.               @ @ @ @ @ @
