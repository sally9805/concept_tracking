" After black there is no color . " <P> Hussein Fatimi , a National Front leader and editor , quoted this old Iranian saying last week , to describe the condition of his country . " That 's where we are now . Nothing could be any worse than it is . " <P> Fatimi had had a good deal to do with putting his country where it is . The violent crusade of the National Front for immediate nationalization of Iran 's oil , the threats against those who disagreed , had brought political assassination back to Iran and had made Iran 's Communists bold . Last week , under martial law after the murders of Premier AH Razmara and Education Minister Dr. Abdul Zanganeh , Teheran was quiet , but police picked up 25 gun-toting men . <P> Strike Wave . In southern Iran the Communists , using loudspeakers , incited 12,000 of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. ' s 80,000 workers into a strike . In Masjid-i-Suleiman strikers asked for a pay rise ; at Agha Jari , they wanted control of the A.I.O.C. Transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> It spread . At Abadan 300 students walked out of A.I.O.C. classes , demanding that passing grades be lowered from 50% to 30% . In Isfahan , jobless textile workers demonstrated in front of the Governor General 's palace . <P> As weary , 68-year-old Premier Hussein Ala caught up with one crisis , the Frontists created another . An extreme rightist group , usually hostile to the Communists , they took the side of the strikers last week . In a letter to Premier Ala , the Frontists expressed " strong suspicions " that the A.I.O.C. was provoking the workers into striking , and asked an on-the-spot investigation . ( The A.I.O.C. called the charge absurd . ) Ala asked the Frontists to see him . He talked to Editor Fatimi and a National Front deputy for two hours , agreed to the investigation , and the Council of Ministers promptly appointed the committee that the National Front had asked for . <P> Still not satisfied , Fatimi told newsmen that Anglo-Iranian must go : the Frontists would rather sell the oil to the Russians or leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He indirectly threatened Hussein Ala , who has yet to declare himself on the nationalization question : " Anyone who tries to reverse nationalization will be liquidated . " <P> Moscow 's Delight . At week 's end Ala called the Majlis into special session , to ask its approval of his proclamation of martial law . Editor Fatimi called the step illegal . <P> Meanwhile , Great Britain , whose inept handling of Iran 's demands for greater oil royalties had made nationalization a popular issue , ordered the 8,000-ton cruiser Gambia to the port of Abadan . Gleefully , Moscow papers reported the news .
