THE WORLD WE LIVE IN ( 304 pp. ) - The Editorial Staff of LIFE and Lincoln Barnett-TIME , Inc. ( $13.50 regular ; $15.50 deluxe ) . <P> <P> Scientists suffer from a peculiar problem : the more they learn , the more complicated their subject becomes . Probing forever past the boundaries of knowledge , the scientist too often is impatient , too seldom has time to learn a language equal to his vision . Too quickly he takes refuge in words that reek of the laboratory , writes reports that plod through complex formulas . The layman must wait for someone to translate science into the words of the world it seeks to explain . <P> The editors of LIFE have done a large part of the job . Sifting , shuffling , simplifying the long record of man 's intellectual explorations , they have put together The World We Live In , a history ( which originally appeared in a memorable series of articles ) of what man has learned about his home in the universe . From the dry and brittle bones of paleontology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's text moves easily through many disciplines . Zoology , biology , the changing geography of earth-the exciting stuff that could once seem deadly in school-year homework-take on a new-dimension . The superb paintings and photographs that range through time and space somehow succeed in recording the life of the world within the pages of a book . As sharp and clear as the remarkable pictures , the text is always in focus . <P> This is indeed , as Scientist Vannevar Bush , wartime Chief of the Office of Scientific Research and Development , writes in his introduction , " journalism with a difference . " It is a book for every man with a modicum of curiosity about his place on the globe that whirls him through infinity . And such curiosity is a common itch ; already The World We Live In has sold 516,000 copies , should easily sell its total printing of 650,000 . <P> The world man lives in is a world whose outlines waver darkly and will change as long as scientists peer through the deep and murky waters of time . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The World We Live In-smaller than life size but big in meaning .
