Because of the rich intelligence harvest that it reaped from captured Japanese diaries , the U.S. Army in World War II became highly diary-conscious . It vigorously emphasized the traditional order forbidding front-line soldiers and officers to keep diaries . One of the men enforcing this order was granite-chinned Major General Robert W. Grow , who ably led the U.S. 6th Armored Division from Utah Beach to Leipzig . <P> In July 1950 , Grow became U.S. military attache in Moscow . In Moscow , the general kept a diary . <P> Last week Communist propagandists , in a German book called Auf dem Kriegspfad ( On the Road to War ) reprinted long excerpts from the general 's journal , proved their authenticity with photostats of Grow 's handwriting . The general 's puerile entries fitted perfectly into the Communist line that the U.S. is " plotting World War III . " Samples : <P> " The Tolstoy Memorial at Yasnaya Polyana was closed today , which did not matter much to us , because we had n't come to look at it anyway ... Large numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Big electric-power station near Shatura ... Good target . " <P> " We must start by hitting below the belt . " <P> " Anything , truth or falsehood ... to undermine the confidence and loyalty of Soviet subjects for their regime . " <P> " War ! As soon as possible ! Now ! " <P> When the story rocked Washington , the Pentagon ruefully admitted its accuracy . Actually , the Pentagon knew that some excerpts were published in the German Communist Berliner Zeitung on Jan. 3 ; Grow 's recall from Moscow was announced the next day . The Pentagon thought that the diary had been stolen by Soviet agents , photostated and replaced while Grow was staying at the U.S. occupation 's Victory Guest House near Frankfurt in mid-1951 . <P> While Grow kept out of sight in Washington , where he has been serving on the Army Personnel Board , indignant Congressmen called for his court-martial . The Voice of America sheepishly told overseas listeners that Grow 's opinions " bear no relation to official American foreign policy . " Nor did they bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
