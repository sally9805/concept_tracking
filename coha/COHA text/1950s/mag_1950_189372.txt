Picture <P> Few companies have guarded their secrets as closely as Hollywood 's Technicolor , Inc . It never sold any of its complex cameras ; it merely " sold a service " to the moviemakers , stipulated that the cameras be manned by Technicolor 's own crews . Every night the cameras were taken back to Technicolor 's laboratories . Even Technicolor employees , who are hired , according to gagsters , " for their native reticence , " often worked on only one phase of the Technicolor process , to keep them from learning the whole business . <P> Moviemakers have been none too happy about this tight control , which was safeguarded by a deal with Eastman Kodak giving Technicolor exclusive rights to a three-color film it had developed . Although Technicolor adds as much as 25% to box-office receipts , crusty old ( 68 ) Dr. Herbert T. Kalmus ( TIME , March 22 , 1948 ) did not expand his company to keep up with demand . Producers have had to wait as long as six months for printed color film . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antitrust suit against Technicolor 2 years ago , charging . that it maintained " high , arbitrary and noncompetitive prices " and had retarded the development of color photography . <P> Last week Technicolor gave in without a court fight . In a consent decree , it agreed to make its process , skilled know-how , and its 152 patents available to others . ( In a 1948 consent decree , Eastman had agreed to end its film deal with Technicolor . ) No longer will film producers be required to buy all of Technicolor 's 25 services ( e.g. , printing , processing ) in order to get any one service . Within a year , at least two Technicolor cameras will be available for rental with no strings attached .
