To Britain 's gusty , professionally disgruntled Labor Party , the last important flags of privilege in a land now heavily socialized fly from the most offensive fortresses of all-the nation 's great public ( fee-charging ) schools . For years , Labor leaders have stressed their blood bond with the common man by declaring ringingly that public ( i.e. , private ) schools should be closed down-even when , as has sometimes been the case , the Labor orators have been Eton or Winchester men themselves . <P> Labor 's committee on Education published a lengthy report last summer . Instead of thunderous denunciations of tuition institutions , it made sensible recommendations for strengthening the spotty government-supported school system . But thunder was in the air , and at last week 's Labor Party Conference ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) it boomed deafeningly . <P> Hot Words . Labor M.P . Fred Peart cried that fee-charging education " buys positions of privilege in industry and politics . What 's good enough for the dull son of a rich man must be good enough for the brilliant son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I condemn social segregation . " <P> Peart 's oratory-aimed at preventing ratification of the education committee 's report as part of the next Labor platform - ignored facts that , as a minority member of the education committee , he knew as well as his listeners . Scholarship programs ensure public-school education for brilliant sons of the poor ; and while the fee-charging schools have always been centers of privilege , snobbery is less important than the fact that they provide Britain 's best pre-university education . <P> <P> In hot-worded debate , Labor 's educational moderates , among them onetime Minister of National Insurance Jim Griffiths , pointed out the obvious : to close the privately supported schools would be vindictive foolishness , and to socialize them would merely place a huge additional drain on already skimpy government educational funds . <P> Narrow Margin . But the abolitionists railed louder than ever ; pretty young Delegate June Hay derided the committee report as a mere excuse for Laborites who send their own children to private schools . Slyly , onetime Defense Minister Emanuel Shinwell dug at Hugh Gaitskell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had gone to one of these schools ; there is no saying how far I would have gone . " <P> When the proxy vote came , it was close : 3,067,000 in favor of abolishing private schools , 3,544,000 against . Then , by a wide margin , the conference approved the committee report , which urges raising the compulsory school age from 15 to 16 , seeks to do away with the rigorous examinations that now decide the educational future of most British children at the age of eleven .
