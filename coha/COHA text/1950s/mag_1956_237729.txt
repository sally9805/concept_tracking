As the Democratic National Committee gathered in the grand ballroom of Chicago 's Sheraton-Blackstone Hotel at week 's end for the usual convention epilogue , Utah Committeeman Calvin Rawlings dutifully offered a resolution praising National Committee Chairman Paul M. Butler for the 1956 convention arrangements . Other committee members rose to add their praise . Suddenly , slender , intense Paul Butler was sobbing . When the white-haired Indianan had regained control of himself , he faced the committee . " I 'm sure you do not realize , " he said as his voice caught in his throat , " are writing my political epitaph . In a moment , I shall submit my resignation , and I urge you to accept it . " <P> After 19 months as their chairman , Butler knew his Democrats well : at that moment , on Adlai Stevenson 's decision , he was indeed on his way out . He had dismayed party professionals with his overeager , often ill-judged partisanship , e.g. , his television attack on the Columbia Broadcasting System for failing to carry the Democratic campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall ( see PRESS ) . Among his associates , his temper and taut nerves had earned him the nickname of " Mr. Bang . " And worst of all . during the convention he had fallen out with such Stevenson advisers as Jim Finnegan and Dave Lawrence over the timing of Stevenson 's acceptance speech . <P> But soon after Butler had dried his eyes , Stevenson relented , reversed his decision , and passed the word that the committeemen could go ahead and elect Butler their chairman again . It was a hollow victory . In a private conference with Butler , Stevenson made it clear that Finnegan , not Butler , would be the " architect " of the campaign . Finnegan will set up headquarters in Washington , near those of the national committee , so that there will be no " two-headed monster " like that of 1952 , when Stevenson campaign offices in Springfield frequently worked at cross purposes with capital leaders . Butler 's only 1956 duties : those of an " administrator . " Exactly what he will administer was never made clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
