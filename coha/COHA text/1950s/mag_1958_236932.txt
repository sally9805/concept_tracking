The man who made the most sense about the U.S. economy last week was Vice President Nixon . He ignored , for the moment , the economic thermometers that showed the cost of living at a new high , and unemployment compensation at a new high , too . He gave the body-economic a couple of solid thumps and came up with his prescription : some belt-tightening around the soft underbelly of business and labor , a generous dosage of self-reliance , and a faith that the U.S. Government has no intention of letting a full-scale depression develop . <P> " We can state this categorically , " said white-tied Richard Nixon to a banquet of the American Newspaper Publishers Association in Manhattan . " There will be no depression in the United States . " <P> Bad Habits . A normal economic system , said Nixon , " just like a normal human body , does not and should not run at full speed all the time . There are times when it must slow down so that needed changes can be made and bad habits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits belong to business . Since 1946 " we have been getting soft in a period of easy sales . Many businesses have enjoyed sellers ' markets for 15 or 20 years . . . We have become a nation of order-takers rather than salesmen . " <P> Some of the bad habits belong to labor : wage increases not based upon increases in productivity mean higher prices , lower sales , fewer jobs . " The pattern of spectacular competitive wage increases is relatively new in American labor . It arose after 1946 because of special postwar conditions . " <P> The Central But . Government , said Nixon , should help " correct the evils of inflation , profitless prosperity and low productivity . " Action already taken includes : 1 ) more extended unemployment compensation ; 2 ) accelerated Government spending especially in hard-hit areas ; 3 ) more credit . Government should promote a sense-making public-works program but should resist " massive spending-a spending binge now can only lead to a , hangover of debt and inflation later . " <P> " If further action should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best and surest method " to stimulate an upturn . ' ' However , a tax cut will not do the job unless it is the right kind . It must be designed to put money in the hands of investors and job creators as well as consumers . " <P> But , said Nixon-and it was perhaps the central " but " of Recession 1958- " there is too much of a tendency in some business quarters to say : let the Government bail out the economy . Government can help , but the primary responsibility for recovery must be assumed by American business and labor and the other vital forces that make up the private sector of the American economy . " <P> The future of the U.S. economy , Nixon summed up , is the bright promise propounded by the newest Rockefeller report of beefing up the gross national product from $434 billion today to $707 billion in 1967 . " It will never be achieved if we adopt a standpat status quo attitude toward our economy . It will never be attained in a socialistic straitjacket. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
