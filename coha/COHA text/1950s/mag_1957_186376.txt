There was anger in Israel as the Knesset met to debate Premier David Ben-Gurion 's decision to pull his country 's troops out of Gaza and Egypt 's Gulf of Aqaba coast . But the barbed-wire barricades that police threw around the Parliament building last week proved an unnecessary precaution . The 5,000 Jerusalemites who turned out for the right-wing opposition Herut Party 's mass-protest rally listened to speeches , shook their fists only when the newsreel cameras were on them , and shuffled off home without more than a jeer or two at the cops . <P> In the Knesset , unruffled by boos and yells of " Resign ! " , Ben-Gurion was as frank as his opponents to acknowledge that he had won no ironclad guarantees : " I must state that there is no certainty and there is no clear and authoritative undertaking that Egyptians will not return or be restored to the Gaza Strip . . . As for the straits of Tiran there is no express U.N . decision that the U.N . force must remain until a peace settlement and safeguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The problem of Israel 's security has become a question of conscience for very many states . . . The President of the U.S. has assumed a moral responsibility toward Israel . " On the showdown no-confidence motion , the Prime Minister won a decisive 84-to-25 victory . <P> The same day , Israeli tanks started rumbling north out of Gaza , while the first convoy of a 2,600-man , six-nation U.N . Emergency Force clattered in to take over the strip " for the purpose of maintaining quiet during and after " the Israeli withdrawal . At midnight Israel 's one-eyed Army Chief Moshe Dayan met Lieut . Colonel Carl Engholm , UNEF commander in Gaza , in the town square . " Everything is going well , " said Engholm . Less than 48 hours later , fast-moving General Dayan handed over the wrecked Egyptian gun positions overlooking the Gulf of Aqaba narrows , and Israel 's army was gone from Egypt after a 126-day stay . <P> There were no inhabitants along the treeless gulf shore to cheer the Israeli pullout , but Gaza 's 300,000 Arabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) more than made up for it . In Rafah crowds danced all day , shouting " Good Hammarskjold , good Abdel Nasser . " After U.N.forces freed 120 political prisoners from Gaza 's jail , thousands of Arabs paraded carrying such slogans as : " Welcome as guests but not rulers , " and " We do not accept any rule except Egypt 's . " But the UNEF 's taciturn commander , Canada 's Major General E.L.M . Burns , ordered his headquarters moved forward from Suez to Gaza and proclaimed : " Until further arrangements are made , the UNEF has assumed responsibility for civil affairs in the Gaza Strip .
