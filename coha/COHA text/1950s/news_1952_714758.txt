txt It is by now an old story that the American quadrennial orgy of Presidential campaigning does things to world politics as well as to the domestic scene . Aside from the normal effect on Congressmen , who start cutting expenditures with suspicious and sometimes excessive fervor , or favoring this or that influential voting interest , there are the international repercussions . The effects come about this year because of - the crucial power and influence of the United States as an offset to the Russian thrust . More than half the world is geared to our pace and going in our direction . If the pace falters or the direction veers , the effects all over the world will be extraordinary , and may be disastrous . What is more , even the threat of a change is enough to slow down the whole process of building up the defenses of the West . . These reflections are inescapable today as Secretary Acheson lands in London for another series of talks on NATO , the European defense Community , Tunisia , Russia . Korea and other subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because the United States is in the throes of its electoral campaign . Suppose , for the sake of understanding , that we put ourselves in the position of a Frenchman . What will he be thinking ? He will know Senator Taft 's reputation for isolationism and will probably not realize the extent to which Mr. Taft has softened his previously extreme stand . What the French observer would grasp is that there would be a difference , if only ' of emphasis and degree , in American foreign policy if Taft were President instead of Eisenhower or a Democrat . Besides , bs understands General Eisenhower to be suggesting that the United States should aim to cut its taxation by $40,000,000,000 over the next two or three years , and that , he figures , will leave no room for European aid . He reads that both the General and Senator Taft hope to bring the American soldiers back home from Germany in the not too distant future , and he wonders about defending Western Europe without the Americans or with fewer of them . He sees Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security program of $7.9 billions to $6.4 billions . It looks and sounds to him as if Americans were quarreling , undecided and far from bipartisan in their foreign policy . As a matter of fact , this imaginary Frenchman is wrong . American policy , in its major lines , is fixed , and it has not only bipartisan but great popular support . NATO , M. S. A. , Point Four , containment of Russia , firmness in Korea , support of Nationalist China , the " Good Neighbor " policy in Latin America , the United Nations  --  these are the bases of American foreign policy . Moreover , Europeans whose democratic background is the same as ours ought to realize that American foreign policy will be all the stronger if it is forged in the give and take of public debate . Without such a process there would be no democracy and no popular acceptance of the policies finally decided upon . It is too bad , in some ways , that this vast upheaval takes place in the United States every four years and that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can not have it every which way . If the United States Is to lead the democratic world it must be true to democratic procedures . Presumably Secretary Acheson will explain these facts to the statesmer whom he will be seeing on his trip What he can not do is to influence what is said and done back home , and or that score Congressmen and candidate : have a responsibility they must always keep in mind . As the world goes today , every whisper by an American reverberates around the globe , every act hat its impact from Tokyo to Rome . This Presidential campaign is not being fought in a vacuum . The eyes , ears , hearts and minds of the world are fastened upon us with an intensity that is probably unprecedented in our history . Meanwhile , there are four or five months to be bridged somehow before the decision is made by the American voter . The best way to insure that the outcome will leave the United States and the world still firmly and strongly committed to a united defense is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so if Frenchmen , Englishmen , Dutchmen , Italians , Belgians and Germans go ahead with the European Defense Community , the Schuman Plan , the European Payments Union , NATO and all the other policies that are calculated to strengthen Europe with American aid .
