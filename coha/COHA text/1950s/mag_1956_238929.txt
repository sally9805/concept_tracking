When NBC-TV produced Richard Strauss 's opera Salome a couple of years ago , the striptease question had to be faced . How would the heroine be shown on TV screens after she took off the seventh veil ? " Sheath her in a fleshcolored leotard , " said Stockton Helffrich , a specialist in such matters . " Have the camera pan on her neck . Then once everybody knows she 's wearing something under the veils , you can go to town . " <P> The advice from the expert was followed , brought no complaints from viewers . Expert Helffrich , 44 , is NBC 's director of continuity acceptance , which means he is a censor with the accent on the positive . Aided by a coast-to-coast staff of 35 , he passes on all radio and TV material that goes out over the network . But he has transformed the censor 's formula ( " You ca n't do this " ) into the editor 's ( " This is how you can do it " ) . <P> Some of the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose chapter headings range from " Obstetrics " to " Of necklines , lust and divorce . " Complaints pour in daily , blasting NBC for such sins as undermining the language by billing the perry como show in lower-case letters , and subverting the nation by pointing out in Biographies in Sound that George Washington was not perfect . But Helffrich has found that the principal areas of censorship trouble lie in 1 ) racial hysteria , 2 ) obvious salaciousness , 3 ) excessive violence and 4 ) irresponsible slaps at mental illness . <P> Helffrich went to work for NBC 23 years ago as a page boy . At the time , studio executives thought that the page boys , who were guiding tens of thousands of tourists around the Manhattan studios , lacked diplomacy . Helffrich , just out of Penn State , was appointed guide in charge of tact . Except for a wartime tour of duty with the Navy , he has been with NBC ever since , and believes that he is still dealing largely in tact . Some of his decisions depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such Stephen Foster songs as Old Black Joe and Massa 's in de Cold Ground have not recently been heard on NBC ) ; some depend on horse sense ( in the past year the word " hell " has been approved on ten shows , the word " damn " on seven shows , but the expression " God damn " went over the network unapproved when Actor Lloyd Bridges ' emotions got out of hand during a taut moment in Reginald Rose 's Temporary Town ) . <P> This week one of Helffrich 's more tactful decisions probably went unnoticed by the millions whose viewing was affected by it . Without any outside pressure , he eliminated 90 seconds from NBC 's Medic ( Mon. 9 p.m . ) . The shocker of a sequence was shot in a hospital operating room and showed a Caesarian section , including the incision and birth of the baby . " Pointless realism , " said Helffrich , " that was calculated to horrify. "                  @ @ @
