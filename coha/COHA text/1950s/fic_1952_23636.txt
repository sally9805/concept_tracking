Life Is Such Stuff A Story by Stewart Richardson A LEXANDER ELWIN had fuzzy thin gray hair , a flat nose , deep circles under his eyes , and large , shell-like , pink ears . He was a short man . perhaps five feet six inches , and had three shaggy gray suits which were identical except for the fact that different buttons were missing from each . The gray suits were always immaculately pressed , but the buttons were never replaced ; it was for this reason that I thought Elwin was a bachelor . It turned out that he was not a bachelor and that the reason his buttons were missing was that his wife was indolent . At the time of our acquaintance he was employed by a rug company which had its offices somewhere near the Battery , I do n't know exactly where . He told me that he was a rug salesman and that the reason he wore gray flannel suits was that the color did n't clash with any of his samples . I believed this . I first met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . It had been said that nobody ever sat beside him by choice , because he never folded his paper into quarters , would n't change to a tabloid-size paper , and persisted in nudging people and obscuring their paper at every page-turning . He was , indeed , a most incompatible seat-mate , and I should never have taken up his company if it had n't been for his amazing dreams . He told me about his dreams on the first day that I met him . It was on a rainy November morning , and I was late arriving at the station . I hoarded the eight-forty and found that the only vacancy in the smoking car wasa seat next to Mr. Elwin . I had no choice but to sit down . Like many commuters , we knew each other by sight , if not by name , and , since I had n't had time to purchase a newspaper , I turned to look out the window , nodding to him at the same time . " Hello there , " he said . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , " I said , allowing him to open what , I was sure , would prove to be a tedious conversation . " I had the strangest dream last night , " he said suddenly . " What was that ? " I stuttered . His face brightened . " I dreamt I was a loon . " " A what ? " I asked . " A loon , " he said . " You know , a loon . " " No , I 'm afraid I do n't , " I said . " A loon is a bird , a migratory bird , that is found on lakes in the northern United States , among other places . It is a waterfowl . " " A waterfowl , eh ? " I questioned . " It has difficulty walking on land and builds its nest near the water for that reason . " " Do you know much about this type of waterfowl ? " " No , I do n't , actually , " he admitted , " but you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal about their habits and peculiarities through the experience . " " Did you build a nest ? " I asked . " Yes , as a matter of fact I did . I also ate a trout and a frog . " " How were they ? " I asked , somewhat embarrassed . " MIME " It was a lot of work , building the nest I mean , but the meals were very good . " " How does the life of a loon compare with your life ? " " Very favorably , " he said but did not elaborate . " Have you had any other strange dreams ? " I inquired . " Not really . You see , all my dreams are strange . They are only commonplace in their strangeness. " - What else have you been ? " I asked , trying to get at the heart of the matter . " Night before last I was a weakfish . " I looked at him carefully , trying to imitate an expression 1 had seen doctors assume when listening to accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " I was nearly caught by a fisherman . The hook tore out of the weak cartilage around my mouth , and I finally managed to escape . " " Did you have any bad aftereffects ? " I asked . " Cut my lip . " " As a fish or as you ? " I asked , attempting to sound as casual as possible . " Bit it while I was sleeping , " he said sadly . He showed me the place where the cut had been . " You certainly have dreams , do n't you ? " I immediately regretted the absurdity of my comment . I watched Elwin 's face for a sign of disapproval , but his expression had not changed when the train roared into the tunnel , and I forgot him while I swallowed to clear my ears . I SPENT a busy day in my office , took a late train home , and had two pleasant cock- tails with my wife . " I met the most un-usual man on the train this morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a loon . " " Is n't that interesting . " " It is , " I affirmed . " Then other nights he 'll dream he 's a fish . " " No . " " Then he told me about some of the things that happened . . . " " Your dinner 's getting cold , dear , " my wife said . I ate my dinner , which was very good , but we somehow never got around to Elwin again that evening . . The next day dawned sunny and cold , and I got up before my wife , made a pot of coffee , drank Three cups , and had to make another pot when she woke up . I sat in the living-room and looked out the window at the barren winter trees and the winter sky which somehow seemed particularly expansive . " You know , dear , this fellow Elwin .. . " " Are you catching the eight-forty ? " " Yes , " I said . " Well , you better get going . It 's eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train . Seated , I folded my Times into quarters , and began reading . Elwin entered from the car ahead , waved at me , walked over , and sat down , exhaling tiredly . " Morning , " he said . He was very pale . " Excuse me for saying so , " I said , " but you do n't look very well this morning . " " You are quite right , " he agreed , " I do n't . " " Do you feel well ? " I asked . " No . " " Do n't tell me that you were something last night , " I said . " An owl . " " Really ? " I asked . " A saw-whet owl , " he explained , " you know , one of the little ones . " " How was it ? " " Bad food , " he said . " I think it disagreed with me . Really , I 'd prefer not to talk about it ; it makes me rather queasy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his rheumy eyes and a feeling of pity came over me . For the first time I felt the intensity of the man 's suffering . " Oh , I 'd be glad to talk about other dreams , " he said . " For instance , once I was a Blackburnian warbler . Another time I was a least flycatcher . " " Are you always birds or fish ? " I asked , trying to pin him down . " Oh , no , " he explained . " Once I was a man . " " Who ? " He tilted his head back , like an old man trying to remember a half-forgotten experience . " I do n't remember what my name was , but I was well-to-do and had a fine house on the Ashley River . " " But the Ashley River is in South Carolina , " I explained . " Is it ? I remember I made a lot of money in indigo . " " You know , " I said , " you might have been somebody important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Being animals and birds so much discourages me from doing that , " he said , " and I 've only been a man once . " Feeling the guilt of a prosecutor who had forced the emotional breakdown of a witness , I looked at the kindly little man and could not suppress another twinge of pity . " I was in a plague of locusts once , " he offered . " I think I liked that best ; the anonymity was wonderful ; and , I must say , we raised hell . " " Do you dream every night ? " I tried good-naturedly . " Every single one . I 'm never at a loss for a dream . " The train racketed along the track , and I looked out of the window at the crowded suburbs and the forest of television antennae . Elwin sat hunched forward , his fuzzy hair filtering the sunlight , reading the sports page of the Tribune . After a short swaying ride through the tunnel we said good-by and left for our offices . Elwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that talking about his malady worked as a sort of therapy . I was , in fact , quite pleased that I 'd drawn him out and resolved to question him further at our next meeting . I SPENT a hectic and frustrating day at the office and had to be awakened by the conductor when the train reached Rocky-brook . My wife greeted me at our front door with an old-fashioned , and we sat in front of a fire while I drank four more . " Elwin said he was in a plague of locusts , " I said after a while , bursting into laughter . " Who 's Elwin , dear , " my wife asked , " somebody at the office ? " " He 's the dream man , " I explained , " that I told you about last night . " " Well , I guess I was just too sleepy to understand what you said . You do talk so strangely these days . " After dinner I read for a short while , ate some cold apple pie , drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning I failed to hear the alarm clock . I arose late , hurried through a cup of instant coffee , and dashed for the eight-forty . A gentle snow was falling , and as I ran to the station , the tiny flakestickled my lip until I brushed them with my sleeve , breaking the skin . I boarded the train in an ill humor and sought out Elwin mainly , I presume , because he was the one person I felt capable of feeling sorry for . I spotted him in the front smoker and sat down at his side . " Good morning , " he said cheerfully . " Morning , " I said . " What were you last night ? " " Funny thing , " he said , " last night was the first night without a dream since the whole series started a year ago . I did n't dream a thing , not a thing . " His words had a strange effect on me , for , as soon as he had uttered them , I had the irrepressible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hazy recollection , like the sudden remembering of childhood ; but I was quite sure that I had been an armadillo . I looked Edwin straight in the eyes . " Well , I think I was an armadillo last night , " I said . " No , " he said incredulously . " That was my first dream . Did you chase insects ? " " I think , " I tried desperately to remember . Then it came to me with frightening clarity . " Red ants . " " That 's the one . " " You said that was your first dream ? " I asked . " The first in the series . The first ones are hazy , but they get progressively clearer . The armadillo is the first , and , I think , the saw-whet owl is the last . Yes , I think I 'm all over mine . " " Are you joking ? " " Not at all , but it is strange that we should dream the same series of dreams . " " That has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It looks suspicious , though . " " Yes , I guess it does , " I admitted . " lArait 'll you . get the canvasback duck one . " He slapped his knee impressively . " Is it bad ? " I inquired . " My experience was during hunting sea-son . " " Really ? " I said . " I was fairly well battered in the morning . " " Did you ever make an attempt to understand the meaning of your dreams ? " I asked . " What does a duck mean ? " he said sarcastically . " Yes , I guess you 're right , " I answered . " Did you ever go to a psychiatrist ? " " One , " he said . " He was clever on the textbook dreams , but I had him stumped . " " What did he do ? " I asked . " Told me to go to a good veterinarian , and laughed . " " Well , " I said , " what would be your advice to me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " With the exception of the canvasback and the saw-whet owI episodes , " he said , " they are all fairly pleasant , Frankly , if I were you , I 'd just sit back and enjoy them . " " Yes , I can sec your point of view . " " I knew you would , " he said with understanding . He folded his Tribune into quarters , nudged me imperceptibly , and settled down to the editorial page .
