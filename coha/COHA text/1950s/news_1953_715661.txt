txt The Labor ( party attacked the Government tonight for joining with the fifteen other nations fighting in Korea in la warning to Communist China that said that a breach of the armistice would probably lead to hostilities beyond Korea 's borders . The party 's statement rejected " any implication of commitment to the extension of hostilities in the Far East . " The Government , in a special statement , replied that the Government 's action was not new . In fact , said the statement , the warning had been agreed on in December , 1951 , when hopes of an armistice had first arisen and " the Americans , who were bearing , and have since borne , nineteen-twentieths of the burden of the conflict there , asked their Allies to consider what safeguards could be provided * ? ? against a treacherous breach of the armistice . " The warning statement was adopted instead of more active methods proposed by others , such as " bombing communications in China " or a blockade . The Labor statement brought to a head the criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gen. Mark W. Clark 's report to the United Nations , was made public last Saturday in New York . The controversy has already embroiled two of the three most respected British journalistic voices , The Times of London and The Economist , on opposite sides and there have been complaints that the news of the forthcoming publication of the warning statement was withheld from Parliament before it recessed at the end of July . It is obvious that if it had been revealed the furor would have been much worse than it is today , but the Government statement said the sixteen : rations had agreed to // reserve the announcement for General Clark to make . The statement issued from 10 Downing Street , the Prime Minister 's official residence , reopened an old controversy about which of Britain 's two major parties is really responsible for the present policy of firm collaboration with the United States and firm opposition to Communist aggression . In it , Sir Winston Churchill once again threw the bombshell that he first used in Parliament in February , 1952 , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech that the Allies ' reaction would be " prompt , resolute and effective " if a truce were once made and broken . That bombshell was the unexpected revelation that the Labor Foreign Secretary , Herbert Morrison , had already agreed that under certain circumstances the United Nations Command might take military reprisals outside Korea . The Downing Street statement contained some blunt strictures that made the warning to the Communists conditional  --  so far as Britain is concerned  --  on the good behavior of President Syngman Rhee of the South Korean Republic . The statement criticized Dr. Rhee 's release of 27,000 North Korean prisoners during the truce talks and said that only an " unprovoked " breach by the Reds could justify the Allied warning . " If there were afiy breach of faith by our side , Her Majesty 's Government would be entitled to re , open the whole question , " it said , and added : " The servants of the United Nations must show themselves prepared to act firmly and effectively and also honorably and fairly should any attempts be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Press Opinion Divided That the division of British opinion on the question of guarantees to Korea is real and profound can be shown by comparing the following quotations : From The Economist : " Former Labor ministers * * * are consistently opposed to the British Government showing any firmness anywhere ( except , of course , in Washington ) . ? " Havino- agreed when they were in office to such bold and risky policies as the rearmament of Germany , the resistance to China in Korea and the construction of an atomic bomb , having most resolutely and patiently built up strength to negotiate with the tough characters of Moscow and Peking Peiping they now fail in courage and clarity at the very moment when the policy they inaugurated is beginning to pay . " From The Times of London : " Never announce a threatening policy unless you are ready in the last resort to carry it out . That is one of the oldest and simplest rules for the conduct of foreign affairs . * * * The rule has now been broken again by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One factor contributing to the divergence in public feeling about Korean matters has been the fact that British prisoners now being released appear ? to have been almost uniformly well treated by their Communist captors . There have been no such stories as the American prisoners of war have reported of torture and very little of bad prisonco nditions . A. War Office spokesman confirmed this impression today . He said it was still too early to establish a general pattern but so far it looked very much as if the differential in treatment had been deliberate on the Communists ' part in a plan to create differences between the two great powers .
