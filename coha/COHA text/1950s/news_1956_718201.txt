txt Total interest on abatements granted in Boston can be cut by more than 75 per cent for an annual savings of approximately $375,000 , Thomas A. Flaherty , newly appointed chairman of the Board of Review in the assessors office , said today . Refunded taxes are subject to a A per cent interest payment by the city . In 1940 such payments totaled $131,512 . For the past several years they have been more than $500,000 annually . In addition to saving a substantial amount for the taxpayers , the new plan about to be installed gives more efficient service to real-estate owners and removes another bit of temptation from the sn-called " abatement racket " which has troubled Boston for several decades . The efficiency , will come through the accelerated handling of abatement petitions by the Board of Review . The law specifies that if petitions'fOr ? abatements filed with the city ' are ' ' llot acted upon within 90 days they are deemed to have been denied . Interest is waived on abatements granted within this 90-day period . and two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the applications were heard by the ATB . Just before a decision would be reached by the state , the city would settle and be subject to the 4 per cent interest payment . In addition , there was the major expense of preparation for trial and fees for real-estate appraisers . Mr. Flaherty 's plan ? is expected to reduce considerably the work of the state board , which will lead to even greater savings for the taxpayers . Another change brought about by Mr. Flaherty will remove much of the temptations for city officials that has been allowed by the looseness of the system . System Criticized There have been no cases over the years where any city assessor or official has been accused of accepting a kickback from taxpayers for abatements , but the system has offered every opportunity ? for such action . In the past each assessor was given certain wards as his " share of the pie . " Each assessor decided on his own who ' should or should not get a rebate on taxes . Mr. Flaherty is taking this out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street men , or the assessors who are hired to view the properties individually , will make their recommendations to the full Board of Review . They will " try " the cases at informal meetings , with board members sitting as judges rather than as attorneys . Reform-Acknowledged The old practice of having assessors approve abatement petitions " as a favor for a are over , acording to Hynes . The Mayor acknowledged the reform in his . assessing office ancegives it his full support and approval . " Mr. Flaherty would n't sign , an abateMent for his own mother unless he was convinced without a doubt that it had merit . That is what I want . That is what we have long needed , " Mayor Hynes said , Just appointed to serve on the Review Board with Mr. Flaherty is Edward F. Mullen , former member of the Boston Finance Commission . The third member is Huntington W. Frothingham , former member of Board of Assessors . Appeal Available In addition , any compromise made by the city within this period must be accepted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the amount , the taxpayer later can appeal the difference to the State Appellate Tax Board . A hypothetical case , as explained by Mr. Flaherty , would be a downtown property assessed at $600,000 . The record shows that an abatement of $200,000 has been granted for several years past . If it is determined after examination by the Board of Review that an abatement of only $150,000 is justified , this would be granted immediately . If the taxpayer were not satisfied , he could appeal the amount above $150,000 to the state . If successful , interest would be paid on $50,000 , rather than $200 , - 000 . With a more realistic system of establishing valuations and granting abatements , Boston is expected to have more success before the Appellate Tax Board than it has in the past . Changes to Go on Books John Chapman , appointed chairman of the Board of Assessors this year , says that as soon as abatements are granted by the Board of Review , assessments will be changed on the street books so that next year 's valuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orig. : . inal high figures as was the practice in the past . Mr. Flaherty 's plan to speed up abatement cases will do much to discourage abatement payments to pay part of their attorneys ' fees . In a majority of cases , abatements have become automatic . Many owners of large parcels would file for abatements . They would be denied by the city
