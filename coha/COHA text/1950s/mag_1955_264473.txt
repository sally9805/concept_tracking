Canada 's External Affairs Chief Lester Bowles ( " Mike " ) Pearson , in Moscow last week for a good-will visit with top Soviet officials , found time for one item of business : an agreement to start preliminary talks for a new Canadian-Soviet trade treaty . The Moscow press , hailing the latest evidence of the spirit of Geneva at work , announced that Soviet negotiators would leave soon for Ottawa . <P> Pearson 's agreement to talk trade came almost as an afterthought to a week devoted to rounds of parties , sightseeing tours , and long office calls on senior Soviet functionaries . Three of his Russian hosts once cornered Pearson at a Canadian Embassy luncheon and demanded to know why Canada refuses to sell Russia strategic aluminum , copper , and nickel . Pearson smoothly replied that the metals are in short supply . " Where ? " demanded ex-Premier Georgy Malenkov . " In Russia , " smiled Pearson . <P> Actually , no foreseeable Canadian-Soviet trade treaty would affect Canada 's strategic embargoes , which are set up under agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Russia , never greater than $5,000,000 a year in either direction since 1946 , seems unlikely to grow much ; the two countries , similar in geography and geology , export many of the same products . <P> From Moscow , Pearson flew to the Black Sea resort of Mishor for an overnight visit with vacationing Premier Nikolai Bulganin and Communist Party Chief Nikita Khrushchev , who chided him politely for Canada 's adherence to NATO . Replied Pearson : " We might agree to leave NATO if you would agree to leave a lot of other things we 'd like you to leave . " The next day Pearson flew on toward Singapore , where he and other Colombo Plan representatives will try to work out ways to bulwark Southern Asia against the spread of Communism .
