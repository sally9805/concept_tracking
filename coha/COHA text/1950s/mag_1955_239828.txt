The fox knows many things , but the hedgehog knows one big thing . - Fable of Archilochus <P> The cool veranda , with its silvery curtains and pale green furnishings , is always a quiet and tranquil place . There is a soft , slurring sound of slippered feet from within , and an aide comes to attention : " The President . " The man who steps onto the veranda is all in black-black skullcap , black Chinese gown , black felt slippers . As the President of Nationalist China stands bowing and smiling politely , the visitor notices the thin , angular face and skull , to which the years of adversity and self-discipline have given a sculptural distinction . It might be the head and face of a monk . He waves his visitor to a sofa , then takes a straight chair beside him . Barking his comments at the interpreter in his staccato , rough Mandarin , he fixes his dark eyes on his visitor , brightening with interest at a comment on Indo-China . turning grave as he states his unshakable determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at exactly 6 o'clock an indescribable look comes over the President 's face . The visitor instinctively rises and takes his leave .

Chiang 's visitors emerge with no pronouncements made , no decisions taken , but with the sensation that Chiang imparts-that they are men of like mind on the issues that really matter , and that to be of like mind with the Generalissimo is a thing of importance . In a time of confused issues and uncertain men , his sureness is so intense that he diffuses an air of tranquillity . <P> For among the foxes of the world , Chiang Kai-shek long ago found the hedgehog 's one big thing : the world 's primary and implacable enemy was and is the Communist conspiracy directed from Moscow . It was a single-mindedness that in the 1930s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of Communists ) , in the 1940s , General Joseph Stilwell ( who wanted him to arm Communist troops to fight in Burma ) and President Harry Truman ( who insisted that he coalesce with what Secretary of State Byrnes termed " the so-called Communists " ) . While many bright young foxes were finding that the grapes were bitter , Chiang Kaishek , who himself has erred grievously in other things , both by omission and commission , clung to his hedgehog truth .
