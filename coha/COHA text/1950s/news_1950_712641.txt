txt The West German Governm nt is determined to follow a policy of cooperation with the western powers , establishment of good relations withtrance , and to remain steadfast to the idea of a European union . This was stressed in the . communiqu ? issued following the Jan. 24 cabinet meeting . It obviously is the answer to the numerous questions which have cropped up . involuntarily for many Germans as well as foreigners , in view of the developments of the past few days . Notable ' among these were a speech by Dr. Thomas Dehler , Federal Minister of Justice , and the memorandum on the Saar problem presented to the cabinet by Jacob Kaiser , Minister for AU-German Questions . Aggressive Aims Denied Dr. Dehler 's speech was given at Hamburg Jan. 22 . In it he reportedly talked- about the " fairy tale of German aggression " and equal French and German responsibility for Hitler's*rise . According to the cabinet communique , after the text of his speech was presented to his colleagues , they agreed that the extracts cited in the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ideas . The standpoint of the minister of justice did not differ basically from the views of his cabinet colleagues , the communiqu ? states . Some differences of opinion regarding Herr Kaiser 's memorandum on the Saar , however , exist which have not been cleared up satisfactorily , according to the German press . Even the government spokesmen appear to have given two interpretations of what happened . Two Versions on Memo According to one , this memorandum was simply a draft which has not been laid before the Chancellor or the federal government ; the Chancellor first ' knew of it through the press . And the memorandum reached the press through an indiscretion . The other spokesman stated the memorandum was handed to the cabinet members as confidential material before French Foreign Minister Robert Schulman's. visit to Bonn earlier this month . ' " One need not be very malicious , " writes one newspaper , " to find that such a situation is hard to tolerate . " In this memorandum , the Saar is designated as West Germany 's " twelfth land " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saar and France is recognized . The memorandum charged that . as early as 1946 , France took measures that were contrary to Finally , Herr Kaiser 's memo-random again demanded ' that the Saaranders should be-allowed to decide . their political future- by plebiscite . Apart from all other considerations , the Saar memorandum is another instance where coordination between various sections of the cabinet has been lacking and where confusion exists in the government 's relation with the press . There are ' not a few in go ' . - ernment circles who see the solution of this problem in tighter control of news handed to the press whose freedom some would like to curb considerably .. This certainly could hide from the public for a short while the great differenCes that exist between the various parties in the coalition government . In the end , however , it would stifle democratic development in - both federal and state practices . Chancellor ?
