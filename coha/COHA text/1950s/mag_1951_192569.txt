THE HOLY SINNER ( 336 pp. ) - Thomas Mann-Knopf ( $3.50 ) . <P> In Buddenbrooks , Thomas Mann 's first novel , little Hanno Buddenbrook draws a long slanting line under his family genealogy and when reproved for it haltingly explains , " I thought-I thought nothing else was coming . " At 76 , Author Mann fears that nothing else is coming for the civilized world , that humanity faces a long , black night of barbarism . <P> But if Mann believes in a deepening darkness , he is not the man to write about it . In his new novel ( his 13th ) , he fastens lovingly on the past-a past of piety and chivalry . The Holy Sinner is his reworking of a much-told medieval tale : a child is born of incest , lives to sin gravely on his own account , but finally , thanks to God 's mercy and his own heroic penance , becomes the Pope of Rome . One of Mann 's reasons for going back to the old legendary story : his notion that ; after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Old Dilemma . Prophet Mann is lugubrious , but Novelist Mann is at his most urbane . He still writes with the literary craft of a master , and this time he happily avoids the philosophical asides that have cumbered earlier books . With its playfully archaic style and ironic tone , The Holy Sinner reads like a book written simply for the pleasure of telling a good story . <P> Mann leads his characters through the guilty old dilemma . Wiligis and Sibylla , twin children of the Duke of Flauadres and Artoys , fall into incestuous love . When a child is conceived , guilty Wiligis goes off to die on a pilgrimage , while Sibylla penitently vows never to marry . When little Gregorius is born , he is cast adrift in a little boat , with a note that tells his story but not his identity . Gregorius is saved by fishermen and grows up in a monastery . In due time , of course , he goes out in the world to unravel his origin-and meets and marries the Duchess Sibylla . <P> Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his mother , Gregorius.flees in horror . In penance , he chains himself to a rock for 17 years . Then one day , messengers from Rome arrive with the news of a miraculous vision : for his true penitence , Gregorius has been named the worthiest of all God 's creatures to sit in St. Peter 's chair . <P> The Smiling Epilogue . Some old versions of the story end there , but Mann has found in others the makings of a remarkable epilogue : Sibylla makes a journey to Rome to beg the new Pope for absolution . The two pretend not to recognize each other , but Sibylla at last bursts out : " Father of my children , ever-beloved child ! " Each finally acknowledges that even when they first met they knew each other as mother and son . <P> Read casually , The Holy Sinner seems merely an affectionate embroidery of a pious legend . But that would not be Thomas Mann . As usual , he has glazed the legend with elegant mockery ; the notions of Freud creep in to jostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mann seems to say : thanks to God 's mercy , an Oedipus with a happy ending . And Mann is too good a pessimist not to conceal his own derisive smile .
