" The King of the Mountains is locked in jail , and he too dreams of the beloved land , " sang Calabrian emigrants in America at the turn of the century when young , handsome , black-mustachioed Giuseppe Mustlino was first imprisoned . Few soldiers of fortune before or since have become so legendary in so short a time . Producing romantic bandit heroes sometimes seems to be a major industry in Sicily , Sardinia and southern Italy . But bandits , though they make news nearly every week , are n't what they used to be-and Musolino 's reputation survives in ballads still sung . A young woodcutter of Aspromonte , a craggy region near the toe of the Italian boot , Musolino , like Robin Hood , turned outlaw first ( so it was said ) when he was falsely accused of attempted murder . Two years later , he escaped from jail , and for the next three years conducted his own roughhewn version of justice . <P> One by one ( on instructions , he said , from Saint Anthony ) Musolino killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in expiation of their sins and his own , he kept busy as well at a multitude of good works . He found mules for overworked peasants and dowries for their daughters . He gave large chunks of money stolen from the rich to monasteries and churches . He even kept King Victor Emmanuel posted by letter on the need for local reforms . <P> <P> Musolino 's last act as a free man was the posting of a letter to his brother enclosing some money to buy candles for a church altar . Headed for Urbino with an umbrella in one hand and a knapsack on his back , he was spotted by two carabinieri and captured when his foot caught in a tangle of barbed wire . Sent to prison for life , he was declared insane twelve years later . Last week , he died in Reggio Calabria 's mental hospital at 82 . <P> As the entire town of Santo Stefano filed silently to the cemetery , black-rimmed posters appeared on village walls all over Calabria saying , " Musolino is dead . He held liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
