Although there are nearly 300 correspondents from 19 nations accredited to Korea , the London Communist Daily Worker last week boasted that it was " the one newspaper . . . able to give a complete account of what is really happening . " Basis for this all-sweeping statement : Worker Staffer Alan Winnington is the only English-language correspondent with the North Korean army . <P> Britons were hardly surprised that the " complete account " of 40-year-old Correspondent Winnington , a British Communist since 1934 , sounded as if he were covering an entirely different war . His " scoops " were splashed across the Worker 's Page One under such streamers as : " U.S. Belsen in Korea , " " Americans Drove Women to Pits of Death . " In one village , wrote Winnington , 7,000 people had been " butchered . . . under the supervision of American officers . . . Great ditches like those of Belsen were used to try to hide the traces of the massacre . " <P> But last week Winnington did have a beat , of sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American prisoners whom he had supposedly interviewed . The " quotes " turned out to be such a faithful parroting of the Worker 's propaganda line , notably against Air Force bombings , that they could just as well have been composed in the Worker 's London office . A private from Texas was quoted as saying he had " only one complaint and that is against Uncle Sam 's Air Force ... " A major from New Hampshire , reported Communist Winnington , said he felt that " we prisoners have been treated better than we deserve . Food good , medical care fine , ten cigarettes a day , we can use the piano and we are safe from everything but our planes . " A corporal from Missouri , reported as having been captured after two companions refused to surrender and were killed , was quoted as saying : " I reckon they believed that they would be shot in the back of the head like MacArthur said . Well , we were not . That was just his way of trying to get us to fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communist press was having no such freedom . <P> In Western Germany , Allied authorities slapped a go-day suspension on the Stuttgart Volksstimme , the eleventh Communist paper closed this month for violating Occupation Law Number Five , which prohibits acts prejudicial to the " prestige or security of the allied forces . " <P> In Japan , following General MacArthur 's suspension of Akahata , leading Communist newspaper , Japanese authorities closed down 1,092 Communist newspapers and periodicals . <P> In Australia , Publisher William Pardon Burns of the Communist Sydney Tribune was sentenced to nine months in jail for sedition . The Tribune had urged Australian seamen to boycott cargoes for Korea . <P> <P> *For a factual account of treatment given to American prisoners , see WAR IN ASIA .
