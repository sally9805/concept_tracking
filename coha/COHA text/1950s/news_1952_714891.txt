txt The vast literature on the evolution of man deals largely with the transformation of four-rooted into two-footed mammals . In his newly published book " Human Locomotion and Bodily Form " ( Williams and Wilkins ) Dr. Dudley J. Morton , a distinguished orthopedist of New York , approaches the subject from the entirely new standpoint of " biomechanics , " as he calls it , which means than man adapted himself structurally in the Darwinian sense to the laws of mechanics and gravity . Engineers have looited man . over and pointed out that his arms ? have balland-socket joints , that his spine is admirably designed to support loads , that as clutching instruments his hands have no equal . But this is mere description . How did man acquire what engineers and biologists describe ? Because he has a new and provocative answer to this old question , Dr. Norton 's book is important . Biomechanics is concerned with the relation of locomotion to gravity . As he considers man in this light Dr. Morton is struck by a structure which has a skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a- backbone this relation of structural design and mechanical function is evident , but the relation reaches its pinnacle in man because his movements and his thinking go together , especially the movement of his hands . It is hard to say whether man 's brain would be what it is were it not for his skill in handling tools or whether his handling of tools is the consequence of the brain 's evolution . ? When fins turned into legs , gravity came into play . There are fossils enough to indicate how numerous and remarkable were nature 's experiments with legs that could , both move and support the body . Apes were good at moving along by swinging from branch to . branch , but they were not so good at moving on the ground on all fours . It took millions of years of experimenting before man was evolved , the only mammal that walks on two feet . How Dian ' Got That Way ' That there is a direct relation between our structural design and our mechanical functions is shown . by the furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . Man " got that way , " as Main Street would say , both by mutation and adaptation . Mutation means that from time to time man 's structure departed slightly yet significantly and usefully from that of the species . Two-headed calves are mutations , and like all mutations they breed true . Albinos are mutations . Adaptation in the Darwinian sense is a term that explains itself . Some insects have a bad taste and are therefore avoided by predacious birds . Butterflies have assumed the shape and color of leaves to protect themselves against their enemies . There are thousands of cases . Man is as good at adaptation as any creature that ever lived . Mutation and adaptation go hand in hand . If a mutant can not adapt itself to its environment nature kills it off . Such monsters as the legless animals that are occasionally born have no chance in the struggle for survival . The mutation is too great . Always the mutation must be slight if there is to be adaptation . Man mutated like other animals . In his case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the laws of mechanics , according to Dr. Morton . Use of Hands and Arms In adapting himself to bodily changes brought about by mutation , matt- held his head high and balanced it vertically and made the most of his extraordinarily mobile and strong arms and hands . Dr. Morton sees also evidence of adaptation in man 's hidden , deeply seated pelvis , in his extended hips , in his straightened knees and stout lower legs , in feet which support his body vertically and which are specifically adapted for walking on the ground . Human feet are the result of a departure from some ancestral manape who swung himself from tree to tree , holds Dr. Morton . In such a manape the weight must be carried entirely by the arms , which means that a horizonal four-footed animal was stretched out vertically , legs included . Before man came along , there was an intermediate creature , as the fossil record shows . As the result of adaptation to gravity this creature came down from the trees and walked upright on his two feet . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body so that two-footed walking and running became easier . The arms no longer served any purpose in locomotion yet lost nothing in mobility and strength . We move our feet voluntarily yet almost automatically , in the sense that we hardly give " them a thought when we walk . Feet are intimately associated with the spinal nerves , hands with the higher brain centers . That is why feet and hands are so different both in structure and function . It is Dr. Morton 's contention that the brain was able to develop because hands were thus freed from locomotion . That is how man became a hewer of wood , a digger , a quarrier of stone , a miner ? in short , a tool-user . To prove his point Dr. Morton points to the anthropoid apes . The brain of man and the chimpanzee came from the same ancestral type , but the hands of the chimpanzee and his relatives were never separated from locomotion . As Dr. Morton sees it , the interaction between locomotor structures and gravity made man what he is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
