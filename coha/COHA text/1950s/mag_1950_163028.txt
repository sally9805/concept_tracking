Ever since the Allied Council for Japan was set up at war 's end , the Russian members have battled doggedly with U.S. representatives over everything from land reform to schoolbook censorship . But from the start they appeared more or less resigned to U.S. predominance in Japanese affairs , and the council was spared the almost daily Russian flare-ups and walkouts of the now comatose Allied Control Council in Berlin . One day last week the Russian tactics changed : burly Lieut . <P> <P> General Kuzma N. Derevyanko finally kicked up a typically Russian uproar . <P> Cause of the incident was a touchy , tragic subject . When Russia concluded her one-week war against Japan in 1945 , she scooped up a total of 2,400,000 prisoners , soldiers and civilians alike . Last week , 376,000 Japanese were still listed as Russian prisoners , and U.S. officials estimated grimly that most of them had died in Russian labor camps . <P> Derevyanko had known in advance that the subject was on the council 's agenda for the day . Just before U.S. Representative William J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their treatment of Japanese prisoners , Derevyanko took the floor himself , went through the formality of charging " American imperialists " with cooperating with " Japanese Fascists . " Having had his say , Derevyanko stalked moodily out of the meeting room . <P> Next day , the problem of the prisoners gave Derevyanko new troubles . When his car pulled up to the Soviet embassy shortly after noon , he found the gate closed , the compound surrounded by some 400 sad-eyed Japanese who wanted an answer to a petition in which they begged information on their missing relatives Derevyanko sneaked into the embassy by the back door , later sent an interpreter out to deal with the crowd . He got the petitioners to disperse on promise of an answer this week . <P> Said General Douglas MacArthur of Derevyanko 's walkout : " I can well understand the reluctance of the Soviet member to listen to so gruesome and savage a story in all its harrowing barbarity . It would well chill and sicken even a hardened old soldier . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
