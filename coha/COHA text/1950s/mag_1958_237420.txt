For 30 years Businessman E. L. Cord talked rarely and acted boldly ; as a result , out of ships , airplanes , automobiles and real estate , Cord built a financial empire . Starting in 1956 , he also got his feet wet in Nevada politics ( as a state senator ) , and enjoyed the sensation . By last spring , as a result , a new empire was shaping up . A Cord machine dominated the state Democratic convention , paved the path for Errett Lobban Cord to become governor ( TIME , May 19 ) . <P> But apparently Businessman Cord forgot that successful politicians talk often and act cautiously . Cord somehow never filed for governor , gave no reason , left an impression that his health was poor . Incautiously he backed lackluster Harvey Dickerson , 53 , Nevada attorney general and a habitual also-ran , for the governor 's nomination , unabashedly poured an estimated $75,000 into Dickerson 's campaign . When enterprising Dickerson Opponent Grant Sawyer , Elko County district attorney , cried that Cord was buying the governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cord ignored the charge . The impression took root ; by last week Nevadans had decided they did not like Cord . Underdog Sawyer , 39 , handily ( 20,168-13,345 ) whipped Cordman Dickerson in the primary , is expected to give Republican Governor Charles Russell , running for reelection , a hard time in November . Down the drain with Loser Dickerson went not only E.L . ' s $75,000 but also his chances of running Nevada .
