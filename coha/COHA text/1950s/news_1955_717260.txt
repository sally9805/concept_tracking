txt special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , Aug. 6 ? The economic trend is inflationary , mild but creeping . The Government took notice of it twice in a week . It puts restraints into effect on two fronts , those of home mortgages and borrowing by banks . That made at least six times this year that it had applied the brakes to credit . A remarkable feature of the booming economy is the stable behavior of the price indexes . The consumer and the wholesale price indexes have fluctuated within an extremely narrow range let two years or more . There was no movement that could be called a trend . Now there are signs of restlessness . Mostly these signs are in the wholesale markets , especially in metals . The world sup-1 ply of most metals is tight . Higher industrial prices at the wholesale level will eventually find their way into consumer goods prices in some degree . To what degree depends on a great attribute of American industry , be it called automation or simply increased efficiency . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and material costs . Wholesale Prices The wholesale price index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics , Department of Labor , has been steady to lower this year , but the averages mask what has been going on among the index 's components . The prices of farm products and processed foods have been dropping , the costs of industrial goods have been going up . The industrial goods index , a part of the wholesale index , stood at 116.4 for the week ended Aug , 2 . This is more than a point above the January figure and less than a point below the Korean War high of March , 1951 . Higher prices for aluminum , just announced , and a probable copper price rise will send this index up further . The recent rise in the index resulted mainly from price increases for steel , rubber , tin and metal scrap , Steel prices were increased an average of $7.50 a ton following negotiation of new labor contracts . The B. L. S. index of rubber prices at wholesale went from 142.4 in May to 149.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for natural rubber . This is already being reflected in announced price increases for automobile tires . Just the threat of higher prices usually sends business houses to market to stock up . Consumers sometimes do the same thing . This cuts further into the supply of goods and accelerates the price rise . The consumer price index moved forward in June for the first time in seven months . This was attributed mainly to higher prices for food , housing , transportation , personal care and medical care . Food Prices As far as the cost of living is concerned , the only bright spot for the consumer is the Agriculture Department 's report that plentiful supplies should reduce the price of food at retail in the next few months . The Government 's concern with bubbles on the boom has been manifested a number of times this year . Early in the year the Federal Reserve System thought it wise to put a little damper on speculative buying of stocks , It required buyers to put up at least 60 per cent cash for stocks instead of 50 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . In the spring the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate , just as it did again the other day . These increases required banks to pay more for money they borrowed from Federal Reserve banks . Such steps are supposed to put a curb on bank lending . A few months ago the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration tightened up a little on home-buying terms , but it was the mildest kind of move . A week ago they tightened up some more . The nodown-payment deal for veterans is out . The down payment for F. H. A. insured mortgages is higher , The maximum payoff period is twenty-five years instead of thirty , which means higher monthly payments . Credit High The demand for credit generated by the boom has been enormous . Consumer debt alone is more than $32,000,000.000 . Home buyers owe another $80 , - 000,000,000 . Business borrowing has gone up , too . To a commercial bank , one of the most important advantages of Federal Reserve membership is the privilege of obtaining additional reserves on occasion by borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Reserve bank a member bank may put up one or more notes of customers or put Up its own note . For this service the Reserve bank charges interest at a rate known as the discount rate . Loan Rate The policy of the Federal Reserve with respect to member banks ' borrowing expresses itself not only in granting or discouraging loans but also in the rate it charges . This rate is ordinarily maintained at a level that imposes some penalty cost on the borrowing bank . As a general rule , when the Federal Reserve is of the opinion that expansion in the flow of credit and money should be encouraged in the D*.blic interest it reduces its discount rate in relation to prevaq ; ng market rates . When it believes that expansion should be ehecked it raises the discount rata . The Administration believes that the higher discount rate and the curb on housing credits " has answered our problem . " will take time to tell . If these weapons prove inadequate the Feder. al Reserve has others that are more potent .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
