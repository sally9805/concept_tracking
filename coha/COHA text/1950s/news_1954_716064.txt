txt ADAMS DENOUNCES MS POLICE CRITICS ; DENIES SPY CHARGE Ascribes Patrolmen 's Attack to Politics ' ? His Choice of a Deputy Is Assailed By WILL LISSNER Police Commissioner Francis , W. H. Adams heatedly denounced the officers and delegates of the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Associa. : ' tion yesterday for their condemnation of his new supervisory system . Meeting criticism head on , he denied that he had resurrected the " shoo-fly " or " spy " supervision system . He characterized the charges of his critics as a maneuver by a " small group of dis-I gruntled and disappointed politicians " who are " office seekers . " Commissioner Adams accused ) his critics of trying to protect the " soft jobs " of their friends so that they ( the critics ) would be re-elected at the P. B. A. elections in June . " I do not intend to be intimidated by it , " he de-1 dared . With orders from Mayor Wagner to " run this department without let or hindrance , " Commissioner Adams said , such supervision as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuously enforced , " and his critics " will get short shrift from me . " Resolution Criticizes Deputy Patrolman John E. Carton , president of the P. B. , A. , returned to the attack by releasing another resolution adopted Tuesday by 300 P. B. A. delegates criticizing Vincent Broderick , newly appointed Third Deputy Police Commissioner , as " a man of limited experience " as a lawyer and without any experience in police administration and needs . The resolution asked Commissioner Adams to reconsider the appointment " because of the obvious lack of experience and knowledge in police matters of Mr. Broderick . " Asked about the resolution , Mr. Adams said : " I answer it with the contempt it deserves . If the ' gentlemen of the P. B. A. think they will dictate to me as to whom to appoint to office , they can think again . " It is sheer effrontery for this tiny group of office-seekers to try to dictate as to whom the ' Police Commissioner shall appoint . It exceeds anything I have come in contact with in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Broderick , who will preside at departmental trials of members of all ranks accused of infractions of departmental rules and regulations , was a " personal appointment ? like all my appointments . " Asked about reports current at police headquarters that fiftyfour to sixty officers had requested retirement applications , Mr. Adams said he had heard nothing about it . The Police Pension Board declined to comment . One official said the requests for the forms were part of the " pressure " being applied against the Com // missioner as a protest gesture . It would have no significance , he said , until the forms were filled lout and filed . Two other line organizations , the Detectives Endowment Association and the Lieutenants Benevolent Association , dissociated their groups front the resolution ! about the supervisory system adopted by the P. B. A. Their ! presidents , Detective James Sheol and Acting Capt . Peter Nesdale , ' said in a joint statement : " John Carton did not consult , with us on the P. B. A. resolu-I tion and the action came as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Sergeants Benevolent Association ; last night , its president , James A. Sheridan , said no action had ! been taken on the controversy , ' although the matter had been ' discussed . He added that his ' group would ' ' continue to enforce the rules of the Police Department as we have in the past . " The meeting , in the Capitol Hotel , was attended by 150 members . Flushed and gesticulating for emphasis , Commissioner Adams read a prepared statement and answered questions at a fortyfive-minute conference with reporters at Police Headquarters . Statement by Adams He said he was having the statement put on the police teletype to be read to all three shifts of the uniformed force . It read : " I welcome this opportunity to comment on the tactics of a small group of disgruni , led and disappointed politicians within the department . " At the outset , I challenge the good faith of their maneuver . Instead of following the normal course and seeking to learn the facts from me , this tiny group of office-seekers issued a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tell you what the facts are : " There is no ' shoo-fly ' or ' spy ' system in this department , nor will there be as long as I am Police Commissioner . On the other hand , there is now and ther will continue to be a rigid supervision of all units and activities of this department . " It is my view that what this city needs is active , alert , vigilant patrolmen on the street and not in soft jobs as the present Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association officers seem to advocate . " I have therefore caused a survey to be made of conditions in this department , particularly in the patrol force . This has re ( I vealed a crying need for better supervision so that greater police protection can be given to the public . " The public is entitled to , and while I am Police Commissioner , will have a Police Department which is devoted to preserving the peace and protecting the lives , property and rights of all citizens . Supervision to Continue " To that end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will not be deflected from that course by a small group of men who have engineered an election stunt in an effort to protect their soft jobs in the Patrolmen 's Benevo-I lent Association . " I serve notice - right now , that ! these men will get short shrift ' from me . On the other hand. ) every man in this department ! , will get , so far as I am able to ! give it to him , just , honest and fair treatment " My door is open to every man , ' woman and organization in the department and I will do my best ' to help them in all of their problems because I recognize that ' their problem. ; are my problems . " I do not think that it is gen-I erally known that this small ' group represents a mere minority ' of the men they claim to represent . " Nor rid I think that the gen- ' eral public realizes that these are : the same men who fostered the attack on Mr. Justice Miles Mc- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , This the same tactic , the same maneu- ' ver . and I wa.it it to be known ' here and now that I do not intend to be intimidated by it any more ' than was Mr. Justice , ' " When I came here , Mayor 's Wagner advised me that I would ' run this department without let ' or hindrance . In case there is any doubt in anybody 's mind , let it be known that this is true and that it will be true as long as I am here . " The Reference to The reference to Supreme , Court Justice Miles , it ! was said at headquarters , was to ' Mr. 's prosecution of 200 policemen on charges that they had been bribed by Harry Gross , Brooklyn bookmaker , To prove his charges that the police were protecting " widespread gambling , " Mr. had motion pictures taken of bookmakers taking bets . At the time , it was said , Mr. Carton accused Mr. of instituting a " witch hunt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an unusual number of complaints of violations of rules and regulations since he appointed Chief Inspector Stephen P. Kennedy to enforce discipline . Some complaints piled up as a result of the change in the Third Deputy Commissioner 's office , but the number was " perfectly routine , " be said . " When I first came into office , I found conditions shocking to me , " the Commissioner said . " Specifically . men were off post , men not in their radio cars , men not reportin : to station houses and men not making entries for months . "
