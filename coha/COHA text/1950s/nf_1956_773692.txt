txt // in the twentieth century . In Britain , Patrick Miller ( 1731-1815 ) and William Symington ( 1763 ? 1831 ) , poaching upon Watt 's scheme for a condensing engine , constructed a steamboat with a paddle wheel driven by ratchets ; with it they attained a speed of 5 miles an hour . They later increased the speed to 7 miles an hour , but the Admiralty was indifferent and Miller 's capital was limited . Financed in 18oz to 1804 by Lord Dundas , Symington produced a steam tug on the Forth and Clyde Canal . Again Robert Fulton was observant . The canal 's coproprietors , however , rejected the Charlotte Dundas because , it was said , its wash threatened the banks of the canal . The vessel had a horizontal engine , double-acting and driving directly to a paddle wheel recessed in the stern . Fulton did not copy this design , but designers returned to the idea fifty years later on the Mississippi . Meanwhile , among other inquisitive Americans , two were coming close to success with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a native of Connecticut , formed a stock company to obtain capital , engaged a mechanic , and built an engine with a chain sprocket to move six vertical paddles on each side of the hull . He demonstrated this vessel on the Delaware River , July 27 , 1786 . During the following , summer , he displayed a better boat to the framers of the Constitution who were gathered in Philadelphia . His third , with paddles at the stern , steamed 20 miles up the Delaware River to Burlington . By 1790 he was making 8 miles an hour and maintaining a passenger and freight service between Philadelphia and Bordentown , 28 miles away . It has been estimated that Fitch must have run his steamboat more than 2,000 miles , but the company lost money . The machinery left too little space for cargoes . The vessel was laid up for the winter of 1790 and never used again because John Fitch had not really succeeded in putting an efficient power plant in a ship . I lc went to France in 1791 , got no support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , withdrew to his lands in Kentucky , and died in 1795 disgruntled and impoverished as he had always been . Another American accomplished his purpose but did not win recognition as the first to operate a boat by means of a steam engine and make it pay commercially . Deeply stirred by the work of Rumsey and Fitch , John Stevens ( 1749 ? 1838 ) of New Jersey , a lawyer by training and in ventor by nature , was engaged for much of his life in promoting trans portation by steam . Stevens experimented in 1796 with steam propulsion on the Passaic River . His collaborators were Robert Livingston , Nicholas Roosevelt , and Marc Isambard Brunel , French engineer who had fledfrom // France and who was soon to become prominent in British engineering . By 1802 Stevens had built a small steamboat with a screw propeller , watertube boiler , high-pressure steam , and a crank engine giving rotary motion . It was as notable a piece of constructive engineering as had yet been done in America . The torque of the propeller , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his next boat , the Little Juliana , in 1804 , had two propellers turning in contrary directions . Stevens found that his engine was not as effective as he wished ; the water tubes of the boiler filled with sediment , and the high pressure was likely to cause trouble . He turned to low pressure , Watt 's reciprocating engine , and paddle wheels . The result was his Phoenix , begun in January , 18o8 , five months after Fulton 's success . John Stevens sent the Phoenix in July , 1809 , around Cape May into the Delaware River ? the first ocean voyage by steam . It took thirteen days and much creeping between wind and weather , hardly a propitious beginning for ocean-going steamers , but Stevens 's son Robert L. brought the vessel safely to Philadelphia where it served as a ferry . Robert L. Stevens ( 1787 ? 1856 ) was later to make innumerable contributions to the development of steamboats , including the hog frame to stiffen their hulls lengthwise . He increased their speed to 15 miles an hour , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his interest in railroads . The contribution of Robert Fulton ( 1765 ? 1815 ) to the steamboat was not the engine , for which he relied upon the British manufacturers Boulton &; Watt . Nor did Fulton discover the laws of floating bodies and their propulsion . For these he studied the experiments of Mark Beaufoy in 1793 to 1798 . Fulton 's achievement was in coordinating a hull and a power plant so that the combination was economically successful . He might have succeeded with his earlier effort on the Seine in France if his hull had been strong enough to carry the weight of the engine . Artists and engineers have in common unusual powers of observation and analysis . However much they differed in other respects , Leonardo da Vinci and Robert Fulton were alike in possessing curiosity and persistence beyond the lot of most men . In appraising any achievement there are always the additional factors of good relationships with others and publicity . Few have known better than Fulton the value of favor in high places and how to go about getting it . Da @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Milan and the King of France ; Fulton dealt with Napoleon , the British Admiralty , and then with Chancellor Livingston of New York , who had access to the state legislature , where the power of granting monopolies lay at that time . Together , Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton had political favor and financial credit , scientific skill and imagination ? not to stress unduly their common desire to make money . Their steamboat ( Figure 9.4 ) was a commercial success from the day of its first run on the Hudson , August 17 , 1807 . Fulton wrote exuberantly to his friend Joel Barlow , poet and politician , that he had overtaken many sailing vessels " beating to windward and parted with them as if they had been at anchor . " 1 By October , from 6o to 90 passengers each trip were taking the steamer between Albany and New York , covering the 15o miles in 30 to 36 hours . There are no data on the consumption of wood for fuel or its cost . The vessel had cost $20,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Livingston , " as this is the only method which I know of gaining 5o to 75 per cent , I am , on my part , determined not to dispose of any portion of my interest on the North River . " His arithmetic was more a matter of enthusiasm than of accuracy . The partners were soon planning larger boats for the Hudson and Long Island Sound and looking beyond the Appalachians to the Ohio , Mississippi , and Missouri . Perhaps they might establish as effective a monopoly at New Orleans as they seemed to have at New York City . // As originally constructed , The Steamboat of Fulton and Livingston was 133 feet long , a flat-bottom scow , 13 feet broad and 7 feet deep , with a very shallow draught . The tonnage was ' tic ) . An attempt to duplicate this narrow design for the centennial celebration of 1907 indicated that it was unseaworthy , and the dimensions had to be changed in the reproduction . Fulton 's engine ( Figure 9.5 ) had a 24-inch cylinder and a piston stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jackshaft geared to the crankshaft in a very complicated arrangement with a bell crank . The engine generated some 20 horsepower . The paddle wheels had 8 floats , or boards , 4 feet long and z feet wide . At first they were not in any way covered . As rebuilt in 18o8 and eventually named the Clermont , the vessel 's tonnage was increased to 182 %2 , the length to 149 feet , and the breadth to 17.9 feet . Other dimensions remained the same . The horsepower was not changed , and the craft 's speed has been recorded as 4.6 miles an hour . It was not mere coincidence that while they were together in Paris Robert R. Livingston should have taken up with Robert Fulton and should have discerned the possibilities in his ideas when they returned home . Livingston had most to do with negotiating with France the Louisiana Purchase , a vast empire as large as the United States itself , reaching from the Mississippi to the Rockies . He had been experimenting with steamboats before he went as Minister to France for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steamboat and get monopolies on both the Hudson and the Mississippi , what an opportunity // there would be , they fully perceived , to control the commerce in both great ports of the United States , New Orleans and New York ! Livingston himself attended to the matter in the legislature of the State of New York . By February , i 804 , his brother Edward was in New Orleans to make a new start for himself and to look after any interests of the family that might appear . He did this so well that by 1811 the territorial legislature of Louisiana had granted a monopoly to the steamboats of Livingston and Fulton . Excluded from New York waters by Livingston and Fulton and hampered , too , by New Jersey 's legislature , Nicholas J. Roosevelt made arrangement to participate in steamboating on the Ohio and the Mississippi . He built the New Orleans , the first steamer west of the Appalachians in 181 i at Pittsburgh . The vessel 's rounded hull drew so much water that it slipped through the rapids below Louisville with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury of the river during the great earthquake of 1811 , which caused much damage , is a mystery . The engine of the New Orleans , however , was fully capable of stemming the normal currents of the lower Mississippi ; it made the trip to Natchez regularly until wrecked on a snag at Baton Rouge in 1814 . The monopolists from the East soon had more boats on the Mississippi , but they could not hope to thwart forever the ambitions of others . Henry M. Shreve ( 1785-1851 ) , a native of New Jersey , captained the Enterprise for Daniel French on the first trip upstream from New Orleans to Louisville , May 3 I , 18 i 6 . The Enterprise , built in 1814 , had given aid to General Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 . Shreve won judgment in court against the territorial law of Louisiana granting a monopoly to the steamboats of Livingston and Fulton . Shreve obtained this finding in the United States District Court for Louisiana in 1819 , five years before Chief Justice John Marshall gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livingston-Fulton combination on the Hudson River within the waters of the State of New York . Like Roosevelt , Shreve appreciated that ocean-going hulls could not be expected to navigate the river except at high water . The Enterprise had reached Louisville only because of floods , and then it had ventured outside the regular channel . Its low-pressure engine had difficulty Nvith the current . As French was not convinced by Shreve 's report , Shreve made plans for a steamboat of his own which would move upstream against all currents and in normal water past the rapids of Louisville , to Pittsburgh . The keel was laid at Wheeling , Virginia , on September io , // 1815 , for the Washington , first of the Mississippi steamboats which have contributed so much to American literature , from Mark Twain to Showboat . Shreve 's Washington was a stern-wheel flatboat powered by steam . He put the engine on the main deck and built another deck above it to carry the boilers . He abandoned the space-consuming condenser and exhausted the engine into the atmosphere . Labor was plentiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boilers . He laid the two cylinders horizontal and made them stationary instead of oscillating as in French 's engine . Shreve transmitted the power to the cranks with crossheads and connecting rods . The cranks were at right angles to one another so that the engine could not stick on dead center . The cylinders were 24 inches in diameter and the pistons had a 6-foot stroke . The four boilers also were horizontal , and like Oliver Evans , his contemporary , Shreve put flues in his boilers and operated them well above atmospheric pressure . He risked explosions ; in fact he had a severe one off Marietta , Ohio , on the first trip when the weight on the safety valve slid by accident to the end of the lever . Eight persons were killed outright and six fatally injured ; Shreve himself was blown overboard and badly hurt , but he repaired the damage to the vessel and stubbornly retained high pressure , for he must have power and speed . As he thus rejected one of James Watt 's ideas , Henry Shreve was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed a valve operated by a cam to shut off the steam early in the cycle . This arrangement took advantage of the expansive force of the steam within the cylinders , and the device saved much fuel . Niles ' Weekly Register carried on Saturday , July 20 , 1816 , a special item from St. Clairsville , Ohio , dated June 6 , commenting upon Captain Shreve 's steamboat . Gentlemen from New York said that its accommodations were better than any on the North River . Its main cabin extended 6o feet ; it had three private rooms and a commodious bar . Its 100 horsepower was applied upon " an entirely new principle , exceedingly simple and light . " There was no " balance wheel . " The whole engine ( the " invention of Captain Shreve " ) weighed " only nine thousand pounds . " Accounts vary as to whether the Washington had side wheels or a stern wheel . The Liberty Hall and Cincinnati Gazette of September 23 , 1816 , observed , as the vessel was passing on the way to Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single wheel placed at the stern . " Pictures and other descriptions indicate that the Washington of 1816 had side // paddle wheels , but these descriptions are all dated some years later when side-wheelers were prevalent and the Washington was no longer on the river . Henry Shreve 's new George Washington , built at Cincinnati in 1824 , was a side-wheeler . Its paddle wheels were connected separately to its engines so that one could be reversed while the other was going forward , and the vessel could be turned in less space than a stern-wheeler . If ever an engineer accomplished his purpose , Henry Shreve did ? and at once . The Washington demonstrated the superiority of its shallow draught and higher speed on its trip down the Ohio and the Mississippi to New Orleans in September , 1816 . Shreve made the round trip between Louisville and New Orleans during the following spring in 41 days . He came upstream in 24 days , running over the rapids of the Ohio in normal water . The toastmaster at the dinner in his honor predicted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten days . As a matter of fact , before the railroad came and the Civil War , the voyage from New Orleans to Louisville had been made in less than five . A line of packet steamers , riverboats , and ocean-going vessels maintained regular schedules between Louisville and Liverpool by way of Havana , Cuba . The effect of Fulton 's success and Marshall 's breaking of the monopoly on the Hudson River had been like that of raising a sluice gate . Steamboats appeared wherever there was quiet water to float their hulls and distance to make the voyage worthwhile . By 1824 , as soon as the monopoly in New York State was broken , they were operating regularly on Long Island Sound to provide the best means of transportation for the river towns and seaports of southern New England . It was many years before the town-to-town companies merged into a system of communication ; even then they supplemented the steamships on the Sound and along the coast to the east of Boston . The French engineer Jean-Baptiste Marestier ( 1782-1832 ) , who came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamers and others on the Delaware , Chesapeake , and St. Lawrence , and Lakes George , Champlain , and Ontario . Though sailing vessels continued long to carry freight on the Great Lakes , it was the steamboat that accelerated the growth of population and the rise of the lake ports of Buffalo , Cleveland , Detroit , Milwaukee , and Chicago . The industries of Chicago may be attributed in largest part to the railroad , but the steamboat carrying grain , iron ore , and general cargoes made a tremendous contribution , as it had done to the earlier development of Cincinnati on the Ohio River . The need , the distances , the incentives were . less in Europethan in // the United States . There was , accordingly , notwithstanding Marestier 's optimistic report , less haste in adopting the steamboat for the waterways of the British Isles and the European Continent . In 1811 Henry Bell ( 1767-1830 ) had produced the Cornet , a 4o-foot boat with a 4-horsepower engine , and had operated it three times a week on the Clyde from Glasgow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y2 hours . It was not , however , a commercial success , and so Bell turned it into a " jaunting boat " to tour the coasts of England , Ireland , and Scotland , as he said , " to show the public the advantage of steamboat navigation over the other mode of sailing . " ' The engine is on display in the Science Museum , South Kensington , London . In 1815 , after Fulton 's death , a project for the Russian government led Charles Baird to put an engine in a barge on the Neva and in 1817 to construct another steamboat . The English Channel was crossed by steam from Brighton to Le Havre in 1816 . John Rubie built the Prinzessin Charlotte for the Elbe River in 1816 . The paddle wheel of this vessel was placed in the center and covered , and its engine developed 14 horsepower . However , for steamboats the larger rivers like the Rhine , Danube , and Rhone were too swift until more powerful and less clumsy engines could be produced . It was not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapids of Floresdorf in the Danube with his steamer Francis the First . He received exclusive rights to operate steamboats on the Danube for fifteen years . Improvements on river boats came from every quarter . So many persons had shares in them that it is futile to try to distinguish any one contributor from another . There were so many improvements in details that all can not be cited here . A feathering paddle wheel increased driving efficiency . Coal gave better heat than wood . Trusses or hog frames , usually credited to Robert L. Stevens , although the ancient Egyptians used the principle , stiffened the long shallow hulls which otherwise would have been too flexible . A skeleton diamond-shaped iron walking beam , first used in 1823 , applied the laws of stress to maintain the strength of the beam while reducing its weight as compared with solid wooden beams . Boiler pressures increased with the introduction of compound engines of Hornblower 's type . Steamships were slower in getting upon the high seas because of conservative devotion to sailing ships , although they had still to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncertainties in the engines , especially , and the space required for fuel held in check full reliance upon steam for ocean-going vessels . If their fuel gave out , they could not drop down with the current to the next woodpile or coal bin . So unreliable was steam power on the seas that it was nearly 1900 before even the great liners abandoned auxiliary sailing rig for emergencies . The first transatlantic voyage with steam has been credited to the Savannah ( Figure 9.6 ) , a full-rigged ship of 350 tons . Carrying no // passengers or cargo , it left its home port of Savannah , Georgia , on May 26 , 1819 , for St. Petersburg , now Leningrad , at the far end of the Baltic Sea . Its owners hoped to capitalize Russian interest in American steamships and sell the craft there . The Savannah 's engine greatly interested the French observer Marestier , and he published drawings of it . The single cylinder had a diameter of 4 inches and the piston a 6-foot stroke . It is said to have generated 72 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship at 5 to 6 knots . The iron side wheels could be folded like fans and stowed on deck when not in use . The ship carried 75 tons of coal and 25 cords of pine for fuel . No coal was left by the time it reached Ireland . More had to be taken aboard there for the run to Liverpool and presumably still more before the Savannah reached St. Petersburg , 50 days after leaving the United States . Significant as this voyage is in the history of navigation , it is altogether too much to say that the Savannah made the first transatlantic crossing under steam power . The log shows that her engine was in use only parts of 18 out of the z9 ' /2 days to Liverpool , a total of but 3 %2 days , and then for the most part in leaving and entering port . The owners could not sell in Russia , and the return voyage was not historic . The ship spent the rest of her life as a sailing vessel on the American coast . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known lecturer on science , the Reverend Dionysius Lardner ( 1793 ? 1859 ) , F.R.S. , when he declared in 1835 that a voyage by steam directly from New York to Liverpool was " perfectly chimerical " ; they might as well " talk of making a voyage from New York to the moon . " ' He criticized , too , among other things , Samuel Hall 's ( 1781 ? 1863 ) new surface condenser for salvaging condensed steam after it had passed from the exhaust . The purpose was to retain the pure water to feed the boilers again and again on a long voyage . Lardner was a very articulate scientist , on this occasion doubtless too articulate . He had good reason to question whether vessels could hold the fuel required by the steam engines of the time on a transatlantic voyage from New York to Liverpool and have any room left for profitable cargoes . Several steamships crossed the Atlantic in the 1820s , using sail part of the way . The Royal William had made three short trips in 1831 from Montreal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic to Gravesend , under steam much of the way but with auxiliary sails . The coal for its zoo-horsepower engine had filled most of the hold . The cargo which it had taken across the Atlantic amounted to " 254 chaldrons of coal , a box of stuffed birds , and six spars . . . one box and one trunk , household furniture and a harp . . . and seven passengers . " 5 Two groups in Britain were less interested in the pronouncements of Dionvsius Lardner than in the Royal William 's achievement . The Queen Company had for some time been running the steamer Sirius of 700 tons between London and Cork in Ireland , a distance of approximately boo miles . They knew how far a ton of coal would carry the Sirius ( Figure 9.7 ) . They were aware also that a larger vessel , nearing completion , was expected to cross the Atlantic , and so they loaded the Sirius with more than 450 tons of coal and sent it out with a few passengers from Cork for New York on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Sandy Hook and anchored the next day at the Battery with its fuel entirely consumed . However , a rival , the Great Western ( Figure 9.8 ) , which had set out four days later , arrived on the same day . There was much in the newspapers about the race across the Atlantic . The Great Western , in fact , might have been the first to leave for America and to arrive there had it not been delayed by a fire and by grounding at Gravesend near London . Thinking of New York as the next stop on the line after Bristol , the directors of the Great Western Railway had formed in 1835 a subsidiary steamship company and authorized its engineer , Isambard K. Brunel , to construct a vessel for the transatlantic service . Brunel and his associates made the Great Western 235 feet long with a beam of 35 ' feet and a displacement of 1,320 tons . Its side-lever engines with 73 y2-inch cylinders seem to have developed as much as 750 horsepower . The paddle wheels were 28 feet in diameter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It consumed 655 tons of coal in crossing the Atlantic from Bristol to New York in fifteen days . Before it was sold in 1847 , the Great Western had made records between New York and Bristol of twelve days and eighteen hours westbound and twelve days and seven hours eastbound . Whether this pioneering steamer met every expectation of the directors of the Great Western Railway is doubtful . There is no question that it marked , with the Sirius , the beginning of transatlantic travel by steamship . In 1851 Dionvsius Lardner denied that he had made his " perfectly chimerical " statement which had been reported in the Liverpool Albion for December 14 , 1835. 261 Cunarders began to appear in 184o . The first Britannia , a wooden side-wheeler , left Liverpool for America on Friday , July 4 , 1840 , defying superstition in favor of publicity , and arriving in Boston on the 18th . The ship displaced 1,154 tons . Its four boilers operated under 9 pounds pressure . Its single cylinder engine burned coal at the rate of 38 tons a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 knots . By 1843 the Great Western Company had launched an iron ship for the transatlantic service . John Wilkinson , William Fairbairn , and others for some time had been constructing iron hulls . The advantages of iron over wood were many : iron hulls were lighter , stronger , more durable , and less susceptible to decay . The ship 's capacity was greater ; it could be made longer and larger without danger of buckling . Iron met far better than wood the demands of the " big ship " men . The Great Britain ( Figure 9.9 ) was so large that a special shipyard had been constructed for it , and it could not be berthed at any of the docks on the Mersey . It displaced 3,443 tons . A short time before this , John Ericsson ( 1803-1889 ) , Swedish-born inventor famous later for his Monitor in the American Civil War , and Francis P. Smith , his English collaborator , had demonstrated screw propellers . They were superior to paddle wheels in rough or icy water and freezing weather ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not clog with ice . Correctly pitched , Screws did not " bore // holes " in the water . They delivered power more effectively than did paddles . Brunel 's new iron ship , the Great Britain , though planned in 1839 to be a side-wheeler , was changed over to screw propulsion . The paddle-wheel shaft , for the forging of which James Nasmyth ( 1808 ? 1890 ) had made his steam hammer , was never made ; in its place the screw shaft was produced which was rotated by four flat endless chains over a drum 18 % inches in diameter with a 36-inch face . The drum was mounted on a crankshaft which was driven by four cylinders ; each cylinder was 88 inches in diameter and had a piston with a 6-foot stroke . The pulley on the propeller shaft was 6 feet in diameter , so that the propeller shaft rotated about one-quarter as fast as the crankshaft . Steam came from three boilers at a pressure of 5 pounds , generating 1,500 horsepower . The propeller was 15 feet 6 inches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With some fifty or sixty passengers aboard and 600 tons of cargo , the Great Britain , largest ocean-going ship up to that time , steamed out of Liverpool Harbor on July z6 , 1845 , and arrived in New York 14 days and 21 hours later . It had averaged 9 / knots . Although this was not remarkable speed , the Great Britain had set standards for years to come . Old things were to reach perfection after new devices had arrived to replace them . The full-rigged clipper ships of the 185os were still to " crack on the dimity " and race through rioting seas , delightful for their spirit and their beauty . But they would idle in the doldrums , too , as steamers came droning by , bound on schedule to port . Steam Engines in Ships While Henry Bessemer demonstrated his steelmaking to the ironmasters of Britain , Isambard Kingdom Brunel ( 1806 ? 1859 ) was planning the world 's biggest ship . It was to exceed beyond comparison , in tonnage and power , anything afloat . His Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Great Eastern ( Figure 9.10 ) was to have a gross tonnage of 27,060 and to generate more than 11,000 nominal horsepower . The Great Britain measured 322 feet long by 5o feet 6 inches beans . The Great Eastern was to reach 692 feet with a beam of 83 feet inside the paddle boxes and 12o feet outside . There would be accommodations for Boo first-class passengers , 2,000 second-class , 1,200 third-class , a total of 4,000 , and a crew of 400 . The passengers were to be quartered midships over the machinery , an arrangement which was considered a startling innovation nearly twenty years later when adopted by the White Star Line . There was space for 6,000 to 8,000 tons of cargo , and the bunkers would hold 12,000 tons of coal for the voyage to India , China , or Australia and return , around either the Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn . The Great Eastern was to take command of the seas . Construction came too early for the ship to have in it any steel . It was launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodied principles which were to govern shipbuilding with steel to this day . It had longitudinal framing or webbing and a cellular or tubular design remindful of Brunellcschi 's double dome and the Fairbairn truss in Stephenson 's Britannia Bridge . The distance between the inner and outer skins of the Great Eastern was 2 feet io inches . The hull was subdivided by lc ) transverse bulkheads , spaced 6o feet apart , and by two longitudinal bulkheads 36 feet apart and 350 feet long . This design gave not only strength throughout but also safety , by dividing the interior into cells , in case any compartment were pierced and flooded from the sea . The vessel was driven by a combination of paddle wheels and a screw propeller . The engine to drive the paddle wheels had four oscillating cylinders , each 74 inches in diameter , thrusting obliquely upward under 25 pounds pressure with pistons of 14-foot stroke . It developed a maximum of 5,000 horsepower at 16 revolutions per minute . The engine . which drove the screw propeller had four opposed horizontal cylinders , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generating 6,500 horsepower // at 55 revolutions per minute . These cylinders also worked under 25 pounds pressure . Both engines were simple or single-expansion engines ; that is , the steam was used but once in the cylinders . The paddle wheels were 56 feet in diameter with paddles 13 feet long by . 3 feet wide and 30 in each wheel . The screw propeller was 24 feet in diameter and had 4 blades . There were i o wrought-iron boilers , rectangular in shape , 6 for the screw and 4 to serve the paddle-wheel engines . They were equipped with brass fire-tubes and were some 18 feet wide by 14 to 18 feet high . Each boiler had 10 furnaces in it , to be stoked day and night by hand in suffocating heat . Brunel did not adopt Hall 's new surface condenser for salvaging spent steam and reusing it as fresh feedwater . Instead he kept the old method of water jets in the condensing chambers ; sea water still entered the boilers as feedwater with inevitable damage to them from dissolved solids and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing down " or emptying the boiler periodically . Even so , they delivered power enough to drive the Great Eastern at 14 to 15 knots . The fastest clipper ships , sailing greyhounds of the i 85os , could make 18 knots with very strong favoring winds . The Great Eastern , fairly independent of the wind and free to set a straight course , would outrun the best of them from port to port ? if nothing happened to its engines . The ship was also equipped with six masts . All were rigged with fore-and-aft sails , the second , third , and fourth also with yards , and the masts were 130 to 170 feet tall . Five of the masts were made of wrought iron rolled in tubular form , 2 feet q inches to 3 feet 6 inches in diameter . The mizzen mast was wood with hemp stays to reduce the magnetic interference of iron with the ship 's compass , which was mounted high on the mast . With thirty-eight paving passengers and eight guests , the Great Eastern set out across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and arrived at New York on June 28 , in eleven days . There had been no trouble on the voyage except some anxiety over the bar at Sandy Hook where the ship had " only 2 feet to spare . " The trip was a clear prophecy of things to come in transatlantic navigation , but the vessel was clumsy , oversize , and expensive to operate . It was too large for the docks and shore facilities of the time . Nearly forty years were to pass before the Oceanic exceeded the Great Eastern in length , and its tonnage was not exceeded until the Celtic was built in 1901 . The opinion appears to be general that the Great Eastern came too // soon in the history of steam navigation for its own success . The heavy cost led to the failure of the company and to sale of the vessel to another company that was not interested in the Oriental traffic for which the ship had been planned . Brunel 's death has been attributed in part to worry about the great ship . The transatlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and range of endurance which the ship possessed . It served in laying the Atlantic cable in July , 1866 , but it failed to be of any profit on the sea and ended its days in the Mersev as a " floating billboard and amusement hall . " It was broken up in 1889 and sold as old iron for L i 6,000 , about one-sixtieth of its original cost . The big ship was planned before work started on the Suez Canal . If the ship had been able to establish its size and its speed on the long sea lanes in the early sixties before the Suez Canal was opened in 1869 , the ship might have had something to do with determining the dimensions of the canal ; if it had , the subsequent history of transoceanic navigation would certainly have been different . The Suez Canal , once in operation , made clear that all vessels seeking the Oriental trade should be small enough to pass through its waterway rather than large enough for the long run around the Cape of Good Hope and across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interesting , but the historical fact remains . The significance of the Great Eastern lies not in failure or success but in its effect upon the ultimate practices of marine engineering . William H. White 's address as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1903 summed up the achievements as , among others , ample structural strength with a minimum of weight , safety by watertight subdivision and cellular double bottom , economy of coal and endurance for long-distance steaming , dimensions to minimize resistance and to favor good performance at sea . Brunel , said White , had displayed a knowledge of principles such as no other ship designer of the time seemed to have possessed ; his courage had been justified in the experience of subsequent years . Above all , Brunel had proved that size in a ship was an advantage and , as he said , was " limited only by the extent of demand for freight , and by the circumstances of the ports to be frequented . " 6 The emphasis for some time after the Great Eastern , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from iron to steel came with the growth of the Bessemer and Siemens-Martin processes of making steel , bringing lighter weight and greater strength // for a given section ; by 1891 , 8o per cent of all steamships under construction were of steel . Single-screw propellers replaced paddle wheels on ocean-going vessels . Compound triple- and quadruple-expansion engines operating under higher pressures reduced the consumption of fuel as much as 50 per cent . There was thus more room for pay cargoes . Steam power was now clearly in profitable competition with sail on the transatlantic run , as had not been the case in the first days of the Great Western . Locomotives Following the medieval inventions of the horse collar and horseshoe , enabling the horse to pull heavy wagons , nearly a thousand years passed before the next important advance in land transport was achieved . The vehicle that superseded the horse-drawn wagon for long-distance hauling was the steam locomotive ? the iron horse . Although the early road locomotives were not successful , they have historical importance because they were the progenitors of the railway locomotive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the first to produce a vehicle which moved itself . Using Hero 's aeolipile , mechanical knowledge that he had acquired in his education at home , his own ingenuity , and spare time from his labors among the heathen of Pekin , Ferdinand Verbiest ( 1623 ? 1688 ) built a toy cart of light wood 2 feet long with the axle of its front wheels geared to a steam turbine , or aeolipile , fed by a vessel full of live coals . Verbiest made his tiny vehicle move in a circle " with a motion and not slow for an hour or more , for as long a time , be it understood , as the steam continued to be forcefully expelled from the aeolipile. " 7 Verbiest seems to have made his little cart some time between 1665 and 1681 . An account of it first appeared in Europe at Dillingen , Bavaria , in 1687 , in a chapter on " Pneumatica " in the abbe 's book Astronomic Europaea . The French scientist Denis Papin ( 1647 ? 1712 ) made the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it his idea of cylinder and piston . It was to be for military purposes . The French military engineer Nicholas Joseph Cugnot ( 1725 ? 1804 ) , however , in 1769 was the first to put a self-propelled vehicle on a road ( Figure 9.11 ) , using a steam engine developed quite independently from those of Newcomen and later of Watt . Cugnot used Papin 's well-established ideas regarding piston , cylinder , and steam to operate above atmospheric pressure without the condensing feature of the British engines . As improved the next year , Cugnot 's vehicle was intended to be a gun tractor mounted on three wheels , with the power delivered straight to the single wheel in front . Thus he avoided the problem of the differential gear or other arrangement necessary to allow moving one wheel more slowly than the other when making a sharp turn . However , he suspended his boiler upon the front guide wheel instead of loading it within the carriage , which , of course , made the thing clumsy , top-heavy , and likely to tip over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his two cylinders were not equal to their task although they were 13 inches in diameter . They were expected to work under relatively high pressure and to deliver their power through pawls to ratchets on the front wheel ? one pushing while the other was withdrawing . This arrangement rapidly exhausted the pressure , and the tractor had to stop frequently to get up more steam . When running , it could move no faster than a man could walk , 4 miles an hour at best . It had no capacity for hauling a trailer ; artillery horses had not been replaced . Cugnot 's steam vehicle retired to the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers in Paris where it may still be seen . There was further experimenting in Britain in 1784 at Red ' h , CornSTEAM // wall . James Watt 's brilliant assistant , Scottish-born William Murdock ( 1754-1839 ) , constructed a working model a foot high with a spirit lamp to generate steam and tried it out on the path leading to the church . The fiery , hissing little monster came suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Watt considered making an engine which would move itself and had included the idea among his patents , but he pooh-poohed Murdock 's device so much , as was his habit regarding every high-pressure engine , that his young assistant seems to have been talked out of attempting to make it practical . Not so the Cornish strong man Richard Trevithick . For him , whatever James Watt believed was either to be refuted or excelled . Trevithick built a model in 1798 and developed it by 18oi into a fullsized steam locomotive engine with which he planned to carry passengers . Obtaining a patent on March 24 , 1802 , he shipped this engine by sea from Plymouth to London in 1803 and actually ran it in the streets . It was an adaptation of his noncondensing or puffing engine with a cylinder 5 %z inches in diameter and a piston stroke of 2 12 feet . It operated under 30 pounds pressure , making 50 strokes per minute . The three wheels were of wood , their tires wrought iron . There is no information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a significant event in the history of transportation was at hand if only Trevithick were to strive to bring it about . His imagination as an engineer , however , was- more forceful than his persistence . When his engine twisted its frame , he put it to stationary work , lost interest in steam locomotion on the highways , and turned his genius to developing a locomotive engine for the rails . Here too he pioneered , but turned away to other ideas which fascinated him before he had made his excellent plan practical . In the meantime , Oliver Evans , Trevithick 's American rival in creating the high-pressure engine , had also thought of his " steam waggons , " but like Trevithick , he was to accomplish far more with stationary power plants . The legislators of Pennsylvania were quite as much to blame as Evans for his having ceased work on road vehicles . They thought him insane when he asked for the rights of steam transportation on the roads of the state and they ignored his request . He worked with self-propulsion long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines into a wooden dredging scow on wheels ( Figure 9.12 ) . This he named Orukter Amphibolos , literally , the digger which works both ways . It trundled its 34,000 Or inure pounds 1 %2 miles up Market Street and several times around Centre Square , Philadelphia , in July , 1805 , before launching itself // upon the Schuylkill . There its paddle wheel took over and pushed it 16 miles to its dock on the Delaware . The Orukter Amphibolos was expected to dredge around the docks along the water front for the city 's Board of Health , but after three years of experimenting , the whole project was abandoned . The board had spent $4,800 on the " mud machine . " From the ease with which this strange device had moved up Market Street and circled the square , Evans drew the conclusion that " the engine was able to use any ascent allowed by law on turnpike roads , which is not more than 4 degrees , " 8 which would be just over 7 per cent . Nobody else seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles an hour . It is not easy to think of the contrivance as anything more than a historical curiosity , a forerunner , but in no sense an ancestor , of the automobile . With these developments and the contemporary success of the steam locomotive on rails , many sought in the next twenty years to build steampropelled vehicles for the public highways , especially in Britain where Telford , McAdam , and others were laying hard-surfaced roads through a thickly populated countryside ? the best roads for general traffic until recent times Outstanding among these engineers who put self-driven machines on the roads of Britain were Goldsworthy Gurney ( Figure 9.13 ) , Timothy Burstall , John Scott Russell , and Walter Hancock . Russell later became the builder of the steamship Great Eastern . Burstall competed with Stephenson in the trials of locomotive engines on rails at Rainhill . Gurney was noted for his research in chemistry , and his lectures on the subject had some influence upon Michael Faraday . As a child , Gurney ( 1793 ? 1875 ) had been deeply impressed in 1804 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public lecture in 1822 that " elementary power " could be used to propel carriages along the common roads . His views , as he recalled ten years later , were not then accepted either by practical engineers or by the scientists , who were sceptical , although their eminent colleague Humphry Davy ( 1778 ? 1829 ) was experimenting even then with the mechanical use of compressed carbon dioxide in place of steam . Gurney set out to prove them all mistaken and succeeded . By 1832 his steam coach was running on schedule four // times daily over the 6 or 7 miles between Gloucester and Cheltenham . Gurney 's engine weighed 2 tons . It had a water-tube boiler fired with coke to prevent smoke . It operated under pressures up to 70 pounds and attained a speed of 24 miles an hour . The wheels were 4 feet in diameter with iron tires nearly 4 inches broad . In 396 trips , it carried three thousand passengers without a serious accident , in less time than the horse-drawn stages and at one-half their fares . Similar carriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathaniel Ogle testified before a committee of Parliament that he was able to reach speeds between 30 and 35 miles an hour under fairly normal conditions of weather and road . Another operator claimed that his steam vehicle had run a mile in 70 seconds . Closer reading of his testimony reveals , however , that his course had been downhill , his brake had failed to hold , the engine had run away with itself and its load , which was hardly demonstrating the power of steam . Interests vested in the old method of travel opposed the new . Owners of horse-drawn stages made the outcry to have been expected of them . For apparently it was correct , as claimed by one operator , that the steam carriage could run 100 miles a day and replace as many as fifty horses . Farmers who raised oats joined in the clamor . Those who in all times are forever looking , and possibly hoping , for a good moan over catastrophe raised their voices too . These contrivances were not only uncomfortable , they were absolutely dangerous , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this world into the next . The facts were that there were frequent boiler failures with sudden loss of power . Injury from them , however , was remarkably slight because the boilers contained so little water . Sometimes the passengers did not even know of the failure until the vehicle had come to a stop . Explosions were few from the beginning , and loss of life attributable to them was small . Parliament , nevertheless , listened to the complaints , held hearings upon the dangers to peace and quiet , property rights , and damage to the public roads , passed legislation levying heavy taxes on road locomotives and making other restrictions . Finally it was required that a man on foot with a red flag had to precede each self-propelled vehicle on the public highways . The restrictions were not removed in Britain until 1896 . It was not , however , primarily the jealousy of horsemen and farmers that drove steam carriages from the roads of Britain in the 1840 s and kept them from the highways of America . ' There were differences between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon horse-drawn coaches , but these differences were hardly enough to force the steam carriages off the roads . It was the railway which brought misfortune to the predecessors of automobiles . In commenting upon the operation of steam carriages in Britain the American Railroad Journal of New York , June 30 , 1832 , had remarked , " It would be a little singular if steam carriages on common roads should treat Railroads with as little ceremony as Railroads are treating Canals . " It was not to be so . The rail companies like the farmers , horse owners , and turnpike companies , threw their weight into Parliament to exert pressure upon the lawmakers . More determining than restrictive legislation , however , was the fact that the railways developed high-speed service for both passengers and freight so well that the self-propelled carriers on the roads could not compete for the traffic with the carriers on rails . This triumph of railroading was before the coming of gasoline , production on assembly lines , reinforced concrete , and rubber . Locomotives on Rails As was mentioned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended principally on the development of compact , highpressure engines and boilers and the use of iron rails on roadbeds with slight gradients . The initial advances in the solution of these problems were made in England , where the steam engine had been invented and improved and where large-scale production of iron had first been achieved . Engineers had improved high-pressure boilers and engines for the road locomotives described in the previous section , but the solution to some of the fundamental problems of the railways was not attained until about the time that a ship first crossed the Atlantic entirely under steam power . Not until the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century was the iron industry able to supply adequate iron rails . By this time engineers realized that only an almost level roadbed would enable a locomotive to haul a trailing load heavy enough to be profitable . Within a relatively few years after the construction of the first railways , steam locomotives began to replace steamboats in inland transportation . Although there are still many inland steam vessels , the number of ton-miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried by railroads in most parts of the world . Richard Trevithick had made a trial with steam locomotion in February , 1804 , on the rails of a Welsh coal road , probably the very first time a steam locomotive engine ever ran on rails . His engine hauled io tons of iron , 70 men , and 5 trailing cars , 9 ? miles at 5 miles an hour , except when stopped to remove obstacles from the track . Later , in March , Trevithick wrote that he had tried the carriage with 25 tons of iron and had sent the steam from the exhaust into the stack above the damper as a matter of convenience . He took note , however , that it made the draft much stronger " by going up the chimney . " When this engine went off the track , he put it to stationary work , as he had ( lone with the steam carriage which he had demonstrated on the streets of London . Trevithick shipped a steam locomotive engine of 8 tons to London in r 8o8 and exhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence on a circular track ( Figure 9.14 ) . This was the engine acclaimed as the " racing steam horse " and as " the catch-me-who-can . " A passenger tinted it at 12 miles an hour , and Trevithick asserted that it could do 20 on a straightaway . Its cylinder was 14 ? inches in diameter and the piston stroke 4 feet . The engine ran off the track and overturned , and since // there had been few shillings spent to see it , it was not put back on the rails . Richard Trevithick has been credited by many with being the first to show that smooth wheels would adhere sufficiently to smooth rails on ordinary gradients , the first who used the steam jet in the smokestack for increased draft , and the first to couple the four wheels of an engine so that all of them were driving wheels . He did this coupling by means of gears . As the engine had but one cylinder , however , there was the danger of its sticking on dead center when it stopped . Trevithick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of these devices had to he coordinated and much more accomplished before the steam locomotive engine could be considered practical . It is useless to say that Richard Trevithick would have succeeded if he had tried . He turned to steam dredging and tunneling the Thames , improved his stationary engines , and in 1816 went to the mines of Peru where he remained until ousted by the revolution for independence from Spain . There is a story of his planning a railway in Central America from the Atlantic to the Pacific . During 1827 in Venezuela he met Robert Stephenson ( 1803-1859 ) , who also was mining in South America on behalf of himself and Britain . Those who know the political history of Britain in liberating the republics of Latin America will catch here a glimpse of more than antipathy for the misrule of the Spanish monarchy . As Trevithick was destitute , Stephenson supplied him with funds . Both returned home shortly , Stephenson to fame in railway and bridge building , Trevithick to scant attention and penury when he died in 1833 , although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blenkinsop ( 1783 ? 1831 ) had constructed in 1811 a locomotive engine with cogwheels on a rack . It could haul 94 tons at 3 y2 miles an hour on a level and climb a grade of over 5 per cent . As proposed by Matthew Murray of Leeds , this engine had two cylinders driving cranks at right angles so that it could not stop on a dead center ? an arrangement used in subsequent locomotive designing . Blenkinsop 's engine was capable of operating at a profit , but it was unsteady ; the strain upon the rack at one side pulled the rails apart , and the boiler finally blew up . Robert Stephenson 's father George ( 1781-1848 ) , self-educated engineman of the Killingworth Colliery in northeastern England , had observed the weaknesses in Blenkinsop 's engine . Stephenson decided that he could build a better " " Travelling Engine , " and before he finished he had made the co276 STEAM VESSELS AND LOCOMOTIVES ordinations and adjustments that were necessary to the technical efficiency and economic success of steam locomotion on rails . Stephenson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He named his first engine the Blucher , in honor of the Prussian general then campaigning with Wellington against Napoleon , and tried it out at Killingworth on July 25 , 1814 . It had two vertical cylinders set into the boiler , one for each pair of wheels . The cylinders were 8 inches in diameter with a 2-foot stroke . The pistons drove upward to crossheads from which the power was sent downward on both sides of the boiler through connecting rods to cranks fastened outside the wheels . The cranks were set at 90 degrees from one another to prevent the engine from stopping on dead center . The axles were connected by chains on sprockets so that all wheels , like Trevithick 's , operated together . Stephenson made his cylindrical boiler of wrought iron , 8 feet long and 2 feet 10 inches in diameter , with a single flue of 20 inches diameter running through it . As Trevithick had done earlier , he carried the exhaust steam to a nozzle in the smokestack where it induced a draft for the fire . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 4 miles an hour at the colliery . But it cost too much to operate . He had still to make a better " Travelling Engine . " Having built a second in 1815 without the success of which he was so confident , Stephenson by 1818 came to the conclusion that he needed to know more about the resistances his locomotive had to overcome . They were mainly three : first , the friction of the axles ; second , the " rolling resistance " or friction between the wheel and the rail ; and third , the force of gravity on grades . He constructed an instrument to measure the drag of the train against the pull of his engine and , with the assistance of Nicholas Wood ( 1795-1865 ) , made a most significant finding for railway builders . Friction was constant at all speeds . The resistance of a train of cars on straight-level track amounted to approximately i o pounds per long ton , but so slight a rise as 1 foot in 10o required an additional pull of 22.4 pounds per long ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gradient of i per cent would add more than twice as much resistance as on level track and thus require of the locomotive more than three times the tractive effort . Stephenson made it obvious that if a railway locomotive were to be successful it should operate upon grades as low as possible . This essential factor was not applied to the first railway which Stephenson began in 1822 to connect the coal field of Darlington with the port of Stockton-on- " Tees . Neither the funds nor the experience // of the promoters made a nearly level road possible . There were several inclined planes with stationary engines on the route , and in some sections horses were still used . The two locomotives , however , were marked improvements over his first . On the opening day , October 27 , 1825 , Locomotion No. t hauled a load of 90 tons made up of 36 small cars , about 600 passengers , and some freight at a speed of 12 miles an hour . Earlier in the year , Nicholas Wood , as he produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had committed himself to this judgment : " It is far from my wish to promulgate to the world that the ridiculous expectations , or rather professions , of the enthusiastic speculist will be realized , and that we shall see them travelling at the rate of 12 , 16 , 18 or 20 miles an hour : nothing could do more harm towards their adoption , or general improvement , than the promulgation of such nonsense . " When he published the second edition of his book in 1831 , he had to omit his pronouncement . The Stockton and Darlington Railway had drawn the attention of the world . Plans which had been germinating for some time in many places had taken form . A depression checked most of these in Britain but only for the moment . The economic value of a better connection between the textile city of Manchester and the port of Liverpool than Brindley 's Bridgewater Canal furnished was evident ; a survey for a horse tramway had been made in 1797 , another in 1822 , and now a third more direct route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer ; his son Robert built the locomotive and practically had charge of the construction of the roadbed . The young engineers whom he gathered about him at this time were to go on to other successes and fame of their own . The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was a decisive success , which its contemporary historian understood . " Speed ? dispatch ? distance ? are still relative terms , " he wrote , " hut their meaning has been totally changed within a few months . " " George Stephenson was able to disregard the cost and apply his principle that grades should be as low as possible . At the time of the opening , costs had mounted to twice original estimates , and later expenses increased the outlay considerably more . In one cut 2 miles long through rock at Olive Mount near Liverpool , the track in places was down 8o feet . Through the 1 i/ - mile tunnel near Liverpool the gradient was as much as 2.1 per cent , and at first the trains were hauled // up this incline by a stationary engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephenson 's engineering , which added to costs but deflated critics , was the laver of " hurdles , thickly interwoven with twisted heather , in a double layer with their ends overlapping , thus forming a floating road " 10 over the bog at Chat Moss where he carried the track straight across for nearly 5 miles . An arched viaduct became famous as the Sankey Viaduct , but it was the locomotive which George Stephenson and his son Robert produced for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway that put an end to all speculation as to whether a " Travelling Engine " on rails could replace horses . George Stephenson had persuaded the promoters to hold public trials and offer a prize of L500 for the best locomotive which should meet stipulated conditions with regard to weight , speed , and tractive power . Of the four engines entered in the contest , held during the historic week of October 6 to 14 , 1829 , two met with mechanical difficulties and the third was far too weak . Stephenson 's Rocket ( Figure 9.15 ) triumphed , meeting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carriage with 30 passengers from 25 to 30 miles an hour . In the Rocket were combined the features that are most essential to an efficient steam locomotive . Stephenson 's boiler was multitubular , equipped with 25 copper tubes , 3 inches in diameter , through which flowed the hot gases to the stack . It does not matter whether Stephenson learned this tubular arrangement from the French Marc Seguin ( 1786-1875 ) , or Seguin acquired the idea from him , or both developed it independently , as John Stevens in America seems to have done . It does matter that Stephenson used it in his Rocket and thus increased the thermal efficiency of his engine and more especially its capacity for making steam . The firebox at the rear end of the boiler was surrounded by water compartments , or water legs , to conserve the heat . This arrangement has not been essentially improved since Stephenson 's time . He sent the exhaust into the stack and brought the blast under control by a variable opening . According to their early biographer Samuel Smiles , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They still kept the cylinders inclined at an angle but connected the pistons directly with the pair of driving wheels . The Rocket with its tender weighed about 71/4 tons . Some twentieth-century steam locomotives with tenders weigh as much as 500 tons . After the victory of the Rocket , the Stcphensons modified the design of their engines somewhat . They placed the cylinders horizontal at the front end of the locomotive so that they drove directly backward to the main axle . The engineman 's control station was put at the rear of the boiler ; both he and the fireman could tend the fire and the controls . For many years , European locomotives were inside-connected ; that is , the connecting rods were fastened to cranks in the axles between the wheels . American engine makers started early to build outside-connected locomotives , with their connecting rods outside the driving wheels . Other changes followed , but it is fair to say that subsequent locomotives were for the most part merely improvements in detail upon the Rocket of George and Robert Stephenson . The improvement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated that locomotive engines were quite practical . Rails of a sort had been used underground in medieval mines , perhaps earlier . The first illustration of a four-wheeled cart on a track ( Figure 9.16 ) , published about 1519 , has been mentioned with the story of mining in Europe . It appears likely that German miners brought the idea to the collieries of Northumberland in Britain about 1600 ? not the last time that imported labor has made significant change in a country . Little imagination was required to extend the rails from the pit to the wharf on the nearest waterway , and none at all to load the cars with materials besides ore and coal . Horses dragged or pushed the " waggons . " The next improvement was to fasten iron strips to the wooden rails , and the next , to put iron tires on the wheels . These two improvements reduced the rolling resistance and prolonged the life of both cars and rails . Thus originated the private tramways of the nineteenth century . Among them was the 3-mile railway in Quincy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried granite from the quarry to the wharf for the Bunker Hill Monument , Minot 's Ledge Lighthouse , the Custom House of Boston , and other notable structures . This road was the best known , if not the first of such tramways , in the United States . The first railway chartered for the use of the public was built from the Thames River at London southward 8 miles to Croydon , today- the site of London 's first great airport . This was the Surrey Iron Road , opened in 1803 , later extended and maintained until 1846 . Its users paid tolls and owned or hired their conveyances . It amounted to little more than a plank road , although it followed the pattern of the tramways . It had rails set on crossties rather than close-laid hoards upon parallel beams or stringers . Plank roads of the latter construction were popular in early American and Canadian communities where the forests provided cheap timber and stone surfacing , for roads had not yet arrived . Though these plank roads were privately owned , they too were open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own conveyances . The problem of keeping the cars on the rails was solved before the locomotive engine made it necessary to do so . The device at first was a simple prong below the car , caught in a trough or groove between the rails . This device can be seen in Agricola 's De re metallica upon a miner 's t ruck of 1556 . The system has been used as late as the 1870s for a horset ranlway at Geneva , Switzerland . Just when the flanged wheel came is not n , but the idea had been fully matured by 1730 . Ralph Allen 's car to haul stone from his quarries down to the River Avon had deep flanges on its cast-iron wheels . They fitted closely upon edge rails of %11 ) xl . Flanges on the rails themselves were tried , both on the inside and on the outside of the rail , but their control of the car was manifestly 281 // inferior to the contact and restraint which were to be had with rail and flanged wheel . The origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel and axle . Certainly it is not as old , but experience with cross timbering in bridges , trestles , and wooden construction generally , since the days of Caesar , at least , was common . The earliest railways had wooden crosspieces . The use of stone blocks to support rails without crossties , which came into vogue with the first locomotive engines , was in reality an illadvised departure from a proven device . Ties not only were better to keep the rails from spreading ; they also were superior for the stability which the stone posts were intended to ensure . By 1838 , Nicholas Wood , Stephenson 's associate , was stressing the necessity of crossties where the ground was likely to settle . Rigid stone , steel , or concrete supports are often used today in terminals and at loading platforms where permanence is desired and the speed of trains is not to be considered , but such supports are too unyielding for high-speed railways . The strongest track today must have some elasticity , or rolling stock under any speed at all will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require some spring to the path upon which they travel . The question as to what should be the width of a railway caused in the 1840s and 1850s the " battle of the gauges " in Britain between the Stephensons and Isambard Kingdom Brunel ( 1806-1859 ) , builder of the Great Western Railway to the port of Bristol . The Stephensons thought that eventually all railways in Britain would become one system . Brunel visualized regional groups , such as did come later , which might vary with local conditions . He conceived of wider tracks , more powerful engines , heavier trains for the transport of the future . The Stephensons built for Brunel the locomotives with the 7-foot gauge which he desired , but they preferred to keep the approximate width of 4 feet 8% inches between the railheads , based on the traditional width between the wheels of carts . More than any other influence , their engines made this gauge standard . Many gauges have been tried , from 2 feet to 7 . The narrower gauges had many advocates on the score of economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hundreds of miles of both were built , but most of them have been changed to standard gauge . The Erie Railroad in the United States , for instance , used a 6-foot gauge until 1878 , but the Eric had more influence upon the fine art of manipulating the finances of railroads than upon their engineering . The Stephensons ' superior engines of standard gauge won the battle of the gauges in America.The desirabilSTEAM // ity of a uniform gauge became obvious as the town-to-town companies merged into interstate and international railroad systems . Only local interests such as the proprietors of transfer stage companies and lunch counters cared to have one gauge entering town and a different one leaving it . As soon as the Stephenson gauge became dominant , it was too late for any other to persist . The tread width of ancient carts of about 5 feet survived as the standard width of successors , which would have astounded the owners of those carts in every other respect . There are several unlikely theories as to the origins of the 4-foot 8%-inch gauge , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world as the Spaniards keep their 5-foot 6-inch gauge , Ireland its 5-foot 3-inch gauge , and the Russians move the rails in satellite countries to meet their own requirement of 5 feet . There are many narrow gauges as well as broad gauges throughout the world . The rail itself responded to the quickening demands of the steam locomotive . Wooden tramways had been overlaid with iron strips . Although likely to curl and break , they continued in use , especially in America , years after iron rails set on edge had been adopted in Britain . Rails like beams were made of cast iron at first in 1789 but given a deeper section in the middle of their span between ties in order to sustain heavier loads . From their appearance they were known as fish-belly rails . George Stephenson advised the use of edge rails on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1821 . " According to Gregory 's Mechanics , " he wrote , " rectangular beams the lateral strengths are conjointly as the breadths and squares of the depths . ' Hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantageous manner , viz. by increasing the depth . ' This was a fundamental observation of the greater strength to be had by taking advantage of the distribution of metal and using it in the height rather than the width of the rail . The next improvement was to eliminate as much as possible of the excess metal near the center , or neutral axis , of the cross section and to concentrate it at the top and the bottom , where the stresses of compression and tension are the greatest . This form came to be known generally as the T section . But Stephenson 's edge rails for the Stockton and Darlington Railway were not so designed ; they were rectangular in cross section , of wrought iron , 12 to 15 feet long , and weighed 28 pounds per yard . They rested in cast-iron supports , or chairs , which were pegged into stone blocks . // The next improvement was made by the American Robert L. Stevens ( 1787-1856 ) , son of the John Stevens ( 1749-1838 ) who had been prominent in the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Camden and Amboy Railroad ? on the original line of travel by rail between New York and Philadelphia and now part of the Pennsylvania Railroad ? had been instructed by his directors to study and report upon railroading in Britain . On the voyage abroad in 183o Stevens seems to have given much thought to the materials and types of rails . He decided against using the British iron edge rail set upon expensive chairs . When he arrived in England he placed with a firm in South Wales the first order for rolling T-section rails . They were wrought iron , 18 feet long , and weighed 36 pounds to the yard . Experimenting with miscellaneous cross sections on steam railroads ceased in America during the 1840s as the mills for rolling T rails began production . To Robert Stevens , therefore , goes the credit for establishing the principle of the rail section virtually as it is today on American railroads . Its dimensions have been enlarged ; some rails stand today 71/2 inches high upon a base 6 %2 inches broad , and their weight has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The material has been changed to steel carefully rolled and heat-treated to make it tough and long-lived . The British type designed by one of Stephenson 's engineers , Charles B. Vignoles , is double-headed or symmetrical top and bottom and supported in cast-iron chairs . Stevens 's T rails were set upon stone blocks . But wooden crossties , or sleepers , quickly proved superior and fixed the type of railroad track which has been laid since then . Practice in spacing the ties had varied , but it has become customary in the United States to place them 20 to 22 inches apart . The first ballasting amounted only to leveling and tamping the crossties with earth or sand , gravel , broken stone , or cinders , almost any material at hand along the way . The popular notion that broken-stone ballasting was made necessary by the greater weight and speed of modern trains is true as far as it goes , but it does not explain the whole problem of the roadbed . Ballast is necessary for holding the track in place and tocheck slipping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock of engine and train is carried through the network of rail and tie to the subsurface . As McAdam discovered in making his roads , a railroad has to be kept dry if it is to be firm . Modern track , therefore , is laid upon carefully graded and drained subsurfaces . Stone ballasting serves primarily to facilitate draining water away from the tics. // If railroad builders had their choice , every line would be straight as well as level , in accordance with George Stephenson 's analysis. , Each curve . on the early railroads was simply an arc of a circle . It was soon realized , however , that for smooth riding at any speed there should be at each end of each curve an easement or transition curve of gradually changing radius . Trains would then , with a minimum of jar , pass from the curve where the outer rail is superelevated above the inner in order to balance the centrifugal force to straight stretches , or tangents , where there is no superelevation . It was an English inventor who first observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rails . William Chapman ( 1749 ? 1832 ) patented in 1812 what is called a bogie by the British . The wheels of his swivel truck moved around the rail or circumference of the curve as the vehicle above it took the chord of the arc . The long granite columns for the new post office of Boston were hauled underslung between two four-wheel trucks in 1826 . The principle was the same as that in Chapman 's patent . Two-truck carriages may have been used for hauling timbers and other long objects in earlier times . British engineers did not at once take up Chapman 's idea , whether old or new , but American engineers did . John Bloomfield Jervis ( 1795- ' 885 ) , chief engineer of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company , who had received his early training on the Erie Canal , and his young assistant Horatio Allen ( 1802-1889 ) , who had come to engineering from the law , were among the first engineers in America to turn from canals to railroads . Their plan was to build a 17-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honesdale on the canal . Jervis drew up the specifications for the construction in England of the Stourbridge Lion , which Allen went abroad to purchase . As he piloted the newly imported engine on its 6-mile trial run , August 8 , 1829 , some two months before the famous Rainhill trials , Allen was the first in America to drive a locomotive . Its 8 tons , however , were too much for the wooden track with iron-capped rails ; its wheels were too rigid for the curves , one of which spanned Lackawaxen Creek on a frail 3o-foot-high wooden trestle . Allen got the Lion safely across at something less than 5 miles an hour , but the locomotive , after one more attempt on September 9 , was never operated again . The next year Horatio Allen became chief engineer of the South Carolina Railroad and supervised at the West Point Foundry in New York City the construction of its locomotive , Best Friend . During the sunnier of 1830 and 183 i he visited in Albany with Jervis , who had taken // charge of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canal , and together they discussed how they might design a locomotive which would have its weight distributed over more wheels without increasing its " action " upon the railway . Forty years later Jervis recalled that Allen 's idea had been to put two engines together and suspend one boiler between them on a " transom and pin . " How Allen would have assembled the cylinders , Jervis did not make clear . Both men knew that two cars had been connected and used to carry timbers at moderate speed . They knew also from Nicholas Wood 's writings that there had been experimenting with a similar engine having two fourwheeled frames with its boiler resting upon one of them . Jervis himself insisted that they should keep the driving wheels as well as the boiler on one truck . He placed his second truck , or swivel , under the front end simply to support and guide the engine into the curves . The result of their discussion and experimenting was that the system of two pairs of driving wheels and a two-axle , forward swivel truck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became common throughout the United States . Railways advanced generally after George Stephenson 's demonstration at Rainhill . Construction got under way with gradually settling political conditions in several European countries , even in France where Adolphe Thiers advised his King , Louis Philippe , that , however good for Britain , railways were not for France . Marc Seguin , as always , pressed to the fore and introduced steam locomotives on his Lyons ? St. Etienne Railway in 1831 . By 1842 the French government was planning nine lines , seven to radiate from Paris . Swift mobilization of military forces was the major factor in determining their location , but there was some thought of travel and business in other countries . The longest road was built to connect Paris with Rouen for the cross-channel trip to Britain . By 1835 Belgium appears to have had a railroad system on a small scale , built , owned , and run by the government . It was in shape an irregular cross centered upon Malines to provide railheads at the borders of neighboring countries , including Britain across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bavaria , opened in 1835 . Others connected Leipzig and Dresden , Munich and Augsburg , Berlin and Potsdam . They were designed for passengers rather than freight ; sonic were private enterprises , others were built by the states . There was no linking of the German railroads into a national system until after Bismarck 's time . Holland joined Amsterdam and Haarlem in 1839 , with an eventual // plan to import German coal and transship Spanish iron ore to German industries on the Rhine ; King Willem II financed and built the railway at his personal expense . Russia , Austria , Italy , and Spain also laid plans . Most of the early equipment and the contractors for these European projects were British , but American engineers were soon in the competition . The American George Washington Whistler , father of a more famous artist son , went to Russia in 1842 at the request of Czar Nicholas I to build the St. Petersburg-Moscow line . Like the Liverpool and Manchester in Britain , the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad was the experimental workshop , the experimental laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's engine Tom Thumb , in August , 183o , raced a horse , lost to the horse , but demonstrated the superiority of steam power . Here the use of privately owned conveyances was proved impracticable because of the lack of the company 's control over the vehicles . Here the railway was first extended from the usual river valleys , where grades were lowest , into mountainous country . Better traction was obtained by increasing weights upon driving wheels , and pusher locomotives overcame gradients as high as 4 per cent . Grade , rail , and tie designs were coordinated through experience to become the modern roadbed . By 1853 , twenty-five years after ground was broken at Baltimore for the little horse-drawn railway it started out to be , the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad , under the direction of two American engineers , first Jonathan Knight ( 1787 ? 1858 ) and later the younger Benjamin Henry Latrobe ( 1806 ? 1878 ) , had crossed the Appalachians to its then western terminus at Wheeling , Virginia , on the Ohio River . The European counterpart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1853 , on the plain line from Vienna to its seaport Trieste on the Adriatic . This bolder project crossed the Alps almost 3,000 feet above the sea through 15 tunnels and over 16 viaducts in a stretch of 33 miles . Other railroads in the United States raced the Baltimore &; Ohio toward the West . The Mohawk and Hudson and town-to-town companies in central New York paralleled the Erie Canal to complete a railroad line from New York City to Buffalo in 1851 . We have already referred in Chapter 7 to the canal system that formed in the 1830s a large proportion of the through route between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh , roughly following the line of the present Pennsylvania Railroad . The easterly 82 miles of this route , the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad finished in 1834 , was , like the canal , built by the state of Pennsylvania . The most spectacular feature of the Pennsylvania Canal was the 36-mile Portage // Railroad which carried its freight and passengers over the Allegheny Mountains through Blair 's Gap , 2,326 feet above the sea . David Stevenson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pennsylvania with the eye of a contemporary expert . His account , published in 1838 , praised the " mountain railway " for boldness in design and difficulty of execution ; not even " the passes of the Simplon and Mont Cenis , " he wrote , struck him as " more wonderful " works of engineering than the Allegheny Portage Road . The inclined planes appealed to Stevenson as the " most remarkable works which occur on this line . " ' 2 He notes also the goo-foot tunnel and the several bold viaducts . The railroad consisted of 11 level or nearly level stretches whose aggregate length was 32 miles , alternating with 10 inclined planes , totaling 4 miles . The total rise from Hollidaysburg to the summit level at Blair 's Gap was 1,400 feet ; from this point there was a descent of 1,171 feet down five planes and along five gentle gradients to the canal at Johnstown . The io inclined planes varied in length from 1,500 to 3,100 feet with gradients from 7 to 10 per cent . The line was double-tracked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars were pulled mainly by steam locomotives . The cars were handled on the inclined planes by endless hemp ropes 6 or 7 inches in circumference , passing around grooved wheels which rotated horizontally , controlled by brakes and moved by stationary steam engines of approximately 25 horsepower each . There were two of these engines at the head of each plane so that one could always he in use . Four cars , each with a 3 1/2-ton load , could be drawn up , and four let down at the same time . David Stevenson took note that in 1836 from April to October the Allegheny Portage Road carried 14,300 cars ? about loo a day . It could have transported more if it had been used twenty-four hours a day . The total freight handled during that period was 37,081 tons , and there had been 19,171 passengers . No comparison , of course , is to be made with traffic today on the Pennsylvania 's Horseshoe Curve . Stevenson 's journey from Hollidaysburg over the Portage Road to Johnstown lasted from nine in the morning to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . summit for dinner . The average speed seems thus to have been 5 miles an hour for the 36 miles . Stevenson 's whole " extraordinary journey " from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh took 91 hours of traveling time at 4.34 miles an hour . Of the total 395 miles , 118 were by railway and 277 on the // canal ; the journey cost Stevenson ? 3 . Today the Pennsylvania 's passenger trains make the trip in six hours or less . The fare . however , appears to be much the same . Charles Dickens should have come earlier to America for experience in perspective before making his very British commentary on the American scene . As he journeyed over Pennsylvania 's mountain railroad in 1842 , " It was very pretty , " he said , " traveling thus at a rapid pace along the heights of the mountain in a keen wind , to look down into a valley full of light and softness , catching glimpses . . . of scattered cabins ; children running to the doors ; dogs bursting out to hark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in their rude gardens , cows gazing upward with stupid indifference , men in their shirt sleeves looking on at their unfinished houses , planning out to-morrow 's work ; and we riding onward high above them , like a whirlwind . " ' Drivers on the high-speed motor road from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh today might enjoy their Dickens more if they could stop long enough for a detour of 25 miles and a look at the grades , curves , and 900-foot tunnel on the old Portage Road over which he passed . The Charleston and Hamburg , or South Carolina , for a brief moment the longest railroad in the world , started toward the Ohio Valley under the driving enthusiasm of Robert Y. Hayne . He died in 1839 and more conservative Southerners took possession . The project made Atlanta a railroad center and moved on to Chattanooga , but veered then toward Memphis , Tennessee , on the Mississippi to become an all-Southern route that could never compete with the railroads from New York and Pennyvlvania for the traffic of the Great Lakes and the Northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portage from Lake Michigan to the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers in 183o , had but 28,62o residents twenty years later . Enthusiasts , however , had built its first railroad westward to the lead mines of Galena in 1848 . The Michigan Central and the Michigan Southern came into Chicago from the Fast in 1852 . The Illinois Central began its service southward through the state to the Ohio River in the same year . By 186o , as the Pennsylvania system arrived from Pittsburgh and Cincinnati , the population of Chicago bad leaped to 100,000 . In ten years more it was 330,0(X) . Northern interests there were far stronger than Southern on the eve of the Civil War . Main streams of inland commerce had shifted from // north and south to east and west . The steamboats of the Mississippi and the Ohio , instruments of Southern penetration into the Northwest after 1811 , had lost the bulk of the produce to Northern railroads and the Erie Canal during the 1850s . The movement of wheat and flour alone is proof enough . The traffic had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico and those of the Atlantic seaboard . In 1852 , Northern lines of transit to the East had an advantage of five to two over the Mississippi riverway to New Orleans . By 1861 this Northern advantage had increased to 15 to 2 . Without a doubt railroads had much to do with the outcome of the Civil War . As the war approached , New Orleans remained a great port , almost equal to New York . In fact there was an absolute increase in traffic as cotton , an all-Southern product , swelled the total shipment from the lower Mississippi , but the relative loss to the Atlantic ports was heavy , and Southerners knew why . Northern enterprise had " rolled back the mighty tide of the Mississippi and its ten thousand tributary streams until their mouth , practically and commercially , is more at New York and Boston than at New Orleans . " 11 The city of steamboats must have its railroads , too , radiating into markets and sources of supply like those networks which were spreading about the Northern cities of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Steel Swiftly expanding railroad systems stimulated the rise of the steel in , industry soon after the middle of the nineteenth century . The later demand for steel for steamships and tall buildings further influenced the increase in steel production . A need for a new product often directly motivates men to development of it , but for two of the three most influential inventors of new steel processes such motivation was conspicuously lacking . Among the many men who contributed to the evolution of efficient and economical methods for the manufacture of steel on a large scale , the three most outstanding were the Englishman Henry Bessemer ( 1813-1898 ) , the German-born British-naturalized William Siemens ( 1823-883 ) , and a Londoner , Sidney Gilchrist Thomas ( 1850-1885 ) . Bessemer invented his converter in 1856 , Siemens 's brother Frederick patented a regenerative furnace in the same year , and Thomas patented his basic , or alkali , process in 1878 . It is interesting to note that none of these men was in the iron industry . The general need for steel was not the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventions . During the Crimean War , Bessemer had developed a heavy , elongated projectile which would rotate around its axis in flight , but the British War Department was not interested in it . Subsequently the French tested Bessemer 's projectile at Vincennes , and after a successful trial the commandant of the fortress remarked that the real question was , " Could any guns be made to stand such a heavy projectile ? " In his Autobiography Bessemer wrote , " ' I his simple observation was the spark which kindled one of the greatest industrial revolutions that the present century has to record , for it instantly forced on my attention the real difficulty of the situation , viz. : 29I // How were we to make a gun that would be strong enough to throw with safety these heavy elongated projectiles ? I well remember how , on my lonely journey back to Paris that cold December night , I inwardly resolved , if possible , to complete the work so satisfactorily begun , by producing a superior description of cast-iron that would stand the heavy strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In less than two years , Bessemer had invented and perfected his converter . Similarly in 1847 , William Siemens had no immediate interest in the production of steel for railroads when he invented his metallic respirator to conserve the heat in steam exhausted from a steam engine . The respirator was not successful , but William and his brother Frederick attempted to apply the principle of returning lost heat to various other processes . They invented the regenerative furnace in 1856 and subsequently substituted preheated gas for solid fuel . Although the first practical application of the Siemens furnace was for melting steel in 1857 , its principal uses during the next decade were in glass manufacture and the heating of air for blast furnaces . Not until about 1865 was the regenerative furnace first used to produce steel . Once Bessemer steel began to be available and reliable , the demands of the railroads for steel rails to replace wrought iron caused a rapid expansion of the new industry . The first Bessemer steel rails were rolled during either 1857 or 1858 . Although small Bessemer steel steamboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use steel extensively in ocean-going steamships until about 188o , despite Bessemer 's repeated urgings . The first Bessemer rolled beams were in the earliest of the skyscrapers , Chicago 's Home Insurance Building of 1884 . Although apparently the principal demands for steel were not the factors that led Bessemer and Siemens to initiate their important developments , there can be little doubt that these demands stimulated Thomas to work out his basic , or alkali , process in the 1870s . Steel is a solid solution of iron and carbon containing up to 1.7 per cent carbon , in contrast to pig iron or cast iron with its 2.5 to 4 per cent carbon . Wrought iron has a carbon content of normally less than o. l per cent , but it also contains 1 or 2 per cent of slag , which differentiates it from very soft steel . The ancients appear to have known of steel , as did the medieval smiths who hammered , reheated , and hammered again until // they produced the supple flashing swords of Toledo and Damascus and the tough steel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what is known as the cementation process . They heated the wrought iron , packed in contact with powdered charcoal , to a cherry-red heat for about ten days or two weeks . They next rolled or hammered , reheated , and again rolled or hammered the metal to bring about the absorption by the iron of a desired proportional content of carbon . Obviously , highly skilled workers were required to make steel in this way , and they could make only small quantities . Such steel was available only for special purposes at high cost . In addition to cementation , prior to Bessemer 's invention of his converter , there was one other principal steel-manufacturing technique . Working near Sheffield , England , Benjamin Huntsman developed the crucible process about 1740 ; he kept it secret for a number of years . Using blister steel , produced by cementation and having a high percentage of carbon on the surface and much less at the center , Huntsman melted his charge of about 35 pounds in a covered crucible for several hours . The resulting steel , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally hard . Because he cast it in molds , Huntsman called it cast steel . Obviously it was even more restricted in quantity and higher in cost than cementation steel , one form of which was the charge that went into the crucible . A few manufacturers still make crucible steel for special purposes , but the charge today usually consists of wrought iron and a carbonaceous material such as pellets of charcoal . Crucible steel is still expensive , selling sometimes for well over a dollar per pound . The Industry The prime significance of the Bessemer process was that it industrialized steel production . The cementation and crucible processes require highly skilled operators upon whose judgment rests the success of the processes . As Henry Bessemer put it when he made his first ingot , " we had as much metal as could be produced by two paddlers and their two assistants , ( irking arduously for hours with an expenditure of much fuel . We had obtained a pure , homogeneous 10-in. ingot as the result of thirty minutes blowing , ' wholly unaccompanied by skilled labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phosphorus-free Swedish pig iron that cost him only L7 per ton , Bessemer produced cast steel equivalent to steel currently selling for ? 50 to L6o per ton , by melting it and then blowing air through the molten mass . Bessemer was not the first to produce steel by blowing air through molten pig iron . Apparently trying to overcome the difficulties of a shortage of charcoal at his iron furnace near Eddyville , Kentucky , William Kelly ( 1811 ? 1888 ) first achieved success about 1847 in refining pig iron into steel by blowing air through it nine years before Bessemer made his announcement . Nevertheless , it was Bessemer who created the machinery for effective production . His converter ( Figure 10.1 ) consisted of a huge cylinder lined with brick and having an open conical top . Its double bottom made possible the holes through which jets of air could be forced into the molten pig iron to oxidize or burn and thus remove most of the carbon . The converter was mounted on trunnions so that the operators could tip it like a huge teakettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be rolled , forged , or pressed into any desired shape . During a single " blow " the converter could produce some zo tons of steel from cast iron in as many minutes . // Bessemer 's process , however , was so rapid that it was not reliable for producing steel except with a very low carbon content , the residual amount left after the blow has ended . Such steel is very soft , and it was difficult to leave just enough carbon in the charge to make a steel with greater tensile strength . Moreover , too much air would cause a " burnt " steel , overoxidized and brittle . Bessemer 's converter also could not remove such impurities as the sulfur and phosphorus that are present in many ores . In little more than a month after Bessemer announced his new process , in August , 1856 , Robert Forester Mushet ( 1811-1891 ) , English metallurgist and a competitor in steelmaking and invention , overcame the difficulty of producing steels containing the right amount of carbon . He added a specific amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molten charge after the completion of the blow . The manganese removed the excess oxygen , and the carbon in the spiegeleisen recarburized the steel to the desired percentage . Mushet produced high-carbon steel which could be hardened and was especially suitable for machine tools . Although William Siemens patented a process in 1868 for manufacturing steel from iron ore and pig iron in his regenerative furnace ( the so-called Siemens process , which was never much used ) , the French brothers Emile and Pierre Martin patented in 1865 a more important advance by producing steel in a Siemens furnace from steel scrap and pig iron . This Siemens-Martin process now produces about twenty times as much steel in the United States as does the Bessemer process . The essential feature of the Siemens-Martin procedure is William Siemens 's regenerative furnace patented in 1856 . This furnace consisted of two heating chambers made of brick grids through which , alternately , Siemens sent hot waste gases to raise the brick to a high temperature . He then preheated the incoming air for the furnace by sending it through one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the furnace large amounts of heat which otherwise would have been wasted . As used by the Martins , this additional heat further raised the temperature of the charge of pig iron , scrap steel , and limestone in the shallow container , or open hearth . During the eight to twelve hours required for the process , each furnace could produce upward of a hundred tons of steel from known quantities of materials ; the operators could make steel having accurate predetermined proportions of ingredients as indicated by samples taken from the furnace and analyzed from time to time , for , as is not the case with the Bessemer method , the reaction can be stopped at any point . However , // neither the Bessemer process as improved by Mushet nor the original Siemens-Martin process could remove the phosphates in pig iron manufactured from the highly phosphoric ores which are plentiful . A London police-court clerk , Sidney Gilchrist Thomas ( 1850-1885 ) , developed a process to remove phosphorus from pig iron in the Bessemer converter ; the Thomas process was later adapted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Birkbeck College , Thomas heard one of the lecturers say that whoever should discover how to manufacture steel from a phosphoric pig iron would make a fortune . In his spare time , Thomas immediately began reading technical and chemical literature and experimenting in a cellar laboratory . During the years i 871 to 1875 he devised the Thomas process which in its essentials consists of a furnace lining of basic or alkaline materials , chiefly dolomite . This material , a carbonate of lime and magnesium , absorbs phosphates from the charge . A flux is also added to form a slag which absorbs phosphates and other impurities and can be poured off . Thomas 's cousin , Percy Gilchrist , a chemist in an ironworks , tested the process . Thomas patented his method in 1878 , but steelmakers took little notice of it until in 1879 one of the Cleveland , England , ironworks using the highly phosphoric ores of that district demonstrated the benefits of the Thomas process . A considerable amount of the steel manufactured in the United States is alloy steel which owes its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the iron and carbon . Of the many alloys manufacturers produce , nickel steel , chrome steel , and chrome-nickel steel make up the largest total tonnage . Julius Baur , of Brooklyn , New York , obtained his first patent for chrome steel in 1865 . An abstract of his patent in the Scientific American for September 2 , 1865 , stated that he could combine iron with metallic chromium . He made his alloy either in crucibles or " by the pneumatic process " ; he could make " a triple compound of iron , carbon and chromium . " Some have discounted Baur 's claim because he gave too much credit to chromium and too little to carbon for the excellence of the alloy . His work , however , had an important effect on the industry , for it attracted the attention 3 of the French manufacturer H. A. Brustlein , who is usually credited with the development of chrome steel for engineering purposes . By 1874 chrome steel was going // into the arches of the Lads bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this time heat treatment of finished carbon steel was relatively simple . If a hard steel was desired for a cutting edge , the manufacturer heated the piece to a red heat and quenched it in a bath of water , oil , or some other material . However , this technique for producing a hard cutting edge also made the carbon steel brittle . If a more malleable product was required , the operator annealed the piece by allowing it to cool slowly after heating , and thereby he sacrificed hardness . Combined procedures could produce intermediate characteristics , but in general hardness was achieved at the expense of malleability and vice versa . In the twentieth century , metallurgists removed these limitations . As Siemens was building his experimental plant it , England at Birmingham in 1865 , Alexander Lyman Holley ( 1832 ? 1882 ) was manufacturing Bessemer steel in Troy , New Fork , and by 1867 steel rails were being rolled on commercial orders at the Cambria works in Johnstown , Pennsylvania . Abram S. Hewitt attended the Paris Exposition that year as United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once its significance , Hewitt obtained the rights to use it in the United States and built the first American open-hearth furnace of Trenton , New Jersey . Andrew Carnegie organized his company in 1870 at Pittsburgh . By 1873 the Bethlehem Iron Company was erecting a Bessemer steel plant with Holley as consulting engineer , who was urging all steelmakers to employ chemical analyses as well as physical tests of their products . Following the experiments of Thomas and Gilchrist in 1877 , the manufacture of basic steel spread rapidly , especially in Germany where ores containing phosphorus were plentiful . By 1887 the Krupp steel works had become the largest in the world , even though Krupp was unsuccessful in trying to evade Thomas 's patent . By 1865 the insistent demand for a material stronger than wrought iron , vet somewhat elastic , had brought about the production of 225,000 tons of steel in Great Britain , 98,000 tons in Germany , 41,000 in France , . and 14,000 in the United States . Bessemer 's first steel at L42 per ton was hardly cheap steel , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prices dropped fairly rapidly , and by 1881 the British were selling railroad rails for L6/10 o per ton . This price fell irregularly to a low of L3/I5 in 1895 . In this same year Great Britain produced nearly 31/2 million tons , Germany 4 million , Trance nearly 1 million , and the United States over // 6 million . In the thirty years , production had been multiplied by more than 37 . This rapid rise of the steel industry was one of the most important aspects of the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century . Moreover , without steel and its alloys the engineering advances described in subsequent chapters could not have occurred . Bridges of Steel Among the great ferrous bridges built with the spread of railroads during the last half of the nineteenth century , three were outstanding . In conception and design the three structures were distinct . James B. Fads chose the arch for his bridge , opened in 1874 , over the Mississippi River at St. Louis . For their famous Brooklyn Bridge , which was opened in 1883 , John A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of suspension with which they had been successful at Niagara . John Fowler and Benjamin Baker used cantilevers in their bridge of 1890 across the Firth of Forth in Scotland . All had experiences in common , especially with their underwater work , and all used steel . Moreover , all three bridges are still in use . One of the first to appreciate this newest form of building material was James Buchanan Eads ( 1820-1887 ) , born of Maryland stock in Lawrenceburg , Indiana , and builder of iron-clad gunboats for the Union government during the Civil War . Eads had steel with chrome in it tested by the British expert David Kirkaldy ( 1820-1897 ) even before Julius Baur had improved production methods . Fads was relentless with the manufacturers of the steel for his bridge until they delivered a product that met his requirements . As a salvager of sunken river craft before the war , Fads had walked the bed of the Mississippi in a diving bell of his own construction 65 feet under floodwaters and had felt the surging sands of the river about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-packed surface and scour gorges to great depths . He was sure that to withstand undermining the bridge piers had to go all the way down to bedrock . The people of St. Louis were eager to build Eads 's bridge . They were proud of their heritage from the fur-trading post of the French near the thoroughfares of the Missouri , upper Mississippi , and Ohio ; jealous for the future of St. Louis as the industrial city on the great river and the center of trade between Eastern states and the West as far as San Francisco . They were spurred too by the certainty that Chicago , across the state of Illinois at the head of Lake Michigan and in touch there with the traffic of the Great Lakes , would be the center of a network of railroads . " These might readily bridge the Mississippi above the Missouri and bypass St. Louis into the West . One , in fact , had already done so at Rock Island in 1855 . The Mississippi had served St. Louis in the past and had brought it wealth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block the city 's progress . The Mississippi was a barrier when its surface froze too thickly for riverboats and ferries yet remained too thin for wagons to cross . The ice jams were fearful when the rising waters of the Ohio or the Missouri or both swept into the valley before it had cleared with the spring thaw . The naturalist Audubon and his partner Rozier had been delayed more than a month opposite Cape Girardeau before they could Work their boat through the ice to Ste. Genevieve . The approach of the railroads across the streams and prairies of Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois , therefore , could mean but one thing to the people of St. Louis . The railroads must come straight over the Mississippi into their city . It was nonetheless the river that dictated the terms upon which James B. lads was permitted to construct the bridge ( Figure 10.2 ) . The swirling flood rose and fell with the seasons . Less usual conditions brought torrents as much as 40 feet above normal low water , increasing the speed ? ( flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capricious currents // in the channel that made a drawbridge inadvisable even if the river men had not opposed it . Spans would have to be long enough to give ample room for passing through without danger , and the clearance above high water great enough for the stacks of the river boats . Eads in 1868 planned his arches to rise about So feet above the flood level of 1844 , the highest on record to that time . Thev were also to exceed in length of span any previous arched structure . For Eads was acquainted with the judgment of Thomas Telford that a cast-iron arch of 600 feet could be thrown across the Thames and was counting upon the much greater strength and toughness of steel to make secure his own spans of Soo feet . There are steel arches today with spans of more than i , 600 feet . Steamboat men could not be satisfied . They wanted no bridge at all . It was bound to ruin the ferries and to create competition by rail with the river trade . Thev appealed to the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steamboat men , with stacks exceeding too feet in height ; there might be need for even higher stacks . Moreover , Eads 's arches were too long ; his piers were so far apart that pilots could not use them as guides . Fads demonstrated that top sections of the stacks could be lowered and that properly designed stacks not only offered less resistance to the wind than older types but obtained better draft . For the charge that his piers were too far apart , he had only the amused contempt which it deserved . As the bridge was nearing completion in 1873 , a board of army engineers agreed with the steamboat men that it should come down . But Secretary Belknap heard from higher up . President Grant had lived in St. Louis , and he knew James B. Fads . The bridge was completed . Anticipating the heaviest traffic for this bridge across the Mississippi , Fads designed a double-deck bridge to support as many people , he said , as could " stand together upon the carriage-way and foot-paths from end to end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway track below covered from end to end with locomotives . " ' Even then the bridge would not be taxed to one-sixth of its strength ; it would be capable of sustaining 28,972 tons uniformly distributed and of withstanding flood , ice , and tornado with a safety factor of 6 . To these ends , Fads made two decisions and clung to them against every discouragement , the obstructions of envious rivals , ignorant or acquisitive associates , the assaults of storm and river . He chose to build a bridge of three steel arches sprung from granite piers set more than Soo feet apart . Authorities said that such IRON AND STEEL 30I arches never had been built and therefore could not be built . He determined to set the foundations upon bedrock at depths which never before had been attempted . The results were revolutionary in bridgebuilding . Fads 's first intention had been to excavate within cofferdams . The abutment on the western shore was so constructed , going down 30 feet through sunken boats , wreckage , and general debris to bedrock . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking shape , Eads suffered from a severe cough and had to leave on a voyage to rest . While recuperating in France he thoroughly investigated the use of compressed air to keep water out of closed caissons , a technique European engineers had been employing for some time . He decided that their method , adapted to conditions in the Mississippi , would speed his work down through the sands and would prove less expensive . He had to learn from experience what would happen to his , men under increased pressures at such great depths . The revised method was to float an iron-shod wooden caisson ( Figure 10.3 ) of great strength into position behind icebreakers and protective piling and there to build the granite pier upon it while workmen within the caisson dug away the sand- so that its edges cut down to bedrock . Dads invented a high-pressure water pump to force the sand , gravel , and small stones up to barges on the surface . He placed his air locks at the bottom of the shaft to the caisson and within the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chamber could get close to them Without being themselves under increased air pressure . The caisson , or wooden box , provided for the construction of the east pier was in position October 17 , 1869 , and by November 17 it was on the sand . With crews working day and night , it had reached bedrock by February 28 , 1221/2 feet below the water level , a depth comparable to the height of a t o-story building . Meanwhile , operations had begun on the west pier , and by April its caisson was down 86 feet to bedrock . But all had not gone well ; twelve men on the east pier and one on the west pier had lost their lives . From previous experience with compressed air , the engineers had expected that too rapid release of the pressure would cause distress in the cars , pain particularly in the joints , and sometimes death . They knew that men working under compressed air felt the exhilaration of the additional oxygen , sweat profusely , and grew tired sooner than under normal conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work by burned fast under compressed air and that danger from fire was great , but they were not- prepared for the Hiuscular paralysis which made work- men stumble and stoop when the depth reached 65 feet where the pressure had to be raised to nearly 30 pounds to the square inch . The men resorted to galvanic arm and waist bands , rubbing oil externally , and doubtless alcohol internally . Eads and his family physician Dr. Jaminet were anxious . The working hours had been reduced when a foreman became ill . The shifts had been made 4 hours each with 8 hours of rest between . At 65 feet the working time was further shortened to a six-hour day , three shifts of two hours each , with rest periods of two hours . At the bedrock of the east pier , then under more than 90 feet of water where the pressure was 44 pounds above atmospheric pressure , the hard work of concreting began . With it came severe cases of the bends , or caisson disease , and in quick succession , three deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fell ill , climbed the long ( light of stairs in great pain , beIRON // came badly paralyzed and even deprived of his speech for a while , but he had learned much . Decompression was slowed down so that the workmen could not hurry through the air lock . They were compelled to rest thirty minutes after coming out of the chamber . Their great loss of body heat with subsiding pressure was counteracted in some degree by warm food and covering , and alcohol was strictly forbidden . The working period was reduced to one hour . Fads took further precautions when they came to building the abutment on the eastern shore , descending more than 135 feet below high water . Every workman had to rest a full hour after leaving the chamber . At 100 feet under , two working periods of forty-five minutes each were a day 's labor . There was but a single death on this abutment . That man had forgotten his lunch and had rushed home to eat ; moreover , he had stopped on the way back for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notable success in engineering . Compressedair safety laws of today have been drawn in large part from their conclusions . Their victory , however , was not complete enough at that time to save Washington A. Roebling from similar difficulties and personal injury in the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge . As significant as his underwater work were Eads 's steel arches leaping t he Mississippi in three great spans , each more than 500 feet . They were built as continuous arches , without hinges , four abreast , and held transversely by wrought-iron braces . The ribs or arch members were made of two 18-inch cylindrical tubes , one 12 feet above the other . Eads 's first assumption that the stresses in a parabolic arch would prove easier to calculate than those in the segment of a circular one did not survive the checking of his German-born assistant engineer Charles Pfeifer , and his mathematical adviser William Chauvenet ( 182o-187o ) , Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis , but the difference in favor of the circle was slight . The curves of the finished bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 6 inches at any point . With Chauvcnet 's expert assistance , Fads and his associate engineers had also calculated in advance the amount of expansion to be expected in the arches with temperatures ranging from 20 ? F below to 14i ? F above zero.The crown of the center arch , 520 feet in length , would rise 8 inches . he roadways of the Niagara Suspension Bridge , a span of 821 feet , which-John A. Roebling had built in 1851 to 1855 , had been found to rise and fall in cold and hot weather , 2 %4 feet at the center of the span , with no injury whatever to the bridge To obtain his cylindrical tubes , Eads handed six chrome-steel staves in an envelope , like the staves of a barrel , 18 inches in diameter and 12 feet long . There were 6,000 of these staves , carefully machined , each with ultimate strength of 120,000 pounds to the square inch and elastic limit of 50,000 pounds . The tubes were fitted with wrought-iron couplings , tested to 40,000 pounds to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed in the testing machines . Eads was so exacting that when his contractor , Andrew Carnegie , came to write his autobiography , he remembered the engineer as " an original genius minus scientific knowledge to guide his erratic ideas of things mechanical . " The editor of Engineering for October 10 , 1873 , had a different view . The alliance between the theorist and the practical man was complete , he said ; James B. Fads had used the " highest powers of modern analysis " to determine the stresses ; had taxed the resources of the manufacturer to the utmost in producing material and perfection of workmanship and had used the ingenuity of the builder to put the " unprecedented mass " into place . Once the materials for the tubes and couplings were past the testing machines and in production , the arches went up easily . As falsework in the river was out of the question , Fads used the system of temporary cantilevers ( Figure 10.4 ) which Thomas Telford had thought of using over the Menai Straits . Stays across towers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch ribs as they grew , section by section , first the upper and then the lower tube , simultaneously at each pier , for balance , with the cross-tying completed as they rose from skewbacks , or inclined surfaces of cast iron , set in the piers and abutments . The stays were held by jacks which were raised or lowered with changing temperatures . When complete the arches came under even stress and there was none upon the couplings except that of direct compression . The building out of the arches , though spectacular to watch from the shore , was relatively simple as engineering problems go , but there was a tense moment when the first arch rib arrived at the center . The last tubular section was just too long for the last space . The engineer on the job telegraphed to Fads for advice and strove meantime to solve the problem in his own way . He packed the tubes with tons of ice and hoped that the weather god would join his staff , but Fads 's reply solved the problem . He had devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthened to make the joint tight . The news that the arch was closed , it is said , encouraged the American banking house of Morgan in London to obtain more British pounds sterling for investment in the St. Louis Bridge . There was a tense moment when the first teamster crossed the roadway , another when General Sherman drove the last railroad spike , a third when 14 locomotives crossed two abreast and then in single line . Finally came the Fourth of July , 1874 , with President Grant to honor - Captain James B. Fads , who stood abashed before a high medallion of himself , with his bald head and his beard , hearing acclaim as one of the great engineers of all time . John August Roebling ( i 8o6 ? 1869 ) did not follow the reasoning which governed James B. Fads . When Roebling and his son Washington A. Roebling ( 1837 ? 1926 ) came to build the Brooklyn Bridge ( Figure 10.5 ) in 1869 , they thought of using steel as Fads was doing , but they conceded no superiority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been reasonably successful with a suspension bridge for the road and railroad across the gorge at Niagara . He was triumphing again with cables of wrought iron imported from Britain , supporting a highway wan of more than 1,000 feet across the Ohio River at Cincinnati . His skill with the suspended , or catenary , structure was established . There was in his mind no reason why they could not do as well with a span half again as long , more than 1 , S95 feet , from lower Manhattan to Long Island , high above the arm of the sea . The suspended roadway could be made rigid and held steady under every kind of traffic ; there would be a maximum clearance over the waterway for the masts of the ships , coastwise and ocean-going vessels constantly passing or docking along the East River . For Roebling , as for Fads , there was no difficulty with size except that of expense . The Roeblings paid little attention to Eads 's design for arches spanning the Mississippi where John Roebling had once proposed a suspension bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caissons , since the problem of setting foundations in the East River was similar . While the Roeblings did not have to take into account the turbulence of the Mississippi and its habit of plunging beneath its sands to bedrock , they did have to beware of tides that swept through from the Narrows to Hell Gate . They had to go deep for the footing of the towers for so great a span . Their caissons and piers were larger in every way , but the basic requirements of the construction varied little from those at St. Louis . John A. Roebling lost his life as the work began in 1869 . He was standing at the edge of the dock sighting across the river to line up the locations of the towers just as a ferryboat came in . It bumped the piling where he stood and crushed his foot . Tetanus developed and he died two weeks later on July 22 . Washington Roebling took charge to complete his father 's greatest project . Within a year and a half he too fell victim to // the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , he stayed in the air chamber from ten at night to five in the morning . Another experience with the bends in the New York caisson forced him in 1872 to give up active work altogether . At the age of thirty-five he was confined to a chair in the window where he watched the structure rise , unable to confer with his assistants but sending them instructions by his wife . After the experience in the Brooklyn caisson , Washington Roebling and his assistants made the wooden top of the New York caisson as fireresistant as possible with a sheathing of thin boiler plate . Lighting was a major problem . All open flames were especially dangerous in the compressed air of the caisson . Gaslights raised the temperature in the chamber unduly ; the compressed air deadened the sense of smell and made the odor of escaping gas hard to detect . Oil lamps were too smoky . Calcium lights gave fair general lighting but were expensive . Candles remained the best for close work . The sand hogs in the caissons of the 1870s had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready for the roadway when the bridge was finished in 1883 . The caisson on the Brooklyn shore came to rest some 44 feet below high water upon a conglomerate of clay , sand , and boulders that resisted picks , crow bars , andexplosives , like solid rock . The caisson on Manhattan Island , however , encountered quicksands and had to go down more than 78 feet to the underlying ledge where crags were leveled and crevices blocked with concrete so that the sands could not flow . Roebling had cautiously experimented with pistol shots and small explosions under the compressed air before venturing to use normal blasts . The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge rise 271 ' /z feet above mean high water . They were built of limestone and granite brought from Kingston on the Hudson , Lake Champlain , and Maine . At z66 feet , four saddle plates were set in each tower and upon these were placed wrought-iron rollers to support the grooved saddles which carried the cables over the towers . Thus there was to be no wear upon the cables as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving loads of the roadway transmitted through the cables to the saddles and so to the towers . Eyebars carried through the towers below the saddle plates were to hold the stays which reached downward and outward to the roadway , where they were attached at successive intervals of 15 feet for a distance of 150 feet on either side of the towers . These counterstays , with the aid of the trussing of the roadway , were expected to sustain the roadway which rose in a // slight arc . Together with these supports , the cables were to carry the weight of the bridge , the snow or ice load , and any traffic which might cross it . Roebling 's design of his roadway trusses and supporting cables , together with his massive masonry towers , prevented the excessive vibrations due to aerodynamic instability which developed in some later bridges . Distinctive features of the anchorage which Roebling patented were its wooden floors , anchor plates , evebars , and the curves of the anchor chains . The yellow pine floors were to be kept wet so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates were cast iron , weighing 23 tons each and measuring 16 by 17 %z feet , with radiating arms 2 %z feet from the center . Upon these rested the huge pile of masonry to offset any pull from the cables . The wrought-iron eyebars of the anchorage inclined upward through the masonry toward the cable ends in a curve which was designed so that the bars would bear downward upon the masonry and thus divert some of the stress from the straight pull upon the anchor plates . In each of the four cables of the Brooklyn Bridge there are 5,296 wires , a total of 21,184 wires . They were made of crucible steel about ' , / ; inch in diameter , drawn at the Haigh works in Brooklyn according to John Roebling 's specifications . Their tensile strength was to be 160,00 pounds to the square inch , several times as great as the load which Roebling expected ever to come upon the wire . The wires were laid or spun straight and bound closely ; they were not subject to torsion , shear , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends were threaded right-hand and left-hand , with corresponding threads in a coupling which drew the ends together . The joint , galvanized with melted zinc to prevent rusting in the threads , tested to better than 95 per cent of the tensile strength of the wire . To guard further against rust , three coats of oil mixed with resin and lead oxide were applied to the wire as it came from the factory . Then it was oiled again as it ran upon drums through a sheepskin held in a man 's hand . The two coats of oil could probably have been omitted since they did not stick well to galvanized wires ; most of it rubbed off before the wires were finally compressed into the cables . The precaution , nevertheless , was taken , and another coating of white lead and oil was applied to the wrapping wire . Constant watch has been kept ever since , and a stall of painters works continuously on the bridge . The Roebling engineers had the satisfaction and reassurance of finding the wrought-iron wires of the suspension bridge at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge was replaced by a steel atch , not because the cables failed , but because the bridge was not strong enough to carry the increasing loads of heavier locomotives and trains . With a footbridge laid on special cables and staved against air currents and storms and with cradles hung crosswise from.the footbridge on other wire ropes to regulate the cable laying , the long process went forward winter and summer in full view of ships and ferries beneath . No scaffolding blocked the waterway . A traveling sheave or wheel , 5 feet in diameter , passed from Brooklyn to New York , rolling out a loop of wire as another sheave returned empty to Brooklyn on the carrier . The first running time of 13 minutes eventually declined to about 10 minutes . The 278 lengths composing a strand were actually one continuous wire looped at both anchorages to make fastening with the anchor bars easy . Men in the cradles on stagings above the river and on the land spans brought each wire precisely into line with a guide wire which had been measured to the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagged they were clamped in a hand vise and gathered with lashings at 28-inch intervals into bundles of 278 wires each . New wrappings every to inches made these bundles or strands more compact , and then they were gathered into cables . There were 19 bundles , or strands , in each of the four main cables . As the lashings on the strands were removed and replaced by clamps , squeezers consolidated the more than five thousand wires , and wrapping machines bound them tightly with galvanized steel wire . A coat of white lead and oil immediately covered the completed cable ; the individual wires had already been protected as has been indicated . Twenty feet a day was good progress with the wrapping machine operated by three men . On sunny days the work Was speeded as much as to feet more . Each cable of the Brooklyn Bridge measures 153/4 inches in diameter . The combined ultimate strength of the four has been estimated at 18 million pounds . In comparison , Chaley 's four 5 ? - inch cables in the bridge at Freiburg , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The four 36-inch cables of the George Washington Bridge of 1931 have a strength of 18o million pounds . Builders before the Roeblings had used cables of wire for suspension bridges , but none had succeeded so well in reducing vibration and sway . John Roebling feared the winds and the impact of unbalance in the driving wheels of locomotives and the ambling rhythm of marching men even more . Ills able contemporary Charles Inlet ( 1810-1862 ) had lost three bridges because they had been too free to sway . For additional stiffness , the Roeblings drew their cables laterally out of line . The inside cables of the Brooklyn Bridge spread outward as they descend to the floor level . The outer cables draw inward toward the center of the span from the towers , and there are diagonal braces underneath the roadway , diverging from the towers to the sides of the roadway opposite those from which they spring ( Figure 10.6 ) . Injuries and deaths marred the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge . Lines fouled , derricks fell , loose boards and falling objects accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which took the lives of three men . Many of the men would not obey the rules about food , rest , and sleep , or report their illnesses , or avoid alcohol . The working day under compressed air was maintained at eight hours since the depths were not as great as at St. Louis and the men were never under pressures more than 34 pounds above atmosphere . IRON AND STEEL 31I The Roeblings had begun the Brooklyn Bridge during the rule of the notorious Tweed Ring which managed the affairs of New York City with a skill in graft that has seldom been excelled . The original plan was for the cities of Brooklyn and New York to ' buy stock in the company along with private investors . The opportunity for misuse of funds seemed great . Work was delayed for months as John Kelly , Comptroller of New York , refused to pay its share , and trustees for the company had to take their suit to the court of appeals . By special act of the state legislature , June 5 , 1874 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge at last progressed to completion . On May 24 , 1883 , President Arthur and his cabinet were present for the formal opening of the Brooklyn Bridge as were Grover Cleveland , Governor of the State of New York , and other dignitaries . Warming to the occasion , the orator , Abram S. Hewitt , declared that " the faith of th " e saint and the courage of the hero have been combined in the conception , the design , and the execution of this work . " Hewitt took note also that cities in the Middle Ages had " walled each other out " ; now men were " breaking down the barriers established by nature or created by man . " 5 It could no longer be claimed that one traveled by rail from Albany to New York in less time than it took during the winter to cross the ice " filled East River from Brooklyn to Manhattan , and the bridge had a very large share in consolidating and expanding the two cities into the metropolis of America . With its railways now replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Brooklyn Bridge carries a type of traffic very different from that planned for by John A. Roebling . He had set the pattern for the huge suspension bridges of today . Britain 's engineers were aware of the success which the Roeblings were having in America with suspension bridges , because the communication of engineering advances had been vastly improved . The Scientific American had carried British correspondence from the 1840s ; Britain 's learned societies were recording addresses and papers of members from other countries . The London journal Engineering , founded in 1866 , had become a clearinghouse for the profession throughout the world . Its special articles were reappearing on the Continent and in the United States . Reports from military and civilian imperialists overseas , on Chinese , Tibetan , Indian , and early Egyptian building , had long since been supplemented by news from America . It was well known that Finley , Pope , // Wernwag , and others there , as well as the Red Indians in the British Dominion of Canada , had ideas about suspension bridges and cantilevering . Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his successors kept informed . Many engineers prefer cantilever to suspension cables for railway bridges because of greater rigidity . None of the several railway suspension bridges built had been altogether satisfactory . Telford 's achievement at the Menai Straits in Wales had been overshadowed by the nearby tubular structure of Stephenson and Fairbairn . With all its shortcomings , the Britannia Bridge of 1850 had demonstrated the superiority of rigid structures in comparison with suspension bridges for railways . Prior to the construction of the Forth Bridge , one of the largest cantilever bridges was that which Charles Shaler Smith ( 1836-1886 ) had built over the deep gorge of the Kentucky River where John A. Roebling had raised towers for a suspension bridge . Speaking before the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1878 on the subject of long-span iron railroad bridges , the American engineer Thomas C. Clarke had declared that Smith 's bridge was one of the most bold and original in the United States and had placed it high among the engineering structures of the world . Smith had thrown three 375-f0ot spans across a canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended originally to build a continuous Whipple truss but had altered his plan to the extent of inserting hinges in the outer spans . The result was a combination of balanced trusses , or cantilevers . Following the tragic failure in 1879 , during a December gale , of a large part of the iron railway truss bridge across the Firth of Tay near Dundee in Scotland , the engineering firm of Fowler and Baker took over a site on the Firth of Forth near Edinburgh where work on a suspension bridge had already begun . John Fowler ( 1817 ? 1898 ) had distrusted the 2-mile-long Tay Bridge of 85 spans , then the longest bridge in the world , which had been opened for general traffic in 1878 , and had forbidden his family to go upon it . He remarked to James Nasmyth that the bridge might have stood if the designer had used for its tall piers the " straddle of Henry VIII " in Holbein 's portrait . Fowler and Baker determined in their proposed bridge for the Firth of Forth to make use of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had studied for several years ( Figure 10.7 ) . The adaptability of the principle to railway bridges of long span became more apparent as Bessemer made cheaper steel available that had the rigid strength to carry the rolling load of the trains which were to cross the bridge at full speed and to cope with the winds of the firth . The Forth Bridge engineers designed approaches of traditional short spans uniform in depth . There were 15 of these , counting both sides of the firth , approximately 168 feet each in addition to masonry arches . Then came the innovation . The two great spans reached 1,710 feet on either side of the Isle of Inchgarvie and weighed some 16,000 tons apiece . The anchor spans at the shoreward ends were each 675 feet long . The cantilevers with their central girders or suspended spans , assembled as a whole , constituted a giant 's stride in engineering ( Figure io.8 ) . The towers of the Forth Bridge , 330 feet high , were given a uniform lateral batter or inward slope so that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top to provide the straddle with which Fowler expected to reduce the stresses due to the wind upon the structure . The same batter was carried into the bays as they were also narrowed laterally . The central spans , simple trusses with curved upper chords joining the cantilevers , were 350 feet long and , like the rest of the bridge , wide enough to carry a double-track railway . Benjamin Baker ( 184o ? 19o7 ) operated upon the assumption that stresses caused by the winds were greater dangers to large bridges than the heaviest trains which could run on them . He experimented with models to determine the action of wind upon flat surfaces , curved sections , and cubes , and set gauges to take the record of the winds in the Firth of Forth . These came for the most part from the southwest and not from the North Sea as one might expect . The easterly gales scored from 15 to 20 pounds per square foot ; the westerlies up to more than 40 pounds , with the greatest pressures coming in gusts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of design . The sun also had to be taken into account . At the sliding ends of the suspended spans an expansion of 2 feet was anticipated , and the ends of the cantilevers were certain to move a foot . The only breaks were to be at these junctions of the cantilevers with the suspended spans , and so the whole structure would expand and contract with the cantilevers . The engineers solved the problem with an ingenious combination of ball and socket in a rocking post . What to do about the complex distortions occurring with direct sun on one side of the bridge and shade on the other was a different question . Fowler and Baker were confident that if they made provision for a margin of safety ( or ignorance ) in the strength of the materials over and above the requirements then known , they would have the strongest and stiffest as well as the biggest railway bridge in the world . Its margin of safety has been ample to this day . But an enormous number of unknown factors remain . Engineering still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Forth Bridge are of open-lattice construction . But the great steel columns under compression were built of cylindrical tubes , i % inches thick and as much as i 2 feet in diameter . Baker had given much time to investigating their construction and seems to have ruled out the rectangular tubes of Stephenson and Fairbairn . I le had then as precedents only the elliptical tubes in Brunet 's Saltash Bridge of 85y // and the cylindrical tubes in the Fads bridge of 1874 . Baker , like Eads , had realized the obvious fact that the hollow cylindrical form was the strongest , inch for inch and pound for pound . The steel was made by the Siemens-Martin , or open-hearth , process at Glasgow and at Swansea near Cardiff , Wales . Fowler and Baker expected the rolling load on the bridge to be 5 per cent of the dead weight of each of the long spans , or some 800 tons . To prevent tilting in case two trains happened upon one span at the same moment with no trains on the next span , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with counterpoises equal to the maximum train load plus one-half of the weight of the suspended span . The river bottom , consisting of whinstone or basaltic traprock and a hard boulder clay just as stubborn , was excellent for the foundations of the heavy structure . On the Fife shore , piers could be built within cofferdams offering few difficulties that were new to engineers . On the Isle of Inchgarvie and the southern shore , the foundations had to go down so far that pneumatic caissons were as necessary as at St. Louis and Brooklyn . Instead of the rectangular wooden boxes of Fads and Roebling , the Forth engineers used wrought-iron cylinders for their caissons . It was kept in mind that Washington Roebling had come near to disaster with fire in his caisson on the Brooklyn shore and that cylindrical caissons are more efficient under compression than any other shape . Once divers had leveled off the bottom , the caissons went down with few mishaps to their final locations , the deepest being 89 feet below high water . Their double skins were filled with concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the water pressure . The mud encountered was diluted with water , forced down one pipe into the air chamber and blown out through another pipe by the compressed air . The caisson was entirely filled with concrete after it reached its final location . The pressures in the air chambers were raised and lowered to balance the weight of the water as the tide rose and fell , but in no instance were the men obliged to work under more than 35 pounds to the square . inch above atmosphere . There was temporary paralysis on occasion but no death from the bends as there had been at Eads 's St. Louis Bridge , possibly because the depths were not so great . It is possible , too , that the physicians in charge took better care of their men because of the experiences of Dads and Roebling . The workmen of the Forth had a great advantage over the sand hogs under the Mississippi and the East River . Incandescent lamps Were a " great and lasting boon " in the air chambers . // Even the divers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc lamps with as much as 1,500 to 2,000 candlepower in the shops . The construction company installed steam engines and generators to supply its own electricity . Laborers came for the most part from neighboring Scottish villages and towns , though some were imported from Belgium and France . The problems of housing and transporting the workmen were much the same as anywhere else . There were special trains and paddle steamers to take them to and from their homes and so keep them out of nearby public houses . In all some 3,500 men were employed on the Forth Bridge , 900 working on the Isle of Inchgarvie at one time . As the Forth Bridge came into operation in 1890 John Fowler extolled the advances that had been made in comparison with the Britannia Bridge of but forty years past . Thanks to the achievements of Bessemer , Siemens , Thomas , and others , steel could now be produced at less cost than iron . If built of iron , said Fowler , the Forth Bridge would have both weighed and cost twice as much . Plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many in the Forth Bridge were as large as 30 by 5 feet . Fowler quoted the engineer of the Menai tubular bridge as having calculated that with the iron of 185o a bridge of the span of 1,710 feet " might be con- - structed " but " not an ounce of weight " must be put upon it or " a breath of air allowed to impinge against it . " Fowler added , " Each span of the Forth Bridge happens to be 1,710 feet . When tested by the Board of Trade inspectors , 1,83o tons were put on the 1,710 feet , but 4,000 tons might have been put on it without injuriously affecting the structure . " As for aesthetic qualities , the critic William Morris , given to comments on the art of living , declared that the Forth Bridge was the " supremest specimen of all ugliness . " However , Morris also stated that every improvement in machinery was uglier than the last and that there never would be an architecture in iron . Benjamin Baker replied to William Morris that beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be considered when determining its place in art . In a lecture before the Edinburgh Literary Institution on November 27 , 1889 , Baker explained why the underside of the Forth Bridge had not been made a true arc instead of a series of chords . To have done so , he said , would have " materialized a falsehood . " The Forth Bridge was not an arch and it said // so for itself . ' This statement may not have been a satisfactory answer to William Morris but it certainly was for the supporters 9f the new movement for " morality in architecture . " In spite of the experience with the St. Louis and the Brooklyn Bridges , the great bridge across the Firth of Forth marked in a way a transition in engineering practice in the use of steel in place of iron , particularly for structural purposes . Twenty years after steel had become available in quantity , builders had clung to the use of wrought iron . The lag was due in largest part , no doubt , to the fact that railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so inferior that steel quickly became a necessity . But even when steel was cheaper and prevalent , many engineers still preferred structural iron for its uniformity and proven capacity . By 890 , however , this conservatism had given way ; manufacturers were listing steel shapes for bridges and buildings in their handbooks , to the neglect of iron . Steel today is in general and virtually exclusive use for rails , girders , beams , and every sort of structural form , although wrought iron is preferred by some builders in such particular uses as pipes . For these , it is still thought by some to be the better material because it is less subject to corrosion than carbon steel . After Eads 's initial success with steel at St. Louis in 1874 , his friend William Sooy Smith ( 1830 ? 1916 ) completed an all-steel railroad bridge for the Chicago &; Alton across the Missouri River at Glasgow , Missouri , in 1879 . It was notable for its five spans of Whipple trusses , each 311 feet long , but although it remained in service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had started no trend toward steel trusses in bridge construction . Charles Shaler Smith attracted more attention in 1877 with his wrought-iron cantilever spans 375 feet long over the Kentucky River . French engineers were to gain even wider notice with their high wrought-iron viaducts . One of these , built for the Paris and Orleans Railway in the 1860s , was a single-track bridge extending over 1,000 feet in five trussed spans which were set upon clusters of cast-iron columns rising more than 181 feet above the Cere River . The Garabit Viaduct , designed by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel ( 1832 ? 1923 ) and completed in 1884 , was still more impressive with its parabolic central span of latticed construction , reaching 541 feet . Preceding the work of Fowler and Baker on the Forth , it was spread laterally to 66 feet at the spring line though but 20 figure at the top to give greater resistance to winds of the valley . The Garabit Viaduct soars over 400 feet above the Truyere River ( Figure 10.9 ) . Eiffel , noted also for the wrought-iron skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to determine how high metallic frames could be raised with safety . There had been serious talk of a 1,000-foot tower at the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia ; Eiffel made it a reality at Paris in 1889 ( Figure 10.1 o ) . Although Fowler and Baker were building in Scotland with steel , Eiffel preferred to use iron despite the fact that more metal would be required . Like Baker , Eiffel calculated the wind pressures that would come upon the tower at all heights and made certain that its design would be more than strong enough to withstand those pressures . The tower has a height of 984 feet ; with lightning conductor it rises above i , 000 feet . The most distinctive feature of the Eiffel Tower is its careful design . The structural members numbered 12,000 ; each required a special drawing , and all were finished at the shop and delivered ready to place . Of some 2,500,000 rivets , 800,000 were set by hand . The work , including the foundations , was completed in twenty-six months with so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Scientific American of June 15 , 1889 , applauded the achievement as " without error , without accident , and without delay . " The contrasts with another famous edifice in Paris have passing interest . Napoleon 's Arc de Triomphe , mimicking Roman tradition and the architecture of the past , proclaims a warrior 's success . The Fiffcl ' rower , heralding the buildings of the future , rises above the Champ de Mars ; the laboratory high in the lantern has front its origin been devoted to 3 t8 scientific research , first in astronomy , more recently in radio and radar . Neither of the two structures was planned to give economic return , but the Eiffel Tower has paid for itself in sightseers ' fees . High Buildings Alen have always yearned for the sky . Though varying their structures in form from ziggurat and pyramid to cathedral and skyscraper , t hey have expressed continuing ambition . The towering hotel and office buildings had begun to take shape before Gustave Eiffel raised his iron column . To achieve tall buildings there were combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until elevators were dec is ? d , the useful height of a structure was limited to the five stories or so that an average person could climb on stairs and still have breath left to speak of the business on which he had come . Also there was the very ; to // practical difficulty of raising walls beyond a certain level without having them fill the lower stories with inordinately thick masonry . A structural steel framework , supporting walls as well as floors , eliminated the need for bulky masonry walls . There had been hoisting machines since the time of Archimedes or before , but the Romans and their successors were not interested in improving the mechanism for daily use . They felt no great need , although the occupants of the Roman insulae , or apartment houses , might have enjoyed the service . It was not until railways hastened the congestion of urban centers that engineers put their minds really at work upon vertical lifts and made crowding in the cities worse . Freight elevators of a crude type were running in some New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydraulic , based on Pascal 's hydraulic principle . Capacities and speeds were low . James Bogardus ( 1800 ? 1874 ) , enthusiast in the use of cast iron , proposed to build a Soo-foot tower for the New York World 's Fair of 1853 that would be firmer the higher it rose and would have a steam elevator to take observers to the top . It was his fellow townsman Elisha Graves Otis ( 1811 ? 1861 ) who put into operation the first passenger elevator . Otis demonstrated his safety appliance at the New York fair of 1853 and in 1857 installed his elevatorin a five-story store at Broadway and Broome Street . An appliance to check the fall of the car came into play if the rope broke or the mechanism failed . By November , 1866 , the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia had taken note of an 11-story house in Paris that would have " a platform ascending noiselessly every minute , and raised by hydraulic power . " Sigfried Giedion states that the first passenger elevator in Paris was at the Exposition of 1867 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors besides safety that were essential . The first hydraulic elevators were of the simple-plunger type . Water pressure was applied by a pump to a vertical cylinder from the top of which extended through a stuffing box a vertical steel column or plunger which raised the elevator . Releasing the pressure allowed the elevator to descend . There was counterbalancing by means of cables or ropes so that the water pressure was not required to raise the entire weight of the elevator and its load . The plunger made necessary , however , a pit beneath the building as deep as the building was tall . With increasing stories , a different type was developed , the rope-geared hydraulic elevator which had multiple-grooved pulleys ; the motion of the car with respect to the piston was increased proportionally to the number of turns of the rope around the pulley . Gustave Eiffel 's hydraulic elevators of 1889 , like his lower , attracted the attention of the world . They were of three designs ; one by the American Otis ; the others were French . Together they formed system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform in three stages . The whole ascent took seven minutes ; some 2,350 passengers could he carried to the summit and returned to the ground in an hour . hydraulic elevators , while smooth-running and sure , are relatively slow . Close upon the invention of elevators came the idea that reversed the // practice of the builders of tall buildings and changed the primary function of walls . From earliest times walls had supported the framework and roofs of buildings , although medieval engineers had let the walls support only themselves as they enclosed the cathedrals . Now the frame was to carry the walls ; builders of tall structures were to rest their walls independently , a story at a time , upon a comprehensive framework , or skeleton , which was self-sustaining . The walls could be built story by story from the top of the building downward if desired , for they no longer supported the structure , they merely enclosed it . This reversal in practice was not instantaneous . In the 1880s many buildings equipped with elevators were still carried up far beyond five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these buildings still standing in 1955 is the Pulitzer ( New York World ) Building ( Figure io.11 ) , completed in 189o , with 14 stories . It represents the last of the type whose walls carry their own weight . At their base the exterior walls of the Pulitzer Building are more than 9 feet thick . In the 1850s James Bogardus of New York had come close to the skeleton or comprehensive framework without , however , seeming to realize it . His cast-iron frames , 70 feet high in some cases , had gained publicity in the Illustrated London News of April 12 , 1851 ( Figure io.12 ) , " before William Fairbairn had published his book on building with iron . Bogardus himself boasted that the greater part of his ironwork might be removed or destroyed and still the frame would remain firm . Together with his contemporary in Britain , Joseph Paxton , designer of the Crystal Palace of 1851 ( Figure 8.12 ) , Bogardus is to be credited with an architectural achievement in combining glass effectively with iron . His building in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a facade that was little but framed-glass windows . The glass was supported independently at each story , but the walls continued to support only themselves between cast-iron columns at each floor . Their weight was not carried down to the foundations by any skeleton . It can not be said that Bogardus had changed the function of the wall from support to enclosure . The French builder Jules Saulnier took the further step of constructing a skeleton frame building with curtain walls . The structure which he raised in 1871-1872 for the Menier chocolate works ( Figure i o. 13 ) at Noisiel-sur-Marne straddled the river on four stone piers to make use of the waterpower . The site may also have influenced Saulnier to adopt prat- tices that were already familiar in bridgebuilding , both with wood and with iron ; his diagonal bracing suggests this possibility . In any case the result was an iron skeleton which carried down to the piers the whole weight of the structure . The walls of hollow brick were no more than curtains . Though fully described in French journals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America at the time . The presumption has been that the discovery was independently made and applied to high structures in the United States . William LeBaron Jenney ( 1832-1907 ) is entitled to most of the credit for producing the first modern skyscraper , which he designed and built for the Home Insurance Company in Chicago in 1883 to 1885 ( Figure 14.1 ) . Carnegie , Phipps &; Cornpally asked permission to supply Bessemer steel girders instead of iron as the I Ionic Insurance Building reached its sixth floor . The steel girders subsequently used were the first delivery ever made of structural steel for buildings , in the modern commercial sense of the term . The third essential factor had come into the development of the skyscraper ? steel . With the elevator and the comprehensive framework or skeleton , there was now available this relatively light , strong , and cheap building material . A native of Fairhaven , Massachusetts , trained in Phillips Academy and the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard , Jenney was graduated from the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures of Paris in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago ; there Louis Sullivan , later famed for his architecture and his personality , worked as a young assistant in Jenney 's office and found him no architect , nor even " really , in his heart , an engineer at all , " but a " bon vivant , a gourmet , " who " knew his vintages , every one , and his sauces , every one . " The Empire State Building , the Chrysler Building , and other skyscrapers of today , whether in New York , Chicago , Dallas , Seattle , or Wichita , trace their ancestry to Jenney 's 10-story building of the Home Insurance Company of 1883-1885 , if not to Saulnier 's Menier chocolate works of 1871-1872. . // Until Saulnier constructed the chocolate works , the primary function of the walls of large buildings , as has been said , had been to support the building or at least themselves . For centuries , however , there had been wooden-frame houses in which the frame supported the house and the walls which were hung on the frame . Prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention of the balloon frame for houses , the wooden frame with its heavy posts , girts , beams , and braces was held together with mortise-and-tenon joints . Snow revolutionized frame construction by substituting for the heavy posts and beams with expensive and weakening joints thin wooden plates , or boards and studs held together by nails . Snow invented the balloon frame in Chicago , and the first building to have this type of construction was St. Mary 's Church put up in Chicago in 1833 . Balloon framing , used extensively in Chicago after 1833 , spread rapidly throughout the Middle West and West . The successful development of the balloon frame depended on the mass production of machine-made nails and improvements in sawmill machinery . In turn the manufacture of wire nails and cut nails of steel and iron depended on improvements of iron and steel metallurgy . The balloon frame industrialized house construction and made it possible for unskilled labor to replace the skilled carpenter . A balloon-frame house costs only 6o per cent as much as a mortise-and-tenon frame . Moreover , because skilled labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Writing in the New York Tribune of January 18 , 1855 , Solon Robinson stated , " If it had not been for the knowledge of the balloonframe , Chicago and San Francisco could never have arisen , as they did , from little villages to great cities in a single year . " 9 After the middle of the century the balloon frame was widely known as " Chicago construction . " In the 1890s , following Jenney 's construction of the Home Insurance Building , many skyscrapers with steel frames supporting them were built in Chicago . In fact it was the " Chicago school " which perfected skyscraper construction . By the end of the century , Chicago construction Meant a steel-frame skyscraper and not a balloon-frame house . It is significant that this term should apply to two types of framing . It seems quite possible that the balloon frame had some effect on the development of the steel frame . ELEVEN Electrical Engineering Three developments in nineteenth-century engineering have changed the ways of human life and altered the evolution of history . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapters 7 to 10 . The second was the emergence of civilian engineering as a profession , bringing realization of the importance of scientific and technical education as a prerequisite for engineering practice . The third and most important development , correlated to the second , was the introduction of a new method of approach to the achievement of engineering advances ? t he method of applied science . The subject of this chapter , the inception and growth of electrical engineering , is an outstanding example of this new and revolutionary method . Professional engineers , men who earned their living from the practice of engineering , had come into being in France during the seventeenth century . The French also established the earliest schools for instruction in engineering in the eighteenth century . The first civilian engineering school was the celebrated Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees ( School of Bridges and Highways ) of 1747 . However , the French institutions largely employed the apprenticeship method of instruction , and the teaching staff only occasionally gave general theoretical lectures . These schools ceased to function at the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later other schools , notably the rejuvinated Ecole des Ponts et Chaussees , the Ecole des Mines , and the Ecoles d ' arts et Metiers , superseded them . These schools initiated instruction in such basic sciences as mathematics , physics , and chemistry . In the early decades of the nineteenth century , Germany and one or two . other continental European countries established engineering schools 3-7 // modeled after the French . However , by 184o in the United States there were only two schools offering instruction in engineering , the Military Academy at West Point and the Rensselaer School at Troy . In the ten years following the passage of the Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862 , the objective of which was to stimulate the establishment of new technological schools by the granting of lands from the public domain , the number of such American schools jumped from 6 to 70 . In general , American schools up to tgoo adapted European educational techniques and " had little direct share in the advancement of the art . " American schools did not begin to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nineteenth century . The rapid rise of engineering science in the nineteenth century extensivelv altered the practice of engineering and lent considerable impetus to the evolution of technical education . Engineering science may be described broadly as abstract theories such as those of statics and dynamics together with the use of scientific methods to solve engineering problems . Once again it was the French in the eighteenth century who rapidly developed various aspects of engineering science . The rise of engineering science in the eighteenth century was typical of the Age of Reason , when scientific methods began to be used in the study of manyquestions , notably social problems . When it became obvious in the early nineteenth century that , for instance , a structure or mechanical device scientifically designed to carry maximum contemplated loads or perform a specific function and no more was more economical than one designed on the basis of " experience , " engineering science began to develop rapidly . It was also clear that technical schools were far more competent for giving instruction in the new science than was the age-old institution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of scientific techniques in engineering has been the application of ever-growing scientific knowledge to engineering . As A. N. Whitehead has put it , " The point is that professionalism has now been mated with progress . The 2 world is now faced with a self-evolving system , which it can not stop . " The phenomenal growth of electric power , which is hardly eighty years // old , and of electronics , a more recent development , demonstrates dramatically how rapidly an engineering field evolves when based largely on science . The invention of the method of applied science in the last half of the nineteenth century was one of the most important innovations in the history of engineering . History of Electricity Since from its very beginnings electrical engineering has been based on the science of electricity , it will he necessary to review the early development of man 's knowledge of electricity . Electricity is one of the youngest branches of physics . The Greeks knew that rubbed amber would attract straw , but subsequently the electrostatic attraction of the rubbed amber as confused for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Italian physician Geronimo Cardan ( 1501 ? 1576 ) differentiated these two types of attraction . In 1600 William Gilbert ( ca. 1544 ? 1603 ) , a court physician to Queen Elizabeth , published his De magnete in which he pointed out the difference between the attraction of amber and that of a lodestone . Amber attracts only small light bodies , not including iron , whereas a lodestone attracts iron only . Gilbert found that other substances than amber , such as glass , various gems , sulfur , hard sealing wax , and hard resin also exhibit a similar attraction when rubbed . The Greek word for amber is elektron , and Gilbert used the Latin word electrum . For other substances which behaved like amber he coined the word " electrica , " which is best translated " electrics . " It was in 1646 that Sir Thomas Browne ( 1605 ? 1682 ) first used the English word electricity . In 1629 an Italian Jesuit , Niccola Cabeo ( 1585 ? 1650 ) , made an important observation of electrical repulsion . Otto von Guericke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump , built the first electrical machine about 166o , although he seems not to have investigated the phenomena produced in terms of electricity but rather as a manifestation of the virtus conservativa , the attractive property of the earth and matter in , general . It was Francis Hauksbee ( d. 1713 ) in England who used a static electric machine with a spinning glass globe to conduct the first important electrical experiments . Hauksbee 's work stimulated the development of electrical science in the eighteenth century . Although ' von Gucrickc had observed electrical conduction , he apparently did not recognize it as such . In 1731 and 1732 Stephen Gray ( 1696 ? 1736 ) published papers in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society // which demonstrated that some substances were conductors of electricity and others were nonconductors , or insulators . Charles Francois de Cisternay du Fay ( 1698 ? 1739 ) of Paris , superintendent of gardens for Louis XV , constructed the first theory of electrical phenomena . After reading Gray 's papers in 1733 , du Fay immediately began to experiment with electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass stand and charged by a glass tube would repel other substances repelled by the tube but would attract those also attracted by a charged cylinder of " Gum Lack " ( gum-lac ) . Having investigated this phenomenon further , he wrote , " Chance has thrown in my way another Principle , . . . which casts a new Light on the Subject of Electricity . This Principle is , that there are two distinct Electricities , very different from one another ; one of which I call vitreous Electricity , and the other resinous Electricity . The first is that of Glass , Rock-Crystal , Precious Stones , Hair of Animals , Wool , and many other Bodies : The second is that of Amber , Copal , Gum-Lack , Silk , Thread , Paper , and a vast Number of other Substances . The Characteristick of these two Electricities is , that a Body of the vitreous Electricity , for Example , repels all such as are of the same Electricity ; and on the contrary , attracts all those of the resinous Electricity . " 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of vitreous and resinous electricity and that it was a characteristic of any one substance that it gives up only one kind of electricity when rubbed and becomes charged with the other electricity . Du Fay 's theory explained many electrical phenomena and was a useful concept . Its chief defect was that it did not account for the fact that the charge on any given body also depends on the substances used in rubbing . Two men working independently arrived at the principle of the electrical condenser . This is a device to hold a charge of static electricity by means of two conducting plates separated by a nonconducting material . Pieter van Musschenbroek ( 1692 ? 1761 ) of Leyden discovered what is now called the Leyden jar ? a glass bottle or jar coated inside and out with metallic surfaces separated by the nonconducting glass . Musschenbroek reported his discovery in a letter to Reaumur in Paris , who read it to the French Academy of Sciences in January of 1746 . In October , 1745 , Ewald Georg von Kleist ( 1700 ? 1748 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also discovered the principle of the Leyden jar , but his // reports were so inadequate that most of the scientists who read of them were unable to repeat his experiment . The first discharge Musschenbroek received from his " bottle " gave him such a powerful shock that he began his letter to Reaumur with the sentence , " I wish to tell you of a new but terrible experiment which I advise you never to attempt yourself . " Volta later gave this device the name condenser , because electricity at that time was ' regarded as an " imponderable fluid " which could therefore be " condensed . " It is now also called a capacitor . By the time the Leyden jar was only two years old , Benjamin Franklin ( 1706 ? 1790 ) had used it in experiments to demonstrate an important new theory of electrical phenomena . Franklin 's great contribution to electrical science was his one-fluid theory of electricity , which replaced du Fay 's two-fluid theory and , with important modifications , was useful and productive of new experiments for over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote , " We had for some time been of opinion , that the electrical fire was not created by friction , but collected , being really an element diffused among , and attracted by other matter , particularly by water and metals . " 5 When Franklin wrote this sentence he did not know about du Fay 's theory . Charles Augustin de Coulomb ( 1736-1806 ) , French civil engineer and physicist , made the next great advance when in 1785 he verified the inference made in 1766 by Joseph Priestley , English philosopher and chemist , that the force of either attraction or repulsion between two small spheres charged with electricity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them . Coulomb 's law was the first quantitative law in the history of electricity . Luigi Galvani ( 1737-1798 ) , professor at Bologna , found in 1786 that it dissected frog 's leg would twitch if touched with a scalpel while an electric machine in the same room was in operation ? hence one of the meanings of our word galvanize . After investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frog 's leg would convulse when he simultaneously touched a muscle and its connecting nerve with he ends of a metallic conductor , one-half of which was a rod of zinc and the other half a rod of copper . The frog 's leg would not convulse when the metallic conductor consisted of only one metal . Galvani was confronted with two possible interpretations of these interesting observa- // tions ; either the two conductors of different metals were producing electricity by contact and the frog 's leg was acting as an electrometer detecting the charge , or the nerve and muscle of the frog 's leg were producing the electricity with the rods serving as conductors . Unfortunately Galvani erroneously chose the second explanation and coined the term " animal electricity " when he published his paper in 1791 . The professor of physics at Pavia , Italy , Alessandro Volta ( 1745-1827 ) , at first accepted Galvani 's theory of animal electricity . However , in a series of experiments similar to Galvani 's , Volta found that he could not explain all of his results on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the electricity might be the contact between the two metals , he substituted for the dissected frog 's leg a sensitive electroscope , a device he had invented in 1 782 to indicate the presence of a minute charge of static electricity . With his electroscope he was able to detect an electric charge when two different metals were brought into contact without any frog 's legs or other biological material being involved . Pushing his investigations further , Volta discovered the principle of his pile , now called a primary electric battery , which he announced in 1800 . For the first time , with Volta 's introduction of the electric primary battery , a continuous flow of electric current was available . For electricalscience and subsequently for electrical engineering , Volta 's discovery of what we shall call current electricity as distinguished from static electricitv was of the utmost importance . The discoveries of electrical conduction , the condenser , or capacitor , and current electricity are the three most important eighteenth-century discoveries used in electrical engineering today . For some time before i 800 various investigators had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These investigations were in vain because there is no connection between static electricity and magnetism but only between an electric current and magnetism . In 182o a Copenhagen professor , Hans Christian Oersted ( 1777-1851 ) , first reported the existence of electromagnetism . Oersted found that an electric current passing through a wire suspended over and parallel to a magnetic compass needle caused the needle to swing out from the parallel position to a position almost at right angles to the direction of the wire . Oersted 's finding was a great stimulus to scientific activity . Within two weeks after it was announced to the French Academy , Andre-Marie Ampere ( 1775- ' 836 ) observed that a coil of wire acts as a magnet when a current flows // through it and that two such coils attract and repel each other just as do magnets but without the presence of an iron magnet . He must also be credited with having precisely defined electric potential or electric pressure as distinguished from electric current , in a paper published in 182o . By 1822 Ampere had firmly established by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what may be called electricity in motion . Meanwhile Michael Faraday ( 1791-1867 ) , an English chemist and physicist , had shown that a wire suspended with one end free to move and dipping into a bowl of mercury would revolve continuously around a permanent magnet supported in the mercury as long as the wire and the mercury were connected to opposite poles of an electric battery . This discovery of electricity producing motion was the fundamental discovery which eventually led to the invention of the electric motor . In 1826 Georg Simon Ohm ( 1787-1854 ) , a German school teacher , announced the fundamental law which now bears his name . His discovery was as important as Ampere 's distinction between electric potential and current and is equally indispensable in engineering . Ohm made many precise experiments before he was able to state that the amount of current in a circuit is directly proportional to the potential or pressure and inversely proportional to the resistance . Faraday was convinced that if electricity could produce magnetism , as Oersted had found , then magnetism could produce electricity . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetism for a half dozen years before he came upon the principle of induction in 1831 . It was in this year that he , for the first time , realized that a current was induced in a conductor while the intensity of a magnetic field was either increasing or decreasing or while the conductor was being moved in the magnetic field . Faraday also found that he could produce a current in one of two coils by moving the coils toward or away from each other while a current was flowing in the second coil . He then substituted a magnet for the coil carrying the current and produced the same effect . Using two coils wound on separate sections of a closed iron ring , with one coil connected to a galvanometer and the other to a battery , Faraday observed that when he completed the circuit to the second coil , the galvanometer needle jerked in one direction and then returnd to zero . When " he broke the battery circuit , the galvanometer jumped about the same distance in the opposite direction and again returned to zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotating a copper disk between magnetic poles he could generate direct current . It is on these discoveries that the mechanical production of electricity is based . Thus Michael Faraday had found not only the basic principle of the electric motor but also the basic principle of the generator and of the induction coil and transformer . However , Faraday must share the honors of discovery of induction with the American physicist Joseph Henry ( 1797-1878 ) . Priority clearly belongs to Faraday who was first to publish his results , in April , 1832 . Henry , working independently , had discovered induction before Faraday , but Henry did not publish his paper until later in 1832 . The discovery of induction completed the great findings which immediately followed Oersted 's detection of electromagnetism . The next important advance occurred in 1865 when Scottish-born James Clerk Maxwell ( 1831-1879 ) published a paper entitled " A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field . " In this work Maxwell presented his equations describing the phenomena which relate the electric conductivity , the dielectric constants , and the magnetic permeability of matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . One of Maxwell 's interesting conclusions drawn from his analyses was that an oscillatory or alternating electromagnetic disturbance would produce electromagnetic waves having the speed of light . There was little experimental evidence for this remarkable prediction , but in 1887 , Heinrich Rudolph Hertz ( 1857-1894 ) , young German physicist , announced that he had been able to produce and detect waves of " etheric force , " vibrating in an " all pervasive ether " and which had electromagnetic properties . Hertz had employed an " electrical oscillator " consisting of two metal balls separated by an air gap and connected with either terminal of an induction coil so that a spark would jump between the balls . His detector was a piece of wire about 7 feet long with a small metal ball at each end . Hertz bent the wire into a ring and varied the distance between the balls . When he achieved the proper distance , a spark would jump the gap in the detector when the oscillator sparked . Hertz was able to show that these new waves ( hertzian waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as light and radiant heat waves are . Later Hertz calculated that the speed of his electromagnetic waves was the same as that of light and thus confirmed Maxwell 's prediction . Hertzian waves are now known as radio waves or wireless waves . Radio and television transmission are directly based on a knowledge of the // properties of the waves which Hertz discovered in 1887 and the existence of which Maxwell had predicted nearly two decades earlier . While these advances were being made in the knowledge of electromagnetic waves , two other avenues of research were opening which were to produce important information for subsequent application in radio or wireless and television . One line of research was on cathode rays , rays projected from the cathode or negative terminal of a vacuum tube through which a current is flowing . Julius Plucker ( 1801 ? 1868 ) of the University of Bonn discovered cathode rays in 1859 . The other line of research was on the so-called " Edison effect " discovered in 1883 by Thomas Alva Edison ( 1847-1931 ) . Ten years after Plucker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1824 ? 1914 ) showed that these rays were propagated in straight lines and that a magnetic field at right angles to the line of discharge would deflect the rays . By 1879 William Crookes ( 1832 ? 1919 ) , English physicist and chemist , had shown that cathode rays had momentum and also definite energy . In 1897 the English physicist Joseph John Thomson ( 1856 ? 1940 ) demonstrated conclusively that cathode rays are negatively charged atomlike particles which he called " corpuscles " and which are now called electrons . Thomson 's discovery of the electron was the first physical evidence that such particles exist in nature , and together with the discovery by Antoine Henri Becquerel ( 1852 ? 1908 ) of radioactivity in the previous year , 1896 , forms the starting point for the remarkable development during the twentieth century of the science of atomic physics . Thomson 's discovery made it possible for him to explain what was known as the Edison effect . Edison had found that a small current would pass from the carbon filament of his then newly invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electrode sealed into the bulb when the electrode was charged positively . No current would flow when the electrode was charged negatively . Two British investigators , William Henry Preece ( 1834 ? 1913 ) in 1885 and John Ambrose Fleming 1849-1945 ) in 1890 and 1896 , had studied the Edison effect in great detail . In 1903 , Thomson proved that electrons were the carriers of the current observed in the Edison effect . Application of this knowledge has been of great importance in the field of electronics . The radio tube or electric valve is an/application of this phenomenon fundamental to communications engineering . In the following sections of this chapter we shall discuss how knowledge of electricity has been used to establish electrical engineering , in336 ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING eluding communication and power production and utilization . The first important practical application chronologically was the electromagnetic telegraph . Telecommunication During the first thirty to forty centuries after man began to live in villages , roughly seventy-five centuries ago , he began to extend political control over groups of villages and later cities and to carry on trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls and commerce beyond the limits of the local village , he has had need to communicate messages over considerable distances . Until the nineteenth century men transmitted messages by signal fires , smoke , drums , runners , pigeons , ships , postriders , and by sentinels who relayed shouted messages . Indeed , primitive tribes still use some of these techniques . Our word marathon derives from the Marathon Plain , 26 miles outside the city of Athens . In 490 B.C. , the Persians invaded the Greek Peninsula , and the Athenians attacked and defeated them on the Marathon Plain . A young Athenian , Pheidippides , ran the 26 miles to Athens bringing the news that the Athenians were victorious . In the sixteenth century , Europeans literally explored the world . The colonization which followed their explorations brought about an enormous extension of known distances and greatly increased the volume of commerce . These developments in turn produced more urgent requirements for the rapid communication of messages . Several men proposed optical telegraphs in the seventeenth century ; Robert Hooke 's is perhaps the best known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many recommendations for the use of static electricity to communicate messages . None , however , was practicable . In 1794 , Claude Chappe ( 1763-I805 ) developed what he called an ocular , or semaphore , telegraph ( Figure 11.1 ) , which was the first practical device . His system consisted of a line of towers 6 to to miles apart . The operator at each tower , usually using a telescope , could see the tower on either side of him in the line if visibility was good . On the top of each tower was a semaphore consisting of a wooden beam pivoted midway so that it could be rotated in a vertical plane . In addition there were movable arms at each end of the beam . It appears that the speed of transmission could be fairly rapid . For instance , over the 475-mile line with its 120 towers between Paris and Toulon , it is said that the operators were able to transmit a message in ten to twelve minutes . The Drench government operated the first Chappe telegraph between Paris and Lille , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and use of the system spread rapidly . The British subsequently built several Chappe lines connecting London with various channel ports where it was feared that Napoleon 's fleet might land . In 1 Soo Jonathan Grout built the first semaphoric telegraph line in the United States . This 65-mile line connected Martha 's Vineyard with Boston and was built to transmit commercial news , especially of the arrival of ships . Although some of the Chappe telegraphs were still in operation at the middle of the nineteenth century , the semaphore system was expensive to operate since it required men to he stationed at every tower and was dependent upon clear weather . Volta 's invention of the electric battery in ' Soo stimulated efforts to develop an electric telegraph . Following Oersted 's discovery of electromagnetism , /William Sturgeon ( 1783-1850 ) , English physicist , constructed an electromagnet about 1825 , and the next year Ohm announced his law concerning the flow ' of an electric current in a circuit . These discoveries were essential for the development of practical electromagnetic telegraphy . The demand for rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally dozens of men trying to produce an electrical telegraph . In 182o Ampere had suggested that by using a circuit for each letter and a magnetic needle at the terminal it would be possible to transmit messages . One of the first practical electromagnetic telegraph systems was based on Ampere 's idea . Ten years later William Ritchie demonstrated Ampere 's proposal on a small scale . In 1832 Paul von SchillingCannstadt ( 1786 ? 1837 ) , a native of Estonia , worked out a system also based on Ampere 's suggestion , but he never produced a practical telegraph . In 1836 a young Englishman , William Fothergill Cooke ( 1806 ? 1879 ) , saw some electromagnetic experiments in Heidelberg where he was studying anatomy . He was immediately impressed with the possibilities of using an electric current for the operation of a telegraph . Within three weeks he had put together his first instrument ; it was the magnetic-needle type and similar to Schilling 's device . After Cooke 's return to England , Faraday introduced him to Charles Wheatstone ( 18o2 ? 1875 ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important work on an electric telegraph . Later , in 1837 , the two formed a partnership . Before they had signed the partnership agreement , Cooke and Wheatstone had constructed in 1837 a telegraph line along the London and Birmingham Railway north from Euston Station , London , about a mile to Camden Town , and successfully transmitted their first messages . The early instruments of Cooke and Wheatstone required five or six wires for transmission and correspondingly five or six magnetic needles , each pivoted between the two sections of a double wire coil . The needles swung to right or left and indicated specific letters , depending on the sender 's setting of a dial . By arrangement with the incompleted Great Western Railway , the partners established a telegraph line along the railway out of Paddington Station and in 1839 extended it 71/ miles to Hanwell . By 1843 this line reached Slough , 18 %z miles from Paddington . Their telegraph system received considerable publicity when the news of the birth of Queen Victoria 's second son was transmitted over it on August 6 , 1844 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a charge of a shilling for admission to the office to see it work . However , the part the telegraph played in the capture of a murderer brought the system its greatest publicity . On New Year 's Day , 845 , a Londoner named John Tawell took the train to Slough where he gave a woman a fatal dose of poison . Realizing she had been poisoned , the unfortunate victim began to scream . This screaming aroused the neighbors , and Tawell , alarmed , rushed to the station and inmlcdiatclvv boarded a train // for London . Someone who had seen him leave the house described him to the telegraph operator who at once wired the news to the Paddington Station , adding that the murderer was on the train which had just left Slough and that he was dressed like a " Kwaker " ? there was no " Q " in the Cooke and Wheatstone system at that time . The Paddington operator notified a railroad detective , who spotted Tawell as he left the train and trailed him to his home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tawell was arrested . He was subsequently tried and hanged . The Slough murder case proved an excellent advertisement for telegraphy . While Cooke and Wheatstone were developing their telegraph system which became standard in England , Samuel Finley Breese Morse ( 1791-1872 ) , an American artist , was perfecting a different type of electromagnetic telegraph . Returning to the United States in 1832 after a three-year stay in Europe , Morse discussed various problems of electromagnetism with a fellow passenger , Dr. C. T. Jackson of Boston , Massachusetts , who apparently told Morse about various experimental electric telegraphs in Europe . Jackson later claimed to be the originator of the idea of the electromagnetic telegraph . This claim is of questionable validity , but there can be little doubt that Jackson was a man with useful ideas . It was he who more than ten years later suggested to Dr. W. T. G. Morton the use of ether as an anesthetic and then claimed a share in that great discovery . He also claimed in 1846 that he had given Christian Friedrich Schonbein the idea he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York in the autumn of 1832 , he immediately set to work on a telegraph , but it was not until 1836 that he completed his first instrument . Shortly thereafter he learned from his colleague Leonard D. Gale of the University of the City of New York about Joseph Henry 's improved electromagnets wound with many turns of insulated wire . Morse found that the new magnet would greatly increase the distance over which he could transmit a signal . Morse 's receiver at that time was a pen in constant contact with a strip of paper moved by a dock mechanism . When the electromagnet was energized , it moved the pen so that it traced a notch on the paper . Morse formulated messages by varving the time intervals between the notches or by inverting them by reversing the polarity or direction of flow of the sending current of the signal . On/ September 4 , 1837 , the same year that Cooke and Wheatstone first Operated their I ? uston Station to Camden " Town telegraph , Morse transmitted his first message through 1,700 feet of wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // he developed a relay to increase the practicable distance of transmission of messages . In this device the signal activated an electromagnet which closed a contact in a local battery circuit , thereby transmitting the signal to the next relay by means of this second battery circuit . This process could be repeated indefinitely . Curiously , Henry and Wheatstone were developing similar relays at the same time . Morse 's second improvement was the widely used dot-and-dash code system and the sounder suggested by his younger colleague Alfred Vail ( 1807-1859 ) , which greatly facilitated the reading of messages . In this scheme , the operator completes the circuit by closing the sounding key , and the sounding device attached to an electromagnet moves with an audible click . This dot is a very short signal of only a fraction of a second duration , and the dash is about three times as long . Morse was able to obtain some private financial support , but his efforts to get a grant from the United States Congress were unsuccessful until January , 1843 , when Congress appropriated $30,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ohio Railroad between Baltimore and Washington . On May 24 , 1844 , the first message ? " What bath God wrought " ? was transmitted from Washington to Baltimore over this line , and the Morse system of telegraphy was established . After this success , other lines were rapidly built . By 1846 , telegraph lines stretched from Washington to Portland , Maine , and westward to Louisville , Kentucky , and Milwaukee , Wisconsin . The development of duplex , quadruplex , and multiplex telegraphy many years later has greatly increased the economy of transmission . The multiplex system enables operators to transmit messages simultaneously over the same set of wires , and perforated tape devices permit far higher speeds than are possible with manual key operation . Short lengths of cable were laid under rivers as some of the earliest telegraph lines were strung . One of the first cables was that under the harbor at New York by Morse ; it was insulated with gutta-percha , a rubberlike substance discovered in 1834 . The first submarine cable of considerable length , from Dover to Calais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cable proving inadequate , a greatly improved cable was opened for service in November , 1851 , and gave satisfactory service for many years . In the next few years a cable connected Denmark and Sweden , and cables were laid in the Mediterranean Sea . The first successful Atlantic cable began operation in 1866 , largely // owing to the efforts of Cyrus West Field ( 1819-1892 ) , after many tragic failures . The Atlantic Telegraph Company had been organized in 1856 , and the first attempt to lay a cable between Ireland and Newfoundland was made the following year . This cable broke after 335 miles had been laid , owing to an accident in the paying-out machinery . A second attempt in June , 1858 , similarly piled , but later in the summer of that year the company completed , on August 5 , the laving of a cable . The " first " commercial message was sent on August 17 after a congratulatory message from Queen Victoria to President Buchanan . This cable remained in operation only a short while for it gradually failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messages transmitted while the cable was still in service was a communication from the British government to Canada , peace having been concluded with China , countermanding an order for the departure of two regiments of soldiers which were about to return to England for service in India . If the cable had not been in operation at that time the regiments would have sailed and considerable unnecessary expense ( estimated at ? 50,000 ) would have been incurred . During the next seven years a group of scientists and engineers worked for the Atlantic Telegraph Company to improve the insulation and mechanical strength of the cable , the paying-out apparatus , the receiving mechanism , and the type of signals to be used . Sir William Thomson ( Lord Kelvin , 1824-1907 ) , professor of natural science at Glasgow , was largely responsible for the ultimate success of the cable . The com . pany ' secured the Great Eastern for the next attempt , which began at Valencia , Ireland , on July 23 , 1865 . After 1,200 miles had been payed out , the cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles ) of water , and the project was abandoned for that year . The Atlantic Company failed and was succeeded by the Anglo-American Company , which continued the project . On July 13 , 1866 , the Great Eastern again steamed west from Valencia with a new cable which was landed at Newfoundland on July 27 . The Great Eastern then conducted a successful search for the cable which had parted the previous year . A new cable was spliced to the recovered end , and the second landing was made at Newfoundland on September 8 . Cables have been in continuous service ever since ; ninecables now cross the Atlantic . In the summer of 1955 , HMTS Monarch was laving a new type of transatlantic cable , a coaxial cable ' Rh a-repeater employing three vacuum tubes every 40 miles , for transmitting telephone messages in one direction . After a second cable has // gone down in 1956 , the system will be able to carry 36 conversations simultaneously . The aggregate length of submarine cables in use in 1955 exceeds 300,000 nautical miles . The method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the standard telegraph because the electric capacity , of a long cable requires considerable time for charging and discharging it . The current used is therefore relatively weak , because the weaker the current the shorter is the time required to charge and discharge the cable and so to transmit an individual signal . In other words , the weaker the current the more rapidly can a message be transmitted . A mirror galvanometer generally replaced the sounder to receive the signals . The mirror reflects a beam of light from a lamp in such a way that a small deflection of the coil on which the mirror is mounted gives a perceptible motion to the spot of light . The mirror was replaced in 187o by the siphon recorder developed by Sir William Thomson , consisting of a light coil of wire suspended between the poles of a powerful electromagnet . The motions of the coil are transmitted by silk threads to a small glass tube , one end dipping into an ink reservoir and the other recording on a paper tape . Some idea of the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of 650,000 telegrams which the British Post Office transmitted during one week in 1934 . Two-thirds of the messages were commercial and one-third were social . There can be little doubt that commercial demand for rapid transmission of messages was the principal incentive for the erection of the early telegraph lines in the 1840s . The telegraph business steadily increased during the nineteenth century , but it has declined during the twentieth . One of the principal causes for this decline has been the telephone . The incentives for developing the telephone were different from those which produced the telegraph . By the time the first work on telephones was being done , the telegraph had already satisfied much of man 's need for speed in the transmission of intelligence . Because of the less imperative incentives for the invention of a practical telephone , there were fewer men who worked on its invention , but they also were men of ability and imagination . In 1837 an American physician , Charles Grafton Page ( 1812 ? 1868 ) of Salem , Massachusetts , discovered that when there are rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note of a pitch depending on the frequency in the changes in magnetization . He called these sounds " galvanic music , " and many physicists studied this phenomenon in their // laboratories . It remained for Philipp leis ( 1834 ? 1874 ) of Friedrichsdorf , Germany , to construct in 186o an apparatus by means of which a melody produced in one place could be transmitted electrically and reproduced at a distance . Reis 's first apparatus consisted of a frustum of a cone inserted in the bunghole of a beer barrel . The small end was covered by an animal membrane upon which a small platinum wire was fastened by means of sealing wax . The platinum wire formed part of a battery circuit and touched a metal strip in such a manner that it could make and break contact as the diaphragm vibrated and interrupt a battery circuit with a frequency corresponding to the vibration of the diaphragm . The wires of the battery circuit led to a coil which was wound around a knitting needle . The rapid magnetization and demagnetization of this needle caused sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diaphragm . Reis successfully demonstrated the transmission of musical notes in an improved apparatus based on these principles at Frankfurt in 1861 . He claimed in a letter to a colleague in 1863 that " . . . if you will come and see me here , I will show you that words also can be made out . " 6 This claim has not been fully established , however . Be this as it may , Reis 's contribution was important in the history of the transmission of sound . In 1875 , two men in the United States were working independently and unknown to each other on telephonic transmission . They were Elisha Gray ( 1835 ? 1901 ) , inventor and manufacturer of Chicago , and Alexander Graham Bell ( 1847 ? 1922 ) of Boston . Gray developed an instrument very similar to Reis 's except that he used a small iron rod attached at one end to the diaphragm with the other end immersed in a fluid of low conductivity that formed part of the battery circuit . The vibrations of the diaphragm , by moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circuit , so that the resulting fluctuating current , depending on the varying resistance of the fluid , corresponded to the original sound vibrations impinging on the diaphragm . This fluctuating current was conducted to a receiver consisting of the coil of an electromagnet and a diaphragm on which was mounted a small piece of soft iron . The fluctuating current varied the magnetism and caused vibration of the iron on the diaphragm , which duplicated the vibration of the sending diaphragm and thus the sound . On February 14 , 1876 , Gray filed in the United States Patent ( ) flice a caveat , or formal notice of his claim to the idea of his instrument . He filed this caveat to endeavor to prevent others from patenting his . // idea within the period of a year . Bell applied for a patent for the same type of instrument a few hours earlier on the same day . Bell was finally awarded the patent rights and credit for the invention but only after extended and bitter litigation . Bell , Scottish-born and university-trained , had specialized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London to Canada in 1870 and two years later moved to Boston . Following an attempt to devise an instrument which he hoped would enable the deaf to see spoken words , he began to work on a telephone in 1874 . Discouraged by indifferent results with his early telephone , Bell had the good fortune to meet Joseph Henry in Washington . Henry encouraged the young man to continue his work . Bell not only succeeded in producing a liquid-resistance type of transmitter , but he also perfected the magnetic type , the iron diaphragm of which , vibrating in a magnetic field , produced variations in the field , thereby causing variations of current in the coil of wire around the magnet . These current variations , when transmitted to the receiving set , reproduced the vibrations of the sending diaphragm and so duplicated the original sound . It was on March Jo , 1876 , that Bell spoke the first words clearly heard over a telephone when he called to his assistant in his bedroom , " Mr. Watson , come here , I want you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , but he forgot the accident when Watson told him how plainly he had heard his summons . Later in 1876 , Bell showed his instruments at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia , where they created much interest . A commercial type of telephone was constructed early in 1877 , and by September there were 1,300 in use in the United States . The first community central station switchboard for interconnecting subscribers ' instruments was placed in operation with 22 subscribers in New Haven , Connecticut , on January 28 , 1878 ( Figure 11.2 ) . Numerous improvements were made in the years immediately following , and the use of telephones spread rapidly and continuously throughout the world . The stimuli for the invention of radio , like those for the telephone , were not as intense as the incentives for the invention of the electronmagnetic telegraph . By 1887 , when Hertz discovered electromagnetic waves , there were in operation extensive wire and cable lines transmitting tele graph and telephone messages . However , the possibility of sending mes- sages over lands and across oceans , especially from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic incentive . When the radio , or wireless , was first contemplated , its inventors thought of it only in terms of pointto-point transmission , and it was not until after the First World War that radio 's many potentialities for broadcasting began to be realized . Today general broadcasting is more important to our society than point-to-point message transmission . Hertz 's discovery was fundamental to the invention of the radio . I lertzian waves carry the radio signal , and without a knowledge of them it would not be possible to have radio . Several physicists , including the English Oliver Joseph Lodge ( 1851-1940 ) , realized the possibility of using hertzian waves for the transmission and reception of telegraphic messages . In 1894 Lodge described a device which consisted of a receiver tuned in proper resonance to collect waves , a detector , i.e. , a relay to amplifv the signals and a printer for recording dots and dashes . Lodge 's detector N as called a cohcrer , which involved also a trembler , and was based on the phenomena discovered in 1879 by David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hie cohcrer , which had been used two years earlier for other purposes , vas a short glass rube containing loose nickel filings . With // its terminals , it formed part of a local battery circuit . Hertzian waves captured in this receiver decreased the resistance of the filings , which " cohered " and allowed the current to flow from the battery through them . After conductivity had been established in the coherer , the filings continued to be a good conductor and therefore indicated no further response to the waves . Lodge restored the resistance of the filings by knocking them loose with the trembler , which tapped the tube . Lodge 's receiver worked , but as he was more interested in teaching and scientific research than in practical application , he did not devote himself to improving it for commercial purposes . In 1894 , the same year that Lodge demonstrated his receiver , Guglielmo Marconi ( 1874-1937 ) , a young Italian inventor , read about Hertz 's discovery . He immediately started to devise a practical method for wireless transmission . Marconi made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast and also increased the effectiveness of the coherer . In 1896 he succeeded in transmitting and receiving code messages over a distance of nearly 2 miles . Believing that there were better opportunities to develop his wireless commercially in England , he went there later in 1896 . Soon he was sending messages 8 miles . Beginning in 1897 , Marconi began experiments with long-distance trans- - mission , which culminated on December 12 , 1901 , when he heard on his receiver in Newfoundland the three clicks of the Morse code " S " which were sent out from his station at Poldhu in Cornwall , England . In the meantime , in 1898 , Lodge had invented the selective tuner . The coherer as a detector was inadequate , and John Ambrose Fleming , who was then a consultant with Marconi , invented the two-element , or diode ; vacuum tube using the principles of the Edison effect described above . The two terminals of this relay were an anode and an incandescent cathode which emitted electrons continuously . Fleming placed the tube , or valve as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The alternations of the incoming signals changed the anode from positive to negative , so that during the negative interval it repelled electrons emitted by the cathode and no current flowed . During the positive period the anode attracted electrons from the cathode , and the resulting current operated a printer or telephone receiver . Although Fleming 's invention is basic for radio , his diode was not very satisfactory in operation . The American inventor Lee de Forest ( 1873 ? ) greatly improved the diode in 1906 by inserting a grid in the vacuum tube between the cathode and anode . The grid , or metal screen , was attached electrically to the radio aerial , and the // alternating or oscillating charge on it would repel the electrons when negative and reinforce the electron stream when positive , giving a much more effective control of the current than was possible with the diode . Because it has three elements , De Forest 's tube- is called a triode . Both the diode and triode were operated at partial vacuums . At the same time that the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous-wave transmission as opposed to the make-and-break telegraphic spark was proceeding . Continuouswave transmission is , of course , necessary for voice transmission . Reginald Aubrey Fessenden ( 1866 ? 1932 ) in America , realizing the need for . a continuous wave , first produced one with an alternator in 1903 . It was Fessenden who invented the heterodvne circuit for receivers utilizing differences in frequency between the sending and receiving circuits . In 1914 Edwin Howard Armstrong ( 189o ? 1954 ) of Columbia University evolved the feed-back circuit , which greatly increased the reception sensitivity of a vacuum-tube receiver , and in 1918 the superheterodyne circuit , which is basic for modern radio and radar reception . By 1919 it was possible to produce efficient transmitters and receivers for voice broadcasts using the inventions of the previous twenty years . Until 1919 radio had been developed principally for point-to-point communication , like the telegraph and telephone . Since the early 1920s , however , broadcasting has brought receiving sets into individual homes where they provide a varied and popular form of entertainment . Home radios also bring news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's market prices for the farmer . Radio often serves as a means of rapid communication to members of a community during local disasters . It is used to attempt to mold public opinion , and in countries where broadcasting is a monopoly of the government a considerable degree of control can be maintained over the public by propaganda . During the past three decades radio has become one of the most important channels for communications . The original broadcasting stations used amplitude modulation ( AM ) of the radio wave , whereby the frequency of the sound waves varies the amplitude of the high-frequency radio waves which transmit the message for receipt and reconversion to sound . Defective electric motors and other apparatus , electrical storms , and electric discharges may add their own amplitude to the wave , causing interference or what is known as static . The most important development in radio since broadcasting became coninion has been the introduction of frequencv modulation ( FM ) , // invented in 1933 by E. H. Armstrong of feed-hack and superheterodyne fame . FM has a higher fidelity than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FM system the variation in the radio waves as produced from the sound waves is a variation in frequency rather than amplitude . Since the signals are not dependent on the amplitude of the radio wave , the outside interference referred to is not experienced in this system . It is the FM system which transmits the signals accompanying television broadcasts in the United States . Television , a word formed by the combination of Greek and Latin words meaning " sight at a distance , " signifies the broadcasting of live scenes or moving pictures by radio waves . Television is a direct development from sound broadcasting and consists of converting light into electrical impulses , transmitting these impulses and reconverting them at the receiving station into their original form , namely , light . The foundations on which electronic television rest are three ? radio , the cathode tube already described , and what is known as the photoelectric effect , which Heinrich Hertz first discovered in 1887 . Fundamentally , television is a scanning process at both the sending and receiving stations . At the sending station a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube called an Iconoscope or Orthicon - scans exceedingly rapidly a mosaic of photoelectric cells on a plate on which a camera lens has focused an image . Each minute photoelectric cell has on it a positive electric charge proportional to the amount of light falling on the cell . The electrons in the scanning beam discharge each of the more than 300,000 cells individually , and the resulting electric impulse proportional to the amount of light falling on the cell is collected from a conductive surface on the hack of the mosaic and transmitted . The Orthicon thus converts the optical image into corresponding electrical impulses . The electron beam in the present black-and-white television camera in the United States scans each one of 525 horizontal lines of photoelectric cells on the mosaic thirty times each second . Since each of these lines in the devices now standard in the United States has about 600 photoelectric cells , 315,000 separate impulses are sent out in 1/30 second . At the receiving station another cathode tube called a Kinescope is so arranged that the electron beam , the size of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot in proportion to the energy in the beam at a given instant , and thus converting the electrical images back into light . The transmission of the picture consists of synchronously scanELECTRICAL // ring , or sweeping the electronic beams in the sending and receiving tubes across the plate at the sending station and the screen at the receiving station . The scanning is similar to the technique of reading a printed page , line by line and word for word in each line . The electron beam in the receiving set must , of course , be perfectly synchronized in both vertical and horizontal motion at all times with the beam in the sending camera . An enormous amount of applied research was necessary to bring television to its present status . In 1862 the Italian Abbe Giovanni Caselli ( i 815-1891 ) used a crude mechanical scanning device in his partially successful attempt to transmit images over a telegraph wire , and in 1884 Paul Gottlieb Nipkow ( 186o ? 194o ) , a German engineer , further developed mechanical scanning . His device consisted of a disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spiral , each hole being just a little nearer the center of the disk than the one preceding it . In 1907 Boris Rosing of the St. Petersburg Technical Institute using an electronic receiver , a cathode-ray tube having an electron gun at one end and a fluorescent screen at the other , endeavored to develop a mechanical scanning transmitter consisting of mirrors on two drums revolving at right angles to one another . The vertical drum revolving at high speed scanned horizontally and the horizontal drum , revolving much more slowly , shifted the scanning line . Although Rosing 's system was capable of transmitting and reproducing poorly defined action images , it was . far from having any practical value , mainly because it did not have an amplifier . Herbert E. Ives and Charles F. Jenkins in the United States and John I .. Baird in England developed mechanical scanning systems in the late 19215 . Ives used 48 lines and Jenkins between 30 and 6o . The Jenkins Television Company failed financially before it began broadcasting , and although the British Broadcasting Company began limited television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been a commercial success . I n a letter to the magazine Nature , in 1908 , A. A. Campbell-Swinton ( 1863 ? 1930 ) of London University suggested a television system using an electronic scanner as well as an electronic receiver . In 1917 , Vladimir Kosma Zworykin ( 1889 ? ) , one of Rosing 's students , began to develop electronic television for the Russian Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Companv . After the Russian revolution , Zworvkin emigrated to the United States , where he subsequently invented the Iconoscope . Zworykin also developed the Kinescope based on the principle which hosing used in 1907 . The first demonstration of Zworykin 's system was // at Rochester , New York , in 1929 ; the number of scanning lines was 120 . Following extensive improvements in the details of Zworykin 's electronic system , television broadcasting began in the United States on July 1 , 1941 . The Second World War prevented the extension of television facilities , but beginning in 1946 they expanded rapidly . Commercial television was in black and white until 1954 when color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , began to be broadcast . In addition to broadcasting programs for purposes of education and amusement , there are many special uses of radio and television . Radio beams help pilots to find their airports . One of the applications of radio is known as radar ( radio detection and range ) . First patented in Germany in 1904 and developed during the 1930S by the armed services in the United States , England , France , and Germany , radar initially found wide use during the Second World War . With this device it is possible to detect objects and to determine how far away and in what direction they are from the observer . Using very short radio waves , a radar set sends out a pulse which is reflected by objects . The set then picks up the reflected rays , or echo , and the distance to the object is determined by the elapsed time between the sending of the pulse and the reception of the echo measured in hundredths of a microsecond , the speed of the waves being a known quantity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A radar device on board a ship may pick up any object , such as another vessel , an iceberg , or an exposed rock , even when visibility is zero , as in fog . Many airports are equipped with radar to facilitate the control of air traffic and to assist in guiding planes safely into the airport during periods of low visibility . Meteorologists also employ it to detect and trace storms . A number of other specialized applications of radio waves have been developed , particularly to assist in navigation of ships and aircraft . Some of the devices have been given names made up as acrostics similar to that designating radar , such as loran ( long-range navigation ) and shoran ( short-range navigation ) . Some of the schemes make use of the known speed of radio waves emitted from the shore or from a ship or aircraft to shore stations . Others employ waves of differing frequencies broadcast from shore stations and analyzed on the ship or plane .

Not the least of radio aids to navigators is the dissemination of time signals , which permit the navigator to check his chronometer accurately .
