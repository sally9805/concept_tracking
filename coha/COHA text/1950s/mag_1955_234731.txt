When Vivian Chamberlain , 34 , died in Stockton , Calif , last week , she was the fourth of 14 siblings to be carried off by a mysterious , muscle-wasting disease . Vivian was 15 when she was stricken with what doctors believed to be muscular dystropny-a progressive wasting away of muscle power for which neither cause nor cure is known . She had gradually become disabled , spent her last two months in San Joaquin General Hospital . When Vivian the first ominous stiffening in her ankles , followed by weakness and loss of balance , one sister had already died . She lived to see another sister and a brother die of complaints suggesting muscular dystrophy , which tends to sweep through whole families . A third sister had been in the hospital for two years ; two others are disabled but still at home . <P> The other half of the Chamberlain brood-two sisters , five brothers , aged 20 to 39-all seem perfectly healthy .                   @ @
