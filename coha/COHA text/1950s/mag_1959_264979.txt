Time and again painkilling drugs have been touted as more potent than morphine and less likely to cause addiction , only to show , after careful trials , the same drawbacks as the invaluable but dangerous derivative of the opium poppy . Last week Secretary Arthur Flemming of Health , Education and Welfare got himself out on a limb by announcing as " an exciting breakthrough " the development of a new analgesic at the National Institutes of Health . Known so far only as NIH 7519 , it appears , he said , to have " painkilling power at least ten times that of morphine . " ( By this phrasing , scientists do not mean that it can kill pain ten times as severe as morphine does , but that it kills the same pain with one-tenth the dose . ) At the same time , said Flemming , " it gives preliminary promise that a partial separation of the analgesic and addicting properties may have been achieved . " <P> Fact is that , so far , NIH 7519 has had such limited trials on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a painkiller it is-or , consequently , what dose to give . Addiction dangers are directly related to continued use . Most of the hopeful evidence on addiction comes from monkeys ; though tests are under way with narcotics addicts at the Public Health Service Addiction Research Center in Lexington , Ky. , results are only preliminary . <P> NIH 7519 has one undeniable advantage . Member of a chemical family called benzomorphans , it is entirely synthetic . If it proves as valuable a morphine substitute as Secretary Flemming hopes , it will free the U.S. of dependence on imported opium , which is becoming harder to get in world markets and might be cut off entirely in global war .
