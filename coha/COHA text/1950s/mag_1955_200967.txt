The President of the U.S. was discussing the July Big Four meeting with his Secretary of State when the air-raid horn burped through the White House . Old Soldier Eisenhower stood up , shook hands with Dulles and quickly strode to the portico . While sirens brayed over Washington and staff members lugged out heavy suitcases , the President put on his glasses and checked his watch . It was exactly 12:03 . He ducked into his limousine with Deputy Assistant Fred Seaton and Special Counsel Gerald Morgan , and Secret Service Driver Deeter Flohr headed the car out the southwest gate . Right on its bumper was a 1938 open Cadillac loaded with Secret Servicemen , and behind it , three carloads of newsmen . For the first time since the War of 1812 , when President Madison fled to the Virginia countryside , the U.S. Government was fleeing Washington . The President and 15,000 federal employees were evacuating the capital to spend three days at 31 secret sites during the nationwide civil defense test , Operation Alert . <P> Deeter Flohr jockeyed the big black car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge to a supposedly secret route-but along the way schoolchildren and parents with cameras were waiting for a glimpse of Ike . The President 's car whizzed past those of other Government officials . Foreign Economic Adviser Joseph M. Dodge at the wheel of a Ford , Under Secretary of State Herbert Hoover Jr . driving a blue sedan with the State Department markings covered up . <P> The President 's car swung off the main highway onto a steep , narrow mountain road lined with troops , came to a cluster of olive drab Army tents identified as " Bureau of the Budget . " " ODM , " " Stabilization , " ' ' Manpower , " " Men 's Latrine . " . The breeze whined through a forest of antennae . <P> Lunch Came First . Ike inspected the area , returned to an airless , sunbaked tent , where he sat behind a butcher-paper-covered field table , greeted Government officials as they arrived . In all , the heads of 32 agencies and departments reported . One of the last was Health and Education Secretary Oveta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered where you were . I looked for you . " Mrs Hobby , white-gloved and sleekly coifed , confessed she stopped for lunch along the way . <P> The tent was dominated by a huge map of the U.S. with blue pins to show air bursts and red pins to show the more radioactive surface bursts in the biggest civil defense test yet . All afternoon and evening the reports came in : an A-bomb on Seattle ; an atomic guided missile hit Anchorage . Alaska ; an A-bomb struck the Capitol ; an H-bomb on Brooklyn ; a submarine hit Balboa Heights , C.Z. with an atomic missile . American cities under attack : Los Angeles , Baltimore .
