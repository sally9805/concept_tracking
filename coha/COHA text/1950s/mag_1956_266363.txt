Biggest international art fair in the world is the 61-year-old Venice Biennale , held on the quarter-mile stretch of pavilions that was once Venice 's marine arsenal . This year the show is bigger than ever before-more than 5,000 works of art from 34 nations-but critics last week were grumbling that the " Biennale is going downhill . " Wrote Italian Critic Leonardo Borgese : " The show leaves . . . a sense of emptiness and bitterness , a sense of humiliation ; one feels all are guilty , and does not know precisely why . " Replied an Italian museum director : " Whenever the critics are so angry , it indicates something important is going on . " <P> Just what was going on , however , fairgoers and critics were at a loss to say . The Russians , back in their refurbished Muscovite pavilion for the first time since 1932 , drew the biggest crowds . But the official , Stalin-period art ( stocky peasant girls laughingly sheafing wheat ) soon drove them away . The U.S. exhibit ( TIME , June 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mainly because it stuck to one theme : " The City . ' ' Best that could be said : the Biennale was immense . <P> The task of sampling the whole ragout , then awarding the prizes , fell to a 30-man international jury . After days of wrangling , their decisions ( on majority vote ) : <P> Painting Prize ( $2,400 ) : to France 's Jacques Villon , 80 ( TIME , June 6 , 1955 ) , who showed 38 paintings . Early Cubist Villon ( who changed his name from Duchamp to hide his early art activity from his stern Normandy father ) is a member of a long-famous painting family , which includes his brothers , Cubist Sculptor Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel ( Nude Descending a Staircase ) Duchamp . For years Jacques Villon was out of the limelight , working as a newspaper cartoonist and engraver . He began achieving belated recognition when he won first prize in the 1950 Carnegie International . <P> Sculpture Prize ( $2,400 ) : to Britain 's London-born Lynn Chadwick , 41 , whose early mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calder and whose welded sculpture ran second place to Britain 's Reg Butler . This year Chadwick ( who works mostly in iron ) moved into the lead with his 19 angular , spiky sculptures that came close to being the hit of the Biennale . One of the most discussed works : Inner Eye ( see cut ) , a 7-ft. iron structure with a quartz crystal gripped on spiked arms . It looked alarmingly like a radar man from Mars . <P> Engraving Prize ( $400 ) : to Japan 's Shiko Munakata , 53 , short , unshaven and extremely nearsighted , famed for his rough , violent drawing technique , who showed six engravings . <P> Drawing Prize ( $400 ) : to Brazil 's Aldemir Martins , 34 , for his six clean-lined drawings , which included birds and human figures that won his prize in this year 's Sao Paulo Benal . <P> One award had the jury stopped : an $800 prize donated by Rome 's Obelisco Gallery for the " most nonconformist " work . After surveying the field ( including a blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal punctured by 3-in. nails on which were impaled two pingpong balls ) , the international jury gave up , decided that the task of picking only one was impossible .
