The Green Bay Tree ( by Mordaunt Shairp ; produced by Shepard Traube ) seemed a better play 17 years ago , and unquestionably received a better production . It is still a reasonably interesting theater piece ; it still provides a brittle , glassy surface for certain emotions to skate over if no longer cut beneath . <P> In the new production , it is rather a sybaritic than a homosexual Mr. Dulcimer who has brought up his adopted son Julian to have the most expensive tastes and play a purely decorative role . Then at 23 Julian falls in love . Mr. Dulcimer can only counter by saying that marriage means being cut off without a button . Love , with a spineless young man who hates work , proves no match against luxury . At the end , Julian has not only inherited his guardian 's money , but has adopted his fastidious ways . <P> The end is pat , as the whole play is perhaps too prettily made . Psychologically . The Green Bay Tree does n't always hold water ; but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be filled with Pernod . Playwright Shairp clearly sought to develop an unnatural situation as much on a basis of tone as of truth . As currently produced , it offers less than it might of either . Denholm Elliott sufficiently captures Julian 's wishy-washy charm . But Joseph Schildkraut reduces Mr. Dulcimer to a mere fussy epicure ; and such is Schildkraut 's own personality that he comes off rather more a continental bon vivant.
