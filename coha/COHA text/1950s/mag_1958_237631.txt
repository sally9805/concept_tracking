For the first time in modern U.S. history , a federal court last week restricted the President 's powers to adjust tariffs . The three-judge U.S. Customs Court in New York ruled 2 to i that the President can not alter the recommendations of the U.S. Tariff Commission under the " escape clause " of the Trade Agreements Act , which permits the President to adjust tariffs or impose quotas to help U.S. industries that can prove they are being damaged by imports . <P> The ruling was handed down in the case of bicycle tariffs . In March 1955 the Tariff Commission recommended an increase in duties on large-wheel , lightweight bicycles from 7% of value to 22% of value . The President boosted duties to only ni% of value . He erred , ruled the court : " If the President does not accept the findings of the commission , he should reject them , not compromise them . " <P> The decision would invalidate the President 's approval of tariff boosts for spring clothespins and clover seed-both milder increases than those suggested by the Tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotas on lead and zinc ( TIME , Oct. 6 ) . <P> The U.S. is expected to appeal the ruling . If it stands , it will cost the U.S. millions in refunds to importers . More important , it may well put added pressure on the President to approve the often high Tariff Commission recommendations rather than give no relief at all .
