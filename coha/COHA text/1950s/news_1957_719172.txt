txt Boston 's humdrum preliminary election yesterday was a shoo-in for the incumbents of both the City Council and the School Committee . All the top places were captured by present office-holddrs as only 17 per cent of the registered voters turned out . David Lasker , election commission chairman , who had optimistically forecast a 30 per cent turnout , termed this demonstration of voter apathy " disheartening and discouraging . " ' The contest cost the city nearly $100,000 or about $2 a ballot , he said . In four other cities the voter turnout was better , ranging between 40 and 52 per cent in Malden , Medford , Chelsea , and Everett . One significant victory occurred in Medford , where ousted city manager James F. ShurtlefT topped a field of 32 candidates for the city council , including the incumbents who tired him . Mayor Hugh of Chelsea scored a lopsided victory that virtually assured him of November election and Mayor Philip J. Crowley of Everett led by a wide margin . In Malden , Walter J. Kelleher , an unsuccessful mayoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small margin . , Teachers ' Vote Clear In Boston , clue to the meager turnout , the teachers ' vote was clearly in evidence as school committee chairman John P. and committee member George F. Hurley placed first and second respectively in their bids for relection . In the City Council race , Councilor Patrick F. surprised many by taking first place . The second and third spots were captured by incumbents Edward J. McCormack and William J. Foley , Jr. , council president . Chairman and Mr. Hurley of the school committee both opposed $756 salary increases given to high school leachers three weeks ago by the three-man committee majority compared to the $264 raises granted to elementary teachers . They supported flat $300 hikes . Third , fourth , and fifth places were taken by committeemen William F. Carr , Timothy J. , and Joseph Lee , who favored the ? high school differential . Mr. , who has been outspoken on the issue , climbed to first place from the fifth spot he captured in the final election two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We definitely feel that and Lee can be defeated , and perhaps also Mr. Carr , " said Mark J. Dalton , executive secretary of the Boston Teachers Alliance , which has opposed the three . School Fight Shapes Up Among the other nominees I John J. Tierney , a lawyer and former . policeman , made a good showing , coming in sixth , just " ! below Mr : Lee . Both the Teachers Alliance and the newly organized Emergency League for Better Schools are expected to meet later this week to discuss candidates they will support as potential replacements for the three majority members . In the city council race it seems apparent that all eight incumbents who ran for reelection will hold on to their jobs . The principal question is who will fill the ninth spot left vacant by Francis X. Ahearn , who has been appointed deputy secretary of state . Chief contender appears to be Peter F. Hines , son of Col. Paul Hines , industrial adviser to the Mayor . The Mayor does not come up for reelection until 1959 . Undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Nobile , who was Republican candidate for state auditor two years ago . Mr. Nobile was a fourth choice of the halo-Americans in the ' West End . He also failed to get much support from Back Bay and Beacon Hill , and although more Republicans undoubtedly will turn out for the final election , this is not expected to make up the difference ,
