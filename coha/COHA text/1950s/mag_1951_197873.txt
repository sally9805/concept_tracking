If an atom bomb should hit a big U.S. city , the lives of more than 100,000 injured might be saved by prompt transfusions of blood , blood plasma or proper plasma substitutes . Under present conditions , nearly all these people would die . There is not enough blood , plasma or substitutes . Researchers are now looking frantically for acceptable and plentiful substitutes for plasma . Most injuries caused by atomic bombs ( wounds , burns , radiation damage ) result in loss of fluids from the blood vessels . The blood does not circulate properly , and the tissues , including the brain , do not get the oxygen and other supplies they need . The result is " shock , " which means that the patient 's blood volume must be increased promptly to restore circulation . <P> The simplest way is to administer dilute salt or glucose solution by vein . But the effect lasts only a short time . Blood plasma , the clear portion of human blood , is better . It contains protein molecules of a definite size and shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An emergency plasma substitute needs some harmless substance with the same sort of molecules . Several such substances , including gelatin , Dextran ( a complex sugarlike compound ) and PVP ( polyvinyl pyrrolidone ) , a synthetic made from acetylene , do the job to some extent , but none is both plentiful and entirely satisfactory . Okra for Shock . One new idea is an extract of the slippery vegetable , okra . Dr. Hiram B. Benjamin of Marquette Medical School , Milwaukee , discovered more or less by accident that an okra extract he was testing as a cure for stomach ulcers could be injected without immediate damage into the veins of dogs . Apparently the okra extract contains polysaccharide molecules similar to Dextran . Other blood experts say that the okra idea must be tested more thoroughly , on humans as well as dogs . <P> All plasma substitutes offer the danger of putting large amounts of foreign matter into the blood . If they damage some organ , the ill effects may not show up for years-so doctors like to be careful . Plasma substitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , but experts would prefer real plasma , or better yet , whole blood . <P> The trouble with whole blood is that it can not be stockpiled . It contains living cells ( white and red corpuscles ) and therefore can not be dried , frozen or preserved with chemicals . At present , it can be kept for only three weeks . <P> Long-Lasting Blood . One of the projects of blood research is to find ways to preserve whole blood . Dr. Max Strumia of Bryn Mawr , Pa. is working on a method of controlling the temperature , acidity and sugar content of blood . He thinks he may be able to preserve it for nine weeks , thus tripling the nation 's stockpiled supply . <P> There is no chance of making whole blood artificially . It contains many delicate chemicals , each of which fills some requirement of the body . Its living cells can not be duplicated . If the patient has been bleeding seriously , either internally or externally , he needs the corpuscles as well as the fluid . Radiation damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpuscles . In an atomic-bomb attack , tens of thousands of such cases would need whole blood-and nothing else would do .
