Man of the Year <P> Sir : <P> My choice : Harold Macmillan , the genuine promoter of the international plan as well as an unprecedented victor in home politics . <P> <P> BERNARD SINSHEIMER Paris <P> Sir : <P> Nikita Khrushchev , who has proved he is the man of a new era by sending the Communist pennant right to the inaccessible moon ! <P> <P> GERARD LANGLOIS <P> Quebec <P> Sir : <P> Please consider the late John Foster Dulles , who unstintingly gave his life to his country and the world for the cause of peace . <P> KAY A. SUSMEYAN <P> Newton , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : <P> The American Taxpayer . <P> <P> PHILIP F. CONNELL <P> Portland , Me . <P> <P> Sir : <P> The Man in the Moon , owner of our universe 's most publicized backside . <P> <P> PAUL W. FARDY Toronto <P> National Purpose <P> Sir : <P> As a student and prospective American citizen , I am naturally very much interested in the destiny of the United States as a nation . This country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main proponent of democratic ideology . It faces the greatest task in its entire history : to contain the forces of Communism and to remain at the pinnacle of world power ; yet , it receives only superficial and passive support from a great number of its citizens . <P> By presenting the issue of national purpose in such conspicuous fashion Nov. 16 , you have performed a valuable public service true to the tradition of the American press as one of the principal agents in the process of public opinion formation . <P> <P> EDWARD A. SPILLER <P> Berkeley , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> One new and grievous error seems to have crept into the thinking of the American people . This involves the idea that all we need for success is to get organized and wait for someone to " articulate a purpose " for us . This hen-and-chickens kind of thinking led the Germans into a disastrous war under the leadership of an articulate , power-mad Hitler . <P> <P> WARREN J. KING <P> Claremore , Okla . <P> <P> Sir : <P> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexcusable ignorance of our history . <P> The Preamble of the Constitution affirms that we are established " in order to form a more perfect Union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty . " The Articles of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , as the founding fathers saw it , provided the framework for the accomplishment of these purposes . <P> It would be far better to ask ourselves whether we have achieved these stated purposes . Have we formed a more perfect Union ? Have we ensured domestic tranquillity ? Have we established justice ? Have we secured the blessings of liberty ? <P> Need I point out that our present-day industrial strife , our rampant racialism , our subversion of the Bill of Rights , our continuous wrangling over states ' rights , etc. , indicate that we have failed to achieve our stated national purposes rather than that we do not have any national purposes ? <P> <P> WILLIAM E.
