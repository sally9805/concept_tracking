The Doctors Who Crack Down on Doctors By MILTON SILT/ERMAN Leaders in California 's " medical revolution " : ACC.M.A. president Dr. I hired ( ' Maloney , troubleshooter Konen Waterson and Dr. James Craeser. of fall a young mother came to the offices of a county medical society near San Fran-cisco and objected strenuously to the bill she had just received from her obstetrician . " He 's charging us seven hundred dollars for a Caesarean operation , " she said . " I thought the standard price around here is only two hundred and fifty . " " Yes , the usual fee is two hundred and fifty , " said an association official . " But are you sure the doctor did n't mention a higher fee to you beforehand ? " The woman shook her head . - He did n't mention any fee before the operation , " she said . " And now he wo n't even discuss the bill with me . " " All right , we 'll look into it . " Three weeks later , after an exhaustive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special committees visited the obstetrician . " Your patient can probably afford to pay you seven hundred , " he said , " but that does n't seem to he the point . You did n't tell her ahead of time that you were going to charge her more than the usual fee . There 's nothing on the record to show she had any complications . You did n't give her any special services . " " So what ? " " Well , can you bring your price down to the usual fee ' ? We 've all agreed that this plan is best for the public , and " I do n't believe in that nonsense ! " snapped the obstetrician . " Nobody is going to tell me how to charge my patients . She pays me that seven hundred in full or I take it to court . And how do you like that ? " " Of course , it 's up to you , " said the chairman . " But the members of my committee have instructed me to tell you this : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your patient is defended by the attorney for the county medical association . And , if necessary , we 'll put every doctor on the committee on the stand to testify that your fee is extortionate . " " I guess I made a mistake , " the obstetrician said . " The bill is the usual two hundred and fifty . " To many observers , this memorable case served as a notice that one medical group had finally found an effective substitute for the traditional but irritating system of charging a patient according to his supposed ability to pay . They had set up local schedules of what seem to be fair and reasonable fees , and then voted to use these as a yardstick . " The plan does not change the right of a physician to charge whatever price be wants , " an association leader said . " He can always charge less . He can also charge more if there are complications , or if he thinks he has particular qualifications , or if his patient demands special services , or merely if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here is the point that makes the difference ? if any physician charges more than the official " usual fee " in his community without first obtaining the patient 's agreement , and the patient then objects , I he medical association will come to the support of the patient . This remarkable new program , aimed primarily at putting the business part of medicine on an open , businesslike halide , was introduced during 1953 in California 's East Bay counties  --  Alameda and Contra Costa , just across the bay from San Francisco . To those who have watched the strange developments in medical economics , it was scarcely surprising that the East Bay doctors were the first to attempt the fateful experiment . In the pant decade they have repeatedly pioneered in this field . Sparkplugging their activities has been a group of dedicated physicians who tried several years ago to clean up one messy case , and who found they could succeed only by starting a major revolution . And with them for eight hectic , history-making years wasa young layman who had been trained as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwestern movie theaters and depart ment stores . " In those businesses , " he said recently , " you learn that when you 've been kicking the customers around , it does n't do any good to tell them through the newspapers and radio how wonderful you are . First you stop kicking them around . " The doctors followed this prescription faithfully . When they , like other medical groups all over the country , were bitterly attacked for refusing to answer night calla , declining to treat patients without a guarantee of payment , charging scandalously high prices , unethically splitting fees , performing needless operations and committing malpractice , the East Bay physicians did not blame all these sins on 1 he small minority of miscreants who were actually responsible . They did not attempt to deny , justify or explain . They did not denounce all their accusers as communists or proponents of socialized medicine , or merely insist that American medicine is the best medicine . " First , we looked to see where we were kicking our patients around , " says one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They set up a day-and-night telephone-answering system and an emergency doctor-dispatching program , and Then advertised in the newspapers an unconditional guarantee to provide needed medical care to any patient , twenty-four hours a day , regardless of ability to pay . They organized a workable program to provide medical and legal aid to any patient who had been victimized by a gouging physician . When they found that bill collectors were going after unpaid medical bills with possibly excessive enthusiasm  --  and thus making more enemies for the medical profession ? they did not try to wriggle out by blaming the bill collectors . They set up their own agency to collect bills , rarely by going to court , but usually by working out a reasonable payment plan which met the approval of the individual patient . And when many medical groups were busily denying that any doctors were guilty of malpractice or even more busily attempting to hush any discussion of the delicate topic , the East Bay doctors set up a special investigating committee  --  with a two-fisted clergyman representing the public ? to protect patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee was to prevent malpractice wherever possible , provide the remedy when it did occur , but never to hide it . This attitude may be annoying to many doctors ? in fact , it has caused some of them to denounce the East Bay medical group in a highly unfraternal fashion  --  but it has apparently paid off , and many of the policies developed in Alameda and Contra Costa counties are spreading to other parts of California and to other areas of the United States . " It has long since become apparent , " says Dr. Walter B. Martin , president of the American Medical Association , that the programs put into effect by the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association  --  put into effect , and not merely discussed ? represent a major advance in medical practice . That group has repeatedly spearheaded the medical profession 's efforts to improve physician-patient relationships . It has served as a testing ground for many policies now being adopted by the AMA . Its many successful projects richly deserve the praise of both patients and doctors . " Alameda County , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he an ideal test ground for such research . With a total population now of about 800,000 , it includes the metropolitan city of Oakland , the college city of Berkeley with its University of California , busy manufacturing centers , farming communities , thriving residential suburbs , a few great estates , and some areas little better than slums . Adjoining it is Contra Costa County , with a population of about 350,000 , and also with farming areas , factories and attractive suburban towns . Alameda County also happens to be the home base of Henry J. Kaiser , and his controversial closed-panel health-insurance system , the Kaiser Health Foundation . Some cynics have charged that it was Kaiser who made the East Bay doctors reform as a defense against his own medical plan . This is an engaging idea , but it is not supported by the record . The local group began its activities long before Kaiser 's programwas even a small thorn in the flank of organized medicine . It has also been charged that the East Bay doctors were forced into their role because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . This , too , is unsupported by the record . The explanation for the revolution is apparently far simpler : the East Bay doctors did n't think betterthan-average treatment for their patients was good enough . The event which probably did more than anything else to get this revolution into high gear was the frustrating case of a six-year-old girl who had run a splinter into her eye . A physician removed the splinter , apparently saved the child 's sight and then rendered a bill for $1200 . " We ca n't tell you bow grateful we are , " the girl 's father said , " but your bill has staggered us . " " What 's the matter ? " asked the doctor . " Do n't you think your daughter 's eye is worth twelve hundred dol-lars ? " " My daughter 's eye is worth a million dollars , " said the father . " But we just have n't got twelve hundred dollars now . " " Get it , " said the doctor . When details of the case were reported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of its ruling council were horrified . But although they first pleaded with the eye doctor , then argued with him , and finally denounced him , they could not budge him from his stand . At the time  --  about ten years ago  --  it seemed there was nothing else that the medical association could do . Its Council members confessed they were powerless to correct the situation . To a small nucleus of East Bay doctors , however , the case of the $1200 fee was only the beginning . Stung by this first defeat , they started to look more closely into medicine as it was actually practiced in their communities , and what they saw made them even more furious . " In our survey we have uncovered numerous cases in which an unfortunate overcharge has been made , " reported the late Dr. Gertrude Moore . 11 In C./11 . Unl//11 IUT11.11111,1. ? 1-1. / . " 3 I - 133-  " Something is wrong . The price tag is becoming the most important thing in medicine . We must do something about it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy of organized medicine . Described as a pint-sized lire-eater , she was a woman of devastating honesty , one of t he most respected pathologists in the country and secretary-treinuirer of the county medical emaciation . " We do n't have time to do I his kind of a job , " she said . " We do n't even know how to do it . We 'd better get a good man to come in and show us how . " The man they got was an unassuming , self-effacing , thirty-seven-year-old Hoosier named Rollen Waterson . Fifteen years before , he had gone to work for a movie-theater chain in Illinois , sweeping out the floors , playing the organ , later booking stage shows , and finally writing advertisements for the current attractions . " That was in the middle of the depression . " he says . " Business was terrible . And some of the pictures we showed were even worse . " He adopted an unusual technique to tout these cinematic turkeys . When he felt the occasion demanded , he told the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  but we have it anyhow . There 'll be a better one next week . " Movie-goers were astonished by this candor , but soon found they could trust Waterson 's advertisements , and business picked up . One theater which bad been losing $4000 a week was enabled to lose only $1000 a week . Waterson thought this was a real improvement and entitled him to a slight raise . He asked for it and was fired . Next he was employed by a string of Midwestern department stores , assigned to find why they were steadily losing money He sat in complaint departments and watched employees insult the customers . He saw the stores refuse to back up their guarantees of " guaranteed nonshrinkable " merchandise . He saw salesmen use every possible device to keep from waiting on potential buyers . " You 're just kicking your customers in the teeth , " he told store officials . " If you stop , they may appreciate it . " At his urging , salesmen were put on a commission based on an increase in their sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Employees found they made more money by keeping their customers satisfied , and the results were amazing . Business and profits skyrocketed . All you had to do was see what the customer needed , and then give it to him , " Waterson said . " People were astounded that the technique worked . " In 1939 he was asked to go to the rescue of the county medical society in Lake County , Indiana . " But . I ca n't help you , " he argued . " I 'm not a doctor . I do n't know anything about medicine . " " Mr. Waterson , " the Indiana doctors told him , " you seem to know about people . We want you . " For six years he served as executive secretary of the Indiana group , helping the doctors to solve some of their pressing public-relations problems , ending the control of hospitals and clinics by grasping politicians , and at the same time learning some of the inner workings of organized medicine . Then one day he met Dr. Harry J. Templeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing about your work in Indiana , " the physician said . " Maybe you 're the man who can help us . We 've got some shortsighted doctors in our group , and we do n't know what to do about them . There 're not many of those fellows , but they 're giving all of us a had name . Will you come out and give us some ideas ? " In the spring of 1945 , Waterson went to Alameda County and met with the entire medical association . He outlined a general program and suggested the employment of an executive secretary In carry it out . The association immediately voiced its approval and voted the necessary funds . At once Doctor Templeton , fiery little Dr. Gertrude Moore and the other leaders of the society moved into an adjoining room for an executive session . Before anyone else could say a word , Doctor Moore announced , " That 's enough discussion ! He 's the man we want for the job . " " Wait a minute , Gerty , " another physician objected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What could he know about medicine ? " " How much good have our degrees done us ? We 've still got this mess here . Go out and grab that young man before be gets away from us . " Fifteen minutes later the startled Waterson was offered the job , and quickly accepted it . Some of his new employers thought they had hired a publicity man who would promptly turn out great quanties of laudatory information for press and radio . They were soon disillusioned . " There can no longer be any doubt that the organized medical profession has failed to earn good relations with the public , " he told them . " Before we do any publicizing , before we wrap up our package in fancy paper and present it to the public , let 's he sure that the contents of the package are uniformly good . " He also indicated that , in his mind , medical ethics are for the protection of the public , not for the protection of the doctor . " This seemed to be one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said one physician . " It did n't take long for the rest of the boys to find out we really meant it . " One of the first doctors to make the discovery himself was a specialist who demanded seventy dollars for some minor services which the medical association estimated , after investigation , to be worth not more than ten dollars . Acting upon the patient 's complaint , association officials urged the doctor to reduce his bill , if only for the good name of medicine . " I decide how to treat my patients , and I decide how to charge them , " he said . " I 'm bringing suit against the patient . " The council of the medical association met and discussed the situation . " It 's just like that case of the girl with the splinter in her eye , " a council member said . " There 's nothing we can do . " " I think there 's something we can do , " said Waterson . " We can see to it that the patient is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the association 's expense . " " You mean , have our own lawyer appear against one of our own members ? Why , we 've never done anything like that before ! " " I know , " agreed Waterson . " It might be effective . " The results were epoch-making . Joseph Rankin , attorney for the association , appeared in court to defend the patient and called to the witness stand a battery of specialists who all testified that the bill was too high . The judge quickly and forcefully ruled for the patient . It was the last time an East Bay doctor went to court to collect what his colleagues described as an extortionate hill . The final score for the maneuver : one irate ? hut wiser  --  specialist , one delighted patient ? who soon told scores of her friends about the new look in local medical practice  --  and a growing group of doctors all over the county who expressed their warm approval and rallied to the support of the new program . More support came when the association turned to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : what to do n bout physicians returning From military duty . " While we were still overseas , we began hearing about it , " recalls one Oakland surgeon . " In one city after another , we were told , stay-at-home doctors had taken over our practices , our hospital appointments and our office space , and would n't give them up . We were n't welcome . " This young surgeon returned and discovered his stay-at-home iailleagues in Alameda County had adopted im unexpected attitude . They haul reserved his hospital appointments for him , I hey urged his former patients to return to his care , and they laid hired their own real-estnte ngcml In tind him desirable office space . You know , " he told Waterson soon after his arrival , " I never dreamed I 'd get a reception like this . But there 's still one problem . After four years in the Army , we 're broke . I 've got to see if I can borrow some money somewhere to keep us going for a while . " " Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your fellow doctors here have set up a loan fund for just this purpose . We 'll write you a check now for a thousand dollars . No interest , of course . Please let us know if you need more . " The East Bay doctors next turned to the ticklish problem of malpractice , and the widespread belief that , physicians were conspiring to protect their incompetent colleagues against exposure and punishment . " Too many people are convinced that it is impossible to get one doctor to testify against another , " said Water-son . " We ca n't go before the public with our story until we can guarantee that patients are protected from gross incompetence , carelessness and fee-minded doctors . " The association already had a medical committee on malpractice . To this committee they added a layman ? Rev. Paul Reagor , former pastor of one of the biggest churches in the county  --  to act as an observer for the public . Instead of asking an expert . to testify for one side or the other , they appointed special investigators with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings . " Once the facts are in , the whole committee votes on the appropriate action to he taken , " the Reverend Reagor says . " If there has been any covering up for guilty physicians , I certainly have never seen it . That committee is usually tougher than I 'd he myself . " The committee soon discovered that most malpractice claims were the result of an unfortunate misunderstanding . and could be handled quickly by a tactful explanation . Sonic could be classified only as blackmail or nuisance suits , and the committee announced it would fight these adamantly through every court in the land . But when real malpractice was detected , the committee immediately offered the patient additional medical or surgical care to repair the damage , or a cash settlement , or both . Offending doctors were censured , and repeated offenders had their malpractice insurance is policy doctors carry to protect themselves against Patients ' suits ) canceled . To date , however , the committee has found no way to expel incompetents from the society , or to remove their licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licenses can he granted and revoked not by medical societies , but only by the state government itself . By 1949 the East Bay doctors had solved some of the most obvious and pressing of their problems . The solutions were not airtight or completely perfect in every case , yet they represented a distinct improvement . But the doctors felt that doctor-patient relationships could be improved still more . With funds supplied by the California Medical Association , and the backing of Dr. H. Gordon MacLean , soon to become president of the Witte group , they hired an expert to give t Item a hand . The expert was Dr. Ernest Dichter , of New York , who described himself as a " pmfessional disillutiinniet . " One of the lop industrinl psychologists in the country , he had previously been retained by such firms as 1 he Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company , t he Columbia Broadcaeting System and the Book-of-the-Month Club to study t heir customer relationships . " It was exciting to work with those doctors , " he staid . " They wanted to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came to Alameda Cou:ty and talked to physicians , patients , nurses , hospital managers , interns and medical students . He found out what patients thought about doctors , what doctors thought about patients and what doctors thought about other doctors . At the end he presented his findings in the form of a diagnosis , which Waterson and a committee of physicians then used as the basis of treatment , a prescription urging changes in many phases of doctor-patient relationships : No more talking down to patients as " mere laymen . " No more bouncing the patient from specialist to specialist ? a technique politely known as " referring the case . " No more needless delays in the doctor 's waiting room . No more telling the patient to " come any time from two to live " ? which often meant coming at two o'clock and waiting until five . No more false delicacy about finances , no saying " My nurse makes all the arrangements about t he bill , " and no more apologizing for the right of a doctor to charge a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as his skill . It was also recommended that the family doctor  --  a term which has often come to mean a man who is n't quite so talented as a specialist ? should be replaced by a personal physician , " either a general practitioner or a specialist , who can act as a general manager for all medical services . The personal physician should never " refer " his patient to a surgeon , for example , hut , if necessary , he should enlist a surgeon to join the team : he should discuss the treatment and prole able fee with both surgeon and patient , follow through by visiting the patient during the surgeon 's I real mint , get progress reports , fire the surgeon if the latter is not satisfactory , rind , in allot serve as " the patient 's own representative to and for medicine . " And finally the Dichter report , which is now considered by many authorities as a milestone in its field , called for a radical change in doctors ' bills . " Neither patient nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " it was claimed . " This is biological blackmail . The price should be placed on the value of the services rendered . " The East Bay doctors , along with some leaders of the California Medical Association , had long accepted this concept , and the Dichter report served as a potent stimulus to transform the idea into a practical program . They worked for months with union leaders , insurance experts , statisticians , hospital executives and individual physicians to iron out the details . Finally , in 1953 , they were ready for an experimental run . The area they selected was a portion of Contra Costa County , which had recently joined with Alameda to form the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association . " We 're not merely willing to try it , we must try it , " said one Contra Costa physician . " We 've got trouble here . " The trouble concerned a few incorrigible doctors who were apparently gouging on patients with **25;126;TOOLONG policies . One such patient was a waitress who had undergone an operation for which the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to he all right , " she said . " The health-insurance policy I have with my union was going to pay me eighty-live dollars , and all I 'd have to put out extra would he fifteen dollars , But the minute that surgeon found how much the insurance would pay , he raised his price to a hundred and fifty . If that 's the way the doctors do it , I want the Government to take over medicine . " To halt this kind of extortion , the doctors voted by a 3-to-i majority to institute what is now called the " usual-fee plan , " They first reported their individual fees for some 900 different medical and surgical procedures . Then these individual prices were analyzed and II list was set up for the entire area , based on the fee most commonly charged for each procedure . A routine office visit , for example , was $5 , a standard house call $7.50 , an appendectomy $200 , a tonsil operation for a child $60. and a normal delivery $125 . And finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee unless they first obtained the patient 's agreement . Any patient charged more than the going rate without this prior agreement would , if necessary , be defended in court . " This puts the matter right out in the open , where it should he , " declared Dr. , James Graeser , who was then president of the association . " The final decision must be up to the patient . Once he knows what the price will be , he can decide to accept it or go to another doctor . But he must know the price first . " In the past fifteen months the usual-fee plan  --  with its guarantee of enforcement  --  has proved so successful that it is spreading to other California counties . It now has been approved , at least in principle , by more than 2000 doctors who serve nearly 2,000,000 people . Not every doctor has endorsed it , and some still denounce it as an abominable variety of compulsion , but apparently most doctors and most patients have given the program their enthusiastic approval . Representatives of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , and many of them are developing similar programs for their own communities . Last June , at the AMA convention in San Francisco , Dr. Edward J. McCormick , of Toledo , Ohio ? then retiring as president of the association ? said . " The profession should consider the creation of average-fee lists or fee schedules that would prevail on an area or regional basis for the vast majority of cases . " The old " Robin Hood " method of " soaking the rich to help the poor , " he told the AMA 's policy-making House of Delegates , has outlived its usefulness , it is irritating to the public , it is responsible for some scandalously high doctor bills , and it is threatening to make a sham out of voluntary health insurance . The time has passed . he said , when a doctor can properly boost his usual fee merely because the patient ? or the patient 's insurance company  --  can afford to pay a higher price . Doctor McCormick emphasized that the problem can not be solved simply by setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Those of our members who fail to co-operate , who overcharge and who add to their bills over and above the reasonable fees determined , should be called before the grievance committees of their local societies to show cause why they should not be suspended or expelled , " he said . Last spring the continuing program in the Alameda-Contra Costa Medical Association was entrusted to William Scheuher , Waterson 's former assistant , and Waterson is currently working with other county and state medical groups . To him , the success of this new look in medicine is just what should have been expected . " Most doctors are wonderful men who want to do the right thing for their patients , " he said . " Now they 've finally realized that ' doing the right thing ' means they must also protect patients against the few doctors who are incompetent or dishonest , and who are smirching the reputation of the entire medical profession .
