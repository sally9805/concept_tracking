txt came at the end of one of the most blistering speeches he ever has delivered ? one in which he scathingly attacked Gen. Douglas as well as Senator Joseph R. McCarthy ( R ) of Wisconsin , and others who have engaged in what he called a " political smear campaign " against Secretary of State Deal Acheson and military leaders . On the first anniversary of the Korean war , Mr. Truman asserted that " it 's time that smear campaign was stopped . " He demanded that the " dividers and confusers " cease " playing fast and loose with the security of the nation in a time of great peril . " In reply to Mr. Malik . the President said the United States is " ready to join in a peaceful settlement in Korea now as we have always been  --  but it must be a real settlement which fully ends the aggression and restores peace and security to the area and to the gallant Korean people . " " In Korea and in the rest of the world we must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world peace . But we must avoid like the plague rash actions which would take unnecessary risks of world war or weak actions which would reward aggression , " he said . " We must be firm and consistent and level-headed . If we get discouraged or impatient , we can lose everything we are working for . If we carry on with faith and courage , we can succeed . " Critics Assailed It seemed likely that these statements were added to the President 's address after Mr. Malik ' made his proposal . The White House delayed issuance of advance text to newspapermen after the Russian spoke out June 23 . Mr. Truman indicated that he would consider an end of the war at the 38th parallel a victory for the United Nations . He said the forces of aggression in Korea had " been thrown back on their heels ? they are back behind the line they started from . " Then he swung into a denunciation of his foreign-policy critics and those who want the United States to " go it alone . " Mr. Truman named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was referring to General , Senator McCarthy , and other Republicans who , he charged , " have launched a campaign to destroy the trust and confidence of the people in their government . " " They are trying to set the people against the government by spreading fear and slander and lies , " he said . " They have attacked the integrity of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . They have maliciously attacked Gen. ( Omar N. ) Bradley , who is one of the greatest soldiers this country ever produced . " They have tried to besmirch the loyalty of Gen. ( George C. ) Marshall , who directed our strategy in winning the greatest war in history . They have deliberately tried to destroy Dean Acheson ? one of the greatest secretaries of state in our history . " Senator McCarthy delivered a 60,000-word attack on General Marshall Oply 10 days ago , accusing him of being part of a " conspiracy " to make the United States fall victim to Soviet , intrigue . Mr. Truman denied charges by General and others that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Far East . ' Partisan efforts to label our foreign policy as ' appeasement , ' to tag it as a policy of ' fear ' or ' timidity , ' point to only one thing , " he said . " They point to our ' going it alone ' down the road toward World War III . " Points to Alternatives " And look at the alternatives these critics have to present , " he went on , in obvious reference to testimony before the senate committee investigating the ouster of General . " Here is what they say : " Take a chance on spreading the conflict in Korea . Take a chance on tying up all our resources in a vast war in Asia . Take a chance on losing our allies in Europe . Take a chance the Soviet Union wo n't fight in the Far East . Take a chance we wo n't have a third world war .
