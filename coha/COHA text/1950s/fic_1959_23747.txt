The Man who gave up Pleasure By HERBERT GOLD Drawings by John Groth W HOP Cal Janus and me . What ? That war . When ? 1943 . Where ? Fort Bragg , North Carolina ; Why ? II'hy ? We all wanted the pleasure of survival . Cal Janus wanted only to be good . On the one hand , there was sweet Cal Janus ; on the other , the rest of the world . Together they conspired to teach me something about the fickle dream of pleasure , the fickle dream of integrity , and here is how and why . Cal was a long stringy old man of thirty who had studied for preacher , Iost the call , and then took to peddling high-school textbooks for a living , ( " Theodore Roosevelt was unhealthy in his early life , but later learned to carry a big stick and surmounted adversity and thus became President due to his excellent stubborn Dutch forebears . . . . " " How many bears ? " ) This commerce seemed as far from virtue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dirty business  --  you pay the school-hoards in cigars , unction , and cash . Cal got tense . sick , looked as if he were stood up by the tendons of his neck ; he enlisted although his wife said she needed him at home with their two kids and her belly swollen up over the third ? " You remember that day Claraiou had the grippe and you caught me in the bathroom looking for the thermometer , honey ? " Frequently these dry sad skinny girls never stop having kids ; maybe it 's all that ever makes them smile and they claim it 's no extra trouble to stir up the waffle mix at Sunday breakfast for one more mouth . You make it with sour milk , and you make the milk by letting it stand on the back porch . We were still at Fort Bragg in the 100th Infantry Division . That made nobody laugh lik ? real laughing , though Tech Sergeant Stamp hawed . Red sand , chiggers , fungus , Sergeant Stamp , drill , and fatigue were our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , ready on the left , ready on the fi-ring line . . . For our only recess in the soldier 's school we went into Fayetteville , which the New York boys called Fagleburg , in order to drink ( easy ) , wench ( routinely difficult ) , and sip coffee at the USO 54 THE MAN WHO GAVE UP PLEASURE ( almost impossible ) . That last moiling effort was for kids like me : the mothers at the USO watched us with misty half-erotic eyes , because we were so young , so soft beneath our sullen carapaces , so tender and lost , while we were wondering how to get in with their daughters . Foxes they were , those sentimental mothers , they sent their nice downy girls to Winston-Salem for purposes of school , learning French and piano and achieving contraception . Well , in those days I was as busy as a bird which thinks of alighting but does not alight in its nest . I hovered with liberating indecision , I swooped and beadily looked , and the more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more I sympathized with my own labors . Raise targets ! Raise targets ! At eighteen 1 overestimated everything : love ( by which I meant straining dreams of sex with Laura , the girl I left behind at the bus station in Ann Arbor ) , the war ( by which I meant getting into a cloak-and-dagger school , or at least the paratroops ) , friendship with Mike ( 1 had a friend to confide in  --  long philosophical letters ) , and so on . I admit that friendship , love , and the war could have had other objects , too . Fire ! At will ! FIRE ! C A L showed me how to level my cheek to the stock and play against the recoil on the shoulder . I oiled the wood to bring out the grain , and with my cheek so many times against it , I learned kittenish love for the M-1 rifle of those days . All these efforts made me pale and tense beneath the dark muscular hardness put on by infantry training under the Carolina sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the pain of preparing to kill , and my body below absorbed abuse almost . without hurt . At present its flittering ambition confined itself to Army matters ; the world narrowed toward the red sands of North Carolina  --  true love on the streets of Fayetteville , where nice girls cowered behind triple locks before being shipped away . I dreamed of saving the life of the green-eyed daughter of one of the town 's leading citizens , sensuously kicking her from the path of a runaway truck , rolling with her in the dust , coming to my feet with the kind of decorative spots and wounds with which the make-up artists accent the cheekbones of movie heroes . Her esteemed father would say , " Ah do thank you kinely , suh . Yo-all is a gennleman albeit a nawthunah . Now spread yo legs nicely fob de soklja boy , honeychile . He ai n't like that tray-ish , he speak seben languages includin de Sanskrit and also inter alia and postum factory ( Al had a fine upbringing in Little Latin and Lesser Greek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remembah , " said her pappy the distinguished scholar and leading citizen of Fagleburg , " this heah damyankec done save you lah-eel . " " He read Tolstoy , play strong tennis , have poetic burning eyes set me aflame , too , " remarked Honeychile , gradually recovering from the shock of informal introduction . " Here , Yankee , let me take your arm . . . " Montage of real , confiding , talkative love ; C  --  sar Franck under . How Laura , who had girlishly practiced at making me jealous , would suffer ! I diluted the dream with jokes in order to make it serve for sixteen hours of potwashing . On the second day of KP , Honeychile failed me ; my heroic love of her did not seem energetic enough . I broke open a new box of Brillo and found a new fantasy . Then down I float-float-floated , by parachute billowing into occupied France . There I was known as Monsieur l'Americain , leading the fanatic maquis warriors in foolhardy but always phenomenally murderous and successful nighttime raids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard growing fierce and black although my actual Fort Bragg beard was thin and reddish and mediocrely stimulated by constant electric shaving . At night , of course , Fillette , the tavern keeper 's winsome daughter , black bangs and contralto , crept like a little squirrel into my heart and sack . In this potwashing serial dream , we spoke high-school French until a section which was too sincere for foreign parlez-vows , whereupon Fillette switched over to English with a tart , breathy French accent . Incidentally , that was her figure of speech about creeping like a little squirrel through my ribs . I would never be guilty of such an impractical , morbid , oral-aggressive metaphor . She pronounced my name , Burr Fuller , as if it were " Bair . . . my leetle kureuil , my little wan , " and I could n't have been loved more eloquently in Beverly Hills . So much for the manly , educated-in-America dream lite of a soljur boy . The accepted way to get through an Army is to behave with cunning and be dazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus not so cunning as I might have been ; but there are advantages . I kept on with my life . A man loses reality to himself if he 's dazed ( everybody knows that ) , but also if he is perfectly subtle and efficient . Back to Cal Janus again . Cal was a very wild odorous onion , a living creature more fantastic than Honeyebile or Fillette , and thus he drew me gently back into the world . How grateful l am ! Fillette refreshed me , Horteychile comforted , but Cal Janus was there . He taught me lessons . He looked at me kindly . More and most : he was my friend . I 'm confident that the extraordinary personality  --  virtuous , excellent , however you call it  --  is not merely odd . Extreme excellence never wears a proper hat , but the extraordinary personality is not merely queer . He must be an exaggeration of the best in men , of the best in what we have in common . I guess he is the most radical argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a saint  --  he was excellent but both saintly and as wild as a criminal . An abuser of life . His trouble was that he could enjoy nothing . He took no pleasure . He had no ease . The men liked him , the officers liked him , even Sergeant Stamp liked him okay : his physical length and authority might have made him a noncom , had he wanted stripes . There was no embarrassment in the man . He had none of the personal unease ( shyness of desire ) which bedevils for example me . It was all general , abstract , absolute . There was a war on , and that was a final statement , He could enjoy nothing . " Let 's take in a movie , " I said one day when we went to Fayetteville on pass . He replied with this question , which I sum : ? marine : When men are dying every day , when children are being tortured , when our world is probably coining to an end , how can you pleasure yourself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl ? How can you look at the maps in the newspaper , where each heavy line represents thousands of deaths , and then smile at a new joke ? " Hmm , " I would say , half convinced by him , " yes , but look how my blister is healing . There 's the body . It goes on anyway . The metabolism recognizes health , and good food or fun is healthy for our bodies , no matter what happens in the jungles or on the eastern front ? " " Disloyalty , " he said . " No , Cal , loyalty to the dead who were unwilling to give up life . " " Disloyalty , " he said mournfully . Yet he was not an angry preacher . He stood too far away to care about our sinning  --  therefore further than God , who is said to care , I told him , though Cal 's body , like human mine , was full of fat and blood and air and quaking with the works of lust and digestion . Ordinarily he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I argued . " The dead  --  we continue their desire , we express our solidarity with them by having a good time .. . " he waited until my voice thinned away and my shame caught up with me . It did and does , though I believe more than ever that we must continue to desire . But Cal forced me to see the other possibility for faith , the solidarity of suffering . We walked through town . I felt like a forgiven thief  --  really forgiven and emboldened . In the meantime , while the summer shower just over put a mist at our ankles , and the washing shriveled on the lines in the Negro neighborhood through which we passed , and salt marks appeared on our khaki shirts , and the air of Fayetteville had been laved for a time by the rain , Cal condemned himself to a perpetual mourning for all sinning mankind . " Your way lies vegetarianism , " I said . " Implications . Things are always dying , suffering . dying . When you walk . you step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with earthworms , very interesting . This kind of discussion we had in the college cafeteria last year . " " You want to make me a fanatic , - he said . " Why insist ? I do n't worry about ants or even anthills  --  they do n't have our nervous receptors , if you like those words . I 'm talking about men . 56 THE MAN WHO GAVE UP PLEASURE about millions of human beings with terrible receptors , about civilization . " " Same thing , brother . Life is ever a jungle . Strength for the struggle and sorrow . I was saying . Forgive my elegance . " " I know you mean it , " he said , and brought me down again . " Yes I do , Cal . But I 'm sorry , I 'm a tilde exalted today . GI coffee made of Stamp 's shoes . " But I was brought down anyway . I did n't like it . " Struggle and sorrow , " I pronounced , kidding , but it came out merely vague mourning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look from the great height of his neck . He had a long prickly furrowed stalk out of his collar like a red desert cactus . The pods of alley flowers were spilling onto . cracking , steaming mud ; we stooped under that ferny bush , green and dusty , which seems to . live only in poverty ? the Tree of Heaven it 's called . It showered the last flecks of rain on our shoulders ; a black kid had leaned from a window to give it the shake . Cal grinned at the kid , but when he looked at me the grin . vanished . " Do n't put me in a box , " he said . " I accept as much of life as I can . I 'm not even a pacifist ? I wo n't keep myself from killing while others are condemned to kill for me . No , no . But Ijust ca n't see wenching while millions of men are groaning for their wives . No , for sure not . " " And when you 're on furlough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce bloodshot look . With the same brutal and gentle confidence in his justice , he said , " All right , and 1 ca n't do it with her anymore , either . How could I ? Not while this ugliness and rape goes on . " Boy that I was , shameless as I Was , such naked revelation made me blush . In perpetual jealous curiosity about the steady bed luxuries of couples who never worried about being caught , I heard this dizzy confession . To refuse what they had all right to ! No tipping porch swing , no dusty garage mattress , no park police to foil ! Gee whiz , he was sainted for sure . Cal had it : he was and he really was a saint , though he smelled of sweat like the rest of us , had a row of blemishes where his belt rubbed against his middle , groaned at Sergeant Stamp . My shame and being touched happened also because he suddenly seemed simple as a child ? " ca n't do it " ? although he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furrows , wrinkles , tired pouched eyes , but : " Did you do it last night ? We did it " ? that childish word for love . Cal loved with too powerful a generality to do any-FAIRLIGHT by Robert Brittain ( Sussex coast ) THIS is a place . I dreamed when Oklahoma , red-earthed and rolling , six hundred miles from a sea , was all I knew ; and the only thing white like foam breaking along the . crest of a hummock of salt-water was a wild-plum thicket in bloom . That , too , breasted the rises , so ? that if I could have seen it from the top of the biggest cottonwood tree it might have looked something the way tho blown froth looks from here . Oklahoma lifts nothing a boy can climb to come where chalk downs turn on a white heel from a wind-run sea . Yet this is a place I dreamed : the same solidity to stand on . ( though mine was granite , as I remember ) and the same . triumphant distance above the questionings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are after . And whether it 's branches or promontories they reach eventually is no great matter , seeing that ocean lifts the same profusion of wild-plum blossom as prairie , and petals float as mackerel scales of foam where the wind runs in the squid-shaped wake of the breakers . thing about love in the way ' of particular yearning action . A trickle running down a furrow of his neck vanished before it reached his collar . It was as if he gave off a dry heat . Cal was moral with a bewildering twist  --  absolutely moral . He did not moralize until I drove him to it . He did his soldiering jobs , then sat up nights in the latrine , reading newspapers , unable to sleep and burning out every little spoor of fat still hiding on his scarecrow body . Some crazy fake saints in cafeterias go clipping in the papers for more examples of the perversity of men . Cal simply mourned . When we took up as buddies , Cal was willing to do what a kid wanted , gallop through Fagleburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took aspirin like air , but he did n't complain . He knew how to laugh , too . I like ham sandwiches with Cole slaw on it . At a delicatessen in town I asked for one and got a ham sandwich with a dish of cote slaw . With the stubbornness of a new enlistee upholding the policy of unconditional surrender in North Carolina , I sent it back . " Oti the sandwich , " I said . " On the sandwich ? " the waitress drawled . " On , " I repeated . She carried it back to the kitchen , and returned with a haggard expression , having dumped the dish of cote slaw over the sandwich . A small relief in our life of drill and kitchen duty , but I laughed and so did Cal . Not that he liked to enjoy the incident , but he recognized that it was funny . He was so saintly that he could admit being human . He took it as duty to me . I needed his laughter to ease mine out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howled , hall in pain , like an Arab singer . Within this dry bean lay soft plump mouth parts , folded . S U L L E N shoving trainees filled the streets ; there was no strolling ( do n't you know there 's a war on ? ) ; we went into a bar . This was something my saintly friend could accept  --  anesthesia . That is. he did n't enjoy it , but it gave him relief from his constant headaches and from the great headache of war and suffering . He took a whore on his knee and made general love to her , with words only , chink of bottles and hollow cough of empty draft-beer spigot , while she bounced on his lap to take his mind off conversation and give him surcease of cash . " Ah honey , " said the girl . " You-all want to go with me ? " She was a tired , thin , very younggirl with tiny , unformed , childish nose , mustached mouth , and sweet hardening eyes . lipstick on her healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were seeds in the smear of jam hardening on her blouse . She was dead-ending fast . She pretended to need men , but really did . She was fit subject for Cal 's pity and I wondered how he would pity her . " Vail do n't wan na go with me , honey ? " she asked . " As the compass yearns to the north , " he said . " Your boy homesick for the nawth ? " She looked at me pouted . " He crazy-ass crazy or only nuts ? Your buddy-boy a soldier or ai n't he ? " Being a bit imbued myself , I answered her with a song I had been reading in the splits and serrations of the table : I love you in the evening , That just alcohol talking , just talk . I love you in the morning And tell me your dreams , I 'll tell you mine , And help me my trouble , I 'll help you yours  --  Thai love . " You 're no good , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yore buddy . He nice . " What impressed this girl was that Cal was polite , he was friendly , he was tender ; but in fact he was indifferent to her as a specific , sad , camp-town whore . He did not see her  --  this she took for gentlemanly charm and dignity , and crooked her little finger to be worthy of him . Cal had no sense of his wife , he had no sense of her , he had no sense of me . Like the girl , he was fast losing his self . In the meantime he sweated and anguished , glistering with drink and a closing light . He smiled , he was kind , the girls liked him although they felt that he did n't care : he made no pretense , he talked at them and bought drinks but that was all . A hungry pain in his head . The quickest element was being husked and eaten . This happened many times . Then he went back to camp , took an aspirin , fell asleep , woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning read the papers . Death , death , death . If it was Saturday he took his aspirin and went out to duty . No hangover , no pleasure , nothing . But the war lay on his brain like an eating sore . Murder . Cal was my friend . He felt my ignorance as innocence and we were joined by our varieties of absolutism  --  mine passing , I think , his coming upon him more and more fully . An addiction to absolute cleanness . This thing about justice and truth is no virtue when it comes on like an undiagnosed tropical fever , unclean , 58 THE MAN WHO GAVE UP PLEASURE undefined , and complicated . And worst of alldejuicing . It feeds ; it concentrates ; and when it eats through a body , it leaves thickened skin , a pale stiff rind . Devotion without faith ! Pah ! But Cal took care of me . He believed in the idea of evil  --  also was Xtian  --  good . Despite headache and fever , he even wanted to sneak over and fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furloughed , but I would not let him wash over me all the way with his saintliness . No , no . Strong virtue , yes , but down with the sublime  --  it is not of this earth . Let him be Jesus if he insisted , and die for my sins ; let him not wash my pots and pans . He would not receive my co-operation in this enterprise . It was bad enough to have him stand by me , saying , " Are you willing for things to go on like they are ? " " Why ask the question , Cal ? That 's one for the girls who listened to Berlioz up at college . Are you happy , Dotty-Jean ? ' " " But I want to know . " " Sure you want . But still you ca n't get a quick yes or no between changing the records . It is n't up to us to give final answers . " " I know , " he murmured with a smile suspending his long , glistening , unhealthy jaw . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned a rest . Everybody . Me too . Sometimes . " And the smile was almost peaceful on that thrilled , troubled face . There was no need to ask if now he was happy . He was not . Nor content to be alive . He had no place in his metabolism for the misery of this world of murder , hatred , war , spittle on mouths . We had seen a photograph of an SS man cutting off the beard of a fierce old Jew . The German who points his scissors at the Jew 's mouth has a handsome heavy face under his helmet , he smiles , his skin is good , his teeth white , regular ; other soldiers stand nearby , some laughing , a very young one with glasses and a dreamy look  --  he could be thinking of his mother or his girl . But there is spittle on his mouth . Cal could not give the fact of bestiality anything but exclusive sovereignty over his own will . He did not exactly complain . He smiled , griped like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy who folded it into his wallet . He went along , drank like a good soldier . He did as he was told , only slept less . The authority of his contempt for life was felt , however , but not as contempt . His sleeplessness was a wonder . He powered himself by fever . He was liked . He wanted nothing from anyone , so they made him corporal at last . He sewed on the stripes because it was expected ofhim . He accepted jealous congratulations as if they were generous expressions of good will . Then he forgot and everyone forgot . He carried a Browning Automatic Rifle . It killed faster . It made no difference . So he did n't care about eating , but ate . He did n't care about drinking , but drank . He did n't care about women , but was a good fellow to them . He also did n't care about you or me , but was kind . His headaches got worse . The war got worse . His worries got worse . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked him . " No , but I can stand to think about it , " he said . " I feel the war behind the fuzz if I take enough aspirin . Without aspirin , I do n't have the fuzz . " lie began to have very pink eyes . The straight , strong , soldier 's calm passed . The glistering sweat that I noticed when he dandled the whore on his lap kept him busy during training , too . Not a heavy sweat of drill under the Carolina sun . It was a thin , slippery nerve sweat . He did n't complain . " I do n't feel well , " he said , but it was not complaint . " How many dead today ? How many tomorrow ? How many dying every single day of this war ? " " No one wants to kill them . " " We do . " " We have to . " " Fools . Some like it . I wish , " he said , and I listened to him without diagnosis because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease because : how else to see a man ? " I wish I were in the lines . " A sensible person would have received enough signs already , but not me . His eyes were filmed over with an eye equivalent of his sick sweat . W E WERE out for a field problem on a day of pure heat . The shadow of pine down the ravine seemed white with sun . Every foot in the company was swollen in its boot ; our heads were cooking in helmet ovens . Even a carrion bird would have given up , closed shop on such meat . There were no birds , no rodents ; pinching beasties , flies , ants , mites , chiggers aplenty . Ten minute break . Feet on packs , head in dust . Shuffle , scratch , undo canteens . " Nobody drinks the water ! Nobody drinks till the command ! Nobody drinks the water ! Captain 's orders ! " This yell went up and down the ranks . Groans . " Everything by the numbers , " someone said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the tonsillitis , he wo n't listen . " " He only carries a carbine . Empty pack , no gas mask , no M-1 . " Our legs were tired and our eyes were gritty and our backs were hoisted out of shape and our self-respect was covered with wounds , and with difficulty we put ourselves together enough to wish rare Oriental diseases upon the captain . " He should have the tonsillitis and see what I would do for him , " Logan said after a long thoughtful silence . " I 'd ? " But he decided to give the captain more thought . In our various voices we all called him by that favorite military epithet  --  Oedipus Rex . " They had baked Alaska at the officers ' mess hall last . Saturday . We had prune pie , " Fred Brand said . " What the hell is baked Alaska ? " " Cooked crntty ice cream . " " Poo . No wonder he ai n't thirsty . " I crawled next to Cal and said , " It helps if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cal opened his canteen and spilled his water on the ground . " Who wants to drink anyway ? " he asked me . I watched it rustling into the red sand , twice the speed of gravity , straight humming down , vanishing . I bugged with an effort to draw it up by pure eyepowcr . Our tongues swollen andcoated , we were waiting for the order that would permit us to drink . Cal had a worried , thoughtful line between his eyes . " Why did you do that ? " I asked him . " What do I deserve it for ? The captain is correct . What right have we ? The boy shot in the stomach is dying of thirst , I know , I know . Cal Janus does not need to drink the water . " He was quiet and undemonstrating now . Finally I thought of going to somebody and saying , I 'm worried about Corporal Janus . Whom could I tell ? What could I tell ? That he denied himself comfort ? That he refused to screw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war troubled him so he lived on aspirin ? Go jerk off , they would have asked me please to do . If Sergeant Stamp had raised a question , okay ; but at last some of the sergeant 's dislike for me was beginning to spread toward my buddy , Janus , that old man of thirty . The sergeant could n't find a hold for working him over , of course ; CaI simply paid him no mind . He cared for nothing . He gave up pleasure . He no longer had dreams , he said , neither good nor bad ones . They suggested the possibility of pleasure , even the bad ones . He stayed awake . He stopped writing to his wife . He thought only of the inexorable crunch of 60 THE MAN WHO GAVE UP war , the murder of men upon the murder of men . " But people are always dying ! " I protested . " Disease , age , aecident ? " " Abortion , crime , the waste of nature ? " " Yes ! Stop your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gypsy who made the nails sharp so that they would hurt less as they penetrated the palms of Jesus . " Get wise ! Get with it ! " And a secret smile crossed his face . " It 's unjust , " he said , " I wo n't admit it . " " Admit it ? " " 1 know it happens . i wo n't allow it . " " But it does n't depend on you , Cal ! " And again that secret smile across the sick lestroyed face of a soldier who no longer wrote to his wife because of the joy it gave him to hear from her . He had no rights . Other soldiers were dying without hearing from their wives . " Think of her ! " I protested . " Think of your children . " And for the third time in a few minutes there was that sneaky whiplash of smile striking my friend in the face , a smile from elsewhere . What was happening was a partial , worser death . A soul which was in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when you call to it . He was transformed that day into a debris of suffering , suffering without cry of pain , a twisting and crawling of the nerves . The long face grew as greasy as that of a fat man . Reads of sweat ran off the grin , ran into the black glare of had teeth ; he spoke nonsense , grinding a broken stump of tooth , saying , " Nothing , nothing , nothing " ; he was led off to sick call . " Tell me what 's the matter , " I pleaded with him . " Do you want some water ? " What else could I give him ? " I 'm sick , Burr , I 'm sick sick sick sick . " " What hurts , Cal ? Where do you hurt ? " " Si-ickt " he shouted , and paused , cocking his head to listen for an echo off the dispensary walls , and then there was no echo and he PLEASURE laughed . It was a laugh . but it was not an ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a lighter than air spirit slipping away , a retreat by ascension . This laugh had no mouth parts in it . I shivered . He chuckled and whispered to me , " But my head still hurts . " There were orderlies taking him . He had been noticed by someone ; he had made himself seen by authority at last . " Oh my head . Oh my poor little headache . " A F E W men watched as he was led from the dispensary to an ambulance . They would not let me go along , but I ran after to the hospital . They had given him a sedative by the time I got there . He lay curled and groggy on a cot . The shadow across his face was met by death 's darker shadow soaking from beneath the skin . The doctors were watching him with the baffled , slightly angry , bureaucratic look of interns faced by something not in the hooks . Or not in the books they had read . An orderly stood by , but Cal made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he was crooning to himself . He was bent as if he wanted to put his head between his knees . " How do you feel , Cal ? " " I had no right . The war took it away . I had no chance . " " No chance for W ha t , Cal ? " No answer . " We 'll have lots of fun yet , Cal . " " No , nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing . " He was slimy with his inward shock . There was nothing to see on his face but the black fixed stumps of grin and the headache . I thought of his fear of pleasure when the doctor later told me brain tumor . They operated ; they found a rapid fibrous mass like a split carrot over that magic sponge ; he died . This created a new problem for me . Some of the men who had noticed him now said that his enthusiasm for peace and brotherhood , his self-sacrifice , his inability to take pleasure while others were suffering , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . In other words , this nutty idealism was mere nuttiness . Is idealism a brain tumor ? Does it necessarily kill a man ? I had the chance to try its opposite , the no-brain tumor , once we fought up to Paris . In the meantime , poor Cal , he died of it . He died of what killed him , but he was a good soul , and have we the right to turn our backs on his symptoms of virtue for being so irregularly caused ?
