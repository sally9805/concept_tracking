As he does once each year , the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. ' s stooped , bushy-browed President Leroy Alton Lincoln last week invited reporters to discuss his company 's annual report over lunch in his leather-paneled executive dining room . As boss of the world 's biggest life insurance company , he had some impressive figures to give them . In 1949 , said Lincoln , Metropolitan had boosted its assets 6% to a mammoth $9.7 billion . It had not yet overtaken the world 's biggest corporation-American Telephone &; Telegraph , whose assets total $10.8 billion-but it was on its way . In 1950 's first two months , said Lincoln proudly , Metropolitan had sold more group insurance than in the entire previous year . A big reason : it had just signed a contract with Bethlehem Steel Corp . for a $325 million blanket policy covering 107,000 workers . <P> Such good news made a fitting valedictory for 69-year-old Leroy Lincoln , who , at year 's end , after 15 years as president , will step up to chairman. * To reporters he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , 66 . Unlike President Lincoln , who joined the Metropolitan as a lawyer in 1918 , President-designate Taylor has been in the business for 50 years . <P> Bloody Ground . The eldest son of a Scottish immigrant , Virginia-born Charles Taylor wanted to be an electrical engineer but , unable to afford college , switched to insurance " because I could work with figures . " He rose to the vice presidency of Richmond 's South Atlantic Life Insurance Co. , went to Metropolitan as a Lincoln protege in 1932 . " I thought I would be able to retire early , " he said last week . <P> " Here I am an old man , and still working . " In its 82 years , the Metropolitan has had only six presidents . It began as the National Union Life and Limb Insurance Co. , formed to insure the lives of soldiers &; sailors fighting in the Civil War , was still getting organized when the Union Army lost 17,287 men at the battle of Chancellorsville . Result : the company collapsed . It reorganized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It got another bad jolt in the 1918 flu epidemic , when at the peak of the disaster , more than 5,000 claims a day were trundled into Metropolitan 's home office , loaded in huge wicker baskets . Metropolitan paid 68,000 death claims . <P> Happy Homes . Wars and epidemics now hold little terror for Metropolitan , which has so much cash that it has been forced to invent new ways of investing it . One of the most successful : its eight apartment house developments in New York , California and Virginia ( total capacity : 125,000 people ) , in which the Metropolitan has invested $300 million in 30 years . To Metropolitan 's 33 million individual policyholders , one of the most reassuring facts is that the company 's checks have long borne the signatures of Washington ( Lawrence , third vice president ) and Lincoln . Soon they will have to be content with Washington and Taylor . <P> <P> *Frederick H. Ecker , 82 , the present chairman , will become honorary chairman .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
