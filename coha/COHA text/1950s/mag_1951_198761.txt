THE MIRACULOUS BARBER ( 248 pp. ) - Marcel Aym - Harper ( $3 ) . <P> It is Paris in the uneasy spring of 1936 . Sitdowns close the factories , riots clog the streets , a Popular Front cabinet maneuvers for its life . To a Jules Remains or a Jean Paul Sartre this is the ideal setting for a lugubrious social novel . But not to Marcel Aym . As a satirist by profession - and currently the best in France-Aym gives 1936 France his usual deft , dry treatment . <P> Like The Barkeep of Blmont ( TIME , May 15 ) , Aym 's sardonic jab at the Resistance movement , The Miraculous Barber insists that even in times of historical crisis men display their customary capacity for making fools of themselves . <P> Picture on the Wall . Aym writes about two families , the solid upper-class Lasquins and the bohemian middle-class Ancelots . M. Lasquin , a hard-working industrialist , falls dead at lunch one day , between the trout and the duck with orange sauce . The death is rather ill-timed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take his place there ? His son-in-law Pierre is the natural candidate , but Pierre cares nothing for industry and responsibility , or , for that matter , for his pretty young wife , Micheline . Pierre dreams of being a track star , keeps a picture of the great runner Ladoumgue on his bedroom wall and , pointing to the picture , tells his frustrated wife every morning , " That 's a real man . " <P> Meanwhile , the rest of the family fiddle at their own futilities . Pierre 's wife has a tepid flirtation ; Mama Lasquin is pleasantly excited to discover that the departed Papa Lasquin has had a mistress ; Papa 's brother-in-law appropriates the mistress . <P> The Ancelots are lower down in the social scale , but just as disorganized . Papa Ancelot , a shoestring operator in the stock market , rails at his giddy daughters for going around with gigolos . But the daughters have found that they can distract Papa from his tirades by pushing him into the receptive arms of the housemaid . Mama and daughters work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming French revolution . One daughter guesses that 500,000 heads will fall . " I find the idea breathtakingly pure , " replies Mama Ancelot . <P> Fingers in the Air . In surface contrast to these two families , Aym brings in his barber , a self-satisfied sage who gives advice , in the name of France , to cabinet ministers after hours . " The Frenchman 's got no use for revolutions , " the barber says in one pronouncement . " What the Frenchman wants is to earn a comfortable living , eat well , drink well and enjoy himself . " But the cream of Author Aym 's jest is that his barber , his symbolic natural wise man , is a fool himself . <P> The barber 's head , in fact , is a windy forum through which all the conflicting ideas of prewar France chase each other , one after another . His final word of reassurance on the French General Staff : " While we were having a drink I noticed they all held their little fingers in the air , quite separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Agreed , but it 's by small signs of that kind that one knows the best people . "
