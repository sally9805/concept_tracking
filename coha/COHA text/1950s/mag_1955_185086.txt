Ever since a band of Scottish settlers discovered in 1812 that early-maturing varieties of wheat from their native highlands would grow and ripen in Manitoba 's short summers , the wheat crop has made the difference between prosperity or hard times for Canada 's three prairie provinces . Last week , with bins and elevators brimming from the fourth fine harvest in five years , the threat of acute financial crisis hung incongruously over the prairies . Reason : the inability of Canada 's National Wheat Board to sell the accumulated surplus at a price the farmers are willing to take . <P> Bin-Busting Crop . The trouble began to develop two years ago , when Canada exported only 41% of its bin-busting 614-million-bushel wheat crop instead of the usual 55%-60% . Rust and harvesttime rain cut last year 's crop to 309 million bushels , but exports again fell off sharply . Britain withdrew from the International Wheat Agreement , India and France began to grow more of their own grain as a matter of national policy , and Argentina , bouncing back from a year-long drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. , burdened with a giant surplus of its own , made other inroads into the world market through a series of bargain-price sales and disaster-relief gifts to such dollar-shy countries as Italy , Japan and Israel . Canada 's traveling wheat salesmen , unwilling to meet the competition with fire-sale price cuts , had tough going . When the 1954-55 crop year ended last July 31 , Canada 's stocks of wheat on hand stood at 494 million bushels-as much as the country could consume in three years , and 28% more than it had ever exported in its best year . <P> The National Wheat Board , the only agency permitted by law to export wheat or ship it across provincial boundaries , in August 1954 placed a limit of 300 bushels on the amount of new wheat it would accept from any farmer during the harvest season . But the harvest could not wait . In the finest autumn weather in years , giant combines cut wide swaths through fields of standing wheat , spewed out rivers of top-grade grain . Commercial elevators were soon chockablock . Farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat , built new barns to hold the flood , and when all the sheds were filled , piled their wheat in amber hillocks on the ground . When the harvest was in , Canada 's supply of wheat on hand stood at 992 million bushels * <P> Stopgap Plan . All across the prairies , farmers dug into savings for cash to meet their taxes , payments on land and farm machinery . In Sanford , Man. , the local credit union closed its books when the outstanding loans reached the legal limit . In Alberta farm towns , barter in livestock began to replace cash sales . In Saskatchewan , idle farmers swamped the National Employment Service with job applications . Last week the government offered a stopgap plan for the government to guarantee bank loans to farmers with stocks of unsalable grain . The scheme disappointed many farmers , who had hoped for straight cash advances on their crops . Meanwhile , Ottawa prepared to send a delegation of trade experts to Geneva this week to fight for renewal of the International Wheat Agreement and its system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale in wheat may start in earnest . <P> *The U.S. stock on hand : 1,279,000,000 bushels
