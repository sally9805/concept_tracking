As a poet , Robert William Service never sought the level of Percy Bysshe Shelley , would have been as out of place on Parnassus as Shelley in a Klondike saloon . The rhymes that made Service a millionaire w'ooed none of the nine Muses . They reek of male shenanigans and sweat , roar like a Yukon avalanche , teem with rude and lusty characters : Claw-Fingered Kitty , Chewed-Ear Jenkins . Muck-Luck Mag , Blasphemous Bill Mackie . Dangerous Dan McGrew . " Rhyming has my ruin been , " Robert Service once wrote , falling unconsciously into the balladeer 's inversion . " With less deftness I might have produced real poetry . " <P> Real poetry was not a part of " Wullie " Service 's spirit , or his life . Even as an English-born bank clerk in Glasgow , he dashed off doggerel for the weeklies , and burned with an adventurer 's ambition to make a million dollars , write 1,000 poems , and live for a century . In hot pursuit of these ends , he hopped a freighter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21-year-old fiddle-foot with a Scottish burr . He worked anywhere , at anything-swilling swine in British Columbia , tending roses for a San <P> Diego cathouse-and everywhere manufacturing verse . <P> Dangerous Dan . Lady Luck , who smiled on so many fortune seekers in the Yukon gold fields , smiled there too on Wullie Service . Behind his bank teller 's cage one frozen night in White Horse , he knocked out a raw , rollicking ballad called The Shooting of Dan McGrew , modestly tucked it away in his shirt drawer , months later , in 1907 , sent it to a Toronto publisher of church hymnals with a slender assortment of other sourdough rhymes . The story goes that the typesetters swung into a dance as they locked it in the forms . <P> Then I ducked my head , and the lights <P> went out , and two guns blazed in the <P> dark , <P> And a woman screamed , and the lights <P> went up , and two men lay stiff and <P> stark . <P> Pitched on his head , and pumped full <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man from the creeks lay <P> clutched to the breast of the lady <P> that 's known as Lou . <P> In one collection or another , Dangerous Dan grossed its author half a million dollars ; and another early Service ballad , The Cremation of Sam McGee , earned such widespread prominence that its real-life namesake ( whose name Service casually lifted from a bank ledger ) spent all the remaining days of his life parrying the question : " Is it warm enough for you , Sam ? " <P> These popular two ballads by themselves made Service rich . In successive books-Ballads of a Cheechako , Rhymes of a Rolling Stone , Lyrics of a Low Brow - he paid repeated respects to his own talents as a versifier and an avid public 's eagerness to read manly far northern rhymes such as these : <P> <P> This is the law of the Yukon , and ever <P> she makes it plain : <P> " Send not your foolish and feeble ; send <P> me your strong and your sane- <P> Strong for the red rage of battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Send me men girt for the combat , men <P> - who are grit to the core ; <P> Swift as the panther in triumph , fierce <P> as the bear in defeat , <P> Sired of a bulldog parent , steeled in the <P> furnace heat .
