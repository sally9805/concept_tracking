A factual ( except for names and addresses ) account of a determined courier , some top secret documents , and a flood in the wilds ( sic ! ) of Connecticut . THE rains which Hooded southern necticut in the fall of 1955 not threatened the lives and properties of the field county exurbanites but , in the estimation of one of the flood victims , Hans Fiedler , came close to endangering the lives and property of the 170,000,000 inhabitants of the United States and possibly those of the citizens of Western Europe as well . For Hans not only found himself marooned by the flood ; he found himself marooned with a trunk full of secret nuclear documents . As usual in recent meteorological history , the deluge which dumped up to eleven inches of rain on parts of Connecticut in a three-day tear completely surprised the weather forecasting authorities , and consequently the local authorities , and , of course , the unsuspecting residents . The Hood crested on Saturday in the communities along the northern shore of Long Island Sound . Hans Fiedler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this day , October 15 , returning home to 76 Hawthorne Place , Stamford , Connecticut , from his New York office , the American Atomic Products Company plant . The weather forecast which Hans had read in the morning papers predicted cloudiness with a chance of rain or drizzle , and while it was obviously raining at 5:00 P.M. when Hans started driving from New York City , he had no idea that this was anything more than a late summer shower . The weather bureau did have a further inkling as to the actual conditions and issued a forecast at 5:00 F.M . saying , " Cloudy with showers and some local flooding , and hazardous driving conditions . " At 5:30 P.M. the bureau began to realize the full seriousness of the situation and issued an amended forecast : " Rainy and windy tonight with rain occasionally heavy , causing local flooding and hazardous driving conditions . " Hans did not receive the last two predictions until the next day . When Hans left the city he had the trunk of his car loaded with forty-eight copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courier , " a man given the authority to transport secret information , and he was taking the documents from his office to his home where they were to be picked up the next morning by two other couriers . Before leaving , he called his wife , Foo , and asked her to have supper ready for him when he got home at seven o'clock . It was their anniversary and she had planned a supper of roast duck and champagne to celebrate . She put the duck in the oven , timing it so that it would be ready at seven . At seven o'clock Hans was stuck on the Hutchinson River Parkway near New Rochelle , New York . He still thought , although it was now raining very hard , that this was just a traffic jam . He did , however , decide that he had better phone his wife and tell her he would be late for supper . To do this he had to leave the parkway . He told Foo he was going home on the Boston Post Road instead of the parkway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she put the duck back in the oven . At first , Hans found driving along the Boston Post Road easier , although it was raining harder and getting quite dark . But at the edge of Greenwich he got stuck for an hour in another traffic jam . When he had a chance , he phoned Foo again and told her he was getting off the Post Road to take one of the back roads home . This was a route he often used when the Post Road was tied up . Foo took the duck off the table and put it back in the oven again . Hans was very familiar with the route he was taking , but he had some difficulty following it because it was so dark and raining so hard that the windshield wipers could not seem to break the sheet of water across the windshield . The amount of water on the road made it impossible to see the center line marker . All Hans had to do when he left the Post Road was to drive north for about a mile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a bridge only ten feet long . Then he would be just a half mile from home . But when he got to the corner at which he was to turn , his headlights dimly outlined a man in a yellow oilskin across the brook , waving traffic away . Hans cursed and turned left to circle back to the Post Road . If he had stopped to question the man in the slicker , he would have discovered that the bridge had been washed away about fifteen minutes before . A car with three occupants had been on the bridge when it happened . They were all drowned . The unfamiliar road Hans . found himself on quickly petered out into a damp dead end . He turned off onto another road which he was also forced to leave . He was having great difficulty by this time as the road was narrow , winding , unfamiliar , and invisible . He kept thinking , " Damn it . T do n't know where I am . " He had only one thing in mind at the time : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not coming home . All the roads were covered with water and he was able to navigate only by keeping between the telephone poles on either side of him . There was no way he could tell the MAGAZINE depth of the water he was driving through , but he naturally assumed it was only a few inches deep . Nothing in his experience , or in the history of the countryside , made any other assumption logical . He continued to travel on this premise until his motor stopped because his tail pipe was submerged . The first thing he noticed was the noise of the engine stopping . The car coasted a way as the realization of what was happening became clear to him . He looked out and saw the water was up to the door handle . When he opened the door , water rushed into the car . When he stepped out , the water was up to his waist , but he did not realize it at first . He merely thought how strange the headlights looked shining under water , and then , afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car to turn off the lights . He decided to leave the car Where it was with the trunk locked and go for help . But as lie found himself walking through a rapidly rising , rapidly moving stream , he grew frightened . He remembered having read of people being swept away in the flood which had hit northern Connecticut two months earlier as a result of Hurricane Diane . He grabbed a white picket fence .. on one side and began to walk along it , even though this led him toward , not away from , the brook . Hans was dressed for a day in town : black shoes , a gray worsted suit , white shirt , black knit tie , and no hat . The rain coursed over his eyeglasses obscuring the already low visibility . As he crawled along the fence he thought of three things . He had worked desperately for three weeks on the documents now locked in his car , so his first thought was , " Oh , God , now I 've lost the documents . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought was , " I 'm a goner . I will never make it . " The third thing that occurred to him was that the documents were secret and might be swept into the wrong hands . The project on which Hans had been working was a technical sales proposal which his company was making to both the Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission . The closing date for proposals on this development project was October 17 , and the material had to be in Washington , D. C. , at the Atomic Energy Commission , and in Dayton , Ohio , at the Wright Air Development Center , on that date . The project , and therefore all reports , drawings , proposals , etc. pertaining to it , were classified top secret by the Department of Defense and " Q " by the Atomic Energy Commission . The Department of Defense had at that time four levels of classification to indicate the degree of damage that would result to the United States should the information fall into unfriendly hands : in order of importance , Top Secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is the highest information classification used by the AEC . The Secret and " Q " classifications impose certain requirements on documents so classified . They can not be shown except to persons who have , in military security parlance , " the need to know . " They must be locked in a safe with a three-tumbler combination lock whose serial number has been filed off when they are not in possession of somebody with the appropriate clearance . Further , the lock combination must be altered once a year . When the documents are delivered by hand they must be carried by an appropriately cleared messenger called a " courier . " THE CHABMAN W HEN he had walked crablike along the fence about 200 yards , Hans came to a walk leading to a frame house . The water was up to the top porch step and the lights were on in the house . Hans went to the front door and rang . A tall , handsome gray-haired man in his fifties opened the door . Hans said , " My name is Fiedler . May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight foreign accent which Hans , because of the excitement of the moment and his own deep accent , did not detect : " Yes , by all means . Come in . I 'm Mr. Carpovich . " Hans was dripping wet and white as a sheet when he came into the lighted living-room . Mr. Carpovich took a good look at him and asked , " Did something happen ? " " No , " replied Hans , " my car is submerged outside and I have secret documents in it and I must call my wife and the authorities . " Hans called his wife first for he was beginning to worry about her . She was rather incredulous when he told her of his plight for she had no idea anything worse than a rainstorm was occurring . However , she assured him that everything at Hawthorne Place , with the exception of his supper which was overdone , was all right . He said he would be home late . It was then nine o'clock . Hans next called the Stamford police department and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the secret documents by saying , " Why are you bothering us with these details ? We 're too busy saving lives to bother with you and your documents . " Hans then called the local office of the FBI . They were concerned enough to ask him whether the documents were appropriately wrapped according to security regulations ( double-wrapped , inner wrapper containing an indication of security clearance and outer wrapper being plain ) and whether his trunk was locked . When Hans answered yes to both questions , the FBI man on the other end of the phone was in a position to make an administrative decision . " There has not yet been a security violation , " he pontificated . " If there is , be sure and call us . " Lastly Hans called his boss , who was horrified to find that one of his most valuable engineers was in such a dangerous position and who ordered Hans to forget about the secret papers and get the hell out of there . But Hans insisted he would make every attempt to rescue the documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one side of these conversations with a bemused air said to Hans when he finally hung up , " At first I thought that you were joking , but if you are serious I will help you . " " Of course I am serious , " replied Hans with understandable emphasis . " The fate of the nation depends upon my saving those documents . " " In that case I will pick you up on the front porch after I get my boat out of the garage , " said Mr. Carpovich . " Meanwhile , leave your jacket , watch , and valuables upstairs . " It was not until late the next day that Hans discovered that Mr. Carpovich was a Russian electrical engineer . Hans Fiedler too is an electrical engineer who received his undergraduate degree from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1948 and has currently completed almost all his courses for his Ph . D. Both American Atomic Products and Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute look upon Hans as a bright young man . Although he left Austria after the Anschfuss in 1937 when he was fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the United States , he has managed to keep , and possibly even develop , his thick German accent . He is very proud of his Austrian background and vehemently supports the restoration of the Hapsburg monarchy . RESCUE BY ROWBOAT I N ABOUT five minutes Mr. Carpovich came rowing up to the front porch in a small rowboat . Hans got in and took an oar , but he is an ineffectual sailor at best and the excitement of the situation was beginning to tell on him . Mr. Carpovich said , " Just sit still in the middle of the boat and , please , let me row . " Hans meekly sat as directed . It took them about twenty minutes to row up the road to where Hans had left the car . The water had risen so that all of the trunk and hood was submerged . The trunk would have to be unlocked and unloaded under water . Hans and Mr. Carpovich tried to accomplish this maneuver from the boat , but the trunk lock was too far below the gunwale of the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Carpovich took a dint view of this as he was afraid it would capsize the boat , but he had no alternative solution . Hans stepped into the raging stream . He had some difficulty keeping his footing , especially when he was groping under water to unlock the trunk and when he was loading the packages from the trunk to the boat . The water was up to his shoulders . After the cargo transferring operation was completed , there was no room in the boat for Hans . Besides , Mr. Carpovich was afraid he would tip it over trying to get in . He suggested that Hans walk along beside , holding onto the gunwale , while he rowed back to his house . Hans did n't mind walking , as he was as wet as he could get , and he certainly did n't want the boat to capsize and lose his precious documents . But he did n't think it was a good idea to row back to Mr. Carpovich 's house since the water had been up to the porch when they had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walk in the other direction toward higher ground , and that Mr. Carpovich evacuate his family . Mr , Carpovich said that he would be happy to drop Hans and his documents at the home of the Fremonts , ' one of his neighbors on higher ground , but lie saw no need toevacuate his family . They had been living in the same house for eight years and nothing had ever happened to them . He dropped Hans off at the Fremonts ' house where Hans was pleased to see there were still two porch steps not yet under water . He piled his documents on the porch and thanked Mr. Carpovich . Mr. Carpovich said he would be back ; the water was rising higher than he had thought it would and he felt he ought to row over to Mrs. Broom 's house and bring her to the Fremonts ' too . Mrs. Broom was another neighbor of Mr. Carpovich 's , a widow who lived alone . He proceeded to fetch her , deliver her to the Fremonts ' , and then row home . Hans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Hans banged on the door , the Fremonts welcomed him in . He staggered through the front door which opened directly into the livingroom , carrying one of the packages of secret documents which he placed on the floor . Mrs. Fremont , horrified by the stain of muddy water spreading over her beige living-room rug , told Hans that while he was welcome , would lie please leave his packages on the porch . Hans replied , " I ca n't . They might get swept away and the fate of the nation depends upon them . Besides , " he added , quite taken with the idea by now , " there will be more water than this in your living-room before the night is over . " He brought the remainder of the books , which were wrapped in four packages , into the house and piled them in the middle of the carpet . The Fremonts were three : father , Barry ; mother , Charlotte ; and nineteen-year-old daughter , Caprice . They had already begun to be upset by the rising water on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick German accent and the pile of soaking packages in the middle of their living-room did nothing to add to their composure . When Mr. CarpOvich deposited the widow Broom , they became even more alarmed , for she announced that the first floor of her house was under water when she left . They told Hans that they had a steak in the freezer , but he said all he wanted was whisky . They brought him the whisky and suggested that he change his clothes . His clothes were , of course , wet through , but he hesitated to take them off and then have to evacuate the house . But when Caprice Fremont produced a blue onepiece training suit she used for her gyro class in college Hans put it on , He decided he should also make another attempt to interest the authorities in his plight and called the FBI regional office in Hartford . After ascertaining his . location , they made the administrative decision that while there ' night or might not . be a security violation , Hans was not in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the local office . Rather than go through that again , Hans called the AEC 's Hartford office and at last found a sympathetic ear . They agreed that there was clear and immediate danger to the national defense and were all for coming immediately to Hans ' assistance , until they learned where he was . They then decided , wisely , that there was no way for them to get to him and , unwisely , that he should stay at the Fremonts ' with the documents until they could get to him . Hans pointed out that the water was rising fast and he would n't be alive much longer . The only thing to do then , decided the AEC , was to destroy the documents in accordance with regulations . This , they informed Hans , meant that he would have to burn them . Hans allowed a note of scorn to creep into his voice as he replied , " Have you ever tried to burn ninety pounds of soaking wet paper ? " The AEC agreed this was not practical and merely instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to call them in the morning . The group stayed in the Fremonts ' house from ten until 1:30 A.m . During this time Hans not only talked to the FBI and the AEC , but to officials of American Atomic Products and to his wife . The widow Broom was trying to reach her children , and the relatives of the Fremonts were trying to reach them . The phone was constantly busy . So was the phone in Hans ' house . The next day Foo commented , " Hans rang me six times . The duck went in and out of theoven , getting more and , more burned . He never once gave me his telephone number or his address , but kept saying , ' Let me know if there are any developments , ' and then hung up . I could n't call him and could n't tell all the people who kept calling where he was . " EVACUATION EY LAUNCH T HERE was a police car on the high ground above the Fremonts ' issuing instructions via loudspeakers to the neighborhood : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , or if he did not have two stories to make his way to a house which did . The marooned group discussed this and decided there was no point going to the second floor yet , since the water could not possibly rush up the steps as fast as they could . The Fremonts did not think that they would have to evacuate the house . It was located atop a very steep driveway , but Mr. Fremont had to go out about every hour to move his 1951 Cadillac convertible higher up the driveway . The police launch was evacuating people from houses along the lower side of the road and stopped by from time to time to see if all was well . There was , as there usually seems to be , a woman giving birth to a baby in one of the neighboring houses . The police cited this as one reason why they could not bother with the documents . There were also the usual number of invalids to be evacuated and one man with a broken leg . Finally , as the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door , a policeman from a launch appeared and proclaimed , " Everybody out , this house is being evacuated . " Hans was on the phone at the time , talking with the AEC man at Hartford , and he told him what was happening . The AEC man gave him a telephone number and said , " Be sure to call me when you get to dry ground . 11 will try to get to you . " In the excitement of evacuating Hans forgot the telephone number . The policeman on the launch docked at the front porch and was confronted by a wet , angrylooking man trying to load some packages in the boat . " Hey , " he said , " I 'm not interested in the laundry . I came here to save you . " Hans , aided by the Fremonts , who by now were beginning to take a proprietary interest in Hans ' sodden packages , carefully explained that saving the reports was as ? or more ? important than saving people ? at least these particular people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the widow Broom were loaded into the boat and it ? swung away from the brook . The water in the streets was about eight feet deep . The car was completely submerged . Hans , face-to-face with some authorities again , tried to interest them in the importance and plight of his secret documents . But again they insisted they were too busy saving lives as they navigated among the streets , houses , garages , and fences of Stamford . When they got to a part of town where the water was shallow they stopped the launch and informed their passengers that they had reached the end of the line . The end of the line was the middle of the golf course . There was no shelter and the only light came from . the launch itself . It was raining very hard . " You ca n't leave us off here , " said Hans . " We ca n't go any Further without running aground , " replied the police- . " But the least you can do is find some shelter for us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Fremonts . " " We 're sorry , " the police explained , " but we 've got to go hack and save more lives . " The saved but miserable passengers disembarked in two feet of water , and Hans organized a safari , giving a package of papers to- everybody but the widow , and pointing them in the direction of the street lights , away from the deep water . After about five minutes of sloshing through water and mud , they found themselves on dry land , albeit wet pavement . They came to a street light , set down their packages , and waited . They were wet , cold , exhausted , and worried . They were no longer in imminent danger of being drowned , but this had seemed remote even with the water at their front door . People did n't drown in Connecticut , not thispart of Connecticut anyway . They were worried , however , about their homes , friends , relatives , possessions , and where they were going to sleep that night . As they huddled together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came driving toward the golf course . Hans stepped into the road and waved it down . The car stopped , and Hans went up to it . " Where do you think you 're going ? " " Home , " said the driver , a young man in his late twenties . " I live on the other side of town . " " Oh no you 're not , " said Hans . " You 've got to help me to get these people to some shelter , and besides , you 'll never get through here . " " I 'd be glad to help , but I 've got to get to my wife . " " You 'll never get through , " Hans insisted . " The streets are flooded and the bridges are down . Besides , I 've got secret papers in these bundles on which the fate of the nation depends . You 've got to take us . " " All right , " said the driver at last , " but first I 've got to call my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trunk for Hans ' packages , and then ran up the street in search of a telephone . Hans and Barry Fremont loaded the packages in the . trunk , slammed it shut , and then joined the women in the car . ONE MORE RIVER TO CROSS A s THEY settled hack to wait for the driver , another car drove up ? a four-door police sedan driven by a stocky red-faced man in plain , clothes . He yelled across to them , " Is anybody here called Fiedler ? " " That 's me , " said Hans . " Well , where are your damned papers ? You 've got the whole police force upset about them and I 've been detailed to get you and your damn papers home . " " You 've got to take the Fremonts and the widow too . Their homes are under water and they have no place to stay . They will stay at my house . " " Okay , okay , " said the detective , " hut get your papers and let 's go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hans , " but I do n't have the key . The man with the key went off in the rain . " " Oh , God , " muttered the detective . He switched on his transmitter and explained to headquarters what the delay was . They made it quite clear that , no matter what , he was to get Hans and his papers home , or at least out of their precinct . The FBI , AEC , and American Atomic Products had all been calling , and the sergeant would be unhappy if Hans and his papers were drowned or lost . The driver of the Plymouth did not return for an hour . When he did , he apologized and explained that after lie found a telephone , he had difficulty getting through because of all the traffic on the lines . He unlocked the trunk for them and the papers and passengers were transferred to the detective 's car . Their technique for crossing the brook-turnedriver was to get reports on the police radio as to which crossings were still open , drive to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided the water was too swiftrunning , too deep , or both . The third time they managed to cross . in downtown Stamford they had to cross nne of the town 's lowest streets which went under a railroad overpass and acted as a sort of culvert . The detective stopped the car at the crossing and announced that it looked too dangerous to attempt . As they sat there , two boys in their early teens rushed up to ask the detective to help rescue their parents who were trapped in a house surrounded by rising flood water . " I ca n't spend any time saving lives , " said the detective , " I 've got to get these secret papers delivered . " The boys started off into the rain but the detective called , " Wait , you can help us . We have to cross that street and I 'm not sure we can make it without the car stalling or being swept away . You hold on to each other and walk across ahead of the car so that I can see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's getting deeper . " The boys obeyed and guided the car across the street without incident . After dropping the Fremonts off at a relative 's house , the detective left Hans , the widow , and the papers at Hans ' home and hurriedly departed . Foo had expected Hans to be tired and wet but she was unprepared for the sight of him in a dripping , light-blue girl 's gym suit , followed by an elderly woman laughing hysterically and repeating over and over again , " Everything 's lost , everything 's lost . " Taken aback , all Foo could say was , ' Mind the mud . " " Take care of the flood victim , " ordered Hans and swept by into the kitchen where he lit the oven and began drying his documents . As soon as she had satisfied herself as to her husband 's safety , Foo tried to minister first aid to the wet , overwrought pair . This was more difficult than it seemed , for Hans was concerned only with the salvaging of his secret documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally succeeded in getting the widow out of her wet clothes , but although it was 2:30 A.M. , she got neither of them to eat anything . Hans stayed in the kitchen drying his manuscripts . After Foo had given the widow a sedative and put her to bed in the living room , she worked with Hans for the next two hours ? disassembling the books , ironing the clamp , curling pages , and reassembling them . They went to bed at 4:00 A.M. in separate bedrooms . Hans insisted that because of the secret nature of the material , Foo could not be in the same room with the documents while he was asleep . As a matter of fact , when she was in the kitchen with him ironing the pages , he had made certain that each page was face down on the ironing board when she passed the iron over it . The next morning at ten two American Atomic Products couriers arrived to pick up the documents for delivery to Washington and Wright field . The papers were in order and doublewrapped according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his drive him back to where he had left his car . He found it about fifty yards farther on , standing on its front bumper against a telephone pole and buried in silt so that only the trunk and rear bumper protruded . It was a total loss . The Carpovich family was standing in the middle of their wrecked living room , knee-deep in mud . The water had almost completely engulfed the ground floor destroying their furniture , clothing , and books . Hans ' jacket , watch , , and fountain pen which they had placed in the attic were undamaged .
