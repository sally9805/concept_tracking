When he is asked what artist has influenced him most , Painter Lyonel Feininger answers : " Bach . " Visitors to his retrospective show in Manhattan last week could see what he means . Disciplined as fugues , Feininger 's paintings of ships and steeples , trees and towers are masterpieces of order- " organized and orchestrated in color , " Feininger hopes , " like a large-scale composition for the organ . " Over the years , his compositions have won Lyonel Feininger recognition as one of the most distinguished of living U.S. artists , and last week , at 80 , he was still composing as strongly as ever . <P> Permanent Drift . Born in Manhattan , Feininger started out to be a musician . His father was a violinist , his mother a pianist and Lyonel eventually became both . He was a shy and lonely boy who practiced four or five hours a day , then listened for hours more to his parents ' performances . When he was 16 , his father decided that he should continue his studies in Leipzig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was away . While waiting in Hamburg for his return , Lyonel drifted into studying art . <P> The drift soon became permanent . Lyonel became a caricaturist , and though still living in Europe , he began drawing comic strips for the Chicago Tribune . He soon learned to hate deadlines , found that what he really wanted was to paint ( " My contentment is founded on creative work " ) . He joined the Bauhaus group , and with Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky ( TIME , March 24 ) became a top apostle of abstract art . " I have to destroy nature , " he cried , " before I can build her up again . " The architect he took as his model : Johann Sebastian Bach . <P> New Design . To Feininger , each object he chose to paint-a ship gliding through the fog , a cathedral town or a Manhattan skyscraper-was nothing more than a theme . It was the space around it that gave it life and provided the harmony . <P> As if holding a prism to his eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments with color and re-order them into a design . " A boat moving in the atmosphere , " says he , " sets up stresses and movements in the air . That is what I visualize , and the pattern and organization of those stresses . " <P> Today , erect as a Junker , Lyonel Feininger is still absorbed by the stresses of the ghostly world he creates , where shadow and substance play upon each other in a sort of counterpoint . Each day , after helping his wife tidy up their Manhattan apartment , he disappears into his studio . Sometimes he comes out to strum a bit on the piano , then returns to paint again and grumble about the light . <P> Though he paints and grumbles less explosively now , his object is the same . " The whole world , " says he , " is nothing but order . "
