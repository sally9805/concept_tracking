txt WASHINGTON , Feb. ** Democrats from all over who gathered here this week-end to hear former President Truman heap fire and brimstone on the Eisenhower Administration , and to exchange reports on the general party prospect , are perhaps the most optimistic group of politicians since the delegates assembled at Philadelphia to renominate President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner in 1936 . This was plain to any observer seasoned in the business of distinguishing the real enthusiasm of politicians From the sham , after mingling in the hotel lobbies with the rank and file and talking privately with the leaders in their rooms . This optimism , fortified by a hair-line Republican victory this week in a rural Minnesota Congressional district that since 1893 has constantly elected Republicans by large margins , was so unanimous and so confident that it produced in the former President , the admired center of all attention , the only show of Concern in what for him was a triumphant occasion . He has not forgotten 1948 , when the Republicans , most Democrats and nearly all political analysts save himself were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellowDemocrats to bear in mind that , next to the resources of the other party , overconfidence is the greatest threat to success politics . Useful Advice But this prudent counsel was the only note of restraint to be heard in the celebration of a Democratic prospect for the ' 1958 and 1960 elections that ' seemed to grow brighter with ' each report exchanged . The , agreement being general that in the November election at least ' ball a dozen new Democratic eats would be gained in the Senate and a minimum of fifty in the House . the principal topic was who the chief contestants for the Presidential nomination in 1960 would be , and which seemed likeliest to obtain it . And on this there not only was lisagreement , but clear evidence : hat none of the Democrats dis , ussed has a commanding lead tt this time in the calculation , f the professionals . There are several substantial ? reasons for this . One is that , as lie expectation of certain vico : ? grows , the value of the ' residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an intense conflict at he national convention . A secaid is that a plain political liaJility more or less burdens every . spirant who conceivably might le nominated . A third reason s that , until the next Congress las been chosen , until the party rositions are made on the issues hat will interest the voters of 960 , and until the Democratic aders who are not candidates ake their choices , no contender an be measured for his strength the convention . ? . o n't Repeat Error Among those leaders who ill importantly influence the ecision of the 1960 convention t was obvious from his recep , pn here that the former Presitent will be in the forefront . He old friends that not again will wait until the eleventh hour lo notify the party of his choice . is he did in 1956 on the eve of convention . It was only hen Truman urged the nomiation of Governor Harriman. nd he still holds to the , elief that if he had made this love a few months earlier his pcommendation would have preailed . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , not too long after the 1958 ongressional election , " name is preference for the consideraion of the convention . That is not likely to foreclose he nomination . There are State ' ) emocratic organizations which oppose a candidate sponored by Truman , and for that ? eason . There are others which , Hough friendly and admiring , want the party to ride the wave of the future unmixed with any surges of the past . On this principle they would exclude the former President and the record of his Administration as a campaign issue with the Republicans . Important Influence But the influence Truman plans to put to the test in the pre - convention period will be important . And it is difficult to envisage any Democrat now obviously seeking the Presidency , or suspected of doing so eventually , who would try to forestall or shrug off the Truman accolade . The discussions during the week-end reflected the fact that , as distinct from the Republicans , the Democrats have a long list of citizens whom political analysts rate as capable of victory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are scraps of paper ; nevertheless , the name of Vice President Nixon is the only one yet firmly written on the Republican page . But the Democrats here were weighing , as men who conceivably could be elected President if nominated , all of the following : ( In alphabetical order ) Senator Gore of Tennessee , Governor Harriman , Senator Johnson of Texas , Senator Kefauver of Tennessee , Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts , Governor Meyner of New Jersey . Stevenson of Illinois , Senator Symington of Missouri and Governor Williams of Michigan . Each of these was also commended by some as a Vice Presidential nominee who could lend great strength to the ticket if he failed of first place . And there was a register of the same opinion for Governor Muskie of Maine , and for Attorney General Brown of California should he be elected Governor this year over William F. Knowland . The atmosphere was of a party whose cup is brimming over . One Strike on Each But this very fact promotes conflict , particularly for a prize already rated as half won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described by one participant , " proved there is at least one strike " against every possible nominee . As cited , these were : Gore and Kefauver are Southerners ; Nixon would have a better chance to defeat a Southerner ; and the candidacy of both would split the Democrats of Tennessee . Johnson is more Western than Southern , but he has had a heart attack and projects the " oil-and-gas " issue . Harriman is " too old . " Kennedy is " too young " ; also his candidacy might revive the denominational emotion of the 1928 campaign . Meyner 's qualifications are impressive , but he might pose the denominational issue " in reverse . " Williams has been too responsive to the special interests of organized labor . Symington embodies a military defense issue that might disappear by 1960 . Stevenson is a two-time loser and is prone to indecisiveness that could cost the party yet another election . But all were in the running this week - end ? conversationally , that is.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
