COMMEND to your notice a recent book by John Steinbeck , The Moon is Down , " Winston Churchill , most literate of war leaders , most effective of book reporters , wrote his Minister of Economic Warfare in the blazing havoc of 1942 's springtime , " published this year by the Viking Press of New York . In addition to being a well-written story , " the distinguished critic went on to say , putting first things first , as usual , " it stresses , I think quite rightly , the importance of providing the conquered nations with simple weapons , such as sticks of dynamite , which could easily be concealed and are easy in operation . " The next time anyone ? highbrow , lowbrow , or snob unassigned ? tells you he just has no time to read at all , ask him courteously , sympathetically , how on earth he can stand leading a busier life than Winston Churchill . You will find Churchill speaking of The Moon Is Down in the cathedral reaches of The Hinge of Fate ( Houghton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most personal and most majestic war story , better than any new historical romance , bland , wily , assured , and magnificent . In office again today , I have no doubt you 'd hear him firing salvos of the same sort at his attendant ministers and field marshals , on land , overseas , and in the air , though hell rocked the planet . " Pray read Caught , by a Manchester manufacturer who calls himself Henry Green , " ( Viking , $3 ) he might shoot at the fellow charged with the defense of his beloved Lon-don . " It is a rather mannered novel that sometimes seems to tell too much about too few . But I am bound to say that I agree , in principle , with its somewhat elliptically expressed criticisms of this Island 's Auxiliary Fire Service . Are we going to get our fair share of axes available from America this year ? " Or , let us imagine a secret document headed , " Prime Minister to Minister of Production , Secretary of State for War , Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chief of Combined Operations , and Chief of H. M. Stationery Office : " I have just read the Advance Proofs ( uncorrected ) of The Hell Bomb Knopf , $2.75 by William L. Laurence , a scientific colleague ( in my capacity as contributor to the New York Times ) . In it Mr. Laurence says : ' While we may not announce it to the world , we have good reason to expect that the first H-bomb will be ready for testing sometime in 1951 , possibly in early summer . ' As I have said before , although personally I am quite content with the existing explosives , I feel we must not stand in the path of improvement . But we must not run the mortal risk of being outstripped in this awful sphere . I have written in The Hinge of Fate that if the Americans had not been willing to attempt the atomic bomb venture ( on which the H-bomb now grows ) , we should certainly have gone forward on our own power in Canada , or , if the Canadian Government demurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not afford to let the whole of this vital factor in our defense fall into twilight . Pray let me have full reports on our present position . " I have ventured to improvise thus from Mr. Churchill 's published statements in The Hinge of Fate in order to emphasize his own capacity for showing us what we all know , and all so frequently overlook , that words are no good whatever unless they find use beyond the printed page . Words are action , or potential action , waiting to be released through an alchemy older than the Sangre de Cristo mountain range that literature 's latest Laurence describes , blood-red in the dying light where new light was born , at Los Alamos . Others , during World War II , talked and talked and talked about words being weapons , books being bullets . But was it not Churchill who always used them best ? Had n't we all better find more time for more read-ing ? I N The Hinge of Fate Mr. Churchill also uses his knowledge of books for a variety of pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving from Washington to President Roosevelt 's celebratedly secret hideout , Shangri-La , he astonished the Roosevelts and Harry Hopkins by reciting " Barbara Frietchie " as the car passed the Frederick , Maryland , window that inspired our own Bab Ballad . ( " And why not , " the author in our house says , " was n't his mother an American ? " ) His audience was obviously unable to correct his misquotations . He then told them what he 'd read and thought about Lee and Stonewall Jackson . And : " After a while silence and slumber descended upon the company , as we climbed with many a twist and turn up the spurs of the Alleghenies . " One of the questions discussed that weekend was a proposed meeting between Churchill and another visitor to America , Madame Chiang Kai-shek . The generaiissima was in New York , and intimated that she would be glad to receive hfin there . He could n't make it . The President suggested lunch at the White House . But : " The invitation was refused with some hauteur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Grand Alliance , Mr. Churchill offered to go halfway if she would do the same . That plan was considered facetious , however , so Mr. Churchill and Mme. Chiang did not meet until the Cairo Conference . MAGAZINE Mr. Churchill read Moll Flanders ( " about which I had heard excellent accounts , " and possibly better than Miss Winsor 's Regency moll ) while fighting pneumonia , a minor adversary . He thought well enough of Defoe 's novel to pass it on to his doctor , " to cheer him up . The treatment was successful . " He quoted Kipling , untroubled by that great writer 's fluctuating literary fame . When Tobruk fell and things got rough in Parliament he triumphantly capped a quotation from Macaulay . Who but Churchill would cite another great ironist to praise Montgomery when the Allied hinge of fate swung at long last at Alamein , where ten thousand men fell in twelve days as compared to sixty thousand men on the first day of the first world war 's Somme ? Monty certainly did like to wait around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , says Churchill , " he believed , as Bernard Shaw said of Napoleon , that ' cannons kill men . ' " There are many accounts of battles in private with Stalin here , before and after Stalingrad . The Soviets , in those days , had not unfurled their best-known contribution to the United Nations : voting , " No , no , no . " On the contrary , whether it was for guns or planes or tanks , or convoys to carry their eleven billion dollars ' worth of Lend-Lease , their eternal cry was , " More ! More ! More ! " Here is the by now famous account of Churchill being asked around to Joe 's place after a final , formal , stormy meeting in the Kremlin : " Stalin seemed suddenly embarrassed , and said in a more cordial tone than he had yet used with me , ' You are leaving at daybreak . Why should we not go to my house and have some drinks ? ' I said that I was in principle always in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's small apartment , set by a housekeeper and Stalin 's red-haired daughter , they ate and drank and talked till two-thirty in the morning . They were served the usual quantities of food and wine that always make accounts of Soviet festivities sound like wedding dinners at the marriage of a liquor dealer 's son and a delicatessen keeper 's daughter . At first Stalin pecked through the courses , but when " a considerable sucking-pig was brought to the table " at half-past one , A.M. , his usual dinner hour , he asked Sir Alexander Cadogan , who had arrived with a communiqu ? , " to join him in the conflict . " Cadogan said no thanks , whereupon , Churchill writes , " our host fell upon the victim single-handed . " A little earlier , Churchill had asked Stalin whether the war had been as rough on him as collectivizing the farms . " Oh no , " said Stalin , " the Collective Farm policy was a terrible struggle . " " I thought you would have found it bad , " Churchill observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score thousands of aristocrats or big landowners , but with millions of small men . " " Ten millions , " said Stalin , holding up his hands . As he thought of millions of men and women being blotted out or displaced forever , Churchill remembered , but did not say aloud , Burke 's dictum : " If I can not have reform without injustice , I will not have reform . " O NE of the books Mr. Churchill read before writing this one was Robert E. Sherwood 's Roosevelt and Hopkins , and he corrects here , with wonderful adroitness , a salient statement on the salient issue of the unconditional surrender policy he had contributed to Mr. Sherwood 's volume . " I heard the words ' Unconditional Surrender ' for the first time from the President 's lips at the Casablanca Conference , " Mr. Churchill wrote Mr. Sherwood some time before Roosevelt and Hopkins appeared in 1948 . But that was by no means the end of that . When he brought out his 1950 edition , early last year , Sherwood noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's unconditional surrender formula as being in the papers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on preparations for Casablanca . Furthermore , Anthony Eden told Mr. Sherwood in July 1949 , that cables found in the Cabinet 's files called for corrections . These cables were aired in November 1949 , when Mr. Churchill agreed he had been wrong , showed that President Roosevelt had also been a bit hazy or hasty in his recollections , and proceeded to pour some scalding oil on his former colleague and present antagonist , Foreign Minister Bevin . BOOKS Why Bevin ? Well , Bevin , a wartime member of Churchill 's coalition cabinet , was now claiming that Churchill had n't consulted them at the time of Casablanca , on that ; and now , as Attlee 's Foreign Minister , he was having a terrible time in dealing with Germany , partly as a result of the unconditional surrender policy . That 's all Churchill needed to hear . He saw his opening . And he struck hard . He produced a cable he had sent Attlee , Bevin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1942 , five days before the end of the Casablanca Conference . The cable said he and FDR were proposing to draw up a statement at Casablanca , including " a declaration of the firm intention of the United States and the British Empire to continue the war relentlessly until we have brought about the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan . " What would the cabinet think of that ? To which Attlee Co. replied : " The Cabinet were unanimously of opinion that the balance of advantage lay against excluding Italy " ! Did n't that show they were in favor of the unconditional surrender formula itself , and only wanted Italy included ? Did n't it show that Bevin had been consulted , had known about the unconditional surrender policy , and had agreed to it ? " I think , " Mr. Churchill said , silkily , " Mr. Bevin was mistaken in saying he was not a party to that opinion before President Roosevelt 's speech was given to the Press . " Indeed , Mr. Churchill spoke so well that it was almost possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken , too . For while making a handsome correction of his error Mr. Churchill brought delighted laughter from the House by saying there was always a great danger in quoting from memory when these things cropped up about the tumultuous past . They all remembered the advice which the aged tutor gave to his disciples and followers on his deathbed when they came to him ? " Verify your quotation . " That fracas is reported in Sher-wood 's 1950 notes , from an account of the debate in the London Times . Now , in The Hinge of Fate , Mr. Churchill goes over it smoothly , even heightening the luster of the clinching anecdote by advancing suitably the " aged tutor " to a professorship , in this version , and widening the application of the newly-promoted aged sage 's advice with one sibilant consonant : " Verify your quotations . " Always magnanimous in victory , Mr. Churchill gives a hearing to every opinion on the DarIan deal when the Allies landed ( remember : we " landed " in North Africa ; we " invaded " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Algiers . Indeed , I think he is more than fair about that whole sorry business , where we were damned if we did or did n't . It seems to me that he is rather forbearing , on the whole . For what , you might ask the next person who tells you that the unexpected assassination of DarIan was much too good for him , do you suppose might . have happened if we had immediately recognized De Gaulle as rightful ruler of France , and started him on a sweeping march to power and glory ? Well , the vitality of Mr. Churchill 's history lies also in its capacity to stir further arguments ? not alone in its weight in settling them . The last word has by no means been said on who was right and who was wrong about all the plans and counterplans for invading the Balkans , for not invading the Balkans , for trying to get into France in 1942 , for not even trying to get into France in 1943 , and so on and on and on . W @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the moon was really down for the Allies . That was in May 1942 . Rommel was running rampant across the top of Africa . In the Atlantic , the free world 's convoys drowned ; the Caribbean was afire with burning tankers . In the Pacific we had not yet seen the sunrise at bloody and symbolic Midway . In Russia , things were going so poorly that fellow-travelers , safely suffering far away , could get thrills of vicarious audacity by howling for a Second Front . Things got better after that , as you see again in these pages , which end in June /943 , with Churchill . where they might keep Eisenhower and Alexander up all night with talking , but the imperial little old Montgomery retired promptly at ten . Out of the Bible itself had come the code name for perhaps the most fantastic of all Mr. Churchill 's dazzling sprays of schemes , the one called Habbakuk . What was " Habbakuk " ? It was a plan to use artificially thickened icebergs ? that 's right , icebergs ? as floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the berg begins to move southward , so that it is clear of ice floes , " Mr. Churchill said , " vessels can come alongside and put all the equipment , including ample flak , on board . " If that sounds preposterous , remember that the artifical harbors built on the French coast in June 1944 once sounded even more so . And so , in that day , no doubt , would the infernally supernal hydrogen bomb that William L. Laurence tells us about in the first important book on what may be the final important weapon , The Hell Bomb . We needed a match to light hydrogen for the Hell bomb . We needed a rather special match , since it had to have a pretty hot flame . It had to have a warmth around 50 million degrees centigrade , and that 's a good bit hotter than the temperature in the interior of the sun . We got a promise of the match when the atomic bomb worked at Los Alamos . The trick now , the trick on which the future of humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light the right kind of hydrogen . Mr. Laurence explains the care and feeding of Hell bombs in a wonderfully lucid way . He goes into staggering financial and scientific problems with patience , tact , and a remarkable gift for dramatizing the unspeakable . Whenever he comes to a thorny patch or an abyss on man 's endless road to universal destruction , you breathe a sort of relieved sigh . You think , well , maybe we 'll all live a little longer , after all . But of course you 've still got to grapple with the Laurentian ranges of figures . ( " To make a bomb of a thousand times the power of the A-bomb would require 1,000 kilograms of deuterium at a cost of $4,500,000 , or 171 kilograms of tritium and 114 kilograms of deuterium at a cost of more than not counting the cost of the A-bomb trigger . " ) And that $166 billion does seem a bit stiff , even at current prices . Then , with large-scale production , Mr. Laurence starts bringing the price down , and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantasy fades , when you read just how coldly possible it seems to be to achieve the astounding destruction that Einstein and others have told us is within the Hell bomb 's range . The Russians may be hot on one too . And Mr. Laurence reminds you that Klaus Fuchs , the traitor , may have passed on all sorts of information he got at Los Alamos . W HAT makes a man a traitor ? A thousand cases may bring a thousand answers ? and a buzzing swarm of words such as " hysteria " and " red-baiting " and " intolerance " ? when anyone ventures to point out that there really is such a thing as treason , and that treason is defined in the Constitution , though that passage is not always quoted by people who can recite the Bill of Rights . In The Traitor ( Farrar , Straus , $3 ) , William Shirer , who wrote Berlin Diary , has produced a novel designed to show what made one Oliver Knight , American newspaperman , betray his country and serve Nazi Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as convincing as the scenes that show Germany in flames . You sometimes feel that Mr. Shirer wanders pretty far from his main point , Knight , in hortatory discussions of what other people did , and when , and how , and why . Yet there is a lot that is worth remembering in his book , and it is clear that Mr. Shirer mainly needs to cultivate the storytelling art that Winston Churchill singled out in Steinbeck . One of our day 's ablest , subtlest , and most entertaining storytellers is Henry Green , whose target-titled novels ? Nothing , Loving , Back , and now Caught ? have been arriving from England again lately , stirring cackling fury in his enemies and cheerful pleasure in his friends . There seems no prospect that his comedies of the mind and tragedies of the heart will displace those wor-thy novelists who do so much to rt own to earth and the late G. A. Henty up to date . But try reading Caught , the story of a brilliantly bewildered public-school Englishman , widowed , witty , forlorn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary London of the war 's first months . You will see what startling lights and colors Green can find in the most probable and in the most improbable material . O w of the outstanding trends of 1951 will be a sharp increase in the America-must ( or **27;587;TOOLONG ? ) books . They will scarcely agree on anything but urgency . They will range from idvocacy of non-violence to proposals for preventive war . They will be useful to have , since they will keep in the happily incurably optimistic American mind the desperate 3eril we have somehow learned to : ake as a matter of course . More ibout these , next month , Deo , olente . Another trend , I predict , will be he wholesale " rediscovery " of " for-rotten " authors . We have , of course , ) een holding trial-trends for this nterrnittently in recent years , startng with revivals of writers who had eally been forgotten ( often for sin ? larly good reasons ) and rising to he well-meant absurdity of trying o believe that hardly anyone re1embered Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are gorg to crash into the revivals , and le result will be worth watching , ric reasons that elude me at the toment . The signs of the coming ) 1fision , however , are already mulplying . When Somerset Maugham grew red , last fall , of seeing his works attered through innumerable new ithologies , for example , he brought it one of his own , The Maugham eader ( Doubleday , $5 ) , with an troduction by Glenway Wescott at felicitously managed to praise id disparage Maugham simuIta ! ously , in a tone of remorseless olatry . But so much half-foritten Maughamiana turned up in e book ? including a couple of plays , " Our Betters " and " The Constant Wife " ? that the book clearly constituted a revival as well as an anthology . John Marquand has perhaps gone him one better by reissuing an early novel separately , with the thought that it 's new if you have n't read it before , which applies with equal force to " Cinderella . " Where will it all end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the anthology and revival rights ahead of original publication . As a confirmed revivalist , and as a man who is even now brooding over the possibility of issuing a book to be called The Good Anthology of the Better Readers of the Best Little Treasuries of the Year , I do not complain . But I hope some paper will be left over for new writers with something fresh to say . I CAN NOT think of any American author who deserves and will repay a revival ? what a word ! ? more than Stephen Crane . True , The Red Badge of Courage , which Ernest Hemingway has rightly called " one of the finest books of our literature " and " The Open Boat " turn up all over the place . And Maggie will keep a covey of bibliographers haggling for hours . And Twenty Stories , selected by Carl Van Doren ( Crane , he memorably said , " is still a living writer not because he was prophetic but because he was excellent . Prophets come and go . It is excellence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1940 , when men were going out once more to try to see war as clearly as Stephen Crane ? who had not seen war when he wrote The Red Badge of Courage . Now John Berryman has written Stephen Crane ( Sloane , $3.75 ) , a combatively devoted biography , for the admirable American Men of Letters Series . It is the most thorough , the most learned , the most painstaking book on Stephen Crane in existence . It owes a great deal to Thomas Beer 's incomparable Stephen Crane : A Study in American Letters and it goes far beyond Beer 's book , without ever managing to achieve anything like Beer 's genius for making you want to read Stephen Crane . The debt to Beer is handsomely acknowleckedyou can count clustering references to Thomas Beer until you grow tired , as I did , of endlessly writing " B " " B " " B " in the margins ? and a sort of posthumous argument with Beer is forever carried on , chapter after chapter . There is also a psychological examination of Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moby Dick on the analyst 's couch in Herman Melville . All these insights or distractions aside , Mr. Berryman has brought to light an amazing amount of information about the young man who died , securely famous after a life of spectacular insecurity in New York , Mexico , Cuba , Greece , and England , in 1900 , having been born in 1871 , just seven years before Carl Sand-burg , four years before Robert Frost , three years before Somerset Maugham , and twelve years after John Dewey . The mythical sins attributed to Stephen Crane cluster inevitably around many writers ; the desperately true privations they endure are listed as sheer improvidence . In Mr. Berryman 's scrupulous pages many a fie is nailed , though he knows that the worst tales about Crane will live , malevolently . But so , half a century later , do Crane 's own best stories . He would have been interested in that ; he was aware of the growing legend about him : he was a connoisseur of irony ; he had written the most haunting of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a button On the bright splendid shroud of your son , Do not weep . War is kind , yet no one has ever understood better than Stephen Crane why men , born to freedom , will go for freedom to places where they touch the great death , and find that , " after all , it was but the great death .

A Saturday afternoon in October with the radio blaring out the Princeton-Cornell game three rooms away is perfect background for the reading of this " hilarious novel about football . " Against such a background the story of the charming little D.P. , ex-professor of engineering at the University of Wittemberg , who comes to America and gets a job at the football-mad Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually coach , seems amusing , touching , and quite in tune with the staccato reporting and hoarse roarings which periodically emerge from the radio down the hall . One is convinced by and absorbed in the adventures of the little man , so unpolitical that when , during the occupation , he was " pushed , pulled , starved , brow-beaten , pummeled , inquired into , lined up , and otherwise inconvenienced , " he finally asked in mild perplexity of the man behind him in line , " They are perhaps hostile to engineering ? " His American . adventures , as he starts applying his engineering skill to football formations , his great good will in understanding American folk and folkways are indeed riotous while the reading lasts . When the game is over and the radio-madness subsides in the room down the hall , the book , too , fades out a little . But a most pleasant couple of hours between kick-off and final whistle .

Everyone knows that the author of the Captain Hornblower series can not be dull and that he has an extraordinary ability for making history live . But I think it will come as a surprise ? it certainly did to me ? that he can make the fate of a young middle-class British soldier during and after World War I a matter of such moment . The soldier was an ordinary , good lad , son of a schoolmaster , who like most of his contemporaries had gone straight from school to the trenches .

This story of a young American returned from war with a mortal injury and the psychological effect of his illness on the girl he marries , his mother and father , and his great-grandfather , is tortured and tortuous in spite of good writing . So little happens in terms of action , so much in terms of recollection and throwhacks ? especially the interminable family history dug up by the great-grandfather for the benefit of the great-grandson .
