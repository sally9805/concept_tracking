Almost all the drivers in Florida 's Grand Prix of Endurance ( TIME , April 2 ) knew just what to expect in their twelve-hour race on the runways of Sebring . They had run the car-killing course before , in the race for points that count in computing the world championship . There was one man , though , who came mostly for the ride . Last year 's Indianapolis-500 winner . Bob Sweikert , wanted to see what this closed-course road racing was all about . <P> Tough as it is , the big spin in the Indianapolis " brickyard " avoids the car-killing problems of Sebring 's abandoned airfield . In the 500-mile grind , all the turns are to the left , and cars often have their engines canted to put more weight on the inside wheels . There are no gearboxes , no tricky downshifting to decelerate for the curves . Sweikert was attracted to Sebring as a place to try new techniques . <P> In his sleek grey Jaguar-D , Sweikert learned fast ; he decided to use an old Indianapolis trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow him to skid through turns without riding the brake pedal . He paid careful attention to hints handed out by World Champion ( and eventual Sebring winner ) Juan Manuel Fangio . And he made a point of not pushing it to mechanical breakdown . As a result , he finished third . <P> More important , when he finished , he was at least a limited convert to Grand Prix road racing . " I liked it at Sebring , " said he . " Those drivers are all gentlemen . If you came up behind a slower car and they saw you-they have rear-view mirrors , which we do n't at Indianapolis-they moved out of the groove , let you go by and gave you a wave . Up here we 're courteous and we 're gentlemen , but moving out of the groove ? ' ' - his face showed dismay- " we do n't do that . " <P> Sweikert has too many commitments to push his road-racing luck any farther this year , but in 1957 , he said , " I will devote the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indianapolis all right . But that 'll be all . " Determined to give his Sebring mentor , Juan Fangio , a fight for the world championship , Indianapolis Gentleman Bob Sweikert evened things up last week by offering Fangio a crack at the 500-mile title , invited him to race at the brickyard this May in one of Sweikert 's two entries . Fangio said he would like that , but he also had some commitments .
