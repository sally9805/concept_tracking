In an H-bomb attack , U.S. cities as far as 190 miles away from the actual explosion could expect a deadly fallout of wind-borne radioactive particles ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) . Last week in Madison , Wis. , the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory described a new building material called " diffusion board , " that can protect against direct contact with radioactive dust . <P> Developed for the Army Chemical Corps , diffusion board resembles ordinary wood-pulp fiberboard , ? in. thick . Impregnated with special chemicals ( the kinds are still classified ) , it acts much like an ordinary Army gas mask , filters out gases and germ-carrying particles as well as radioactive dust , lets oxygen and carbon dioxide breathe through . Against direct radiation itself , the porous diffusion board gives no protection . Thick lead or concrete shields must be used to keep out death-dealing gamma rays . Moreover , lining the walls of an average home with the board would not eliminate dust , which could sift in over windowsills and door-jambs . But used in windowless shelters in fallout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel from inhaling or touching radioactive dust , keep vital defense centers going that otherwise would have to be evacuated .
