" You sound like my tutor . " " Do n't . This is important . " " Oh very well . " She leaned her chin on her hand , frowning . " When Professor Cavan talks about things he cares about , it 's terrific , but it 's "  --  she hesitated again  --  " it 's almost too much , George . I mean it 's as if he were batteringdown a wall inside himself to get through , and so one feels battered too  --  it 's exciting , but disturbing . You 'll hate me for this "  --  she turned to him now quite seriously  --  " but should anyone allow himself to be that exposed  --  a professor ? " " Is that why you said where are we ' ? " " I suppose so . One expects a professor to be a little less or a little more than human  --  I think that 's it . They all have their attitudes , their little jokes , their ways to protect themselves . But Cavan is just there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . " " Except the subject , Pen  --  or rather , " George correctedhimself a little stiffly , " an attitude toward the subject . You felt that surely ? " " I was awfully uncomfortable all the time , " she confessed . This George recognized as the truth , and he minded . The class , when they talked about Cavan over beer or in their rooms , had not one of them ever admitted this , but it was the truth . Yet they would not have missed a single meeting for the world . They were attracted and at the same time disturbed , made uncomfortable , as Pen said . " But it 's not what he says "  --  George turned to her earnestly  --  " isit ? I mean if you wrote down everything he said today , every word made sense  --  at least to me . It was rightp101at the center of things , was n't it ? Was n't that what you felt ? " " Absolutely .

" But this of course was not an answer , and he knew it . " He comes closer to what teaching should be than anyone  --  " he added as if a further blank check was needed . " What should teaching be ? " He laughed . " I was going to say a transfusion , but it sounds absurd  --  something more anyway than an intellectualexercise  --  Oh , you know , " he ended , reaching across for her hand . It was ice cold , as it always was these days . He looked at it for a moment , lying there quite passively in his as if it did n't belong to her . " Next year I might get an instructorship . We could get married . " He had not meant to say it like this , so casually , but it just popped out as if he had in the last hour reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She withdrew her hand quite violently and sat looking down at her lap , her face closed up like an empty house . " Do n't push me , George , please . " " I 'm not pushing you , " he said irritably . " But after all , we 've known each other for a year " " I 'm sorry , George . " " Is there someone else ? " he could just bring himself to ask . She hesitated , then answered looking at him veryp102frankly , " Only myself . I do n't know really who I am , you see . I do n't know what it 's all about . It 's not my fault . " " Oh , I know , " he groaned , " I do all the wrong things . " " It was n't the wrong thing to take me to the seminar , darling . " So near to misery he had been a second before , so near now he was to happiness because she had said " darling . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky day.  |p103Ivan  Goldberg sat at the big desk in his ground-floor office at Warren House sharpening a bunch of pencils very methodicallyand neatly with a small penknife . Boys banging in for conferences could cast an eye on him , a somehow formidablepresence sitting there rather like a Chinese god to whom one might make an obeisance , but with whom one would not carry on a casual conversation . He sat very erect , the shadow of a smile on his lips , immaculately dressed ( was it true that he changed his shirt three times a day ? ) and looking rather more like a banker than a professor , his keen black eyes always alert , magnified by thick glasses . This was a face that never relaxed , was never to be caught off guard . If Cavan seemed to Pen too exposed , Goldberg had contrived a facade which no one had ever seen through completely . With students he maintained the upper hand on principle . He had made it his business to have all thep104answers within his field of English and American literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated , with a mind like a fencer 's , he was bound to win . He was feared because he had deliberately chosen to be feared ; he believed in an absolute hierarchy . His god was the University but he considered himself a high priest to be treated accordingly . He expected a student due for a conferenceto be there on the dot . As Chapel rang the hour , he adjusted his watch . Perkins was late again . But it was not after all Perkins who swung open the heavy door into the hall ; it was Edward Cavan . " Have you got a few minutes , Ivan ? " " Of course . Shut the door . Perkins is one minute late and it will do him good to cool his heels . " Goldberg came out from behind his desk and sat down in one of two armchairsto the right of it . It was a subtly flattering gesture , as if he would consciously give up the advantage of sitting behind a desk . And it was a gesture symptomatic of his relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had the greatest respect and at the same time the man who was among them all his real antagonist . For Goldberg did not approve of Edward Cavan 's emphasis on what he called the periphery of literature  --  economics , history , all that could be rolled up in the term " cultural historian . " He did not follow this modern fashion ; he considered himself a purist . Cavan 's political activities not only made him uncomfortable , but actually made him suffer . He suffered that a professor of such distinction should make a fool of himself . He felt that it reflected on the University , but even worse , it diminished Cavan 's authority , and Cavan 's authority was necessary to him . He had chosen his enemy as other men choose their friends and he wanted his enemy to be immac/ulate , beyond reproach . " What 's on your mind , Edward ? " he asked , taking a cigarette from a silver case and offering Edward one . But he regretted the easy question as soon as he had asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that too much was on Edward 's mind for anyone to speak of it casually . Edward was sitting forward in his chair , ill at ease , and more than usually crumpled-looking . He might at least keep his pants pressed , Ivan thought . " You 're not going to like this , Ivan "  --  Edward looked up a moment , his chin forward a little , his eyes unsmiling . " Well , what is it ? " Goldberg sat back deliberately in his chair , the cigarette hanging from his lips so that the smoke curled about his head and he looked more than ever impassive and judicial , the man who had his guard up in the presence of the man who had no guard . " You know about the case out in Nebraska , I presume ? " " I seem to have read something about it in the Grim-son  --  - " A Professor Lode in the department of economics there has been fired on the grounds that he campaigned for Wallace . Of course this is not what the official pronouncementis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the college and they 've knuckled under . " Edward 's tone was , as always in such matters , harsh and belligerent . Goldbergobserved this and it hurt him . The man had no business to be so passionate . " Yes , yes  --  I do remember the facts , " he said warily . " I want you to head a Harvard committee to protest . " Having launched his bomb , Edward now sat back to wait for it to explode . It had evidently been an effort , for Goldbergsaw the faint sweat on his forehead.  | " I should have thought this was up your alley rather than mine , " Goldberg played for time . " At this point my name would be damaging . I campaignedfor Wallace myself , if you remember . " " My dear fellow , you know very well that I will do no such thing . " Edward got up with a gesture of some violence , stood there , as if he was going to walk out , then said very quietly , " What if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't do things that way at Harvard , as you know very well . I presume this is a state university and politics naturally enter in . No , Edward , I have steadfastly refused to be involved in political matters and I do n't see why I should suddenly go back on my position now . " " But this is not a matter of politics , Ivan . " Edward was obviously forcing himself to be patient . " You ca n't evade it on those grounds . It 's a matter of freedom to think and believe and say what you believe . It 's a basic American principle which is being attacked here . It 's the opening wedge in a fight against the intellectuals as subversives not only for political reasons but because they 're intellectuals . You 're just being an ostrich , " Edward said , sitting down again abruptly , determined , it appeared , to stay and fight this out once and for all . " The reason the intellectuals are being lumped together as subversives is that too many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their last , we would n't be in this mess . " Goldberg deliberately became gentler and sweeter in tone and more smiling as what he said became fiercer in content . " Very well , " Edward shouted hoarsely , his face quite red now and all pretence of reasonableness gone , " have itp107your own way . Say we were all crazy and wrong , you still ca n't condone firing a man without a hearing . You simply ca n't . For once in your life , Ivan , you are not going to escape into your ivory tower . You just ca n't do it , cold fish though you may be . " Goldberg felt the smile on his own face freeze so that he seemed to be looking out of a mask . Inside it , he suffered . It was a dreadful thing to him to see a man of Edward 's intelligence reach such a pitch of passion . What he felt actually was something like love , the kind of love that makes you slap a hysteric . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently . " If so , it 's the fault of people like you . You speak of intelligence . Have you any beyond the strict little field you have shut yourself up in ? After all , Ivan , you 're a citizen , are n't you ? " But as if Ivan 's tone had only really reached through to Edward after his answer , he leaned forwardsuddenly with his head in his hands . " Do this one thing for me , if not for yourself . It 's perfectly safe , " he added as if he had let himself show too much feeling . " We do n't speak the same language , Edward . You have no right to call me a coward . Let me explain myself . " Goldberg now was the one to stand and walk about the room . " If I give my name to your committee , I 'll be badgeredday and night by every other committee under the sun for any cause of the same kind . If I give my name , it will end by having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my work as an educator and a scholar is my real responsibility . I do not have time for extracurricular activities . That is final . " He stood with his back to the window , waiting for Edward to storm out of the room . But instead the man just sat there , hunched over , his head in his hands and for ap108moment Ivan had the fantastic illusion that he was crying . " You know there is no one I respect more than you as a scholar , Edward , " he said quite gravely , the little smile gone at last . IIe and Edward were so near to being friends , so near to crashing through the thin glass wall between them , that at this moment he felt that if he could only go over and put a hand on Edward 's shoulder , the glass would slide away . They faced each other . But when Edward lifted his head , his eyes were blazing . Not tears but a paroxysm of anger shook him , the more terrible because for once it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a hard time existing from now on , I mean scholarship which has some relation to the world in which it exists , " he said , hammering out each word . " Your book on Wallace Stevens , for instance ? " Goldbergfought back . Edward got up from his chair and stood there like a little bull . " It can hardly be written . But of course this is something you do n't know about " " I do n't carry the world about all the time like an unborn baby inside me , if that 's what you mean . " " Maybe it is what I mean . I 'd rather do that , ridiculous as it may appear to you , than do what the German professorsdid  --  wash my hands of any responsibility , let the Nazis take over , and then wake up in a concentration camp . You can still go your own way , Ivan . You 're lucky . . . . " There was no way now to get back to the moment when it seemed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little smile had come back to Ivan 's lips and he was icily polite.  | " I realize , Edward , that these emotional appeals  --  what is supposed to happen to a Jew at the mention of the word concentration camp  --  are usually effective . " " For God 's sake , Ivan , do n't be a fool . Of course that 's not what I meant ! " Now Edward was touched at the quick , and Goldberg had won . They stood with the room between them , and for the first time there was silence . Out of it Goldberg heard his own voice , charged with emotion , so that it surprised him as much as it did Edward . " Edward , come back , " he heard himself morbid sense of responsibility . You 're killing yourself , you 're using up your marrow , wasting very great powers . It 's tragic . " But Ivan could not keep the warmth now out of his voice . What was meant to be severe sounded like admiration . " Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly using up one 's marrow to make a simple request of a colleague . " It was Edward 's turn to score . " You looked exhausted when you came in here . " " So people say . As a matter of fact I came from a rather good seminar , a paper on Willa Cather . I was quiteeloquent . " Edward rocked on his heels , his hands still in his pockets . " Oh hell , " Goldberg said suddenly , " What 's the matter with us anyway ? When am I going to see some of the Stevens book ? " Goldberg and Cavan had been used to showing each other work in progress , counting on severe unrelenting criticism and enjoying it . This was their real relationship , and Goldberg was making an open gesture toward it in asking the question.  |p110Edward  's face clouded . " I 'm afraid never , " he said quietly . " You 're closing the door between us because I wo n't sign your manifesto ? I ca n't believe it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivan . Ca n't you see ? " " There 's no way to bridge the gap ? " " Apparently not . " " I ca n't believe it , " Ivan said half to himself , but at that second Edward opened and closed the door and was gone . Ivan could hear his voice in the hall apologizing to Perkins for the long wait . The damn fool should n't talk like that to a student , Ivan groaned . It 's not dignified . " Come in , Perkins , " he said in answer to the knock . " I expect students to be on time . You were more than a minute late . "  | " Come for a walk , Edward . I feel low , " Grace commanded on the telephone at nine o'clock the next morning . " There 's no concert , you know . The orchestra is gadding , but it 's our afternoon just the same . There might be a few late migrants still worth seeing at the cemetery . " She said all this in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because also she did not know really what mood she had interrupted . " I expect you 've done a full day 's work , already ? " " I 've been sitting in front of a blank page for two hours . Perhaps that 's work . " His tone was dry , faraway . She could sense the fatigue in it . " Well , it 's a lovely day and a walk will do you good , " she answered firmly . " We 'd better start at three . It gets dark so early . . . " It was clear that he did not want top112talk now , and once that was settled she hung up abruptly . But when she had hung up , she sat for some moments doing nothing , stroking Horace 's head absent-mindedly as he lay curled up beside her on the bed , half-hidden under the breakfast tray . " Iie 's coming , Horace , so we must n't be anxious , must we ? " she said , scratching him now under the chin , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it a moment in her hand . Little leather palm , she thought . It was such a soft yielding little hand for a moment , but then it withdrew itself quite firmly . " It 's a hell of a world , Ellen , " she announced when Ellen came in to take the tray . " Yes , ma'am . I expect it is , ma'am , " Ellen answered discreetly . She was tall , thin and ageless , and nothing Grace Kimlock said shocked her because she did n't believe a word of it . " Professor Cavan will be coming to tea , Ellen . We had better have some of those scones he likes and some of that ginger marmalade . " If love could find some way of expressingitself , she thought glumly . Ginger marmalade indeed . But lately she had been reduced to this sort of thing . Edwardis swimming out of my ken , she said to herself . I do not know really where he is , how to touch him . It was this that made the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up , Horace , " she said , " no point in brooding . " Her getting up made an earthquake of the calm island of the bed and Horace , offended , got down , gave a tremendous yawn , stretching himself full length , first one back foot then the other , and walked slowly and with great dignity to the door . The day had begun.  |p113It  might be a hell of a world , but it was a beautiful day , clear as a bell and cloudless , and so warm that Grace , armed with binoculars and a stick , needed no coat over her suit . By the time she and Edward were through the iron gates of Mt . Auburn cemetery the sun had reached just the point in its afternoon course when the slanting rays flowed through the blood-red dogwood leaves and the brilliant gold maples and set off each berry or sharply cut Japanese maple leaf in peculiar theatrical brilliance like a preRaphaelitepainting . True aficionados , they did not need to decide where to go , but walked without speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined with Grecian temples , or variations on the theme of the Greek temple , family crypts set into the hillside . It was like a small classical city , a slightly cluttered Claude or Poussin , as Edward had once remarked . " Why no one ever comes here , I ca n't imagine , " Grace said , her bright glancing eyes taking it in , the casual air of the planting among the white tombs , that mass of rhododendron , for instance , and in the distance a stand of pines . " It 's the most beautiful thing in Cambridge . " " It has everything  --  even a kind of society . " Edward smiled , as Grace took off with her usual insatiable curiosity to peer through the iron-grilled door into one of the tombs , where she could see a little iron chair sitting there in the dark beside a marble table . " Even a swallow 's nest , " she said , coming back in triumph . But it was all , she knew , slightly staged by both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many walks in every season , when they had been carefree , militant , happy  --  she stopped still . The word " happy "  |p114was  too dreadful really beside Edward 's haunted face . For her sake he was making a great effort to be genial and appreciative , as if she were giving him the cemetery this afternoon as a present and he must make appropriate thanks . But she knew without his telling her that he had n't slept , even as they walked on into a small dark valley , narrow and enclosed , so that the trees planted on the hilltopsoared to amazing heights , seemed to be about to take off into the sky . " Look at that oak , Edward ! What splendor ! " The words echoed back as she turned to him , standing passive , rooted , looking at the oak obediently , but not seeing it . " Yes , " he said , " it 's very fine . " But we can not talk to each other , she thought in a kind of panic . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banter about the tombstones , this " taking in " of every sight and sound had been like an accompaniment to the undercurrent of communion , and that was its charm . They talked about the trees and the birds , but what they were really saying was , " We can talk about these things because all the important things do n't need to be talked about . " Now the silence all around them seemed like a threat . They walked on the beautifully kept grass , side by side , and she felt a kind of panic as they left the open spaces and made their way through the pine grove , a narrow dark passage which would lead them out onto the two long ponds where families of wild ducks sometimes came for shelter , and to gobble at the floating green stuff . She had always loved these ponds , but now it seemed as if only damp and darkness and loneliness were there to greet them . Already the light was going , was leaving roots and stones in shadow , brilliant and warm only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say or do ? He walked ahead of her , his hands in his pockets and she followed , helpless as a dog . They had come , at the end of the two ponds , to a stone bench where it was traditional to sit down for a little while , traditional for Edward to take out a cigarette . The fact that he did not do so , but just sat there , was the worst of all . Grace nervously took out her binoculars and swept the trees as if they were tiers of boxes at the opera , but all she discovered was a junco . She had to make a great effort of will not to talk . She sensed that if Edward were to get some peace from this walk she must leave him alone , not pry and not gabble . " Are n't you going to smoke ? " she asked gently , after what seemed an eternity . " Yes , now that you speak of it , I think I will . " He was pulling himself back to her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you been doing with yourself ? " he asked , when he had lit his cigarette . " What have I been doing ? " She had the impression that she had chiefly been worrying about him , but she must think of something quickly . " Fosca came to tea , of course . I had lunch with an old Radcliffe schoolmate of mine . It depressed me . You would think she had never heard of an idea in her life . " " I expect you frightened her "  --  Edward made a stab at the familiar bantering tone . " Oh no , I was good as gold . I discussed the servant problem and the high cost of living for hours . " " So perhaps she thinks you never heard of an idea . " " Oh no , she ca n't think that , " Grace said , caught asshe always was by his bait . " I gave her a piece of my mindbefore she left . I simply had to , Edward . She was talkingp116such perfect nonsense , fantastic stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets it all from her husband , of course . " " People believe what they want to believe "  --  he got up  --  " that 's what it all comes to in the end . " They stood looking back a moment at the dreamy pond , at the long row of beeches reflected on one side , and the Gothic redstone tombs on the other , their roofs covered with long grass , even bushes . This was the oldest part of the cemetery , perfectly Victorian , before the Greek temple came into fashion . " How many times did we have to listen to the story of Roosevelt 's walking on the water ? People actually believed it , you know , " and he turned away , as if he were suddenly very tired . Even Grace felt subdued , tamed by his atmosphere of passive negation . They were moving out to one of the uglier and more crowded parts of this city of the dead , and Grace broke away to do something , anything to break the depressionwhich was creeping upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reading the names on the tombstones . " Good Lord , " she ejaculated suddenly , " here 's old Mrs. Bowditch . Whatever is she doing here ? " Then , as she saw the other names near by , " Oh yes , of course she was a Merritt , was n't she ? She must have wanted to revert . " She was astonished to hear , like a reprieve , Edward 's sudden amused laugh . " I expect we do tend to revert , " he said , still laughing , and then more soberly , " I wonder what I am reverting to " You 're too young to revert to anything , Edward , " shep117said in her natural tone of voice , acid and commanding . It really seemed as if they were coming out from a long tunnel . Just then , as if to make this sensation tangible , a male pheasant ran out from behind a rhododendron bush , stood for a second quite still , alerted , his head high , as Grace laid a hand on Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds , the bird 's wild bright glance , his standing there a few feet away in all his brilliance of red and gold and black , and then he was off with a little short run and a loud whirr and disappeared over the hillside . But they had had the vision . The excitement of it coursed through Grace like electricity . It released for her the words she had been holding back for a half-hour . Now she could say them , her hand still on Edward 's arm . " It 's all so beautiful , Edward , " she said in a rush . " And so short , really , " she added , meaning life perhaps . Then , quite gently , " I wish I could help . " " No one can help , " he said moving away from her , so her hand fell to her side , and it seemed a rejection . " That 's just the trouble . " He was not looking at her , nor did he see the tears which had started to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mine , Grace . " " Friends should be able to help each other . " She drank the shadows all around them like a bitter draught . All the light had gone up into the sky . They were in darkness . " But I 'm too old . Do n't say anything , " she said harshly . " It 's the truth . " She walked ahead of him now , very straight , up over the hill where they looked down on the large round pond , dominated by the circle of white columns which commemorated Mary Baker Eddy . " All those religions , " she said with contempt . " They 're no help either . "  | " Darling Grace "  --  Edward came up to stand beside her  --  " I have n't done much to cheer you up , have I ? " " That 's all right , " she flashed back at him . " I 'm a tough old bird . " She would not yield any further to destructiveemotion . And her eyes were eagle-bright now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anything to see ? " " I thought there was a duck in the reeds , " she said shortly . " I find ducks comforting . " " I never felt closer to anyone except my mother , " Edward said , " than I do to you . " Had she heard ? She turned and went quickly down the hill toward the broad road which would lead them out again . And he followed , his head bent , his hands in his pockets , as perhaps he had walked behind his mother when he was a child , dawdling a little , waiting for her to notice his absence . " Hurry up , Edward , " Grace called impatiently . " It 's high time for tea . " Edward sat with Horace on his lap stroking him absentmindedlyand looking at the cold hearth . It was really too warm for a fire , yet the absence of it made the room feel somber . " I wonder if I ought to get new curtains . " Grace looked at the heavy green velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , " he said quickly , " do n't think of changing anything . " His eyes wandered to the Sargent portrait of Grace with her mother , her mother sitting in the very chair where she sat now , and the little girl with flaming red hair and a narrow intense face standing beside her . " It 's a beautifulSargent , you know , one of the best . " She could seep119his interest flicker for a moment , like a fire which might light and might not . But at least she thought , he is really looking at something and taking pleasure in It . " I 'm leaving it to the Fogg , " she announced . " It 's so perfect against the gold walls , so perfect in this room , I ca n't imagine it anywhere else . " " Oh , I expect the house will be torn down , " she said gloomily . " It 's a white elephant , God knows . " " You are depressed , are n't you ? " " I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where on earth is Ellen ? " And she pulled the long tasseled cord energetically . " I really die every afternoon at this time . I just ebb away  --  " and she laughed a laugh which denied this altogether . " Oh you 'll not ebb away , will she , Horace ? " He scratched Horace under the chin affectionately . " She 'll go out like a burst of fireworks , a shower of gold  --  " he chuckled . Had a little ease crept in with the tea ? With the warmth , and Horace , and the whole familiar atmosphere of the room and the time ? Perhaps Edward felt it too , for he ate two scones and drank down his tea thirstily . " I forgot to have lunch , " he apologized , passing his cup back for the third time , and then as he sat there , suddenlythoughtful , but still relaxed , he said , " I have fought with nearly everybody I care about at all in the college . " He seemed bewildered , at a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . " You 're thinking of Damon " she hazarded . " No , as a matter of fact , I 'm going there to dinner tonight . Julia asked me . " " Oh good , " she breathed , fearful of overemphasis . " So that 's going to be all right . "  | " Is it ? " But he let that drop . Then he told her about Goldberg and his refusal to sign a petition about the Lode case . " Oh , Goldberg , " and Grace shrugged . What did he expect ? Horace , disliking the atmosphere of tension , now got up and flopped down to stretch out full length on the rug , showing the fine seam down his white stomach . Edward reacted violently to her dismissal of Goldberg . " Goldberg is the nearest thing to a great scholar we have in the department , Grace . You ca n't shrug him off . " " But he 's never been any help to us , surely . " " This is different . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could trust him about my work . I wanted him to look over the Stevens . " " Well , he can still do that , I expect , " she said drily . " No , I wo n't see him any more . I told him so yester-day . " " I see . . . . " In small , the University was the world . The same splits broke it into pieces , the same tensions were working inside it , like fine fissures which might suddenly gape . " No , you do n't see , " he said irritably . " You ca n't see . More than anything else that 's happened this makes me feel that I do n't belong in this community , Grace . I 've become a real outsider  --  Oh , these people mean well . They 're my friends , or imagine that they are . " He paused and then went on quite quietly and gravely , " But they seem really to be profoundly cut off from reality . It 's that . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been a small minority " Yes , perhaps . But that small minority represented thep121rising tide . We were part of something much larger than any small group inside the prison walls , and there were apertures in the walls . " " Well , there still could be . I do n't see that withdrawal is the answer . " It was her vital energy she pitted now against his apathy . It was not the words she said , but her very attitude , her essence which she brought into play . " I feel locked in , locked up , stifled , " he said . " It was different in Europe ? " She pushed him to remember , perhaps , the conviction , the warmth which he had brought back from that summer at the Salzburg Seminar , anything now that would wake the fighting man in him again . " Good God , yes . In Europe the intellectual is still part of life itself . I 'm tired of being a kind of governess without real responsibility , without dignity , someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whim of the employer  --  and who is only considered responsible as long as he is not responsible . They 're making eunuchs of us , Grace , that 's what it amounts to . " But though these were passionate words , the man who said them seemed to be whipping himself on to an emotion he no longer felt . " That could n't happen at Harvard , Edward , after all  --  I mean , about Lode . " " That 's it "  --  he turned on her with violence , with triumph  --  " that'sjust what Goldberg said . As long as it does n't happen at Harvard , all 's well . As long as it does n't touch us , it is n't real . " " Do n't be cross with me . I ca n't bear it . " She had wanted to call out his fire , but she could not bear it when it was directed at her . Everything might crumble aroundp122them , but Edward and she would stand fast together . And as long as they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cross with you , " he said quickly . " Forgiveme . But when he had left and Ellen came to take the tray and she said , " Well , he ate two scones , Ellen , that is something , " there was no comfort in the words.  |p123It  was absurd to be so nervous , Julia thought . She had changed her dress twice , searching frantically for the right note , neither dim nor spectacular , and now she was standing in her comfortable old gray chiffon , her one Paris dress , Vionnet , bought before the war . She stood there at the long mirror , pinning on a crumpled red velvet rose , but as she tried to open out the petals , she was not thinking about this , she was standing in the Hotel Louvois nearly fifteen years ago , and when the rose fell to the floor , she did not pick it up . It fell , and she let it fall , as the years had fallen leaving her now to stand here , marooned ( but only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Then they had been , it seemed , at the center of life . Everyone was in Paris ; Edward dragged Damon off to meet Blum , she remembered . They came back lit up , combative , Edward as usual with a refugee in tow . How many people did he helpp124that year with affidavits , money , above all , time , listening to the painful stories , pouring out warmth ?  --  How long ago it was . Another world . Damon had just got his professorshipand Edward was on the brink of beginning the big book , she remembered , stooping now to jab a pin into the floppy rose , but it was really too limp , better put it in the Morgan Memorial bag with the other odds and ends of life it was time to throw away . Is the roast burning ? She sniffed apprehensively and , forgetting to powder her nose , fled down the stairs . " Where have you been ? " Damon asked crossly . He was looking into the oven reproachfully . He was getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this for him , it made him so impatient . He was as prickly as a porcupine , and she felt at once that she must do something to change the atmosphere , but what ? " Well , I  --  I could n't decide what to wear , " she apologized . " It does n't matter , does it ? Edward wo n't notice . He does n't notice anything these days . " " It 's for myself , " she said quietly . " I need to feel armed . " " You look very nice , you always do , " he said , but without seeing her . " Damn these cubes , Julia . Why do n't they invent something ? " " Darling , go away , " she commanded . " I 'm nervous enough as it is . I 'll bring in the ice when Edward comes . " And then , as he stood there , his hands dripping , she handed him a towel and pushed him out by force . At least the roast was not burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh please , please let us be calm , she implored the air . Let us be kind . Keepp125Damon from getting angry . Make Edward understand  --  but the custard looked rather queer . And it was high time she carameled the sauce , too . We are children , she thought , lost in the wood . It is time we grew up , she thought , bangingabout in the kitchen drawer for that wooden spoon which always disappeared . But as she ladled the sauce in the immemorial gesture ( so she had watched her mother do it in the big sunny kitchen in Milton ) , she felt calmed . Calm welled up in her . We 'll manage , she told herself . We 'll find a way . For we really love each other . That is a fact . She clung to this fact . Can people who really love each other be divided ? The question lost itself in the delicioussyrupy brown mixture , just the right consistency , thick but not sticky  --  and then she heard the bell . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Darling Edward , " she said as she came in with the ice cubes a few minutes later . " Bless you for coming , " she said , carried forward on her kitchen thoughts so that she found herself kissing him . Then , embarrassed by what she had done , she explained , " I was thinking of Paris , 1937  --  do you remember ? It 's because of this dress . . . . " She sank down into a chair . " Of course I remember , " Edward stood with his back to the fire , his hands in his pockets . " It 's a charming dress , Julia , a work of genius " " It must be , if it 's lasted all this time , " and she sighed , sighed with pleasure , with relief , for it seemed as if the enormous tension of the last days had vanished , had been dissipated like a cloud . There was Damon , stirring the martinis and smiling , and there was Edward standing at the fire , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've never had another , have you ?  |p126And  we thought we would be so rich , at least I did . A professor 's salary "  --  suddenly he laughed  --  " what children we were ! " " It was a good time , " Julia said , as he handed her a martini . " You do n't need to feel so superior . " " A very good time , " Edward echoed and lifted his glass to her . " The year before Munich , " Damon turned to them from the little table where he had been mixing the drinks . " I wonder  --  was it really such a good time ? " Edward considered this for a moment . " No , " he said earnestly , " perhaps it was n't . But our star was in the ascendantjust the same . We were rising in that falling world  --  why do I say that ? " He stopped . " But there was solidarity , Damon , you must admit . And one felt useful . That summer in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another . " " You were inventing your book , " Julia broke in . " And then you went down to the Spanish hospital somewhere in the South , did n't you ? And all those German refugees  --  " " There was a reservoir of good will to be tapped . That 's what I really meant . People listened to one . " " Yes , " Damon frowned , " I suppose that 's true . But we were such children , Edward . We really were . " " And now we 've grown up ? " Julia asked lightly . " Julia thinks I 'll never grow up "  --  Damon ruffled his hair  --  " and perhaps it 's true . " " It 's the effect of science , " Edward teased ( this was an old war between them , a war of many skirmishes , safe skirmishes Julia thought with relief ) . " You scientists have always been children , you and your dangerous toys . " Julia hardly listened as the familiar tunes were played.  |p127She  drank her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's faces , the ever-changing weather in Damon 's , his eager flashing look , responsive not so much to Edward as to his own thoughts  --  and Edward 's , opaque , taut round the eyes , concealing ( so she sensed ) a permanent state of anguish . How could one help such a man , who was not able to talk about himself , whose personal dignity was such that , almost , it precluded intimacy ? While she thought these things , Edward had apparently changed the subject . They were talking , she gathered , about the strangeness and rarity in America of children 's living on in their father 's house , as Damon had chosen to do . " We did find it strange at first , " Julia reminded him . " At first I had every intention of changing things around , " she added , with a smile at Damon , " but I was n't allowed to . Even that stuffed fish in the hall , you know ? For years I was n't allowed to throw it away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said seriously . " I 've no doubt he did , but that did n't mean we had to live with the corpse for the rest of our lives . " But Damon did not really like to be teased about this family feeling he had so strongly , and it was time she thought of serving the dinner , so she got up , only pausing a moment in the door because she felt she must just hear Edward 's answer as Damon , wanting to change the subject , asked , " What was your father 's house like ? " The question gave Edward pause . He clasped his hands round his knees and rocked back and forth as he launched into an ironic description . " Oh , you know , golden oak , overstuffed furniture , glassed-in bookcases supporting casts of Greek statues with fig leaves applied , reproduc/tions of Botticclli in Florentine frames , little inlaid Persian tables  --  oh "  --  he rocked back and forth a moment , evokingit all  --  " and those glossy glazed brown tiles round the fireplace  --  Need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a parting thrust as she left them , " the bass was hardly a thing of beauty ! " But they were safely launched now and Damon would soon be talking about his grandfather . She could leave them . For the moment at least , anguish , division had been kept at bay . By walking very carefully they might be able to ignore it . Yet  --  it was there . In the old days they had not had to walk carefully , so Julia thought after supper when they had gone back into the study to have their coffee . And now , in the slight pause as for a moment no voice filled the silence , what was clear was the lack of something . The intangible bond which had made silence anotherform of communication was no longer there . Silence had become dangerous . " How 's your work going these days , Damon ? " The question was a polite one . It had been asked to fill the gap . Julia felt as if tiredness flowed out of Edward like a fog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injection , and turned to Damon , but all the time all around him was this fog . Yet he had enjoyed his dinner  --  perhaps that was why . He had relaxed , almost , had praised Damon 's burgundy , had seemed like a reasonable facsimile of his old self , just as the whole evening because of their united effort , was a reasonable facsimile of all the other evenings . Julia was not prepared for Damon 's answer . " I have n't been able to work for a week , if you mustp129know , " he said quite crossly . Then , as he caught Julia 's warning look , he added , " But I 've been stuck anyway , as a matter of fact . . . " Edward got up to hand his coffee cup to Julia for more . For a moment Damon 's words lay on the air , as if they had not been spoken . Edward seemed preoccupied . Perhaps , indeed , he had n't heard . Then , standing at the fireplace again , he faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , Damon . " " Oh , do we ? " Julia said quickly . " We do n't really , do we ? I mean  --  ca n't we just be peaceful ? It 's been such a happy evening , " she said , as if she were indeed bidding it now farewell . " Yes , we do . " Damon stood too , laid down his coffee cup and faced Edward . For a second she had the vision of two boxers eying each other in the ring . But no , it must not be like that . She must stand between them somehow , ward off the blows , prevent its happening . " I do n't know what happened at the Civil Liberties , " she said , standing and laying a hand on Damon 's arm , as if to prevent whatever was to happen if she could , " but surely your friendship is more important  --  and talking about it wo n't help , Edward . You know very well it wo n't . " She tried to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She might have been pleading with a stone . He was locked somewhere deep down inside himself . He was not to be touched . " Sit down , Damon , " she said almost roughly , " please sit down both of you . " This time it was a command . " I came here to say good-bye . " Edward did n't move . " No , " Julia 's voice rang out firmly , " you ca n't do that ,  |p130Edward  . It 's not fair  --  and what 's more it 's childish . One does n't break off a friendship like ours over a political disagreenlent . " She stood in the center of the room , and she was trembling with anger and revolt . " I do not honestly think it a strength , nor wisdom , to be as dogmatic as you have become , Edward . It 's too much like fanaticism . " Damon said this quite quietly  --  it was a sentence he had evidently been preparing in his mind . " This is a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectuals ca n't stand together now on principle , then it 's just too bad . " " Oh damn the intellectuals , " said Julia , " let 's be human beings . " " Exactly , " Edward turned to her . " As human beings we can not afford to start telling tales , snooping and spying on each other , writing letters assuring perfect strangers that none of our friends are Communists " " Some of my best friends are Communists , " Damon interrupted . He could not resist the joke , but it was a mistake . You do n't joke when a man stands up in your house , raw with wounds . " It 's not a laughing matter , " Edward said quietly . " It 's too serious , that 's why one has to laugh sometimes , " Damon said quite gently . " The great American pastime  --  laugh it off . Pretend it 's not real . But it is real , Damon , God damn it . I know . I say if you begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of principle . " " We 're not starting a witch hunt by writing a private letter to the ACLU executive  --  it 's just plain childish to say we are . " " I did n't come here to argue with you , Damon , " Ed/ward said wearily , flinging himself down into a chair and rubbing his eyes as if they ached . " Why did you come ? " Julia asked . : ' Oh , Edward , surely for friendship 's sake  --  ca n't we agree to disagree ? " Edward groaned , then said as if each word were a heavy stone and he were lifting them one by one , " Friendshipwithout solidarity is n't possible , Julia " You sound like a Party member , Edward " " I wish I were one , " the answer shot back fiercely . " I would n't feel so absolutely alone . " " But , Edward , it 's a loneliness of your own choosing , surely . You know we love you and honor you and want you always to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia said , helplessly . " It 's nobody 's fault , I expect . We 're locked up in separatejails . " But Damon had been thinking and now he made anotherattempt at reason . " Listen , " he said gravely , " we ca n't fight and win without making some compromises with things as they are . The Communist Party by being a kind of secret society has put itself outside the democratic procedures , Edward . You have to admit that . " Edward lifted his head . " Maybe . But I ca n't see that putting ourselves outside democratic procedures is any way to fight it . " " Of course . I could n't agree with you more . We do feel the same way , Edward , that 's what you wo n't admit . It 's as if you were deliberately cutting yourself off  --  why must you ? " In some way Damon had come through to a place where he could talk , where , Julia thought with gratitude , perhaps after all , they might reach safety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his head on his hands , belligerent , uncompromising , almost as if he could no longer listen to anything anyone might say . " I 'm cut off , " he said then , half to himself . " I ca n't find my way back to you , Damon . It 's no use . " If the silence that preceded this exchange had seemed to Julia to have the seeds of danger in it , the silence which now lay between and all around them had become danger itself . If it were not broken , broken soon , she thought  --  now , she thought  --  Come back to us , Edward , she said , but the words made no sound . " It 's like a nightmare , " Damon said suddenly , getting up and going to the window to stand with his back to the room , rumpling his hair in exasperation . " I 'm sorry . " Edward got up , lifted himself up with difficulty . " I 'd better go now . " " But where will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to bar his passage . " Going away wo n't help . " He would go to those bars in Scollay Square , she supposed , carrying his word solidarity like a banner which no one could see , drink with the sailors who called him Professor and treated him like a harmless drunk , walk the streets half the night , and then not sleep . " We ca n't let you go like this , Edward . It 's not possible . " She stood in the doorway , thinking , If I could touch him , take his hand , make the simplest human gesture . Why could n't she ? What was it in Edward that made such gestures impossible ? These thoughts flashed through her mind as they stood there , waiting for some miracle which would alter the moment , save . " I 'm sorry . " Edward looked at her now for the first time , a long look as if he had reached the point where it no longer mattered whether anyone saw what she saw orp133not . For what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed , only be pain . Then he pushed past her quite gently , but quite firmly , and they heard the front door close behind him . " Damon , do n't let him go like this . Run after him . Bring him back , " she said quickly and then sat down . " It 's no use . You know very well it 's no use . He wants to break away from us , God knows why . But he has to do it . That 's what I felt tonight . " " It 's as if everyone had gone mad , " Julia said in a tight dry voice . " I could n't say it . I could n't say any of the things I was thinking . I just could n't . " Damon walked up and down now , as he did when he was deeply disturbed . " What things , darling ? Say them to me . " But she was thinking , Edward is alone now . He is walking through the streets alone . He will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can say those things . " I wanted to tell him that people like him are necessary , that there have to be conscientious objectors , guardiansof conscience , there have to be the absolute people , and we honor them . But they are not the doers or the builders , in the long run , and I think part of Edward 's conflict is that he wo n't admit this . He wants really to be active , not a speaking conscience , but deep in  --  that 's why the word solidarity ' means so much to him . Only he ca n't be , just because he is what he is , noble , uncompromising , absolute . So he 's caught . " The words came fast now , and Damon was finding his release . " I wanted to go and hug him and take his hand , but I could n't , " Julia said . " Why could n't we ? " Tears streamed down her cheeks . She paid no attention ; they fell down herp134cheeks like Damon 's words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them . " Why ca n't love help ? " " We 've done all we can , Julia . " Damon flung himself down , his moment of lucidity , of understanding spent , and now only the exasperation , the tiredness , the sense of failure , ready to take over . " Love ? " he said bitterly . " Edward does n't know what the word means . " " No "  --  she blew her nose  --  " that 's not true . He ca n't give love or take it , but he knows what it means . He knows all about it , " she said , " that 's what 's so terrible . "  |p135George  Hastings did not answer his phone which rang ten times during the morning . He lay on his bed slowly , almostcontemptuously drinking down a bottle of whiskey . He had not bothered to dress . The shades were drawn . " Men ca n't stand too much reality , " he repeated from some poem , some play . Who had said it ? An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed to be the oral exam for the doctorate . Who said it ? " Auden , " he guessed , and met their pitying look . He knew very well that what was driving him to get completely blotto was shame . He had not been able to feel anything , you see , when Jack brought in the paper , white and shaken . I loved him , he was like a father to me , but all I could think of when I got the news was , Now I 'll never get that instructorship . This certainly shoots that to hell . Pretty fine specimen , I am , the great intellect , but no soul , he thought , taking ap138long drink . It tasted awful . He disliked it almost as much as he disliked himself . There was emptiness . There was shame . There was nausea . There was whiskey . There was nothing else . No Cavan . No feeling . That 's what Harvard added up to  --  no Cavan , no feeling . Just the intellect and waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Repeating the same words over and over , they finally becamejust words , unrelated to anything , discs with words on them floating round in the air . He had set up a cycle that he found he could not break , and suddenly he was terrified , shaking with fear , his pajamas dripping wet . He staggered out into the bathroom and glared at his unshavenface as if it belonged to an enemy . This was not himself , obviously , this sullen object of disgust . The image blurred , and George was sick into the basin . He was shaking so much then that he had to sit down . Very slowly the room came into focus , the mess of books on the table , the wastebasket overflowing beer cans and carbon paper onto the floor , and the pile of uncorrected themes which he had pushed aside as usual till the eleventh hour . George sat with his head in his hands and looked at it through the eyes of the truculent stranger he had become . Yet last night  --  far away down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered clearly , as one might remember some forgotten scene of childhood , he had actually begun to write . He had been filled with clarity and power . It had seemed like good work , focused , clear work , the best he had ever done . And while he was doing it , so concentrated , and deeply happy , Edward Cavan had been getting ready to throw himself under an elevated train . As he , George , felt the power shooting up in him like the green drive of spring in a tree , Edward Cavan hadp139cut himself down , and cut so much down with himself that now it seemed to George that half a century had passed and he sat , an old disappointed , self-disgusted man , stewingin his own failure . " The wind at my back , " he said aloud . Yes , it was that . The excruciating loneliness , as if the world he had set his faith on had just crumbled to pieces . " The bastards , " he said , " the dirty bastards . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had seen Professor Cavan once after their abortive talk at Albiani 's , had seen that the door of his office was ajar and stepped inside just for a moment , wondering if maybe this time would be the time when he could ask his question about a dinner engagement . For Cavan was sittingat his desk , his chair half turned so that he faced the window , and he was looking out , apparently waiting for a student , at any rate in an attitude unusually passive for him . When George spoke , he turned quite suddenly , startled out of whatever thought he had been thinking . " Oh , it 's you , George , " he said with a kind of relief . Then for an instant , but it was only for an instant , George had the sense that the walls of reserve which always stood between him and his man were shifting , and he caught a glimpse of something  --  such painful love , such loneliness that he had instinctively lowered his own eyes . It was as if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a question he did not dare ask , and that he , George , had something to give . The deep-set blue eyes had looked out like an animal 's eyes , pleading , George did not know for what . Yes , it was like an animal imprisoned . And George had looked away , had said something unimportantabout the last paper read at the seminar , as if deliberately to avoid a crisis he felt unable to meet . The wholep140thing took at most a minute . Then the student Cavan was waiting for turned up . It was in fact such an intangible experience that George might have buried and forgotten it , if two days later this man had not chosen to do away with himself . Now George knew that he must live through that moment again and again , examine and re-examine it , search it for clues . He felt as if his head were bursting , but he forced himself to get up , forced his shaking hands to run water into a coffee pot , to wash the dirty cup and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , he forced himself to shave , put on a clean shirt and trousers . Then , as if all this had banishedthe truculent terrifying stranger he had become , he made his bed and lay down on it , arms under his head , staring at the ceiling . What could I have done , he asked himself , if I 'd known what to do ? Nobody wants to look too deeply into an older person 's problems , especially into a teacher 's private problems . It seems slightly indecent . I suppose , George thought , he wanted something of me that he could n't ask , that I had to give . But I did n't give it . It was too big ; it upset my feelings about things . It broke down walls like breaking down houses . One could n't cope with such loneliness . I wanted his belief , not his love , his power , not his need . We 're all so scared of our feelings  --  there it was back again . The trap . The trap which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , naked feeling , that was his greatness , what set him apart . It was also , George guessed , what tore him to pieces  --  had he thrown himself under that train out of self-loathing ? Out of rage ? No , George turned over on his stomach pressing his head down into his hands to shut out the image . It wasp141too violent an image , it had no reality . It was quite impossible for him to put it beside the Cavan he knew . He could meet this reality at present only with revolt ' - it had to be shut out , thought away . The message found on Cavan 's desk had said something about " the state of the world . " But when they sat in Albiani 's and Cavan had tried to talk , how could George know how serious the whole matter was ? Was this preoccupation with politics Cavan 's strength or was it his weakness ? Was it strong to take an absolute stand which proved in the end untenable in relation to the facts ? Or was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him more , tried to understand , George groaned . How would he ever find his way out through the maze of questions now ? Who could help ? Everything had become nothing , for the pivot which held it all together was gone . The world had broken in two , not Edward Cavan . Edward Cavan was intact . He had let himself be savaged by an elevated train to remain intact , leaving the world all breakingto pieces , leaving the loneliness inside everyone else , the awful , bitter sense of failure and guilt inside everyone else . We ca n't get through to him now ; we ca n't share the burden whatever it was . It 's too late . This time George answered the phone . It was a woman 's voice he heard . The last thing he wanted was to cope with a woman . " This is Miss Kimlock , " the voice said . Then there was silence . " Yes , " George said cautiously . He had n't an idea who she might be . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded quite cross . " I 'm sorry . I was n't answering the phone . " Kimlock ?  |p142Kimlock  ? A relative of one of his students ? " What can I do for you ? " " I want to talk to you . I 'm a friend of Edward 's . . " George felt the silence growing like a paralysis . " Oh . " The silence was there again . How did one stop a si-lence ? " I just ca n't talk . " He hung up the receiver . It was brutal but he had to do it . I just ca n't talk , he said again . They ca n't make me . They think I have feelings because they do . They do n't know about the trap . Pen  --  the remembranceflashed through him like a wound  --  saying after he kissed her that she did n't want to feel so much . Cavan throwing himself under a train . The loneliness . No way out . " Edward ? " George laughed a harsh laugh . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Cavan . Get that ? Professor . I ca n't help you "  --  George said all this aloud to the empty room  --  " you 've got to help yourself . He was no friend of mine . "  |p143Damon  finally got off to his eleven o'clock class . Frantically nervous , he could not find his hat , nor his notes for the lecture , but at last after he had stalled the car twice , it hiccupped off and Julia was alone . Her hands dropped to her sides and she sank down into the leather armchair in the study , Damon 's chair . She picked up the newspaper , folded it together and laid it beside her , face down , so that the headline was out of sight . The room felt incredibly empty as if  --  with Damon 's electrical presence gone  --  it had been uninhabited for years , instead of a few seconds . There was a dank smell of tobacco , she noticed , but she had no energy to get up and empty ash trays . It was necessarysimply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pieces of herself , pieces of Damon , pieces of Edward . Until now she had been far too busy trying to soften the blow for Damon , trying to lift the burden of guilt he was carrying ,  |p144as  he repeated over and over , " We failed him . It was our fault , Julia . " Her whole will and energy had been bent for the last hours on persuading Damon that they had really done all they could . " If it 's failure , it 's failure of something far bigger than just we two , than just his friends , " she kept saying . " It was an act of violent rejection  --  of all of us . An attack , rather . Yes , an attack , " he said , running his hands through his hair so it stood up on end . And then he added , " It 's such a waste . " To think that we are part of a world in which such things happen , in which a man like Edward commits suicide . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls , at the photographs of Damon 's grandfather and of their two children . And for just a second she felt a kind of relief , as if they had come to the end of something , some long bitterly painful argument which had ( as indeed it had ) been going on for years . At least now there would be no more arguments . There might be a little peace . She was astonished at her own cruelty as she thought this . It was as if some aching conscience , which Edward 's presence had been , was suddenly stilled . No , she said to herself , a suicide is not a simple death , bringing peace with it . It haunts ; it asks a question . She saw that the argument had now gone down to a level where it would have to be fought not with reason , but with life itself . And fighting a dead man was a more complicated , a more painful affair than fighting a living one . It was no end , it was only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she suddenly felt faint . She sat very still , waiting for the dizzinessto pass . When it did pass , she lay back in the chair , her eyes closed.  |p145Until  this moment she had really felt nothing . She had been frantically racing along trying not to feel , trying to get to some intellectual rational plane where she could turn and face the feeling and not be overwhelmed . Now it pounced . It pounced because she suddenly saw Edward 's face very clearly , and as if for the first time , the long narrow forehead , the disarming reddish hair , the shy lonely eyes behind glasses and the queer tense mouth that could clamp shut so hard . It was solid like a piece of sculpture . Two nights ago this face was a real face ; it existed . Now it did not . Death , she thought : people just disappear . They are suddenly not there . He was here in this room , gentle and quiet at first , smiling at Damon 's oldest jokes brought out nervously for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her French peas ; he had all that time been carrying his death around inside him like a secret ; and they had not been able to get through to him , to hold him back . " Why is n't love enough ? " she asked the walls again , and each time she asked this question the same thing happened . She began to cry . It was like some awful wound inside her ; and now she had begun , she knew she would never stop , or so it seemed . But suddenly she sat up . She had remembered John in boot camp . She must write to John at once , quickly , before Damon came back and needed her . So it is that life pulls one forward , she thought ; there is no time to weep anything out ; there is always a human responsibility to pull one back from the abyss  --  but here she stopped on her way to her desk and stood quite still . What if there were no immediate responsibilityand one came face to face with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What then ? But I must telephone to Bess , she thought , at Bryn Mawr . I shall have to thinkp146all this out later . And what would she say to the children ? When they asked , " Could n't you do anything , Mother ? " What could she say ? He did n't trust us any longer , you see . He felt we were beyond the pale , out there in that alien world which was closing in on him . The enemy , in fact . No , that was not the thing to say to the children . They went forth to battle but they always fell ; Nobly they fought and bravely , but not well .. . What was it ? That old poem she had used to recite in school , the romantic appeal of failure . But this will not do , she thought , sitting down at her desk and again blowing her nose . She must summon the whole of herself and write to John . She must tell him . She must explain that such things happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a company of weak men , of cowards . She undid her pen . She must say it in such a way that Edward was not diminished in John 's eyes ; it is rather we who are diminished in our own . Yes .. . The letter was sealed and waiting on the hall table when Damon walked calmly up the path after his class . At once Julia knew by his walk , by the way he moved , at ease with himself , that his mood had changed . " Well "  --  he flung down his brief case  --  " I might as well not have bothered about that equation . I talked to the boys about Edward , talked for the full hour . It 's not a bad thing for physicists , even embryonic ones , to have to deal with a human equation for a change . " " What did you say ? " Julia was amazed , almost resentedthis man 's ability to rise like a phoenix from his own ashes over and over . For he had been abject when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph was written in his very stance . He had become an Olympian again , the great Professor Phillips . So quickly and with just a small exhibition before fifty students or so , he had won . He felt justified . For the students  --  oh she knew it well  --  were certainlygathered now in knots over their cups of coffee to praise Damon , to call him a great man . " I talked about the value of the dissenter in our society . I talked about Edward , not as a hero , but as a human being whose greatness was his humanity and his fallibility , and I talked , I 'm afraid "  --  here he smiled happily  --  " about the function of a teacher who combined scholarship and passion . Oh , well "  --  he ended , catching her eye and its cool appraisal  --  " I did the best I could for poor Edward . " " And you added of course that you were in political disagreement ? " she could not keep the irony out of her tone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Never mind , " Julia said quickly , " I 'm upset , that 's all . I 've been writing to John . " " Good . I 'll write him myself this afternoon . I 'm afraid this will be rather a blow . " This was Damon 's tone always about the children . They had never seemed quite real to him , perhaps , except as an afterthought . Or when in some way they reflected himself , won a prize at school , or showed some interest in him . Had he forgotten that John had said his one real grief at leaving college was to miss Edward 's course ? And Edwardhad written him a beautiful letter , such a humble letter , so full of love . It was in John 's breast pocket when he left . Actually , she remembered , Damon had been a little jealous of that letter.  | " Yes , do write to him . " Julia pushed the hair back from her forehead as if to push some thought away . " I must just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may save a few hours . " It was imperative now that she get out of the house , away from the urgency and weight of Damon . Now , for instance , he looked quite stricken suddenly , and begged her to come back very soon , not to linger . It was true that her presence supported him , that he needed her , but she felt herself stiffen . " Very well , " she said , " I 'll come right back . " " Get Grace for me on the phone will you , dear ? I really must talk to her . " He said it quite casually . As usual by yielding , she had become a kind of servant . " Do it yourself , Damon . I do n't want to talk to her . " The swing door to the kitchen swung behind her . She was safe in the kitchen , where no one would notice that she was trembling with anger . Expect her to call that arrogant old woman , indeed ! There seemed no barrier between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wore himself outside . But her inner conflicts were buried deep . Sometimes looking at herself in a mirror , she felt that she was caught in her body , lost too deep to be found or ever to come out . She envied women who could get angry , throw things . She envied Grace Kimlock , who , she knew , thought her a perfect fool . Someday , she had told herself for years , she would walk out of the house and not come back . But what she did was to take down a mixing bowl and prepare to make a dessert for supper . She could hear Damon on the phone , the amazing tendernessin his voice , " I know how it is for you , Grace  --  how it is for all of us , like the end of the world . . . . I haven'tp149seen anyone , except my students . I had to lecture at ten . " A note of reserve crept in . " Oh , she 's terribly upset , of course . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner ? " Of course . He would only let her go out for a moment , but he would leave her alone all evening . What is happening to me , Julia thought , frightened of her own bitterness ? This is not what Edward meant to do . We 've got to be more not less than ourselves now . We 've got to grow . But she could n't help being glad when it turned out that Grace could n't see Damon till tea the following afternoon . There was a meeting , it appeared , something to do with police brutality , and even the death of her best friend would not keep Grace Kimlock from going into battle , Julia thought with a grim smile.  |p150The  study in his house on Francis Avenue where Ivan Goldberg sat was so immaculate that it looked like a stage set . Even his desk was empty except for the leather-bound notebook in which he was now writing something . Even the books had no informality about them ; they were bound in sets , the English and American classics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could have walked out of this room and left no trace of himself , unless , as gossip had it , it was true that he kept a day-to-day journal in the manner of Gide . As chairman of the department , he had been on the phone all morning trying to arrange for various people to take over Cavan 's seminar and the three graduate students whose adviser he was . Fortunately , Edward had been on half time this term in order to work at his book . Nevertheless , it was a delicate business . His colleagues were all busyp151at work of their own and did not enjoy the idea of taking on additional tasks in the middle of the first semester , a low ebb in everyone 's energy , as Goldberg well knew . On a pad before him were five telephone numbers written in the hieroglyphic hand which so irritated students . He had called them all , but had found no one ready to take on the seminar . So he would have to manage that himself . But this was not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule in the notebook . He would , in taking over Cavan 's seminar , be walking into hostile territorywith his hands more or less tied . Very quietly then , he laid the book in which he had written down his new scheduleinto the right-hand drawer of his desk , closed it , and took out a cigarette . The geometries and abstractions of organization which were his private game against the demonswere all very well , but the moment came when they no longer helped . He had often noticed that the first effect of shock is anger . A child hurts himself on a chair and is furious with the chair , for instance . So his own first reaction had been to think , The fool , the utter fool to throw away his life , his work  --  He had said this to Angela who had just looked at him out of her quiet blue eyes and had not answered ; so now he was alone , utterly alone with his demons of selfdoubtand self-hatred . But why did he feel so terribly alone ? After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no one left whom I respect  --  it 's that , he told himself , and did not think it strange that he could also call the man he respected so much an utter fool . But he knew suddenly that his main reason , the inner compulsion to write his book had been that Edward would read it , this close analysis of seven great American works of litera/ture , at the opposite pole from Edward 's discursive book in which the background and growth of the writer had been emphasized at least as much as the work itself ; this was to have been an answer , more than an answer , part of a diptych . In the deepest sense the roots were intertwined . They had been all along working together , for Edward , he knew , respected him , believed in him , only was extremely , and perhaps rightly critical of Goldberg 's taking so much committee work . Lately Cavan himself had becomesomething of an outsider in college affairs ; at the same time Goldberg had become a power . But becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unfinished book which could now never be laid into Edward 's hands . He pushed away with a violent gesture the heavy desolation that seemed to be all around him in the air , that settled on the books , that filled his lungs and made him suddenly choke . It 's no good , he thought , none of this is the point . I failed him . It is worse to fail an antagonist worth your mettle than a friend . There had been a moment there in the dingy study at Warren House only three days before  --  or when was it ?  --  when if he could have made a really human gesture , he and Edward might have come to terms , might have allowed the love buried so deep under their antagonism , to flow out . Admitting this now , knowing it to be the truth , pain and grief took possession of Ivan Goldbergso intensely that he walked up and down hugging himself with the force of it . Why could n't I ? What is wrong with me that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am always so afraid of giving myself away ? And what did it mean to be respected and feared if one was not loved , could not be loved because one was not lovable ? Edwardp153had been loved , God knows . Difficult , rude as he often was out of sheer passion , this rudeness was always forgiven because it came from passion , whereas the smooth hard surface he , Ivan , presented to the world was unforgivable like the barren fig tree . " It 's too expensive to keep the door open , Ivan , ca n't you see ? " But it was I who shut the door , not he  --  and all the time there was Edward right beside him in the room , alive . " Oh God , " Ivan tore out of the study and up the stairs to find his wife . Angela was reading aloud to Cissy who was in bed with a sore throat . For once Ivan hardly noticed Cissy whose face always lit up in such an enormous smile when she saw her father . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . " Daddy 's crying , Mummy , " the clear piping voice called after them . " Do n't cry , Daddy . " Angela , soft , warm , pretty Angela had never seen her husband cry . He was sitting in the hall on a hard bench in the window , hugging himself as if he had a pain , shaken with sobs . She stood beside him , not daring even to put a hand on his shoulder , as if , bowed over , hugging himself , he had become suddenly majestic and unknown like a god . " It is n't your fault , darling . " Ivan pulled her to him then , driving his head against her belly as if to bury himself there . Very gently she stroked his springy black hair and waited . The tense rackingsobs finally came at less regular intervals , and his hold on her , which had been painfully hard , relaxed . But still he said nothing . They were not people who communicated by words , but by the invisible waves of feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  s  --  sorry . " Ivan blew his nose on an immaculatelinen handkerchief . " I 'm afraid I frightened Cissy . " In a second he was on his feet . " She 's very quiet . " They found her sitting up , tense , her enormous dark eyes going from one to the other fearfully . Ivan went over and sat on the bed where he could put an arm around her , could explain that people had to cry sometimes , even grown-up people . " Why do they ? " she asked , turning to look at him with immense curiosity . " Because they 'll burst otherwise . " " Why will they burst ? " she persisted like an inquisitor . " Because "  --  he hesitated , then bowed his head before his child  --  " they 're so ashamed . " " Do n't do it again , Daddy , " she said firmly . Do n't do it again , he said to himself as he went down the stairs and back to his study to try to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he had learned this long ago  --  the drug that never failed . When Angela brought in his lunch on a tray , he was so absorbed that he did not even lift his head . The seminar was to meet at two . He had thought at first that he would simply have an announcement posted . But that , he knew , was evasion . It would be better to get it over with , once and for all . So , at precisely ten minutes to the hour , he put on a light overcoat and walked briskly down Kirkland Street toward the Common . It was a cruelly brilliant day ; the dazzling light hurt his eyes . And he looked at all this as if he had become a stranger to it , a stranger to the immaculate thrust of the chapel steeple against the bright blue sky , a stranger to the uneven brick pavements of this , his Cambridge , the barberry bushes framing longp155green lawns , the Greek revival houses which the college was taking over one by one . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes . He had come here fifteen years ago for his doctorate , a year or two after Edward Cavan had moved over from Columbia . Those were the days of their long argumentative walks , when he was the outlander and Cavan the insider , and for Ivan the irregular bricks after the hard cement paths of Urbana seemed like the pavement of Heaven . Gradually in those fifteen years he had absorbed Cambridgeand made himself part of it , with the big house on Francis Avenue the final stage of taking possession . He could not imagine life without the Charles River , without the ugly black-faced clock on Memorial Hall , without the queer bare spaces of the Common which he was now crossing , where children rubbed smooth the cannon , and no one perhaps but Ivan Goldberg remembered that it was Lincoln who stood in the middle of the high Civil War monument . But now today these familiar and consoling sights were no longer his . They observed him as if he were a criminal . He felt at bay . This made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He failed to greet a former student who gave him a tentative smile and saw the smile vanish . Appleton Chapel rang two as he pushed open the door of Longfellow Hall at Radcliffe . He was annoyed to find he was slightly out of breath and took refuge in the bleak instructor 's room with its empty fireplace , its memorialplaque and smell of dead cigarette smoke . Here he forced himself to wait nine minutes . Then he climbed the single flight of stairs and faced eight men sitting round a long oval table . He knew that he was smiling faintly as he always didp156when he was nervous . He knew the effect this would have and did have . " My name 's Goldberg , " he announced briskly as he sat down . They introduced themselves one by one , Kovarsky , Mead , Zausmer , Herrera , Keith , Hastings , Servi , Anangnos . Then there was silence as Ivan Goldberg laid his brief case on the table , took from it a folder marked Seminar , American Lit. and said , " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall we begin ? " It would have been appropriate , it was necessary that he say a few words of introduction , that he break the atmosphereof hostility by some reference to Edward Cavan . But he simply could not do it . It was clear to him that if he even spoke Edward 's name , his voice would break , he would disgrace himself and be unable to go on . So in pure self-defense he talked brilliantly about the paper , which was an analysis of the early realistic novels of Howells . He did it the more brilliantly because he did it without mentioningCavan 's name . As he left the classroom he realized that his shirt was soaked through . " He 's a cold fish  --  " This much he heard as the door closed behind him.  |p157The  night had been so strange , so terrible since one A.M. when the phone had summoned him out of a deep sleep to identify Edward 's body , that Orlando Fosca felt lifted up and borne deep on the tide , a tide so powerful that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved through the interminable processes , going to Edward 's apartment with the police , finding and reading his last statement , telephoningIsabel Ferrier in California , trying to preserve what he could from the reporters , like an automaton . Then he had gone home and sat for hours in his chair in a state of extremewakefulness . It was as if an explosion had taken place inside him and he were no longer an old man , but already dead himself and so beyond fatigue , almost beyond grief in any human sense of the word . His landlady had kindly brought him some lunch on a tray . Then perhaps he had dozed off . At any rate it was quite suddenly time for him to go over to Grace's.  |p158He  stopped for a moment to look at the chestnut on Brattle Street , his old friend , one of a pair in front of an old house . A branch had fallen in a storm a few days before , and the wound was still there , a naked white gash , though the broken wood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensely he wanted to see the wound closed , tarred over . So anxious about it was he that more than once he had had to restrain an impulse to ring the doorbell and inquire after the tree , make sure that some concern was felt , that surgeons would be sent for . He had known this tree in its splendid baroque flowering , in its summers of openhanded leaves , in its fruitful falls dear to the children , for so many years . Now standing here , in his hallucinatedstate , he poked a fallen chestnut with his stick till it cracked open to show the bright brown nut inside . And in doing this it was as if his self , which had been floating somewhere beyond reality , came back into him with the force of shock  --  and with it the full human burden , the full weight of what would be expected of him when he reached the indomitable old woman who waited for him now and whose heartbeat he felt as if in his own pulse . When he reached the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed open the door as an impetuous young man might have done , went right to the drawing room where she was standing with her back to the fire , and pressed her to his heart . Grace , who had been erecting barriers against her grief all day , was taken by surprise . She would have none of the earthquake of emotion which Orlando 's unexpected gesture unloosed . She disengaged herself stiffly , turned her back on him , and said rather gruffly , as if the episode hadp159not taken place , " Where 's Ellen with our tea ? " He watched the quick angular stride , the decision of her as she pulled the bell cord , watched her with admirationand a slightly disillusioned smile . He had made a huge effort  --  now it was done he knew how huge  --  to raise his exhausted self to meet her in the fullness of their friendship , and she had been unable to receive his gift . Strange fascinatinglittle person who , so avidly hungry for life , consistentlypushed it away and hid herself from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked enough , stripped down to the quick . " I tried to get hold of George Hastings , Edward 's student , you know  --  he did n't even know who I was , " she said irritably . " He refused to talk , hung up on me . It was most extraordinary . " " Do you think so ? " Orlando asked with slightly barbed gentleness . " Do you really think so ? " The tide of feeling was ebbing away in him now . He felt so shaky that he sat down . " Yes . " She looked down at him , her eyes blazing , but was it grief ? Was it anger ? " I do think so  --  under the cir-cumstances . " " Probably he could n't talk . People react in different ways , Grace . Poor boy , " and he sighed . " He was rude , " she said inexorably . " Desperate people are often rude , my dear . " And now it was his turn to flash her a severe look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipped in like a beneficent shade . Orlando was touched to see that she had obviously been weeping . " It 's hard for us all , Ellen , is n't it ? " he said gently.  | " Yes , sir . " She broke into a sob as she disappeared down the hall . " Ellen is a fountain of tears , " Grace said sharply , as if she were not at all pleased by such exhibitions of feeling . She busied herself with pouring out his tea exactly as he liked it , with passing a plate of very thin bread and butter . She did not look at him , and he wondered how long she would be able to maintain her defenses , how long on this strange afternoon he would find himself regarding her as a psychological curiosity , rather than as his oldest dearest friend . For the moment it was clear that she wished everything to be as usual , the occasion to be framed as far as possible in the safety of gestures and habits which had been going on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestures had now lost their meaning , lost the content which made them nourishing ; they were empty gestures . It seemed to Orlando that this room , where nothing had changed since the days of Grace Kimlock 's father , were flying apart , and in a more subtle and frightening way as if he and his old friend were at such complete crosspurposesthat they might as well be flying apart . " Light the fire , there 's a dear , " Grace said in a gentler tone . " It 's chilly here . I feel old and cold , Orlando , " she said as if the thought of old age had never before crossed her mind . The fire helped , as a matter of fact . They could sit and say nothing . The fire spoke ; they could listen to its language , watch the Cape Cod lighter flame up blue , and the pleated fans of paper blaze and enfold the birch logs in a sheet of brightness . They drank their tea . Then Grace leaned forward , her hands clasped before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself set up.  | " Why did he do it ? " This was the question she had wandered crazily through the day asking and asking and searching for an answer . She had gone for a long walk by the river , had tried to read , had climbed up and down the stairs a hundred times as if to search for a small lost object , her glasses or a thimble . Now she flung the question at Orlando , and he saw the flush creep up in her throat with the force of it . " I do n't know , " Orlando said quietly . He passed his cup absent-mindedly for more tea . " You must know . You must tell me , " she said fiercely as if he were willfully withholding information . When she had poured his tea and handed it to him , she looked into the fire and murmured , " How could he do this to us , Orlando ? that 's what I ca n't understand . I 'll never forgive him , never , " she said without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had ceased to have a meaning . " It does n't matter now . " Orlando passed a thin hand over his forehead and held it there over his eyes . " It matters to me , very much . " " No doubt it does . But we wo n't get the answer now , or perhaps ever , Grace . " It did not help at all , but Orlando was now thinned down by fatigue to the point where there was no excess kindness in him , only the bare bones of the truth . " This is not a simple matter . We shall go on living with it for the rest of our lives . " " I ca n't , " Grace said , " I 've got to know . " " And if you ca n't know  --  for knowing really means beingEdward  --  what then ? " " I 'll die , " Grace said simply . This , Orlando thought , is what it is to be young , thisp162absolute quality , and for the moment he found it peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How well did you know Edward ? " " You sound like an inquisitor , " she said nervously . She had never seen this stern Orlando before . " You know very well that Edward was like a son to me . " " Do mothers really know their sons ? " he asked inexorably . " Do n't you understand , Grace , that what you were to Edward was one fixed point , was a sort of security  --  yes , like the security of a parent , perhaps . You agreed about all the important things . " " Well , did n't that make us close ? " " In one way , yes . But who were Edward 's lovers , if he had a lover ? " " I do n't know . " " Of course you do n't . And neither do I. Do n't you see ? There are whole areas of Edward 's life that we never touched , never could touch . " " People like Edward Cavan do n't commit suicide for love  --  a man of fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She triumphed . " No , perhaps not . But in a conflict so terrible that it ends in suicide , the whole person is engaged . You 'll have to admit that . " " Decent people do n't commit suicide . " Grace took refuge again in her anger . " Perhaps not , if you regard suicide as a crime . Do you ? " Orlando was relentless . " I do n't know "  --  and she flung up her hands in a gesture of unwilling abandon . " You 're no help to me , Orlando  --  and I thought you would be . " There was no gentleness in her voice . " I 'm a wounded man , " he said stroking his beard rhythmically . When he did this it was always a sign of great agitation , as if he calmed himself as one might calm a cat . " Do n't badger me . " She shook her head as if to shake something off . " It 's like a nightmare . Nothing will ever be the same again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long French windowsand looked out . " Nothing will ever be the same again . " Animals are the only comfort , " came the relentless anguished voice behind him . As he turned , Orlando saw the room , which had been flying to pieces , slowly focus on the bowed old figure , her hands clasped under her chin , and knew how dear she had become to him in the last few minutes of war . " How is Horace ? " he inquired and it meant , It 's all right . Somehow we 'll survive this together . " Horace is all right , indifferent , beautiful as always . " But the words did not carry the meaning , as they exchanged a smile , as at last they reached the moment of communion , and Grace leaned her head back against her chair and closed her eyes . " I do n't know what I 'm going to do , " she said in a matter-of-fact voice , not bothering to catch the single tear which slid out and rolled down her cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think Edward will be with us for a long time tocome , " he said gently . And then , " The dead help the living . " She opened her eyes and sat up straight . " How ? " " I do n't know how . I 'm not a mystic , as you know , myp164dear . I do not believe in anything like tangible presence "  --  he drew in his breath as if he was in physical pain  --  " and in this case a tangible presence would be a tormented one . " " It was such a dreadful way to do it , Orlando  --  so brutal , " she murmured , following his thought . It was not an interruption . He passed a hand over his forehead . He had seen what she had not seen . He found that he was sweating . " I think perhaps it is that death leaves us the essence of the person , " he said , but it had become a great effort . At the moment he was nowhere near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not of horror  --  it was not like that . But the sense he had , when he looked down at the calm empty face above a body cut in two , that Edwardwas not there , that this was not Edward . " What was Edward 's essence ? " she whispered . " We ca n't know yet , " he answered quickly . " It will take time . I can only tell you that after Sylvia died it was more than two years before I could get past the image of her suffering , before I could even think of her as she really was . It takes time , " he said again , stroking his beard . At Sylvia 's name , a name Orlando so rarely mentioned and only under the stress of such a moment , Grace turned to him and perhaps for the first time looked at him , really saw him , sitting there , his eyes sunk so deep into the bone from tiredness that he looked like a very old man . " I 'm an egotistic old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drily . " My dear , you must go home and get some rest . I am going to get Ellen to pack up a little basket that you can take home for your supper . You must forgive me , " she said again , as she got up to go to the kitchen.  | " We 're old friends , " he murmured , but she had already gone . When at last Orlando Fosca closed the door behind him and was safely back in his study , he sank down into his armchair , loosened the laces of his boots , leaned back and closed his eyes . For a few moments he gave in to the sense of total dizzy exhaustion , to the relief of being here alone , of not having to go out for supper ( kind of dear old Grace to have thought of that soup ) , of not having to brace himself or to consider others . Damon had agreed to meet Mrs. Ferrier 's plane . For a few hours at least his responsibilitieswere at an end . The image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its great open wound . Something , perhaps , could be done about that tomorrow . He opened his eyes and looked about him , at the familiar wall of books on his left , at Grace 's ridiculous penguin in its glass globe , and lastly at the small round photograph of his wife as she had looked when he first met her , the radiant young face framed in fair hair , the large sensitive eyes , eyelids drooping a little , the ghost of a smile . Thinking of her , as it always would , opened the deep reserves of feelingand it swept over him , with a force that made him lean forward and groan , what Edward 's loss would mean to the University . This was the great tree standing with a limb torn off , bleeding into the air , that branch rich with leaves and flowers which would never grow back again , never bear its real fruit , that branch which had just fallen with a great crash . And Fosca smiled at himself , recognizing that in spite of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a different way but no less than he had loved his wife . " We ca n't do without Edward , " he saidp166aloud , hatred not love in his tone , for he hated the smug safe scholars who remained , who would never kill themselvesbecause they would never be stretched as Edward had been on the rack of conscience . An Olympian , Edward called him , for he had accused Fosca of being too detached . But whatever virtue there might be in such a stance went out of it if the only struggles one watched from the heights were the petty struggles for advancement , the jealousies over honorary degrees , the endless playing for position which was one side of University life . Edward had transcendedall this by sheer passionate intensity . " We ca n't do without him , " Fosca said again . What would Edward have been if he had not tied himself to the rack ? " He would be alive now . " Fosca heard his own groan and sat up . Would he ? But Fosca took back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can not wish the people one loves to be other than they are . An Edward not torn to pieces , an Edward concerned only with literature , would seem a monster . But standing was not the thing , and he sat down again heavily . The room which had seemed so friendly a moment before , now loomed about him , full of enemies . These objectsthat do not run down , he thought , glancing again at the self-satisfied penguin in its eternal snow , become our enemies . It was queer the desire he felt to go and smash the penguin.  |p167Damon  and Julia had been sitting now for half an hour in the waiting room at the airport , unable to relax for a momentas every few seconds a loud voice on the public addresssystem told them that the Paris flight was now ready and would passengers please assemble , or that there would be a short delay for Chicago . Each time this happened they stopped talking and wondered tensely if this time the announcementwould be that Edward 's sister , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was finally about to land . " Sit down , Damon , " Julia said irritably , as once morethey were disappointed . " You 'll wear yourself out . " " I 'm worn out , " he answered . " This is the last straw . " " I do n't suppose she 's exactly looking forward to thiseither , poor woman . " " Edward despised her , " Damon said impatiently , rub/bing his face with his hands as if to rub out the fatigue . " You remember his acid descriptions of the house , the high fidelity atmosphere , and her smug husband , the perfect picture of middle-class indifference and selfishness , both of them . " Julia sighed . There was no point in arguing with Damonwhen he was in this contrary mood . Better save one 's strength . She concentrated instead on watching the minute hand of the clock on the wall inching its way towards halfpastten . With every second of waiting she felt a greater longing to be anywhere but here , in this brightly lit limbo , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no mercy here . " We are pitiless , you know , " she said . " Number Five , Number Five . " Damon lept to his feet again . " The St. Louis plane is now landing . " Was this it at last ? Could it be possible ? Damon dashed off to make sure , then signaled her impatiently to join him at the gate . It was all happening more quickly than seemed possible . A man with a brief case pushed in past them ; then three excited young girls wearing orchids ; what if they failed to recognize her ? Julia pressed Damon 's arm . There was no other woman alone . She was extremely elegant , Julia noted with surprise , pushing back a strand of hair , wishing now that she had thought to wear a hat . " Mrs. Ferrier ? " Damon asked . " Yes  --  are you "  --  she hesitated , searched for a name , gave up with a shy glance at Julia . " I 'm Damon Phillips . This is my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , has no car , and besides he is quite exhausted , as you can under-stand. "  | " It 's awfully good of you to meet me , " she was saying , " I 'll just see about my bags . " " Give me the checks . You and Julia sit dpwn . " Damon ran off impressed , Julia sensed , by the smooth elegance beside her , the air of unobtrusive luxury , the soft silvery gray fur wrap , the slim ankles . Damon , as susceptible as a boy , had evidently already reversed his judgment . " Your husband is a professor ? " Isabel interrupted her train of thought . " Yes , physics . " " Oh . " " I do n't understand anything about it , " Julia smiled reassuringly . " It 's all a mystery . " " My husband is a surgeon . " Julia noted the slight lift of the chin , was faintly amused . Surgeons in Isabel Ferrier 's hierarchy were evidently superior to professors . " So Edward told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us often ? " The bright gray eyes looked frightened , and Julia , seeing the fright in them , answered more warmly than truthfully , " Of course . " Thank goodness Damon was coming towards them now with the bags and this subject could be dropped . It was a relief to get out of the garish light into the dark car . Isabel took out a cigarette and offered Julia one . They sat together in the back seat . " Damon is the worst driver in the world , " Julia said , as he stalled the car for the second time . " All we can do is try to relax and count on the innocent 's luck . It 's flooded , darling , just wait a minute , " she said to Damon 's back . " Oh be quiet , Julia , " he said crossly . " You make me nervous . "  |p170Isabel  felt she had been catapulted in the last five minutes into a world as strange as the moon . Anyone could tell that Mr. Phillips was a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his thin uncombed hair falling down over his forehead , his face all broken up by lines , his air of agitated incompetence . Henry would have a fit if he imagined she was being driven by a man who stripped the gears every time he changed speed and turned right round in his seat every few minutes to look behind him . But she was not nervous . She was too excited , peering out into the strangeness , a limbo of factories with glimpses of water seen through neon signs , and even once a ship tied up apparently in the middle of a city block . It was really too queer to be here , driving along through the night with two perfect strangers , uprooted from everything familiar  --  the plane had become a kind of refuge in the last hours  --  but here she was nowhere . She wondered if she would ever get back to Henry , he seemed so far away in the sunlight where everything was natural and good . They had just crossed an immensely high bridge and now swung out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out things to her , continually admonishedby his wife to pay attention to the road , and for a while Isabel had no time to think . " That 's Boston over there ? " she asked , amazed that it could look so brilliant , reflected lights in the river , all shining and beautiful like a city in a dream . But then that too was gone and quite suddenly Damon was swerving into a driveway , grating to a stop , and they had arrived . " We thought we 'd bring you here for a nightcap , so it would n't feel too strange , but you 'll sleep at the hotel justp171around the corner . We thought you might rather not be a guest , feel quite free , " Julia was saying as they walked up the steps of the porch . Then Isabel was inside the house , so different from any house she had ever seen , slipping her coat off , as she slid down to the edge of a wornout leather armchair with tufts of white cotton batting showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sepia photographs of an old man who looked like a minister and two seascapes in big ugly gold frames . Her hosts had gone into the kitchen to get drinks , she supposed , for she could hear a murmur of voices and the sound of ice cubes falling out of a tray . She looked down at the table beside her , where a pipe lay on top of a pile of magazines she had never heard of  --  Nature , Science , The London Economist . In a room where everything else made her uncomfortable , she turned gratefully toward the fire . She felt very dazed . I 'm so dreadfully ignorant , she said to herself , to be Edward 's sister . It was a strange thought , one she had never had before  --  ornot since she was a child . In it she recognized that here she came as a representative , for Edward 's sake , not for her own . And she was frightened , wished for a second that she had not come , or had pleaded fatigue and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could look for the bathroom and escape for a few moments . When she came downstairs again , she found them waiting for her , Julia stretched out comfortably with her feet on a hassock , Mr. Phillips standing with his back to the fire . " You must be dreadfully tired , " Julia said , at the same time as her husband was saying , " There 's a drink there besideyou . " " Sit down , Mrs. Ferrier , and relax , " Julia was saying.  | " I ca n't , " Isabel confessed . She sat on the edge of the chair , in a state approaching panic . " It 's a terrible ordeal for you , all this . We 're so sorry "  --  Damon 's cigarette wagged up and down grotesquely in his mouth . She had so dreaded these hawk faces , the faces of the intellectuals , the enemy . Now that she saw they were kind , not like Edward hammering at her all the time , she turned to Damon with childlike relief . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , taking a swallow of her drink . " Edwardpushed me out of his life long ago . " The words were so entirely unexpected coming from the woman who spoke them , that Damon peered at her with something like embarrassment and then glanced over at Julia as if to say , You handle this . " He was n't easy on any of us , you know . He was n't an easy person , " Julia said . Would it , after all be possible to talk ? Isabel felt as if she were carrying a tremendous burden alone , had been carrying it for years . Was it possible that here in this unlikelyroom she could lay it down ? " I suppose I always hoped that things would change , that he would change  --  or something  --  and now I ca n't get used to the idea that they wo n't , that . . . " She could n't finish . The words were all mixed up . And she was grateful for their silence , gratefulthat they did not rush in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most natural thing in the world to be silent . " We know so little about him , really , " Julia said into the fire . " But at least you talked the same language , " Isabel said quickly . " Edward and I have hardly talked at all for years . He hated everything about my life . Yet I 've beenp173waiting , having nightmares , dreading this always  --  it seems to me  --  lying awake at night . It sounds crazy , " she said . She was almost frightened of the sensation of release . She must not talk too much . She must be careful , said the little voice inside her which made her wear gloves to lunches . " We 've all been anxious about him . We 've all felt helpless , " Julia said . " That 's what 's so awful . " Isabel took a long drink , then settled back in the chair , and for just a second closed her eyes . To close her eyes was like drowning , and she opened them again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under , sucked down into places where she would lose all selfcontrol . " But you were part of his life , " she said , " he had n't given you up  --  " She stopped because she caught the look in Damon 's eyes , the look of guilt , of acute distress . " He walked out of this house four nights ago , " Damon said almost angrily . " We had been friends for years . " " Poor Edward , he could n't help it , " she said without quite knowing why . " What makes you say that ? " Damon pounced on her now , and for a second she felt the piercing glance , the glance she had been afraid of , probing her , demanding reasons for what she could only feel , not know . " I do n't know , " she said , " but it seems as if Edward was like a coiled spring all the time , coiled so tight , it just did n't break . " " Yes , " Julia murmured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was remembering these afternoons when he had come as the light was going and sat for an hour with her at teatime , and how the tension in the darkening room grew and grewp174till he would suddenly get up and go , without a word , leavingher feeling weak as if they had been engaged in some terrible battle . You know , " Isabel turned to her gratefully . " Sometinusit was as if the spring turned backwards , he was caught in it "  --  she stopped to clasp her hands together nervously  --  " I 'm no good at saying these things , " she said . " On the contrary , " Damon said . She was aware that he was listening intently , that in some extraordinary way she had after all , something to give . " It was a kind of black anger  --  like beating your fist on a wall . And he used to do just that when he was a boy . No one could reach him or touch him , not even Mother , at those times . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy he used to get into fights , I mean physical fights , in those moods . Then when he was older and he could n't do that , it was another kind of destruction . He broke off with me when Mother died . " She felt their close attention around her like a shield . She knew that they really cared , cared quite differently from Henry who had simply written Edward off as a hopeless neurotic  --  as if that solved anything . " You see , " she said , looking over at Julia , meeting the compassion in her eyes like a balm , " we did n't tell Edwardthat Mother was dying . He never knew , because he was at Oxford and Mother wanted him to have that year . But when he got back and she was dead  --  well , it was the end of us as a family . It was the end of Edward and me , " she said , and at last she was laying the burden down . " I still do n't understand it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were a fire , and he was standing at the open window  --  I ran and held him with all my strength and said , No , Edward . You ca n't . It 's the black/ness  --  you know Mother called it the blackness '  --  and then he pushed me away and fell down on his bed and cried . But he never forgave me . " She took a long drink . " I 've never told anybody all this . It 's so queer I should be telling you . I was so afraid of you " " We were rather afraid of you , as a matter of fact , " Damon said gently . " Why ? " " We thought you were a stranger , " Julia broke in warmly . " We did n't know . " " I do n't believe in any of the things Edward believed in . You probably know that , " Isabel said . It was a relief to say it . " But you believed in him ? " Julia asked . Isabel turned this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drink , or of the plane , or of sheer exhaustion . " No , " she said , " I do n't think I could . He hurt me too much . " Julia got up . " We 've kept you up long enough . Damon , you really must take her to the hotel and let her get some sleep . You 've given us a great deal , you know , " she said laying a hand on Isabel 's shoulder . And then , as if this gesture made her shy , she went on hurriedly , " You 'll have a hard day tomorrow . Dr. Willoughby wants to talk to you about the funeral . But try to sleep tonight , " she added . " Would you like a pill ? " " Thank you , I have some . " " It seems as if we 'd never think this through to the end  --  not for a long time , " Julia added at the door . " But you 've been a great help . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door . Damon had rushed on ahead , as usual . " I have to feel my way.  |p176Isabel  drank two cups of coffee , but found that she could n't eat . Her bed was strewn with newspapers , and she kept picking them up one after another and rereading these words of grief , anger , recrimination , each one of which was a blow , none of which seemed real , seemed to have anything to do with the boy she had remembered so vividly last night , standing at the window of his room , hating himself . The Edward Cavan whose name blazed across the front pages was someone else , someone more important than she could have guessed , someone around whom a whirlpool of conjecture and recrimination now raged . Boxed on the front page of the Times there was a letter , for instance , from a well-known writer to the effect that Cavan was a victim of the cold war , a martyr whose act of despair laid a new burden of responsibility on all men of good will ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer devoted a whole column to a kind of jeering and rejoicing , as if an enemy had fallen , and went so far as to accuse Edward of being a coward . Isabel herself felt nothing now but confusion , shame and , worst of all , exposure . How would she ever dare go out , go down the stairs and meet all the eyes ? Her quiet talk with the Phillipseshad been nothing but a short reprieve , an illusion that kindness would smooth over and make possible these terrible days , and above all that the whole business was a private matter . Now she had to recognize that far more than private feelings clustered round Edward . Already , only forty hours or so after his death , he had ceased to be human , was being made into an effigy , like a stuffed straw man held up before crowds to be cheered or jeered ; he , the person , had already been snatched away and transformedto fit people 's prejudices and passions , a symbol , she supposed intellectual people might call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How would she cope ? How find her way ? How meet it all ? The whole world was her enemy this morning , waiting to pounce and demand of her some answer , some stand . But she had no answer at all , she did not know what she believed about Edward now . Oh , if only Henry were here , she thought  --  and then cringed . Henry would be meeting the world at home , would be reading the same headlines , or others like them . Even he would be dragged down into the whirlpool , he and the children . No one she loved was safe . She lay in bed , the shades pulled down , smoking , wishingshe could lock the door from the inside and just stay here for the next three days , refuse to see anyone , be ill . Instead she must dress , go out into a strange city and take all kinds of responsibilities  --  the funeral ? Her heart beatp178furiously . What happened when people committed suicide ? And all the time she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , not have chosen her for this task . What did family mean to him ? She dressed angrily , efficiently , determined at least that the facade would be impeccable , that she would not again give herself away as she had done last night because , no doubt , she was too tired to be armed . She would do what had to be done , but she would hold herself back , that self that Edward had so completely rejected . She would go home untouched , unchanged . So she said to herself , writing out determination with the red lipstick , drawing the line of her mouth harshly a little redder than usual . The man at the desk told her that the church was just a few minutes away . " Just a nice little walk , " he said genially . The hotel had been like all hotels , but as soon as she stepped out onto the brick pavement , into the bright Octobermorning , the special quality of the place assailed her , and she became a stranger . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long red scarf streaming out behind her and a pile of books in the basket . As Isabel walked on , she became part of a procession of students , boys and girls in small groups , a few isolated ones threading their way through , and all moving towards the spires and towers she could see in the distance . They were wholly self-absorbed so that she moved among them like a ghost , watching her step on the irregular pavement , looking up at the old elms and clown at their roots humping the bricks under her feet , looking at the churches ( there seemed to be a great many ) . She had now reached a long brick wall enclosing a group of rather formidable Georgian buildings , and here , she wasp179glad to see , a good many of the students turned off . That must be Radcliffe , she thought , relieved to be more or less alone now , with a great expanse of park on her left and in the distance a terribly ugly Gothic tower with a black-faced clock on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little faster , for should n't the low gray church she was looking for be just along here ? Yes , there it was , with a funny old cemetery beside it , a little plain building , she thought it at first . The tower was square with a small window in the upper part and a beautiful red door at its base . There was something surprisingabout it , standing here , so sober , with the traffic roaring past , something harmonious and quieting . She walked a little beyond it to look back and see the long windows at the side . She supposed that it was old . For a moment she had forgotten her errand , but now she rememberedand turned back , hurrying a little , not knowing quite where to go . She was standing just in front of the red doors , hesitating , when a voice said behind her , " Were you looking for me ? Are you Mrs. Ferrier ? " " Yes , I am . " " Come into my office , wo n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes behind glasses , the pale bald head , and then she was following Dr. Willoughby into his office . He reminded her of a plump , cheerful bird , a robin perhaps . " Sit down . Do you mind if I light my pipe ? " " Not at all . " She sat , unrelaxed , holding her handbag stiffly in her lap , while he eyed her , she felt , just as a bird might , shyly , glancingly . " You must be very tired , " he said without especialp180emphasis , pulling at his pipe in short puffs to get it going . Then he looked at her again , tilting his head a little to one side . " I 'm not tired , so much as agitated , " she said . " The papers were rather a shock . None of it seems quite real , " she said stiffly . " You must n't pay too much attention to all that , Mrs. Ferrier , " he said quite brusquely . " I ca n't help it . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or  --  I do n't know  --  more important than I knew . It 's all so terribly public , Dr. Willoughby , almost indecent . I thought professors " Edward Cavan was a rather rare and special kind of professor , as I do n't need to tell you . " Isabel felt that he was playing for position , walking round and round the subject , until he could get a foothold , find out where she herself stood . " I had no way of knowing . We have hardly seen each other in recent years . " " Let there be no misunderstanding , Mrs. Ferrier , " he said gravely . " I had the greatest respect for your brother . I honored him . " " Why ? " Isabel asked eagerly , then blushed . " It 's a strange question , I know , but surely he had become so fierce , so difficult . " " Yes , " Dr. Willoughby withdrew and thought this over . Then as if he had made up his mind , he leaned forward , clasping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some hidden pressure was about to be exerted , pushed her chair back a fraction . " In general people of this faith are apt to be conservative , of course . Among the Protestant group we have been the traditionalists . "  | " How then did Edward . . . ? " She left the question in mid-air . " Well , " Dr. Willoughby smiled , " he did n't . He was troubled . He came here more than once to talk with me . But there were reasons why he could feel at home in this church . We have a considerable Negro membership , for instance . Then your brother found comfort in the ritual ; that was the poet in him . There was also very strong in him the practicing Christian , the Christian who wants to follow Christ as literally as possible . I happen to know , for instance , that it troubled him to be responsible for more money than he needed . " " I believe he gave most of it away . " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she felt , and went on , " but it troubled him to be able to do that . He felt it a barrier , and what your brother wanted most , Mrs. Ferrier , was communion . " Dr. Willoughby had raised his voice just a fraction and now looked her straight in the eye ; Isabel met the glance , felt as if she were being hammered at and looked down frowning . " Something of what a theologian means by the communionof saints on earth , " he went on implacably . " That , in the long run , was I am sure at the root of his socialism . It was not a materialistic view at all , and there perhaps was the fatal irony of his position , also the loneliness of it . " Dr. Willoughby picked up his pipe , tapped it out and relit it , perhaps to give her time . All this , Isabel thought , sounded convincing enough . The man was obviously sincere , yet it seemed as remote from the Edward she knew , shouting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bedtime story . " He was dreadfully intolerant , " she said quite harshly.  |p182Dr  . Willoughby gave her a quick appraising look and then , rather unexpectedly , got up . " Come over to my house and have a cup of tea , Mrs. Ferrier . Do you have time ? " " Of course . " She wanted to say , " I 'm helpless . You will all talk to me about Edward ; that 's what I 'm here for . " But she followed him out across the flagstoned court , thinkingthat a cup of tea sounded rather good , amused also by the idea of drinking tea at half-past ten in the morning . Was it a Cambridge custom or only an Episcopalian one ? And then would Dr. Willoughby talk about the funeral ? For that was what was making her withhold herself , a kind of panic . No mention had been made as yet of suicide , of sin . She sat down gratefully in the small library where Dr. Willoughby left her , looked at the books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather armchairs , the quiet coziness of everything , and she sank down into one of these , at last in a relaxed position , one foot under her . Here in the moment of silence , for the first time since she had come to Cambridge she sensed Edward instead of only thinking about him . She could see him here among the books , leaning forward , his hands clasped between his knees , leaning back to laugh his unexpectedly buoyant rather light laugh , the laugh of a boy not a man . She rememberedthose years at Cornell , which he never spoke of without lighting up in the warmth of them , how it seemed he was discovering everything at once , including his own real self , how proud he was of being editor of the literary magazine , how ardently he participated in every side of college life , for at that time he still played tennis , she remembered . " Where did his happiness go , Dr. Willoughby ? " shep183asked , on the stream of these memories , while he passed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Edward and Isabel . He had invited her to come to his graduation . " What happened to him ? I suppose it 's the loss of all that , his enthusiasm , his warmth , the waste that I ca n't accept . " She set her cup down on the table rather hard and repeated , " The awful waste ! " " That 's what we all feel . " Isabel observed him , bright-eyed robin of a man , so round and safe , so unshaken , and in one of those flashes of intuition she saw Edward again , standing with his back to the fireplace in her own house , angry , sore , difficult . Yet she knew now how much she loved him , how much she had longed to reach out and touch him . " He had become untouchable , " she murmured . " Yes , " Dr. Willoughby said gently , " despair separates . It is separation  --  and that , no doubt , is why it is a sin . " This was the word she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shocked her back into the realization of why she was here and she sat up very straight to ask , " What will you do about the service ? I mean , after all , the Burial of the Dead . Can you ? " Her hand was shaking so much she did not dare pick up her cup . Dr. Willoughby got up and walked slowly up and down the small room , his hands behind his back . She was now near to tears and very frightened , so frightened that she hid her face behind her hand , waiting as if for a verdict . " I shall read the service , " Dr. Willoughby said and sat down again . " For as far as I can see he did no evil ; he suffered much ; who are we to judge ? " " Thank you , " Isabel said in a small voice . " That 's what I came to ask . " Relief flooded her . Unashamedly she wipedp184her eyes , blew her nose . The church , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctuary to the self-tortured , even to the criminal , but she took back the word . Dr. Willoughbyhad erased the word by all that he had told her . And for a moment at least she could lay aside the sense she had had of being attacked , of being pursued by she did not know what exactly . She was relieved to be asked to deal now with certain practical questions , such as the casket . It seemed that she must go to an address Dr. Willoughbygave her and decide what would be suitable . He would call a taxi ; it should not take very long . Would she have time before lunch ? She was to lunch with a Professor Goldberg . Dr. Willoughby raised his eyebrows a trifle . " Who is Professor Goldberg ? " she asked . " Tell me a little about these people . I 'm so ignorant "  --  she smiled a social smile . Goldberg , it seemed , was the star of the Englishdepartment , but by no means an intimate friend of Edward 's . Dr. Willoughby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she could not press him for his reasons . She was helpless , at the mercy of strangers . Would Dr. Willoughby tell her something about an Italian professor called Fosca ? She was to meet him that night at the Phillipses for dinner . " Sit down just a minute , " Dr. Willoughby commanded . " Orlando Fosca , " he murmured , tasting the name as if it were an old brandy . " One of the few great men . You 've heard no doubt of his history of comparative literature in the Renaissance ? " She shook her head . " A classic work in the field . He 's a humanist of the old school and I happen to know that your brother was extremely fond of him . " " He sounded so frail , " but what she meant was " sop185old . " " It 's terrible that he had to be called when  --  when it happened . " " Tonight perhaps you will see the fire , and then he will not seem frail , " and Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old school , came here to escape from Mussolini years ago . He belongs to another era , the era of pure idealism before World War One . Becauseof that he has been able to keep a kind of innocence  --  is that the word ?  --  which people of your brother 's generationand mine have lost . He 's an atheist of course . That too is a matter of generation , perhaps . " " You know so much about "  --  she hesitated  --  " about all this . " Again Dr. Willoughby smiled his mischievous smile . " You think of a man of my profession as outside politics , I expect , but that only shows that you too are an innocent . We 're all engaged in politics in one way or another , Mrs. Ferrier . It 's a political age . " " Oh dear , " she sighed , " I suppose it is . I hate it all so . " It was time , she thought , that she went about the business of the casket and she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming to his subject . She half listened , missed the first half of the sentence and heard him say only , " I have a good deal more respect for Orlando Fosca than for some members of my congregation , as a matter of fact . " " Because he 's not afraid ? " she asked quickly , for she felt again the slight pressure behind the words . " Because he lives what he believes . " " I see . " Isabel knew that sooner or later she would be accused , of what she did not know , but of something . Now she began to realize what it would be . In the last hour shep186had seen Edward raised up into a communion from which she and her husband , regular churchgoers , had shut themselves out . " The communion of saints on earth , " she said with a shade of irony . " Are the Phillipses like that too ? " " Oh , Damon Phillips , " Dr. Willoughby said quickly , " is a different kind of man altogether , brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips is a restless man . " It seemed that he might have said something less charitable but checked himself . " A most likable chap , with a wonderfulwife , as perhaps you saw last night . Yes , you really had better be on your way , " he said . " I 'll just call a cab . " Isabel drew on her gloves . She was beginning to see that she had come into a world where people were concerned with things that she and Henry never thought about at all . She had come unarmed into a place where the pressureswere very great and were pressures of a kind that she had never even imagined . How would she ever come through safe , unharmed ? " Do n't let them scare you , Mrs. Ferrier , " Dr. Willoughbysaid unexpectedly as he came back . " I am scared , " she confessed , " very . But I expect I shall learn a great deal . How can I thank you ? " She gave him her gloved hand.  |p187Isabel  , walking with Ivan Goldberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many queer people gathered in one place in her life . If it was not an old lady with ragged gray hair , hatless and carrying a peculiar green bag stuffed with books , it was a cluster of boys of all shapes , sizes , and colors , or a tiny man with a goatee and flowing mustaches who looked as if he had stepped out of a Tchekov play . But they all wore some mark in common , the mark , she supposed , of intellectual people ; they looked as if they needed sleep and fresh air . She was so absorbed in these impressions that she almost forgot the tall stranger at her side , with his air of serene superiority , shepherding her now into a kind of back alley . " I brought you this way because from here one gets a rather charming vignette . Look , just ahead there , that old brick building and the Christ Church Tower behind it.  |p188Quite  eighteenth century , is n't it ? " He gave it to her like a present , rather formally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where I was this morning ? " " Yes . " " I 'm taking you to a French restaurant , " he announced in his precise way . " We can have a glass of wine , and also it 's a bit less exposed than the Faculty Club . I hope you do n't mind . " " Of course not . " Then they said very little until they were settled in a booth in this rather dark restaurant , filled with excitable people around them , all talking at once . Professor Goldberg studied the menu for what seemed a very long time , and while he did so , Isabel studied him . She was trying to decide why one would know he was a professor anywhere  --  in spite of his banker 's gray suit , his immaculate blue shirt and dark blue tie . Was it the small very bright eyes behind rather thick glasses , or the slightly superior way he had of smiling , or his manner which from the beginning had been , it seemed to her , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omelette , a mushroom omelette , and a salad , " he said as if it were a matter of some importance . Then when she had agreed and he had given the order and chosen the wine , there came a pause . They had reached the frontier of small talk and they would have to come to the point . Why in fact had he wished to see her , she wondered ? Curiosity ? Even malice ? He was observing her now and , troubled by the questionin his look , she found herself filling in rather rapidly , setting up a screen of words , as she launched into a description of the casket company where she had just been ,  |p189the  hushed atmosphere , the smoothness with which she had been persuaded into the most expensive possible bronze object , against her better judgment . She told it half humorously but something in his response froze the words on her lips . He was looking out through his face , his mask , she suddenly felt . He was trying to say something . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know quite what to say  --  I feel so inadequate . Something is expected of me . What "  --  she attacked out of sheer panic  --  " for instance do you expect of me ? " Professor Goldberg offered her a cigarette and lit one for himself ; the question lay in the air between them for some seconds . " It 's more , I think , what I expect of myself , Mrs. Ferrier . " " I do n't quite understand . " " I was bold to ask for your time today . I suppose I am not quite myself . None of us is . We are victims of shock . You meet us under strange circumstances , Mrs. Ferrier . " The speech was labored , so much so , that  --  did she dream it ?  --  it was as if he were making a physical effort and his breath came hard . " But at least , " she said quietly , " you knew Edward . I did n't . When I read the papers this morning , I She saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table twice . His face flushed over . " It 's disgraceful . A travesty , " he said between his teeth . " It will have to stop . " " How can it stop ? " Just then the waitress appeared with a bottle wrapped in a napkin and poured out two glasses of wine . However angry he may have been , Ivan Goldberg tasted it very gravely , pronounced it adequate and then leaned forward ,  |p190glaring  at her as if she were not there , to say , " It 's like a terrible machine that has been set in motion  --  passion , doubt , guilt . We 're all caught in the machine , " he said , almost as if he accused her . " No one has told me why he did it , " Isabel said , as if to deflect the pressure a fraction . " He did n't know himself , " Ivan 's answer came quickly . It was as if he were holding back torrents of words . Would they spill out ? Would she have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously . She wondered if people could hear what they were saying , wondered whether other people were talking about the same thing . For a second it seemed to her that the room was full of conspirators , heads bent together , avid eager faces , those across the way for instance . " People who commit suicide do not do it for a reason  --  they may think so , rationalize . Your brother talked about the political tensions " Yes , " Isabel said sharply . " I know . " " That was n't it , " Goldberg said almost savagely . " How do you know ? " For suddenly she resented him , resented his swallowing her up in his own conflicts whatever they were , resented his asking her to lunch for some purpose of his own . " Forgive me , I "  --  he smoked at his cigarette furiously  --  " you shared your brother 's political beliefs ? " Isabel caught her breath . It was a direct attack and she was not prepared . " No , " she murmured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He seemed crazy to me . " She went the whole way . Why not ? He might as well know the worst . She was amazed to see that he was relieved . The little smile played around his lips again . He attacked his omelettep191with relish . What have I done , she thought ? I 've given him something I did n't mean to give . We are conspirators then , conspirators against Edward , against what Edward meant . He wants me for an ally . " No he was n't crazy "  --  Goldb erg looked up with almost a smile  --  " and he 's put us both in the wrong . You know that of course , " he said as if he were daring her to deny it , as if he enjoyed it , too . His eyes gleamed behind his glasses . " Why did you ask me to lunch , Professor Goldberg ? " She asked with a trace of reserve . " What do you want of me ? I 've felt ever since I got here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , treated gently . It 's not my world , " she said . " I do n't belong here . I 'm a stranger . " " And afraid , in a world you never made ? " It sounded like a quotation , but she did not recognize it . " Edward was way beyond me even when I was a child , " she added . And then , was it the wine ? the food ? On a wave of self-assertion she went on to tell him the truth , tell this smug professor the truth . " I feel ashamed . I resent what Edward did , " she said , " if you must know . And I do n't feel guilty , " she ended . " Neither do I , " Goldberg said blandly . Would she let it pass ? After all , they could part now ; they would never see each other again . She did not have to push the thing further into places where she would not be able to cope . She saw his left hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't play safe , " she heard herselfsaying , " and most of us do . I bet you do feel guilty , " she ended , looking at him speculatively . " Yes , " she added , as Goldberg lowered his eyes , " you do . Why ? " " I shall succeed where he failed . But my success wo n't mean anything , you see . The one person who really cared ,  |p192who  would have known what my book meant , wo n't be there to read it . And why ? " His voice thickened . Isabel knew there was real feeling here , and she respected it . She did not look at him . " Because he knew and the reason he knew was that he was what he was . Quite a few pilots got killed trying to break the sound barrier , you know  --  and you might call it suicide , in a way . The first tries were suicidal , actually . Edward was trying to break through a much more difficult barrier , a human barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whole . The poor guy , " Goldbergsaid , and now the torrent of words had come . " He was so innocent that he was terribly impressed because Wallace read his books . This seemed to him a sign , a portent  --  itwas the breaking through toward him from the other side . I see it all so clearly now , " and his voice grew hard . " But he could n't break through of course . " " Why do you care then ? " Isabel asked . It was amazing how , when they talked of Edward , all these people lit up . " I do n't know . The strange thing is "  --  Goldberg looked at her now , really as if she were a human being  --  " that one can talk to you . And one could n't talk to Edward " Because I do n't make you feel guilty "  --  she smiled an ironic smile  --  " I 'm nobody 's conscience , and Edward , it seems to me , was . " " I hated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . I never gave in for a moment , " Goldberg said half to himself . " Only last week he came and begged me to sign a petition  --  and I refused . " " And now , " she asked quickly , " will you sign it ? " Thequestion , she saw as soon as it had slipped out , was crucial , was also perhaps cruel . " I 'm sorry . That 's not fair , is it ? " " No , " Goldberg pushed his plate away . " I sha n't signp193it . " There was a pause while he ordered coffee and dessert , then he came back to the point . " People do n't change , Mrs. Ferrier , even under shock . That 's where your brother was beating his head against a wall . He believed that he might change , you see , that he would learn to break through . But he could n't , any more than I can . The only difference is that I accept certain facts and he could n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my passion , Mrs. Ferrier  --  I am respected and feared , but I am not loved . That is a fact I have had to accept . " It was a confession she chose to lay aside , because she had to get back to something he had said earlier . " But if Edward believed in the possibilities of change , then why did he . . . ? " " Something snapped , I suppose . No one can stand too much tension . " " Something snapped  --  as simple as that , " she looked suddenly angry . " But it 's eating you all up , just the same . And eating me up , too . " " Because , do n't you see , it throws a bright hard light  --  and so is symptomatic  --  on all our inward divisions . It is an attack . " " I did n't know I was divided , " Isabel said quickly . " I 'm not . " " Because , I suspect , you have like me deliberately chosen to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you say , It 's none of my business ? My business is my husband , my children  --  do you have children ? " he interrupted himself to ask . " Yes , two , one in high school , a boy . One girl thirteen years old . " " And I say that literature is my business . "  | " And we 're both wrong ? " she asked . Goldberg pushed the cigarette out hard in the ash tray . " Not wrong , less than we might be , less than Edward was . But we 'll live , Mrs. Ferrier , wo n't we ? " He smiled his intolerable smile . " Yes , no doubt we will . " I 've got to get away from here , she thought . This man is a devil . He 's too brilliant and too unhappy and he wants to hurt me now , and he has hurt me . She looked at her watch , shutting out the thoughts that raced through her mind , with this deliberate gesture . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you ? I 'm sorry I have detained you so long . " His face froze . He tapped on a glass with his spoon and looked around for the waitress , then turned to her with a surprisingly human smile , a real one and said , " Do you have half an hour to spare ? It seems too bad that you have n't seen anything of the college . After all , this was Edward 's life , all this . I 'd like to show you a few things ... " Isabel hesitated a fraction of a second , saw his face close again , his guard go up , and knew that she must do it , however much she would have liked to go back to her lair , pull the shades down , lie in the dark and smoke and think , perhaps call Henry at the hospital and hear his sane normal voice . " That 's awfully kind of you , " she said , allowing the thought of Henry to fade . " No one could be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yard through the high ironwork gates that they were entering a secret world . For one thing there was no traffic here , except human beings on their feet . As they crossed the Square on thep195way she had been utterly bewildered by the cars , the peoplemoving between the cars , the hectic air it all had . Here inside the Yard , it was as if a quiet hand were laid upon them . Gardeners were busy raking leaves off the grass . Students sat under the trees and on the steps of the library in little knots or alone . Goldberg stopped for a moment at the seated statue of John Harvard , then again to point out the sharp clean thrust of the chapel spire . As he talked about these things , he became a different person ; he seemed ten years younger . And the tension of their talk in the dark restaurant had in some way relaxed ; for the first time since she had arrived the night before , Isabel felt she could breathe freely . But it was only when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that dustlessatmosphere , so silent it seemed almost deathly , over glass-topped tables under which Keats 's own handwriting lay , that she turned to her companion confidently and felt able to ask the real question . " But what good is it , " she asked as if she had picked up a remark of his where it lay between them , " to be involved in what you call the agony of the times , as Edward was , if you come to the wrong conclusions ? How can you be wrong and right at the same time ? You say that you can not agree with his political point of view and you say at the same time that you and I are less than he was " Do n't lean too hard on that glass . It might break , " he said in a whisper . " Come out , " he said , " let 's sit on the steps of the library and smoke a cigarette . " For Ivan Goldbergthis was a most extraordinary concession , but Isabel did not know that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in awe of the environment . The stepsp196sounded less formidable than the hushed embalmed room . People would not stare at her as if she were a queer animal strayed into the academic grove . Climbing the shallow steps , to a place where they could lean against the wall and be in the sun , Isabel wonderedwhy she had thought of Professor Goldberg as a devil . He offered her a cigarette , lit it , and looked up , blinking myopically at the chapel spire just across from them . It soared above the Yard and the trees and all the people like some continual signal , she thought . " I 've never done this before , " he announced as if it were a confession . " I 've never quite dared . " " It takes a stranger to make you dare ? " " It takes Edward 's sister , " he said gravely . He took off his glasses , rubbed them , and put them back on . " You talked about accepting the facts  --  what then were the facts Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really want to understand . " It occurred to her that only because Edward was dead was it possible for her to sit here in the very heart of his world and ask such a question . Had he been alive , his physical presence would have blocked the way  --  and besides never never would he have sat like this with her , open to question . She shivered . " Are you cold ? " Ivan Goldberg asked . " Here , sit on my coat . " " No , I 'm not cold . Only every now and then it 's as if  --  Edward  --  " she found she could n't go on . " I know , " Goldberg said gently . " We talk and talk and the words mean nothing . " " Still , " and Isabel turned to him with a smile , " if you can answer , please do . " Then she looked down at her hands thoughtfully . " You see , in a queer way it 's as if Edwardp197had died for me a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more alive . " " Yes , that 's it , " Goldberg said quickly , " he 's terribly alive now  --  I wonder how long he will be . " He looked off across the Yard and smoked a moment , then said what he had obviously been turning over in his mind . " There were two things Edward could n't accept . For one , that his idea of socialism was old-fashioned . Socialism as we are seeing it in action in England , for instance , is growing to be antiindividualistic , bureaucratic , and exalts the state at the expense of all Edward meant . A general leveling down does not seem to mean greater opportunity for all , in fact quite the contrary . It 's as rigid as the statism Edward so feared and hated in Nazi Germany , and as formalistic , though of course not wicked . And that is why , I suppose , the Czechoslovakiancoup was possible at all . But Edward simply could n't admit this . What he saw when he was over there was the fervor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings whom he loved and in whom he believed . " That was one thing ; the other was his sentimentality about the working man and about the unions , and his refusal to admit that in American democracy as it is , the intellectual is isolated , suspected and never an organic part of political life , at best an amateur , at worst a dupe as Wallace proved to be . " " You make it sound so clear , " and Isabel sighed . " Why if it 's so clear was Edward important ? Why do people mind so much ? Why do they feel attacked ? " " Because of the reasons for what he believed . The reasons , you see , were generous , deeply human reasons , even if the conclusions as far as we can see , were unworthy.  |p198Who  are we , unwilling or unable to commit ourselves , to judge ? " " Must one be committed ' as you call it ? Why ca n't people go about their business in peace ? " she asked passionately . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel felt as if she were being sucked down into a whirlpool where nothing was clear , where everything was struggle and agony . " There is a price to be paid for not participating and for refusing to be responsible . I wonder , " Goldberg said , and she felt the slight barb in the question , " what price you have paid . " " For staying safely outside ? " " For staying safely outside . " Isabel thought this over for a moment . " That 's what you meant then when you said something about what you might expect of yourself , because of Edward  --  since  --  " " Yes , " Goldberg said , stamping out his cigarette with his feet . The sun which had warmed them had gone behind a cloud and Isabel felt the chill from the stone steps in her bones . It was time to go . She did not quite understand why Goldberg thanked her so warmly when they parted at the door of the hotel , but perhaps it was that he would not have talked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he too was lonely . She smiled as she lay on her bed and remembered that she had imagined these people as safe , as superior , as part of some whole from which she was shut out , whereas she saw now they were terribly divided and exposed , exposed to each other , as naked in some ways as children . Oh , if she could only talk to Edward now . She moved her head back and forth on the pillow as if to keep the tears back by this physical motion.  | " We 'll have a fire , " Damon said after dinner , as they went back into the drawing room . " I 'll just light it for you , " he said as Julia brought in coffee . Isabel , noting the three cups on the tray , realized with amusement that here in Cambridgethe gentlemen would stay on in the dining room for their brandy while the ladies retired . She had felt all eveninglike a total stranger in a noisy and passionate world . Especially Grace Kimlock  --  was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramrod on the little sofa by the fire , terrified her . She indeed had the hawk 's eyes which Isabel had imagined . In this pause while Julia carried out the cocktail glasses , while Damon lit the Cape Cod lighter and set it under the logs , she felt those eyes upon her . To escape she got up and wandered over to look at a portrait of Damon as a boy hanging over the model of a clipper ship in a glass case which needed dusting . Damon was dressedp200in a white sailor suit with a whistle round his shoulder on a blue cord , and he was looking straight out , a thin fairhairedboy with very bright eyes . The portrait shone out in the great shabby room as the one thing young and untouched by time , for the dark red curtains at the windows had faded and looked dusty too , and the Persian carpet had taken on a soft pinkish glow . Yet how comfortable the Victorianchairs were , she thought , and how safe one felt here . It had been like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Damon 's father 's house before it became his , she had been told . This , in itself , this continuity in one house so unusual in America , filled her with peace . When Grace Kimlock spoke , Isabel had forgotten her . " I wonder how they ever got Damon to sit still long enough for that portrait , " the clear sharp voice broke in . And then , as Isabel turned to answer , she pounced . " You 're not a bit like Edward , " she said , challenging , " are you ? " Isabel was saved by Julia who came back , providentially , just then . Isabel admired Julia ; she moved among them , these passionate , voluble people so calmly and slowly , with such control . And now she turned to Grace and said severely , " Grace , be good . Do you take cream and sugar ? " " Black , please . And why should I be good ? We have very little time and being good , ' which I take it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " " Families are such queer things , " Isabel said , half in answer , but she was also still under the spell of the room , its peace . " What was it like in yours ? " Grace Kimlock asked . " Edward used to talk about your mother . She must havep201been an extraordinary woman , really  --  she painted , wrote poetry or something , did n't she ?  --  gardened . . . " She looked at Isabel expectantly over the rim of her coffee cup . But Isabel was thinking , That is what a life adds up to , the things one does . Her mother , defined like this , had no reality , loomed up out of focus . Flow to say it right ? " Somehow she was full of life , it was that . Wonderfullyresponsive to everything  --  a child 's game , the light on leaves  --  she was always there so completely "  --  Isabel faltered , turned to Julia  --  " how little the words mean . " " She should n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to Edward . " She seemed unconscious of the impliedrebuke , but Isabel colored . " She did n't want to die , " she said quickly . The fact that Edward had wanted to die rushed into the silence as the three women sat and looked at the fire . After a pause , Isabel went on , " It was Edward 's year at Oxford . She would n't let me tell him , and she only lived as long as she did because she meant to , willed it , kept her heart beating somehow for his sake . The last thing she said was lovely ' about a little green orchid someone had sent . That , " Isabel added , " was very like her . " She was suddenly grateful to these two strangers , to these two friends of Edward 's for making it possible for her to talk . " You 're quite right , Miss Kimlock , " she said quite seriously , " you 've startled me into telling things I have n't ever spoken aloud . " Grace flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in her own thoughts , was looking at the fire . Was it the orchid ? Something led her to say , " It 's strange but these last years I 've almost forgotten that side of Edward , the passionate love of beauty . " Stretching her hands to the fire as if from some hunger , she said , " But of course it was al/ways there . Did you ever go to a museum with him , Grace ? " " No , " Grace answered shortly . She could n't really bear what anyone else knew of Edward . " I ( lid , that summer in France . We ran into him quite by chance at Albi and saw the Toulouse-Lautrecs together . I 'll never forget the way Edward lit up then , how he could make one see . I expect he got that from your mother . " She turned to Isabel , drawing her in again . " And what did he get from your father ? " Grace Kimlockleaned forward to ask for another cup of coffee . Isabel froze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her mind raced ahead while she said , " They did n't get on , never did . Maybe they were too much alike . " " Edward never talked about his father . " " He hated Father . He wanted to break away from all that . " Isabel felt cornered . Was there no way out ? Must she face this tearing in the family again , bring it out to be searched by those hawk 's eyes ? Her hand was trembling . " All what ? " " Father was a banker , a Republican of course , and very sure that he was right about everything . He had no patience with failure of any kind . If people were out of work , it was their fault , and so on . He and Edward hit each other head on about everything , as you can see , " and she smiled . It was getting less hard as she talked . She almost wanted to tell them now . " But that was n't it  --  not really  --  it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would n't , made up his mind not to . Just like Edward . They walled themselves in against each other . It got so I dreaded every meal because of the arguments . But there was something powerful about Father , very powerful . Hep203had a brilliant hard mind . . . " She faltered and turned now rather shyly to Grace , " I guess that 's the real answer to your question . " " He does sound rather difficult , " Grace said with a slightly malicious smile . " I expect he does to you . But surely "  --  Isabel felt she must fight their sense of isolated superiority , this little selfenclosedworld which took so much for granted  --  " there is n't only one way of looking at things ? Surely it 's possible honestly to disagree and still to respect people , even Republicans , " she added . She turned helplessly to Julia . " Oh , we 're all full of poison , " Julia answered gently . " You 're so sure you 're right . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she hesitated , looking for a word . " Ivory tower ? But did n't your father live in an ivory tower ? " Grace laughed a short laugh . " It 's rather droll that we should be accused of that . Most people accused Edward of meddling too much in the world , of refusing to stay safely in the ivory tower . " " I do n't know , " Isabel retreated . She felt again the dry wind of passion assailing her . " I live in such a different world . " She thought of Henry , her husband , playing bridge now with the Eriksons across the street , relaxing slowly after his high-pressure day at the hospital , thought of him with nostalgia , the safety , the coziness of their lives where these winds did not blow . " But you have to take sides , " Grace said relentlessly , sitting up a little straighter , " in any world . You have to make up your mind , go the way things are going or fight the way things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way things are going for quite some time , " Isabel said quietly.  | " Do n't think we 're sure we 're right , " Julia broke in . " Damon told you , " she went on with a visible effort , " that Edward had shut the door on us , walked out of this house two nights before  --  " Julia 's face looked absolutely drained . This then was the explanation of the undercurrents of violentemotion Isabel had sensed at the dinner table . " I 'm sorry . " She felt ashamed now . She should have learned from Dr. Willoughby , from Professor Goldberg that it was all far more complicated and human than it seemed under the surface of this safe Victorian room . Henry would lump all these people together as a bunch of radicals , but it was not as black and white as it looked . Was anything when you came close enough to see ? " I wish you 'd tell me about it , if you feel you could . " The question was addressed to Julia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then decide to take the plunge . She explained briefly what had happened at the Civil Liberties Union . She was interrupted by Grace who hammeredout that to Edward the point in question was not unimportant . But for once Julia was determined and brushed Grace aside firmly . " Isabel does n't want to hear all the details and ramifications . After all we 've lived all this out for years , she has n't . " Grace answered , " Well , it 's time she learned . She 's an American citizen , is n't she ? " Isabel blushed , but Julia pointedly ignored the sally . " Ever since it happened , ever since Edward walked out of the house I 've been trying to understand the essence  --  maybe I can try to say it now . You see , we all felt when Wallace led the Progressive Party that here was a chance to start with a clean slate , to have a truly liberal party without commitments to party bosses , to a reactionary South and so on . It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in by the extreme Left and that this might be as dangerous as commitments which the Democratic Party has to the extreme Right in the shape of Southern Democrats . " Isabel listened like a child at school , but none of it hit home for her . She was painfully aware that what made Grace visibly bristle and Julia obviously suffer meant little or nothing to her . " Some people are not afraid of the extreme Left , " Grace said flatly . " Right . Edward and Grace stuck by Wallace , and this was the beginning of our fight with Edward . IIe never forgaveDamon , quite , for withdrawing from the Progressive Party before the election . These are the facts , you see , but they are not the essence . " " And what is the essence , Julia ? " Grace Kimlock inquired . " You wo n't like this , Grace , " Julia half-smiled . " I do n't expect to . I do n't like any of it . " " I can only say what I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  --  that word which you so despise , Grace . It seems to me that the true liberal is capable of change , is not rigid , grows in fact . What you see as compromise , I see as recognition . Since the last war , there has been a rather subtle shift toward what I might call enlightened conservatism . " " Compromise  --  fatal compromise and cowardice , " Grace answered quickly . " That is how Edward saw it , of course . For so many years the extreme Right  --  in Spain , in Italy , in Germany  --  has been the enemy . Now we are facing an enemy from the Left . You see , Isabel , all our loyalties and faith have been bound up with the Left . This shift makes deep psycholog/ical wounds  --  we have to admit things that we do not want to admit . We have to draw up new frontiers . This is what is happening now and it is not done without pain . " " I call it ratting , " Grace Kimlock sat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For some of us , " Julia went on imperturbably , " the failure of the Czechoslovakian Socialists to hold out against communism was the final illuminating thing . " " Edward felt strongly about that , did n't he ? " Isabel at least could fasten onto this fact in the midst of a great deal that was simply bewildering . It was all so queerly religious and intense , that was what bothered her . At home people just voted whatever party they were for and then that was that . You did n't lie awake at night , fighting with your conscience . " After all , he had been in Prague for a year . Presumablyhe knew something about it , " Grace said . Mercifully perhaps , they heard Fosca 's voice in the hall , as Damon and he came back to join the ladies . " It 's not going to be easy , in any case , you may be sure of that . " But Damon had already rushed on past him mentally into the next room . " No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you look very cozy in here , I must say . Orlando and I nearly froze to death in there . It 's high time we got the furnace going , Julia . Nice fire , " he said , standing before it , rubbing his hands . Professor Fosca sat down on the sofa beside Grace , his eyes very bright . Isabel looked speculatively at these friends of Edward 's , two men so different yet in one way also alike . ProfessorFosca radiated warmth , but Damon Phillips , for all his charm , was too restless to give one any sense of real communication . He moved so fast that he had hardly letp207her finish a sentence at dinner , and even when he became as old as Professor Fosca , he would never be like him , she felt . Yet they were alike in that their faces were both lined , faces on which thought had left visible traces . It was that , she decided , comparing them with her husband 's clear-cut bronze smoothness . They lived hard ( she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf and tennis to keep his waistline down . They would not grow old gracefully . They would not , she thought , smiling to herself , perhaps grow old at all . She caught Professor Fosca 's clear blue eyes watching her . " An indiscreet question , Mrs. Ferrier , but what made you smile such a perspicacious smile just then , you who come to us from the golden untroubled shores ? " " I was thinking an indiscreet thought . " " I guessed as much . " " She thinks we 're old fools , " Grace Kimlock said with a sniff . " And you do n't think so ? " Orlando teased his old friend . " No , " Isabel spoke directly to Grace , " as a matter of fact , Miss Kimlock , I was thinking that none of you would ever grow old . " " I 'm prepared to agree with you , " Damon said gaily , " but why not ? " But this she could not answer . She could not say  --  Miss Kimlock might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Isabel was afraid . They were too close to tragedy . They had been walking round it all evening , and , she guessed , they had deliberately spared her . They had not insisted  --  except among themselves in that violent argument at the dinner table about socialismp208in Britain , about the Webbs . " I 'm not going to answer that , " she said quietly . " We have so little time . Perhaps I 'll never see you again , " she said , looking at them now one by one , Fosca hunched over on the sofa , his delicate thin hands clasping his knees ; Grace Kimlock , upright , at bay ; Damon Phillips leaning on the back of his wife 's chair and Julia herself plucking a thread from her dress in an absentmindedway . " I must thank you , " she said , and it was like a farewell , " for all you were to Edward , all of you . " " We did n't keep him from being desperately lonely , " Grace Kimlock said sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated with a tremor in her voice . " No , " Isabel held her hands tightly together , " I guess no one could do that . " Because , she would have liked to say , you shut out understanding by the passion of your convictions . You meet opposition to your ideas with something like hysteria always just under the surface . At the very instantof communication you slam the door shut . " Why ? Why does it have to be so painful ? Why are we so divided ? " The words rose to her lips with compelling force ; they were spoken to Fosca . " If Edward could have once talked to me about the things close to his heart without that fearful drivinganger , without shutting me out  --  why am I talking like this ? " She looked about her in a panic . She felt as if a high wall had just fallen down , the wall that had protected her , and now she was naked . She had given herself away . " I must go , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was beginning to feel the tensions which Edward had felt so terribly , in herself , and she knew that she was very tired , tired and with no peace to rest in , no final resolution of anything , only the everlasting questions which devoured the faces around her , as well as her own.  |p209They  were all standing now . They were closing in on her , the enemy , the intellectuals , Edward 's friends . " I must go , " she said again . Then she felt the gentle pressure of an arm around her shoulders , a most extraordinary sensation as if some strong fraternal emotion actually penetrated through her dress , through her skin , through her veins and reached her heart , as if the old man standing beside her could transfuse love like blood itself . " No , dear Isabel , " he said very gently , " you must stay a few moments . You ca n't leave now . " Very gently he drew her over to the sofa and sat down beside her . Julia sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He shut us all out , Isabel , " she said after a moment . " Oh , he was just a living wound at the end . If you 'd seen him as I did " But surely there 's something "  --  Isabel searched for a way to say it  --  " unnatural in that . I mean , he was a sick man surely . " " We 're all sick , " Damon broke in almost angrily . " Edwardwatched his friends making what seemed to him fatal compromises  --  fear creeping in , confusion at the center , the best energies dispersed from within by doubt and anxiety . It 's hard to go back on things you 've believed and fought for all your life . Edward could n't . Are we right ? Was he wrong ? We live in the dark , Mrs. Ferrier , at best . " " You liberals may . Edward did n't , " Grace said acidly . " We are talking to Isabel now , " Orlando Fosca said firmly . " Edward lived close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was his greatness . But he could n't communicatethe very essence of his belief and that was his tragedy . When he fought you , he was fighting him-self. "  | " But you 're not like that , " Isabel said gratefully . " You feel these things just as passionately , but " " I 'm very old . " Orlando smiled his seraphic smile . " I do not expect miracles . And then , " he said more thoughtfully , " I am not an American , except by adoption , and late in my life . Perhaps I feel the pressures less , I do n't know , " and he sighed . " Tell me about Edward , " Isabel said out of all that had happened in the last few minutes . " I need to know . " " I do not think we shall understand the entire meaning of his suicide for some years to come . Let us leave it , then . What you must know is that as a scholar your brother was unmatched for fervor , understanding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The loss to American letters is immeasurable . " The delicate hands were clasped into fists now and the mild blue eyes blazed . The frail old man at her side had become a giant , and Isabel rememberedwhat Dr. Willoughby had said about the fire . " Yes , I think "  --  she stammered slightly  --  " I d-did know that . " " Everyone knows that . What people do not know is what his influence was here , how he challenged the better students , and that he did challenge them as he did because he was involved actively and bitterly in the life outside the college . That is the heart of the matter , " he ended gravely , you see . " I do n't see , " she said , able to be perfectly honest at last , " but maybe someday I will . I mean that you can be so wrong and so right at the same time , that you can shut out love and yet know so much about it , be so lonely and long so for communion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning  --  strange , " she murmured as if to herself . They had come to the end of the line . The silence , in which they all looked at the fire , grew long but no one noticedit . Grace Kimlock gave a loud unconscious sigh . " We 're a long way from that , " she said bitterly . " I wonder , " Orlando answered very gently . " It seems to me we have had this evening an intimation of it . "  |p212It  was a cold gray day , leaves and dust skirling about in a dirty wind , bits of old newspaper flapping against the fence . The few leaves still on the trees looked tired , and Grace Kimlock as she walked down Brattle Street thought all this appropriate , a restless disintegration , Cambridge itself where the green lawns were slowly being eaten up by apartment houses and the old frame houses needed paint , having lost all dignity and charm . Not thinking of Edward to whose funeral she was going , she thought of these things , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an ample thoroughfare , stately and peaceful . It 's all gone or going , she thought , and we are old and tired . She stubbed her toe quite painfully on a brick that the root of a tree had lifted slightly , and stopped for a moment to catch her breath , for she had been walking fast . Just then the bell of Christ Church began top213toll , each long low ring reaching out like the ripples in a pond when a pebble falls , reaching out into the cold air , into the wind with imperative and calming solemnity . And Grace Kimlock walked against it , walked fast against it as if to shut it out , for now she was afraid , she was lonely , she felt bitterly that Orlando Fosca was not there to support her , though he had explained that the ushers must be there much earlier , and he must be sure that Warlock , the distinguishedpoet , was properly met , as well as two Columbia professors . She disliked the idea of the funeral ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , for one thing . As a Unitarian , the child and grandchild of Unitarians , she would be uncomfortable in the atmosphere of Edward 's church . " Mumbo jumbo "  --  she sniffed  --  " buffoonery , " she muttered to herself , as she turned up past Radcliffe College , now quickening her pace , a wave of suddenexcitement shooting through her . This excitement which she could not control , which made her feel slightly trembly all over , was disturbing . She reminded herself that a funeral is not a play . She felt absolutely no emotion , no grief , only this wild excitement as if something were about to happen . For three days they had been waiting for this hour , suspended in the unfamiliar corrupting , disturbing element of Edward 's deed  --  was it that ? That there would be some definite end at last , some finality ? As she drew near the church , she saw that several taxis were stopping , as well as two long black limousines ; already a steady flow of people , nearly half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , under the spell of the tolling bell , automatically slowed down as they turned into the path . A very old lady was being helped out of her car by a chauffeur . Grace felt herself an absolute outsider , as if shep214were about to walk into a drawing room , unintroduced . Just then Mrs. Ilumphreys came and pressed her hand silently , then moved away . The hush from the church reached out and changed them , laid upon them a mask of false solemnity , she thought . And she hated it all , deciding there and then to add a codicil to her will : No funeral , ashes to be thrown to the wind . The strength of this decision took her in through the wide-open red doors , to the hushing carpet , to the grave ushers and  --  thank God  --  Fosca , who came forward from the group of five or six distinguished men , all known to her ( and she was glad to see that Professor Goldberg was one of them ) . Whatever the newspapers might say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart , hungry for praise of Edward . Harvard at least would show its pride , was not ashamed to do so , and Grace Kimlock walked down the aisle , her head high . She slipped into a pew near the middle of the church , irritated by the soft music oozing from the organ . They might at least have played some Mozart , she thought . Mrs. Brimmer knelt down beside her and began to pray . Grace Kimlock on the other hand sat up straight and looked around her with unashamed curiosity . She had to admit that the church looked beautiful . There were great bunches of autumn flowers on the sills of each of the long oval windows and at the altar nothing but white chrysanthemums . She put on her glasses  --  who was that rather frail young man Fosca was leading down to the front rows , while Goldberg preceded one of the deans ? ( The church was nearly full now and there were still fifteen minutes . ) Warlock , she thought with satisfaction . That , she knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wayp215from New York to pay his respects . As well he might , for she knew how patiently Edward had gone over his last book with him , and how carefully later on he had reviewed it for The New Republic  --  how anxious to be just and helpful . Just then , she saw the coffin . Somehow she had avoided seeing it before , though it stood far forward before the altar on a high stand , a tall candle at each corner , covered in black . Grace stared at it now , fascinated , tugging at her brooch as she did when she was nervous . But it had no reality  --  ablack box surrounded by candles . It did not mean " Edward . " It just meant death , and she did not have any idea what death meant . At the moment it seemed to mean Mrs. Brimmer constantlyturning round and craning her neck , to catch her husband 's eye if and when he should come . It meant ProfessorGoldberg , immaculate and stiff , for once not smiling , wearing his Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavingso much like an undertaker that Grace caught herselfsmiling . It meant the rows and rows of students , girls without hats who had tied scarves over their heads , earnest embarrassed young men , and over all , oozing like honey , the pale sentimental organ music . But as she watched , takingit all in like a person at a play , Grace felt falling away from her , little by little , the self-consciousness and the excitement and finally bowed her head as if to shut out all this , as if to find some still point on which she might rest , from which she might go out towards Edward , in which the occasion might at last take on its reality , and she feel a part of it and not the lonely , egocentric , arrogant observer she had been until now . It seemed , in the hush as the bell stopped tolling , andp216for a moment even the organ was silent , as if they were all suspend( 'd in a vacuum , completely separate . Then as more definite music made itself heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fosca alone escorted Isabel Ferrierto her pew . Faces lifted to see her go past , not knowing perhaps who she was , though " family " seemed implicit in her solemn formally-set-apart arrival , in the black veil which hid her face . " Who 's that ? " the incorrigible Mrs. Brimmer whispered in Grace 's ear . " His sister , " she whispered back . But Grace thought , as the lonely figure knelt to pray , not of Isabel , but of their mother , so cruelly absent now and always for so many years , she who held Edward 's love locked up in her helpless heart , helplessly . " I am the resurrection and the life , saith the Lord  --  " The words broke the absolute silence with the force of a trumpet , though they were spoken in a very quiet voice . It seemed to Grace as if in that sudden moment something burst apart inside her . The tears she had not shed until now , had not expected to shed , broke from deep down inside her and flooded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handkerchief , hardly hearing what came next . " We brought nothing into this world , and it is certain we can carry nothing out . " One part of her was aware how cleverly Dr. Willoughby was cutting the burial service so that any reference to " the appointed time " was eliminated . But anotherpart of her knew only the pain and the blessing of the opening words , the longing to believe them true , the strange consolation of them , though she could not affirm their truth , and then she knew , with the force of an actual wound , her own intolerable loneliness . She was ashamedp217of the sobs she held back by sheer force of will , the terror that one would resound in the church like some animal cry , as she felt Mrs. Brimmer stirring uneasily beside her and looked in vain ( she could not see at all ) for at least Fosca 's head somewhere , some point d'appui . For many people in the church that day , there was no way to communicate . There was only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pew , the only Jew among them , held himself forcibly apart . " So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . 0 death , where is thy sting ? 0 grave , where is thy victory ? The sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is the Law . But thanks be to God , which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ  --  " Goldberg never entered a Christian church without feeling himself drawn down into a whirlpool of anguish of different kinds . For him the word " Jesus Christ " was a terribleword . He could not hear it without remembering centuries of pogroms , his father 's stories of their grandfather'svillage in Russia and the terrors of Easter when the Christians went forth to kill any Jews not locked up in their houses , the doors double barred and their hearts like animalhearts feeling only the fear of the hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish among the goyim , for the sake of Edward Cavan . Many times an unbeliever , since he did not even believe ( as the old Italian printer did , whom he had taken down to the front rows ) that Edward was a fighter in the true cause of socialism . Nothing here today , except the presence of the two Columbia professors and Warlock , the poet , spoke to him of his own loss . He wasp218terribly a stranger , forced into ridiculous clothes to parade his grief among strangers . And his teeth were clenched with the effort not to put on his one defense , that smile of superiority and contempt . " Death is a dirty trick , " George Hastings was thinking . IIe had hoped for some ultimate saving word that would frame all he had fumbled to say himself . But the long familiarpassages from the Bible left him cold . Also he was too self-conscious to feel anything , being , as he was , one of four students chosen to carry the coffin out at the appointed time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his " belonging , " he now regretted the honor which lay upon him and kept him from paying attention , for he kept imagining catastrophe  --  that he would stumble at the crucialmoment and the coffin lurch horribly to the floor . Responsibilitykept him apart . It had seemed to Julia , sitting two rows behind Grace Kimlock , that something must happen during the long service to take away the sense of futility  --  for all his anguish , for all his last desperate gesture to communicate something  --  what ?  --  Edward Cavan now in the last few moments had in some terrible way ceased to exist . She had been a little disturbed by Angela Goldberg 's sitting down beside her . No doubt , Julia thought , she felt lonely in this church and had sought Julia out as someone she knew . Yet it had seemed an intrusion ; the consciousness of the silent , slightly resisting presence at her side kept Julia from losing herself , from identifying herself somewhere , somehow , with something , and no longer to be dangling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought up in this church and did not come back without a pang , without an examination of conscience , since , for some years , she had ceased to prac/tice her religion . The sound of the words was soothing , but they had no meaning . They did not console really or explain the presence here of them all , the presence of Edward Cavan dead by his own will . It seemed to her even that they evaded , that they smoothed over with their golden beauty what had to remain naked and terrible to be realized . She felt that they were all being swaddled up in the hush , among the flowers , in the music of the organ , in the ritualistic solemnity from something which must break through and pierce them alive again . And strangely she began almost in spite of herself , to pray , as if the vertical appeal of prayer might somehow make it possible for the horizontal communion , which she craved , to take place at last . It was a felt prayer , hardly articulated in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became key words . " If you could help us to understand and to forgive each other , " she said silently , thinking of Damon , far away now among the ushers , Damon who had no idea how much of the time she resented , almost hated him . " Oh keep Edward in our hearts , " she prayed , reaching at last the still place in herselfwhich she had come to find . " Make him whole and active within us , able to overcome our guilt . " Dr. Willoughby stepped forward and began a passage which at first seemed unfamiliar , " Who bends not his eare to any bell which upon any occasion rings ? But who can remove it from that bell , which is passing a peece of himself out of this world ? " But then like a musical phrase , forgottenbut bringing back in total recall whole areas long buried , the quiet voice went on , " No man is an Iland , intire of itself ; every man is a peece of the Continent , a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church before , the stillness of private thoughts , there now fell a completep220intense stillness and the separate individuals became one , lifted like a wave toward the presence of the dead , suddenlyalive among them in that communion which he had not been able to find in life  --  " if a Clod be washed away by the Sea , Europe is the lesse , as well as if a Promontorie were , as well as if a Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were ; any man 's death diminishes me , because I am involved in Mankinde ; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls , it tolls for thee . " Dr. Willoughby paused a moment before leading the congregation in the Lord 's Prayer , and in that second of deeply shared emotion , the thing they had all been waiting for came to pass . Isabel in the front pew alone felt the wave behind her , felt it lift her up beyond herself , like a release from bondage . Tenderness for her brother filled her like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does n't have to be torn to pieces any longer . " Forgive us our trespasses , as we forgive those who trespass against us . " Before anyone was prepared for it , before George Hastings knew what he was doing , the coffin was being carried down among them and out of the door . Now for the first time , Edward Cavan , the person , was among them . It was terribly evident that it was he himself who was leaving them in the long box . To George bearing the heavy weight on his shoulder , it had become a gesture of support and love , the gesture he had not been able to make that day so long ago when he could not answer . Only like this , Edward Cavan 's will gone , dead , could we be allowed to help , to support , to lift , to love . Pen , sitting at the back , saw his face , strained by the physical effort he was making , but at the same time dreadfully grieving . Why ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier between them . What is it that separates us ? They all turned to watch the four young men and their burden out through the open doors . They waited like people who have said a final good-bye and watched a living person go away forever , at loose ends , not knowing how themselves to get up and go , to break the spell . The snuffing out of the four candles touched Grace Kimlock like a cold wind . She got quickly up and went out as if she were being driven out . How strange to feel the icy October air outside , how strange too and lost she was , afraid to be seen with the tears streaming down her cheeks , running wildly to a taxi alone . It was so utterly finished for Edward and so utterly unfinished for her , abandoned , wholly abandoned here as if in a strange city , with nowhere to go , she felt  --  for her own house had become like an asylum to hold madness and inconsolable grief . " Where to , ma'am ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere  --  just drive along the river for a while . " She felt cut off , felt that if perhaps they could have followed the body to the cemetery , seen the earth cast upon it , then she would not have suffered like this , such utter and frightful isolation . But by now the coffin was halfway to the train and would travel miles and miles before it was laid to rest beside Edward 's mother in Medfield . They were driving under her beloved plane trees now , little yellowish leaves swept up into the gutters and the river leaden gray , ruffled by the wind , past the bridges , the white and red Harvard Houses . The familiar sights were soothing , the boy in a scull alone was soothing  --  she sat up and leaned atp222the window to watch him , blowing her nose  --  the relief it was , after stifling her tears , the relief of being able to make the comfortable blowing noise ! " Whose funeral was it , ma'am ? " the driver , sensitive to her change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The guy who jumped under a subway train the other day ? " " Yes . " " Gee , " said the driver , " tough going ... " He was a fat middle-aged man , she noticed , with many wrinkles round his eyes . He looked kind and rather tired and easy-going , and she thought how restful it is to talk to a stranger when one is desperate , restful because one is not responsible and nothing one says matters . " I go past those buildings every day  --  Harvard , " he said , " and think about all the rich boys up there , studying , learning everything , rowing on the river , taking their time . " He laughed a slightly self-conscious laugh . " I never even finished grade school myself . Funny that one of them , a professor , you say , would get desperate . He must have been in a bad way . He was rich too , by what I read in the paper . You 'd think he could have taken a vacation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on Grace Kimlock like fresh air in a stifling room . She discovered that she was smiling . " You can turn back now , " she announced , giving him her address . " I 'd better go home . Somebody might telephone , " she said , suddenly hopeful . " I must be there . "  |p223Julia  and Damon walked home in silence . Now that it was over , the occasion which had supported them , Damon looked haggard and frantic . Julia felt completely passive , an automaton walking step by step across the Common , thrown back into life from the moment of peace , of communionin the church , feeling exhausted as if she could sleep for weeks and not sleep out the exhaustion at the bone . She noticed Damon swinging his arms , playing with his watch chain , like a nervous puppet , adjusting his watch to the Memorial Hall clock as they passed it , scanning the sky , casting , she knew , anxious glances at her , half irritated by her silence . " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own path , " that 's over , " but it was not clear whether he meant Edward 's funeral or their uncomfortably silent walk.  | " Is it ? I feel it 's just beginning , " and she did not know which she was answering , for her question fitted them both . " I must see to the furnace , " he said , evading her . " It 's beastly cold all of a sudden , Julia . " The heart has gone , Julia thought , in a kind of panic . The heart has just gone . We 're left here alone . When he came upstairs from the cellar she had two old-fashioneds ready . " I thought  --  a drink . . . " she said , afraid now that it had been the wrong idea . Perhaps it would be safer not to talk . " Wonderful . " Damon was tearing open the mail , flingingenvelopes carelessly torn open into the wastebasket , then he sat down with the New Yorker , unfolded it eagerly and began to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if they dropped life along the way and now he would pick it up again . Just then he laughed aloud . " Look at this , Julia  --  it 's perfect . " She looked at it , a George Price woman shooting a terrifyingly alive lobster with a pistol . It was very funny , but she could n't laugh . The laugh stuck in her throat like a bone . " Do n't you think it 's funny ? " he pursued her in a grieved tone . " Life goes on , Julia , " he said crossly . " I ca n't help it . " " I 'm sorry . I just ca n't react . The machine has stopped functioning , Damon . Give me a little time . " He was pulling at his eyebrows sourly , drinking his drink too fast . The heart has gone , she thought again , in panic . We have never loved each other . " People should be at their own funerals , " he said.  | " Edward would have lived  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known what his funeral would be like . " He said it half-humorously . " It did seem for a moment as if we were sharing , as if we were part of one another . It was that old familiar Donne , was n't it ? " Talk welled up in her like a saving grace . The dreadful arid desert was somehow crossed . They could avoid the emptiness if they talked loudly enough , long enough , drank enough . " That  --  and just the people  --  Tanner and Wadsworth up from Columbia  --  quite a thing , that  --  and Warlock , " Damon said with satisfaction as if each of these names were a medal to be pinned on Edward 's chest . He killed himself , but Warlock came to the funeral , Julia thought bitterly . " Pretty lonely for Isabel , I must say . And now she 's got to spend the afternoon trying to get the will straightened out . I hear it 's a mess . The lawyers will get everything they can for the family , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's an unconscionably long time a-dying . " Julia wished that it were really over , that they would not have to talk about it any more , yet she knew they would have to talk about it still for a long , long time , get under these surfaces to their own wounds and somehow lick them clean . " What a queer thing to say ! " " Was it ? I guess I resent this feeling of carrying his death all the time inside me , like a dead foetus  --  when shall we be free of it , Damon ? " " Oh for Christ 's sake , Julia . He 's dead now . That 's what funerals are for , to make it final  --  did n't you feel at all relieved ? I did . " He was quite cross . She had known he would be.  | " Yes , I 'm sure you did . " You move so fast , Damon , do you ever catch up with yourself ? she wanted to ask . But what was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter . " " Do I ? I did n't mean to . I 'd better get us some lunch . Pour yourself another drink  --  I 'll only be a minute . " But am I right always to smooth things over , never to be honest with him ? she asked herself , busy in the kitchen , mixing the salad . Whatever we are , we are together . If he fails , I 've failed him . When you marry someone you become a kind of Siamese twin  --  a woman does , anyway . These were her thoughts as she laid the table , set out the salads , the glasses of milk , the bread and butter . But when she called Damon in , she saw at once that it had been a mistake to leave him alone . He was sitting hunched over , a cigarette burned almost down to the end in his mouth , and when he looked up at her , she instinctively lowered her eyes , made shy by the nakedness of his misery . " Come along and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not hungry . " " Well , come along anyway and talk to me while I eat . I 'm starving . " So she lifted him , cajoled him like a sick child . He groaned , then came and put an arm round her casually . " Precious love , " he said , " what would I do without you ? " Yes , when he was down to the lowest ebb , he needed her , she thought , and as always she was stirred , she was alive with feeling for him , the instinctive reaction of a nurse to a wound . But would he ever come back to her in love when he felt well , powerful , when he had something to give ? He ate his lunch ravenously , as he talked , as it allp227poured out . " It was that Donne thing  --  I thought of how things were back there in thirty-six  --  Spain  --  Edward and I used to go out as a team and talk to church groups all over the state . Do you remember ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith campaign too  --  the first Roosevelt campaign . Where has it all gone , Julia ? God knows , there was plenty of opposition . We were a small enough minority . But it was a clean clear struggle  --  or seemed to be . I expect we were fooled about Spain and that was the beginning of the mess . . . . " He was not looking at her , but beyond her now , into his own history . " Really only the Catholics and the Communists can be quite clear in their minds now , " she answered . " Everything in between , everything that will not take refuge in a dogma , close the windows and doors , is in jeopardy , in flux  --  What shall we leave the children ? " " The instinct to resist oppression , whatever form it takes , " he came back with a bounce . It was thus that she loved him , when he suddenly pulled himself up short , shot out with basic conviction , putting a huge pat of butter on his roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality in the man ! She could see him swinging himself up on his own words as on a ladder  --  like an acrobat . " Edward would have agreed with that , " she said warmly . " Maybe we 've become too complicated , maybe we have to get back to such simple ideas  --  love , generosity  --  whatever the risk  --  " " Could I have called him back ? " Damon asked her straight out . The question came as a shock . She had no time to preparean answer . " Darling , I do n't know "  | " IIe called me a coward and a cheat  --  that 's what it amounted to . " " You called him a fuzzy-minded fool  --  it 's poison to remember , " she went on quickly , " you were too angry , each of you to say anything worth remembering , Damon . That is the truth , and you know it is . " " But if Edward and I could get that angry , could hurt each other that much , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Julia , the wild animals we are becoming " " I know . . . . " " What 's left ? " he said very quietly . The room lurched around them . Everything solid seemed to be dissolving , so Julia felt . Yet she clung to the little scattered pieces of truth , she tried to fit them together . She leaned back and closed her eyes . " You do n't really think Edward was right , do you ? " All his self-doubt rose up in his question , and she opened her eyes to meet his across the table . " No . I think he was wrong . How shall I say it ? Rationallywrong , somehow right all the same , for himself , in himself . It 's like Grace Kimlock . It 's much easier to be that uncompromisingperson than to be you , Damon . It 's harder to stand in the middle and try to see clearly , to admit  --  we have to admit it  --  that we were blind to the danger of communism , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard to admit that . I know what it cost you to get out of the Progressive Party , even if Edward did n't , could n't know it . " They had not spoken out so honestly to each other for a long time . The coffee bubbled in the percolator . It was warm here in the big old-fashioned kitchen . And Julia looked around it gratefully , at the pots of African violets on the window sill , at the Currier and Ives calendar of Thanks/giving Day on the wall . She felt released , freed from some prison , the prison of her narrow resentment of Damon . Two days ago she would have been incapable of the real inner gesture of respect and love from which her words had come . If things were right at the center , might n't one from there reach out into the world in concentric circles ? Did it all in the end come back to personal relationships after all ? She felt his eyes on her face like a touch , was suddenly shy . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing his delighted laugh . " Oh Julia . . . " He came round the table and kissed the top of her head , then went to get the coffee off the stove . More than the kiss this meant , I love you . For it was rarely that Damon helped her in any way about the kitchen or house . When he did , it was like an endearment . " Thank you , darling . " They drank their coffee in silence , for there was no longer the driving need to batter down barriers with words . " That Isabel is a very attractive woman , " Damon said , leaning back in his chair , relaxed , smoking a cigarette . " I suppose she is . " Julia hesitated . " I felt so sorry for her .

" " You see too much , Julia , " he was half-amused , halfirritated . " You 're pretty transparent , my friend . " " Yes . " But his thoughts were running on . " Edward was intact too . Something held them back , stopped them in that family . Oh , Julia , if Edward could have looked at a woman like that " " Do n't , " Julia said . She could n't bear this . It seemed queer , almost sacrilegious while the coffin hurtled across the country in the train . " Let him rest in peace . " What had he wanted of her all those years , when the children were babies and he had come to sit in the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit there , smoking and talking , and watching her , making her slightly uncomfortable ? At one time , she supposed , she had been on the point of falling in love with him , with the warmth of his understanding , with something young and very pure that flowed out from him , so guarded , so shy . It crossed her mind like a pang that she had never taken him in her arms , never hugged him hard , not passionately , but just for love , that all such contact could not take place because of something in him . The loneliness of it welled up inside her and suddenly she put her head down on her hands and began to cry . " Julia , what is it ? Do n't , for God 's sake . " She knew he could n't bear her tears . It made Damon wild with irritationwhen she cried . " It 's  --  the s-sep-separateness , it 's the 1-loneliness  --  " not just Edward , all of us , she thought , human beings . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his escape.  |p231Isabel  was ashamed at her own relief . Ever since the funeralshe had been buoyed up like an actress who has got through a first night safely after the agonies of nerves and who has come through the fiery furnace of the critics comparativelyunscathed . Now she could turn her heart towardhome  --  she would take a plane the next morning . She would no longer have to wear the mask of their grief , nor listen to their interpretations of her brother 's life and death , but only to find her own . She was free . In fact she was borne up now by a kind of excitement as she made her way through the narrow cliffs of downtown Boston , busy , grimy , but giving her a sense of security , of a world she could understand . Here Cambridge , the University , were as she wished them to be , unreal , noble no doubt , oh yes , touching , even important in their way , but here she felt , looking up at the serried windows of lawyers ' offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world got done . This was real in a way she could better understand , which did not frighten her . Almost she looked forward to the meeting ahead , in which it seemed , she would have to go over the will with Edward 's lawyer . This would be a factual affair , a matter of signing documents . Pain , confusion , guilt  --  these would be formally held at bay . There would be no terrifying old lady with piercing eyes to read her thoughts , no foreign delicate old man whose clear blue eyes accused her of things she could not even imagine . Last night she had gone to bed in a state of exhaustion , wondering how these peoplemanaged to live in an atmosphere of such strain , such self-accusation , constantly worrying about responsibilities which seemed to her nebulous in the extreme . What did it matter really whether some physics professor voted for Truman or for Wallace ? And why would doing either one be called treachery ? She was willing to grant that Edward had been probably a wonderful professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to rub it in , insist , beat her over the head with it ? It seemed to her that night that these people elevated talk into a semblance of action and mistook words for deeds . But this , as her husband often said , was the trouble with intellectuals anyway . " They build their own mazes and get lost in them , " he had said more than once , with a comfortable chuckle . How childish it all seemed to her , just as they had appeared to her like children that night at the Phillipses ' , precocious children who did not know anything about life . It was another thing to perform a delicate operation on a lung , to heal the sick as Henry did . That , she felt , was real . And if these peoplep233ever went into politics and got their hands dirty , that might seem real too . She was walking quite fast and realized that these thoughts had taken her past the huge stone door of the office building where she was bound . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retraced her thoughts until she stood still , looking up at the huge wall above her and , for some reason , was forced to remember something else  --  that wave of exaltation which had lifted her for a moment in the church . Well , one must be allowed such moments  --  that was what a funeral was for . Now , standing on the street watching a newsboy call his papers in a halfhearted way and the traffic bumper to bumper in the narrow street , here in the noise and activity of real life , she felt that Dr. Willoughby 's choice of the great passage from Donne had been an indulgence , a loving but inaccurate gesture towardEdward 's beliefs . " No man is an Iland  --  " But no one ever was more an island , she thought , than poor dear Edward . In his isolation from ordinary human realities he had come to fatally wrong conclusions , as far as she could see . Could this be called " greatness " ? No , it was time to face the facts . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been moving for a moment ; she had even wept . Here she saw it for what it was . " People do n't crack up because they feel part of the world  --  that 's just nonsense , " she said , going through the revolving door in a swirl of self-assertion . She was going to the sixteenth floor , an appropriate height from which to look down on the tragic facts , on which to examine Edward 's final wishes . She had no ideap234how much of the money he had inherited was still available ; she suspected that Edward had given most of it away long ago . But of course it would be very pleasant if there were a legacy ... . " Come in , Mrs. Ferrier . " Mr. Wainwright was a small nervous man , very brisk and neat , wearing , Isabel noted a pink shirt and black tie with a gray flannel suit , which did n't go at all with his rather wizened kindly face and made him look rather like a monkey . There was someone else there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who came , she did not understand why , apparently from Iowa . Mr. Wainwright offered her a cigarette from the silver box on his immaculate desk and apologized for bringing her here on the day of the funeral , " but I understand that you are anxious to catch a plane tomorrow . " " Yes , what do I have to do , Mr. Wainwright ? Sign something ? " He leaned forward , to pull out a folder containing some papers which he opened on the desk . Then he took out a pair of old-fashioned steel-rimmed spectacles , put them on his nose and looked up over them at her with a faintly troubled air . All this was done methodically , slowly , and as if he was preparing a speech and did not know quite where to begin . " The estate is some fifty thousand dollars , mostly in property , Mrs. Ferrier "  --  he peered at her kindly and interruptedhimself . " Your brother was a very generous man , " he said with a smile . " I know that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must have given away roughly a hundred thousand.  | " Unfortunately , the will is not altogether clear . I believe we shall have to ask the Courts to appoint an administrator . You see , I 'm afraid your brother was in a rather troubled mind and did not realize that there might be legal difficulties . As a matter of fact , there are two wills , one very much written over and the second one , which we take to be the real one , witnessed two years after it was made . This presents certain problems . " " I do n't understand anything about all this . I leave it all to you , Mr. Wainwright . But may I ask just what is involved ? " " The main bequest is to Cornell College . " Mr. Wainwrightmade something like a bow in Mr. Rand 's direction . " Roughly thirty-five thousand dollars . " Mr. Rand leaned forward and coughed . " Cornell is deeply indebted to your brother , Mrs. Ferrier . " " Yes , " Isabel said crisply , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged a discreet smile . It was pleasant to be a part of the miffing of Harvard apparently . " Edward owed everything to Cornell . He always said so , " she added graciously . " He left his library to Harvard , however , " Mr. Wainwrightadded . " There are several bequests  --  including one to you Mrs. Ferrier  --  of one thousand dollars each . " Isabel caught her breath . She knew now that she had hoped for much more . It was indecent to be disappointed , but she was disappointed . " There will be no problem about these . They are quite clear in both wills . " " What is the trouble then ? " " It 's a matter of , roughly , five thousand dollars given to various organizations in which your brother took anp236interest . But unfortunately it 's just here that there is some confusion  --  this is a codicil ; it is crossed out and revised in three places . Money to be given to the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee seems now to be willed to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in ink , and looked at it , searching for the name  --  " The Socialist Monthly . " He looked up with a question in his eyes . " I know nothing about such things , " Isabel said quickly . Mr. Wainwright leaned back in his chair , placing the tips of his fingers together to make an arch . " We would on the whole prefer that these questionablebequests  --  the writing is not clear and there seem evidences of hesitation  --  as well of course as the matter of witnesses  --  be settled by the Court . In such cases , it is usual for the family to be the beneficiary . The law , as you no doubt know , is apt to tend towards recognizing the rights of the family  --  when there is doubt , of course  --  and there is doubt , Mrs. Ferrier . Very considerable doubt , I might add . " " It 's all rather unpleasant , " Isabel said . " Who are these people ? Wo n't they try to get the money ? " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursed his lips , " that would not be without precedent , " and he smiled a small smile . " This sort of organization , more especially , is apt to be rather touchy . They will consider it a matter of principle , no doubt . " Mr. Rand coughed , crossed his knees and assumed an air of judicial consideration . " If , as I understand it , the will reads that all amounts not directly specified are to gop237to Cornell  --  please forgive me , Mrs. Ferrier "  --  he smiled at her indulgently  --  " but you understand that I am speaking for the college , and must defend its interest  --  then , I would think that Cornell might have a prior claim ? " Money , Isabel thought , does queer things to people . She felt hot all over . She felt unaccountably angry  --  surely not about five thousand dollars ? Why did she feel so angry then ? " Well , that will be up to the Courts , surely , " she said . " It 's none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Wainwright included them both , " I shall go ahead and ask that an administrator be appointed . " " Well then , " Isabel said , shutting her bag , and pulling on a glove , " there is nothing more for us to do , is there ? " " Not at the moment , Mrs. Ferrier . " " Surely I can go back tomorrow ? " she asked in a panic . I have to go back , she thought . I ca n't stay here . They 're all enemies . Even Cornell in the last few moments had becomeher enemy . I 'm all alone here . It 's disgusting to be made to fight about five thousand dollars . " I see no reason why you ca n't , " Mr. Wainwright said soothingly , " but "  --  he took off his glasses and rubbed them with a handkerchief , rather ruefully  --  " you will probably have to come back  --  if the will is contested  --  and I fear  --  I fear we must expect that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was there no way out ? " And what if the family gives up all claims ? " " I would n't advise that , " said Mr. Wainwright , sitting up quite straight in his chair , " No , I would n't advise that , " he said . The implication was that justice was not to be trifled with by any human impulses of irritation or gener/osity . " And after all , five thousand dollars , Mrs. Ferrier . Perhaps I should n't say this  --  I say it as a friend of your brother 's and ex officio , so to speak  --  your brother was perhaps not always quite sound . I mean , these organizations , two of them at least are on the Attorney General 's list . We would not really wish your brother 's money to go into such hands , would we , Mrs. Ferrier ? " " Certainly not , " said Mr. Rand emphatically . " It 's his will after all , not ours , " she heard herself saying to her own astonishment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , of course , no doubt , " Mr. Wainwright said hastily , " but the question may be whether  --  how shall I say it ?  --  whether it was really his will , I mean  --  forgive me , but his mind was evidently somewhat unbalanced , Mrs. Ferrier " " If that can be proved , I presume it would invalidate the entire will , " she said with a smile , not looking at Mr. Rand though the smile , a smile of triumph was meant for him to swallow if he could . She had taken a dislike to Mr. Rand . Mr. Wainwright looked rather smugly at his hands . " You have a point , Mrs. Ferrier . You have an undoubtedpoint . " Doubt ? Confusion ? Guilt ? Had she imagined that they would not come up with her in the elevator to the sixteenth floor ? That they would be left behind on the street with the newsboys ? Was nothing of Edward to remain pure ? Was it all to be dragged through the press  --  even his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mess like all the rest . She felt it like ashes to eat , inside her , all around her , and she suddenly bowed her head , hid her face behindp239one hand as if to hide from the exposure , from life itself . " Could n't he have left a clear will ? " she groaned . But no , it was all mixed together , his body , his beliefs , his money , his blood all thrown down for the dogs to tear . There was no escape from what Edward had done . It was everywhere . Mr. Rand and Mr. Wainwright exchanged a glance . " You must get some rest , Mrs. Ferrier , " Mr. Rand saidquite gently . " All this is very upsetting for you . " " Yes , " she said drily , getting up , " yes , it is . " She had the key to Edward 's apartment in her pocket . Professor Fosca had given it to her and suggested that she might like to go there , perhaps to take back with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt involve the sale of his belongings , but meanwhile there was no reason why as a member of the family she should not take what she wanted . Actually , last night , she had thought with pleasure of finding something to give to each of the friends she had met ; she had looked forward to this one small positive gesture she might make while she was here . Now , although she hailed a taxi and gave the address on Mt . Vernon Street quite casually , she wished she could avoid this confrontation of things , this voluntary immersion into Edward 's atmosphere . She wanted above all to get away , to flee before some final defense she held hard against her like a shield , was battered down . And , as the taxi turned up Park Street and she found herself among grass and trees with the fine brick facade of the State House and its golden dome before her , she felt quite definitely that she was moving out of one world and into another . In the world of office buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthought she was . She had not been preparedp240for the violence of emotion which gathered quite irrationallyin her around Edward 's money , but still this was a matter of resenting the sordid quarrel ahead , a business matter . Business might be sordid , but it could be dealt with rationally . It was , in essence , impersonal . And as far as the will went , the responsibility , thank goodness would be with the law . It did not lie inside her own consciousness . If there was guilt , it was Edward 's for allowing his conscientiousscruples to affect in such a disturbing way the matter-of-fact business of a will . Now the taxi took her like fate into a world of private houses . She could not but feel their privacy , their distinction , the ineffable reserved air of them , brass knockers brightly polished , white doors gleaming to set off the warm , old , delightfully various red of the brick . Why had Edward chosen to live here rather than in Cambridge ? Was it a deliberate gesture of setting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a moment she would be , the habitation of some part of him held in reserve , not shared with students and faculty  --  in fact , his private life ? Isabel stood in the street and looked up at the long French windows on the second floor . There was no way of knowing from here that the apartment was frightfully empty , that it lay there , lying in wait , ready to pounce , ready to say " Intruder " to anyone who now forced the door . She felt the key in her hand . After all , she did not have to do this . She could walk down the hill intact . No one would ever know . She could escape whatever lay in wait for her up one flight of stairs , the flight of stairs down which Edwardhad walked with his life in his hands four days before . The temptation was very great . Almost she did not resistp241it . But now she was looking so hard at the windows , itseemed as if they held her like eyes and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , after all , possible to do that . She read the name on the mailbox , saw that it wasstuffed with mail , but she had no key and could not openit . Dead letters , she thought  --  what questions did they askwhich would never be answered ? What cries for help orconsolation or advice lay there ? She was conscious suddenlythat death breaks an enormous delicate web , thatthousands of tiny threads which held Edward to earth hadall been snapped , and it was not only his life , but all thelives that touched it , willfully snapped and left dangling . What anguish great enough to make one able to do this ? She leaned against the door , pushing her way in and veryslowly , as if she carried a heavy weight , difficult to balance , mounted the stairs , touching the wall on her right as shewent . And as she climbed step by step , it seemed with eachstep as if something fell away , so that year by year hadgone when she reached the landing and stood at the dooritself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlwhose mother had just died , whose brother had just died  --  absolutely naked and alone and terrified . It was all shecould do not to cry out , " Edward , where are you ? " as sheopened the door and stood with her back against it , closedbehind her , blinded by tears , by the aching need of hisvoice , so warm always in greeting , aching with the need ofsomeone to lead her to a chair , make her a cup of tea , someone to be there , not this utter emptiness and silence . The tears were an affront now that she was all eyes , needed above all to see . She forced them back , rubbed herface harshly with a handkerchief . Then she sat down in anarmchair by the empty hearth . Sun poured in through thep242long windows on the velvet curtains faded to amber , not a diffused light but a long wide beam in which motes of dust danced , and which fell on the bookcases and lit up a long row of Henry James 's novels in dark-blue bindings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a painting of Southern France  --  or perhaps New Mexico she thought as she looked at it  --  a small orchard through which one saw the outlines of a bare brown hill rising , but all this set low on the canvas so that what gave the painting its quality was the wide expanse of sky , the spaces it managed to suggest . On a low table beside her a copy of the New Republic carried an ugly black headline " The Un-American Dream . " She turned it over . It seemed , at the moment , irrelevant . For what caught her now after the first rush of emotion , was the extraordinaryquiet aliveness of the room . She picked up the ash tray beside her , inlaid enamel , bright blue and white , and turned it over . This Edward must have brought back from the Balkans two summers before . Perhaps someone had given it to him  --  he loved little presents , presents that meant places and people . She recognized over the bookcasea Picasso pen-and-ink drawing which he had bought while still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father found what it had cost . But that Chinese horse  --  that she had not seen before . She was feeling her way slowly into the room , into its life . It was not what she had expected  --  what had she expected ? Some sign of violent disturbance , of breakdown ? It was almost suspiciously calming here . A man did not walk out of a room like this to commit suicide . Whatever tore Edward to pieces was somewhere else , and so it seemed almost that he was not here , that what she had feared , the confrontation , would not take place . And it was too still , a stillness through whichp243the roar of a car going up the hill in second broke with ugly harsh insistence , bringing her to her feet . Edward , she felt herself crying out inwardly again , where are you ? In the bedroom , the narrow Spanish bed with its carved head , lay there like a corpse , a heavy dark green spread over it , the corners tucked in under the pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books which in the final analysis had not been able to help him . She noticed among them a leather-bound Imitation of Christ which his mother had given him at Christmas the year before she died . It had been obviously much read . There was a Bible , a volumeof critical essays by a man she had never heard of , a biography of Beatrice Webb , four small volumes of poetry by modern poets . One , a first book obviously , was dedicated to E.G. , she noticed . The others were Wallace Stevens , Marianne Moore and a worn and much-marked copy of Yeats 's Collected Poems . In the old days when she was Isabel Cavan , Edward had liked to read things aloud to her , and she opened the Yeats half fearfully as if she expected some ghost to rise from the pages , some answer to her question to be spoken aloud . But Edward was not going to give himself away , even now . The book was full of notes but they read like notes for a review . And this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside the pang for the girl she had been , Isabel Cavan , who read poetry late into the night and who had a brother alight with enthusiasm for it . All that was long ago , too long to be resurrected here in the dead apartment , the emptiness . Instead she moved over to the desk , set against the wall . Here she sat down facing his wall , her chin in her hands . There was nothing at all on the desk , not even a notebook or pencil . She reached out a hand to open ap244drawer , half opened it , then shut it again . She had not come here to pry . For what then ? She sat facing the wall , absolutely still , not even thinking , as if here she had come to a dead end in herself . Imagination had stopped working like a run-down clock . Yet actually she felt tremendously agitated , so nervous that she dared not look round . The apartment was full of presence , of intimation , of some silent communication . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no one here . There had been no one here when Edward was alive . He had lain alone on the narrow bed unable to sleep ( he had always suffered from insomnia even as a child ) . It was a dead house with a suffering , violently alive man locked in it , unable to get out , sitting in front of a wall . And all the lovely things , and their associations , the friendships they memorialized , the places , the times were there as if to plead against loneliness , to keep loneliness , separation , isolation at bay , as he himself held it rigidly away from him like a poison , flung himself into his work , made the careful notes in the volumes of poems early in the morning , or rushed off to a meeting of one of those suspect organizations where , she knew suddenly , he perhaps felt some communion , some temporary fugitive sense of common identity . Why ? That was the question she asked the wall . But walls have no answer and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing she looked around for a mirror . There was none . There was only the shadow of herself , Isabel Cavan , standing behind Isabel Ferrier . She had not come here so fearfully then to be confronted by Edward , or Edward 's life but by her own . The answer to the question was inextricably mixed up with other ques/lions , and these other questions were what she had feared . " No man is an Iland . " Edward was not . Somewhere he was " attached to the Maine , " and in a flash of realization she saw the coffin , lurching in some freight car , but moving slowly towards its rest in the grave beside their mother . He might have been confused at the end about where and to whom to leave his money , but about this there had been no confusion . He had asked to be buried beside his mother . How could so much light hold so much darkness in it ? For their mother , it seemed , had been a creature of the light . Isabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight on flowers , of the patient hands , rough from much gardening , transplanting seedlings or putting stakes in to hold up the falling chrysanthemums . She could not think of her without thinking of the way her eyes brimmed with light  --  there was no other word , very large blue eyes that sometimes looked gray and sometimes deep blue , it depended on the time of day , on what she was wearing . And she could not think of her without the acute memory of the high tension , the strain of wild poetry in her which even marriage to their father had not subdued . Must one hate one 's father if one loves one 's mother ? Edward 's answer , given without hesitation , had proved to be " yes . " In the marrow of his bones even when he was a small child he had been aware that she was stifled , that something that should have been free and glowing was bound back , held still by a marriage where passion had not been able to transcend almost complete incompatibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long above all for a life without strain , for peace , for a relationshipwithout ecstasies but also without tensions . She had always been the peacemaker , moving between her fatherp246and mother like a little thread , sewing them together again , unwilling to allow them the separation both perhaps deeply desired . What had it done to Edward , this marriage he had entered into and suffered as if it were his own  --  even as quite a small boy . It had made his loyalty intransigentand narrow , deepened him , tightened him , matured him  --  and , in the end , murdered him . It was the wall beforewhich he sat , in his fifties . Whatever his friends across the river might say about the state of the world , the tensions  --  wefind our way out into the world from childhood . The pattern is set there . And his pattern had been to witness , to suffer wholly with and for his mother , but to be unable to act to save her . To be a witness , what could suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as marriage and children had been to her , but to be left , naked , the witness always , the one who is aware and can do nothing ? For a brief time in college it had seemed that he would be able to free himself , but his mother 's death , the illness kept from him at her wish , so that he might accomplish all that he dreamed that year in Oxford  --  that had locked the prison door fast . You ca n't save people from their lives , Isabel said to herself . Mother was wrong there  --  binding him hand and foot where freedom had been her intention . ... Well , he was out of the prison now . Isabel walked out of the bedroom and went to the French windows and pushed them open . She lit a cigarette and stood smoking it . Someone passing by , she thought , would imagine I lived here . She smiled . It was almost a shock to lay for a moment the image of her own house against this one  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze to which packs of childrenp247went constantly to open pints of ice cream , air and sun and wind flowing in and out , and cocktails for Henry when he came home , tired , wanting only to relax over a game of bridge after dinner , untroubled , in the midst of life , voting the straight Republican ticket , secure behind the walls of their life . Walls ? Yes , said Isabel Cavan , taking a long look at California from Boston , at Isabel Ferrier 's life from IsabelCavan 's . We have paid something for peace of mind . What ? Her eyes , roving round the room again as if in search for something fell on the New Republic she had turned over . She went and picked it up , disliking the rough cheap paper and the thick black headlines . It seemed to shout and yell , so one could not trust what it said , yet she found herselfreading  --  people were losing their jobs , professors in state universities , because they believed in the things Edwardhad believed in , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt at their own safety and immunity , by their desire for " solidarity "  --  she remembered suddenly Edward using that word , apropos of Walt Whitman , was it ? Long , long ago . Here , in this room , so empty of any human ties , swung as it were a little above the human world , where her brother , the witness , had sat in his silent agonies of isolation , she felt suddenly dizzy with what she saw , what opened out , the whole world like a cry , like a needBut this is an emotional response , she told herself quickly . Unless Edward had committed suicide , I would not feel it . . . .  |p248Because  he had n't seen Pen since the awful thing happened  --  and that was three days ago now , George counted  --  he felt as if he were coming back to her from some strange land , from a long journey . He was always nervous as he turned the corner onto Shepard Street and looked up at the lights in the dormitories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Eliot and being looked over by the girl at the switchboard and the one or two other fellows sitting in self-consciously relaxed attitudes in the living room waiting for their dates , which made him feel out of place , old and cynical on the one hand , on the other just ill at ease and gauche . It had happened more than once that one of his English students was there , for intance , and this for some reason was especially embarrassing . He adjusted his tie , scuffed at some leaves like a schoolboyand turned up the cement walk , through the big white pillars at the door , berating himself for his embarrassment.  |p249He  asked in a firm voice for Miss Pen Wallace and sat down on the bench in the hall to wait . For once there was no one around . " Hi , how 've you been ? " she was saying , as she stood up . They exchanged the meaningless greetings meant for the lighted hall : " I like your dress , " " Oh , good , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , under which their real selves floated in suspense , carried them through the door . But as soon as they had turned off the cement path onto the brick of the street , George took her hand hard in his , and they walked like that as far as Avon Street in an oppressed silence . George wondered sometimes if she had any idea how charged such moments were for him , how locked up and stifled he felt as the great rush of his feeling when he first saw her , even after a few hours , was being dammed up to reasonable proportions . " Oh Pen . . . " " he said . " Where are we going , darling ? " Her light bright voice denied the appeal , but that was the way she always was . She had to get used to him too , to get back to being human after those long hours of concentrating on a translation of Horace or some medieval Latin text . George reminded himself of this and tried not to feel rejected . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be our direction . " She was looking around her with that eager look , as if she could not have enough of life , as if when she emerged from the dorm everything hit her freshly . He followed her glance to the white frame house they were passing , the old pear tree , the rather wild garden where uncut stalks of autumn flowers stood about , and a cat with its paws tucked in sat on the step.  | " Oh , I do love Cambridge , " she said . " I do love these houses , and all the trees . Who do you suppose lives there ? " " Some old maid , I expect . " She felt the unresponsivenessto this game they usually played together with enthusiasm . " I know , George , " she answered something he had not said , " only , let 's wait till we 're settled . Then we can really talk . Forget it for a few moments , darling "  --  she turned her face , looking at him gravely  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she slipped her hand through his again , so it was all right . But after that , they both felt a little stiff and walked fast as if they were hurrying to a shelter . Once Pen stopped to smell leaves burning somewhere in a distant garden and sighed . " Sometimes I feel as if I were saying good-bye to everything every moment . It 's awful to be a senior . I did n't know how awful it would be . " This brought back to George his recent doubts  --  would he be here next year himself ? But he would not start off on this with Pen . It was too shameful . What did it matter whether he got his instructorship or not ? And he swore suddenly under his breath . " What ? " " Nothing . " The bright lights of the Midget were ahead of them now . But this was home , unlike the dormitory , and they walked in boldly , looking around to see who was there , hailing a couple in another booth and then sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what Pen meant by being " settled . " " You look awful , George darling . What have you been doing ? " " Nothing "  --  he frowned  --  " drinking  --  thinking  --  hat/ing those lousy little Groton boys who do n't bother to show up for English A. " But he did n't smile , just ordered two dark ales in a businesslike way and lit Pen 's cigarette and his own . " Well , you certainly have a champion in Alice Evans . " Pen , he knew , was trying to get him to smile , but he would n't fall for it . " She bores us to tears with tales of how wonderful you are , and when Towser came to lunch , " she went on rather nervously , " the poor guy had to listen to how wonderful you were till he actually got quite cross . " There was no rise in George , susceptible though he was about his teaching , catching at the crumbs of praise , like any other of the teaching fellows who lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their own , and as touchy as prima donnas . " You do n't need to , Pen , " he said in a tired voice . " Not tonight . " " Sorry , I guess I got off on the wrong foot . I guess I 'm scared , " she said , puffing at her cigarette as if she had never smoked one before , then suddenly stamping it out as if it tasted bad . " I guess this has been a pretty tough time for you , George . I 'm sorry , dear . " The waitress brought their beer and George felt the tight knot inside him relax a fraction . When Pen said " dear , " she meant it . " Darling " meant nothing at all . " I 'd just got to the point when I thought I knew what I was doing  --  I almost called you that night , I was so excited "  --  hefound it unexpectedly difficult to talk . It was as if there were some obstruction in his throat and his voice came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like a whirlpool . I just go round and round . " " It 's thrown the whole college , George . It 's not justp252you . Girls in the dorm cried and carried on like nobody 's business . " There was , he noticed , a slight edge in her voice . " Well , you understood something about it at that seminar , did n't you ? Do you remember what you said , that it was altogether different from any course you 'd had , did n't seem like Harvard ? " He asked sternly . He had not liked her tone . " I 'm glad you took me . Awfully glad . " But she was following some track of her own . " What I do n't get is the political angle , George . " It struck George like a blow , the coldness of her tone , the perfect detachment . There was something relentless about this girl , something relentless even in her eagerness , her brilliance , something which did n't want to give , did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on another level than sex . Recognizing it , he felt exhausted . " I guess I 'm too confused to talk , " he said miserably . " But to commit suicide for political reasons seems to me crazy , " she pleaded . " Do n't you think so ? " " Masaryk did . " " Who was he ? " she asked absent-mindedly . " Good God , Pen , you live in this world , do n't you ? " He was suddenly furious . " Maybe you do n't . " " Well , do n't blow up . I remember now , of course . But he was right in the middle of things . There was no way out for him . This seems like such a waste . " The warm light flowed back into her face , and she said quite humbly , " Talk to me , George . Try to tell me . I 've felt so queer and lonely , not being really part of all this . Except "  --  she reached across to him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you in your work . "  | " It 's not that , " he said quickly , brushing his work aside . " Tell me , George , try to tell me , " she said , becoming again the girl he loved and not the antagonist he had seen a moment ago , the unyielding girl , the girl locked up against feeling . " Well "  --  he did not know how to begin , where to begin  --  " yousee , one of the things that bothers me is that I 'm not a political person either . None of us are , really , are we ? " He looked to her now for support , for justification . " I mean , my generation did n't have that kind of faith . Are we wrong , Pen , are we terribly wrong ? " he asked desperately , and went on without waiting for her answer , " I have a feeling now that Cavan must have felt that nobody really cared , you know . Lately it must have been lonely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't working out , you see . " " Did he talk about it ? " Pen asked . " No "  --  and then the taut look came back into George 's face  --  " I expect he knew I was n't really interested . Besides , you know how it is , I saw him in conferences  --  we had work to do . " Sometimes he could see thought in Pen 's face like something flowing across it , a tangible reality . " What are you thinking ? " " I do n't know , " she said , brushing her hair off her face with one hand , leaning forward so her face almost touched the beer glass , in that odd concentrated position he knew well , and found slightly irritating for he always had an impulse to say , " Sit up , " she was so curled over , stoopshouldered , turned inward . " They seem very young some-times " They have something we have n't got . I think maybe partly they believed in the wars they fought " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on where she had left off . This was their relationship , this meant they were in the groove , a kind of dual monologue in which they thought of things they would not have thought of alone , yet which seemed at times to have little connection with each other . " My father gets so het up , runs for office , works himself hoarse and exhausted and never gets any-where . " " You never told me that . I thought your father raised some queer kind of flower " Oh yes , wood peonies . But he goes on periodic politicalbinges as well . He 's a single-tax Republican  --  in a small Connecticut town . You can imagine ! " Suddenly they were laughing . They drank their beer down soberly , but then each time they looked up and caught each other 's eye they were overcome with laughter , why they did n't quite know , the folly of their parents ' generation , perhaps , perhaps just pleasure in having come through to this easier moment , of being safe from all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were on an island of laughter alone . " Oh , I do love you , Pen . " " I know , darling . . . . " She still had the laughter and he had lost it . " No , you do n't know . You do n't really want to know , do you ? " George asked gently . " Talk about how young they are , " she commanded , evading him . " I know what you mean . It 's like innocence . But Cavan was different  --  too intelligent perhaps . Why do I talk aboutp255him like this ? " George broke into what he was saying , " It 's disgusting . " " I do n't see why . " " Everybody prying into him , trying to get underneath , trying to break it down and analyze it , something so awful he died because of it , and all we do is peer and pry  --  and do n't know what it was , and never will know what it was  --  " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a rising wave of power inside him . " Why did you love him so , George ? What was it ? " " Did I love him ? " George balked at the word . He was startled by it . " Well , if you did n't , why are you so upset ? " She could be so darned logical at times , it was peculiar . " Well for one thing , " he said in a hard voice , " he would have got me an instructorship next year , if you must know " " I 've thought of that , " she said gently . " But that 's another thing . I mean your feeling about him . " " I 'm sorry . Maybe his passion for excellence , the standardhe set , the breadth and depth of the standard , " he answered her now , on the rising wave . " For instance , this . Years ago when I was in a seminar . We read papers and he used to get up and stand at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I read one of Thoreau 's poems and right in the middle of one poem I stopped and said , God , that 's good ! ' I just had to because the line struck me just at that moment . Cavan was sitting and he rapped hard on the table with his knuckles and said , Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! ' That was all , but I 've never forgotten it , the concentratedpassion of it . That was the quality he had as a teacher , and I begin to think he had it partly because hep256had it about everything . I mean , would he have cared in the same way about literature if he had n't been involved in human affairs themselves ? That 's the real question , Pen . " " You mean we do n't care enough ? We 're not , as he seems to have been , passionate people ?  --  you mean , we 're afraid ? " " Want to play it safe , do n't stick our necks out , sit tight  --  all the rot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never sheltered , never allowed himself to be . " " And cracked up , " Pen interrupted the fine flow flatly . " God damn it , yes , and maybe that 's better than becoming a fossil ! " George had raised his voice . " What 's eating you , George ? Such profanity ! " came a man 's voice from the next booth . Hoffman 's head appeared over it , assistant professor giving one of the Humanities courses . George flushed and subsided . " I was talking about Edward Cavan , " he said stiffly as Hoffman , conjured up like a puppet , stayed there , owlishly . " Yes , the poor guy , " Hoffman shook his head , " could n't take it , I 'm afraid . A bad business . You were working with him on your thesis , were n't you ? Bad luck , old chap . I 'm sorry , " and with that , mercifully , Hoffman got up and took his check . " You see what I mean ? " George muttered after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much feeling as a stuffed cod . I suppose he thinks he may get promoted now . " And then as if the full impact of this hit him after he 'd said it , George sank back . " Imagine it , Pen ! That idiot in Cavan 's chair . Oh my God " " It is rather grim , " Pen said earnestly , " but he wo n't get it of course . There must be a good many sharks afterp257the dead body . He would n't really have a chance , would he ? " " I do n't know . " George waved to the waitress for anotherale . " You 're a cynical little piece are n't you ? " he went on , glad now of a chance to change the subject . " I do n't think so . I save my strength . I should think you 'd be dead at the end of the day , old chap , old boy , " she mimicked Hoffman . " Take it easy , that 's what I always say " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up  --  what was her name Kitman ? Armlock ? Something like that . Some friend of Cavan 's . I was awfully rude to her , I 'm afraid  --  I was drunk , as a matter of fact . Ever hear of her ? " " Not Grace Kimlock ? " Pen sat up straight for once . " Yes  --  yes  --  that must have been it . Why , do you know her ? " " I 've met her  --  she 's a distant cousin on my mother 's side . As a matter of fact , she 's a good egg , George . You 'd like her , and it 's quite true-I remember now , Edward Cavan was always there . They must have been great friends . She 's a loon about anything political . My father calls her raving mad and thinks she 's a Communist . I would n't be surprised , as a matter of fact . I 'll take you there if you like  --  if you care "  --  she seemed to hesitate now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to , " George said quickly . " I 'd like to very much . " " She devours young men . You 'd better look out . She 'll have you running errands for the Party before you know it  --  " You 're not serious , Pen ? She 's not really a Commu-nist ? "  | " Of course not , silly . She 's just one of these old Boston pinkos who trots up and down Beacon Hill to make speeches at State House committees and prides herself on knowing the Irish politicians by their first names and imagines that without her , no good would come of Massachusetts law . You know the type  --  as a matter of fact , she 's quite a darling , " Pen said unexpectedly . " I always meant to see more of her . " She smiled across at him , happy because this was like a present she could give him . " You look bemused , darling . " " Gee , Pen , that 's wonderful , " he said again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But tomorrow is n't this minute . Sit down again . You have n't finished your beer . " " I 've got to get back and study , George . I really must , " she drank it down standing . " Come on . . . . " It was the beginning of the end . Always when George saw Pen it seemed as if their meeting rose on a curve and then at a certain moment , the high point of the curve was passed . When was that moment ? He had never been able to seize it , but only to realize that it was gone , that they were slipping down . In all this year they had come to no place of real understanding . Always he must wonder if she would let him kiss her at the door , just before the public dormitory world took her back again , never could he take anything for granted , even after all these months . He could feel her stiffening withdrawal as they turned in to Shepard Street and she lit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his roommatewould say , " they do it on purpose , have it all figured out , " but Pen was not like that . There was some wild naturalforce in her that made her leap away at a touch likep259a deer . She would not say that she loved him . She would never never say it . Now as they walked side by side in the damp autumn dark , walked past the lighted houses where safely married people sat and read , had a place of their own , George felt she was a stranger , a total stranger . Talkingabout Cavan had n't helped . The only thing that might have helped would have been if he could have laid his head on her breast a moment and rested there . " What are you laughing at ? " she asked . " Oh , the craziness of it all , the way people try to meet and communicate and never quite do , " he said bitterly . " Yes , " she spoke quickly , " I know . " This was the moment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid masterful gesture , but he was paralyzed , paralyzed by the dormitory lights , by the imminenceof parting so his throat felt dry , and he walked very fast , almost running . " I 'm afraid I have n't been much help , darling . " He could feel her quick breathing beside him and locked her hand into his , all the sexual impulse dying away , in the force of his feeling about Cavan . " Some things , I guess , people go through alone . Talkingdoes n't really help . But it 's all right , Pen . " For one second he looked down into her clear , aloof gaze in which there was , after all , no tenderness because she was afraid to let it through . And then , without even saying good night , he turned and ran down the path , wanting more than anything now to be alone , to be free of her , to smell the autumn night and walk himself into exhaustion . " Good night , " she called after him . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she waved.  |p260On  Garden Street , out of sight , he slowed down and took a deep breath . He was thinking now not of her at all , as if on the stream of his feeling for her , he had been carriedout to a new understanding of Cavan . What if this kind of frustration and paralysis were not bound to one person and one 's relation to them , but to everything around one ? " These doors that close in one 's face , this trying to get through as if one were a prisoner in a cell knocking patiently on the wall , but nobody answers .... " Standing on the street where so many people lived , seeing how the light from the street lamp shone gold on the golden maple leaves , hearing the steady pulse of the crickets in the grassy gardens , this peace , this intimacy which was Cambridge enveloped him in its gentleness . The long tension he had held unbroken in himself for forty-eight hours was released . For a moment at least he stood outside his frustrating love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consoled by simply being himself . He thought of his students and what he would say to them tomorrow . He felt that his one responsibilitynow , and it was Cavan who laid it upon him and whose death demanded it , was to get through , was not to be stopped , was to arrive at communion with other people somehow and at communion with a whole self in himself.  |p261The  old chestnut tree on Brattle Street had flowered and shed its leaves five times since Orlando Fosca had been so troubled when a branch was blown down , had had an impulse to go in and ask whether surgeons had been sent for , had stopped to see in the wounded tree a symbol of the University itself , just so wounded by the death of EdwardCavan . The tarred break was hardly noticeable now ; on her short walks Grace Kimlock sometimes wondered exactly where the branch had been , how the tree had looked ; one no longer felt absence in the air , or looked for leaves where there were none . The absence of Orlando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the impulse to phone him , then sat down with the instrument in her hands , abstracted until Ellen roused her . Orlando had died quite suddenly a year before , late at night , of a brain hemorrhage while he worked at his desk . He wasp262found only the next morning . Since then Grace Kimlock had felt surrounded by ghosts , for the first time in her long life really afraid of the present , a present which bewildered her . There seemed nothing to hang onto at all in this time when the renegade and the informer were the heroes of the day and the things one had always taken for granted like honor , trust , the very foundations of the human compact , were being subtly undermined . Lately she had almost entirely withdrawn from public life , and saw only very old friends like Damon . She was quite suddenly an old lady . Yet on this morning she woke with some of her former battling self back in play ; as if to underline the importance of the day she took out the cameo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clasped it firmly to her new bright blue blouse , and as she peered at herself in the mirror to be sure it was not on crooked , she lifted her chin and gave a little wry smile , as if to say , " We 're not dead yet , old thing . " In the kitchen Ellen and the cook noted that she had eaten almost no breakfast . " She 's that excited . It 's about Mr. Phillips , you may be sure , the poor man . He 's to be questioned , you know . They 're after him , " Ellen said gloomily . She was not very sure who " they " were , but she had heard Grace telephoning all day yesterday , summoningthe thinning ranks to the open session of a Washington Committee sent down to look into communism at Harvard University . " She 's afraid he 'll lose his temper , the poor man , that 's what she 's got so nervy about , " cook answered . " As well he might , " Ellen answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well it 's a dangerous time and you never know , " cook said shaking her head . " They have to do their job like the rest of us . " " Miss Kimlock says it 's a dirty job . That 's what she told me . She told me they had n't caught any Communists anyway . It 's just for publicity , that 's what she told me , " Ellen said quite belligerently . Cook , unperturbed , chuckled . " She 's agin the government . Always has been . You 'd think she came from the old country the way she carries on against them all " And a good thing too , " Ellen said , quite hot . " There 's nothing wrong with the old country . " " Now , now , I did n't say there was , did I ? " and cook chuckled again , her arms deep in soapsuds . " Well , we 'd best get on with it now , Ellen , if we 're to get through and see it all on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , told me five times if she told me once that she intendsfor us to watch it . " Ellen sighed as she took a bunch of silver up into her towel . " What 's the matter now ? " " I was thinking of Horace . I never thought I 'd miss that old cat the way I do , throwing up good haddock the way he did , turning up his nose at anything you 'd cook for him . It 's a strange thing the way he used to sit outside the door just waiting like a saint , never a mew out of him . " " Times have changed , " cook said gruffly , " we 've seen a lot come and go these last years . It 's a sad business al-together . " Yet in the general gloom which the kitchen reflected there were points of light . In the last years Grace had got very fond of Pen and George , safely married at last whenp264George got his assistant professorship . The way George dropped in when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Edward . But he was gentler than Edward , a great asker of questions ; Grace found herselfdigging out old scrapbooks about the Anarchists , tellingGeorge about Sacco and Vanzetti , reliving it all for him , and especially lately when he was bothered , so he said , by the extreme conservatism of his students . " I want some ammunition , Grace , " he 'd say , with a twinkle in his eye . " What was that Holmes dissent you mentioned the other day ? " And Grace would smile . " That 's the kind of thing I used to dig up to give to my professors . It seems queer you should want it for your students . Do you suppose they 'll all grow up to be fierce old radicals in their eighties ? " With George and with George alone she could sometimeslaugh . And now she was waiting for him and Pen to pick her up and drive her to the courthouse . She had already had a talk with Julia on the telephone . Damon was closeted with his lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had all warned him about not losing his temper . " We 'll just hope for the best , " she said . " Damonhas nothing to hide . " No , Grace thought , he has nothing to hide , but he has publicly denounced the methods of this committee all over the country . Damon and Julia had been pouring money and time out in defense of their friends and the many unknownscaught up in the general hysteria . Damon was safe in his professorship  --  at least so far  --  and Harvard had made a strong stand . But the committee was sure to bait him , and they must have something in mind , something to spring or they would n't be televising . Grace 's spirits rose as she got into George 's batteredp265old Ford , where she was squeezed in between him and Pen . She felt absurdly young , excited suddenly , a little breathless . " The place will be packed , of course , " George said , stepping on the accelerator . " Goldberg is coming , by the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had the air of a martyr going to the stake . " " Well , he 's been very good , " Pen answered . " Not only dedicating his book to Edward Cavan  --  that took some courage , I expect  --  but the way he 's stood up lately and spoken out . I must say I 'm amazed . " " I 'm not , " George said , " he 's not as cold as he seems  --  and then he told me once that he had refused to be on some committee Edward asked him to be on only two or three days before he died . It seems to have bothered him a good deal . " They had got through the traffic in the Square and were out on the river now , speeding along with the HarvardHouses coming into view and swiftly left behind them ; the bridge where George had stood so long ago with his book alive in his hands sped away . " At least he 's got his book out , which is more than can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciously remembering the sense of clear power he had felt , that power so diffused and scattered now by full-time teaching . Could it have been five years ago ? Where had it all gone ? Pen , seeing his face set , reached over to touch his shoulder . " Next year you 'll have time , George . You really will . " " If I get the fellowship " " Well , Goldberg 's backing you , is n't he ? What more do you want ? "  |p266She  lit a cigarette and handed it to him . The thing was that the coming event had made them all tense , nervous , too aware of all that had happened , lifted out of the day-to-day scramble by this high tension hour . " What time is it ? " Grace asked . She had not been listening . She had been thinking about Edward who had been spared this at least . It was a long time since she had thought about him so vividly . It was a long time since she had cried out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking over and over again in the dark , frightened by her own voice . It was as if Edward as a presence had been swallowedup . Only sometimes late in the evening at a dinner party , perhaps , when the guard was down , his name might be mentioned . He was spoken of then as a wounded man , with just that shade of smugness which the healthy feel for the ill . Only Orlando Fosca had never used this tone , perhaps because he alone felt no guilt . But the others pushed the thought of Edward away , just as she , sitting in the car , pushed it away from her now . " Of course you 'll get the fellowship , " she said , patting George 's knee rather roughly . It was just as well that they had come early . Already , a half hour before the doors were to open , there was quite a crowd gathered outside the courthouse . Grace , lifting her head a little , so she could see , drank in the smoke of battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She recognizedmembers of a militant Catholic organization ; there were shabby old women ; there were students ; there was Goldberg to whom she nodded . She tried to read the faces , to separate those who had come to see " the Reds " baited from those who had come on the side of the accused , to show where they stood , to be heard if possible . But therep267was no way of reading the faces  --  and it seemed strange , the secretiveness , the fact that people could show so little to each other what went on inside them , the fact that this group , patiently waiting , concealed violent passions , fear , fanatical religious zeal , hatred , love . But nothing of this showed . For the moment they were a community of people waiting , united in suspense which , for the moment , was merely physical , waiting for a door to open . Everything changed as soon as a guard pushed back the doors . The passive crowd separated into furious entities pushing each other aside . Grace was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shoved hard against the jamb . In what seemed seconds the courtroom was filled , filled with rumor and the buzz of excitement . Here people would be judged , flanked by the flag of the United States and the state flag , looked down upon from the high place where the judge in a trial case would be sitting ; they would be judged by a group of Senators who made their own rules yet not with any of the usual protections , nor by the usual procedures and they would be judged in front of television cameras . The crew was busily at work now , bringing in standing lights ; every now and then a flashbulb went off , practice or a view of the crowd ? Grace felt suddenly afraid for Damon , afraid for them all . She was actually trembling . She looked sideways at George and saw the pulse in his forehead beating . Then she forgot everything and became nothing but a witness , a witness of whatever was about to happen . It had become a play , in which half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at their mercy . It was all so smooth , the filing in of the chairman of the committee followed by two assistant counsels and someone else whom Grace didp269not recognize . She was struck by the youth of these faces , the untouched look they had ; even the chairman , dressed conservatively , with what she felt was a falsely grave look  --  for in a moment he turned to the young man beside him and made a sotto voce remark which brought smiles to both their faces  --  even he , the Senator himself looked at first glance easy-going , young , quite open as he said scarcely audibly , " The committee will come to order . " He reminded the photographers that they would not be permitted to take pictures while the witnesses were testifying . Where were the witnesses ? Grace realized suddenly that she had not noticed Damon come in , but there he was , sitting at a table his back to her talking to his lawyer , a gray-haired pink-faced man , who seemed quite at ease . The Senator was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He thanked various state officials for their co-operation , advised the Massachusetts State Commission sitting in the jury box on his right that he would be glad to ask the witnessany questions they might wish asked and made it clear that he was at their service . He then turned to the marshal and suggested that he allow as many people as possible into the room , since " this is supposed to be a public hearing . " There was a few moments ' wait while a few more people were squeezed in . Then the doors were closed . Grace did not take her eyes off Damon 's back ; he was very stooped and looked , she thought , tired and old , as he leaned forward talking to his counsel . There was somethingvulnerable about his back , about his thinning hair . He looked so human and frail below the monolithic faces on the judge 's bench that she trembled for him . " Mr. Damon Phillips . " He raised his right hand . " Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so help you God ? " The whole truth , Grace thought . Who can know the whole truth ? Who can promise to tell that ? " I do , " Damon said in a loud firm voice . Of course , Grace thought , as the interminable formalities began , this will take hours . She felt wildly impatient and began to doodle frantically on an envelope , while the counsel 's name and address were recorded , while the Senator reminded the photographers again that they would not be allowed to take pictures during the hearing . Then he leaned forward , after shuffling through a sheaf of papers handed to him by the young man on his right , and began his questioning . Damon had to spell his own name , explain his position at Harvard , that he had been a professor some fifteen years , that before that he had been an associate professor for five years , that his field was physics , that his salary was twelve thousand dollars , that during the war he had for a time worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Phillips , in nineteen forty-three and nineteen forty-four , when you were working for the government of the United States is it a fact that you were active in the Harvard Teachers ' Union ? " " That is true , " Damon said patiently . " Your salary was at that time ten thousand dollars . I take it that you did not join this union with the idea of striking for more pay ? " There was a ripple of laughter in the audience.  | " I did not join it , Mr. Chairman . I was one of its originalfounders , and the union was founded in nineteen thirty-five . " " What exactly was its purpose , Mr. Phillips ? " The chairman leaned benignly toward the witness and seemed all attention . Actually Grace felt that he was not interested at all and that all this was building up toward a point which was the real point . The answers did not matter . The questionsthemselves would lead inevitably to a trap . But Damon was seizing the opportunity with both hands . He launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Harvard professors had felt that they were too detached from the community . The union was an affiliate of the AFL and through this affiliationthey not only came to know the problems of highschoolteachers in the community , but also could take action on issues in local government and even in state government . Damon gave as an example the stand the Teachers ' Union took at a time when the President of Harvard was openly coming out against child-labor laws , which they had supported . " If I am right you also actively supported the Communistgovernment in Spain during the Spanish Civil War ? " the chairman asked , rather impatiently . " We supported the duly elected Republican government of Spain against a fascist minority who were out to capture it by force , yes . " His answer shot back . There was a faint booing at the back of the hall and scattered applause , in which Grace joined fervently . Damon was doing a little too well , Grace realized . He had taken the bit between his teeth and was galloping off . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are aware that the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee is on the Attorney General 's list , I presume ? That it has been publicly named subversive , that it was subversive in nineteen forty-one , in October of nineteen forty-one ? " " I am aware of that . " The chairman leaned over to his counsel and was handed a canceled check . " I have in my hand a check for twenty-five dollars made payable to the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee , and signed in your name . I will hand you this check and ask you if you have seen this check before . " " Obviously , since it is signed by my name . " " It is dated October eighth , nineteen forty-one . At that time it was publicly known that this was a subversive organization . You were aware of that fact ? " " Yes . " " Do you know what the word subversive ' means , Mr. Phillips ? " " I think so . " " You think so ? You a professor at Harvard , engaged during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what subversive ' means ? Perhaps I had better inform you , so that you may not only think but know , Mr. Phillips . The Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee was according to the Attorney General 's Report , a CommunistFront organization . Did you think ' so in nineteen fortyonewhen you made out a check for twenty-five dollars ? " " Yes . " " Are you a member of the Communist Party , Mr. Phillips ? " No- " Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party ? " " No . " Yet in nineteen forty-one you were giving them active support , giving them money . " The chairman looked quite grieved . " Are you professors just dumb or what ? " Damon pulled his eyebrow and his face flushed . " This was a matter of conscience , " he said with a troubled look which Grace felt would do him no good . " Your conscience told you you should support the Communist Party ? " " As far as I knew the money collected by the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans wounded in the war were being taken care of . Some of the money may have been going to other things of which I do not know . I did know about the hospital and wanted to support it . " " You thought that your judgment was superior to that of the Attorney General of the United States ? " Damon bowed his head . He swallowed twice . " Shall I repeat the question ? " " I suppose the answer is yes in this case . " Damon cast a worried look at his counsel . " As a member of the Harvard University faculty you no doubt consider yourself a man of superior intelligence , superior it would seem even to the government of the United States . This is very interesting . Let us take a hypotheticalcase . Suppose this government had been at war with a government of which you approved , a Communistrungovernment , and suppose your conscience told you that your own government was in the wrong , would you feel free to give secret information to the enemy ? "  |p273Damon  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said very quietly , " In time of war I would consider it my duty to support the government of the United States . " " But not in time of peace ? " The Senator leaned forwardblandly . Someone laughed . There was a hostile stir from one section of the courtroom . For a second Grace had the vision of the hundreds and thousands of American faces sitting in parlors and kitchens watching Damon 's haunted look as he glanced backward at the crowd , as he again ran his fingers through his hair . Then she was distracted because she had suddenly noticed Julia for the first time , down near the front , sitting very erect , her eyes never leaving Damon . When Grace came to , she heard the chairman ask . " Did you know a Harvard professor called Edward Cavan ? " George Hastings put a hand gently on Grace 's arm , for at Edward 's name she had jerked to attention , half rising out of her seat . They could feel the tension in Damon , could see him catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Edward Cavan was my very good friend . " There was absolute stillness in the courtroom . " A very interesting statement , Professor . Let me remind you of some of the pertinent facts about this very good friend of yours . " The Senator lifted a paper from those in front of him and read , " He was a member of the Socialist Party as early as nineteen twenty-nine ; he was active on a committee for the defense of the Communist , Harry Bridges ; he campaigned for the Communists in Spain ; he spent the winter of nineteen forty-seven in Prague andp274came back to write several articles analyzing the situation there and praising the Socialist government for its toleranceof Communists ; he supported Wallace and campaignedfor him in nineteen forty-eight ; he did not leave the Progressive Party after it had been exposed as a CommunistFront . " These facts were read slowly and matter-offactly . Now the Senator lifted his eyes and raised his voice a fraction . " Edward Cavan committed suicide in October of nineteen forty-nine . " There was a slight pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are true ? " " Yes . " Oh , Damon , Grace thought and it was like a prayer , poor Damon . Would he be forced now to deny Edward ? She felt a dreadful impulse to get up and run away . It was too painful . " Just what was the bond between you , a professor of physics and Edward Cavan , a professor of American literatureand an avowed supporter of communism , Mr. Phillips ? " The chairman was smiling slightly , a superior smile , a patient smile , as if to say , you can have all the time you want , you know , to walk into my trap . So Grace interpreted his look . Just then George leaned over and whispered to her , " Do n't worry . " Damon coughed , took out a handkerchief to wipe his mouth . He hesitated for what seemed a long time , then said as if he were weighing each word , " Our bond was that we both believed that being a professor , whatever one 's subject , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chairman leaned back comfortably , " And you in/terpreted the responsibilities of citizenship  --  I presume you mean as citizens of the United States  --  " This sally was greeted by a guffaw from back in the audience , and general giggles . It was all Grace could do to keep from shouting , " Foul play . " The chairman proceeded " that you interpreted these responsibilities as meaningsupport of the Communist Party , " here he raised his eyes and looked out at the audience , hammering the point with one hand , " a secret subversive party dedicated to the overthrow of the government to which you say you felt responsible . I must say that for such brilliant minds , your reasoning must appear peculiar to say the least to the average loyal American . " Then he turned quite paternally , it seemed , to the witness . " Your close friend , Edward Cavan , seems to have admitted that he had been hopelessly wrong . " Grace clasped the arms of her chair with her hands . She was suddenly furiously angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid a restraining hand on her . " It wo n't do any good , " lie whispered . " You must n't . " " You have had five years to reconsider your own position . " The chairman leaned forward and spoke quite confidentially , " Have you come to any conclusions which might be of help to this committee , Mr. Phillips ? " Without a second 's pause I ) anion shot back , his shoulderssquared . " I have cnnie to some conclusions . They would not be of help to this committee . " He 's getting angry , Grace thought . Oh dear , that may be the worst thing . Yet in her heart she was glad . The chairman showed no consciousness of the change of tone . " When we have ( Limning evidence against an iii/dividual in a position to influence and indoctrinate the young , we must be given proof of good faith . In your association with Edward Cavan over the years , as a founder of the Teachers ' Union especially , you admit to having worked closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what your conclusions are , Professor "  --  herethe chairman smiled discreetly  --  " but I have here a series of names . The committee will be grateful if you show your good faith by telling us what you know about Paul Humber . " The trap , Grace thought , is sprung . After the long preliminaries , she felt almost relieved . All eyes were focusednow on Damon . " May I confer with my counsel ? " " You may . " Damon and his counsel conferred for a few seconds . " May I be permitted to make a statement , sir ? " " A witness may make a statement provided it has been handed in to this committee twenty-four hours before the hearing . " The chairman leaned over to his counsel and whispered something . " May I confer with my counsel ? " Damon asked . " You may . " There was complete silence in the courtroom , silence and attention . The chairman tapped with his pencil a moment , then yawned , and leaned back in his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea that Edward Cavan 's name would come up today . My statement has to do with the conclusions you asked for some moments ago . " The chairman leaned forward on the bench and said categorically , " You may make your statement when you have answered my question . Was Paul Humber a memberp277of the Communist Party at any period during the time that you knew him ? " " I am sorry , Senator , I shall have to refuse to answer that question on the grounds of conscience . " There was a slight edge in the chairman 's voice now and he spoke quite slowly . " Your conscience had led you before , by your own admission , into rather curious paths . It permitted you some time back to give money to a Communistorganization against the express advice of the AttorneyGeneral . I 'm afraid I shall have to order you to answer the question . " Damon leaned forward for a second to catch his counsel'seye , then stood up again . " I am sorry , sir . I have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former friends . " Grace gave a loud sigh . She was sitting up very straight now , her head high and she whispered , " Bravo , Damon , " so loudly that several people turned round to stare at her . The chairman was not smiling now . He looked very grave . " You are saying in effect that you put friendship above the security of the United States ? " " I am not willing to give the names of former associateswho were not to my knowledge engaged in any criminalactivity . " " Have the record show that the witness is ordered to answer the question and persists in his refusal . There is , as you perhaps remember , such a thing as contempt of Congress , Mr. Phillips . " " Disgusting , " Grace said loudly . Something in the way she said it or in her appearance released the tension and the courtroom rocked with laughter . The chairman frowned . " If there is any more disturbance of this sort , " he saidp278coldly , " we shall have to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marshal which clearly suggested removing Grace if necessary . " Sir , " it was Damon again , quite unruffled . He actually had one hand in his pocket , and Grace guessed that he felt relieved that at last they had come to open war . " Sir , may I make a statement , the one I asked to make some time ago ? " " I ask the questions here , Professor . You answer them , " the chairman said shortly . Then he leaned over to counsel and after a whispered conference , looked up . " Very well , you have a statement ? Make it . " Damon took a deep breath . He spoke now very slowly as if he were weighing each word , but he spoke very distinctlyas if he were anxious that the entire courtroom could hear . " You asked me whether I had come to any conclusions in the years since the suicide of my friend , Edward Cavan . " There was a ripple of interest in the crowd , then absolute silence as all strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , it was as if the people assembled in the courtroom sensed that this was a crucial moment for him . Many leaned forward . Grace sat up as straight as she could , though she could not stop her chin from trembling . For some reason what flashed through her mind was Orlando 's saying " We shall not know for a long time about Edward . " Damon coughed that slightly nervous cough she recognized as meaning he was feeling something deeply . For a second he half-turned and caught Julia 's eye or looked for it obviously . " I have come to the conclusion , " he said , for a second facing the courtroom and then turning back to the chairman of the committee , " that although Edward Cavan may have been wrong in his belief that Communists andp279Socialists could and should work together , in the essence of his belief he was right and many of us were wrong . " Again he paused , before speaking more quickly and with a certain thrust . " That belief was that the intellectual unist stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such times as these when that frontier is being narrowed down every day . He feared  --  and we know how rightly , " said Damon , his voice suddenly trembling , " the increasing apathy and retreat of the American people before such encroachments of fundamental civil rights as are representedby this committee . " He said the last words loudly and slowly , looking the chairman full in the face . They were greeted by an uproar in the audience . It was as if the long tense attention had to burst out now , as if a match had been set to a bonfire and the whole room blazed with emotion . From one section of the room there were boos and groans , and when Grace heard this she stood up and began shouting she did not know what , rage and enthusiasm mixed in incoherent passionate words . Some people applauded her ; others turned to stare at her ; a few shouted back , but now she was on her feet , caught up in a wave of excitement , nothing could stop her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she shouted . " We have to defend the Republic as that brave man did .... " She had pushed George roughly aside , but now a guard reached the aisle and she felt a hand over her mouth . Beforeshe knew what was really happening , she had been hauled out of her chair and was being forcibly though gently pushed through the crowd , some of whom watched passively , fascinated , no doubt , by the sight of this man lifting an old lady out by main force . She did not struggle , she was too surprised . The chairman was pounding withp280his gavel as she called back , " You ca n't do this , " just before the doors closed behind her . Then she , George and Pen found themselves outside , closely followed by the cameramenwho had got some action at last . She was panting so much with exertion and emotion that for a moment she could n't speak , pinning back her pin which had come undone , pulling her hat back into shape . " Dirty disgusting business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was dead white . Pen looked as if she might be going to cry . " I did n't know Damon had it in him . " " Well "  --  Grace surveyed them in the flush of her triumph  --  " there'sone courageous man left anyway . Edward would have been proud . We can hold up our heads again  --  at last . " " We 'd better get out of here . " George was suddenly aware of the circle of grinning faces around them , cameras pointed . " Your name , please ? " one of them asked Grace , notebook ready . " It 's none of your damned business . " George made a dive for the camera and missed it . " I 'm glad to give my name . Grace Kimlock is my name , " Grace said clearly and with perfect dignity . " You can say if you will that the liberals are n't dead yet . " Did anyone but herself get the nuance in this ? It was the accolade to Damon , the first time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulatory sense . Then she added , with a kind of bravado , her chin lifted , her eyes twinkling , " I have n't been put out of a courtroom since the SaccoVanzetticase . " " Your age , Miss Kimlock ? " " Seventy-five . "  | " Quite a girl , " one of the men said , and they all laughed . " Shut up , you dirty bastard . " George would have knocked him down , except for Pen 's intervention . " Come along , you two . We 're making an exhibition of ourselves , " she said firmly . " He 'll be cited for contempt , of course , " George said when they were safely in the car , lighting cigarettes . Grace , feeling the reaction , was shaking all over and wondered if the children noticed . For them , she knew , it could not be such a moment as it had been for her . " What does that matter ? " she said , " we can hold our heads up . " After they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , Pen said thoughtfully , " It 's only the beginning , of course . " " Yes , but it has looked like the end for so long , " Grace answered quickly . " You see . " " What I liked "  --  and George smiled as he said it , a sudden young happy smile  --  " was that it was Edward Cavan 's name that really got Damon going . And it might have been disastrous ; I was scared there for a while " " Damon Phillips has guts , " Pen broke in . Grace looked at the river and her eyes were shining with tears . " I think more , he 's generous . It 's a liberal trait , " she added , but only she knew what a handsome apology it was.
