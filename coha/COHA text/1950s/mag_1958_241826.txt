On the bandstand , Trumpeter Miles Davis resembles a man who wandered in off the street for a nightcap and decided to stick around for a few licks on a borrowed horn . He will noodle his way through a solo , turn to chat with another player , stroll to a nearby table for a drag on a cigarette . But the relaxed air is deceptive . Davis pays scrupulous attention to the group and individual sounds of his combo , often lies awake nights rehearsing new arrangements in his head . <P> Back in 1948 , when everybody was trying to blow like Diz , Davis ' nine-man pickup band was trimming Gillespie 's blast-furnace sound to a clean , low Bunsen flame . The eight sides the group cut in 1949 did as much as anything else to usher in small-group " chamber " jazz . They also stuck Trumpeter Davis with an adjective he distrusts- " cool . " Last week , uncool as ever , Davis was at Manhattan 's Birdland , spinning out the alternately jagged and limber melodic lines that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowers . <P> Fast &; Light .

Growing up in East St. Louis , Ill. , he learned the trumpet from a local instructor who had played with Bobby Hackett and Hal Baker . " ' Play without any vibrato , ' he used to tell us . ' You 're gon na get old anyway and start shaking . ' That 's how I tried to play-fast and light and no vibrato . " For a time , when he was in his teens , Miles tried to play like Harry James ( " I like to break out all my front teeth " ) . Then Billy Eckstine 's band came through St. Louis , and Miles met Charlie Parker and Gillespie , sat in with them occasionally . He put in a stint at Manhattan 's Juilliard School of Music , broke into the professional big time as trumpeter with Parker 's band . He was one of the trumpet powers of bop when he organized his own nine-man combo in 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and Arranger Gil Evans . " That sound we got , " he says , " came originally from Ellington . Gil loved Duke so much some of it rubbed off . " <P> With a brass section augmented by a French horn and tuba , Davis &; Co. ( including such rising soloists as Trombonist Kai Winding , Alto Saxophonist Lee Konitz , Pianist John Lewis ) worked out a series of subtle , low-toned arrangements - Budo , Jeru , Rouge-that helped turn many young instrumentalists from bop . <P> Old &; New . At Birdland last week , Davis would shove his muted horn into the mike for a sparely ornamented , loosely swinging commentary on All of You , or sigh out a breathy , blues-flavored , open-horn version of Thelonius Monk 's ' Round Midnight , or whip through Charlie Parker 's Ah-Leu-Cha with the dry , stuttering sound that inspired one observer to compare him to a man walking on eggshells . He is at his best in such a ballad as My Ship , which moves him to serene , spare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
