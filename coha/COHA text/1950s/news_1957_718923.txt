txt The Administration is preparing to curtail sharply  --  if not end altogether ? Federal aid to slum clearance and other direct housing assistance . No final decisions have been made , but the preliminaries are under way . " The Administration is looking for ways to cut down Federal participation in some of these programs , " concedes a top-level Federal housing official . Last week the Housing and Home Finance Agency completed the first stages of a comprehensive study to determine how this can be done . Federal Housing Administrator Cole now faces the task of deciding what recommendations to make to the White House . This reappraisal of the Government 's role in housing fits into an over-all Administration attempt to hold the line on Federal spending in the budget the President will send to Congress next January . Budget men are starting work on the fiscal 1959 budget now , ? and they want-to keep spending at the $71.8 billion level projected for the fiscal year beginning July 1 ? if not actually reduce it .

A tip-oft to the Administration 's new line of thinking on low-income housing aids came earlier this month when Mr. Cole hinted strongly that the Government would lessen its role in this field . He told a national housing conference here : " Private industry must accept responsibility in this field and demonstrate its willingness as well as its ability to serve some of this need ; public housing officials must be willing to alter patterns that were established 20 years ago and make them apply to the broader prob . lems we face today . " The Administration decided earlier this spring to cut back its request for slum clear untie appropriations from Congress for the coming fiscal year to $175 million from $250 million . This reduction was later dropped because of adverse Congressional reaction , but the intent was clear . Actual Outlay Relatively Small Actual budget expenditures for the shun clearance and public housing programs ate relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Iwo programs combined can for only about $100 million of actual outlays . But the nature of the slum clearance program , especially , is for spending to increase sharply as more communities become eligible for aid in future years , This rapid later  --  year increase is what the Administration wants to at least slow down . The thinking is that by holding down new money requests in the fiscal 1359 ' budget , spending increases could be avoided in later years . Chief support for tightening up on spending for housing comes from the Treasury and the Budget Bureau . Both are primarily concerned with checking the rise in Federal spending that has drawn so much criticism during the current session of Congress , Mr. Cole and other housing officials are somewhat more iieluctant to scrap their housing programs in the interest of over-all budget policy . The battle promises to grow hotter between now and next January . " If you think we 're going to end the slum clearance program altogether , " says one housing official , " you 're wrong .
