txt Twenty-five hundred Hyde Park residents crowded into Mandel hall on the University of Chicago campus and overflowed into the corridors last night to hear Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton of the university read an indictment of law enforcement in the area and to approve enthusiastically the organization of a South East Chicago commission to do something about it . The audience approved the nomination of 60 provisional members of a board of directors for the organization , which will have its headquarters in the Hyde Park Y. M. C. A. The provisional members will meet there May 28 to elect 15 additional members and then to select from among their number a 15 man executive committee . Chancellor Kimpton pledged $55,000 of the university 's money to the project if an equal sum is raised by the rest of the community . He was frequently cheered as he read a report of a committee of five civic leaders appointed last March to draft a plan to combat the rising tide of lawlessness and civic decay in the Oakland , Kenwood , Hyde Park , and Woodlawn areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anyone tries to interfere with the operation of the commission n d its work , we 'll raise hell . " Other Speakers Heard Other speakers included Police Capt . Albert Anderson of the Hyde Park station , Ald. Merriam 15thl , and Edgar G. Brown , head of the National Negro congress and Republican candidate for congress from the 1st district . " It does me good to knuw the people of this community can get together and do a good job as you are doing , ' Capt . Anderson told the group . " I did not ask for this assignment , and no doubt I wo n't like it , but I accept the challenge . I will do everything in my power ' to bring law and order back to , the Hyde Park community . " He outlined the problems of the police department , Doting that ' policemen , working six days a week , receive less pay than mailmen , motormen , or street cleaners . He said the morale of the department is low . Merriam Urges Action Aid . Merriam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city took the position that they are going to do something and not just say why they ca n't do something . " He said that despite the approval of an 58,000,000 bond issue for new street lights last year , he has been informed that Hyde Park will get no new lights until 1953 , Brown objected to confining the crusade to the Hyde Park area , calling it a city-wide problem and adding , " All you will do is chase the criminals into other districts . " Kimpton replied that while the committee realized the problem is city-wide and will be willing to cooperate with similar groups elsewhere , its principal concern is with conditions in Hyde Park . " The university has a deep interest and a tremendous stake in our community , " he said . " We are here to stay and we are dedicated to the kind of community that Is appropriate for the families of our faculty members and for our students to live in . " The committee 's analysis of the community 's ills led , in several instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city hall . " The city administration in many departments is inefficient , dominated by self-serving political influences , and lacks over-all positive leadership , " the report declared . Chief target of criticism was the police department . It was described as undermanned , inefficient , inadequately trained and supervised , and archaically administered . " Too Many Dishonest " " The morale and morals of the police force are bad , " the report said . " The majority of the city 's policemen are honest , but there are too many dishonest men on the force and the department has no effective procedure for discovering and eliminating them . " In many instances , tizens ' complaints of police irregurarities , such as invitations to bribe , have resulted in reprisals against the complainant rather than disciplinary action against the dishonest policeman . " The report also assailed the inspection services of the city . " Enforcement of zoning and health and safety ordinances as well as the building code is inadequate and corrupt , " it said . " Illegal conversions dividing big old dwellings into numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . " Street Lighting Poor Street lighting in the area , the committee asserted , is old and inadequate . Breakdowns are frequent and there are no repair crews on duty after midnight . Earlier in the day Ald. Cohen 4th had made a plea for better street lighting in the community at a meeting of the city council finance committee . No action was taken on his request for funds to improve street lights in the district . Chancellor Iiimpton conceded that in the last few weeks the Hyde Park community has been well policed . The improvement resulted , he said , from the pressure brought by a mass meeting sponsored by the Hyde Park Community council last March . Spurred by Abduction Police also were spurred by the abduction of Mrs. Joan Untermyer , 30 , wife of an Argonne national laboratory scientist , who was dragged from her bed by a Negro burglar last May 11 . She later was released unharmed , " One can actually see patrolmen on duty en the streets both day and night , and cruising patrol cars , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby ones have been cleaned up . In gangland terminology , the heat has been on . This much was very definitely accomplished by our last mass meeting and subsequent activities . " The only way to keep the " heat on " is to continue and intensify civic interest in these matters , said Kimpton . Willing to Put Up $15,000 The committee predicted that the community would provide adequate financial support for the new organization . Chancellor Kimpton said the university would Provide $15,000 immediately if an equal sum was pledged by the community . He also said the university would pledge $10,000 a year for four years . " We like this community , " the committee report concluded . " We believe in it . If it were n't good we would n't be fighting for it . With the help of all of you , we shall keep our community the finest residential and business area in the city of Chicago . " Other members of the committee are Rabbi Louis L.
