As a historian turned publisher , Earle W. Newton likes to be told he ca n't do something . Two years ago , he sounded out other publishers on his idea for a magazine to rescue U.S. history from classroom dullness , dramatize it in an illustrated quarterly with at least 16 pages of color . The experts warned him that he could n't possibly start such a magazine with less than $100,000 . Anyway , it would have too limited a market to pay off . Newton raised $2,000 from fellow historians , and went ahead . <P> Last week 34-year-old Publisher Newton not only had his original $2,000 back , with the ninth issue of his American Heritage , he also had 10,000 readers . And he had convinced the professionals . Curtis Publishing Co. ' s distributing subsidiary this week will launch a national circulation drive for American Heritage , the first quarterly it has ever agreed to handle . With the big direct-mail campaign , Publisher Newton hopes to win enough new readers to go bimonthly , trim his price from the current 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time Earle Newton has turned a shoestring into a magazine . A graduate of Amherst , where he founded its literary magazine , Touchstone , he served as a Navy historian in World War II , then went back to his job running Vermont 's Historical Society . He decided to start a magazine devoted to regional , grass-roots history , try to make it as readable as a good newspaper . The state put up $5,000 to start Newton 's quarterly Vermont Life . Fearfully , Newton ordered 11,000 copies for the first issue ; it sold out in three days . So did the second issue of 20,000 , the third of 25,000 . Circulation now tops 50,000 . He went on to write a state history , The Vermont Story , with liberal excerpts from Vermont Life . <P> In his American Heritage , Newton uses the same newsy editorial approach and format he uses in Vermont Life . He still sticks to regional history , but his regions are selected from all over the U.S. Well on his way toward making the past as readable as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between things ( Conestoga wagons , railroads , the American eagle ) , places and people ( Garfield 's assassin , Lincoln as a horse tamer ) , and events ( Tippecanoe , the Bear Flag revolt ) . Newton , who is also a director of Massachusetts ' famed Old Sturbridge Village ( TIME , Nov. 5 ) , puts out the magazine in his spare time with the help of only one paid hand . He wangles free manuscripts from members of the American Association for State and Local History , his chief backer , and name writers , e.g. , Carl Carmer , Roger Butterfield , who are also interested in livening up history . Editor Newton 's biggest problem is to get his scholarly contributors to write a colorful style instead of " plodding into the facts and proceeding in dull and orderly fashion to the conclusion " and to get the articles in on time . " But when you do n't pay , " sighs Newton , " you ca n't be arbitrary about deadlines . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
