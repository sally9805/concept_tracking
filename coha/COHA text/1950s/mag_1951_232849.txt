The professor of journalism finally wore down the Boston Herald . As a onetime reporter , editor and news analyst , Boston University 's Dr. David Manning White is allergic to newspaper cliches and " fog words " ( i.e. , seldom-used words ) , has been needling Boston papers about their use of them . Last week the Herald waved the white flag , editorialized : " In view of the Professor 's unfortunate expos of Boston newspaper punditing , we have little alternative but to follow his advice . . . " <P> <P> Henceforth , the Herald would strive for simple phrasing . <P> Three days later it backslid , ran the headline : HEARINGS STRESS ACHESON UBIQUITY . Professor White , 33 , spotted " ubiquity " as one of the thickest fog words , made a bet with John Crider , the Herald 's chief editorial writer , that few readers knew what it meant . To prove it , White stood in front of the Boston Public Library and polled 72 passersby . His findings : only 19.4% correctly thought that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by association with the name " Acheson " ) that it referred to " errors . " <P> Confusion . White began making his collection of fog words last spring , by picking 25 sentences from New York and Boston newspapers . Sample sentence : " He has marshaled his oft-reiterated and unproved allegations to obfuscate and postpone decisions . " White asked some 200 students and parents whether obfuscate meant reverse , change , confuse or rearrange . Only 23 knew it meant confuse Results were similar for such standbys as plebiscite , inculcate , anomaly , shibboleth , indigenous , cataclysms , aggrandizement tantamount , statutory , encroachment , implementation and peripheral . <P> Such words , said White , are not used often enough in ordinary conversation for the average newspaper reader to know what they mean . For example , obfuscate is not likely to show up once in 4,000,000 words of ordinary speaking and writing ( according to the Lorge-Thorndike Teacher 's Word Book of 3,000 Words ' ) . If newspapers would forget the elegant variation , * and use the simple word " confuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers would understand them better . <P> Dereliction of Duty . White also clipped 20 examples of newspaper clichs and standard phrases out of six Boston papers , sent his journalism students through a night bakery , a waiting room , a steel mill and a railroad station , to see how well the phrases were understood . Samples : bipartisan foreign policy , act of overt aggression , fusillade of shots , dereliction of duty , titular head of the party , diplomat without portfolio , deficit spending , eschewing presidential ambitions , policy of containment . The average reader got nearly half the phrases wrong . Even " bipartisan foreign policy " had hard going ; some of those questioned thought it meant that both Roman Catholics and Protestants should be employed in the State Department .
