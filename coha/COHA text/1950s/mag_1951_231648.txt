The best Finance Minister Cuba ever had resigned last week . Jos ( " Pepin " ) Bosch , 54 , Lehigh-educated millionaire businessman ( Bacardi rum and Hatuey beer ) , had entered the cabinet of President Carlos Prio , his old friend from revolutionary days , in order to help the government out of the fiscal red . He did the job in 14 prodigious months . <P> When Finance Minister Bosch took office , there was a deficit of $18 million ; as he stepped out , Cuba had its largest surplus on record - more than $15 million . The secret of Bosch 's success was uncommon ministerial honesty and unswerving drive to collect taxes uncollected by lax predecessors . " Everyone will pay , " he announced , " without exception or privilege . I 'll send them bills . " <P> Back to the Black . Knowing most Cuban industrialists by their first names , and aware almost to the peso of what they should be paying , Bosch upped income-tax collections from $6 to $25 million , business-profit tax revenues from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own family paid up back taxes . The President himself told the story of an industrialist who went to the Treasury to try to get off paying $18,000 in profit taxes , wound up paying $120,000 , then " went around telling everyone that at last there was a man in Treasury who would n't let him get away with anything . " <P> Bosch tidied up corruption in the customs service . Finding hundreds of businesses operating without licenses , he made them pay the official fees . Throwing out a racket whereby contractors were never paid till they had kicked back 30% , he squared accounts , began paying-as-you-go . <P> Such a Finance Minister was poison to politicos . Bosch all but stopped the gravy train that had shuttled in &; out of the Treasury since the republic 's birth. *Outraged Congressmen got up all kinds of investigating committees to harry him . They quizzed him in practically every field of government finance , sometimes till 3 in the morning . A fortnight ago they summoned him for more heckling on his plan for reorganizing a rundown government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a previous engagement , went off to a Bacardi board meeting at which he was elected company president . <P> Back to Kickbacks ? Bosch said last week that he was leaving public office on doctor 's orders . Undoubtedly , he was fed up with politicos . He had done the job he had been asked to do , but he realized that as the 1952 presidential campaign drew nearer , pressure would grow to finance the government campaign out of the Treasury , as it was financed more or less in 1948 . Said Havana 's newspaper Alerta : " Bosch took office to the profound disgust of the politicians , and leaves accompanied by their broad smiles as they wait outside the ministry doors to assault the Treasury he guarded . " <P> <P> *The late Senator Jos Alemn , President Grau 's Education Minister from 1946 to 1948 , is acknowledged to have been the most skillful engineer ever to operate on this run . Asked how he got " all that money " out of the Treasury , he is said to have replied : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
