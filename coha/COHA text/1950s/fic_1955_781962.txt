 | awful things sometimes . I know . It 's just like a wildness inside you and you do n't mean it but it 's done anyways . I do n't blame you . And I felt a little twinge of something strange , a whisper of anger , that she had done it for me , made grace with herself in my behalf and I could claim no pride in having begged it . I tried to remember what it was Aunt Sarah had asked me to ask her about God but it would not come to me and it seemed after a moment 's reflection that it was none of His affair ; that this was between us because God had never known the terror of strangers . It does n't matter about the letter , she said , her eyes black and grave as deep water . Because I mind what it was about  --  I can think of nearly every word of it by rote . I glanced at her aunt but she seemed heedless of me there and I stared at her big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand large with chores , knuckles rootlike with a thousand washdays and stained with pickle spice and bluing , dyed fast against the erosion of all time , the gaunt simple gold ring pressed deep into the flesh of her finger  --  speckled with liver marks . She rocked gently in the yellow morning window light with her eyes veiled with her fingers and hummed an old tune against the silence . I wish we could be friends , Cathie said softly . I do n't mean I would expect you to treat me like I was a sister or anything like that . I mean just good friends . All right , I said , and thought of the cap full of my treasures that had been too preposterous and dirty to bring her there , and they were , after all , things that she would not want anyhow . Yet I glanced toward the doorway and saw that Aunt Sarah had gone downstairs again and I thought I would risk it . Wait a minute , I said . I brought some truck . And I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes began to shine with curiosity and then I dumped the contents on the quilt . What are they ? Treasures , I said . This feather ? . And I held it up and it moved faintly in the still air of the small room . It 's a hawk 's feather . Ah ! Is it real ? Genuine , I said . I was down in the meadow below the orchard one fall afternoon . I saw the hawk swoop and take one of Uncle Joe 's  | Dominick Roosters and before the critter could take wing again old Junius had him by the throat  --  that 's the blue tick that died  --  had him and shook him till the blood drops splattered on the whitewash on the barn door and  --  and afterwards I found this feather in the dust and I know it was his and not the Dominick 's  --  a genuine hawk feather . And here  --  a real marble  --  an agate ! And these are bird points ! And I went on in eager catalog of each of these wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incontinent and stupid owl and she marveled before each one and insisted on hearing its story and put each carefully back in the cap again and tucked it under her quilt and thanked me solemnly . I seen the boat , I whispered , with the image of it suddenly there before my eyes again . The Nellie Queen ? she whispered with a wild , quick breath . Is n't she beautiful ? Yes , I said . She 's Abijah 's boat , she said , her eyes on the ceiling in a dream I could never share . He went to Jeffersonville and gave Mister I toward the plans and stood by and watched every white-oak plank from keel to stack . He even made Mister Howard send all the way to Steubenville for the paint because he said the paint he had was n't white enough . And did you notice the doors on the cabins ? Gold leaf ! Real beaten gold leaf ! And that painting on the texas  --  that cost fifty dollars and was done by hand by a genuine artist  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cathie ? crowed the old woman suddenly and the pace of the rockers ceased . She rose and came toward the bed and laid the big goldbanded hand across the child 's forehead . My goodness ! You ' pear to be mighty nigh well , Cathie Ellen ! Hello , Thomas ! Hello . She stood looking at me , without anger , without rancor , as if she did not remember at all that it had been me that had done it , her eyes patient and tired and disremembering as if they had grown that way from looking down at children a long while . My , Thomas , the way you favor your mother is a caution ! Especially around the eyes ! I knowed Tom 's mother , Catherine Ellen ! Yes , I did ! And she was a fair , fine lady  --  as Christian a woman as ever walked this earth !  | Thomas and me are friends , said Cathie . Why , sure ! said the old woman , and I saw suddenly a strange thing about her face : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead seemed fixed eternally in perplexity . Sure ! she said . Two little lambs in the world together ! Both motherless ! And why should n't you be friends ! The Lord meant that to be ! Yes , He did ! She cast me a little sidelong glance of tender alarm , as if she might wound me by sending me away and then she said softly that she thought Catherine Ellen had better sleep , and when we looked her eyes were already closed . Thomas ? And I turned and saw Aunt Sarah in the doorway with a saucepan in her hand and she beckoned to me . Did you do as I told you ? Oh , what ? Did you ask that little girl 's forgiveness ? Yes . Did you ask God to forgive you ? Through her pardon ? I  --  I could n't remember exactly ! And do you think He will bother if you do n't show the slightest concern whether He cares or not ? No . He might ? . He might nothing . God does n't come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll say no more though . You 've been spared , I might add , and it 's only because God cared about her  --  not about your poor , sinful soul ! She will live . The fever passed its crisis this morning at sunup . No thanks to you though , my proud , fine peacock ! And she marched off with the saucepan in her hand like the scepter of some queen of vengeance and I was alone with whispers and timebrowned shadows and the drip of icicles outside the door as the sun thawed the ice-bound house . I was alone and I was afraid again and I harked to the paced creak of her aunt 's rocker and went to the room of my Grandfather and wondered if one should knock when there was really no one there . Because there was no one there . There never was . And the room smelled the same and looked the same ; it would never change ; when doom clapped its iron hands some night to beckon us all to gather for judgment from its cloud over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space , though the house itself perished and went to dust and blew off down the river road with the leaves of fall ; that room would always be there with my Grandfather 's  | watch ticking like the heart of a bleak , white-bearded God . I stood in the little room and saw the sun , yellow-rayed among the spinning dust motes by his chair , motley in the wadded rag rug my grandmother 's hands had knotted and shaped in a time before me , and for the life of me I could not remember . I had forgotten it again : what she had told me to tell Him . She survived . But I think in that winter week someone in both of us died . She rose at last from the quilts , healed and pale as a mushroom ; her dark eyes burning the more in the round livid mask of innocent , inscrutable girlhood . For a few days she sat alone in the rocker by the window in the little , gasping , cold room , with a shawl around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Abijah 's seal again that winter ; she had hidden it where God Himself could not have found it , somewhere in a crack or cranny of the little room , I suspect . As for myself , my heart and mind were in a riot of disorder . Aunt Sarah watched like a barn owl for the smallest mouse of meanness in me and I think by that time there was no reason for her to watch . Cathie had won every battle . And by now I was too frightened even to lift my voice to her , lest the high listener in his room should hear . Sometimes in those weeks when the winter seemed weary of itself and waited with an eagerness , like someone old , for the spring which is its death , I would chance upon her somewhere in the house staring at something of mine : the blackamoor doll that she had handled that first day or an old top  --  or my ice skates . Sometimes she would stand for long moments , a finger in her lips , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stand there knowing she knew I was watching and I would wish she would touch it , or pick it up or even break it and not because I would be angry at her for this but because it might be a chance for me to forgive her something . Once when I had surprised her standing by the sideboard in the dining room staring at the blackamoor toy she had suddenly lifted her eyes to my spying face in the stained , time-smoked mirror in the peeling , gold-leaf oval and given me back eye-for-eye for a long minute and then faded away into the sea-gloom of the hall and was gone . As for my capful of treasures I could never find a trace of them and I knew she had hidden them away in the same cache with Abijah 's brown wax seal .  | One cold March afternoon Uncle Joe fetched his musty greatcoat from the hall antler and went off up the frozen road to Carly Juniper 's store to buy the snuff that Aunt Sarah had refused him that morning when she had sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his white cane tapping off into the distance and when it was silent I stole to the empty parlor to look at books . When he was there I was never able to look at them ; he kept me at his knees , talking and keeping him company to earn my three-cent piece . They were old books , fusty books , and dull enough except for the pictures which were of ladies and soldiers and stiff-legged deer but sometimes I would find an old letter there between the marble-edged leaves or a brown , brittle bouquet of thin summer flowers . Aunt Sarah was upstairs with Rebecca quilting and Suse and Toot were off in the kitchen baking bread and I supposed somehow that Cathie would be with them . Tom ? And there she stood , in the doorway , skinny-legged in her long black stockings and with a green ribbon in her dark hair that seemed to set off the paleness of her face . Hello . May I look at a book , too ? Yes . And I fetched another carpet stool from the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookcase , beside my own . She stole to it silently and sat , tucking her skirts primly beneath her knees and brushing back a dark lock from her eyes , opened The Christian Martyrs and began to read . Until then I had been searching the pages for leaves or valentines or pictures but now , desperately , I pretended to be reading , too . We 're still friends are n't we , Thomas ? Sure , I said softly . I reckon so . If you 're not still mad at me . I never was mad , she said , scowling at the idea . I never was . Well , I said . It certainly was a bad thing I did . I guess I 'm just a hopeless sinner . Aunt Sarah says so anyhow . She sighed and stared at me a while longer . I hid the treasure , she said . The treasure you gave me . I figured that , I said . I hope you hid them good . If Aunt Sarah ever finds them she 'll throw them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in a secret place . Do you mind if I do n't tell you where ? It 's nice to have a secret place .  | No , I said , with a wave of my hand . I do n't mind . It 's good to have a secret place . She sighed again , greatly relieved , and then cleared her throat . They 're in a hole behind a loose brick in the pantry , she said . There ! I 've told you my secret place . You did n't have to , I said . I do n't want the treasures back . I gave them to you for your very own . I know , she said , with a laugh that was half a breath . But there are some special friends you do n't like to keep secrets from . Aunt Sarah never let me play the music box except on Sundays and Christmas but I felt suddenly like both days were come at once and I sprang up and ran over to it and lifted the wide , shining oaken lid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fitted it inside and pulled the lever and listened to the brassy gasp it gave as the coil gathered and the disc crackled as it commenced turning . My , that sure is pretty ! she cried as the chimes of it filled the room with booming , tinkling gold . I just love music ! And we both stared over the rim of the box and listened to it and felt happy and sad all at once because it was an old tune that Uncle Joe sang the words to sometimes : the one about the drunkard 's grave . Is n't that the grandest , saddest tune , she said , casting me a ravishing sidelong look . Yes , I said . Sometimes , she said , I just love to cry . Aunt Rebecca says a good cry washes the soul . Last Sunday after church she told me all about Good Friday and she said it was just two weeks off and that 's when they murdered our Lord . I do n't like that story , I said . Oh , I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand and sad . I do n't see the sense in sad stories , I said . Ones like that , I mean . But she seemed heedless of me and her dark eyes gleamed in a dream of it : the story from those old , whispery pages of Rebecca 's black , wrinkled Scripture . He was just a little child , too ! she said . That 's the sad part ! Who ? Our Lord , she said . King Jesus ! I never could make head nor tail of that story , I said softly . Aunt Sarah reads it to me every year . Oh it 's a grand story ! she said . He was born at Christmastide ? .  | I know that part . And then just three months later  --  they killed him ! A little baby child ! No , I said to her . He was an old man . An old man with a beard . I beg your pardon , Tom , she said , talking to me again like she were older and I was small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday is only April . How could anyone grow up to be an old man in three months ? I shivered again and knew that she was right so I turned off the music box because Aunt Sarah would come raving at me presently and the silence in the room was a judgment . Suse is baking , I said . Maybe she 'll give us a heel . And she followed me to the kitchen and the air steamed with a sweetness that seemed to flower and breathe out spring . Can me and Cathie have a heel ? Well sho ! Sho ! With strawberry preserves ? She winked one wrinkled lid shut and fixed me , birdlike , with cunning speculation of a single scowling eye . ' Gainst you go and spoil your supper , you scampy trunnel-bed trash , Miz Sary 'll have my hide off and hung up to dry ! She wo n't care , I begged , shameless with yearning before that sweet cloud of baking . And she sliced us both heels from the new , buttered loaves : crusty without and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strawberries . We squatted eating and watched . Suse was old but it was Toot that was wise and she swore to me that she had ridden on that very ark that had carried old Noah above God 's vengeful floods and had baked him biscuits that first morning when the bird brought the bough of olive leaves . Yes , Toot was very old and very wise and Toot 's mother Abigail had been even older , even wiser . So old , Toot said , that she used to tell about her mother 's brother being eat up by a lion . And it was not in any circus menagerie show either but on a hill above a place called Sarah Lonnie across the ocean  --  before the slavers took them down the hot , yellow meadow to the sea . And Jesus marched among them , singing all the way . So , I supposed , she would know about that other time : Suse , I said , cupping my sticky face in my palms . Was Jesus an old , old man with a white beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trunnel-bed trash ? Cathie claims that He was just a little baby when they come and killed Him dead ! She had her clay pipe lighted now and I was glad of that because Aunt Sarah forbade Toot to smoke while she was cooking or baking and now she was just as bad as me . She puffed and twinkled wickedly at us both and I knew she was up to a mischief or two . Well sho ! she said . Sho he was ! An ' you mighty lucky they ai n't come to git you yit ! Who ? I breathed . Why , them same sojers that took po ' Jesus to the Cavalry ! That 's who ! Suse was old and she sat apart and drank coffee and looked through the almanac , heedless of words , but pondering the woodcut halfmoons and Pennsylvania farmers and Mike Fink 's fortunes . But it was Toot that was wise and she had been upon that hill , I knew , and so I harked well to this grim and eyewitness testament . He was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? killed Him dead on Good Friday ! And that 's just three months ! Sho ! cried Toot , through clouds of white wisdom . Sho , and dat 's a fack ! And then she bent and wheezed wildly through gales of unaccountable mirth . Aunt Rebecca read me the story , said Cathie then , wiping her sticky fingers on a piece of jelly muslin . And that 's a fact ! It 's the grandest , saddest story ! she said . Hmmph ! muttered the old woman . You would n't like it so well if you knowed the truth ! You two chil'n is just markin ' time ! And we both grew still at that . Sho ! Dey come and took Him did n't they ? And Him jus ' a little baby ? Well dey 's gwine to fetch you , too ! Dey 's just playin ' you out like a fish , little ones ! I do n't care ! I said with a wild , nervous wave of my hand and got up and walked stiffly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close behind my heels like a little frightened rabbit in the wake of my braveness . I walked audaciously into the dark hallway ? green and bleak as the depths of the oceans beneath that long-ago ark and the face of Peggy stared at me from the oval frame upon the faded wall . Cathie put her hand in mine and we stood watching the  | winter night gather like smoke under the hills and far away on the river road I heard the faint tap-tap-tap of Uncle Joe 's white cane upon the cold stones . They wo n't come , I whispered . That lyin ' black devil ! She sighed and squeezed my hand and her fingers were like the arms and legs of a little cold doll . Just the same , she said . It 's mighty good to be friends with people . Yes , I said . Especially at night . But it was at night , most always , that I would be alone . Aunt Sarah had made it plain , from the outset , that old Rebecca and her niece should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bade me , unequivocally , to keep in my place as well . It was a curious , hard vein in her , an old insistence on order and on some ancient family ghost of propriety that wound back through time like a fading , interminable silk ribbon into the Restoration England of her greatgrandmother . Rebecca and Catherine Ellen were expected to work for their keep and when supper was settled they were to go to their room and mind to themselves . They owed us that and we , similarly , owed them the courtesy of keeping out of the circle of their own family lampshine . I think that she was just , at heart , though sometimes she seemed in life , and seems to me still , as cruel as a Moor . I remember her sitting in the pantry window with an old , brass telescope that my Grandfather had kept in the cabin of his boat on the river in the days when steam was the Devil 's own joke in the river towns and farmers lined on the shore to mock the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her eye watching Coy and the halfwit Irish twins from Captina who were hired to help hoe the first corn , spying on them to see that every last drop of sweat was out of them by sundown when she went with the conch to the cold stone stoop and blew them in to supper . Yet , when a stonemason from Wheeling came to build the slave house , it is said , she marched among the old man and his sons through every hour of their labors , noting every trowel of lime , every crying stroke of the stone-saw , each clapboard , each last square Wheeling nail ; striding primly among them with her little bonnet on her hair as if she were bound for town and the inevitable parasol in her dry , clean fingers , faintly sweet of lavender and rose water , and calculating from time to time on a ruled tablet the cost of their materials and their work until at last , when they were nearly  | done and the sandstone gleamed , fresh-hewn and white as angel 's food in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and draw up a new contract . Why , madam ? Why , because ! she cried , as if to reproach him for a cheap deception against himself . You wo n't make a penny on this job when you 're done ! You must draw up new papers and charge me not a jot less than one hundred and fifty dollars ! Cold though . Colder than the heart of the black iron deer that stood in the front yard , and that sometimes seemed almost gentlenatured by comparison . Cold , when she would deny me the pleasure of going to the small room of old Rebecca and my new friend to chat a little , pleasant time and hear the friendly growl of the old woman 's stomach like the ebb and fall of bees quarreling in an August hive . As for the two of them , they seemed far happier than the rest of us who were left to the balance of the shadowy house in isolation from them and from each other as well . Most often I would stay in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and washing the dishes and pots and that was a kind of shadowed joy , for when they were not teasing me outright , Toot would be frightening me with her first-hand tales of times long gone : she had lived in the days of the Prophets : had known Jonah and dried him clean of behemoth 's frothing slobber on the very day he had emerged and she had seen the sad core of the apple outside Eden , marked plain with the small , sad teeth of the woman on the one side and on the other the place where Adam had eaten . In fact , it seems to me now that Toot meant no fiction in her accounts of these things : I think she had lived them through to believing in the black , throbbing nights there in the guttering tallow twilight of candleshine in the slave house . Sho ! You seen that , too ! Well , I declare ! Sho ! Seen hit clear as I see dat cream pitcher yonder ! And nary one of dem lions so much as lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dat cook Dan'l his supper dat night when dey let him out of dere ? Who ? I would whisper , knowing , but wanting to stretch out the sweetness of that scary telling . Me ! Dat 's who ! Biscuits with apple butter ! Dried corn stewed in cream ! An ' a fine slice of ham  --  fried to grandness !  | Can I have an apple ? Sho . And she would let the fallen word lie and move industriously about her redding chore till my hand opened to take it from the box and then she would resume her little teasing with consummate timing . Sho . Take an apple . ' Cos , you know what may happen ! My fingers would close , empty , and I would lift my shaggy head and stare at her , moon-faced with alarm . What ? Sho . Take an apple . An ' take yo chances on gittin ' the snaky one ! I would be far from the apple box now and Suse who was not clever enough to tease would giggle from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairwell , sipping her black coffee and wrinkling her lip over Toot 's game . Sho ! Gwan ! Git one ! You heard me tell dat tale las ' night ! Hit was Eden and dat apple looked jus ' as juicy and red as the one you was about to eat ! And li'l Miss Eve , she picked it ? . That 's not a real story . Sho it 's real ! I was dere , boy ! I seen it ! And it was a mighty sore temptation not to pick up dat core where dey flung it and take a bite my own self . I regarded the cluster of red apples in the old salt box . Are they all snaky apples ? No , she said . Just one snaky apple in de box . Which one ? I whispered , and she giggled and the candlelight laughed , too , with shadows , and the sunny shape of its dancing finger was a mocking , too . In every windfall , she said suddenly , dere 's one snaky apple . Dat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dey 's no snakes can climb a tree but when an apple 's lying there sunnin ' itself in de grass dere 's nothin ' to stop a copperhead from walkin ' right up to it and givin ' it his curse . Does he bite it ? What you talkie ' ' bout ! Bite it ! Snakes got no teeth for bitin ' apples ! He crawls over it and twitches on it and when he done that he goes on back to his hole in de rocks and he do n't bother none of de other apples in de windfall ! Cursin ' dat one apple is all he can take for one day . Hit 's a strain ! I stared at the apples till they seemed to droop and fall into a blurred and disordered design like melted wax .  | If you was to tell me which , I whispered , I would n't eat that one . I ai n't got de gift ! she said and then subsided , carefully measuring out the time so that each part of her joke would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she added after that long spell of stillness . ' Cos Suse is the seventh child of a seventh child and Suse has de seconds ight ! Tell me , Suse ! I said , going to stand before her . And delighted that Toot had let her be part of the teasing game Suse would rock furiously and be gasping with joy and hissing with wheezy winds of catarrhic , silent laughter like a gaping turtle , her toothless gums shining like tallow in the candleshine . Sho . Gwan and take a chance . Sho . Eat dat apple and have Jehovah lash you from Eden with a pine-thong ! And I would go appleless away , and watch Uncle Joe , his blind , pink face lifted to the night-darkened window in the parlor and amuse myself by wondering how a blind man knows sun from moon or tells starlight from the burning wink of fireflies in a river dusk . Since Cathie 's sickness I had felt nothing toward the strange little girl but a kind of feverish curiosity , a sickly solicitude . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unceasing dream of Abijah and his high , proud returning . I was certain that I stood a little better in Aunt Sarah 's regard since this change of heart and I was sitting on a stool in her room one day watching her winking steel needle go in and out of a quilt square like a dolphin playing in a red sea and I suddenly began to pour it all out to her . Cathie and me is the best friends in the world , I cried . She can play with any toy of mine and I do n't care a bit ! My my , it certainly is strange how different you get to feel about people once you get to know them , ai n't it , Aunt Sarah ! Do n't say ai n't . Is n't it . Not so special , she said . I do n't feel that 's so special true . Some of a body 's first feelings are right . But a body has to learn to let the will of God have its way . We ca n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , not frowning with puzzlement , not showing anything on my face , because I was so terribly mixed up with what she was getting ready to say and I wanted her to finish it . It was natural , she said , for you to resent the stranger in the midst .  | Old Rebecca had been helping her quilt that afternoon but suddenly Aunt Sarah had sent her off to the parlor to dust . Quilting , in the end , was more play than work and work was the board and rent that Rebecca Hornbrook paid in that house . I just love Cathie , I said , reckless with a fullness of feeling , and Aunt Sarah 's needle halted and shone like a steel tooth that had paused in chewing , and she fixed me with a long , quiet stare . No , she said . I 'll not have that kind of talk . I gulped and stared at the floor boards , grinning foolishly . No , she said again . I 'm going to raise you as my sister would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equals and to accept them and not to mingle with commonness . Is it bad , I whispered , for Cathie to be my friend ? No , she said . But you must remember that her people are common . Her mother was no better than a gypsy on the river roads . Her father is a rascal and a dreamer and a ne'er-do-well who walked off and left his sister to mind his daughter while he went to the prairies to help start a War . A War ? Yes , a War . I do n't know what nonsense she 'll tell you . Bige Hornbrook was always queer as a boy . And when your Grandfather was on the river he often said that a man like Bige Hornbrook was more danger to rivermen than a sawyer in mid-channel . Many 's the night he 'd take his boat through the narrows with every lantern and candle on her snuffed out , black as the inside of a whale 's belly , and him out on the texas deck shouting the Lord 's Psalms in a voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon glad to go back to sleep again for it was a mockery  --  a shame and a mockery ! He meant no righteousness in his reading ! Like as not it was to beg God 's pardon because he had thrashed an octoroon to death in the boiler room . Your Grandfather told that and no one questioned him . No one ever questioned your Grandfather 's word  --  not on the river or anywhere else for that matter for he was a man of God and he treated his niggers as mortal beings and never raised his hand to one in forty years of boating . Never . So , as I say , Thomas , there 's the mark of meanness and of commonness on the Hornbrooks . I took them in as I would a starving gypsy on the river roads . I would do that for a dog . But they are common and I want no one in this house speaking of love  --  except God 's love and that 's our duty to Him not them . She paused and lowered her eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper of her taffeta skirts was like a breath beneath the quilt . They are servants , she went on . Rebecca and the girl are servants . No , do n't frown like that  --  as if I had said something cruel . I did not make their condition in life . God had His reasons for that , not I. I did not make that evil match of which the poor child was issue . It 's not my fault that Bige Hornbrook is a fool and a dastard . They are servants because that is the makings of Providence and if it were not for me they would be hawking brass buttons and thread on the streets of Wheeling . They are servants . Mark that , Thomas . And mark it well ! Yes , I thought later in the house , that is true and I had been right from the first and yet there is something dangerous here : something that I must be careful over , because if I drive her away again that will be a sin , too . Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be her friend and I have given something of myself that I can not take back . But something old and evil and musing itched and stirred in me again : I could almost feel it in my loins : perhaps it is there ( in the body 's own Eden ) that such judgments and decisions ultimately lie : in the loins . Winter was thin and sour upon the land : old and pinched , and the sun strained to pierce it and yet spring had not yet come and everything seemed breathless and lackluster in that solstice interlude . Cathie and I had gone to play in the orchard and the wild , dead wind had blown all that day and shaken the black twigs of the apple trees above us . Do you remember your mother and father ? No , I whispered , not looking at her face . I remember my mother ! she cried with shining eyes , her nervous , white fingers plucking briars from her black cotton stockings . Yes ! My mother was the most beautiful woman on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was suddenly such an uncontrollable evilness in my mouth . That 's a lie , I said softly and chewed a bitter twig from the apple tree , tasting the greenness that already lay within it , listening for spring .

Ask your Aunt Sarah  --  she knew my mother ! And your father worried her to death , I said , sick at myself and yet unable to stop . Thomas ! How can you say a thing like that ! I thought that we were friends ! Sure , I said . We 're friends . Half-friends !

You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breath that was hollow with dread . Oh , Tom ! Just the same , I said in a voice that seemed not my own : but some snatch of evil conversation overheard in a dream . Your father is really a fool ! And it was not till a full moment after the stone had struck me between the eyes that I realized how deeply I had wounded her . She sprang back gasping but I was swifter and we went down together in the dead dry grass and she struggled like a fish beneath me when I caught her wrists and pinned them to earth . I 'm glad I did it ! she whispered through furious , clenched teeth , and it was all I could do to hold her there , listening to the mingling of our harsh , furious breathing , and feeling the trickle of blood down my nose like the summer tiptoe of a ladybird . I 'm glad ! I 'm glad ! she wailed to the wind , but stopped fighting to be loose and I thought miserably to myself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is only a girl . You could have kilt me ! I yelled . I wish I had ! I wish I had ! I hate you ! she cried , struggling again now , straining her face from side to side and biting her lip in shame . I will kill you if ever I get the chance ! I snickered and let her free then because I was frightened : I had never seen her angry before . And I stalked cockily to the welling spring in the worn cup of sandstone by the embracing roots of the oldest tree in my Grandfather 's orchard and then , squatting , with my back to her still , thrust my face into the aching-cold water . When I turned to her again , holding my bandanna to the stinging welt on my forehead she was sitting , cross-legged , like a wild , slim Buddha in the winter grass , staring at me with calm and furious eyes .  | If it was n't for my Aunt Sarah you and your Aunt Rebecca would he selling buttons and thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flinch , nor the dark eyes lower from me , though her underlip seemed to draw up a little into the red shadow of her mouth . Just do n't ever forget that , Catherine Ellen Hornbrook ! You and your high and mighty ways ! Why , when you first come to live with us this winter you had everything you owned in that stinkin ' old mildewed carpetbag ! Everything you owned ! She still said nothing and her face betrayed nothing except the barest sparkle on the rim of her lower eyelid and I could not be sure that it was a tear . Everything ! I roared , marching up and down in the grass like a lord of the valley . And you told me that day that your father was going off to be a  --  a King ! Lord- amighty ! Where did the King go , Catherine ? Where is he ? Where 's King Abijah ? And I stood before her , fists on my hips , mocking and sick at heart . You and your aunt , I said softly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared , stricken , speechless , her dark pupils spreading like the feather of a tiny , dark bird , her clenched knuckles a-shine.  | Servants ! Servants ! I yelled , knowing that I had touched her at last . And I thought I would be sick at my stomach with the sound of my words . Servants ! I cried again , choking , and she whirled and ran off among the spidery black lace of the apple trees in that cold time before the spring , the dead time , and I watched her run through the grass of the long river meadow toward the distant house and I stood by the stone fence my Grandfather had fashioned and yelled it into the dead , winter wind until my throat ached and filled with the sourness of defeat . In the hollowed stone where the spring water trickled from the hill and gathered like a cup of sky I squatted again and stared down at the wild face mirrored there : peering back at me like a garden god among the winter branches . And I counted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stained that water and that sky , reddening it . I flung myself to earth and bit into the mushroomtasting earth the land racked with winter and tired of itself : tasting the earth as I bit into it : old earth , tasting of an old season : like kissing the flesh of someone rocking and tired and mumbling , toothless  | and slack-cheeked , counting clock-ticks and waiting for Death 's tap upon the pane . I screamed and wept until my jaws ached and my teeth were cold . I hate them ! I hate them ! And yet I could not name the ones I hated and she was only a girl and the only one I had to play with , the only one I had ever had as friend and I had to hate her , too . And she would survive it all . And endure . Because even now I could hear her far voice in the yard above the slave house , chasing the old hound and spending her wild laughter on the wind . They were all there , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those special treasures , except the hawk 's gray feather and it had blown off onto the floor . I fingered them one by one , still stinging with anger and shame , still feeling the throb of the bruise of my forehead . And I could not guess , for the life of me , where the magic of them had gone : these things that she had given back to me . Thomas , have you been fighting ? And Aunt Sarah was there behind me . No 'm , I whispered , shamed and ashamed . I fell . Me and Cathie was running in the orchard . I hit my head on a stone . Catherine Ellen ? And I saw her then , standing behind the expanse of my Aunt 's billowing crinoline : a hateful , suck-finger girl with mocking in her eyes . Is that true , Catherine Ellen ? Did Thomas fall ? Yes . Say " yes ma'am " when you speak to older women . That 's manners . Yes ma'am . We were playing touch-tag in the orchard , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Tom caught his foot in a root and went a-tumbling . Come yonder , Thomas , and let me put some hartshorn on it ! And I went with her to her room and let her dab it with the stinging rag of choking spirits and then she left me and went downstairs and I wondered how to face her : Cathie . And then she appeared suddenly in the doorway and stood staring at me . I put your things on your bed , she said . I glared and sucked my lip like a fool . She stood staring a while longer .  | I could n't find one of the arrowheads , she said . I think it fell through a crack in the floor . It do n't matter . I could hear her breathing quietly and I could smell the little-girl , soap smell of her . She knows we lied , she said suddenly . What ? Your Aunt Sarah knows , she said . I can tell . She knows we were fighting again . I only lied so she would n't punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you some kind of something wonderful ! I suppose you think that 's mighty high and mighty of you ! I do n't need your lies ! Tom , what you said is so . I do n't need your protection ! It 's true , Tom , she said , numbly , dumbly . About Aunt Rebecca and me . We 're just servants here . I had n't any cause to be so mad ! I fell silent then and stared miserably at a little china boat full of brooches and pins on Aunt Sarah 's dresser scarf . Lord , that was the terror of it : every time my hatred for Cathie came out clean and bare something would rise up to tell me that it was n't really us against each other but us against them ; they 'd force us always into a togetherness despite ourselves . I forget sometimes , she said , her voice near a soft singing : husky and windy with the dream within her . Sometimes I forget that me and Aunt Rebecca are just servants here . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be when he comes back that I think that time is come  --  I half think it 's here already and Abijah is back and we 're together again on the Nellie Queen and he is King and we go sailing to his Kingdom . I sat down suddenly in a rocker and stared out the window at gray March meadows and listened to the rising flow of wind that had suddenly ceased in its fitful gusts and now coursed steady across the earth . Do you really think , I whispered , that he 'll come back ? Oh , yes ! Yes ! I could fight it no more : it was round me now , that dream : it had wrapped me silently through those lonely months until its gentle ivy had sent tendrils into every stone and cornice of my mind . Tom ! Yes ?  | Could we be friends  --  again ? Yes . Oh , Tom , I just got so mad ! I 'm sorry I hit you with that stone ! She ran over and stared at it , her bland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forefinger and probed the flesh to either side . Does it hurt awful ? I shook my head manfully and drowned in blushes . My my ! she said . It 's a caution what a body will do when they 're mad . It 'll go away , I said , waving my hand like an old soldier . I met her eyes then for the first time in long moments . I 'm sorry I said them things , I said . I do n't know why I do ! I knew though that the treasures were gone : there was nothing to give back to her : they were just things now . Nothing could bring that back . And she did not ask for them and that night after supper I buried them all in a hole in the thawed black earth at the corner of the house by the puzzle tree . The wind persisted , like a soft , quickening tide . Most always in my childhood I remember loving to hear the wind : at least when it was the common kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falling and quarreling with itself and making a manysound like the telling of a tale . But the wind that March was unvarying and mounting like a rising , desperate sigh and I hated it . How are you feeling , Rebecca ? Eh ? Is that Bige ? It 's Sarah , Rebecca . Do you think you could take a little mutton broth tonight ? Sarah ? Who ? Ah , Sarah ! Ah , Lord bless you , Sarah ! Rebecca had fainted that day in the meat house with a twelvepound ham in her arms and gone a-sprawling among the rakes and hoes and it was Toot that found her : babbling like a fat , foolish baby about strange times and long-gone names , one side of her round , blameless face puckered and drawn down like the melted face of a wax doll held too close to an open oven door . It took all of us to get her indoors and to fetch her upstairs to bed and all the while she was dead weight in our hands and yet as soft as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you Bige Hornbrook ? Now where 's Nellie ?  | Nellie 's dead , Rebecca ! Get hold of your wits ! This is Sarah Christopher ! Gracious , Rebecca ! Sarah ? Who ? Ah , Lord bless you , dearie ! You 're so good to me ! Everyone was in the hallway behind Aunt Sarah : myself and the Negro women and old Coy . Uncle Joe stood and hollered from the loot of the hall stairs , hammering his cane on the last step , demanding to know when supper would be set out on the table . I did not see Cathie until Aunt Sarah turned and herded us all downstairs like sheep and came railing and shouting at Uncle Joe to be silent . Cathie had been standing far behind us in the shadow of the doorway to Aunt Sarah 's room , her face gone to fish-belly whiteness . Is she dead ? she whispered to Aunt Sarah . Is Aunt Rebecca dead ? No , she is not dead , Catherine Ellen ! Your Aunt Rebecca has had a sinking spell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts the house down . You go tend her . And she left Cathie there on that threshold of dread and drove me before her down the steps into the hallway . What 's wrong ? yelled my uncle . Why ai n't supper laid out ? Hush ! Hush , you old fool ! Rebecca 's had a stroke ! A stroke ? Oh , indeed now ! Oh my , that 's a pity ! He seemed overcome with genuine shock and sat down suddenly on the floor beside the hallrack , clutching his cane like a shepherd 's crook and blinking his blind , white eyes . Get up , Joseph ! You 'll catch your death and I 'll not have two sick fools in my house at once ! Get up or I 'll pack you off to the Home . It was his mortal dread : his perpetual dream of fear : that he would be sent to the Old Folks ' Home at Wheeling and she was always quick to use it like a stick upon him when he balked at this or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , at meal time . Ai n't that a pity ! A stroke ! Hush and eat , Joseph ! It was a kind of secret wonder : his eating . Though he was blind , his fingers moved with an old and almost courtly politeness among the china and silver : pinching a biscuit delicately from the plate , finding the apple butter with the other hand : his fingertips imperceptibly brushing things , naming them by the heat of them : I would sometimes think that his fingers had noses , to watch them sniffing and nuzzling among that veritable crockery shop of gravy boats and sugar bowls and coffee cups . Yet he never spilled so much as a  | drop of gravy on his clean shirt , not so much as a crumb of bread : he was neat as a shrew . Though now tonight he seemed unnerved and slopped cream on his trouser leg and dropped a biscuit in his lap and I think that even as a child I knew why : because he was old and had felt the settling of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to have a little talk with you after supper . Thomas , Joseph  --  you will leave the table as soon as the meal is finished . And we obeyed and went but I hid in the hallway and heard every word of what she said despite Uncle Joe who set the music box to chiming in the parlor to ring away the mood of dissolution which had chilled him at supper . Catherine Ellen , said Aunt Sarah . Yes 'm . Your Aunt Rebecca has had a stroke . What is a stroke ? It is a kind of brain fever , I think . No  --  I 'll not say . I 'm not a physician . I can only say it 's some act of God 's Providence . She is ? . Is she sick bad ? Please do n't interrupt me , child . I know this is a hard thing for you but I want you to let me say this . Yes 'm . She is sick abed . She ? . Will she die ? Let me finish . Gracious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question like that ? Only God knows that . He will decide that hour  --  for her  --  and for you and me , as well . But no matter . That 's apart from us . I just want to say now that I think it is your duty to take care of her while she is infirm . Yes 'm . You say yes 'm but I wonder if you know what Duty is . I love my Aunt Rebecca , said Cathie , and it was long years after that I was to hear that same faint choke of desperation in her voice . Yes , you love her . Of course , you do . She is all you have . Yes , she sighed , and the wine of courage was warm in her again . Until Abijah comes back . If he comes back , child . And that I sorely doubt . Oh , no ! You must n't say that !  | It is a little hard to set in my own kitchen and have a child of eight impudently tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , waiting for Cathie to say that she was sorry but she did not , and with my face blind in the corner of the wall there , behind the corner of the door , I could see her face in my mind : small and stubborn and scared . Now may I finish , Catherine Ellen ? Have I your permission to finish speaking in my own kitchen ? Yes 'm . Thank you . I was going to say that whatever else you think about me  --  however you may think of me as hard and mean and crotchety  --  - you know that I am a Christian woman . You know that I live by my religion and the religion of my sainted father . Duty , my dear . I saw it my Duty to take you and your Aunt in when your father turned you into the roads . I would do it for a gypsy on the river road . For a dog . Far off in the house now she had commenced to sing : old Rebecca , and suddenly laid there before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a ringing , rousing good-time tune that old-timers still sing at country fairs and in the lampshine of minstrel boats and Aunt Sarah stopped and fell silent , smiling thin-lipped as if she had known how common Rebecca was from the start . Well ! she said with a little sarcastic laugh . " Old Dan Tucker . " My , that 's a pretty tune to be singing when a body 's carried to their deathbed . Is she ? ! Hush ! And mark this moment well , my little lady ! And pray to our Lord that when you are borne to your last sheets you may have led the sort of life ? . Why is she singing ? ? that will bring to your last breath a hymn in His praise . And she came over and shut the door against the sound and I had to press my ear close to the crack now to hear the rest of what she was saying to Cathie there by the cooling oven . ? I will try to patch up the harm that your elders have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set you on Duty 's path ! And to begin with I expect you to take complete charge of your Aunt while she is sick . If she needs setting up with o ' nights  --  you must do that ! You must take her her meals . You must bathe her . You must ? . She 's calling my name now , ma'am .  | You may go to her when you 've sworn that you 'll do your Duty by her , child ! I swear ! she whispered and fled like a faint dark shadow through the hall and I listened as her small shoes trod softly and unfailingly up the stairway of night and were gone . Far above me , above that gaunt tower of taffeta and twinkling jet I saw my Aunt Sarah 's face in the lamplight of the hallway and , like the painful squeeze of sap from some dense winter wood , tears were slowly trickling down her cold cheeks . It seemed that the wind that had risen that month had come like a rider to bear her off : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For as it steadily rose through those nights her own lamps went winking and failing down the dark and it seemed that all the fever and life that ebbed slowly from her went into the body of the little girl and gathered there in those hot and desperate eyes . Here , Aunt . Drink this . Eh ? Who 's that ? Bige ? It 's me , Aunt ! It 's Cathie ! Drink this  --  it 's good for you ! There ! She would do anything you told her . I think if Aunt Sarah had come storming into the room and beckoned to her to be off downstairs about her dusting she would have risen somehow and dragged her numb , slack self off down those steps with a good will , humming some outrageous old mountain tune as she went . As it was , Aunt Sarah came twice daily ( no more  --  no less ) and stood in the doorway with her arms wrapped in her apron to the wrists and asked how the patient was and if there was anything she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got her head turned and fixed Aunt Sarah in her watery good eye and smiled a half-smile and mistook her for a drunken river rouster dead for forty years and Aunt Sarah , offended and mute , would bow politely and withdraw again . I stood by helpless and chewed my knuckle and wondered why I could not weep and felt the ache and throb of some old loss of my own that I could not remember . And suddenly in the clear , high , cathedral vastness of the night she would life her voice again and commence singing . Raining raining , cold stormy weather ! In comes the old man drinkin ' up the cider !  | Hush , Aunt ! Oh do be quiet ! You 'll wake them all ! Oh please , Aunt ! And I would have started up at the sound and dug my fingers into the whispering quilt squares and lain shaking for a while , listening to the rest . Get out of the way for Old Dan Tucker ! He 's too late to get his supper ! Oh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fetch the fiddle ? Ho , dearie , you must n't kiss me here ! Mama will see ! Never a sound , never so much as a whisper from Aunt Sarah 's shut-up room , but even that stillness was tacit with a kind of violence . And yet I think she understood  --  perhaps was even moved by it ? perhaps her silence was an answer , a blessing , a farewell . For though her whole soul must have recoiled at these wild night echoes of cotillions and brandy and dances under the river moon : though she must have heard in these fragments of Rebecca 's last soliloquies the shameless hammer of hussy heels and the thrashing of the boots of the men from Shawneetown and Louisville and the keelboatmen from down under the hills in the Chickasaw Agency , she felt stirring in her heart and mind some old , long-stilled reverence for Life and Death . And perhaps she was reminded that all her own days might be sung of and ended and forgotten in a few loose verses cried out to a silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would creep out and go the cold length of the hallway in my bare feet and whisper to the girl from the threshold : Can I do anything to help ? She would turn her face to me , a livid , vivid mask of desolation and shake her cheeks numbly . I 'll take care of her , she sometimes whispered , but , more often , would say nothing and turn her eyes to the yellow mask in the candlelight again . Once I crept into the room and stood beside her and reached out and took her hand and tried to squeeze it , but the gesture failed somehow and my hand fell to my side again : lank and helpless . But she wanted to talk . I wished she would n't carry on , she said with a dry tongue . She do n't know , I said . She ca n't help it . Lordy , Cathie , she must be awful sick . I just wish she would n't sing those songs , whispered Cathie , her eyes widening and the dark slits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just songs , I said . No , she said . They 're common . They 're what ? They 're common , she said . I know what your Aunt Sarah must think when she hears her sing those songs ! They 're bad songs ! My Aunt was n't bad ! I could n't think of a thing in the world to say because they really were the most common river-bank tunes in the world ; the kind Stickney 's Minstrels used to sing on the Sensation and Mister Emmett 's black dandies and their banjos in the good-time days . Is that you , Bige ? General Jamieson ? Why , bless my soul ! It is General Jamieson ! Bige , run and fetch the demijohn of peach brandy from the trunk yonder ! Gen'l , you must be chilled to the bone ! General Jamieson had been a thread in the cloth of legend in the bottomlands , an old soldier through no more a general than I was , but a soldier none the less and dead and gone to lead his last army of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a man of stiff and starchy temper , I would suppose , from the tales they spun of him : less than five feet tall but fierce as a hummingbird with a great snow-shock of hair like Old Hickory and a tomahawk scar in his forehead that he could put his thumb into up to the second joint . But a ghost now and yet she saw him and made a place for him in that final room of her life , a last warm country hospitality . Bige ? Where 's Nellie ? Bige ? Eh ? Eh ? Who 's that yonder in my pantry ? Is that those young Lindsay scamps ? Ha ! I might have knowed it ! And I suppose you heard I 'd made some seafoam candy this mornin ' ! All right ! All right , I say ! Help yourselves , children ! There 's the lambs ! Ho ! Ho ! It 's night already and time to light the candles ! Where , where do the days go ? Life is a dream ! A dream and we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't shout like that . Aunt Sarah understands . She knows she 's ter'ble sick , Cathie . No . She do n't understand . She hears her talk that way  --  yelling the names of all those people  --  all those common people . I just wish like anything she would be still ! Why ' pon my soul ! cried the old woman with a voice like a hickory fiddle in the moonlight of her bed . Here it is broad day again ! Where , where do the days go ? Merrily merrily merrily merrily ! A dream is all ! ' Pon my soul ? ' pon my soul ? . And suddenly Cathie moved forward in the moonlight and it  | flooded her face suddenly and I saw it twisted and anguished and dryeyed with it . Shut up , Aunt ! Bige ? Be still , Aunt ! Cathie ! I whispered . She 's ter'ble sick ! You must n't ! Rainin ' rainin ' cold stormy weather  --  in comes the old man ? ! Aunt ! Be still ! And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and struck the old woman 's numb , slack cheek and then both hands flew to her gaping mouth and she stared , helpless and stricken , at the thing she had done . Cathie ! whimpered the old one . You never used to hit me when you was little ! Oh , Aunt ! Aunt ! Forgive me ! Forgive me ! Cathie ! Little Catherine Ellen ! crooned Rebecca , and it was all forgotten and forgiven now . Run yonder , child , and help yourself to ' lasses cookies and a cup of milk from the pitcher in the ice house ! There 's a lamb ! And , Cathie ? Fetch another candle , dearie ! These winter days it gets so dark so soon ! So soon ! Cathie stood frozen , speechless and slumped into her hands , shaking and sobbing with a blessing of tears . And suddenly Aunt Sarah had appeared in the doorway in her nightdress and cap , her jaws wound round with a cloth like a cadaver in her own right . Thomas , get yonder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . Do as I say , Thomas ! But she needs me ! When she 's gone she wo n't have anybody ! Neither of us has anybody ! When we are older the death of someone close is an agony  --  but it can not dream to touch the epic and classic tragedy that death is to a child . When we are older , part of us goes when someone we love dies . But to a child a god is gone . In the last few days Rebecca seemed to subside into a glum and puff-cheeked retrospection and , having demanded that her old spectacles be wiped in muslin till the tiny lenses were clear as a body might want them to be to watch for General Jamieson , or the dream children or the Dark Rider upon that wind-blown road , lay mum  | and pensive with the glasses pinched on the end of her round nose and looked at none of us and waited . How is she ? Aunt Sarah asked Willie Curtis , the doctor from up the hill . Gonter die ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the quid which hung in his udderlike cheek . There 's nothing we can do ? She 'll not last the week , I say ! he snapped and flicked dust from his stovepipe and was gone up the road to the house of his sister and a dipper of applejack to save him from the damp . Then , said my Aunt Sarah , that is no room for a child ! Stay here in the kitchen , Thomas ! I 'll fetch Catherine Ellen down here and stay with Rebecca till the end . An end , one might suppose , that was far off-riding to judge from her singing which , now , suddenly and almost as if it had surprised herself , roused and briskly caroled through the house . Go tell Aunt Sally ! Go tell Aunt Sally ! Go tell Aunt Sally , the old gray goose is . Hush , Rebecca . Lie still . It 's Sarah ! Everything is all right . Catherine Ellen , run yonder . No 'm . Catherine Ellen , mind now ! Run downstairs and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll not . She 's my Aunt . I 'm obliged to stay with her . Catherine Ellen , this is not a time for impudence . Now mind me . No 'm . I 'll not . I listened in the hallway with my ear at the foot of the stairs for I was the sneak-o ' - the- world and would have eavesdropped on God Himself if I had been sure where His quarters were and would have learned who was planned to be born that day and who to be taken away . Cathie was like someone old with the voice of a child : she would not go ; I knew that flames would not have driven her from that room and Aunt Sarah knew it , too , and retreated before it as she had never done before and would not soon do again . And as if this victory were insufficient , Cathie , moved by some strange dark need , stood still on the threshold and told Aunt Sarah why it must be so : that she should stay . She is my Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is Abijah 's sister . He would want me to take care of her because when he rode off that day he told us to take care of one another . He said  | that and I said I would do it , Miss Christopher ! Yes , I did , and I have to . And you yourself told me that it was my Duty . Yes , you were right ! Before God it was my duty you said . Yes , child ! Oh Lord save us all ! I had not ever heard her so moved , to speak so warmly , with so much aching in her throat : my cold , proud Aunt Sarah . Raining raining cold stormy weather ! rang that gay , uncracked voice . Please ! pleaded Cathie . Go away ! Let us alone ! Let us alone ! Please ! Oh , I 'm sorry ! I 'm impudent ! But go away ! Please ! Child ! Yes ! Yes , child ! And she swept down the stairways and whispered past me in her tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wandering with a sorrow that shamed her cold pride . Oh , Aunt ! Aunt , be still ! Bige ? No . No , Aunt ! It 's Cathie ! General Jamieson ? Hush , Aunt ! Get out of the way for Old Dan Tucker ! He 's too late to get his supper ! Light a candle , love ! Oh raise the shade , dearie , the days ? so short  --  so short ! It 's dusk and suppertime and I have n't shelled one of them peas . Bige ? Aunt , please ! Hush ! Hush ! Do n't let them hear you ! Nellie ? Is that Nellie ? Why , bless my soul ! Me eyes must be failin ' me ! It 's Tom 's mother  --  it 's Ella Christopher ! And I stood wrapped round in fear while the ghost of my long dead and unremembered mother came and took her turn with the others and stood at the bed of the dying Rebecca . Is that you , Bige ? Who 's ? ? Who 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah 's Peggy ! I would not have wanted to have seen Aunt Sarah 's face then as she would now fix it , turning it to the wall and burying her eyes in the dumb , unreflecting wood . But now Rebecca had abated in her outcries and seemed to subside muffled in happy chuckles and bright anticipation . Her long , good life had been , in those last days , ribboned out before us all to touch and feel and see , like a bolt of good , staunch drygoods , printed through with cheap , sweet flowers and fresh from the buggy of some honest drummer . It began to rain that afternoon and the wind rose and lashed the  | house with white sheets of it , blowing hard from the river , and struggling its crystal against the windowpanes and streaming down the house and bounding on the road . Since Rebecca had called out my mother 's name I had grown numb with thoughts . By my window now , harking to wind and rain , I could still hear nothing but the echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name and I thought to myself : Yes , she was there . She came and stood before her bed , right there by the hair trunk in the little room with the cold breath . My mother came and stood there and she saw her . I 've got to know . I 've got to know . And nothing could have kept me from that threshold now . I fled down the hall and darted past Cathie and confronted the old one , the wild face with the spectacles now fallen and dangling from her lip , life gone and sweet laughter gone and the song and lust stilled at last . Is my mother beautiful ? I cried out . But she was dead and Cathie said nothing because she had done all that God and Aunt Sarah had asked of her and even when these were done she had done more : had closed the secret eyes and , because they had no pennies , either of them , she had cut two neat horn buttons from her ragged child 's coat and set them on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had not really subsided but had passed us by and was howling now against other windows somewhere behind the world . The morning of the old woman 's funeral Uncle Joe relinquished his chair in the parlor like a meek child , and a little fearfully , for it was not wholly clear to him who had died . In blindness and in age I think he had come to think of death with a kind of generalness ; a failing in the tissue of all humankind . Ah , do n't she look natural ! someone said , everyone said , and it became the day 's chief falsehood for , in fact , the substance of Rebecca Hornbrook lay heaped glum and dull as a wad of tallow there in the coarse pine box . The Negro women were set to clean the parlor and found little enough to dust for Rebecca had gone that way with her feather duster not ten days before and whatever she did she always had tried to make it her best . And old Cynthie Cox and Miss Dulcie  | Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buggy and brought stone jars of potato salad and fried chicken wrapped in pages from Godey 's and , for what purpose none of us could imagine , a demijohn of turpentine . Willie was tipsy ( he was never in his life any more drunk than he was sober ) and he came across the parlor behind the two women with whom he lived , swaying faintly and yet decorously , and with elegance bore the demijohn of turpentine like a temple lamp in his tapering , waxlike fingers , and hiccupped softly . And it rained . It seemed the penultimate downpour and I suspected before long that black Toot would go to the window and watch anxiously for her old friend Noah to come riding through the submerged mountains . Cathie kept apart from us all : dressed in her good black dress and with her moon face wan and silvery under her dark cloak of hair . And I could not face her somehow because I think I knew how much of me I would find mirrored there : how much of the grief and loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pastor Blake came and Elmer Thornton , the undertaker , fussed and picked around his handiwork like an Italian music master primping his star pupil for her first recital . I dreaded him with a loathing that choked me . He seemed Death 's own advocate and he would stand and let his eye rove round the room and rub his dry , chalky palms one against the other and survey each of us in his turn , the measuring eye and the practiced , swift estimate of the size of the box we would need and the price we would be worth when the shovel tamped the neat mound at last . And I wondered to myself that day with the strange and candid innocence of childhood who would bury Elmer Thornton when he came at last to the black hour . Curiously the house seemed a-bustle with an almost Christmas energy  --  Death seemed to generate its own industry and liveliness all around it  --  and everyone was hungry  --  everyone but Cathie , everyone but me  --  and neighbors had brought enough to feed a church picnic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mortal hunger as if Death had made us all love life so fiercely that day that we could never be filled , could never taste Life 's substances strong enough upon our living tongues . Bless me ! cried Dulcie Curtis in that wild , happy voice that nothing , not funerals at least , ever softened . There 's the Captain 's grandson  --  Tom . And she came over and threw her stiff , scratchy taffeta arms around  | me and made me kiss her cheek which troubled me because her face was so powdered it made me sneeze : sweet-fragrant with a vanilla scent like a sugar-dusted cake and there was a wart on her chin with five great bristles like a small and useless brush and I was careful not to let that touch my face , nor her hands which smelled eternally of lemons . At the moment when Pastor Blake had opened his Scripture and spoken the appropriate words , Doctor Willie , swaying and smiling , his eyes far away in some occult speculation over Life and Death , bumped incautiously against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small medicine bottle of bourbon whiskey in his pocket and , with one boot unmoving in the spreading , incriminating puddle of Sin on my Aunt Sarah 's parlor rug , he had stared down at it and then at us and remarked urbanely and civilly ( although no one had said a word ) : It 's a lie ! And when it was over and the lid , charitably , closed on the poor clay mask we followed the black coach and the broken-winded mare up the soggy , torrent-wild road to the place on the hill , beyond Dulcie 's house , where the stones were and the names and the carved angels against the sky . I could not see Cathie when the first spade flung the cold winter clods drumming on the box lid and if she was crying I would not have known it , with the rain on all of our faces . Aunt Sarah 's face was without remorse or sorrow or any emotion except for her eyes , which as always betrayed her , and they were full of the tenderness against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Uncle Joe stood with his blind eyes reaching to the rain , his head cocked and a half-smile on his lips , listening , as he often seemed to be , for some voice close by . Suse and Toot and old Coy stood bedraggled and sodden before the ritual , showing unashamedly that old primal awe which each of the rest of us felt and yet masked with feelings wholly different . And suddenly it was done and earth had claimed her and was leveled again and just as abruptly , as if at a signal , the rain stopped and the sky broke open into blue patches and small gusts of breeze ; the children of yesterday 's long , cold wind gamboled among us . And everybody began trudging down the sloshy ruts for home . Everybody , that is , but Cathie and I who , unaccountably , had been forgotten in the aftermath . The air was nippy and sharp with a keen white tooth of winter still in it but now the whole panoply of sky had scattered and across the keen winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon like westering boats . Cathie stood a few paces away at the rim of  | the mound of fresh earth but she had turned away and was starting off toward the river far beyond the toy meadow beneath the hill . I walked to her with feet heavy with mud and confusion and stood still , trying to guess her expression behind the bonnet rim . And presently she spoke out . I just hate her , she said , and I leaned around and saw her face then , pinched and raging . Who ? Her ! Her ! she gasped , gesturing woodenly toward the grave and weeping now , sobbing , unabashed and shaking with it . Aunt Rebecca ! You must n't say that ! I said softly , staring at the mound and the cheap country flowers . I do ! I do ! Why ? I whispered and my eyes went a-wandering among the stony names and the dates and the sandy angels with their dreadful , beckoning cherub hands . She was awful ! Abijah would have been so ashamed ! Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the songs she sang ! Awful awful awful ! And the way she  --  she looked in the coffin there ! Did n't you see how awful she looked ? How  --  common ! Nobody looks good when they 're dead . Some people , she cried , are beautiful ! My mother was beautiful when she was dead ! Not old and ugly  --  like a servant ! And I had no heart nor word to answer that ; I who had called them that . Go away ! she raged at me , and my eyes wandered to the stones again and I saw the name of my mother and father and wondered if they listened in their ancient room beneath the roof of grass . Go away ! she wailed . Just leave us be here for a while ! Her and me ! Go back to your big house , Thomas Christopher ! You and your Aunt Sarah and your Uncle Joe and your slaves ! Leave the servants be ! And I was glad to go and wandered down to the house and went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening for her to come back and just at dusk she rapped softly at the kitchen window and Toot let her in and I heard her creep to the little room that was all hers now .  | WHEN I was very small the house of Dulcie Curtis was a place I swore to live when I was a man and could come and go as I pleased , without Aunt Sarah 's by-your-leave . Once , I had been there , when I was five , and had come away wide-eyed and clammy-handed with wonder , my mind twinkling with the vision of that candy box of a front room in Dulcie 's house : a spotless , shuttered chamber within which the light of day sifted so dim that it seemed always late pleasant afternoon there and at night when the lamps were lighted the air grew golden as pollen and caught its breath and shone green and soft like a forest in the sea . Dulcie and her brother Willie had lived all their days in that house . Willie had gone off when he was seventeen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson in those days and had come back to the bottomlands as fine a doctor as we , or anyone else , could ask and settled down with a genteel and resigned smile and commenced to drink peach brandy . He had never stopped that , nor his medicine either , and it was the custom in the bottomlands when a woman was quick with child and her burden awoke from its dream at last and began to stir , that they would come fetch Willie Curtis and hold him prisoner a week before the confinement so that his lean , cunning fingers would be fit for the task . There was about him  --  however thick-tongued with drink he might be  --  an unvarying and unfailing gentility of a breed antique and extinct in these brusque times . In the summer he wore a white linen suit and a white shirt and black string tie and under his white mustache he thoughtfully sucked on a clove from Dulcie 's spice cabinet so as not to offend the bigoted and faint of heart . In the winter he wore a gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | his pockets for small sick children . Aunt Sarah could not abide his habits but his manners flattered her and since he was the only doctor between Christopher 's Landing and Elizabethtown he had to do . As for myself I adored him and when he would lower the quilt to thump my poor chest , rasping with my every breath like a broken harmonium , he would tell me to listen while he beat the rhythm slow and dark as he had heard the drums of the First Virginia Infantry on the sad day when he was my age and General Washington had been laid in his vaulted tomb and even the black crows wheeling and scrawing in the sky had seemed to grieve . I think in his squashy black bag he only carried three bottles of pills : three , mind you , for a world of ills , for a universe sick and gasping and on its knees , close to its end . There was the blue pill for physic , the yellow pill for fever , and brown one , I suppose , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . Three pills for all of life 's ills and in the sagging , baggy pocket of his alpaca coat the bottle which was the cure for his own ; the heart 's death and some odd , broken dream that we all , like as not , would have laughed to hear . And though Aunt Sarah would not stand in the room when he came to thump my breast or grieve hopelessly over Uncle Joe 's imagined cholera ; though she would recoil at the breath of him that was always sweet and volatile like a cellar of peaches in hot August , so thick sometimes that you could almost hear the singing of a golden wasp beneath his shirt , it was his sister Dulcie that she would not countenance . Dulcie had married a man named Charley Lindsay , fifty years before , and it was said of her that she married him because he had not a hair on his chest and had the sweetest voice in ten counties of Virginia . Charley was as loud as a rouster , as fat as a boar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the valley who had not had to listen to his accounts of epic and bloody fist fights in the old river days and yet there was not a man living in our county to whom he had ever raised his voice in anger , much less his fist . They were without issue , he and Dulcie , and when they had been married ten years Charley suddenly commenced taking the mare off every Friday evening and not returning till long past nine . Dulcie followed him on foot one night , a long four-mile journey down that dusk-yellow river road , and watched behind a small grove of plum trees while Charley entered the house of a woman named Cynthie Cox . After a few moments , D ulcie stole to the window of the parlor and peering inside saw her husband and Cynthie Cox playing euchre on a drop-leaf table . She  | said nothing and after a few weeks followed him again and peered in the same window and saw the same quiet spectacle . And it had gone on that way for thirty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even when he had forgotten one night and called her Cynthie in the starshine of their pillow . And when , at last , Charley Lindsay died in an apoplectic seizure on the courthouse steps at Elizabethtown when the final result of the election of Tyler was nailed to the oak tree , Dulcie had taken the buggy down river to the house of Cynthie Cox and introduced herself and they had sat there and cried for a while and had tea and cried some more and a week later Cynthie came to live at Dulcie 's house . To Aunt Sarah and , for that matter , to most of the decent women in the bottoms this seemed the blackest scandal since Eden  --  mistress and widow under the same roof . Yet each had loved him , each had wondered at his strangeness , each knew the ultimate joke that Providence had played them and it seemed , I think , that something pleased them in the way it had come out in the end . I doubt if his name was ever mentioned between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pathetic memento of him in the parlor or bedroom and ask whether it should be thrown out or not . In the end , I suppose , all of him was thrown out , memory and shoes and beaver hat , until at last there survived between these two women only a sweet , mute kinship of understanding and a secret laughter at Life which had not let either of them know the love of man . Spinsters they were , in fact . Spinsters to see , certainly : sweet and spotless in black taffeta dickies and with bonnets perpetually on their heads : old bonnets like limp marigolds whose petals cupped round their dusty white faces . It seems to me that there was always something of filigreed gold and polished jet about their throats , always a scent of cedar about their clothes with a breath of tansy from their pantry still clinging to them . Cynthie was small-voiced and genteel and Dulcie was delicate as a needle but blunt and outspoken as a man . A cat , she had been heard to remark to Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk a mile to piss on parsley ! And Uncle Joe would tell this to make Aunt Sarah sniff and purse her face and go off angry into the kitchen and leave him be . For she could not countenance them and the house of Dulcie was a place she would not let me go when I was small . Though the spring I turned thirteen I went where I pleased and Cathie came , too , for in those years since the death of Rebecca some new and somehow frightened  | kinship had grown between us . She was now eleven and tough as a boy and in the summers she would reach August as brown as I was and her legs would be scratched and torn by the same wild-berry thorns that laced my own and we would race through the fields and meadow by day and sometimes by the light of moon , like the wild children of the fox . Sometimes , ravening with thirst in the shimmer glass of a blinding August afternoon , we would come up the hill , through the cemetery , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold drinks with some sort of fruit syrup she had made and kept in a cool stone jar beneath the pump and we would move cautiously like quivering horses through the delicate half-light of her little parlor , our flanks twitching with carefulness not to knock against the spidery legs of a tiny table , or the bellied glass of her souvenir cabinet , or the bell-jar with the tiny boat . And when we had had our poundcake and our cold drink in the parlor of Dulcie and heard Cynthie play Mister Foster 's tunes on the harmonium we would race out again onto the hill , bound again for home or to the woods again to see if the redbird whose nest we had found that morning had come back again to its eggs . What bound us together in those years was a thing so totally unlike the first year that the death of Rebecca seemed a gateway between those two worlds of darkness and light . In that time Abijah had written two letters from Kansas and she carried them with her always in the pocket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would let me hold them and read them again . The first letter spoke of the death of Rebecca . The second told us that he had joined the cavalry of a gentleman named Morgan in Kentucky and that he would come back by and by . And it was clear , although he did not mention it again , that when he came he would he a King and riding proud , in scarlet , and with silver pistols in his belt . Because that had always been her dream and in those years , strangely and magically , it had come to be my own and she had shared it with me like the warmth of a home hearth . I could hardly remember the bitterness of that first winter now and , often , in my dreams I would see the vision of him : high and lofty on a frothing mare , a man higher than the sycamore by the north fence , a giant printed on the sky . And yet sometimes , although we were inseparable , I would feel a sudden , choking rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentments seem like the paleness of a star beside the moon . We were together from breakfast till  | Aunt Sarah snuffed out every lamp and yet there were times when we would find one another caught up in a sudden trivial incident and a moment later would be standing , toe to toe , lashing at each other 's face with fingers or stones or whatever happened to be at hand . Things came too easy for her ; I could not forgive her that . She rode like a highwayman  --  she could bring down a bird with a stone no bigger than her thumbnail  --  she could swim deeper and more swiftly than I. And once when we stole Willie Curtis 's johnboat and went clean out to mid-channel and stood in the very path of the morning packet to Sunfish as it came churning toward us , she had dived when it swept past and disappeared beneath it and I gasped and prayed and was sure she would come up broken and bleeding in the wake of its paddle wheel but she had done the incredible feat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and bobbed now in the churning spindrift of the blowing river wind , her hair streaming in her mocking eyes and her red mouth taunting me till I bit the blood out of my own tongue in envy and outrage . She never mentioned her Aunt Rebecca once in all those years and one time when our day 's fortunes had taken us by chance through the graven stones on the hill by Dulcie 's house I had caught her hand and held her and stared down for a moment at the stone above that mound that the grass and stars-of-Bethlehem had covered now : the name already worn by the ceaseless fingers of the rain : " Rebecca Hornbrook  --  Born 179o  --  Died 1855 ? Night winds , night winds blowing leaves in heaps  --  Fall gently over the grave where Rebecca sleeps . " And she had suddenly clenched her fingers and bent my thumb back till I squealed shamefully and tore it free , and I saw the hate and dread in her eyes before she sprang off and raced me to the road . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepers  --  and I never hit her that day for bending my thumb because it was a justice . I 'm going to cut my hair off ! she said to me one day when we were stripping to swim in the river . You 'd never ! I would ! she cried and her voice echoed in the grove of willows and a bird climbed , startled , and cried across the sky . Because that 's how your Aunt Sarah knows when we 've been swimming ! And she shed her camisole and the rest of the incongruous female frippery that Aunt Sarah bedecked her in ( she had grown unaccountably fond of her in those last two years ) and stood glaring out at the river ,  | hugging her brown arms round her chest , the sunlight twinkling like tiny fires on the fine down of her thighs . Then I can dive all I please ! she said . And she 'll never know . But even the thought of this forbidding seemed to enrage her and , wet hair or no , she suddenly arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river shoals below . I watched her far beneath it , far down in the very depths of it where the sunfish broke and scattered like chips of pearl before her naked slimness and I felt my temples pound with anger . She was a better diver than I and could stay down for a length of time that brought me to the surface with aching ears and a nose full of green water . I stood and watched her surface and claw her dark hair back and mock me again with her eyes . He taught me to swim , she shouted . Who ? I cried , and dove off the bluff and struck the water like a falling chair and sank tumbling heel over ears and came up choking . Abijah taught me ! she laughed . When I was only three he threw me off the Nellie Queen and told me I 'd have to swim or drown . And I swam ! I taught myself , I said , and it was the glummest , dullest fact in the world . Damme ! she swore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's just what I 'm going to do . Stop swearing , I said , or I 'll tell Aunt Sarah ! I do n't care , she said . Abijah used to swear something wonderful ! That 's no matter , I said . You heard Jamey Toomey , the old scissorsharpener , say " damme " that day in the back yard and you just say it to be smart . I used that word long before ! she cried . Damme ! Abijah used to say that all the time ! That 's a lie ! You just say it to be smart because you heard him say it and you know Aunt Sarah wo n't let Jamey sharpen our knives any more . She dove again , heedless , and was gone , and I ducked under and saw her whiteness loping like a far , ghostly porpoise in the murky shoals and then I swallowed water and came up gasping . She was nowhere in sight and I knew that she was teasing again , trying to scare me , trying to make me think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see bubbles rising , mocking bubbles that broke and each held a small laughter . In the end I always grew frightened  | at the trick and just at the moment when I would imagine that at last she had really gone down in trouble I would hear her laughter behind me and there was never time for me to turn before she thrust me under and turned me over and then scrambled up on the bank before I could get my hands on her . Sometimes in the wild sweetness of those days we would go solemnly to the beached boat of Abijah on the sandy bar where he had left it and there was no mocking or struggle in us then : we went fingers-linked and dumb with shared pride , like pilgrims , to some barbaric ivory temple in the wilderness . She is very beautiful , she would say after a spell of looking . Is n't she ! The Nellie Queen ! She sure is . Prettier than the Zachary Taylor ! Pooh ! That old shantyboat ! And once while we had stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one small moment of glory : I had spied a copperhead not a hand 's length from her bare toes and I had killed it . Then she kissed my cheeks like a general and promised that when Abijah came he would make me first mate of the Nellie Queen . A thousand nights in her pantry had made us canny of Toot 's teasing . She did not find us such easy game in these wiser years . One night when Cathie had taken an apple from the box and Toot saw her she told her that it was the snaky apple she had chosen . Sho ! said Toot . And de way you just grab and pick it out the fust time shows that you got the makin 's of mischief within you already ! Shoot ! Gwan ! Eat a bite , Li'l Miss Evie ! And den give some to poh Adam sittin ' yonder ! And then just see the trouble come switchin ' round you like de snake of damnation ! Cathie glared at the apple a moment and then bit it so angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juice of it spurted round her nostrils . There ! she cried when she had chewed it and gulped it down . I ate a bite ! Here , Tom ! I took it and ate a bite , smaller than hers , to show that I was not afraid , and watched her whirl on Toot . See there ! she cried . Nothing happened . I 'm the same ! So 's Tom ! You think you the same ! sniffed Toot . But just wait till temptation comes through de grass !  | Pshaw ! Sho ! You 'll see ! Hit 'll come a-wrigglin ' directly . But we never believed it and we ate the White Kirklands and the Canada Reds from Aunt Sarah 's cellar as much as we pleased and sin never came a-wriggling at all . Not right away , at least . Not that there was no Sin already abroad in that time ; not that there was not trouble enough astir like thunder coiled in the thick . tir of that summer . It was the season of the ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bothersome . Their legions trickled into every corner of the house . They found their way somehow into the most close-capped honey pot ; they tracked in thin , gl ittering ranks through the dust in the yard : ants moving in nervous , closed phalanx up and down the smooth boles of the fruit trees and the windfallen fruit was pitted with their small ravaging . And Toot knew the wherefore of this strangeness , too . Sho ! she exclaimed one morning , dashing them from the window sill with an angry hand . De ants knows ! Knows what ? said Cathie . Knows de evil of de times ! cried Toot . When de ants goes to marchin ' ? mens will be marchin ' soon ! Pshaw ! Hit 's a Pack ! It 's wrote plain in de Book ! It was a dark prophecy and her flesh seemed quivering with it and neither of us mocked her for that ; it seemed more than just a teasing . And there were other portents . Aunt Sarah sometimes tore the Wheeling Argus to bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Carly juniper 's General Store men who had once muttered , shouted at one another now , and fists were raised and sometimes on the courthouse steps at Elizabethtown derringers were cocked in warning and pepperboxes barked when all patience was lone . In the fall of that year a band of men from Kansas came to our very dominion and seized the arsenal at Harper 's Ferry and were hanged for their trouble . And though she never talked of it , I think Cathie knew that somewhere in the broil of it all Abijah stood strong and ready and that in the resolution of it he would find his birthright and come back at last . Though it had been a year since his last letter . And that troubled her , I think , and she seemed irritable that summer . But that , I guess , was mostly because she was growing so fast . She was sprouted up t lean to the tip of my nose now and lean and hard as a willow wand  | and in that strange summer a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find her often staring moodily off into the river wind or alone in the top of a tree in Uncle Joe 's orchard with a half-eaten pear in her hand , and when I spoke to her she would look at me dumbly and then look at the fruit as if she wondered how it had come to be there and wonder whose teeth had spooned out its tart sweet flesh in that bitten place . Sometimes she would stop speaking in the middle of a sentence and it would almost seem that she were listening to remote voices . What 's wrong , Cathie ? Nothing ! Nothing ! Let me alone ! You 're sure different these days ! You must be sick with growing pains or something ! Sometimes she would fight me for a word like that , come rushing at me with her face livid and drawn with unspeakable spite and we would tumble to the sward of buttercups in a tangle of mad limbs , our fingers striving for each other 's hair and the breath of us mingling in numb , furious strife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all and move off and sit alone somewhere or go and devil Suse or Toot in the pantry or sew with Aunt Sarah in the north room . And then in that September a thing came to pass that seemed to quicken her fever all the more . We had walked all the way to Carly Juniper 's store to buy licorice and a spool of green thread for Aunt Sarah and were easing homeward . Just as we rounded the clump of pawpaws by the road at the corner of our fence we both spied the man on the bay stallion cantering toward us . I heard Cathie 's quick sob and I think for a moment she thought it was Abijah and we both began to run toward the rider as if we knew that it was us he had come for . Hi ! he cried , reining up when we were abreast of him . Are you Catherine Ellen Hornbrook , madam ? Yes ! I am ! He 's not ! Well now , I would n't reckon that feller yonder would have a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a friend of Abijah 's ? Hold on now , madam ! Do n't get wild ! My name is Frank Seton and I 'm lieutenant in Morgan 's Kentucky Rifles ! Is Abijah all right ! Fine , fit , and full of fight ! Where is he ?  | Hit do n't matter where . You could n't go to him now if you was a mind to , and he 'll not be back home for a spell . When I told him I was ridin ' up the river to Wheeling to see a lady he asked me to stop ? . Have you got a letter from him ? That 'll wait . Let me finish . Lord , you 're his all right  --  there 's the same brimstone smell when you speak a while ! He 's fine , as I 've already said , and he sends you his blessings and his love and says he prays to God for you ever ' night and asks you to do him the same favor . God knows he 'll need them prayers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heared , daughter ? Do n't newspapers git back this far in the country ? Ai n't there enough steamboat talk to keep you farmers posted ? There 's a war comin ' ! War ! she whispered and the word blew soft like a wind through her . Yes , a war ! Sho , he said . A real war ! And soon , I allow ! Soon ! He was dressed for a war , I thought , and stared in dumbstruck love at his knee-high boots shiny and wrinkled as prunes and his fine gray wool suit and the pistol in his belt as long as from my elbow to my little-finger tip . Sho , he said again , staring off up river . A right smart of a war ! But we 're feeling up to it ! And Abijah will lead them ! she cried suddenly , bringing her palms together with a soft clap , and threw her head back with that light in her face . Well now ! cried the man in gray . I do n't know about that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But he 'll be in the thick ! Do n't worry ' bout Bige Hornbrook . He said to give you this , said Frank Seton and reached in his shirt under the gold buttons of his gray jacket and fetched out a piece of midday summer sun . He held it down to her , swinging on a gold chain as gossamer-thin as spider 's silk . Cathie took it , breathless , and cupped it in her palms , the locket with the feathers scratched on it and the looped chain coiled like a golden hair . It 's Mama 's locket ! she breathed . He carried it with him every-where ! Well , he bade me give it to you and tell you to keep holt of it till he gets back ! When ?  | The man in gray laughed : a sound like the soft breaking of a rifle and looked down at us both , smiled down at us . Sho , he said . I know the answer to that like I know the day of Armageddon . He grinned and fetched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jawed it a minute and then looked at us again with his strange , quiet , violent face . Morgan says it 'll be over and done by the spring of ' Sixty-one , he said with a soft chuckle . But I reckon the Lord will measure the time of it  --  not Morgan nor me nor even yore Daddy , Catherine Ellen , madam ! War ! she breathed again as if the word ran like a soothing thing upon her tongue . Sho ! said the gray man and caught up his reins again . But it 's good-by now . There 's a lady in Wheelin ' ? . Good-by ! she said and ' bit her lip , scowling , as if she knew there were something she must tell him : something about a King . But she kept her peace and he smiled again and tipped his hat and bowed a little in the saddle and then his black heel flashed in the stallion 's flank and the hooves sprang up in a thunder and they were gone in dust and a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by herself to the shade of the pawpaws with her back to me . I knew she was prying open the tiny gold shell of the locket to stare inside and when I crept up behind her to look too , she clapped it shut in her hands and whirled on me . I just detest a sneak and a spy ! she cried , stamping her foot in the dust . Why ca n't I see ? Because it 's a special locket ! That 's why ! It 's my mother 's picture and it was hand-painted by a genuine Spanish artist and it 's just for me and Abijah to look at ! It was too near suppertime for us to , have a fight so I walked off indifferently , kicking my bare toe in the dust and watching a toad thumping off ahead of me a dozen yards or so . I 'll bet she 's ugly , I said . Just like a hop-toad ! And she chased me to the house for that and I ran ahead of her through the long meadow laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and up the stars and latched the door to my room and she hammered on the old wood until Aunt Sarah came and yelled at her to stop .  | Tom , unlatch that door this minute ! Yes 'm . Toot said there was a rider on the road ! I said nothing and Cathie shook her head with wondrous bewilderment and looked Aunt Sarah square in the eye . I declare ! Cathie sighed . That Toot is the blackest liar in all creation . Indeed ! Then what she said ai n't so ? Why , no ! laughed Cathie in wide-eyed surprise and kept the locket in the hands she had laced behind her . I could have sworn I heard hooves ! Well , no matter . You know what I 've told you children about talkin ' to strangers on the road . Yes 'm , we said together . Then remember it ! There 's gypsies abroad in the land and they steal children ! Remember that ! They steal children and sell them for slaves in Egypt ! Would you like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved that . All right . Now go wash for supper . The both of you . And get clean all the way to the elbows . And , Tom , put on your shoes too ! And we went to the pump and washed and I thought that I would die if she did n't show me the locket soon . It had seemed to me in those months that Abijah was as much my own dream as hers and it was wicked of her to keep this glory from me . The thick , bunched heat of the day broke at twilight in a wild river storm and we sat after supper in the kitchen listening to the drip of the rain and the far-off rumble of the retreating thunder . You tol ' Miz Christopher a lie , you scallawags ! We never did ! cried Cathie . Sho you did ! said Toot . I seen dat man on de horse plain as you see me hyer ! You 're always seeing things ! said Cathie scornfully . Toot fell silent then , muttering from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crinkled in worry as if misdoubting that a body could believe their eyes at all in that strange time , when ants marched like the tragic legions of the world 's benighted men and when summer thunder upon the far-away ridges sounded more and more like the gathering fury of an outraged god . It was an hour after the rain stopped that the clouds were gone  | and a thin moon lay curled in my window and when the owl began to blow its soft grieving flute in the orchard I heard her tap on my door . The house was long abed and I knew it could be none but her and yet I cried out the whispered challenge as if I feared that it might not be a mortal at all . It 's me ! And she opened the door , knowing how to bear down and swing it with a little swift push so that the brass hinge would not speak . She was standing there in her long nightdress like a pleasant ghost with her dark hair in pigtails down either shoulder , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hand . You can look , she whispered when she had come to my bedside , and I tore out of the quilt and took it gently from her fingers . Careful you do n't break the chain , she whispered . Here , let me open it ! It 's very hard to do ! And she took it and her hair fell over her hands as she bent and plucked the tiny lid loose with her fingernail and then held it out in the patch of moon for me to see . That 's her , she said softly . Nellie . Abijah 's beautiful Nellie . I took it and saw it in my own hand and felt a little of the shared love of it flow into my fingers : the magic of that tiny , oval face with the frame of dark , wooden hair and the sad smiling mouth . Is n't she beautiful ? Like a queen ! That 's why Abijah called his boat after her . The Nellie Queen . You can see why  --  ca n't you ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is surely a belle ! She crawled up on the quilt and tucked her feet under her nightdress and sighed happily , holding her hand out to take the locket back . But I could not let it go just yet : there was a magic in it that warmed something cold in me . Do n't keep it too long , she said gently . All right , I said . Here . And I gave it back and suddenly I knew that I had to lie to her and as soon as the lie rose to my lips it magically became a truth . I told you once that I could n't remember my mother , I said . Yes . Well , that ai n't so , I said . I was just making that up . I mind her very well . Yes , but you said ? . I know . The reason I said that was because I knew your mother was dead and I did n't want to make you feel bad . I did n't want to  | bragging on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do ! I do ! Sure , I said . I never knew that then ! Now I know and it 's all right to tell you ! My mother 's only been dead about five years , you see ! I 've been here nearly that long ! she said frowning . And you said ? . Well maybe it was six years , I said , wallowing desperately through these thick , deep waters . A body loses track of time . Tom , she said softly . You seem to forget sometimes that we 're friends  --  close friends ! You do n't have to lie to me ! Stop saying I 'm a liar ! I whispered fiercely , bunching up my fist to hit her . My mother was beautiful ! I remember ! I remember ! Tom ! Tom , do n't start fighting now ! Please ! Oh , Tom , I 'm so happy'tonight ! The news from Abijah and everything . I pouted , glum and wounded , and would not look at her . And there 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trance of happiness . A War , Tom ! And Abijah will win  --  he 'll be the one to lead them and then he 'll be King . And for that matter , I said , I happen to remember my father very well , too . He looked just like that man on horseback today ! Tom ! Well , I do ! Tom , why do you make up stories ! Our being friends has n't got anything to do with that ! Ca n't you understand ? We 're both of us alone ? ! And when I thrust out both hands and struck her in the chest she gawped and gasped and fell back on the quilt and did not move and I crawled over and stared down in her face . I had thought that there would be a fight and Aunt Sarah would hear us and come and find her there and it would be her that would get the licking , not me , because it was her that was out of bed and prowling the house . But she lay very still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep into her lower lip and there was a gold brimming of tears in her lashes . What 's wrong ? I whispered , shaking her shoulder . Did I hurt you ? She nodded , a fast quick motion of her head and I saw her clenched hands and the tears shook loose from her lashes and trickled down her cheeks . And I think they were not so much tears of pain as they were of shame that she had not fought me.  | I 'm sorry , I said , and hated myself for the weakness of that . She lay a while longer and then sat up suddenly and dug at her eyes with the heels of her hands and sniffled haughtily . I think I hurt my chest swimming yesterday forenoon , she said , and snuffled , not looking at me . It hurts lately . Your chest hurts ? She nodded , still with her eyes in the moon and the tree that had caught it and whose branches now relinquished it like opening , reluctant fingers which could hold it back no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , she said with an angry snuffle . When we fight . What ? About my chest , she said a little wistfully . If you want to hurt me now  --  you know how , Tom Christopher ! just hit me in the chest ! I wo n't , I said after a while and wished she would let me look at Abijah 's locket a little while more . Why not ? she said . It 's fair . When you fight someone you can hit them anywhere ! That 's fair ! I 'm not asking any special favors ! I made no reply because I knew that fighting with her in those last few weeks had not been any good : there was something wrong with her and maybe something wrong with me as well . Fighting her was no fun any more because there was a softness gathering silently beneath her skin in those months and when you hit her it was soft , it did not feel right . And after a while there in the moonlight I did n't even want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or perhaps because she let me hold the locket again to stare silently at that haunting tiny face upon the oval of ivory , dusted with the antiquity of that summer moonlight and I kept it there in my hand and she did not quarrel with me to give it back until I was ready . And when the owl began faintly chuckling again in the orchard I think it frightened us both and she took it back and kissed my cheek and stole softly into the darkness again . And there was this strangeness common to her and to myself and to the season : a hush before the raging . Once I found her , after a whole day 's search , in my old haunts , in the crown of the roof , atop the world : squatting bony-kneed and desolate on the naked , harsh rafters that had been laid there in my Grandfather 's time . All I could see in that whistling , empty darkness was the shape of her  | face : watched it turn slowly from the chink of steaming daylight to shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my head and shoulders in the open square above the ladder . What do you want ? Nothin ' . She said nothing and the white of her face slid to half moon and then to none and I knew her eye was back at the peephole through which only the pure of heart might spy upon the universe . She would have none of me . Go away , she whispered , dispassionately , after a spell . What 's wrong , Cathie ? She was still , and my eyes , accustomed now to the shapes of things in that darkness , saw how she held the old bird 's nest cupped in her hands . Well , she said after a while . There is something wrong , Thomas , since you ask . And I just might as well tell you . What ? I whispered , and thought about the bird 's nest and of how , if I were a bird , I would come back betimes to visit the round , gentle place of my birth . It 's just that you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken sob , and I knew that she would have dropped the bird 's nest now so that she could clench her fists for strength against sobs , against showing herself to me at all . That 's not so . It is , too ! It is ! You 've always been against me ! You and your Aunt Sarah and even your Uncle Joe . The only ones that were ever nice to me in my whole livelong life were my Aunt Rebecca and she 's gone to glory ? ! Cathie , I ? . ? and maybe Miss Dulcie and Miss Cynthie and Doctor Willie ! They 're nice to me and when you say something to them they do n't turn up their noses at your every little thing ! I declare , Tom , sometimes I wish it was me instead of Aunt Rebecca up there under the grass ! Cathie , do n't say that ! The Lord might hear ! Let Him ! she cried . If God is listening right now I 'm not ashamed to have Him hear me say sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I squinted some ; faint before the thunder sure to come : the smiting of us both to dust , gray , faint child-dust that would swirl  | and blow among the timbers of that high place in lean-fanged winter nights , among those rafters which might , for all I knew , comprise the floor of vengeful heaven itself : dust to sift among the old loved twigs of the birds ' unremembered nursery . I clambered up and walked toe-to-heel along a timber to where she was . Let me look , I said . I ai n't looked for months ! And she sighed and moved away and left a warm shape of girlsmell in the air where she had brooded so long and I put my eye to the chink of wind-blown light in the broken slates . The whole world , I whispered . My , it sure is a grand view ! Yes , she said . That one word told me she had revived a little from her funk and I fanned the flame hopefully . Look away off yonder there ! I cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting brush-filth ! That 's not all , she said softly . There 's a way to hold your eye to that hole so 's you can see ? . No , I wo n't tell you . I 'll make you find it ! What ? Where ? Some days you ca n't see it  --  when there 's a misty rain  --  or when there 's fog you ca n't see it at all ! Today you can though . Most always when there 's ' a clear wind you can ! Yes ! Abijah 's boat ! Yes ! The Nellie Queen ! Yes ! Yes ! I cried . Beautiful ! Beautiful ! That 's why I come up here mostly ! It just ? it just restoreth my soul ! I know ! Like it says in the Book ! She rose and tiptoed away proud and mean and happy again ; walked straight with her narrow , naked feet unerring and smooth along the rafter to the square that led to the ladder . And I followed her , dumb and thick-tongued with beholden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make or ruin me after all . Since it was past five it was all right for us to take the roan and we climbed her firm rump and rode bareback into the south wind , the mare 's hooves beating a muffled , proud drum in the dust of the river road . I rode to forward and she clung behind , her  | hard arms round me and her breath gasping in my ear , all the way to the place . Sometime ! she cried boldly , springing down to the stones , her face flushed and shameless with the pleasure of the wide-legged riding . Sometime let 's fetch a cord of wood from home and fill the boilers and get up just enough head of steam to blow the whistle once ! No , I said . Aunt Sarah would n't let us have stove wood ! There 's wood up in the thickets yonder on the hill ! Yes , but it 's still wet from the rain . Some day in September when it 's dried out maybe ! Just wait ! she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her whistle , Tom ! Abijah used to say it was like a choir of mockingbirds ! Yes , I thought , as I followed her up the stage plank . We 'll blow that whistle : that choir of mockingbirds one day shall sing out to the land . It was not more than four hundred yards down Fish Creek to the mouth of it and the sycamores and willows on either side framed it : the river beyond , coursing heavy and majestic and on any day , in those times , one could stand there and , in a single afternoon , witness the stately passage of a dozen lacy , white packets , like proud swans on their way to Cincinnati or Louisville . Let me be pilot this time ! No , me ! No . That 's not fair . I was leadsman last time . Then be forward watch ! That 's no fun . That 's a nigger 's job . Well so 's leadsman . I know but it 's dangerous . Let me be pilot this time . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Indian up  --  I get to be pilot ! she cried , and her eyes were laughing already : she always won . And the red coin spun in the sun and splattered on my hand-heel and the dark chief mocked me and she darted gangle-legged up the companionway to the pilot house and tucked her cropped hair into Abijah 's old blue cap and stood framed in the giant spokes of that vast mahogany wheel while I waded , ruefully , into the shallows . Yet even in this there was a sweetness that caught my very heart : wading there , waist-deep , in the shoals beyond the Nellie Queen 's bow , now rank and green-glistening with sumac and creepers , and squinting  | my eyes till my lashes blurred the light of day and conjured it into fog : the swirling mists of a desperate night and I , the black leadsman , held the boat 's safety in my fingers ' cunning . In my imagined skiff I would make my way cautiously to a distance of twelve feet off her starboard bow and hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oars , while I dandled my leadline into the treacherous depths . It was a glory but it was a solemn doing : we were never closer to our gods than then . It was not playing : it was ritual and salvation and a praying-time . Half tw-ain ! And I would hear her shrill voice chant out response , and would wade on , heaving my leadline cautiously . Quarter less ta-ree ! I would sing . Dreaming then , yes dreaming of nights in the thick blood of summer heat when the channel shallowed to treacherous limits and I had heard the Zachary Taylor feel her way like a blind peddler down to Powhatan through mists as thick as the inside of a cotton bale and heard Captain Dohrman 's bell clang hotly at those black scallawags in the leadsman 's skiff . Mark ta-ree ! A singing to it : a ghost of a voice as old as river , as old as scritch and rasp of frogs beneath the willows , and the locusts sawing down the last tottering legs of summer under the green dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quarter ta-ree ! When I opened my eyes wide the magic had become so thick and rich that it was still that night and I would chant the old thing Coy remembered his dead brother singing  --  Judah , the octoroon who had gone up with the Chickasaw when her black diamond boilers blew one night off Memphis in the dead of Christmas Eve : " Captain , Captain , do n't you think I 'm sly ! ? Goin ' to do my leadin ' and keep my leadline dry ! " And when the boat was safely through and heading huffy with triumph , her wheels churning green water like a queen 's white lace wake , we 'd sit on the rocks on shore a while and brood and listen to the locusts tune themselves up for evening . And yet even in the sweetness and high province of our ritual there in the great boat something was gone . Something had left us that summer : like the birds had fled the old nest in the attic and there was in us both that despair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks  | and clay and hope . Something had gone out of us and it was a gap between two phases of us each : like the old of the moon . The tried joys seemed failing and the incantations of pagan infancy seemed to have ceased in summoning up the ghosts we loved . What 's wrong with you ? What ? You just sit there and kick that pinching bug with your toe ! she said , and presently : Let 's go home . No , I said . Let 's go to Dulcie 's house . All right , she said . You 're the one who always says we must n't go to Dulcie 's house ! Aunt Sarah do n't allow it . Well then why do you want to go there now ? You 're right , I sighed . We better had n't . She stood awhile , her eyes smoky with a strangeness . She 'd whip us , she said . Yes , she 'd whip us if she ever knew we went there . But that 's all she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not . I did n't make fun of Him ! That 's what sacrilege means ! I just said your Aunt Sarah was not Him . And she 's not . She clambered onto the mare 's rump behind me and dug her knuckles into my ribs and rested her pouting , brooding lip on my shoulder . Anyway , she whispered . Everybody knows God 's no old woman . He 's a man . And I held my tongue at that because another word of argument and we would have tangled and gone a-pitching into the ditch and that would have been an end to it all , with only a frothing , whiteryed mare prancing at Aunt Sarah 's gate , snorting the tale of our deaths . She was there , as it was , biting her tongue with outrage for she had found the pile of curls and the already rusted sheep-shearers under the puzzle bush behind the smoke house where , that morning , Cathie had cropped her hair to the shoulders . March yonder to the house , Missy ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the kitchen door stuffing her apron in her mouth and wheezing with wild mirth at the sight of the hair shorn ragged as a cropped mane . Sho now ! Hai n't she a sight fo ' God !  | Hush up , Toot ! Catherine Ellen ! Did you cut your hair ? Yes 'm . Did Tom help you ? No 'm . I did it every bit myself . And mighty proud of your handiwork I can see ! And brazen to boot ! And lookin ' like a hussy from Sodom 's alleys ! Sho now ? ! Hush , Toot ! Git back in the kitchen , you old fool , and hush ! Cathie stood stick-straight and chin-high , still flushed and shortbreathed from the ride and dark eyes twinkling , squarely staring into Aunt Sarah 's wrathful spectacles . Go indoors ! The both of you ! Get yonder into the pantry ! She came behind us and shut the door and latched it against the bald-eyed amusement of the Negro women and fetched a handful of switches from the corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his million eyes wild with yearning for the sun beyond . Why did you cut your hair off ? Because . She looked away then and her eyes were scared for a flash and then her mouth squared and she turned back to Aunt Sarah . Because it 's my hair , she said gravely . Ah , because it 's your hair . And you think you may do with yourself as you please ? I hated it , she breathed , the soft flesh beneath her eye curling at the thought . Sometimes I just hate being a girl at all . But it has been so ordained , said Aunt Sarah . By God who knows His own reasons that you have a woman 's full hair . I know ! I know ! she cried bitterly . I was born a girl ! I 'll aways be ! Yes , she said . Female created He and Male . And you would fight against His ordaining . I ca n't help it ! I still wish it sometimes ! Girls ca n't  --  girls are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah . In a year you will be a woman , Catherine Ellen . Do you know that ? Yes , she breathed , and the word moaned like a small one-sounded tune . You had beautiful hair , Catherine Ellen ! Look at it ! She held out the tumbling dark curls of it  --  the smoky , tumbling coils like thick ropes of night .  | I still hate it , she whispered . I 'm glad I cut my hair off ! Then I must punish you , said Aunt Sarah . If you kneel here at my knee and pray God to forgive you for what you did  --  you and Tom may go . If you ask Him to pardon you your mockery of His will  --  to forgive your willfulness ! No . No , I wo n't . Because I 'm not sorry . You 're old , Catherine Ellen Hornbrook , said Aunt Sarah , lifting the hem of Cathie 's skirts to bare her pale , scarred calves for the switch . And big to be whipped . But I 'd not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind you and take care of you if I let this pass . And the switch whicked and bit and Cathie caught her breath and then as if in a wild try at courage and defiance she opened her mouth and began , in a high , clear voice , to sing . Hush that while I 'm switching you ! Hush it I say . But she would not stop and she found the furious little rhythm of the switch strokes and matched her song to that . Nellie Bly , Nellie Bly , bring the broom along ! We 'll sweep the kitchen clean , my dear , and have a little song ! Be still ! Be still , I say ! ? Hi Nellie , Ho Nellie ! Listen , love , to me ! I 'll sing for you , play for you a dulcet melody ! And Aunt Sarah switched till the branch was bare of its bark and broken and dangling in her thwarted hand . She stared at Cathie 's quivering back a moment and then whirled her round to face her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and a smile of speechless victory . Are you sorry now ? No , ma'am . Then I 've done all God could expect , said Aunt Sarah . Sometimes I wonder if I 'm strong enough for the task of raising you both up decent and Christian . Her face seemed suddenly a decade older and her eyes were pale and scared . It ai n't been the easiest thing in the world ! she snapped at us both . Neither of you know the nights I 've laid awake and sleepless ? praying for you  --  asking His forgiveness for the Sin that has already stained you ! Sometimes I wonder if I 'm strong enough for it . If I 'd had a man to help with it  --  a man , mind you , and not him yonder  | in the parlor with his tonics and snake oils and pills  --  a man with eyes , and backbone , mind you ! I just wonder if either of you knows what it 's like to live all your life in the same house with a father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and a man you pitied and sickened over for the rest . Do you ? No , I 'll allow you do n't as yet . And may you never . Are you listening to me ? Does any of this mean anything to you ? No . Of course not . I 'm a fool . Come yonder , the both of you . We stepped shy and high-footed into the radius of her strange , camphorous embrace and let her hold us there stiffly and strangely with her chin above our heads and at her gathered collar the gold claw pin with its dusky , faded pearl scratching my ear as she drew me to her . She held us there a while more and then began speaking again , as if she had half forgotten we were there . I whip you and holler at you , she said harshly , as if the words strained like steam against a cock . And you 'll never get too big for that  --  but I pray for you , too . And if I can raise you both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember me . I 'm queer and old and you can think what you please of me but remember , if you can , that it 's none of it been easy . I done every bit as good as I could with you and with everybody else  --  him included who sits yonder blind and simple as a halfwit on the roads  --  mocking God by trying to call back the poor ghost of the child of my own womb  --  the child , Catherine Ellen , that I watched laid into the hill up yonder ? under the creepers . Mind that , the both of you ! I 'm not asking your pity and I 'd box your ears if you had the impudence to give it . But I must say this . God only knows I must say it once , at least  --  that I think only of raising you both  --  poor , motherless orphans  --  to be decent and Christian ! God help us all ! It 's a dark time that 's coming on us ! A dark time ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for a moment longer and each of us was too puzzled to move  --  too stunned at this seeming softness in her , and she sensed that and withdrew suddenly and folded her hands in her apron and surveyed us coldly through her tiny twinkling lenses and then sniffed drily and turned and left us in that quaint , bitter wake of camphor and lavender that always trailed her like a memory : that smell mingling with sassafras and cider and the smell of crumbling summer in the pantry where , upon the dusty pane , the fly still bumbled and strove against his brief summer covenance.  | In the parlor . Nightfall . And now , as I sometimes liked to do , I crept there , across the threshold , to see how close I could come to the blind man before he sensed me there . And it was a thing that seemed a kind of witchcraft that he would turn his head always to me the very moment my foot touched the farthest ragged fringe of the old flowery rug , no matter how soft I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and set a spell ! And I went to the square stool , big and gangly and twelve now but no less eager for the three-cent piece that came less regularly now , for times were lean in the last years of that decade . His fingers finished their quest of my face and fell with a soft thump to the chair arms again . Where 's the gal ? She 's in her room , I said . Thinking , I reckon . She thinks a lot these days , Uncle Joe . She 's queer , I think . All women are queer , boy ! Why ? Hah ! Ask Adam . It was his rib  --  not mine . For one thing there 's always something workin ' in ' em ! How do you mean ? Workin ' , that 's what I mean ! Bubblin ' and workin ' in ' em  --  like mother in the cider barrel ! A female is always changin ' into something or other new , boy , and do n't forget it ! It 's always brewin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! In their blood , I allow ! And here 's the tricky thing ! ? you never know how it 'll turn out  --  if it 'll come up vinegar or apple cider . The main thing is to let ' em be till they git done with one changin ' and hope for the best ! And then when they start in to changin ' again just go find a rocker and shet your teeth on snuff or a chew and thank God to be out of their path ! He reached out suddenly and patted me heavily on the head . And you , Tom ? Are you well ? Yes , I said . But I 'm worried about Cathie . Ahh . She ca n't fight like she used to , I said darkly and with a kind of desperation . She just ai n't worth a tinker 's dam in a fight any more . He grunted and tapped his foot nervously and his stomach quarreled shrilly and growled low and suddenly he chuckled and tapped leis foot some more . Her chest hurts easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you laughin ' at ! I 'm not laughin ' , Tom ! That 's a bad sign in a gal of eleven ! A bad one indeed ! What else ? Nothin ' you can pin down , I said . Her muscles have just gone plum to wrack and ruin , though . Ho . Hah ! What ? The apple cometh to ripeness upon the bough , he cried softly to the dusk and rocked and his stomach growled shrilly again and he chuckled some more . What ? Shhhh . Hush , boy . It 's her ! Cathie ? I whispered , blushing with nameless shame and jumping to my feet . No , he said softly . It 's my little dear . My Peggy . It 's her birthday and I 've got a little gift . And I saw it in the lampshine in his palsied , dead-white hands ? something shapeless and foolish wrapped as fancy as he could make it in a bit of brown paper and a ribbon he had stolen from the box in Aunt Sarah 's quilting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly up the hallway and there was a cricket somewhere in the wood and it cried so silver and sharp in the motionless , limpid blackness that it seemed speaking on my shoulder . Peggy ? he cried softly in the stillness behind me . And I thought to myself : I will run out the back door quickly , before I hear her black , small shoes go padding to him , before I hear the bell of that small , ghost voice as it rises before his believing blind gaze . It was dark now and there was no moon and the mists lay on the meadows below the road like a white swaddling with trees rising amidst it like motionless soldiers , in a snow field . I thought : I will go to Dulcie 's house and talk , to Doctor Willie . And I hurried , knowing all the way through the darkness of our barnyard , tumbling up the hill through the twinkling dust of fireflies and all about me on the still apron of the hill , sheep lifted blunt noses and tinkled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow trails . I saw the lamp far off and gold behind the curtains of Dulcie 's parlor and knew they had not gone to bed , and I hurried through the graveyard , running lightfooted on my heels so the dreamers would not waken and yawn their ivory jaws  | and turn troubled in their long rooms , ran along the backbone of the hill into the hair of the wind and saw where the moon was , after all : curled and cunning in a chestnut tree by Dulcie 's stable . I rapped softly and waited and rapped again and something sighed beyond the panels and Doctor Willie opened the door and stood there smiling at me in the light of that faint August moon : stood there with the quietness of the small house pouring over his shoulders like a soft sea of cinnamon-scented air . Do you feel the need of medical attention , Thomas ? he inquired with a twinkle . Or did you just come to be sociable and have a dish of Dulcie 's Italian Cream ? ti I 'm fine , Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spied between his yellowed long teeth the black nail of the clove . Yes , I said , sitting carefully on the embroidered shepherdess on Dulcie 's special company chair . It 's Catherine Ellen Hornbrook I 'm worried about . She is not well ? Mighty queer ! Eh ? She 's actin ' mighty queer these days ! Ahh ? How so ? Her chest hurts her ! And you ? How are you , Thomas ? Me ? Oh , I 'm fit as can be expected , Doctor Willie ! Fit as can be expected . That 's fine , boy ! These are trying times ! Do you reckon ? I said lowly , with the sudden dreadful presentiment that I would soon be left alone in the world . That Catherine Ellen has consumption ? Thomas ! cried Doctor Willie , bowing to me gravely and chuckling to himself over something very secret , something very wise and old . You may as well know it now ? . What ? I gasped softly and felt my palms grow wet . We are all suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of medicine and , however melancholy it may be , I will not keep the truth from you ? ! He fetched a black crooked stogie from the inner pocket of his immaculate white coat and fumbled in his vest for the silver cutter , holding the stogie aloft , meanwhile , like the wand of a conjurer while I waited , caged in dread .  | We are all mighty poorly , Thomas ! All of us  --  mighty , might-y poorly ! And would you like to know the name of our affliction ? Yes . Time ! Time , dear heart . I doubt , Thomas ? ( and he bent on the words , eyes bulging with the drama of it ) ? I doubt if we shall live out the century ! I scowled and itched with puzzlement and thought how grown-ups never spoke out plain : never handed you the truth without a fancy wrapping round it . But now Dulcie came into the parlor with Cynthie in her wake , bearing between them a blue willow-ware platter of fresh bread and strawberry preserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dappled , sweet-chymed cow . Good evening , Thomas ! Pleased you could come ! Dulcie wore a lace bonnet and she never smiled with her small , pursed mouth though her eyes were sometimes full of it : a mocking , slow irony and a gentleness even about that . Like Cynthie she was spare as a bird  --  wrenlike and chipper and fond of old woman 's fripperies and one might have thought her trivial until she spoke or until she turned her dark piercing eyes upon the wisdom of a thing , or on the folly of some person . Cynthie was one of the foolish ones of this world : she simpered and giggled almost continuously because she was frightened and believed , like as not , that in giggling lay safety . Dulcie was practical and put up fruit against winter but Cynthie saved string imagining a time of poverty , perhaps , in which the world should grow bare of string and she would have none and none , in fact , would be anywhere : a desperate stringless time . Dulcie looked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to Charley Lindsay had been an arid season she knew , at least , what she had missed . As for Cynthie she never guessed what there might have been to miss and I am convinced that through those long , strange evenings when Charley rode the river road to her cottage there was nothing more between them , than euchre . Thomas ! said Dulcie in her faint but snapping voice . You look peaked ! I do n't believe Sary feeds you good ! Eat that bread and jelly and drink your milk . Pshaw , Willie , do n't that boy look underfed to you ? But he had slipped off to his pantry cup and stood in the shadows somewhere in the little house , eyes shut , shuddering a little under the impact of the half cup of brandy , sucking the bitterness of it from his mustache.  | He 's drinking again ! Cynthie observed in a harsh whisper that shook her onyx earrings , announcing it as if it were a new fact of Willie Curtis ' life and not the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie is a drunkard ! Dulcie , I declare ! You 're just awful ! Well it 's true ! There 's no need to hide the truth  --  nor to dwell on it neither ! Thomas , how 's the little Hornbrook girl ! Poorly , I sighed . Pshaw ! I hear her and you come whoopin ' through the graveyard every day like red Injuns ! How can she be poorly ! I shrugged glumly and stared at my hands . I think , I whispered , that she has taken the galloping consumption . Shoot ! She gallops enough . I declare , Cynthie , young people seem such fools since I was a girl ! Thomas , drink your milk  --  it 'll put meat on your bones ! Willie , come look at Thomas  --  I think he 's got the solemncholies ! Doctor Willie came back into the room , some steadiness gone but no elegance lacking and snorted and sat down in a rocker with his legs dangling like a child in long white pants . Willie , mind now and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ellen Baker is quick with her child and you know there 's no one else can come ! Mind now ! Madam , I have not had one drop of brandy since Christmas ! Hah ! Well Merry Christmas then , you old fool ! she snapped and her eyes laughed again . Thomas , what word is there from the father ? What father , Miss Dulcie ? Why Catherine Ellen 's father  --  Bige Hornbrook ? He writes sometimes , I said . He 's gone off to the prairies ! Gone to the prairies has he ! Like as not to join up with those fools who 'll have our rooves down around our ears before they 're through . Bige says there 's going to be a War , I whispered and felt a proudness tingle my legs as if he were my father , too . And there will be ! she cried . With a bunch of damned fool men to start it and the women to endure it as they always have and take care of their orphans and wait hand and foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Lord , I mind Mexico ! Such a pack of fools !  | Abijah is not a fool , I said a little archly . He 's goin ' to be a King . I finished my milk , keeping my eyes in the cup till the whiteness was gone . So Bige aims to come back to the bottoms a King , eh ? Well , Lord knows he might at that . Lord knows who 'll be King when these fool men get done with the ruckus Mister Calhoun 's stirred up ! Cynthie nodded at each thing Dulcie said and regarded me meekly with eyes as blue as double wash-water : innocent newborn eyes , it seemed : foolish and pleasing as a lamb 's . It was Dulcie who knew the wide world 's ways while Cynthie had grown both deaf and blind to all mortality , heedless of time or of human orneriness . And I reckon your Aunt Sarah would be fit to be tied if she knew you was here , eh Thomas ? But it was not a question at all because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile and she snatched up the blue platter and went to the kitchen for more bread and strawberries . Mister Curtis says there 'll be a War , too ! said Cynthie in that soft , high quavering voice that seemed to come faintly always as if through water . The snow shall fly again , he says , and then there 'll be a War ! Ai n't that so , Doctor Willie ? It is so , Miss Lindsay ! It is so ! Tell young Thomas about Mexico , Doctor Willie ! Thomas , Doctor Willie rode with Winfield Scott  --  such a fine man ! When I was a boy fresh from school , Thomas , I went up the mountains with Pillow 's Third Division and I was at Chapultepec and Churubusco and sawed off more legs and arms than you 've cut stove wood ! And I thought that war was the finest thing mortal man had ever done ! Proud of it , d'ye see ? And it took me thirty years of reflection to find it was a war of cowards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that ! When the War starts in the South you 'll like as not want to enlist as drummer boy ! Pshaw ! He sprang down from the rocker and pointed , his head thrown back and his mustaches stirring like a bleached flag . Look yonder , boy ! There by the window in the glass case . The mask ! That , too , was the magic of Dulcie 's house . I went to where he was pointing , to the round-bellied curio cabinet by the window and stared inside at the ordered litter of nautilus shells and souvenir handkerchiefs from Mister Barnum 's Museum and the arrowheads and the little button box crusted with seashells and the ivory fan from India .  | I stared at the mask , too : a hammered copper oval the size of a man 's face , its metal brown with time and rains and scarred perhaps by the fires of some old Armageddon . He fetched a tiny key from a tiny amber glass on the mantelpiece and unlocked the glass door and lifted the mask out . Looky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and look at me through it . I held the mask to my face . It had eyes cut out the slant-shape of a Chinee 's eyes and the cheeks of it were long and flat and rippled with savage , faint marks like the tattoos of a Sandwich Islander . I stared at Doctor Willie through the savage , ancient slits . I dug that mask out of the big mound up yonder at Elizabethtown ! he exclaimed . That mask , boy , that was made by the hand of man dead and moldering a thousand years . Injuns ? Pshaw no ! Injuns never made masks  --  not out of metal leastways ! The Lord God Himself only knows what people made that thing . But mind this , Thomas  --  the man that made that mask was mortal like you and me ! Get that ? Mortal . And where is he now ? Gone to dust , that 's where ! Gone to dust and sprouting up in the corn and blowin ' on the roads ! And mind you  --  his were a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've contested that by the hour with Major Tomlinson on the courthouse steps ! Gone , Thomas ! And if he had a flag that 's gone , too ! You may be breathin ' his mortality this very minute and the dust of that flag , as well ! Sure ! And I will allow he thought he was the best man that ever lived and his people the chosen of whatever God he had ! I 'll bet my last shinplaster he even thought his wars would save the world ! And what 's left , Thomas ! A sheet of copper with the green , moldering ages crusted on it and the eyes that looked out of those slits where your eyes peer  --  dust ! Dust ! I tell you Time is our sickness , ladies and gentlemen ! We shall not live the century out ! And Pride is our crutch . Lord , but the Almighty Jehovah must be plaguey sick of drums by now ! Caesar in Spain ! Hannibal on the Alps ! Frederick and Tippecanoe and all the rest ! Preachers 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But I say there 's a Third Place and it 's called the Old Camp Ground and it is populated by the ghosts of poor idiots that followed a drum ! Somewhere behind him in the sea-green house a clock struck in punctuation to his words and Dulcie came back with more bread and  | preserves just as I rose to leave . She fussed and fretted that company never stayed long enough and I thanked her kindly and said I 'd better get home before Aunt Sarah sent Coy hunting me . From afar I could see the tiny black shape of Aunt Sarah in the golden oblong of pantry window under the dappling apple boughs . She was waiting for me when I came in and from the way her black eyes twinkled I believe she knew where I had been . But she said nothing ; I think she was abashed for the way she had bared herself to Cathie and me that day . Get along up to bed now , Thomas , it 's past nine ! Yes 'm . I went up the pantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie 's voice had stayed in me and stirred me like strong drink I turned suddenly to her on the stairs and cried out : There 's goin ' to be a War , Aunt Sarah ! Can I go ? Hush , Thomas ! You 're a child yet ! I 'm twelve ! I cried in the cracked-voice humiliation of my halfway years . God knows if you will go , she said strongly to the darkness outside the window . He will dispose whether you go or not and if you return . It 's not for me to say or you either , Thomas ! Go to bed now , child ! There 'll be no war tonight at least ! I dreamed through that dark August night . I sweated in my sheets and turned my face to the moon until it burned and then thrashed round and lay with my sleeping face to the dusky , faint flowers in the faded , stained wallpaper and the dream wound me round . I had heard a night bird whistling when I fell asleep . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds to sing at night , the moon troubles them , I guess , and they sing because they are afraid . I had heard Toot say that once and I thought it must be so because Toot had known God when He was a boy , innocent and free and lonely in His garden with no child named Adam to cheer Him by the supper fire . Toot must be right because Toot had told me once that when the snowball bush bloomed in the wintertime it was a sure sign of death and it had bloomed the week my dog Cato froze in the laurels above Fish Creek with a stiff , staring hare locked in his grinning teeth . I dreamed that I had the gold mask that old Adam had worn and it was mine now and when I put it up to my face it suddenly  | grew into the flesh of my cheek and brow and lips and shaped itself to the shape of me . And I went to the browned , watery mirror in my Grandfather 's room and looked at myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it was and it took my breath away . Abijah . Yes , and Cathie came into the room then and looked at me , crying , and stamping her feet the way she used to do when she was little and shouted : Take it off ! Take it off ! You 're not Abijah ! You 're not ! It 's just pretend ! You 're not Abijah ! And outside the house someone was beating a drum and someone else was playing a fife like when the Fourth of July parade happens up at Elizabethtown and the little darkies sell pink lemonade round the courthouse yard . Cathie hollering at me to take off the mask and the drum getting louder and the fife getting louder and she came at me then with her face all wild and ugly like Aunt Sarah 's face sometimes when she 's mad and she put up her fingers to pull off my mask and I hit her . I hit her again and again and again with something long and thick and killing and she fell across me and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my belly and I kept trying to push her off but she was heavy with deadness . And I woke up then panting and gasping with my fingers in the feathers of the bolster and my eyes blinking in the burning summer moon and thought : It 's real . It 's real . Oh Lord , I really done it . I killed her . I done killed Catherine Ellen . Because I can feel it still all over my stomach , thick and hot and dead under my nightshirt : the blood of her . I lay for a long time hearing the fife of the night bird and the drum of my slowing pulse and dreading morning when I would have to look and see if the wetness was really her blood after all . Toot met me in the kitchen doorway scowling and suspicious . What you doin ' with de spade dis time of morning ? Shoot ! De of rooster ai n't even crowed yet ! Nothin ' ! I bleated , blushing wildly . Sho now ! I seen you put it back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , too ! And I heared you up and bustlin ' ' round de yard ' fore Miss Sarah even lit de lamps ! I buried a dead bird , I lied , and she sniffed and turned the mush in the sputtering grease of the black skillet and went to call them to breakfast . May Tom and me have the mare this mornin ' ? said Cathie when  | Aunt Sarah had finished her coffee and seemed kindly disposed toward the day . No . Coy needs her to haul fence posts from the west pasture . Yes 'm . What do you want her for ? Seems like you children ride that poor beast to death . Where do you go ? To see about Abijah 's boat , Cathie said with a shy , proud smile . He meant for me to mind it for him till he gets back . Pshaw ! That boat ! It 's the laughingstock of every river man in Wheeling ! If Bige Hornbrook meant to leave the river and go off about whatever nonsense took him South then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some good out of her ! Oh no ! Abijah would never sell the Nellie Queen ! It 's not proper for a child to refer to her father by his Christian name ! He likes me to , said Cathie , eyes downcast with angry pride . That does n't matter . It 's impudence . If I 'd ever dared to address my sainted father as Michael he 'd have had my hide off with a buggy whip . You 've a sight more manners to learn than you 've got now , Miss Hornbrook ! Yes 'm . And that fool steamboat of your father 's is better off left to rot down there on the creek bank where he left it . Pshaw ! A man who 'd put an old woman and a child ashore and then go off gallivantin ' ai n't fit to be pilot ! Steamboatin 's for responsible men of Christian character . Cathie suddenly took a long drink of milk and hid her blazing eyes behind the cup a long time after the milk was gone and her throat had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cathie ran out the back door and stood under the apple tree looking off toward the hill behind which the white boat towered . Let 's go see her today , Tom , she whispered . I 'm worried about the Nellie Queen . I had bad dreams about her all night long ! Was n't last night an awful night to sleep ? I gave her a quick , darting glance but I thought : she could n't know my dream any more than I could know hers . But I was n't sure . It was too hot to sleep good , I said . And the moon was in my face all the livelong night ! And that fool mockingbird kept singing in the apple tree !  | Oh yes ! I just love to hear them ! Well , I do n't ! It means evilness when a bird sings at night ! Who said ? Toot did . Oh . Well , it did sound pretty ! I could n't sleep good . I know , she said , not looking at me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up . I could hear you all the way in my room . I said nothing , stumping on ahead of her , a stick in my hand now , punching the dust beside me like a gypsy 's staff . Tom ? . What ? Tom , what were you burying this morning ? I stopped and turned and stood facing her . Nothing . Yes , you were . I heard you go downstairs long before sunup and after a bit I looked out my window and saw you walking down from the smoke house with the spade over your shoulder and your nightshirt under your arm . Suddenly I wanted to hit her like I had done in the dream and that scared me and I laughed like a fool and began whistling a jib . What were you , she teased while I thought of an answer . The bird , I said at last and turned and walked into the sunlight safely . The mocking bird ? Yep . You never ! I did too ! I just could n't abide that daggone whistlin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fetched him down off the branch of the plum tree slick as a whistle ! And then I fetched the spade and buried him . That 's a lie . It 's not . It is too , because I heard that bird singing long after you 'd gone . That just shows you ! I cried , inspired . Toot said it was a witchy bird ! That was its ghost singing . And she said no more and we walked on into the morning and I frowned , wondering to myself why I had done that thing : gone and buried my nightshirt there in that cool shadow before sunrise , like  | a murderer , under the plum tree , spading out the cool , small grave in the secret shine of the morning star . We spent the whole morning on board the beached and splendid Nellie Queen and Cathie found a ring of tiny bronze keys in a box in the pilot house and we tried them and found each one unlocked one of the staterooms below . In the texas we both stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a framed daguerreotype of Cathie 's dead mother  --  her faint , frail face dark and violent as a gypsy 's . On a hook hung a faded blue gown that she had worn once ? Abijah would never throw any of her things away . On a shelf we found a tortoise-shell box full of glass gimcracks that she had treasured and her silver-mounted comb and a hand mirror that was cracked and when I lifted it my own face seemed halved and shifted in a bewitched and frightening way and I put the mirror quickly back and smelled a faint perfume in the air : a something of that long-vanished flesh that still persisted in the place where she had been loved . We spent an hour unlocking all the staterooms softly and peering in : the Ohio , the Virginia ( an old beaver hat and a bundle of Travelling Menagerie posters still lay on the bunk ) and the Kentucky where Cathie showed me the hole where the bullet had gone into the wall the night a gambler had killed his wife with a little dueling pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek hollow and we lolled on the texas deck and listened to the mud-dawbers crawling up the shimmering air and the redbirds flashing and quarreling above us in the blue fever of sky . Far off where the river shimmered we heard the blast of a tin horn and jumped up and ran to the stern of the boat and peered out over the paddles toward the trees . Behind the green curtain of willows we could see the slow movement of a small hooded craft and when it came to the mouth of the creek we saw the peddler at the till and he blew his tin horn again and we shouted and waved . He saw us and fought the long covered boat into the creek and rowed up abreast of the Nellie Queen and took off his leghorn hat and peered up at us , squinting into the sun . Where 's the master of this hyer boat ? I had opened my mouth to claim that honor but Cathie hollered back to him that Captain Abijah Hornbrook had gone ashore on business and left her in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ! she cried and I saw the hunger in her eyes to see the peddler 's fancy store and I was curious , too , and followed her down to the boiler deck where the peddler now stood . He was the skinniest man I 'd ever seen and his hair was white as calf-slobber and his face was wrinkled and sunburned . Er you the Cap'm 's daughter ? Yes , sir , I am ! she cried , curtsying . Well , whar 's he at ! Gone ashore , I said ! she cried . To tend to business ! And I 'm in charge of the Nellie Queen till he gets back so do n't try any impu-dence ! Do you need pins ? Can I sell you some needles er a piece of purty ribbon ? Sa-a-y ! Bet that feller yonder could use a jew's-harp ! I tuk on a box of ' em at Wheelin ' and I bet they wo n't be a one left ' gainst I put in at the Falls ! Shore , now ! How about a dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near sold ever ' last tarnal one of them dresses up yonder at Elizabethtown but somethin ' told me you 'd be here and needin ' one ! Yes , ma'am , hit war just like I knowed aforehand you 'd be a-standin ' right there whar you er now on the boiler deck of yore daddy 's boat and I saved this hyer last dress fer you ! He had gone back under the strange , patchwork canopy of his little boat and came out with the thing in his arms  --  the folds of it blowing in the sudden gust of hot wind that had come up behind him from the river . It 's beautiful ! she breathed softly . Oh , Tom , it is beautiful ! Shore it is ! Fit for a Queen ! Yes ! For a Queen , she said in that trance , beside me . Want to know somethin ' , little miss ? I sold a dress just like this'n hyer to Mister Charles Dickens himself when he come through Wheelin ' years and years ago ! And ye know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd take it back for old Queen Victory herself ' cause it was just too tarnal purty for gentry ! Them was his words and I 'll swear to it . Too purty for gentry ! There now ! Three dollars ! And that 's just naturally walkin ' off with it ! Could I  --  hold it up to me ? Why shore ! Hyer ! She took it and held it to her shoulders with quaking fingers and let her eyes run down its length in a kind of fearfulness of such beauty .  | Lawk ! Hit 's a shame you hai n't got a peer glass , ma'am ! You look fancier than the President 's lady ! Run fetch the mirror from Mama 's shelf ! It 's in the texas , Tom . I went and got it and came back with a leaden heart , knowing how sourly the bright interlude must end at last , when he found out the fact of our poverty . But I held the cracked hand-glass before her while she pranced and curtsied in it like a bewitched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream that nothing could snatch it away . The peddler fetched his knee a slap with his ragged yellow leghorn hat and crowed at the sight . Lawsy , it was made for you , miss ! When does yore Pap get back ? She let the dress fall to her waist then and stared at him gawkmouthed for an instant . Then she thust the dress out for him to take back and stared off up the shimmering road , to the groves beyond where the wild birds cried in the coolness of the pawpaw leaves . Three dollars hai n't much ! he sniffed . For a store-made dress like that ! I do n't really need it ! she cried . The Captain 's gone to Elizabethtown to buy me a much prettier dress than that ! Why , pshaw ! I thought you was real taken with it ! It 's nice , I 'll grant you ! she said . For some girls . Maybe some of them yellow gals down on the landin ' at Cincinnati ! Shoot ! Hai n't one of them nigras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ! she said , turning away from him and cocking her head at herself in the cracked looking glass . I do n't think it goes with my eyes ! Two-fifty and , by Jingo , I 'd starve and dry up and blow away if I was to give my stock away like this ever ' time I put in to shore ! No , she said . When Abijah  --  when the Captain gets back ? . And she stopped , not in a sob , but in a way that made me know , without seeing , that her white teeth were fixed tight in the fullness of her lower lip . Well , I declare ! growled the peddler and wallowed off back to his boat and sat in the shade of it scratching the sandy hair under his hat and spit in the water . How about some pins ? Or horn buttons ? Or a piece of fancy ribbon mebbe ? She walked away to the Nellie Queen with an elegance that could have been either disdain or downfall or pride either and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peddler 's oars creaked off into the stillnesses of humming noon and faded , finally , into the hovering , lacing whine of wasps and the pirate honey-bees in the meadow 's high clover . I followed her and laid my hand on her stiff , trembling shoulder . Sometimes , I said , a body has to tell a lie . And before I could catch my breath she spun round and struck me flat-handed across the lips . I never lied ! There was a taste of blood like pennies on my tongue and I tried to remember what it was 1 had dreamed under the moon that night , under that night long washed away : that dream of killing . Do n't say I lied ! she wailed , wild-faced and sorrowing and proud . Because it 's true ! It 's true ! He 'll come back ! And he 'll bring me a dress and it 'll be silk and not any cheap , common river-peddler 's calico ! And pins ! Gold pins ! And ribbons for my hair ! Her face dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran . I hate you ! I just hate and despise you , Thomas Christopher ! And she ran ahead of me all the long way home . Toot missed my nightshirt in the Monday wash and quarreled aplenty about it . She accused Coy of stealing it and he denied that and so she quarreled with the wash-water as if it might have prankishly dissolved my nightshirt just to tease her poor tired eyes . And she never thought to ask me what I knew and no one ever mentioned it again and I was left with only the abiding and corrosive memory of that night . Hit 's blowin ' up a storm ! said Toot that afternoon with a glance to southward through the pantry window . There was not a breath of moving air in the house or outside in the burning sun , but I knew there were winds that Toot heard that no one else could know . Hit 's kickin ' up my gout somethin ' terr'ble ! she cried , glaring out into the parched , quivering air beneath the apple tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain splatters on the window . Sho now ! I reckon it 's gwine to be a storm bad enough to blow down de moun-tains ! I do n't see no clouds , I said . And the wind 's not blowin ' .  | Pshaw ! You 'll see ! Thunder 'll come a-crackin ' down de river d'reckly ! Sho now ! You 'll see ! I grinned at her and helped tighten the jar lids for her because in canning-time her fingers were too old and poorly for the task . Aunt Sarah was up on the hillside showing Coy how she wanted the horseradish dug and he was loudly humming to himself because he was so cracking mad that she always told him how to do things that he was born a-knowing . And Toot grunted when the first far roll of thunder growled to southward . What did I say now ! she cried . Hit 's a-comin ' . My gouty foot do n't never lie . Sho ! I went out under the apple tree and felt a space of coolness move around me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Cathie could have gotten to and heard the ceaseless racket of the green summer winged-things in the hair of the hill and in the river meadow : they seemed hurrying to get things done before the storm , before the summer was quenched and ended . Thomas ? She stood knee-deep in the ironweed on the slopes below Dulcie 's house and waved at me . Yes , Aunt Sarah ? Where 's Catherine Ellen ? I do n't know ! What ? I say I do n't know ! Well go fetch her home ! There 's a bad storm brewin ' . Yes 'm ! And I thought for a while she might have gone off alone down river to the boat and I angered at the thought : it was mine now too , and so was all the rest of it to share : the boat and the War and the King who would come riding in his time . Ca-thie ! A sudden bright squawling gust swept through the yard and seemed to tangle for an instant in the apple tree and fling its boughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver rippling shadow on the grass . I called again but with no urgency in my voice because I knew where she was now and it did n't matter . I knew too well that special breed of loneliness that craves solitude and I would have bet my eyes that she was where I would have gone , where I often went , when  | that curious fever was upon me : to the attic and the wing of the roof that hugged one like the sheltering feather of a mothering hawk , to the most solitary place in God 's creation . I declare ! I do n't know what I 'm going to do with you children ! That girl , especially ! I expect a Christian day 's work from each of you and instead of that you seem to do nothing but wander about like dumb sheep ! Did you call her , Thomas ? Yes 'm . Have you laid eyes on her , Toot ? No 'm ! Gracious sakes alive ! She went to the great flagstone by the corner of the smoke house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carved initials , worn nigh to obliteration now by time and wind and rain and moon : T.C. Anno Domini 1767 ? my Grandfather 's father had chiseled them there in the time of the Iroquois , and the mad English king : she stood there shadowing her eyes with her fingers and scowling off into the impending storm : twenty-five miles down river , beyond the Ohio hills . I came and stood beside her and stared at it : the rim of blinding light fringing the far horizon and the purple gathering clouds above it : curling and moving now in high and sluggish tumult . Sho gwine to come a-crackin ' down d'reckly ! cried Toot from the kitchen . Reckon I better fasten de shudders , Miz Sary ? Yes ! Go shut them , Toot ! Run help her , Tom ! Gracious , I wonder where that Hornbrook child has gone to ! Toot and I ran round the house shuttering the windows . The air was calm as held breath before a quick word and there seemed to everything a sharpness of line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front porch , his nostrils fair quivering with alarm . The gum tree , three hundred yards down the meadow on the river road , seemed so close and vivid that a hand could have reached out and held it like a toy . And the darkness quickened and now small gusts of wind flung against the house like gales of small laughter and random rain drops broke in crystal on the windowpanes and thunder rolled like struggling armies , faintly . Great day in the morning , Tom ! Run see if that girl is in her room ! Toot ! Yes 'm . Are all the shutters fastened ?  | Yes 'm ! I fled two steps at a stride up the carpeted staircase to Cathie 's room but I knew she would not be there . I knew well and good where she was but I knew , too , how needful it is to be alone when this particular kind of loneliness comes like a storm of its own , a tempest in the brain ; and I went to my room and sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands and watched the storm approach across the far-flung plateau of Ohio , beyond the river which , itself , seemed changed now , dark and bloodlike and all the willows on the far bank mirrored plainly now in shoal waters that the wind had not yet broken . Thomas ? The thunderhead was black now and piling layer upon layer of still more dark and turgid purple upon itself until , even in that distance , it seemed to tower mile upon mile into the heavens and its heart , flickered and laced with lightning , showed the vast churning of long shroudlike mists . It stood up now over the whole of the south and seemed to lean now over our hill , over the house , over my very window and to begin a slow and inexorable collapse upon us all . Thomas Christopher ! Answer me ! Is Catherine Ellen in her room ? Yes 'm ! I lied , because I thought she would have done that for me . Well , tell her to get downstairs at once ! And you too ! Hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of storms . I think she thought of them as a final explosion of God 's long-suffering endurance : a smashing down of His fist in last exasperation . When the storms came from the river hills she would cover the mirrors and gather the whole household about her elbow and those of us that could be encompassed comfortably she would embrace stiffly in her stiff-clothed arms and keep us there until the wrath was past , as if she considered that should one impatient lightning bolt of angry Jove find us out and strike us to cinders at least there would be no lost children in Egypt . Thomas ? Mind me ! The armies of the rain breached the river now : the willows suddenly staggered under them as the white sheets broke in fierce onslaught and a split instant later the river reflections disappeared in a white ruffle of broken water like a fleet of arrows and the white shadow on the ruffled water swept swiftly toward the Virginia shore . It was wholly dark now , except for the lightning which flickered and snapped like a lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and the day had not even ended and the house was in a midnight of hushed waiting for the storm 's assault . And yet I knew that Aunt Sarah would not light one candle nor any lamp in kitchen , hallway or parlor . She would have no light in the house when storms came as if she imagined that God might think our small lamps offensive rivals to His lightnings , or that perhaps the dark judgment of His storm would pass us by safely if it could not see us huddled there by the cold stove in the fragrant , cinnamon-scented safety of Toot 's pantry . Thomas ! Thomas Alexander Christopher ! Yes 'm ! And I jumped from my stool just as the white rain exploded against the six panes of my window and the world dissolved and thunder fell about my ears . Cathie ! I clambered up the ladder and peered at her in the shadowed eave , watched as her moon face turned and stared . Go away . No . Aunt Sarah 's mad . You know how she gets when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's over . You better mind . All right , she sighed . It was so beautiful ! She got wearily to her feet and stood slender and frail against the slates for a moment brushing the cobwebs from her linsey skirt and then came toward me , her white toes pacing shrewdly along the narrow joist like small white birds . When I had gone down the ladder to make way for her and stared up at her brown heels hugging the rungs I saw that she had a sheet of Aunt Sarah 's writing paper and a pencil in her hand . What 's that ? Never mind what ! she scolded and hid it behind her . What is it ? That 's Aunt Sarah 's own private writing paper ! I only took one sheet . What are you writing ? Thomas ? Catherine Ellen ? If I have to come up there after you I 'll bring a switch or two ! Come on ! Cathie cried with a brave laugh and folded the paper and hid it in her dress and the pencil with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpeted stairway to the hall . Come here , children ! By me ! Joseph ! Toot , run fetch Mister Christopher in from the parlor ! Lord , it 's a blessing to be blind with  | all this lightning . Here , Thomas ! Catherine Ellen ! By me . Here ! Come with your stools ! And she embraced us in the stiff awkward angle of those arms so unused to the several shapes of love or its enfoldings : held us tight against her and put her chin up to the window and when the lightning blazed against the rain-swarming panes like a swinging torch I could see her dark pupils widen the smallest breadth and that was all ; her lips would not quiver nor tighten and I think her heart did not even quicken but beat on , steady as the thick flowered gold watch that hung in her bodice . God 's a-wandering tonight ! she breathed once and did not think we heard : it was a word meant for herself ; and Toot came into the black pantry with Uncle Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove with Suse and Coy and smacked her lips and rolled her white eyes in the gloom . Faint and mournful and lost in the tumult of the storm the whistle of a boat cried as it groped far away on the river channel . Lordy God ! chanted Toot softly . Hit 's de Julia Dean ! Out dere lost in all dis wrath ! I bet Cap 'm Newbolt sho ' is prayin ' fo ' his rousters tonight ! We heard the boat 's cry again : a rolling , chorded sob of sound and the thunder boomed and drowned it . And still the storm mounted and we knew it was far from its peak and the lightning quickened so that there were whole praying moments when the air seemed alive and shaking with light and the face of each of us , wooden and waiting there in helpless Mortality , would be silvered with it : all things bright as mirror-shine in that dreadful shimmering wash : silver faces and silver pitchers on a cloth of silver calico and the eyes of the blind man like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's mighty wrothy ! Hush ! cried Aunt Sarah , and Cathie stirred impatiently and I saw her face in the lightning in an instant 's picture and her eyes were wide as if in the stare of a sleepwalker and her lips were curved in a smile of thralldom and glory . It 's beautiful ! she breathed and Aunt Sarah heard her and twisted her head to stare down at the girl in outrage . Hush , Catherine Ellen ! Do n't mock the fury of His elements ! I 'm not ! I 'm not ! she sang softly . Oh , it 's so beautiful ! I wish you could have been upstairs and seen it a-coming ! So beautiful ! Like a vision !  | Be still ! And if you must speak  --  say a prayer ! Toot had commenced rocking in a furious , stubborn rhythm as if life and death depended upon that motion , as if by this bobbing to and fro she might persuade God to spare her . I did see a vision ! cried Cathie softly . Hush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw white armies on white horses ! I will not abide that talk now ! Hush , Catherine Ellen ! We are in the palm of God 's wrath ! I saw them clash together in a meadow and fight a glorious war ! And I saw Abijah on a white horse and he led them ! Oh , it was so beautiful ! Sho ! cried Toot . Ev'body talkin ' ' bout heb'n ai n't goin ' dere ! Sho ! Be still , Catherine Ellen ! You think I 'm lying ! Cathie said solemnly . You think I 'm being untruthful when I say I saw that vision upstairs ! It was like the Armies of God ! Be still ! cried Aunt Sarah . On your knees before the wrath of a merciful God and still your tongue with these blasphemies against His wonders ! I wo n't ! I wo n't ! And she tore free from Aunt Sarah 's embrace like something uprooted by wind and the lightning blazed and lit us all , silvering the wild faces of Aunt Sarah and the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder drowned . ? not one of us ! Aunt Sarah was screaming when the boom subsided . I say that you are not one of us ! We are Christian people and we pray in the face of storms ! No ! cried the girl . It 's true ! I 'm not one of you ! And I 'm proud of that ! You are the Devil 's own ! Yes ! Yes ! If you say it  --  I am the Devil 's own ! And glad to be ! Let me alone now ! Let me be ! I never did belong and all your saying that I did was lies ! And she turned suddenly , in flight toward the pantry stairs , and the lightning failed but the etched shape of her stayed in my eyes when the darkness clamped back around us . What 's all the shouting ? cried Uncle Joe , stamping his cane sharply on the floor . Be still . A body ca n't hear the storm with you women caterwauling !  | Let me go , Aunt Sarah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me with my fingers but it was locked round me . Be still , Thomas . The storm has n't even begun ! I want to go upstairs . Thomas , be still ! You will stay here . We will remain together until the storm is over ! No , Aunt Sarah ! What ? I want to go upstairs . And I saw her face , agape and speechless at this mutiny , as the window lit again and shone upon us like a bursting moon . To be with her ? she said . She does n't understand , I said . She did n't mean ? . She understands nothing because she is not and never has been one of us . She is not a Christopher and I do n't even think she is a Christian . She 's got that mean Hornbrook blood in her . Let me go , Aunt Sarah , I said again , not angry , but swinging down free of the rigid angle of bone and flesh and bombazine that ringed me in . Thomas Christopher , how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist ! she cried harshly above the crashing rain . Hear Him , Thomas ! He is a God of vengeance ! You are a man now , Thomas Christopher , and not a boy and He will hold you accountable  --  He who knows of every sparrow 's fall ! Where are you going ? I stared wild at her , clench-fisted and frightened beyond the telling . She has n't got anybody ! I screamed above the rain , above the wind . Ca n't you understand that in your Christian mind ! Ca n't you ! She has n't got anybody ! Do n't you see ! Please ! Please , Aunt Sarah ! Call her back ! God wo n't mind ! She was not even looking in my direction now : her face had lifted again to the window as if awaiting the blazing entrance of Jehovah . I ran up the stairs to Cathie 's room and saw her on the bed with the paper and the pencil , stretched out on her belly with her face to the rain on the quartered panes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not move and I saw that she was waiting for the  | lightning to see to make a word on the paper  --  square black words from the tip of the broken pencil in her fist . Cathie ! I screamed , beating my fist against the door jamb . Come back down stairs ! Do n't make us be apart ! But she was not hearing , her pencil poised and ready to spring upon the paper and write when the lightning came again . Cathie , listen to me ! Turn around and look at me ! Cathie ? I was afraid of her then : or more afraid perhaps that once I crossed that threshold to her room I would have cast my lot irrevocably and deserted these rooms which had sheltered me in the old , beloved safeties that I could not name ; crossed the threshold from childhood into the time of man . I leaned against the sill and closed my eyes and thought : Aunt Sarah will call to me in a minute and when she does I will go back downstairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was midnight when the storm subsided and passed us because the clock chimed , its own voice somehow breathless with aftermath and the whole house lay basking and spent in the peace of the rain-sound and the drip of it outside seemed the gentle pulse of something safe , while far away , behind the hills , the thunder brawled and muttered in the foaming flash-floods of the backland hollows . I was sitting beside her on the carpet stool , watching her face in the darkness on that bed where old Rebecca had died , in that little room with its cold , curious breath . What was it you wrote ? I said presently . A letter , she sighed . It 's sure a funny night to write a letter . No , she said . I had to . I just had to write a letter about the storm . And my vision . The white armies I saw ! She was still a while and I heard her folding the paper quietly and slipping it into her dress again . Your Aunt Sarah does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pshaw ! She do n't mean half she says ! No , she said . I do n't blame her . I 'm queer , Tom . I ca n't help it ! I just have to do things sometimes and I do n't know why . I tried to tell everybody how beautiful it was ! And she said it was a blasphemy against Him . And Lord , Tom ! How could it be ! It was Him that made it ! You 'd think she 'd see ! She does n't believe in that God , I reckon .  | There 's not but one . I know , I said . I know . But sometimes even I 'm not sure . Sometimes it 's just like I can hear Him up there in the room where Grandpa Christopher died  --  rockin ' and rockin ' . It was beautiful ! she said to herself and her voice was like a bright grass woven with the rain-sound . And I just had to write a letter to somebody . I reckon he 'll understand when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was still a while , thinking I suppose . It was n't written to Abijah , she sighed . I would n't know where to send a letter to Abijah if I wrote it . It was just a letter . Not a letter to somebody . But you do n't just write letters  --  unless they 're to somebody . I know , she said . I 'm queer and strange . No , I said . I reckon a body could write a letter that was just a letter . Yes , she said . That 's what it was . Just a letter . I just wish there was somebody I could really write a letter to . I think writing letters is so beautiful  --  do n't you , Tom ? Well , I suppose  --  I reckon so ? . Yes , I do . Do n't you ever get so tight inside  --  the way a rooster must feel before he crows . You just get so full of things and there 's only one thing to do  --  write a letter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows sprang up in the black house as Aunt Sarah sent Toot through the hall lighting lamps and candles and uncovering the mirrors . I wondered what she would say to us . Listen , Cathie . Do n't mind what she said about  --  about your not belonging with us . She gets queer when there 's a storm . No , she said . It 's true . I do n't belong . I never did , Tom . But I do n't mind . I 've got things inside that make it all right . I reckon I 'd mind it pretty awful if I did n't have Abijah . But just the same  --  do n't pay her no mind . But she was right , Tom . And God will punish me . I know that and I do n't mind . When a body knows a thing is fair  --  they do n't mind so bad . Now Uncle Joe 's cane thumped faintly down the hall rug in the house below and I judged from the copper clatter in the pantry that  | Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drip and gurgle of the steady downpour , the thunder hunched and growled like an angry dog beneath the house . Do n't worry about nothing , I said , and put my hand on her head . She did not cringe nor move away and yet I felt her scalp quiver beneath my fingers and the spasm seemed to run clean to her heels . She sat a while longer with the letter in her hand : that letter to no one , to everyone , a letter to the Lord Himself . But there was no address on it : there was nothing but the bare envelope , and inside it the words that she had written by lightning and wonder . Now she tore her stare from the dark window and looked at me in quiet anguish . I 've been feeling it for weeks now , she said . Knowing that something  --  something bad was going to happen to me . Pshaw ! She never meant nothing by all that ? . Yes . She meant what she said . And it was true . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunty , too  --  took us in that time . I mind it all and I am beholden . She done it because it was Christian . I am beholden . Well , sure you are ! But you have to keep remembering that she 's old and queer . We stopped talking then and listened as Aunt Sarah came slowly up the hall stairs : we awaited her like prisoners at the bar , with no sound but her just , soft tread and the gentle sighing groan of the great house , still tired from the storm 's ordeal , and the dripping of the long night rain . Catherine Ellen ? Yes 'm . Thomas ? Yes 'm . She came to the doorway with the old tin candlestick and the dripping tallow taper and the wavering flame-shine painting the tired lines of her peaked face . Go to bed , children , she said in a soft hoarse voice . And she was gone , dragging the shadows behind her and I knew her so well that her not saying anything to us about our pantry rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing until tomorrow  --  perhaps not until Sunday  --  perhaps not for a week or a month . She would keep the wound covered and bound  | and then upon the first occasion  --  snatch away the stained swathing and confront us with it : all the hurt and anger she had saved until that moment . It was worse , I think , when she said nothing and bore her cross like a Christian . Worse , by far . She 's forgot all about it ! I said cheerfully . But Cathie shook her dark locks in a soft rhythm from side to side . No . She has n't . She knows . And I know . He will punish me . In the morning the whole round land shone with a crystal sharpness . The day was clear as cold spring water with slow herds of clouds like sheep upon the sky and summer gone : vanished in that wild metamorphosis of elements that had lashed the valley during the night . Gone , too , was our giant apple tree  --  wrenched in half from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke house , planted there , legend said , by Johnny Appleseed himself , and now tumbled down the slope by the wind like a ball of hay . Aunt Sarah was up in the barn with her parasol , poking slates and lath and shingles to see if the storm had unsettled them . And Cathie stood watching in the pantry window in sullen and aggrieved dignity as Coy came up the meadow in the buckboard with a sack of flour from Carly Juniper 's . My fear that the storm had done damage to the Nellie Queen was so strong that I dared not even mention it to Cathie . But she seemed to read my thoughts . She was n't hurt by it , she whispered . Who ? The Nellie Queen , she said . You went all the way up there to see ? No . I went and looked  --  up in the attic . I went there before daylight and when the sun come up I saw the first light of it shine on the pilot-house windows . I could count every pane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said . Do n't look so miserable . She sighed and would not look at me . A body ca n't be very cheerful , she said , when they know they 've got a punishment coming . A judgment . Pshaw ! She wo n't punish you . I do n't mean her , she said . Who then ? I said , and she shook her head and looked away .  | I can feel it gathering in my flesh , Tom . I was impudent and ungrateful to her when I should have been beholden . Abijah would be ashamed of me . Tom ! Tom , it just made me so  --  so wild ! I just went crazy when she kept saying it was a lie  --  what I saw ! Torn , it was n't just the rain ! Do n't you believe me ? Yes . And she said it was sacrilege ! Oh , maybe it was . Maybe I am the Devil 's own ! Oh , Tom , I could just die ! But she did n't cry then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that I saw at least . She stood with face tilted high to the window , to the light of morning and her lip sucked in ; eyes as wild as a filly at her first taste of bit : standing there a-quiver with a little pulsing heart-sign in her milky throat . Let 's have a game ! I said suddenly , desperately , an hour or so later : grappling to pull her from these deeps . What kind of game ? she said numbly . I took the letter from her fingers and she did not even seem to know it : her wild eyes did not even turn . Let 's give Toot this letter and tell her Coy brought it from town ! Tell her it 's got her name on it ! I do n't care what you do with it , she said . I just do n't care . It 'll be a joke , I said . Because Toot ca n't even read her name and she 's always teasing us ! I do n't care , Tom . Do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But do n't you see ? It 'll be the best old joke in the world ! Go ahead . I do n't care . The pantry was wild-smelling and steamy from the kettle of bubbling strawberries brawling and stewing on the stove . Cathie turned and sat straight in the cane chair by the door . Her eyes were dark : seeing and not-seeing , and her mouth a ghost of pink . Now ne'mind gettin ' under foot , you scampy trunnel-bed trash , whilst I 'm tannin ' dese hyer strawberries fo ' yo ' Aunt Sary ! I sho do n't want no chilluns under my feet this morning ! But look , Toot ! I said , holding up the white envelope and waggling it under her nose . What 's dat ? It 's a letter Coy brought from the post office  --  that 's what ! And it 's got your name on it ! I do n't see no name on it !  | Well , it 's got your name in it ! That 's the important thing ! Dear Toot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it up to the light in the parlor window is how ! Pshaw ! Ai n't nobody ever wrote my name down ! How you know it if you seen it ? A T and two goose eggs and another T ! That 's plain enough ! Pshaw ! Lemme see now ! Shoot ! And she snatched it from me and held it a half inch from her nose , squinching up her poor , nearsighted eyes . I be dogged if I see nothin ' with no double goose eggs on hit ! Open it up ! I said . It 's for you and that 's for sure . ' Cause Coy said so ! How he know ! ' Cause Carly Juniper told him  --  that 's how ! Carly said that letter came in the mornin ' mail off the Julia Dean and the Cap 'm said be sure to see you got that letter ! I glanced aside at Cathie to see if the game had kindled in her face yet , but she sat sallow and glum as ever : her eyes dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toot , meanwhile , had fixed me in a pecking stare of most henlike scrutiny , sniffing and suspicious , fetching the bubbling strawberries a lick with the long wood spoon every moment or so . Coy had gone up into the north pasture for the day and so there was no way he could verify my tale  --  nor deny it . Pshaw ! Who 'd be writin ' me a mail letter ! The Lord only knows , I said darkly , and smothered a giggle . The Lord only knows . I reckon He do . And that do n't noways call for you takin ' His name in vain neither ! I reckon I better open dis hyer letter and read what hit say ! Pshaw ! I teased . You ca n't read ! Who say I ca n't read ! Hit was your own dead mother taught me to read , Thomas Christopher , long long ago ! ' Pshaw ! Hit 's a fack , boy ! I can read as good as de Preacher ! I felt the smile go foolish on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . I bet you ca n't ! But she had snatched the reins now and was riding the joke like a high , wild horse in maddening circles round me.  | Sho ! she cried and tore the white envelope open and fetched out the letter and held it to her nose and peered and grunted and squinched her eyes and moaned a little and clicked her tongue with amazement at what she pretended to see there , and then lowered her gaze to stare at me , eyes a-mocking . Sho ! You ca n't read ! I be dogged if I ca n't . I did . Who 's it from then ? Maybe I ai n't sayin ' ! Because you do n't know . You ca n't read it ! You ca n't ! Be dogged if I ca n't . I done did . Then who 's it from ? It 's from a mighty old man . A man older than you 'll ever grow to be , judgin ' from your orneriness ! Who ? You 'll know his name when I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now : wild ; caught like a sparrow in hunter 's bird-lime and my stick legs strained in the gum to be a-flying again . Who ! Who ! You heard his name in de Book many times . Hit was him dat built de Ark ! Pshaw ! That 's not a letter from him ! From Master Noah ! Sho ' t is ! It 's not ! Sho ' t is ! Suse came in with baskets of strawberries from the ice house ? the sweet flesh of them pink and glowing in the straw . Looky hyer , sister ! cried Toot , waving the letter in Suse 's face . Looky what come on de mornin ' packet ! A letter from Master Noah ! Sho nuff ? whispered Suse who would believe anything : that fool . Sho ! Got his name wrote down plain as in de Book . Cap 'm Noah , Master of de Ark ! I be dogged ! said Suse . Lemme see hyer , sister ! No , by jimminy ! cried Toot , stirring the berries with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosy steam . Dis hyer 's my letter and ai n't nobody gets der hands on it ! What 's hit say ?  | Lemme read it and see . Sho ! Lemme see now . Hit says dat Master Noah had a talk with the Lord God Jehovah not three days ago ! Hallelujah ! sang Suse softly and set the berries on the canning bench . And what He say ! Say He gettin ' mighty sick and tired of the evil , sinful , mean and contrary ways of two chill'n named Catherine Ellen Hornbrook and Thomas Christopher ! Sho null ? Sho ! Hit 's writ here plain to see ! I fetched a box and sat down beside Cathie 's stiff , silent figure in the cane-bottom chair . The sweet smell of the pantry and the spice of my joke had gone to sourness and fear . And even Cathie was listening now : her eyes watching Toot with grave and grieving quiet . Yes , Cathie breathed . It 's true , Tom . We are a poor sight in the eyes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped : reason did not help , telling myself that Noah was a man gone to dust before the eyes of the warrior had stared through the copper mask even . Nothing helped . Toot had won the game and I was growing sick with dread for I would have sworn in that moment that the letter had come from God Himself had she said so and declared that His bright seal shone like a sun upon the innocent paper . Master Noah say de Lord God Jehovah gettin ' mighty sick and tired of trunnel-bed trash mockin ' po ' ignorant niggers ! Sassin ' der Aunt Sarys , too ! Master Noah say de Lord God Jehovah fixin ' to come a-ridin ' on His chariot and smite dem rascals whar hit 'll do de most good ! Cathie stood up like someone struck by the curse of a witch and wandered off , dumb and eyes lacklustered , into the darkness of the hallway . Cathie , wait ! Sho ! She knows de Judgment is a-comin ' ! Sho now ! Shut up ! Shut up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I be dogged if hit 's a lie ! Suse giggled and fetched a cup of sugar from the hogshead and giggled again . You ca n't read ! I screamed . Sho I can read ! Can you ? No ! But I know who wrote that letter ! She did ! Who did ? Master Noah did !  | He did n't ! He did n't ! Cathie wrote it ! I be dogged if she did ! Did n't you say yo'self it come in de mail on de mornin ' packet ? Did n't you say yo'sef it come by Coy 's hand to de house ? Did n't you say yo'sef dat Carly juniper tol ' him ? Give it to me ! I be dogged ! And she held it behind her and would not give it up and all I could do was stand there before her , impotent and raging . Thomas Christopher , you want me to tell yo Aunt Sary you been lyin ' to me ? No . And she could have done just that , for Aunt Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her , with the yellow parasol folded and fluttering like a golden hen in her hands . Thomas , leave Suse and Toot be ! They 've got their hands full with canning today ! Where 's Catherine Ellen ? She  --  she ? . Where is she ? Do n't mumble your words , boy ! She went upstairs , I reckon . I think she 's sick . Sick ? Sick from idleness like as not . That 's a sickness , Thomas , and you 've caught it , too ! Run fetch her . I went her to help scald the stone jars ! Yes 'm . No , wait ! She stood , stiffening suddenly : straight and stark as a ship 's mast and the morning light shone in the worn velvet of her old bonnet and her mouth moved softly in dumb dread as her eyes widened at those few faint scarlet splatters on the floor . Dear God , it 's come . What 's come ? I whispered . Who ? ? The stain of mortality , she whispered , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaking white knuckles , her eyes glazed and unwinking on the floor . The shame of Lilith . And I looked again at that faint dappling of crimson where , only moments before , Cathie 's numb cold feet had wandered stricken and cursed from the room : the tiny splattering of blood that marked her passing from more than a room , from more than a summer : a passing from innocence into the thorns beyond Eden . Suse and Toot stopped and stared too , and then went back to stirring the bubbling pot and made no more of the joke that had been our common downfall  | that forenoon . Aunt Sarah walked out into the hallway and I heard her feet whisper up the creaking staircase . What 's wrong ? I whispered to Suse and Toot . Is Cathie bad sick ? But they would pay me no mind , would not even turn from the stove to face my question and there seemed to be a blood-scent of shame weaving among those sweet aromas of cooking things : the fragrance of the berry harvest like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoor of the snake . I went to the foot of the steps and listened and heard Aunt Sarah in the clothes press tearing up strips of clean linen she kept there for reasons that had always been to me a mystery : cloths I was forbidden ever to touch . I started up the stairs and she heard me and came to the head of the steps and beckoned me back with her parasol , her bonnet still incongruously perched atop her head , her face ivory-yellow and drawn beneath it , her eyes dark with something wild and glorious and furious all at once . Go back down , Thomas ! This is woman 's business up here ! Do n't take another step ! I forbid it ! And I stopped and stood there and when she had gone away again I listened and a door slammed and I crept to the highest step and listened again and off behind the door to Aunt Sarah 's room I heard Cathie 's voice high and brave : I do n't mind ! I knew He would punish me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step and put my head against the damp cold paper on the wall and closed my eyes and wondered what would happen to me there alone in that house when she was dead . Because God had struck her as she had known He would  --  as Aunt Sarah had predicted  --  even as Master Noah himself had foretold ? . And I could not get it through my numb wits somehow that the letter had been my joke and not the two-edged teasing Toot had made it be . No , she would die . He had struck her and she was bleeding , and with my eyes closed there I suddenly saw it plain again : the dream of that August night and the killing thing I had done to her . Please God , I prayed , do n't let Cathie die ! Please God , do n't ! Do n't let Cathie die ! And I kept whispering it over and over again while Aunt Sarah 's voice droned on behind the silent door and I made my lips stop making the prayer long enough to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something out loud from the Scriptures  | and Cathie was listening , not making any sound at all , as she silently stood there , I supposed , bleeding to death from the curse of God . Thomas ! I thought I told you to say downstairs . Is she dead ? I stared up at her in the doorway of the room and saw no sign of Cathie in the sunlight from the window behind her . No , she 's not dead . Though it would be a just God that struck every woman dead on this day of her life . Is she bad sick ? Go downstairs , Thomas . I order you ! I 'll run fetch Doctor Willie ! Do as I say , Thomas ! And because there was something female and ancient and dark about the whole business , I obeyed , and spent the whole terrible day in waiting and wondering . I roamed the downstairs and waited , but the door stayed closed and when Aunt Sarah came down she left it latched behind her . That night I waited till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn moonlight in my room and crept to Cathie 's room and opened the door softly and stood for a moment looking for her face and seeing it at last on the bolster , small and livid among dark curls as it had been that other time in the winter when she had fallen so sick . Cathie ? And no sound of breath from her : no sense of living at all . Cathie ? And when I had said it once more I crossed the threshold and stood by her bed . She lay staring at the old pattern of a rain stain on the ceiling and I thought for a moment that she had died . Then her lashes blinked once and she looked at me . Cathie ? Get out . Cathie , I ? . Get out . Ca n't you understand that ? I 'm cursed . She told me I was cursed . She even read it to me in the Book  --  how all women are cursed . Cathie , we 're still friends . I despise you , she whispered wildly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say that no more . Why not ? It 's true . Maybe that 's why God came down and  | punished me ! Maybe He 's not punishing me for the things I said but for the things I did n't say ! All these years I 've hated you and I 've hated her , too . Cathie , do n't keep saying that ! I will ! I will ! I 'll say it till the last breath in me is gone ! Beholden ! Beholden ! I 've always had to be beholden for everything ? to her  --  to you  --  to them niggers in the pantry ! And your Aunt Rebecca ? . Yes ! Yes , she was beholden too ! She died in this bed beholden ! Shamed and crawling and beholden ! And she was just as good as your Aunt Sarah ever was ! Ever ! Ever ! Shut up . I wo n't ! Throw me out . I 'll walk the roads and sleep in haystacks till Abijah comes back . I 'll be beholden to no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleeping like the winter bear , in the rocky caverns of my heart : all the old , wild hatred of that first winter . The truce of childhood was ended and I suddenly knew that it had been a lying , cheating thing from its outset : that I had always hated her with that same ardor that had burned me that first day she and Rebecca had come into our pantry breathless and pinkcheeked from the winter roads . But now she was smiling and squinteyed with malevolence as she looked at me again . I only hope God makes you suffer as He has made me suffer tonight . I hope it and I pray it and I would sell my soul to the Devil if I could make sure you would crawl and cringe in the shame and filth and cursedness I 've had put on me this day ! You deserved it ! Yes ! Yes ! I deserved it ! Now get out ! she whispered . I hope you die , Catherine Ellen Hornbrook ! I hope you die ! I hoped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words ; her knuckle hard in her teeth . All day today ! Prayed for it ! But I wo n't die yet ! No , God 's got some more tricks stored up for me yet ! He 's not done with His deviling me ! Shut your mouth ! That 's blasphemy ! My tongue 's my own ! I 'll say what I 've a mind to ! And tomorrow Aunt Sarah will drive you out in the road where you came from ! ? where you always belonged ! I choked then on the fury of my dry mouth and was silent , and the terrible hissing , whispering struggle was ended , and Cathie returned her dark stare to the stain on the ceiling as if I were no longer  | even in the world . And suddenly all breath and spunk were gone from me and I crept back to my bed , weak and sick as an autumn wasp , and crawled under the quilt and lay awake long past the clock 's third chiming and heard those hushed sobs from somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffled cry faintly to the still moon meadows and listened when he grew quiet for a spell , prowling the black morning , and listened when , at last , he dropped and something up in the orchard screamed like a penny whistle and died . And then there was no listening but to that far , faint gasp of grieving and I lay waiting , in my turn , for the feathered , soundless fall and filled my mouth with quilt and bit it hard to keep from screaming when it came .  | Can you forgive me , Thomas ? There 's nothing to forgive , Aunt Sarah ! You 've always done your best in raising me . I never made any complaint . Ah , that 's so ! And I 'm glad you know it  --  or at least say it . And yet I think I 've been a mite harsh sometimes . With you and with her , too . I kept my teeth together at that mention and looked out the kitchen window at the morning hoar like a beard of age on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believed , I said , still not looking at her . And I reckon my own mother could have done no better . Ah , you 're a good boy , Thomas ! I do n't know what comes over me sometimes . With all the bitterness round about these days a body gets to thinking . The times has nothing to do with Right and Wrong . That 's something that do n't change . Just the same , boy , I 'd think you might at least speak to her . At meals , at least . I bit my teeth together in silence . Yes . That 's only Christian , she said . low as how you 've got no right to censure me on that , at least On bein ' a Christian . No , she said softly , staring at the knotted rough wool in her hands , the taut heel she was mending across the skull of the darning gourd . Do n't mistake my meaning , Thomas . You 've been a good boy . And you 're a good man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , and that 's saying a good deal because your Grandfather ? . And I 'm not ashamed before him neither ! All my life I 've kept in  | mind that he 'd be judging me  --  somewhere  --  and I 've tried to live by that . No no , boy ! Now be still till I finish . We 're a strange family , I know , and it 's not easy to live up to the standards set by them that 's dead and gone . And her  --  she 's strange  --  queer ! Because I 've told you time and again about her blood  --  the Hornbrooks  --  the father and all . Queer ! I 'd as soon not talk about her . Queer ! Let me finish . I 'm an old woman and I like to talk so shut your mouth for a minute and hear me out ! I just mean to say that living under the same roof  --  eating at the same table  --  seeing one another in the rooms of an evening , in the same light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't natural for two young people to live like that and not say one mortal friendly word in a whole year 's time . I 'm not obliged to talk when I 've got no words to say . No  --  that 's not the heart of it , boy ! There was words a-plenty between the two of you for all them years when you was both growin ' ? shapin ' into the man and woman you are now . Thomas , strange as the girl is I think you should try to speak to her civilly  --  genteelly . I chewed my lip and cracked my knuckles and stared hard at the space in the pantry floor between those boards that had grown sleek and dark beneath a century 's whispering feet and the scouring suds of Toot 's hickory broom . I 've got no words to say . I think the Lord would want you to think of her as if  --  as if you were a father . I looked at her now , furious , and yet afraid to let her see . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always said as how her family was trash and ours the salt of the earth ? Thomas , you 're twistin ' perfectly good words into nonsense . I never said you was her father . I said you should try to treat her as that  --  out of common Christian custom . She 's care-kin , at least . I doubt that . She seems mighty independent these days . Ah , Lord , I reckon I 'm to blame for it . It all began that night of the storm  --  when she was impudent . She blasphemed . You said that yourself . She was scared . Storms scare me , too . I 'll not deny it . She never meant what she said . And she longs for that shiftless Hornbrookthat Abijah . I forgave her . Long ago I forgave her for that night , Thomas . Why ca n't you ?  | I do n't know . I got up and jammed my hands to the wrists in my britch pockets and stared into the crazy black branches of the winter apple tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Sarah . Pshaw , Thomas ! It 's so . I never thought I 'd live to see the day when you 'd be takin ' up for her this way . She laid her darning down and I heard her skirts whisper their dry , breathing stride across the room and she put her hands on my shoulders and drew me round . It 's the times , I reckon , she said . There 's so much meanness goin ' round . I ca n't expain it somehow . It seems to me sometimes like all the old good things are slipping away . Now that I 've decided to have your Uncle put away ? . When did you decide that ? Last Sunday . I talked for a good hour with Pastor Cockayne . I told him what I 'd done for Joe  --  all these years  --  these wasted years . Not that he do n't know . Lord , he 's watched it with his own eyes and he told me he had prayed for me many 's the time  --  wondered how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent ? To the Home at Wheeling . That 's a lunatic asylum . That 's a cruel word for it , Thomas , she smiled . Your Uncle 's a man that needs tending  --  more than I can give him . But he 's not crazy . Not crazy ? Have you had to lay beside him of a night and cringe while he thrashed in the bed and called the name of my dead child ? It was his child , too . You 're a cruel boy , Thomas . You 'd never talk to me like that if you was n't . It 's the truth . Yes . Yes , it 's the truth . And it 's the truth that he 's soaked his brains in those medicines of his till he 's little more than a dope fiend . Pshaw . Them Injun herbs . Injun herbs nothin ' . I found a vial of laudanum in his shirt pocket when I sorted the wash last Monday . But that 's not for you to judge . But it 's all part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reckon I 'm getting old and queer myself . I reckon they 'll be sending me off one of these days  --  maybe you yourself will send me , Thomas .  | Do n't say that , Aunt Sarah . Well , it 's true . I 've tried to be a good wife to Joe . I 've tried to raise you up as if you were my own  --  washed in like a half-drowned bird from the river . And the girl , too ! ? tried to make you both Christian . Lord , it 's not been easy . It 's not been easy . She turned away from me and I felt the old wash of shame that I had wronged her , but there was nothing I could say yet . I just ca n't abide it , she said . The feeling of hate that hangs in the air of this house sometimes . It 's like a cake burning in the oven  --  a scorched sweetness . Some Wednesdays when I open the windows to air the rooms I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . But when I shut the windows  --  it 's there again . I hate no one . You hate her , she said , and then suddenly turned to me and stared hard into me with black prying eyes . Do n't you ? I do n't know , I said , and suddenly I began to speak despite myself and I said more than a mouthful , for it had been storing there a long time ; working like mash . I do n't know what I ever really felt about her . Sometimes when I look back to that day when you took her and Rebecca in I ca n't mind exactly what it was like  --  the color of the sky  --  the way either of them looked . It 's a queer thing  --  there 's whole patches of time in them years that are blank and empty as that sky yonder in the window . Sometimes I try to bring the feelings back but it 's just like they was cut out of me like pictures scissored from the page of a book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man that would turn his sister and daughter out in the winter  --  into the roads . More than that . I kept seeing how I 'd feel  --  if I was her . As ye do it unto the least of these , my brethren ? . No , do n't quote Scriptures at me . Not now . Not yet . I know what you mean and I reckon that 's what it was but there 's too much evil in me now for that . It 's been that way since the night you sent her to her room  --  the night there was blood on the floor yonder where God had struck her . I never walk over that floor there that I do n't feel it . Like something burning my naked soles . She lowered her eyes and went back to the rocker and caught up the darning egg again and squinted to the winking steel needle . Not just her , she said softly . Ary one of womankind . No , I said . I did n't get that meaning from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should have told me that . I thought it was her alone that He 'd singled out in His wrath . Did He strike you , too ? Did you bleed ? I dislike this talk , Thomas . The Lord will disclose these things to you in His time . That would have been the time , I said . Then I 'll say it and I want no more talk about it and no more questions . That night was the night that Catherine Ellen became a woman . You said the Lord had struck her . I said that and I say it again . He struck her as He has struck every woman since the Fall of Eve . With blood and shame and sin . I studied a spell and remembered her own voice saying the same words to me that night : that black night when the river owl had killed that little crying thing . My mother , too ? Every woman . But you said she was the Devil 's own . It was you that drove her away from you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was all part of it , Aunt Sarah . Those whole four days were like a whirlwind . Yes , we have none of us been the same since then , she said . It 's been a house where you could scent the hatred like a spoor . It 's her that hates , I said with tight aching lips . Not me . Not you either . But it 's the true Christian that loves his enemy . That 's why I say you should try to be more kindly , Thomas . Think of the girl as your daughter . Not blood kin , mind you . No . I 'll not . I ca n't . Because I know how it would be . It would be fighting again and it would n't be children fighting this time . It was bad enough when we were neither of us big enough nor ornery enough to do much more than bloody each other 's noses . I know what it would be next time we fought . What ? I covered my eyes with my fists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew like stars in a mist . I do n't know . God above , will you let me be , Aunt Sarah ! I 'm trying to understand you , Thomas . I do n't know what it would be . Sometimes I dream about it !  | I hear you cry in your sleep sometimes . Yes . And I reckon she hears me , too . And I reckon that 's something for her to laugh at . I seen that in her face , too , at supper or here in the pantry . Oh , do n't think we ai n't been talkin ' all this time ? her and me ! There 's been no words . But there 's been talk a-plenty . I pass her sometimes on the stairs and I see such a mocking and a laughing in her eyes that I could kill her . Sometimes I catch her starin ' at me during the meal . Do n't tell me you have n't seen that , Aunt Sarah ! Lord , there 's been talk a-plenty . Eye-talk ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas . It was always her that won when we fought , you see ! Even when I whipped her it was her that won . Even that night when she drove me out of her room . Then you went there ? Yes . Yes . You never knew . I knew . There 's a lot of things I knew that I never said . I held my tongue for the sake of Peace . At any rate , she drove me out of the room  --  her mouth was twisted and foul with the Devil 's own blasphemies . She has n't been the same since then . And I do n't reckon I have either . That 's why I know what it would be if I even spoke to her now . We 'd be at each other 's breasts like pit dogs . Mercy mercy mercy ! she sighed . Why does He put us here on this earth ? It 's like a war . Like a war . Sometimes , I said so softly that my own voice seemed to come from beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold crystal winds of that river winter . Sometimes I have a dream about her , Aunt Sarah . What 's the dream ? I do n't know , Aunt Sarah . Pshaw ! A body can remember a dream . I ca n't say ! I said , blushing scarlet with all the blood in me burning my face . Except that there 's a shame  --  a pollution comes with it . I reckon I 'd best have Doctor Willie have a talk with you . No ? that drunken sot . And Joe 's not fit . Mercy , how can a woman survive in a world with no men . Lord , if my strong , good father were alive . He 'd tell you the facts of things . What facts , Aunt Sarah ? Am I sick ? Sick with the sin of the world . That 's a sickness , Thomas . And what is she to you in this dream ? ? a daughter ?  | I ca n't remember ! Damme ! Thomas , I will not tolerate cursing in my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's Him that will decide that . Go on , Thomas . It 's  --  it 's killing , I think ! Yes , it 's killing . Killing who ? I  --  I ? her . Her ! Her ! Ahhh . Then you must pray to Him for strength . I 'm prayed out . I 've prayed till my whole body feels like I 've been bled . Sometimes I feel just like I 'm praying to an empty room . No . He hears you . But I could not go on ; could not say the words that came shaped and deadly to my tongue : that I sometimes thought God had died and that I might as well be speaking to the rocking chair in that room or to my own bleak , gaunt image in his darkened mirror : to the shock of brown hair above my scared , white face ; or that I might as well go to the hill by Dulcie 's house and sit in the flesh-fed grass amid those mute stones and talk to the wind among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark girl walk among the trees of my Grandfather 's orchard . It was settled then in the second week of November that Doctor Willie was to come in the rockaway buggy on Wednesday morning and fetch Uncle Joe off to the asylum at Wheeling . I will never know if Aunt Sarah 's charge was a fair one : that he was insane or a dope fiend or to what sore tests he had put their marriage in those decades before my time . In my childhood he had seemed , in that household of gods , to be the God of Three-Penny Pieces : no more than that . He had never charmed me with the outspoken , hearty bluster of Doctor Willie . He had frightened me more than most of the older people in my child 's world , more even than Aunt Sarah , because he talked to ghosts while she only talked to God and God , at least , never left his rocker to prowl the panels of the hallways , to creep and clatter among the joists and whistle a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up to her and arraigned her roundly for the decision and would not sign the papers that declared Uncle Joe incompetent and insane and she sent for an effeminate young doctor named Fred Baum from Wheeling and he did the deed . And perhaps  | they were right . I felt no loss nor pity at knowing that he was going . He had always seemed remote from me , and in my childhood I remembered that his favorite had not been I but a whisper and the flutter of a curtain and the name of a child named Peggy who sometimes shook down sickle pears on my head on ghosty , gusty days in the orchard . Yet I went , half out of curiosity , to see him , finally , in the parlor , as he sat feeling for the last time against his face the fading of the dusk of that habit-worn window . Tom ? Is that you , boy ? Yes , Uncle Joe . Come set with me , boy . He would never believe that I was a man now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me sit on the stool beside his chair and reach out his hand to feel my face and it would strike against my breast : he believed that I was still a child five hands high . Tom , did ye hear ? She 's sending me away ! Yes . She told me , Uncle Joe . He made a sound and I flashed him a look because it was as much a sob as a chuckle and I saw that it was both , and neither . Lawk ! Just like an old dray carted off to the boneyard ! Ai n't that the way ! I heard , I lied , that it was comfortable up there . Just like an old wind-broke horse ! he went on in that rambling , faint-voiced way . And what will my poor Peggy do now ! Pshaw ! That young sawbones from up river told her I was crazy , boy ! Do n't that beat all ? He said I 'd took dope till my brains was just like an old worm-eaten stump in the woods ! Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gummed a few more wandering words and shook his head in disbelief . Will Curtis said my brains was sound as hers ! Sounder ! Hah ! That shook her whalebone stays a little ! There 'll be folks up there , I said , to take good care of you , Uncle Joe . Pshaw ! Did n't I always take care of myself ! And her , too , when I had my eyes  --  when I had the store ! And then  --  and then ? . He turned his head a little , listening , harking always for sounds my ears would never hear . The Captain hated me , he said softly . And that 's why she hates me , too .  | Grandfather Christopher ? Hated me from the day I set foot in this house . Hated me when I took his dear Sary away . Hated me till the night he died upstairs . And let me tell you a thing , boy  --  I hated him , too , because he was just like her  --  sick . Sick ? Sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than herprayin ' and setting stiff-backed in his chair with the Scriptures on his knee . Lightning would not have struck him down from that chair when he prayed ! I hated him . A body needs religion . Not that kind . Not that much . A body needs to pray , I whispered , hoping that no one would hear us there and yet somehow entranced with his talk . I seemed never to have known him before and I had a curious new kind of despair at the prospect of his leaving . And when at last he come to die he went on  --  he lay yonder in the shiny box with candles round him  --  candles at his head and candles at his side and candles at his feet . Lord , how still the house was that night  --  even the mice was still  --  even the crickets that used to live in the pantry was still . There was n't no sound in that whole night but her a-sobbin ' in her room . Think of it , boy ! Sarah Christopher sobbin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll vow you 'll not see it again . And his face twisted and he wept but no tears came from the driedup lids and after a while he stopped suddenly and began speaking again as if nothing had happened . I 'd been to Elizabethtown with Will Curtis that night , he said . Will and me and Captain Dorcas from the steamboat Bird of the Prairie got drunk with old Jabez Koontz , the wharfmaster . I come in about seven in the evening and I seen him lyin ' there  --  still proud and no stiffer in death than he 'd been in life  --  in that shiny box ? with his beard pointing to heaven like a pilot 's compass needlelyin ' there with them candles at his head , candles at his feet , candles on either side . I seen them hands  --  still shaped in the clasp of prayer on his stiff linsey coat  --  and her up in the bedroom sobbin ' . Mind ye , boy ! Sary Christopher cried ! That face of wood with tears comin ' out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantry among all them stone jars of food the neighbor women had brought and nobody to dish her out a meal . Ay , boy ! I stood there in the door  --  thick with  | Monongahela rye and puffin ' on a good black stogy  --  and I done the deed that marked the rest of my life . Ay , I did ! He chewed his mustaches for a spell and then snatched the shawl ends close around his armpits and grunted . I seen him lyin ' there in that box and I knowed he could n't never glare at me again  --  could n't never stare me down with his pride and his soft , cold talk of righteousness again ! Boy , I teetered back on my boot heels proud as a rouster and I hollered out : " Cap 'm ! Come have a drink with me ! " Oh , Lordy , she heard that ! You bet your britches she did . But I never minded . It was just me and him in the whole world right then . Because I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the gumption otherwise . And I stood there a spell longer puffin ' smoke into the air of that death-still room and then I swaggered right up to them candles by his side and I stood there a spell longer and I belched , and I said : " Cap 'm ! ' Pears like your hearin ' ai n't what it use to be ! " And he never said a word  --  bein ' as he was dead , you see ! Dead and stretched out there in that shiny fine box with all them candles round him in the gloom . And then you know what I done ? No , I whispered in a trance . It was the drink , I tell you , boy ! I would n't never have had the gumption without it . Good drink it was , too ! Cap 'm Dorcas had rolled a barrel of good Monongahela off his boat that mornin ' ? fresh from Pittsburgh ! What did you do ? I lifted that whispery white gauze they had stretched all over the box there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And then I leaned down and I blowed tobaccy smoke right square in the Cap'm 's face ! It was the drink , you see ! And when I 'd done that I said loud and clear : " Cap 'm , Sary 'd been a right good woman if it had n't been for you ! But you ruined her for ary man that walks ! Christ Himself could n't ? . Uncle Joe ! ? Christ Himself could n't please her ! " Ay ! I said it . And then I tucked my jacket sleeve up and drawed back and I slapped his cold cheek . I did ! Lord , I could feel that coldness on my fingers for years . I can feel it yet ! Like mutton ! Ever slap a dead man 's cheek , Thomas ? No . Well , then do n't drink ! Do n't fool with it , boy ! Providence might tempt you to slap hers when at last she lies a-coolin ' with candles shinin ' all around ! Hah !  | And did she know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She was standin ' in the parlor door yonder watchin ' me throughout ! Know ! She 's knowed all these years and she 's been waitin ' forty years for the buggy ride I 'm takin ' tomorrow ! Pshaw ! It was like she was married to him  --  her own father ? and our own weddin ' was n't no more than a child 's game . Sure ! She seen it ! Seen me slap him ! Seen me blow smoke in his face . Seen me pinch out all the candles when I 'd done and stared me down when I turned , grinnin ' , and met her face in the black doorway ! Sure ! She waited and kept still till I 'd done it all  --  to the last candle ! Maybe she wanted to see it ! Maybe in her soul she hated him more than me ! Hate and love is just like them Siamese freaks that 's all the talk these days ! I glanced toward the doorway as if I half thought to see her there again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy ! These 'll have to do for a while ! And he fumbled in his shawl and fetched out a squashed black leather bag and pressed it into my hand . Now leave me . She 'll come a-prowlin ' directly and scold you for bein ' up ! It 's long past tom-cattin ' time and a little lad your size needs his sleep to grow on ! He would never know that I had gown . That I was a man now . And I went off , surly at that and forgot the leather bag until I was long a-bed and lay watching the candle shadow of Cathie combing her dark hair  --  the stretching black shape of her on the flowery hall carpet before the door of her small room . And when I remembered I jumped out of bed and fetched the bag from the pocket of my shirt and undid the little string that his old fingers had clumsily knotted around its mouth and dumped it on the quilt  --  two dozen shiny silver bits . And so he had been that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was that that I would always remember him for . Doctor Willie came for him long before daybreak and bundled him into the rockaway and the last sound that I was to hear from him in this mortal life was a plaintive beseeching from the yard that Peggy stay indoors because there was a frost in the air and she would catch her death of cold ; poor wandering thing . November fell on the valley like a black dog . It would be a hard winter : something quickened in the air : a pulse and a drum of cold  | alarm . Every black twig stiffened in the cold of it and the greenwatered river froze white and dry as a bone and the air crackled and splintered like thin , blown glass . I will never know why but it seemed to me in that season that we lived in a house by the sea . Perhaps it was the imminence of that spreading waste of winter , stretching from the very lip of the pantry window to world 's end itself : a vast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheering oven warmth . And sometimes in the high , pure mornings immense clouds came westering down the hills like the grand sail of frigates outward bound , and sometimes there was a true ocean flavor in the air : a salt and a challenge that seemed to me what I had always thought the sea to be . Though I can not say why it so seemed . No more than I can explain those other impressions of strangeness and illusion to that year . Cathie seemed my mortal enemy more than ever before and we kept our silences like passionate , irrevocable vows . Aunt Sarah seemed to have grown stiffened and sharpened and her black eye more watchful now that Uncle Joe was gone . And though I would have denied it then  --  I missed him . It seemed to me a sore and saddening irony that all in the moment of one evening I had first come to know him and last said good-by . Though it was not so much pity at his dismal fate that itched me as an uneasiness that with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so the feeling of strangeness and of danger quickened in the air of the house and I felt my shoulders pressed closer and closer to a final wall . And even the common annual events of the country calendar seemed to bear within them special portents of some wrathful onslaught . Mid-November : the Killing Season . Aunt Sarah bought a good heifer at the Cameron auctions and tethered it in the barn . It cried piteously all that weekend and the two fat shoats skirled and muttered in their frozen pen on the hillside above the smoke house ; seeming almost to guess , at the sight of Noah Lindsay , the butcher , what dark business he had come to attend to on the cold Monday of the Killing . It was a day like clear water with a bright , dry morning star fast fading and the faint sun that hung between the smoking chimneys of Dulcie 's house seemed diminished and stunned and gave no more warmth than a cold daytime moon . We were long out of bed by then , the whole household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and foot . Kettles of water brawled and boiled among small , red , roaring fires in the yard and Noah Lindsay fetched the hard shoats screaming down the hill on the  | sledge , hog-tied and struggling , while the mare tossed her lip and rolled her bald-eyes and smelled death 's onset . And we all stood by the porch , witnessing , while Noah hoisted each shoat in its turn by the hind legs to the breach of the gallows and then , humming loudly in his high , fuzzy voice like a Marietta Dutchman , leveled the cruel hammer and stunned them each with a smart , smacking blow between the ears . The first gave a grunt and said no more but the second uttered a mornful groan and hung like a limp , broken hand as he marched round it , still humming and puffing cheerfully on his corncob , and lifting the great razory blade with a theatrical flourish so that we might all be awed by the single sunflash from its steel , drew it with a gentle , cunning quickness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood fanned out scarlet into the cold , gay air . And then the hard work commenced . By noon we were all smeared as red as Cain himself : blood on our faces , blood to our elbows , blood on our shoes . And no one joked : It was the Killing Season and there was little sound but the hoarse breath of effort and the bubbling song of the kettle and the crackle of the roaring brushfilth fire beneath its black , three-pegged belly , and the hack of the cleaver upon joint and moist bone and cartilage and the scrape of a blade across harsh hide and bristle . Suse and Toot fetched coffee by the gallon and we drank it in the killing cold while the steel flickered and worked in the still flinching flesh and entrails spilled and quivered steaming on the frozen earth , aimlessly busy yet , it seemed , with their wondrous and secret metabolisms . Aunt Sarah  --  dainty and marvelously unbloody in her brown velvet bonnet  --  supervised the business like some fierce druid queen . Catherine ! Help Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And save the tripe ! It will make a meal for Suse and Toot ! Never once in that whole livelong day did Cathie look me in the eyes . Yet her face was flushed amid all that carnage and when I first saw that and sensed it and fairly heard her heart quicken at the sight and scent of blood a strange anger gathered in my breast and a cry began in my throat  --  some challenge , a curse , perhaps  --  and yet I bit it back at that final moment of utterance . It seemed to me that there was in her some knowledge of blood that would ever be denied me . And it was this I hated and could not understand . By three o'clock the business was nearly done and the yard glistened like some primordial abattoir : the blood already black and clotted  | upon the cobbles and in the ruts , the entrails shining and hardened as if they had been carved from alabaster and sapphire and ruby . All four hams had been sheared cleanly away by Noah 's wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid in long , gleaming sides in the smoke house and Toot was grinding sausage already in the pantry by the pump and there was sage in the steamy kitchen air : sweet and bright as summer in our noses . A good heifer ! And good lean shoats  --  the both of them ! cried Aunt Sarah . Four fine hams for next winter ! Leaner than Pharaoh 's swine  --  the both of them ! A good day 's work , Noah ! And she paid him his two silver dollars and a side of spareribs for his day 's killing and he stumped off down the river road into the frozen hoar of the dusk , singing gay as bloody Herod . Now to bed , Thomas  --  Catherine Ellen ! she cried the moment the last supper fork was laid down . Toot and Suse will need help all day tomorrow with the soap ! Tom , we 're short of potash . You 'll take the mare to Elizabethtown at sunup and fetch a bag home . I slumbered away by the firelight in my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bubbling coal behind the grate : seeing in it skies and summer-safety and the green of the warm river running to the sea and small flowers hidden in the black crotch of cool woodlands . Aunt Sarah kept lamps a-shine in downstairs windows on those cursed cold nights ; as if , by some means , their small light might add a warmth to our sanctuary or , perhaps , that their steady lip of flame might stand sentry against the sea of winter ranked against the pane . Each glass was etched and whorled with its own geometry : cold spectral prints of the ghosts of perished leaves and flowers murdered by Old Time and his seasons : white and cruel as the tooth of the fox . And I lay teetering on the warm brink of sleep , swaddled in my mountain of heaped quilts and comforters : some stitched and fashioned by grandmother-hands , older than Injun times and never fetched down from the camphory closets except in these bitter contingencies of winter . I hovered on the warm shore of a dreaming ocean , my lashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the hot hearth . And I dreamed presently . And I could hear my voice off in the world of waking , moaning and whimpering in the silence of the firelight room and I knew all the more that I had to escape because of that and because of something long and bloody and quivering in my hand and because of the thing that had stained it so . Behind me on the bed : Cathie would by lying  | there , I knew : cold and wise-eyed and stately as a slaughtered Princess and that was why I had to flee because she would rise suddenly , in death , and come a-beckoning . A black owl was wheeling and whooping down the frozen clouds above the dream-sea and I heard that far voice of my cry grow louder and I woke wide and felt a square of quilt rip under my fingernails and lay panting and temples thumping and shamed and wild-staring amid the red summer hearth shadows . The hall carpet with its dusty flowers shone with the fireshine from the little grate in Cathie 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bittered , knowing that she had heard my nightmare gaspings and laughed and mocked me , like as not . It was a silence then like the whole world was goose feathers and after a bit I heard the tinkle and puff of the molten cinders and I fell asleep , dreamless at last , hearing the thin , brave bark of a she-fox under the hill where Dulcie lived . Did you sleep well , Thomas ? asked Aunt Sarah , at breakfast , but when I lifted my eyes from the stack of morning buckwheats it was at Cathie that I looked and saw all the mocking there that I had feared would be . Passably well , I murmured and hurried through my breakfast with a thick throat and then bundled up and saddled the roan mare and set off down the river road that was fragile with frost worms and hard as stone . I had not been to Elizabethtown in more than a year and I rode down Lafayette Avenue blushing like a clown thinking that all the changes that year had wrought in me must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in that twelvemonth and it seemed somehow a shameful state and I would turn my eyes to no hollered greetings from the sidewalks because I knew that folks were laughing at my first shadow of a beard and if I spoke they would hear the dark deepness in my voice that was , still strange and new to me . At Carly Juniper 's store the old men clustered round the stove like frost-sick bees around a smoke-pot and they kept their beavers on their heads and their scarves round their chins because the air was cold even there : except in the radiant halo of the roaring , red stove . And these old men spoke little and spat from time to time at the cherry-red stove and watched the juice dance and bead and hiss off into the air . The store seemed to me now what it had seemed to me as a child  | when Coy or Aunt Sarah had brought me there : a palace of wonders . And I had to fight back the need to stare now in a child 's gaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pineapple cheeses and snuff cans and glass jars of cigars : Principes and Cazadores and Stogas and Duke 's Cigarettes and the candies , too , and the smell of it all mingling into a compost that was nothing less than the Spirit of Bounty itself : buckwheat flour and timothy seed and brandy and cinnamon and tonka bean : Spanish leather and the wet , feral aroma of Buffalo robes and coon pelts that the old men had bartered for bacon ; the wandering , sharp ghost of Hartshorn Spirits : acrid and somehow danger-smelling like the scent of horse brine and the bitter-sweet of sarsaparilla and vanilla and wild cherry and pipsissewa and sassafras and the jujube paste that old witches sucked for winter croups . How 's your Aunt Sary , Tom ? Just fine , Mister Juniper ! By grannies , you 've growed up overnight , Tom Christopher ! You 're a half a hand taller than your grandpap already ! I flushed dark as sherry and kept my eyes where they had been from the outset : among the doodads and gimcracks and cheapjack trinkets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons with Jackson 's face like a Roman soldier , the brass whistles and the penny candies and the frog-voiced jew's-harps . I waited with my big wrists a-dangling and my shaved neck a-burning while he fetched the bag of potash and I prayed no one would speak to me again . How 'd your Aunt Sary like the election , Tom ? She never said , I muttered , and blushed some more because none of us had ever known there was an election down in the bottomlands . Well , I do n't reckon it 's a woman 's business to care one way or t' other but I ' low if your Grandpappy Christopher had been around durin ' speech-makin ' time this fall there would n't have been ary single Lincoln vote cast in Marshall County ! I mind back in ' Fortyfour when he went a-stumpin ' up and down the river for Henry Clay ? speakin ' at every landin ' ' tween hyer and Louisville , he did ! Lawk , there was a spellbinder , Tom ! A grand old soul  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrack and tangle of stores behind his counter and I threw him a short , sidelong glance and saw his blue eyes , twinkling behind the little square lenses of his spectacles and his cheek , sagging like a cow 's udder with its burden of  | bitter kitesfoot : that quid that was always there and once when I had come there with Coy for cornmeal I had seen Carly eat his lunch and even then he had not removed the quid but merely shifted it back while he ate his bread and cheese ; and I think he must surely have slept with it just as I am sure he went to bed wearing the stovepipe beaver that he had worn atop his shaggy white head , summer and winter alike , since the last battle of the Mexican War . Hit 's a bad time , Tom ! There 's talk of War ! he cried , seeming to read my thoughts . And now the old men round the stove stirred and scratched their boot soles restlessly on the harsh floor and muttered , waking from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come afore the thaw ! cried the steamboat captain on the bench and shifted his elbows on his knees and blinked at the glowing belly of iron . And there 's good Virginians that 'll welcome the show-down ! Shore ! cried an idle drayman on the bench beside him , and pursed his lips angrily in the thicket of his red beard and winked one wrinkled lid and glared at the captain with the other open eye . Shore ! I 'll throw in with that ! Hit 's time Western Virginians had the horse sense and bull guts to stand up to them damned tide-water , pussy-footin ' gentry with their fancy cotillions and their God-damned taxes . My own Pap  --  God rest his spirit  --  used to tell how them Randolphs and Washingtons used to send calvary clean over into the mountains to gather the taxes at gun-point from pore river folk that hardly had bacon fat to dip their cornbread in ! I say fight ' em ? . That hai n't the issue ! roared the butcher Noah Lindsay from his vantage on the salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' beside if you take that viewpoint and first thing you know the niggers 'll be risin ' like Injuns ? . Shed up , boys ! cried the steamboat captain , raising his hamlike hand for silence . Let 's do n't start nothin ' in Carly 's store . The last time we fit he made us go set out of doors for three days and it 's too blamed cold for that ! And so the butcher and the drayman subsided and brooded a while longer and the drayman struck his palm with his fist and winked to himself as if at some drastic and final inner remark and spat hard against the stove and watched his juice break and fry like a sinner 's blood in hell . Hyer 's your potash , Tommy , cried Carly Juniper and heaved the  | bag onto the counter amid the twinkling jars of French currants and licorice . That 'll be ten cents ! And I went to fetch it and paid him and caught it up , still not meeting the gaze of any of those who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had turned to move toward the door the silence of the street outside was torn by a man 's hoarse scream . By God ! cried the drayman , struggling to his feet and staring toward the window . That sounds like French Marple and his brother 's at it again ! The men came pressing around the door and the windows and shouldered and edged one another like farmers at a boat-show and I , thinking in a sudden , choking panic that something might have happened to Aunt Sarah 's roan , pushed my way through them into the bright cold day . It 's French all right ! cried the pilot in my ear and clamped his big fingers into my shoulder the better to see around it . And there 's Jake and , Lord God , French 's whuppin ' him down the street like a wagon-mule ! My eyes had still not found the object of their talk and I looked around to discover it . Far away at the wharf I saw the towering white lace and the smokeless stacks of the steamboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing like a great white butterfly fixed in hard cake icing . And then I spied the two : far up Lafayette Avenue , beyond the church , beyond the blacksmith 's and the creaking sign of the Mammoth Boot above the Tanner 's place : the man in the black alpaca coat and the black silk hat , moving with what seemed an infinite and stately grace among the ruts of the frozen street , stepping delicately among the icy puddles and steaming road apples , his arm moving with an unangered and unimpassioned rhythm while in his jeweled fist an eight-foot drover 's whip cracked and flashed across the shoulders of a man who scrambled , crablike , up the road before him . What did he do ? I whispered in a sickened breath and felt my own flesh cringe under those booming , skillful whip strokes and watched , each time , as the fluffs of lint sprang into the air beneath the whip 's sharp tongue . He voted for Black Abe ! cried the drayman , and spat through his red beard at the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Douglas man ! Someone ought to stop him , I thought to myself , but it seemed  | somehow the unmanly thing to have said , so I kept still and witnessed it to the end : the man in the black alpaca moving in that unhurried pursuit of the other : his arm moving in that lazy , vicious sweep while the thin and polished thong of the delicate whip would seem to pause and gather itself in outrage the split second before it wrapped in quickening coils around the other 's arm or shoulder or face until at last the quick tip licked in with finality and a moment later the frozen air would shock to the pistol crack of it . The pursued one seemed unable to get to his feet to run and so he scrambled before his assailant on all fours , like a crippled dog , sideways , his cries grating on the air like a hoarse , long gasp and most of his cheap linsey jacket lashed from his shoulders now and his shirt itself beginning to rip and explode into lint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! bawled the drayman and a slaver of brown amber dripped in his red beard . Whup the son of a bitch a good lick for me , French ! But none of the others spoke and none moved to stop the drama and it seemed that each of them stood transfixed in spellbound speculation at this tiny parable of a headlong wrath : the clash of blood kinsmen in the roads . And when the drama had drawn abreast of the knot of men on the store porch the whipped man gave one last choked scream and fainted face first amid clumped , steaming balls of fresh horse dung and the other stopped and stared down a moment , bemused , and seeming to find final justice in this humiliation itself , folded his whip and stared into us with dead , arrogant eyes . If he 's not dead , Carly , I 'd be obleeged if you 'd fetch him in and wash him up . I 'll send my nigger Jason around to pay you for your troubles and fetch him home in the rockaway at sundown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace of winter trees , his fine boots ringing clean on the warped bricks while the sheriff and his four deputies stood watching from the courthouse verandah aghast and helpless as they had stood throughout . Before the thaw ! muttered the old pilot again , moving back into the warmth of the store . He blew into his hammed fists and stamped his boots and then spread his black jacket like a crow 's wings before the red halo of the stove . Before the thaw ! he muttered again and each of the others eyed his neighbor dumbly , trying to ferret in that instant of naked emotion the sentiments behind the eyes . But presently all stares fell again to  | the stove and the heat soothed their blood and each huddled , dumb and thick with his own speculations , glaring into the bulging belly of the stove 's false , momentary comfort and let the thrumming voice of the flame say what each of them wished most to hear . Supper was over and Aunt Sarah sat by the stove peeling apples for a pie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in this : apple pies were her own special province and she claimed stoutly that Toot peeled the fruit wastefully and Suse never sliced the quarters thin enough and betwixt the two of them they always put in too much cinnamon to suit her taste . Suse and Toot were busy making candy for Christmas Day which was only two days off . Away in the pantry they were buttering pans and fussing over the stove where pots bubbled thickly and a witchery of spices laced the steamy air . Thomas , Christmas is nigh here , Aunt Sarah said in a soft absent voice and watched the red and white rind uncoil like a cunning ribbon beneath the winking blade . Yes 'm . The birthday of our Lord , she went on . The time of rejoicing and Christian love ! Yes 'm . She sat a spell longer and I fidgeted to be out of the kitchen and up to bed but I knew she would call me back at the first step . I think it 's a good time of the year for you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom ? I 'd as soon not talk about that , Aunt Sarah . Gracious , boy ! What 's wrong ! You 'd think poor Catherine Ellen had the leprosy or something ! I reckon I 'll be getting up to bed now , Aunt Sarah . No , wait , Tom . Stay a spell and hear me out . I sighed and kneaded my hands together restlessly and stared miserably out the window at the thin moon , old and waning in the apple-tree bole . Do n't crack your knuckles , Thomas . It 's common . Yes 'm . And the ticking of the clock in the faraway hall was like the measured rap of a cane I had used to hear wandering the house in that hour of evening .  | Bless my soul ! she sniffed . I surely hope I 'm not to blame for the ill feelings between the two of you ! No , ma'am . It 's nothing to do with you . Then all you need to do is go to Catherine Ellen and say  --  I forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgive her what ? Lord , I ca n't rightly remember even that . Well , I remember . I mind it clear as if it was yesterday . It was because she blasphemed and carried on and sassed me to my face that night of the storm . You would n't be much of a man if you had n't got mad at her for that . But still ? . Yes . I reckon it was that . ? but still that 's past . Something that 's gone . And Christmas is a time for forgiveness , Thomas . I do n't want to feel I 'm to blame for any hatred ! No . That 's not it . There 's more . More to what ? More to my hating her . Then what in Time is it , boy ? I can almost see the shape of it sometimes . Yes 'm , I can fairly see it when the lamps are out . When I 'm lyin ' in the bed at last . Hate has n't got a shape , Thomas ! Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a good dose of calomel for your liver . Pshaw . Such talk for a young boy ! It 's what I see though ! What 's it look like ? she whispered sharply and I sensed something cunning and craven in her voice and shot her a quick look but the wink of lampshine on her spectacle lenses hid the truth . It 's something  --  something that swells ! Something that swells in the dark . And I 'm afraid to look ! Aha ! That 's the Devil all right . Maybe you 're speaking the truth , boy ! Yes , I said , knowing something about my fear for the first time . But it 's kindly beautiful , too ! Yet there 's no word for it ! There 's words  --  if a body listens to the biddings of Providence ! There 's no words for some things . Such as which ? Nothing . Go on , Thomas . I ca n't abide it when you start to say something and then do n't finish . There 's no words for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I hate Cathie . That 's one thing . Thomas , I want no more talk of Hate in this house tonight . Yes 'm . I 'm sorry . I wish I knew the word for it . The air seemed suddenly full of soft whisperings like the brush of wings and I closed my eyes and felt my sweating fingers dig into the harsh cloth on my knees and heard the whisperings and each of them a word and yet I could not hear what that word might be , nor even know if it were the word of hating or of something as yet unknown : a softness , worse somehow than Death . Whatever grudge you hold against that girl , my Aunt said suddenly , I 'd be obliged if you was to have it out with her . I 'd never strike her , I said . Well , I should hope not . I 'd never strike her , I said again . Because I know it I struck her once it would n't stop with that . What do you mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night . Me  --  and her ! ? hitting each other ! Or something worse ! Lord . I ca n't name it . I ca n't see it ! It 's part of the shape of hate I see in the dark ! ? the swelling black shape of it . That 's the Devil . I thought you 'd made up your mind what that was ! Yes . Yes , I know ! It 's the Devil ! But why wo n't he let me be ! I pray ! Prayin ' do n't help it though ! God hears you . Then why do n't He help ! Sometimes when the wind 's blowin ' in from the river I pray out loud  --  thinkin ' maybe He ca n't hear me with that wind a-whinin ' in the windows ! So I pray louder than the wind ! You know little about God 's ways , boy ! He hears the cry of the sparrow above the storm . And all He 's waitin for now is for you to go to Catherine Ellen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of Christian love : Christmas ! take her hand , I say , in Christian love ? ! Love ! Love ! Yes , that 's what I said  --  love ! Not the shameful , whoring lust of the flesh ! I mean the kind of love that mortals had before the Shame in the Garden  --  before the snake ! Snakes ! Lord yes ! I think I can remember snakes in my dreams ! Sure you can ! Sure ! Because it 's the Devil that gives you those  | dreams . And the only way you can get shed of those dreams is to fill yourself with God 's love ! The kind of love  --  yes , the kind of pure love I had for my father . That 's what I mean , Thomas . Now she put the pan of peeled , gleaming apple slices down with a jarring out-thrust and sat upright again in the chair  --  her hands outstretched a little with fingers spreading as delicate as the fingers of a girl  --  her face tilted and rosy suddenly with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you only knew how much I loved him ! she whispered . I watched her , mesmerized at this sudden trance of feeling that obsessed her . It was the pure love of God ! she said . There 's nothing I would n't have done for that sainted man if he had bid me do it ! Nothing ! And , Thomas ! When he died and they laid him yonder in the parlor with the candles lighting the poor , quiet clay of him  --  I had no regrets ! None ! I grieved him as if it was a part of me they was to bury in the forenoon of the day that followed . But I had no shame ! No regrets ! I had given him every spark of love in me  --  do n't you see ? And when they buried him they buried that , too ! And I never tortured myself when he was gone with doubts that I had given him all of me that was worth giving . Do you understand that , boy ? Your Uncle Joe never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he come home that very night sour and foul with demon drink and walked right square into the room where your sainted Grandfather lay a-cooling for the grave  --  with the breath hardly gone out of him , I say ! Joe went right in there and slapped that holy face of my father ! Did I ever tell you that ? No , I reckon not ! And there was n't man enough in him that he 'd ever tell you . Just as there was n't man enough in him ever to stand up to my father when he was alive ! No , he waited till he was cold and stiff and cooling before he raised his hand to him ! I saw it with my own eyes . And do you know something , boy ! I was glad ! I was glad because it meant that in the end of it all it was my father that had won  --  had beaten Joe clean to earth ! Now do you know why he took to dope ? ? why he went mad ? ? why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . You condemned me for it and censured me for a cruel , heartless wretch ! Ay , and I will allow that Dulcie and Willie Curtis and that wretched Cox woman whispered and gossiped a-plenty over that ! But you see they never knew ! Nobody knew . Nobody , I say ! Ah , what a cross I have borne  --  what a life I 've wasted ! Wasted , Thomas ! Living with a man for all those  | years  --  the cream of my youth  --  wasted with a man who was n't fit to shine my sainted father 's boots ! That was why God punished your Uncle Joe and took the blessed sight from his eyes ! It was a judgment ! Her voice had risen and she leaned forward in the lamplight and bit the word off at its ending . A judgment ! she cried again . And yet that very night when he done that shameful , cowardly , rotten thing  --  slapped the cold clay of a dead man 's cheek  --  that same night , I say , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whoring , Devil 's lust ! And I rose up and drove him from my room with my parasol , I did ! Because the clean pure love of my father was still in me , boy ! And that 's why I say if you pray to God to give you that kind of love he 'll save you from the other  --  the rotten , Devil 's kind . That 's why I say now at Christmas is the time for you to square things with that girl . I 'll give you a silver dollar tomorrow and I 'll expect you to ride to Elizabethtown in the morning and buy Catherine Ellen a little gift for the season ! A gift . Something fitting and genteel  --  something proper for a young man to give a young girl in fatherly love . A gift ! I cried . She would throw it in my face ! No , she would not . For I 've talked to her this afternoon . About me ! You had no right ! No right , Aunt Sarah ! Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this home . When I am dead and gone you may do as you choose . What did you say ? As much as I 've said to you , she said . And a few things more . There are things that I would say to her as a woman that would mean nothing to you . I got up on cold , wooden feet and went to the threshold of the door while she rose and gathered up the pan of apples and went to the long table to roll the pie-crust dough . What  --  shall I buy ? I whispered , not to her , not to the room even . Something proper , she said . I think a book of verse would be genteel . Mister Whittier 's works seem decent enough . Carly Juniper stocks a few books . Tell him it 's for me . For you ? Yes . He would n't understand if you was to tell him it was a gift for her . And I went up the pantry steps then and crept on cat 's feet past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrawn , wild smile on her lips . The summer tints fluttered like peddler 's calico in the coal fire and I slipped like a shadow into the quilts and clenched my lids tight against the nightmare 's onset . But the encounter with Aunt Sarah had benumbed me past dreams ; so that I lay fisted in the clasping grip of dreamless sleep : in a blackness so profound that when I waked at last in the cold , blinking light of winter morning I half expected to find my body smeared and dappled with Night : like the flesh of a soot-grimed chimney sweep . Dusk of that Christmas Eve and I stood by the roan mare at the hitching rail before Carly 's store and stared at the silver dollar in my palm . It is no eagle , I reflected , it is a dark bird of prey : a raven or a chicken hawk . And I turned the coin and stared at the bland crowned profile . It was no goddess ' face pressed into that soft , treacherous silver : it was the profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deception : 1845 . A fool could tell by the feel of the coin that it was older than that : why , it was old as deception itself . I stood a spell more , staring at it and then looked up at Carly 's window : the lamp burning like a cold gold crescent on the chain from his rafter , and the old river men huddled in their eternal winter around the false summer of the stove and it was Christmas Eve in Elizabethtown and decent folk drew close to one another in family kitchens and eyes were warm with fireside and loving . I had ridden to town that morning and hitched the mare at the railing and gone up the steps and knocked the snow from my heels and clutched the coin in my mittened palm till the milling cut my flesh and on the very threshold of Carly 's store such a wave of fear laid siege of me that I turned and fairly ran down those steps again . All that numb cold day I had wandered round the village , trying to fetch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamed me when I thought of its innocence : all that was required of me was to buy a book of verses for a girl . And yet I could no more do it then I could snatch an eye from my face and lay it on Carly 's counter ; and I think I would have sooner done that . The coin hung thick and heavy in my cold mitten all that livelong day and once , blue-lipped and bone-sick with chill , I went into the courthouse long enough to warm myself at the roaring log of fat pine that bubbled and burned in the great fireplace of the outer hall where the big back-country  | cattlemen and sheep-raisers had come to stand and warm themselves with up-turned coattails and stamp their mud-crusty boots on the floor . I seemed to find among these men a safe anonymity that I could never feel among the bird-bright , nibby eyes of the faces round Carly 's stove . These were back-country faces : flat and uncurious : men who had long ago lost their tongues in the loneliness of country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possum woke and the raccoon and the black bear took his paw from his mouth and itched and twitched awake in his cave beneath the dripping March thaws . Because it was Christmas Eve they had come to town to glance at one another and buy a ribbon for a woman and a candy for a child and have a dipper of fire from Carly 's black whisky hogshead and then go stand and stare in the courthouse fire for a spell : finding in these gestures what , to them , amounted to almost roistering festivity after long nights up Hog Run and Granny Creek and the nights by the fire when the woman had no words for anyone but the crying child in the cradle of her shawled and weary arms . None of them looked at me as I stood there among them  --  or , if they looked , they said nothing , asked no questions , and if any among them guessed my misery he respected it and saw some counterpart of his own condition . And now and then I would feel the coin again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that cold afternoon , while I wandered the town like a beggar , I envisioned that climactic scene . Cathie ? She would not speak at first . She would be sitting on the splitbottom chair in the kitchen watching Toot stuff the goose and pretending I was not there at all . Cathie ? What is it , Thomas ? I got you a present ! a voice of me murmurs somewhere in the thick stillness . Let 's see it . And my tongue is dead and I stand there like the stone angel above my mother 's grave and hold the package out : a genteel book of verses wrapped in the brown , stained storepaper from Carly 's counter and she takes it and opens it and stands looking at it a moment in lip-curling disdain and then carries the thing yonder , dangling it like a piece of offal between finger and thumb and drops it in the coals of the oven and watches it burn and curl and gives it a poke every now and then with the poker to see that each leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all gone she turns to me again , her mouth lifted still in disdain and waits . And I wonder what she waits for and yet I know how desperate that waiting is and I know that now has come the moment of climax : the gathering-in of that old and awful harvest : the fruit of the nightmare sowing . And I move toward her and we collide in the black and choking encounter : bare-toothed and claw-fingered : limbs striving and pressing for purchase on the floor boards . Now the encounter rages full-tilt in my fancy : that same struggle that I have known in so many raging dreams and the dark hair of the girl is roped in my fist and I draw her head back and stare at her cheek and the bone beneath and the lip drawn back from her white teeth and her eyes rolled back wild beneath the lid drawn taut and quivering . What now ? My blood beats like a drum in my chest and I feel the sharp coin in my fist and I stare up at the dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What now ? Aunt Sarah has driven us together at last into the encounter that she has foreseen from the outset : that same fleshpressing , back-arching struggle that I have known in dreams : sweating and striving beneath the quilts . What now ? An act more soft than murder : an act of darkness more profound than the deepest sword 's thrust . I stand with the winter wind from the ice-clutched river twisting my ear like an aunt 's pinching fingers and I see in this vision of that encounter with Cathie the spectacle of black rams struggling upon their bleating ewes on the hillside below Dulcie 's , below the fenced-in yard of the sleepers among the trees . I see again a sight that has haunted my childhood : an encounter common to every spring , before winter is gone , before the wake-robins nod in the hollows ; the struggle of hugging forefeet : the hen beneath the treading barnyard cock and the bawling cow before the bull 's ruthless mounting onset . A book of verses for a girl . A cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an alien Christmas . For these things my Aunt Sarah would betray me into an act of unspeakable darkness . I walk up the steps to Carly 's door and open it and walk inside . The old rivermen stir like cold hens , ruffling and blinking upon the perch of speculation , and none bother speaking : the general eyes fall back to the stove 's scarletcracked door . Tom Christopher ! Well , Merry Christmas , boy ! Merry Christmas ! What 'll you have ? What kind of  --  what kind of ? ?  | What say , Tom ? I stared at him , calm now , and found my tongue at last . Did you know my Uncle Joe ? Joe Alexander ? Well I reckon I did ! Knowed him like a brother ! What word do you get from him , boy ? Does them folks at the Home ever write ? What did he used to drink ? Eh ? What did he used to drink ? Joe Alexander ? Why , applejack , when he was drinkin ' ! But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teetotaler for many a year ! Had n't he ? Say ! Do n't tell me that was why she had him put away ! How much is applejack ? He squinted one eye at me and shifted the massive quid of tobacco a little in his sagging , polished cheek . Who 's it for , Tom ? For Doctor Willie ! I lied in a star-flash of inspiration . So he went and fetched a stone jug and a cob-stopper and a funnel and drew a half-gallon from the dripping spigot of the hogshead . Now he pounded the cob home and shoved it cross the counter . A dollar , he said , and I tore off my mitten and fairly threw the coin across the time-worn hollow in the counter beneath his knuckles . Merry Christmas , Thomas ! he called to me as I moved to the door with the jug ring hooked in my finger . And the same to Doctor Willie when you see him ! But I forgot to tell him that . Even when he found me long hours later : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : found me when he came to me at last , curled fouled and sick and laughing by the porch of the Tanners , under the cold creaking sign of the Mammoth Boot : found me after a whole afternoon of searching in the streets of Elizabethtown , missing me , I would suppose , by a moment 's mischance at every turn . And when he found me at last with the jug half drunk and the rest spilled on the hard frosty cobbles and my own tears and sickness frozen on my chin  --  when he helped me to the buggy I forgot to wish him Merry Christmas as Carly had said I should . Here , Tom ! Let me help you ! Doctor Willie was crying out . And I struggled at last into the buggy and turned my twice-seeing eyes to focus on his face , shawl-bound beneath his tall gray beaver hat . Steady , Tom ! I 'll get you home in a jiffy !  | Ca n't go back there ! I cried to the fierce , forgiving star of Bethlehem , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pshaw now , Tom ! Sure you can ! And you 'll be there directly ! I declare , boy ! Set back now before you pitch headlong out of the buggy and break your neck ! And even in the spinning yard , with the gold square windows of the house whirling in the sick dark above me and the wrathful figure of Aunt Sarah shifting and dissolving in the yellow kitchen doorway and Coy and the Negro women thrusting hands under my arms to help me along and Doctor Willie behind me with the hartshorn bottle choking me at my nostrils : even in that final and desperate instant my hands kept searching through my out-turned pockets for it : certain somehow that it was really there : steadfast in my faith that at the final dreaded showdown on the threshold I would close my fingers on it at last : a slender volume of verses by Mister Longfellow : the genteel gift of Christmas for the dark , grave-eyed girl whose white solemn mask seemed , amid all that swirling , sickening ringing-round of enemies , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes closed , I thought , and the day will not be . Keep your lids shut and do not try to wet your leather-dry tongue and keep your face tight against the pillow , and Christmas Day will go and will not see you here . But there seemed such a commerce of footsteps coming and going past my door and always there was that pause before my threshold and the silence while eyes softly accused me ? that at last I opened my eyes and cringed under the affront of morning . Aunt Sarah stood in my doorway with the Bible in her right hand and the bonnet on her head which told me that she had been up the whole night , attending me . Are you awake now ? I closed my parched mouth on my wooden tongue and tried to dampen it enough to answer . She watched , bemused and with that withering patience in her eyes , and kept her finger in the pages of the black Book of God . Yes 'm , I said at last . Then get up and wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Toot will fix you some breakfast . I allowed that she would commence sermonizing with that , but to  | my surprise , she did not and when I opened my eyes from a long aching blink she was gone . Toot snickered and glared at me by turns and kept my platter heaped with buckwheat cakes and my stone china cup full of sputtering-hot coffee . I felt my temper crouched in my throat like a watchful dog ; hoping that she would say one slight word of censuring , but she kept busy at the stove . And Aunt Sarah came into the kitchen while I was eating and I paused with a mouthful of buckwheat and syrup and kept the mouthful unchewed while I felt her eyes on me and waited for the sermonizing to begin . Merry Christmas , Thomas , she said and stood a split second more , watching me , and I felt the food in my mouth sour and grow heavy and when she turned and swept into the hallway I opened my mouth and spat it into my plate and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the hot coffee . You best drink some more coffee , Mistuh Tom ! No . I 've had enough . I mind when Mas ' Joe used to wake up with the solemncollies he used to drink a whole pot full of coffee and half of de second ! Shut up . I do n't want any more coffee . I got up on quaking legs and walked to the door and stared out the window at the blue shadows on the snow of that Christmas Day and a cold bird nodding , half-frozen on the fence by the smoke house . Where 's Catherine Ellen ? I whispered to the bird but it was Toot that answered . She tuk off dis mornin ' to call on Miss Dulcie ! I felt my knotted stomach turn and I hiccupped in soft agony . Miss Sary was fit to be tied , Toot whispered . I thought for a while hit was de end . The end of what ? A body has a right to call on neighbors on Christmas Day . Not on Miss Dulcie dey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitten . There 's many she would claim was n't fitten today , I said sourly , and hated Cathie for being at Dulcie 's for it was where I would be myself . And I knew what a blue smoke of gossip would be rising in the tiny low-ceilinged parlor as Cathie told them all of the night 's wild events . I sho hope Miss Sary waits till de thaw ' fo she turns dat girl out in de roads like she say !  | When did she say that ? You heard her ! Many 's the time ! And today she said hit again ! She say de onlies ' reason she hai n't turn her out this mornin ' is ' cause it 's de day of Jesus ' bornin ' ! And what did Catherine Ellen say ? What you care ? You 's de one dat 's done most of de hatin ' round here . Shut up . I never asked you for impudence ! Just answer what I ask ! She humped , frozen with affront and , pouting , watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands rolled in her apron . What did they say this mornin ' ? What did who say ? Aunt Sarah . Catherine Ellen . Whatchu mean  --  what dey say ? Dey say " Merry Christmas . " And den Miss Sary tells me to put de goose in ! You know what I mean , Toot . What did they say about me ? Nothin ' . That 's a falsehood . And you know there 's a special corner of hell for liars , do n't you ? Ai n't no lie . No . I reckon not . I reckon they just sat there and thought about me  --  thought how low and common I was . Just like my Uncle Joe . Did she say that , Toot ? Say which ? Never mind . I glared out the window at that string of congenial hearth smoke curling up from Dulcie 's chimney and I thought : She 'll be fixing tea for her now and giving her a slice of fruit cake and pumping her for more of the scandalous news . But Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he would not betray me and because he is a drunkard and knows a few whys . What did I do last night ? I whispered to the string of smoke upon the cold slate skies but it was Toot that answered . You got drunker than Tommy Peacock , said Toot , mentioning the name of the fabulous toper who roared and wailed on moonstruck summer nights along the willows on the river shore above Powhatan . I do n't mean that . I know I got drunk . You think I need you to tell me that . There was something else I did  --  after I got home .  | You fell down right yonder by the pump , said Toot , the corners of her gray lips twitching with beginnings of impudent laughter . I did ? Why did I do that ? Was I  --  was I chasing anybody ? Chasin ' ? Be dog if I know . Mebbe you was chasin ' you own shadder ! If you was a man I swear I 'd whop you , Toot ! Sometimes you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knowed why you fell down ! It just ' peared to me like you got sleepy all of a sudden and direckly you just went limp as an empty corn-meal sack and went a-pitchin ' . I sucked my lip and watched the cold bird nodding in numb , deathly dreaming and then started suddenly as it revived and flew off with a cry toward the orchard as spry as could be . You sure I did n't  --  hit anybody ? I whispered to the empty fence : to the place where the bird had been . You hit de floor a right good crack , said Toot , and I got so mad at that I went off to the parlor and closed the door behind me and stood there in that chilled , muslin-ghosted room and threw back the dusty cloth that covered the empty chair where Uncle Joe had rocked away his life and sat in it , staring at the black window blind , and the myriad stars in the pinholes of it . So certain was I that in the whirling mystery of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I actually thrust out my upturned palms and searched them for the stains of blood . Then I buried my face in them and sat a while listening to the dry tiny flakes of new snow strike in faint hissing gusts against the windowpane and down on the river road a faint furry chinking of sleighbells waned and ebbed in the frozen waste of midday country silence and the high voices of caroling girls fainted at last like a ghost of summer beyond the furthest orchard reaches . What had I done ? It seemed to me that the high crime of drunkenness merely stood to shield my recollection from some other , blacker sin . But I could not name it . I edged the window blind up enough to rest my chin on the sill as I had done so often in the evenings at the feet of the God of the Three-Penny Piece and now I squinted at the fresh fall on the sill outside and suddenly saw plain as a child 's trinket the stellar intricacy of a fantastic snowflake : its lace all delicate and wondrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made that plain and comprehensible since it was His hand that had shaped them both . He . Yes , He would know what I had done . He would know more of it than she even , and I looked at my  | hand again in the still light from the window : that light as lambent and cold as silver that shone on my yellow palm and I knew now that I was looking not for blood but for the blush that striking something would have left across my fingers . He . His face . Someone had slapped it once . But He had not felt it there in the shine of those cold , old candles because He was dead and He would rock and judge no more in His high room . And the door opened . And she came to stand there with her finger in the same book but now in the chapter of a further prophecy : that Book  --  its leather black and wrinkled as a purse and the gold of its cross long since flaked away in those long Sundays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , Thomas ? she said . What do you mean ? You know perfectly well what I mean . I do n't have to repeat that . Are you comfortable in your Uncle Joe 's chair ? I looked back for the snowflake on the sill but it was gone and I felt a pang of loss ; as if Reason in the universe had been disputed . Because you look mighty suited to it , she went on . You fit it as if the carpenter had made it for you . She came further into the room and slowly my eyes traveled from the windowsill across the dusty rug and up from her black peeping shoe tips , up and up her dotted swiss skirts past her apron , past her black alpaca shirtwaist to the twinkling black jet pin at her throat and to her mouth . But I did not look above her mouth : not to her eyes : my looking would not go that high . It 's too bad , she said softly but with a whispering , deadly slash like the cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandfather is not a-lyin ' yonder in his coffin with the candles shinin ' on him . You might get up and go over just as he did and raise your hand ? . No ! I would n't ! And what you did last night ? ? that was n't just as bad ? To bring drunkenness into his home on the Eve of Christmas  --  to spew on Christmas as if it were a gutter ? That was n't just as bad ? All right . But do n't say what you said . I would n't have done that ? I would n't have hit a dead man . No ? Well the time will come when you 'll have fallen low enough for that . You 're marked for it . I watched her mouth working softly and swiftly as fingers tying a stubborn knot .  | I sat the whole night by your bed , she said . I 'd do that for a sick dog . And I watched you toss and turn in your drunkenness and heard you mutter such vileness ? . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own mouth with it . Tell me ! What did I say ? Imagine any vileness that you can . That will be what you said . I would n't repeat the vilenesses you spoke . I only know that now I see how your childhood was spent and it makes me ashamed before God that I raised you . What did I say ? Please , in God 's name , tell me , Aunt Sarah ! And how could I have not seen it in your face when you 'd come in of an evenin ' for supper  --  when you 'd lift your mouth to be washed clean of jam  --  when you 'd pray at my knees ? How could I not have seen it there ? What ! Seen what ? Seen the shadow of it ! she whispered . That you 'd been lyin ' in the orchard spyin ' on the vileness of ram and ewe  --  of hen and cock in the barnyard . That you 'd hunkered there behind the smoke house watching the service of the bull . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a body could raise a window to Hell and crouch listening for a night  --  they would hear what my ears heard by your bed last night , Thomas Christopher . You 'd never tell me when I used to ask ! Tell you what ? What they were doing out there  --  the ram and the ewe ! Lord , I can still hear the poor thing cry ! Hush ! You never asked me . If you 'd ever dared ask me I 'd have washed your mouth with lye ! I did ! I asked you many 's the time . Never . Never . Well I still do n't know . It 's a darkness . It 's a thing worse than killing . That 's all I know . Yes . At least you know that . God has not abandoned your soul entirely it would seem ! I only came to you today to tell you that I will not abide drunkenness in my father 's house . I would not abide it with my own husband I will not abide it with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's child and when you were orphaned by the flood I  | took you in because it was my Christian duty . But I will not abide drunkenness . If I ever so much as smell elderberry wine on your breath ever again I will send you out to make you own way . You 're a man now , Thomas , and I 'm not obliged to keep you . I know . As for her  --  I plan for her to pack up and leave in the spring . I 'll not send her out in the winter . Where will she go ? Where she belongs . To find work as a servant . Or worse . Yes , I said . I 'm glad . You 're glad of what ? Glad that you 're sending her away . It was her fault that I done what I done last night . Blame no one but yourself for your own misdeeds . God knows she 's got enough blackness on her soul without you adding yours . But it 's true , I breathed , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me until I could n't stand it no more . I wandered around Elizabethtown the whole livelong day with that dollar you gave me ? . I 'll expect you to work that off , she said . That was from my seed money and spring planting 's not far off . ? until I could n't stand it . It was just like God kept saying to me that something awful would happen if I spent that dollar on her . I just kept looking at it and it seemed like it was money as filthy and betrayed as the silver they paid Judas . Perhaps so , she said . But do you reckon you made the money any cleaner by spending it for rottenness and pollution ? No , I reckon not , I said . And I ask your forgiveness . I give it to you , she said . Because it is Christmas Day . I think if it were any other day I would drive you out . I hate her , I whispered and saw something gleaming and shining in the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would not turn my head to see if it was a candleshine or not . Which is why you must never drink again , she said . What ? Which is why you must never touch that hellishness to your lips again . Now  --  when you are sick and sober  --  you talk a good enough Christian . What do you mean ? You sang a different tune last night .  | What do you mean ? You called her name the livelong night as if she were your own mother ! It was the drink talking in you ! I did n't ! Do n't contradict me . I was the one who had to sit there in the rum-stinking darkness and listen to it  --  that and all the other filthiness you were babbling ! I was the one that had to keep the quilt over your mouth so 's you would n't have her coming to answer you . She heard me ? I asked in a quaking , feeling the sweat spring in cold beads across my brow . Suse and Toot heard you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catherine Ellen heard you  --  in the next room . What did she say ? She never stirred . Had she dared to come answer you in the state you were in I 'd have driven her out into the snow in her nightdress . But , no matter . Just try to imagine my feelings , Thomas Christopher ? I who have tried to raise you as a Christian mother might have done  --  to hear you cry out the name of that young trollop in your shameful , drunken madness . She stood a spell more and still I sensed that dull gleam in the corner of my eye and could endure the fantasy no more and turned my head to see . But it was only the music box , caught in a random ray of daylight , a-shining in the corner of the parlor . And when Aunt Sarah left me suddenly I felt the silence quicken and put my eye to the cold window again and searched with a child 's panic for the safe cold logic of a snowflake . But all my eye saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was time enough to repent : a whole week of the old year left ; time enough for the wildest resolutions . And yet I do not recollect having made any : can not , for that matter , recall any thoughts at all but a pained yearning for the old year to be done and forgotten . But the black stain on that Christmas would not soon be laundered out . Returning homeward , the caroling girls had halted their team and sled on the river road and come whooping up the drifts to our doorway Christmas night and gotten halfway through a chorus of Adeste Fideles when Aunt Sarah came to the door and silenced them there by the black-iron deer with the memorable news that " Christmas is dead in this house ! And not even your young voices can raise it up  | again ! " And they stopped and stared at each other 's bonneted , applecheeked faces and giggled with bewilderment and trudged somehow shamefully back to the buffalo robes and warming pans in the sled and whipped the mares back to Elizabethtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had turned and stared at me in the cirde of the lamp in the hallway and closed the door behind her . Yes , Christmas is dead , she said again and stood a moment more with a sock on the darning gourd in one hand and the threaded needle twinkling like the tiny sword of God 's wrathful Michael in the other . And it was me that killed it , I said , staring at the rug . She sighed and shook herself and edged past me toward the stairs , shaking her head as she went . I think God is weary of us all , she murmured on the steps . And she went up to her room to darn and shut the door and when I passed it there was that slender thread of gold burning on her black threshold and as I moved toward the small lamp in my room I heard her voice again , to herself . Dear dear dear ! Lordy , Lordy ! Save us all ! And her rocker quickened and paced the creaking boards with a voice like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of the old year to go : seven days before a dying of a time . And it seemed to me then that whatever bell tolled the sick year 's ending it would ring to its grave the child in me and seal the stone against all resurrection . The year 's last breath . And the soft sough of winter winds against the shutters might have been , for all its gentleness , the quickening trickle of those last sands in the glass . The time a-dying . And I could not be sure if my joy at the old year 's flight could comfort me sufficient to stand against my fears for the year to come . War before the thaw , the old pilot had said . And , at nights , I dreamed about that , too  --  and somehow the struggling dream armies mingled with the violence of that other encounter , with little enough to distinguish one from the other . And I wondered wildly what I had really said that night in my drunkenness ; what she had heard ; what secret she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a decade of my life to have that night 's follies struck from being . It seemed that for so many years I had kept my soul secret : like a small and special room full of many things : dark things , proud things , things of shaming and things of shining : things that festered like scraps of food on old plates and things that shone like jeweled fireflies in a  | black wood . Things that I had kept since childhood , since before that even , locked against all inspection , especially hers . Most especially hers . And then in a twinkling of a spinning cartwheel dollar on the counter of a general store I had flung the door wide and held the lamp high for them to see and led them in , skirts a-swirling , eyes a-picking and a-spying , lips whispering and gossiping at the dark , bright , wondrous , shameful and terrible things in my secret room . I tell you honestly : in that week I despised them both . It seemed that-they had both bested me in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often that week I saw in Aunt Sarah 's face a thin-lipped satisfaction at what I had done : as if something in her bleak religion had found vindication in my undoing , and more than once those last seven days I caught her studying me over her darning gourd , a faint ghost of a smile playing in the tiny wrinkles of her mouth 's corners , unawares . And often I lay awake in my tiny room , eyes lost in the fire-shadows on my ceiling , and stuffed the quilt end in my mouth for fear I should cry out even more secrets to the mocking girl in the room down the hallway . Lord , how I hated her for that : for having heard , for knowing something about me that I should never know . What was the vileness that I had cried out ? Aunt Sarah had said it was about the black ram and the ewe on the hillside paths ; the red bull working out his spring mutinies on the hips of the sprawling , bald-eyed , braying cow . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springtime as long forgotten as Eden 's last April : a season in my childhood when Cathie and I went down the dusty road to see Abijah 's wondrous boat . And when we had wandered the decks for an hour , like pilgrims in a white temple , Cathie said she thought the river was not too cold for a swim in the shallows at the mouth of the creek under the hair of the willows where the single frog cried his croaking , busted-banjo tune . And in my dream we ran there and she stood flinging off her dress and as she tugged her coarse black cotton stocking from her leg I stared and saw that her feet had turned to hooves as shining black as a cow 's horn . And I dared not let my eyes look higher at her and kept my vision fixed in horror at those two girl-hooves planted and stamping in the buttercups while the pantaloons and petticoats tumbled round them . And I commenced now to cry out her name and heard no sound but the neigh of a mad ram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet I heard black hooves strike fire on the meadow stones and felt black wool wrap me round and a wrath gathering in my sheep-loins and felt myself  | gone mad with the stamping of my own misshapen legs and the black wool curled tight upon my cringing skin . I woke then , with some voice of me echoing in the room , and knew that I had been crying in my sleep again and lay a-quaking . And then I began to wonder what she had heard when I cried out . Was it the voice of the mad ram ? What was it ? Was it the vileness Aunt Sarah had hinted ? And yet it seemed to me that the very stillnesses of the hushed winter night seemed to echo my voice and I could heard them : those faint cries under the mulling of the cotton comforter : Cathie 's name . And that was somehow worse . I lay still as a stone and felt the cold pressed upon my face heavier than the bed clothes that cocooned me in the warmth of body heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled as I was , I supposed at first it was some last suspiration from the coals in the grate or the numb tiny feet of a mouse wandering the walls of the house in winter misery . A sound fainter than either of these sounds it was , and then it came again and I turned my head swiftly on the bolster and felt the cold pour down my exposed and perspiring neck as my eyes strained through the blue dust of that starshine and saw a white wraith in my doorway . The figure did not move , and stare as I might my eyes could not give it the blessed shape of recognition : the mark of mortality which would dispel , at least , my belief that one of the many ghosts that wandered that house had come to avenge itself upon me for some dream-spoken affront . I thrust my hands to my face and dug my thumbs against my lids until red rockets puffed and burst upon my vision . And when I looked again the shape was gone . But the fact came peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it thrust its hand around my throat . It had been Cathie . She had heard me cry her name in the frosty silence of the house and had risen and come to my door . Cathie . Cathie . It would not be Aunt Sarah . She slept with her head stuffed in a nightcap of thick knitted wool and her door was always latched against the rest of the house from the time her candle was snuffed until dawn rose blue-staining on her windows . Cathie . Cathie . She had heard me and come . But what had she come for ? I flung back the bed clothes and felt the cold wash me like a wave of water and my toes curled on the icy floor as I swung my legs down and stood in my nightshirt staring round me in the darkness . I dared not light a candle . I wished for a way to quench the revealing star in my window . And I crept slowly toward the door to the hallway . But there was no one there and my cold feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my fingers spidered down the cold wall toward Cathie 's door . I knew every board , every square Wheeling nail of that house and I knew where to put my feet so that no wood cried out . Standing at last on the threshold of her room I stared through the velvet darkness . The dust of that same star that lay frozen in my window had painted a faint blue checkering on her bed and I could spy her shape beneath the white quilt . Softly I stole toward her and at last was able to bend , and see the shape of her face , nested in the black tumbling of her hair . I listened . Her breath came slow and long and yet I peered closer to be sure and presently I could make out the twin fringes of her lashes on the lids cupped in sleep round her eyes and the curl of her small dark nostrils and her mouth , and I saw that it was swept up faintly at its corners in a sly and maddening smile . I stood there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insuperable impulse to snatch back her bed clothes and wring her soft shoulders in my fingers and shout to the whole sleeping house the question in my mind . What did you hear ? What was it ? What did I cry out ? What is my secret ? But I stole back to my own bed presently and heard the clock chime three before my toes uncurled and my teeth lay still against my tongue and I fell asleep with the firm resolve that I would dress before cock 's crow next morning and ride the roan mare down the frozen road to Fish Creek and spend the morning on the decks of Abijah 's boat . For it seemed now , there among the white pure solaces of the steamboat 's carved lattice and her flashing pilot-house panes , between the tall stacks : in a last and desperate innocence , that I should find again the talisman to a time that was fading : a time that would come no more . The sky over the river hills was just staining with daylight as the mare picked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there had been only the diamond brilliance of the morning Venus hanging between the pots of Dulcie 's cold chimney . By the time I had reached the place , morning had come up and the sky was pearly with it and I could see the first ray of sun flash like a torch on a pane in the pilot-house window . The boat was heaped and frosted with snow like one of Toot 's twenty-egg cakes and the morning wind soughed a cold , lorn song in her fancywork . The air was cold and thick with winter : like sluggish , icy water as I swung down from the  | mare and kicked my way through the drifts to the shore . But I knew the same child 's joy as I felt again the decks under my heels and heard the faint , half-hearted chime as the bell sang under the razored rush of wind . I went to the texas deck and stood there until my face grew numb in the rushing air and then I kicked the crusts of snow from the threshold of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed it open . There was a box of fat pine sticks that some long-ago deck hand had cut and stored there and I found a lucifer in a box of mouse-nest odds and ends and made a little fire in the potbellied stove and warmed my numb fingers . Now the morning stood high and crystal over the river and the wind cracked like a banner . The house of Aunt Sarah stood far off up the rolling bottomlandsa black box in the snow . I stood with hands outspread to the glow and began to feel what I had come there to feel : a renewal of old religion , of some ancient , nursery safety and then I knew quite surely and with an almost feral sensing that I was not alone . And I remembered suddenly having seen the small , neat footprints in the snow leading down to the boat : they were five minutes old : no more . Cathie had walked the road long before me and had fled at the sound of the mare in the dark and lurked somewhere up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bright-eyed bird . As the air in the pilot house came alive in the reviving warmth I felt my cheeks flush with anger . It seemed to me suddenly that the Nellie Queen had always been mine : that it was I who had granted her leave to come here and not the other way round . Again I felt that angry , choking sentiment of invasion and I went to the windows and scanned the land all round for some sight of her . I glared like an angry king at the scrub pines and brush but there was no sight of her . And then I smiled at the thought of her out there somewhere blowing on her blue fingers while I warmed myself in Abijah 's own throne room . Perhaps by now she would have furtively climbed the rise above the creek , behind the laurel thickets , and gone down through the waistdeep meadow drifts toward a place where she could take to the road and walk home without my ever seeing her at all . I turned with a smile of pleasure and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts were heaped and commenced leafing through them . And then suddenly , and with the crack of a pistol shot in my ear , one of the small panes in the window above me disappeared and shards and splinters of glass showered down on me and a rock spun through  | the air and struck the pilot wheel and clattered to the floor . I jumped to my feet and stared toward the river and saw her then , standing on the bluff above a crazy , snow-burdened clump of frozen laurels : her scarf twisted round her angry face , its loose ends blowing like smoke in the wind ; her fists on her hips and her legs set apart , like a pirate . She looked like a wild creature of the woods come down to forage among the county henhouses : her moon face stained with angry flushes and her black eyes sparking outrage . I moved to the broken pane and felt the wash of hateful , cold air pour in upon me . But I said not a word . And neither did she . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew with a sudden , happy flood of feeling that I had found here in Abijah 's boat what I had come a-seeking . I was not afraid of her here . And that did not even seem curious to me . It was true . Standing here in this fantastic palace where we had played as children I was no more afraid of the dark girl than I would have been of a she-wren a-pecking and a-staring on the pantry windowsill . Even if she had broken that long year 's silence and called out to me now the black curses that curled like smoke behind her eyes I would not have feared her there . Even if she had come a-springing onto the boat deck with her apron sagging with rocks I would not have feared her . It was almost as if , away from that dark house of my Aunt , she meant a different thing : as if here , in the pilot house of the King 's white boat , she were suddenly diminished to the measure of a foolish , scolding child , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to shatter , and suddenly she whirled and went scrambling up the drifts to the ruts of the road and stumbled stalwartly off alone up the bottomlands for home . I stood a while more : proud and cruel as as Emperor : stalking the little pilot house that had become to me suddenly the longed-for and far-quested fortress of final safety . Womankind could not touch me here . And if Abijah were King , indeed , there might be another mortal head to fit that crown before the tale be told . I stayed till the sun hung halfway in the sky , frozen and halted in the wintry wind , hovering as if it lacked heart to complete its day 's journey . And when the mare neighed in the cold and pranced in panic under the creep of frost up through her hooves I went down and mounted her and made for home . Aunt Sarah was in the kitchen supervising a bubbling kettle of potato soup while Toot fretted and mumbled and said she knew how to make potato soup long years before the Ark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was too cold to make a show of lying so I looked away from her eyes and told the truth . We need stove wood ! she said . You might have better spent the morning chopping stove wood than wandering the decks of that old wreck . I said nothing , still keeping my eyes from hers , lest she spy there the fresh and nearly treasonable resolutions that the morning had given me . Did you have words with Catherine Ellen ? No 'm . Did n't you have a fight with her this morning ? Answer me truthfully , Thomas ! No , ma'am . You still do not speak ? No 'm . And I went off to the parlor then to sit till dark , till suppertime , till that hour of family falseness when we must each gather and speak a blemished psalm of thanksgiving for the bitter food and to stare at one another in a kind of black covenance : an act of war even in the breaking of bread . I sat a long spell , leafing through the ladies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good feelings of the morning , of the moment on the boat , and yet feeling them ebb slowly from me like a slow well of blood and gently as mildew the old house began again to set its claim upon me . I heard a footfall in the hallway , behind the high , closed door and turned at that sound , wondering if perhaps Aunt Sarah had come to listen at the crack , in hopes that I might be given to speaking to myself in the daytime as she had heard me speak in sleep . And I rose and crept shuffling across the carpet and stooped and put my eye to the crack in the bottom panel of the door and saw a strip of calico so hated and familiar to me that it was all I could do to restrain an outcry . It was Cathie who had come a-stealing from her room , come a-sneaking down the stairs and to the parlor door and stood now to eavesdrop upon me even in my daylight solitude , as I knew well she listened at the midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched my fingers toward the green brass latch to throw it up and swing the door wide and at that instant I heard the dry scratching whisper of paper and saw the small folded sheet of it slide beheath  | the door under the toe of my boot . I snatched the paper up and almost tore it in my eagerness as I opened it to a ray of fainting dusk light and read what she had said . You have n't got the right to go to the Nellie Queen any more . I gave it to you and now I take it away . We are not friends and it is my fathers boat and you have n't got any right there . I could hear her slow , clenched breath beyond the thickness of the door and I knew that she heard the intake of my own in outrage as I turned and searched the parlor for a pencil to make my answer . I dashed across the rug to Uncle Joe 's old writing desk and tore a drawer open and filled the air with scattered deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at last , chewing my tongue , and shaping out my reply in black , clumsy letters beneath her own . Fish Crik is on Christopher land and I will go whey I pleas . I rushed back to the door and put my eye anxiously to the crack to be certain she had not gone away and then stuffed the white paper through the crack and watched till it moved and the white triangle of it was snatched from the other side . That had struck home , I knew , and smiled at her gasp of rage and heard the dull , pecking pace of the pencil a moment later as she shaped the letters of her rebuttal . The white corner scratched as it poked through again and I grabbed it and pulled it into the room and lifted it to read . If Abijah was here he would kill you for trespassing on his boat . I broke the pencil point in my next furious scrawl and had to pause while I chewed away the wood until there was enough lead to finish . But Bija @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if he wus . Now I pressed my ear again to the cold , varnished panel and listened to her slow , furious breath as she read and then the pecking of the pencil again and presently the paper 's edge came peeking through the crack and I snatched it up and read again . The first stone I threw is not the last . And I do n't care if I break every window in the boat . You have no right . And I hunkered again and scrawled my retort in that failing light , my shoulder against the wall like the prisoner of some dungeon world , waging a furious paper war with the inmate of the cell beyond my own . My aunt sary will thro you out in the roads where you cum frum to begin with . Let her ponder that for a spell ; let her think of this while winter  | crouches like a gray cat above us in the sky and gnaws the house like a cold , white bone . And I stuffed the paper through with such violence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and press the wrinkles out before it would go through and now her quick breath as she read was an audible sob and I shut my eyes and leaned my cheek to the cold wood and smiled to think how final and ultimate this threat would always be . But she was not defeated yet and I held the paper up again to read where she had written : I am going anyways in the morning . And now victory began suddenly to capsize and sicken and I searched for space on the paper to shape the black letters of a " Where ? " The answer was short in coming back and I had to take it to the window now to make out the lace of words in the last gray dust of afternoon . Anywheres . I can not abide it to live here anymore where a person is your vilest enemy by day and then calls for you of a night . In that moment I was glad to be far from the door : thankful that she could not hear my short , sore gasp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was true that she had come and stood in my doorway that night ; wondering , perhaps , in justice , which me to believe : the black daytime Tom who despised her or the white wandering spirit of me in the night , a-crying her name . I scrawled the cramped black words a final time and read them with silent , working lips to be sure of what I had said . That is a lie . You heared the wind that is all . And yet when I fell to my knees by the door and pressed my eye to the crack for that glimpse of calico and felt the cold , tiny draft against my cheek I knew that she had won again . She had gone and now I stood up and pressed my ear to the door again to be sure she was not hiding there , beyond the wall , and at that instant Aunt Sarah called supper and I heard Cathie 's slippers go padding off toward the kitchen . I opened the door and stood a moment in the hallway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces that I stuffed into the pocket of my jacket . Then I slipped swiftly up the stairway to the little room and saw through the space of the half-opened door the dusty faded flowers of Rebecca 's old carpetbag , packed and ready on the floor beside the washstand . So she had not threatened idly : she was going , in truth , and now I listened as Aunt Sarah called to me from far away in the downstairs and yet louder than this I heard the  | gathering drum of my blood and knew that before the light of that morning stained the windows of the house a time of showdown would have come and gone . Once Aunt Sarah 's voice had ended its brief grace we fell quickly to the sullen meal and though I did not look at her I could feel her quick eyes darting from my face to the lowered eyes of the girl and back again , over and over , in a dumb , swift shuttle . There were times when Aunt Sarah was like the black cock of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch the drift of the faintest wind of feeling that stirred in the house . And tonight with such a storm of emotion raging soundlessly between myself and the dark girl she sensed it as surely as if we had sat there at our places and screamed across the dishes . But she held her tongue till supper was done . Very will . Out with it ! What 's the trouble between you two ? I lifted my eyes first to Aunt Sarah 's face and then moved them sullenly to the pale lowered lids of Cathie . She had finished eating and now her hands stole softly from the cloth and twined in her lap and her lips thinned to a stubborn line and the very rise and fall of the breasts beneath her shirtwaist seemed to cease . Speak up ! I 've had enough of this pouting and mooning around ! I declare I never saw two young people take on so ! What 's the trouble ? You have n't so much as said good morning or good night for the past twelve months ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet brooch at her puckered collar seeming to bespeak her impatience . Young lady , speak when you are addressed ! And in that instant when the gold tears sprang to her lashes and her lips unclenched to make the shape of fear and grief Cathie sprang to her feet and fled in a rush from the kitchen and was gone before the milk from her upset tumbler had commenced its soft drip on the floor . Thomas ? You will tell me . What is wrong in this house ? And I met her eyes without faltering and got up from the table and pressed my napkin into the beef bone ring . Good night , Aunt Sarah . Sit down there at the table again , Thomas . I 'm not done yet . Aunt Sarah , I 'm sleepy ? .  | Not so sleepy that you ca n't hear me out . I mean to have an end to this thing once and for all before the year is done . So I stood a moment longer , though there was nothing more to be said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , though tomorrow there might be . For something in the air of that winter 's night spoke to me and said that the time of a reckoning was at hand and that more than our black pact of silence would be broken before the sunrise came . Yes , even as I stood there my legs quivered and yearned to be up the stairs and to my bed , while something in the upper rooms seemed whispering with a blind , soft urging : Quick ! Come away ! Come away ! Answers are awaiting you here ! A phantom struggle to be ended and another begun , an act of darkness to be fashioned upon the flesh of the night , a secret to be manifest at last . Do you hear me , Thomas ? Yes 'm . I 'll pray for you tonight as I do every night . I advise you to do the same . Your soul is sore sick , boy . I do pray ! And you should read your Scriptures more . Now I stood up , all wildness unleashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her till my heart scorched before it . Scriptures ! I cried . Is that what you want ? All right ! Here 's some Scripture words ! And I caught up an empty china plate from the cloth and raised it above my head and hurled it smashing against the copper skillet hanging on its nail above the stove . " Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies . " There 's your Scriptures for the day , Aunt Sarah ! And I dashed from the kitchen and into the hallway and she called after me twice and then fell silent as I moved panting and exhausted up the stairs and down the hallway past the latched door to Cathie 's tiny room where the gold thread of her fireshine quivered like a blade in the blackness and I listened to the faint , smothered sobs of her , face down in the faded quilts . And as I undressed before my fire these sounds subsided and I crept among the covers and watched the red shapes dance among the rafters and heard the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reckoning is nigh and the showdown impends upon the waxing of the moon . And there was pulse to the very darkness of night and it gathered and beat in my palms . And the clock struck , blowing its hoarse , brassy breath nine times down the  | black silences and I listened as Aunt Sarah labored up the stairs and moved to my door and stood a moment by the threshold and I heard the dry , faint whisper of her lips and knew she had begun that praying she had promised me . And presently I heard her door fall closed and the latch slip sharply into its slot and she seemed gone from my life forever and the sands seemed running thinner and thinner in the glass . I can not ever believe that it was a mere mortal hour until the clock chimed again . It seemed to me in that space of ticking time that kingdoms had flowered and fallen in the meadows of Carthage and Babylon and mighty trees had rotted and gone to soil and rains had fallen in the river and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oceans beyond China and sucked up in the clouds that bore down once more upon our river hill in endless , ancient cycle . Cathie ! my voice and the last chime of ten awoke me and the echo of both died a-mingling . And I saw her then in the doorway , the white shape of her stained by fireshine and her eyes yellow with it and the gold of the blowing coals sparking in her dark , tumbling hair . And the night pressed roaring in my ears , wild with victory and I struggled up and faced her across the room where she stood now , framed in the window with the cursed , cold sickle of the moon caught like a white dogwood blossom in the dark curl that framed her livid cheek . She was there and this was waking and yet the dream was reality and I felt the cold shock of my naked feet as they bore me on the bare floor boards and it seemed that the clock had gone mad in the hallway blackness and gone a-chiming in riotous amuck so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bare yard from me now , her face a-tilt and mad with something , and the carved , dark wood of her curls thick round the puckered throat of her gown and somewhere I heard my voice again cry out that damned name of her and I felt the onrush gather and saw her face for one final instant before the dark encounter , before the resolution of it : her eyes staring like the glass eyes of a doll and her lips curled in a grimace of passion and then I heard her name again and the night burst into flame . And it was come at last : the fearing and the shaming come at last : the act of darkness born of a dream and flaming now like a haystack burning in a wind . The knowing of it faint and lost in the drum of blood : dragging her back with me into the warmwomb of the quilted , secret night and now the dark ewe bleated on her spring-cursed hill and I heard the pain of my teeth striking hers  | and the hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud and swollen comb and her arms went fighting round me and the whole night boomed about us like a peddler 's drum on the roads . And now the dream more real and yet more terrible than in sleep : desperate and fantastic beyond the telling and more violent in its lustfulness : her flesh tearing delicately beneath the thrust of it and her voice in my ear like a hot wind wailing : hoarse and wanton with blood-heat and now the noiseless , secret , sacred hinges of elbow and thigh rocking in their immemorial accord and the night was light and the Grandfather God in the high room roared and railed , helpless to rise , and stamped His cane impotently upon the resounding floor . And after a while I floated up like a drowned sailor from the salt seaweed caves of her deeps and lay fainting on the soft shores of her oceaned flesh and opened my eyes and said her name again .
